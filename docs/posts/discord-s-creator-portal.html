The writing‚Äôs not just in this blog, but </span><strong>also my daily checkins</strong><span>, </span><strong>writing a bunch of comments on Zulip</strong><span>, and even </span><strong>some small musician / song capsules</strong><span> at the end of my checkin posts to add a bit of color to them. And there have been </span><strong>some other one-off writing bits </strong><span>as well, like </span><strong>the niceties I wrote about my fellow batchmates</strong><span> at the ends of their batches and </span><strong><a href="https://recurse.notion.site/Ed-Younskevicius-s-favorite-links-for-learning-about-programming-2566d44747894fdeb6d565ba7baab969" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">the added context I wrote for my favorite programming links</a></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>I think </span><strong>the most important thing about writing</strong><span> here, as always, </span><strong>was how it clarified my thoughts</strong><span>. Every time I wrote a blog post about something here, </span><strong>I found that I understood that subject a lot better</strong><span> and could talk about that subject a lot better later with other people. </span><strong>I also learn a bunch when I research for those same posts</strong><span>; for example, when </span><a href="https://mytimeatrecurse.substack.com/p/week-4-self-reliance" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">I wrote about Phoenix</a><span>, I learned a lot more about Chris McCord‚Äôs history with the project, and how that history affected the design, by researching and finding a post from him at the </span><a href="https://fly.io/blog/how-we-got-to-liveview/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">fly.io blog</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, </span><strong>other people have regularly reached out to me about my writing at Recurse</strong><span>, too, and told me about how it helped them, or shared the thoughts they had about the same topic (sometimes similar to mine, sometimes different). </span><strong><span>I think it‚Äôs what ‚Äúlearn generously‚Äù from </span><a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">the self-directives</a><span> is all about ‚Äî it allows others to learn from you, and you from them, by sharing your work in public</span></strong><span>. And </span><strong>getting responses from Recursers</strong><span> ‚Äî who, in my experience, tend to carefully read and provide thoughtful, kind feedback ‚Äî </span><strong>feels great, too</strong><span>!</span></p><p><strong>I‚Äôd spend more time talking you into the benefits of writing</strong><span> blogs, but </span><strong><span>the Recurse Center already has it </span><a href="https://blaggregator.recurse.com/about/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">pretty well covered</a></strong><span> (towards the bottom). Especially, the two </span><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">blog</a><span> </span><a href="http://garann.com/dev/2013/how-to-blog-about-code-and-give-zero-fucks/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">links</a><span> on the subject there do a fantastic job with why blogging is good for you (and why we all want you to blog too! üôÇ)</span></p><p><strong>In terms of how it‚Äôs made my writing better,</strong><span> </span><strong>I tried to</strong><span> ‚Äúwork at the edge of my abilities‚Äù (another self-directive) and </span><strong>write a lot while I was here, and also write in a lot of different ways</strong><span>. So partly </span><strong>I‚Äôve learned to write faster</strong><span> (and not be as precious about it, as I‚Äôve sometimes been in the past), and partly </span><strong>I‚Äôve learned to write in more diverse ways</strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Also, especially with things like the niceties, I think </span><strong>I‚Äôve learned at Recurse some how to better write what‚Äôs uniquely good about a person or their contributions, or at least my feelings about them</strong><span>. It‚Äôs hard, and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve always 100% hit the mark, but </span><a href="https://www.mindful.org/an-introduction-to-mindful-gratitude/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">practicing gratitude</a><span> has transformed my life for the better over the last 10 years, and I think I‚Äôve leveled up at least some with that by getting to practice it a lot here.</span></p><p><span>Lastly, </span><strong>RC has been a nice, safe place to practice being vulnerable in public via writing</strong><span>. This excellent recent </span><a href="https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/43-making-friends" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">blog post</a><span> I got from Hacker News, about how to make close friends, mentions vulnerability as a key part of establishing connections with others, and I feel that‚Äôs been really true for me over the years. (I think it‚Äôs important to be vulnerable to be a good writer and write interesting stuff that people actually want to read, too.) </span><strong>My fellow batchmates were so nice and supportive, in fact, that I even ended up sharing a piece of writing about my father‚Äôs death from brain cancer</strong><span> in response to a piece another Recurser wrote about his father passing away.</span></p><p><strong>It‚Äôs been a little scary at times</strong><span> to put all this stuff about me and my experiences out there, and sometimes I worried that I wasn‚Äôt qualified to speak, or that I‚Äôd written something bad, or that people might think I was stupid, or weird, or narcissistic, or a million other worries. </span><strong>I hope my attempt to put stuff out there anyway and to be vulnerable in this blog, with a lot of the warts and messiness left intact, might help at least a couple of you reading this</strong><span> out there to do that as well, because I really want to read all of your diverse voices and experiences too!</span></p><p><strong>One thing I‚Äôll say to those of you reading who might want to be writing some yourself </strong><span>at Recurse (or other places): I think you really, really should! But </span><strong>it takes </strong><em><strong>a lot</strong></em><strong> of time</strong><span>. Each blog post I‚Äôve written generally takes me about a hour or hour and a half to write. I probably spend an hour a day in aggregate writing comments on Zulip. Each checkin I write takes about a half-hour, and the little song thing I throw in at the end of my checkins takes about a half-hour also. Writing niceties for people ending their batches took me a few hours, both times. The piece explaining the rationale behind my favorite programming links took a few hours to write as well. Etc., etc., etc.</span></p><p><strong>And I‚Äôm not saying this to brag, or discourage anyone. </strong><span>In fact, </span><strong>I think getting all this writing done</strong><span> </span><strong>has mostly been about making time for it</strong><span>, rather than any amazing skill I might have as a writer, and </span><strong>I think most of you out there can do this too, if you can find the time</strong><span>!</span></p><p><span>That said, </span><strong>I‚Äôve had a decent amount of experience writing</strong><span>, so for people who haven‚Äôt done that much writing before, </span><strong>it might take longer for you to write stuff</strong><span>. </span><strong>I think all that time I spent was well worth it,</strong><span> but it‚Äôs important to say that </span><strong>I‚Äôve paid for it in some ways, by not getting more coding done or spending as much time pairing and chatting with other people here at Recurse</strong><span>. If you want to actually get writing done regularly, I‚Äôd say to </span><strong>make sure you‚Äôre being honest with yourself about the time it will take</strong><span> and the tradeoffs you‚Äôll have to accept as a result.</span></p><p><span>Finally, one last thing I‚Äôll say is: </span><strong>write the hard things especially.</strong><span> </span><strong>The blog posts or comments or even song descriptions that were the most difficult for me to write were inevitably the ones I learned the most from and that I got the most positive feedback about.</strong><span> If writing about something feels complex or difficult, I‚Äôd say to lean into that, even though it‚Äôs really hard, and give yourself the time to struggle with those pieces of writing.</span></p><p><span>Anyway, </span><strong>TL; DR: Writing is good! You should do it! And I want to read what you write!</strong></p><p><strong>Next time</strong><span>: Who knows? I want to remain open to possibility here as I come up on my last week. Maybe I‚Äôll do a silly project to finish things up with a bang. See you then!</span></p></div></div></div>
