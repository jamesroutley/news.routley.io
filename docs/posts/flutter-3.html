<p>Flutter released <a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2019/02/launching-flutter-12-at-mobile-world.html">version 1.2</a> at Mobile World Congress
(MWC) in Barcelona. For more information, see the
<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/release-notes/release-notes-1.2.1">1.2.1 release notes</a> or <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/releases">download the release</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, here are some recent new and updated docs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We’ve updated our <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/intro">state management advice</a>.
New pages include an <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/intro">introduction</a>,
<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/declarative">thinking declaratively</a>, <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/ephemeral-vs-app">ephemeral vs app state</a>,
<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple">simple app state management</a>, and
<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options">different state management options</a>.
Documenting state management is a tricky thing, as there is no
one-size-fits-all approach. We’d love your feedback on these new docs!</li>
  <li>A new page on <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/best-practices">Performance best practices</a>.</li>
  <li>Also at MWC, we announced a preview version of the new Dart DevTools
for profiling and debugging Dart and Flutter apps.
You can find the docs on the DevTools wiki
(Note: since moved to <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/devtools">this site</a>.)
In particular, check out the DevTool’s <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/devtools/inspector">widget inspector</a> for
debugging your UI, or the <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/devtools/performance">timeline view</a> for profiling your Flutter
application. Try them out and let us know what you think!</li>
  <li>An update to the <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/perf/ui-performance">Performance profiling</a>
page that incorporates the new Dart DevTools UI.</li>
  <li>Updates to the <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/android-studio">Android Studio/IntelliJ</a>
and <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/vs-code">VS Code</a> pages incorporating info from
the new Dart DevTools UI.</li>
</ul>
