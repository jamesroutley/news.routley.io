What you are reading was originally a <i>book</i>.  Nowadays, most learning
about technical topics such as 3D math and video game programming is done online,
so some readers may have a tough time visualizing what a technical book
might have looked like.  If this describes you, see <a href="#book_anachronism">Figure 1</a>.

</p><p><span>
<span>Figure 1</span><span>Physical media was once used to communicate technical knowledge</span>
</span>
</p></div><p>
It contained such anachronistic features as an ISBN number, an index, a bibliography,
numbered chapters, sections, and pages, and strings of prose not broken up
into 280-character chunks, such as the run-on-sentence you are now reading.
This physical manifestation of knowledge weighed over 4 lbs, giving it many
advantages over online form factors.  It could be used to prop open a door or
support a monitor at a desired height.  You could collect physical books and display
them on a shelf as an expression of your identity—real or aspired—and this worked
whether or not you had actually read them!  But the greatest advantage of a physical book
was that you could tell at a glance how long it was.  You are reading an 850 page book.
</p>
<p>
Also, this book was published in 2011.  In 2011, <i>League of Legends</i> was
two years old, <i>Skyrim</i> had just been released, and the PS4 was still two years
away.
But we&#39;re proud to say that most of the material in this book, like Bilbo when
he still had The Ring, hasn&#39;t aged a day.  Vectors and matrices work the same
way, <mjx-container jax="CHTML" role="presentation">

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>F</mi></math>

</mjx-assistive-mml>
</mjx-container>, and people <i>still</i> use Blinn-Phong.
</p>
<p>
However, some parts of the book are starting to showing their age a bit.
The two least theoretical and most practical chapters
(Chapters <a href="https://gamemath.com/book/graphics.html">10</a> and <a href="https://gamemath.com/book/dynamics.html">12</a>) in particular
could benefit from an update and a shift of emphasis.  We don&#39;t cite any publication
or website younger than a decade.  The jokes and cultural references—borderline to
begin with—are  now all dated.  We&#39;ll be working on this; you can help by
<a href="#feedback">providing feedback</a>.
</p>


<p>
This book is about 3D math, the geometry and algebra of 3D space. It is designed to
teach you how to describe objects and their positions, orientations, and trajectories in 3D
using mathematics. This is not a book about computer graphics,
simulation, or even computational geometry, although if you plan on studying those subjects, you
will definitely need the information here.
</p>
<p>
This is not just a book for video game programmers.  We do assume that a majority of our readers
are learning for the purpose of programming video games, but we expect a wider audience and we
have designed the book with a diverse audience in mind.  If you&#39;re a programmer or interested in
learning how to make video games, welcome aboard!  If you meet neither of these criteria, there&#39;s
still plenty for you here. We have made every effort to make the book useful to designers and
technical artists.  Although there are several code snippets in the book, they are (hopefully)
easy to read even for nonprogrammers.  Most important, even though it is always necessary to
understand the surrounding concepts to make sense of the code, the reverse is never
true.  We use code samples to illustrate how ideas can be implemented on a computer, not to
explain the ideas themselves.
</p>
<p>
The title of this book says it is for “game development,” but a great deal of the material that
we cover is applicable outside of video games.  Practically anyone who wants to simulate, render,
or understand a three-dimensional world will find this book useful. While we do try to provide
motivating examples from the world of video game development, since that is our area of expertise
and also our primary target audience, you won&#39;t be left out if the last game you completed was
    <i>Space Quest</i>.<a href="#footnote_1">1</a> If your interests lie in more “grown up” things
than video games, rest assured that this book is <i>not</i> filled with specific examples from
video games about head-shots or severed limbs or how to get the blood spurt to look just right.
</p>


<p>
This book has many
unique features, including its topic, approach, authors, and writing style.
</p>
<p><span>Unique topic.</span>  This book fills a gap that has been left by other books on graphics,
linear algebra, simulation, and programming.  It&#39;s an introductory book, meaning we have focused
our efforts on providing thorough coverage on fundamental 3D concepts—topics that are
normally glossed over in a few quick pages or relegated to an appendix in other books (because,
after all, you already know all this stuff).  We have found that these very topics are often the
sticking points for beginners!  In a way, this book is the mirror image of gluing together books
on graphics, physics, and curves.  Whereas that mythical conglomeration would begin with a brief
overview of the mathematical fundamentals, followed by in-depth coverage of the application area,
we start with a thorough coverage of the math fundamentals, and then give compact, high-level
overviews of the application areas.
</p>
<p>
This book does try to provide a graceful on-ramp for beginners, but that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ll be
stuck in the slow lane forever. There is plenty of material here that is traditionally considered
“advanced” and taught in upper-level or graduate classes. In reality, these topics are
specialized more than they are difficult, and they have recently become important prerequisites
that need to be taught earlier, which is part of what has driven the demand for a book like this.
</p>
<p><span>Unique approach.</span>  All authors think that they strike the perfect balance between being
pedantic and being chatty in order to best reach their audience, and we are no exception.  We
recognize, however, that the people who disagree with this glowing self-assessment will mostly
find this book too informal (see the index entry for “stickler alert”). We have focused on
perspicuous explanations and intuition, and sometimes we have done this at the expense of rigor.
Our aim is to simplify, but not to oversimplify. We lead readers to the goal through a path that
avoids the trolls and dragons, so why begin the journey by pointing them all out before we&#39;ve
even said what our destination is or why we&#39;re going there? However, since we know readers will
be crossing the field on their own eventually, after we reach our goal we will turn around to
point out where the dangers lie.  But we may sometimes need to leave certain troll-slaying to
another source, especially if we expect that your usual path won&#39;t take you near the danger.
Those who intend to be on that land frequently should consult with a local for more intimate
knowledge. This is not to say that we think rigor is unimportant; we just think it&#39;s easier to
get rigor after intuition about the big picture has been established, rather than front-loading
every discussion with definitions and axioms needed to handle the edge cases. Frankly, nowadays a
reader can pursue concise and formal presentations
    <i>free</i> on Wikipedia or <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com">Wolfram MathWorld</a>, so we don&#39;t think
any book offers much worth paying for by dwelling excessively on definitions, axioms,
    proofs, and edge cases, especially for introductory material targeted primarily to engineers.
</p>
<p><span>Unique authors.</span>  Our combined experience brings together academic authority with
in-the-trenches practical advice.  Fletcher Dunn has been making video games professionally
since 1996.  He worked at Terminal Reality in Dallas, where as principal programmer he was one
of the architects of the Infernal engine and lead programmer on <i>BloodRayne</i>.  He was a
technical director for The Walt Disney Company at Wideload Games in Chicago and the lead
programmer for <i>Disney Guilty Party</i>, IGN&#39;s E3 2010 Family Game of the Year.  He now works
for Valve Software in Bellevue, Washington and has contributed to Steam and all of Valve&#39;s recent
games.  He is the primary author of the <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets">GameNetworkingSockets</a>
networking library and the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/multiplayer/steamdatagramrelay">Steam Datagram Relay</a>
service.  But his biggest claim to fame by far is as the namesake of Corporal Dunn from
<i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</i>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://ianparberry.com/">Dr. Ian Parberry</a> has more than 35 years of experience in research
and teaching in academia. This is his sixth book, his third on game programming. He is currently a
tenured full professor in the Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering at the University of
North Texas. He is nationally known as one of the pioneers of game programming in higher education,
and has been teaching game programming classes at the University of North Texas continuously since 1993.
</p>
<p><span>Unique writing style.</span>  We hope you will enjoy reading this math book (say <i>what</i>?)
for two reasons.  Most important, we want you to <i>learn</i> from this book, and learning
something you are interested in is fun.  Secondarily, we want you to enjoy <i>reading</i> this
book in the same way that you enjoy reading a work of literature.  We have no delusions that
we&#39;re in the same class as
    Mark Twain, or that this book is destined to become a classic like, say,
<i>The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</i>. But one can always have aspirations.  Honestly, we are
just
    silly people.  At the same time, no writing style should stand in the way of the first
priority: clear communication of mathematical knowledge about video games.<a href="#footnote_2">2</a>
</p>


<p>We have tried to make the book accessible to as wide an audience as possible; no book, however,
can go back all the way to first principles.  We expect from the reader the following basic
mathematical skills:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
Manipulating algebraic expressions, fractions, and basic algebraic laws such
        as the associative and distributive laws and the
            quadratic equation.
</li>
<li>
Understanding what variables are, what a function is, how to graph a function,
        and so on.
</li>
<li>
Some very basic 2D Euclidian geometry, such as what a point is,
        what a line is, what it means for lines to be parallel and perpendicular, and so forth.
        Some basic formulas for area and circumference are used in a few places.  It&#39;s
        OK if you have temporarily forgotten those—you will hopefully recognize them when
        you see them.
</li>
<li>
Some prior exposure to trigonometry is best.  We give a brief review of
        trigonometry in the front of this book, but it is not presented with the same level
        of paced explanation found most elsewhere in this book.
</li>
<li>
Readers with some prior exposure to
        calculus will have an advantage, but we have restricted our use of calculus in this
        book to very basic principles, which we will (attempt to) teach in
        <a href="https://gamemath.com/book/kinematics_calculus.html">Chapter 11</a> for those without this training. Only the most
        high-level concepts and fundamental laws are needed.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Some programming knowledge is helpful, but <i>not</i> required.  In several places, we give brief
code snippets to show how the ideas being discussed get translated into code.  (Also certain
procedures are just easier to explain in code.)  These snippets are extremely basic, well
commented, and require only the most rudimentary understanding of C language syntax (which has
been copied to several other languages). Most technical artists or level designers should be able
to interpret these snippets with ease.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/cartesianspace.html">Chapter 1</a></span> gets warmed up with some groundwork that
        it is needed in the rest of the book and which you probably already know.  It
        reviews the Cartesian coordinate system in 2D and 3D and discusses how to use
        the Cartesian coordinate system to locate points in space.  Also included is a very
        quick refresher on trigonometry and summation notation.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/vectors.html">Chapter 2</a></span> introduces vectors from a mathematical and geometric
        perspective and investigates the important relationship between points and vectors.
        It also discusses a number of vector operations, how to do them, what it means geometrically
        to do them, and situations for which you might find them useful.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/multiplespaces.html">Chapter 3</a></span> discusses examples of coordinate spaces
        and how they are nested in a hierarchy.  It also introduces the central concepts
        of basis vectors and coordinate-space transformations.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/matrixintro.html">Chapter 4</a></span> introduces matrices from a mathematical and geometric
        perspective and shows how matrices are a compact notation for the math behind
        linear transformations.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/matrixtransforms.html">Chapter 5</a></span> surveys different types of linear
        transformations and their corresponding matrices in detail.  It also discusses
        various ways to classify transformations.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/matrixmore.html">Chapter 6</a></span> covers a few more interesting and useful
        properties of matrices, such as affine transforms and perspective projection,
        and explains the purpose and workings of four-dimensional vectors and matrices
        within a three-dimensional world.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/polarspace.html">Chapter 7</a></span> discusses how to use polar coordinates
        in 2D and 3D, why it is useful to do so, and how to convert between polar and
        Cartesian representations.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/orient.html">Chapter 8</a></span> discusses different techniques for representing orientation
        and angular displacement in 3D: Euler angles, rotation matrices, exponential maps, and
        quaternions.  For each method, it explains how the method works and presents the
        advantages and disadvantages of the method and when its use is recommended.
        It also shows how to convert between different representations.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/geomprims.html">Chapter 9</a></span> surveys a number of commonly used geometric
        primitives and discusses how to represent and manipulate them mathematically.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/graphics.html">Chapter 10</a></span> is a whirlwind lesson on graphics, touching on
        a few selected theoretical as well as modern practical issues.  First, it presents
        a high-level overview of “how graphics works,” leading up to the rendering equation.
        The chapter then walks through a few theoretical topics of a mathematical nature.  Next
        it discusses two contemporary topics that are often sources of mathematical difficulty
        and should be of particular interest to the reader: skeletal animation
        and bump mapping.  Finally, the chapter presents an overview of the real-time graphics pipeline,
        demonstrating how the theories from the first half of the chapter are implemented in the
        context of current rendering hardware.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/kinematics_calculus.html">Chapter 11</a>
</span> crams two rather large topics
        into one chapter.  It interleaves the highest-level topics from first-semester
        calculus with a discussion of rigid body kinematics—how to describe and analyze
        the motion of a rigid body without necessarily understanding its cause or being concerned
        with orientation or rotation.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/dynamics.html">Chapter 12</a></span> continues the discussion of rigid body mechanics.
        It starts with a condensed explanation of classical mechanics, including Newton&#39;s laws of
        motion and basic concepts such as inertia, mass, force, and momentum.
        It reviews a few basic force laws, such as gravity, springs, and friction.  The chapter
        also considers the rotational analogs of all of the linear ideas discussed up to this point.
        Due attention is paid to the important topic of collisions.  The chapter
        ends with a discussion of issues that arise when using a computer to simulate rigid bodies.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/curves.html">Chapter 13</a></span> explains parametric curves in 3D.  The first
        half of the chapter explains how a relatively short curve is represented in
        some common, important forms: monomial, Bézier, and Hermite.  The second half
        is concerned with fitting together these shorter pieces into a longer curve, called
        a <i>spline</i>.  In understanding each system, the chapter considers what controls the system
        presents to a designer of curves, how to take a description of a curve made
        by a designer and recreate the curve, and how these controls can be used to construct
        a curve with specific properties.
</li>
<li>
<span><a href="https://gamemath.com/book/afterword.html">Chapter 14</a></span> inspires the reader to pursue greatness in video games.
</li>
<li>
<span>Appendix A</span> is an assortment of useful tests that can be
        performed on geometric primitives.  We intend it to be a helpful reference, but
        it can also make for interesting browsing.
</li>
<li>
<span>Appendix B</span> has all the answers.<a href="#footnote_3">3</a>
</li>
</ul>


<p>We calculated the odds that we could write an 800+ page math book free of mistakes.  The result
was a negative number, which we know can&#39;t be right, but is probably pretty close.
