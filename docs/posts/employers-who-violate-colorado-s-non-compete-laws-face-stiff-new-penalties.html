    <h1>Employers Who Violate Colorado’s Non-Compete Laws Face Stiff New Penalties</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Effective March 1, 2022, employers who violate Colorado’s restrictions on post-job non-compete provisions may face criminal penalties, including up to 120 days in jail. In light of these new penalties, GD clients who wish to include these non-compete provisions in their Colorado employment agreements, or wish to enforce an existing version of these non-compete provisions in Colorado, should first reach out to their GD attorney.</p>
<p><strong>The Colorado Statute and Enhanced Penalties</strong></p>
<p>Under Colorado law, a non-compete provision that “restricts the right of any person to receive compensation for performance of skilled or unskilled labor for any employer shall be void,” except for:</p>
<ol><li>any contract for the purchase/sale of a business;</li>
<li>any contract for the protection of trade secrets;</li>
<li>any contractual provision for recovering educational and training expenses of an employee who leaves after less than two years of employment; and</li>
<li>contracts with executive and management personnel and employees who constitute professional staff to executive and management personnel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even when one of these exceptions applies, Colorado courts insist that the non-compete provisions be reasonable in duration and scope. Effective March 1, 2022, a violation is a crime punishable by up to 120 days in jail, or a fine of up to $750, or both. C.R.S. § 8.2.113. It is unclear how or when Colorado courts or authorities will attempt to enforce this amendment. Unanswered questions include: (1) Will employers face these penalties if they include a non-compete in a post-March 1, 2022 employment agreement, only if they attempt to enforce a post-March 1, 2022 non-compete, or in both instances? (2) Will employers face these penalties if they attempt to enforce existing, pre-March 1, 2022 non-compete provisions?</p>
<p><strong>GD’s Contract Generator</strong></p>
<p>GD’s Contract Generator is a powerful tool available to our clients in all 50 states. Using our Contract Generator, clients can create (in a matter of minutes) their own standard offer letters and PIIAs, as well as advisor agreements, mutual NDAs, and one-way NDAs, simply by logging on and answering a few questions.  If you are not already familiar with this document automation tool, please reach out to your GD attorney to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>GD’s Precautionary Measures</strong></p>
<p>In response to Colorado’s enhanced penalties and the lack of clarity regarding enforcement, GD is instituting Colorado-specific safeguards in our Contract Generator tool. Contract Generator will no longer offer a post-job non-compete provision in PIIAs prepared for newly-hired Colorado-based employees. Also, while the PIIA included with our corporate formation materials contains a post-job non-compete provision, that provision has been modified and will not apply to Colorado-based employees in formation materials generated after March 1, 2022.</p>
<p><strong>Contact GD Attorneys before Requiring or Enforcing a Non-Compete in Colorado</strong></p>
<p>Post-job non-competes remain an option in Colorado but a fact-specific legal assessment is more important than ever. Please contact your GD attorney if you would like to include a post-job non-compete in an employment agreement with a Colorado-based employee, or if you are considering taking action to enforce an existing post-job non-compete in Colorado.</p>
