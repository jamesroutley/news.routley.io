    <h1>Ask HN: How are you dealing with the M1/ARM migration?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I love the M1 chips. I use a 2021 MacBook both personally and professionally. My job is DevOps work.<p>But the migration to ARM is proving to be quite a pain point. Not being able to just do things as I would on x86-64 is damaging my productivity and creating a necessity for horrible workarounds.</p><p>As far as I know none of our pipelines yet do multi-arch Docker builds, so everything we have is heavily x86-64 oriented. VirtualBox is out of the picture because it doesn&#39;t support ARM. That means other tools that rely on it are also out of the picture, like Molecule. My colleague wrote a sort of wrapper script that uses Multipass instead but Multipass can&#39;t do x86-on-ARM emulation.</p><p>I&#39;ve been using Lima to create virtual machines which works quite well because it can do multiple architectures. I haven&#39;t tested it on Linux though, and since it claims to be geared towards macOS that worries me. We are a company using a mix of MacBooks and Linux machines so we need a tool that will work for everyone.</p><p>The virtualisation situation on MacBooks in general isn&#39;t great. I think Apple introduced Virtualization.framework to try and improve things but the performance is actually worse than QEMU. You can try enabling it in the Docker Desktop experimental options and you&#39;ll notice it gets more sluggish. Then there&#39;s just other annoyances, like having to run a VM in the background for Docker all the time because &#39;real&#39; Docker is not possible on macOS. Sometimes I&#39;ll have three or more VMs going and everything except my browser is paying that virtualisation penalty.</p><p>Ugh. Again, I love the performance and battery life, but the fragmentation this has created is a nightmare.</p><p>How is your experience so far? Any tips/tricks?</p></div></div>
