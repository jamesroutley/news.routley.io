    <h1>Pharma firms stash profits in Europe&#39;s tax havens</h1>

AstraZeneca, Bayer, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Novo Nordisk, Roche and Sanofi specifically replied on tax issues to say that they comply with all rules. Sanofi insisted that its presence in low-tax jurisdictions was justified by local patients&#39; needs. Bayer said that as a German company, it is taxed on its offshore profits, adding that some of the countries mentioned in this article should not be considered tax havens.</span></p></div><div><div><div><h4>“<!-- -->Corporate tax avoidance is not victimless, fewer taxes mean less investment in healthcare in Ireland and also negative impacts for countries in the Global South.<!-- -->”</h4><p>— <!-- -->Aideen Elliott, Oxfam Ireland</p></div></div></div><div><p><span>Ironically, BMS makes Opdivo in Dublin, at a facility close to Staunton&#39;s home.

Dubbed &#34;the Double Irish&#34;, it has been a common tool for tech and pharma groups to slash their effective tax bill below Ireland’s current 12.5 per cent corporate tax rate. The technique involved setting up two Irish companies: one for operational purposes and the other to hold intellectual property (IP). The first would pay royalties to the second, which would be a tax resident offshore, like in Bermuda.</span></p></div><div><div><div><h4>“<!-- -->&#34;Ireland made changes to its corporate tax residence rules in Finance Act 2014 that are specificIreland made changes to its corporate tax residence rules in Finance Act 2014 that are specifically designed to prevent such structures as the so-called &#39;Double Irish&#39;.<!-- -->”</h4><p>— <!-- -->Irish Department of Finance spokesperson</p></div></div></div><div><p><span>BMS Holdings Ireland&#39;s main direct shareholder is also an Irish outfit with Swiss tax residency.

Investigate Europe analysed the last five years of accounts filed by the 15 largest American and European pharmaceutical groups. Together, they declared 1,300 subsidiaries in tax havens, as of 2023.
