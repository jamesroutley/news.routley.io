    <h1>Calculating the norm of a complex number</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>In this quick post I&#39;ll dispel a common confusion in the basic math
of complex numbers. It&#39;s often useful to calculate the norm-square (also
known as <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AbsoluteSquare.html">absolute square</a>)
of a complex number <em>z</em>. This norm-square is denoted . One
could naively expect that:</p>
<p>However, that&#39;s false! The way to calculate norm-square is:</p>
<p>Where  is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate">complex conjugate</a> of <em>z</em>.
But why? To understand the mechanics of this calculation, let&#39;s start by
defining what a <em>norm</em> is.</p>
<div id="the-norm-of-a-complex-number">
<h2>The norm of a complex number</h2>
<p>Informally, a <em>norm</em> is a generalization of the
concept of &#34;length&#34; or &#34;size&#34;. For a real number <em>r</em>, the norm is its absolute
value . No matter if the number is positive or negative, the norm is
its &#34;length&#34; - the distance from the origin.</p>
<p>A norm is defined similarly for complex numbers. Here&#39;s a standard geometrical
interpretation of a complex number <em>z</em>, showing both cartesian and polar
coordinates:</p>
<p><img alt="Cartesian and polar representation of a complex number" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2024/complex-cartesian-polar.png"/></p><p>The &#34;norm&#34; of <em>z</em> is the length of the blue line, or the distance of its
endpoint from the origin (<a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2024/notes-on-the-euler-formula/">in the polar representation</a>,
it&#39;s exactly <em>r</em>). The norm of a complex number uses the same notation
as the absolute value: , because it means the same thing. Another
common name for the norm of complex numbers is <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComplexModulus.html">modulus</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="norm-a-formal-definition">
<h2>Norm: a formal definition</h2>
<p>The formal definition of a norm (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)">from Wikipedia</a>)
talks about generalized vector spaces. Since complex numbers are also a vector
space (of dimension 1), we can simplify the definition just for
 as follows:</p>
<p>A norm on  is a real-valued function 
with the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Triangle inequality:  for all </li>
<li>Absolute homogeneity:  for all  and
all </li>
<li>Positive definiteness: for all  if 
then .</li>
<li>Non-negativity:  for all </li>
</ol>
<p>For a complex number <em>z</em>, setting  makes all these properties
work out intuitively:</p>
<ol>
<li>Graphically, complex numbers add like vectors; therefore, given <em>z</em> and <em>w</em>,
the length  is always <em>at most</em> the combined lengths
.</li>
<li>When we scale <em>z</em> by a scalar <em>s</em>, its length is scaled similarly. Think
about the polar representation of a complex number: .
Multiplying that by <em>s</em>, we get , which has length
<em>sr</em>.</li>
<li>In the polar representation: if , then ,
meaning that .</li>
<li>By definition, a length is non-negative; it&#39;s the distance from the origin.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="why-z-squared-is-not-a-norm-square">
<h2>Why <em>z</em> squared is not a norm-square</h2>
<p>Now it&#39;s time to go back to the question we started the post with. Why isn&#39;t
 (or ) the norm-square?</p>
<p>For a general , we can calculate  as follows:</p>
<p>This is clearly a complex number, with a real and an imaginary component. It
doesn&#39;t seem to fit the requirement of being a &#34;length&#34; or distance from the
origin, which we&#39;d expect to be a real quantity.</p>
<p>Multiplying <em>z</em> by itself in polar coordinates can be insightful:</p>
<p>It seems like we <em>almost</em> get what we want, because the magnitude of 
is , which seems like the right magnitude for the square of the
distance from origin; but there&#39;s still an angle... Here&#39;s how it looks
geometrically:</p>
<p><img alt="Polar representation of zz" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/2024/complex-squared.png"/></p><p>Recall that when multiplying two complex numbers - their magnitudes multiply,
but their angles add. In this case, we got the  we needed, but with
an angle of , which is not what we need. If only we could get
rid of the angle somehow... keep this thought in your head for the next
section.</p>
<p>Looking at the formal definition of the norm, it&#39;s clear right away that
 won&#39;t do. The norm is defined as a <em>real-valued</em> function, whereas
 is not real-valued.</p>
</div>
<div id="zz-is-a-norm-square">
<h2><em>zz*</em> is a norm-square</h2>
<p>The conjugate  of <em>z</em> is defined as:</p>
<p>Or in polar form:</p>
<p>Recall how we had that pesky angle remaining when calculating ?
Let&#39;s find a way to get rid of it; since angles add when we multiply complex
numbers, to get rid of <img alt="\theta" src="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/images/math/cb005d76f9f2e394a770c2562c2e150a413b3216.png"/> we should multiply <em>z</em> by something with
an angle of . Do you see where this is going?</p>
<p>Voila! Multiplying <em>z</em> by its complex conjugate gives us a real number. Moreover,
it gives us exactly the number we want - . This is the norm-square,
or . The norm of <em>z</em> is  and is precisely <em>r</em>, the
&#34;length&#34; of the complex number.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s verify this works in cartesian coordinates:</p>
<p>Indeed, this makes intuitive sense because:</p>
<p>And this is exactly what we expect when calculating the length of <em>z</em>.</p>

<div id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The norm square of a complex number <em>z</em> is denoted . In this post
we&#39;ve seen why</p>
<p>(even though the mathematical notation makes it seem like this should be true).
Instead, this is how the norm-square is actually calculated:</p>
<p>With the norm itself being</p>

<h2>Appendix: <em>zz*</em> and the formal definition of norm</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s get back to the formal definition of norm and show that 
satisfies it.</p>
<p>First of all, we&#39;ve already seen that  is a <em>real</em> number, no matter
what <em>z</em> is. Therefore, it can indeed serve as a real-valued function
.</p>
<p>The proof of property 1 is a bit tedious,
<a href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Triangle_Inequality/Complex_Numbers">but straightforward using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality</a>.</p>
<p>For property 2, since <em>s</em> is a real number, the square root of its square is
just its absolute value:</p>
<p>For property 3, consider a <em>z</em> such that:</p>
<p>Since neither addend inside the square root can be negative,
clearly both <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> must be zero, meaning that .</p>
<p>Property 4 is similarly straightforward: given real components <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>,
 is non-negative.</p>
