    <h1>Deno 1.33: Deno 2 is coming</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As mentioned in the recent
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVEGRj3RZSA" title="null" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#34;Forced Optimization&#34; presentation at Node Congress 2023</a>,
we&#39;re working diligently towards a major release of Deno 2 in the coming months.
Though our vision for Deno 2 is ambitious, our goals haven&#39;t changed since we
started the project:</p>
<p><strong>Effortless Coding</strong>: Whether that&#39;s removing config, boilerplate code, or
build steps, we&#39;ve continued to make it easy for you to dive into code and be
productive immediately. This release made our LSP more robust, allowing any code
editor with LSP support to work great with Deno projects.</p>
<p><strong>Best-in-Class Performance</strong>: Speed and efficiency is important for developers
and users. This release improved the performance of HTTP and WebSocket servers,
as well as set the foundation for further performance work.</p>
<p><strong>Uncompromising Security</strong>. Security was built into Deno with an opt-in
permission model so you always know what your code has access to. In the coming
months, we&#39;ll be introducing new features to Deno&#39;s permission system, making it
easier and more flexible to work with.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v1.33.0" title="null" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deno 1.33</a> is a step
further towards these ideals. With this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#built-in-kv-database" title="null">Built-in KV database</a></li>
<li><a href="#flatter-denojson-configuration" title="null">Flatter <code>deno.json</code> configuration</a></li>
<li><a href="#fewer-permission-checks-for-dynamic-imports" title="null">Fewer permission checks for dynamic imports</a></li>
<li><a href="#improvements-to-npm-and-node-compatibility" title="null">Improvements to npm and Node compatibility</a></li>
<li><a href="#performance-improvements" title="null">Performance improvements</a></li>
<li><a href="#improvements-to-cli" title="null">Improvements to CLI</a></li>
<li><a href="#lsp-document-preloading" title="null">LSP document preloading</a></li>
<li><a href="#changes-to-deno-apis" title="null">Changes to <code>Deno</code> APIs</a></li>
<li><a href="#changes-to-the-standard-library" title="null">Changes to the standard library</a></li>
<li><a href="#v8-114" title="null">V8 11.4</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As we approach Deno 2, the next minor releases will focus on improving
performance, creating a best-in-class developer experience, enhancing security,
and more robust Node/npm compatibility.</p>
