        Cheap public transport seems like a no-brainer to help tackle emissions. Germany’s example backs it up with strong numbers.
    </p><div><p>A scheme to increase the uptake of public transport in Germany has been hailed as a “huge success”.</p><p>The €49 a month ‘Deutschlandticket’ has led to a 25 per cent rise in passengers on national railway company Deutsche Bahn&#39;s regional services, according to DB Regio CEO Evelyn Palla.</p><p>Launched in May, the ‘D-Ticket’ enables people to take as many buses and local or regional <a href="https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/07/04/inside-the-factory-making-tri-brid-electric-trains-that-could-revolutionise-transport-in-e"><strong>trains</strong></a> across the country as they need. It includes Berlin’s popular S-Bahn network.</p><p>Comparing traveller numbers with April, the Deutschlandticket is “already a great success,” Palla told the German newspaper RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).</p><p>Speaking to German news agency DPA, Germany’s Transport Minister Volker Wissing has also described the ticket as “really a huge success.”</p><h2>How has the Deutschlandticket changed people’s travel habits?</h2><p>Since 1 May, Deutsche Bahn’s records show that Germans are using the D-Ticket to travel “significantly longer distances”.</p><p>Over summer, routes to the coast and mountains are proving particularly popular. That suggests that the scheme is enabling people to make more <a href="https://www.euronews.com/travel/2023/07/09/flight-free-family-holiday-trains-are-cheaper-than-planes-on-these-beautiful-european-jour"><strong>sustainable travel</strong></a> decisions around their holidays.</p><p>Though, as Palla acknowledges, this seasonal flux also partly explains the recent uptick in journeys.</p><p>“The fact that the trains were fuller in May and June than in April is also due to public holidays and the holiday season,” she says. </p><p>“The just under three months that we have now had the Deutschlandticket are not yet enough to paint an accurate picture.”</p><p>Still, the numbers show a promising trend. In the less than three months since its introduction, local public transport (ÖPNV) has seen almost one million new customers, Wissing points out.</p><p>“And we have increased the number of subscribers who are firmly committed to public transport. That means there is not just casual use, but everyday use.”</p><p>Demand for the ticket is still high. According to the Association of German Transport Companies (VDV), 9.6 million passengers used the D-Ticket subscription as of 20 June.</p><h2>Will Germany’s €49 ticket stay?</h2><p>In some regions, “people were travelling as much as in the €9 summer”, Palla told RND.</p><p>The €9 a month deal that ran from June to August last year saw 52 million tickets sold and an estimated <a href="https://www.euronews.com/travel/2022/08/30/9-rail-pass-this-is-how-much-germanys-cheap-train-tickets-increased-passenger-numbers"><strong>1.8 million tonnes</strong></a> of CO2 emissions avoided.</p><p>Although it was incredibly popular with significant <a href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/09/20/five-ways-a-groundbreaking-9-rail-pass-changed-germany"><strong>climate benefits</strong></a>, the ultra-cheap pass cost the state too much for it to be extended.</p><p>There’s a <a href="https://www.euronews.com/travel/2023/05/29/all-prices-will-have-to-be-increased-germanys-49-ticket-might-not-be-so-cheap-for-much-lon"><strong>question mark</strong></a> over how long this year’s €49 pass will last, with transport bosses warning in May that it may be unsustainable too.</p><p>But Wissing sounds a hopeful note. The more subscribers there are, the cheaper the Deutschlandticket will be in the long term.</p><p>“That’s why we have to make sure that as many people as possible use the ticket permanently.”</p><p><em>Here’s how Germany’s monthly €49 nationwide public transport ticket <a href="https://www.euronews.com/travel/2023/06/13/deutschlandticket-germany-launches-49-per-month-ticket-for-trains-buses-and-trams"><strong>works</strong></a>, and where it is valid.</em></p></div></div>
