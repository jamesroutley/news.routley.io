<p>As the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/more-journalists-banned-by-twitter-how-to-find-them-on-mastodon/">Twitter exodus
continues</a>,
there’s been a lot of talk on Mastodon about wanting to boost posts while
adding a comment above them, like Twitter’s “quote tweet” feature.</p>

<p>Many people both supportive and fearful of adding quote toots are, in
my view, overlooking a basic fact. Mastodon posts are just web pages,
and <em>a quote toot is just a link.</em></p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>The quote toot was originally
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/99662106175542726">rejected</a> as too
much of an abuse vector by the lead developer of the main Mastodon
project. But he now <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-man-behind-mastodon-eugen-rochko-built-it-for-this-moment/">feels less
strongly</a>
about it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the feature has been widely championed for its value to
Black Twitter (<a href="https://privacy.thenexus.today/black-twitter-quoting-and-white-toxicity-on-mastodon/">good roundup of perspectives
here</a>).
Other fediverse software compatible with Mastodon is adding some form
of quote toot support, including the new iOS app
<a href="https://mastodon.social/@MonaApp/109591728760414123">Mona</a> and the
<a href="https://friend.camp/@darius/109598497992347259">Hometown fork</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-quote-toot">What’s a quote toot?</h2>

<p>Every Mastodon post is a web page with a URL. You can copy-paste that
URL into the compose box after your comment and toot away. So, what
would have to change about the default Mastodon experience<sup id="fnref:default" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:default">1</a></sup>
to make this the same as a quote tweet on Twitter?</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Rich preview.</em> The link preview for a Mastodon post is very
uninformative. It only shows the post author’s name and the name of
their server. For parity, the preview would have to include the
author’s profile pic, the text of the post (possibly abbreviated if
long), and thumbnails of any attached images or videos.</li>
  <li><em>Interactable.</em> Clicking through to the original post should allow
you to reply to it, favorite or boost it, or follow the author.
Currently, Mastodon’s official web client instead opens the post in
a new tab on the original server, which means that if you’re not on
that same server, it’s difficult to interact.</li>
  <li><em>Notifies the original poster.</em> If you link to someone’s post, they
won’t receive a notification, unless you also @-mention them.</li>
  <li><em>Button next to every post to do it.</em> Linking requires clicking
the three-dots button, selecting “Copy link to post,” going to the
compose box, and pasting. On Twitter, the retweet button and then
“Quote Tweet” does this more conveniently, encouraging the
behavior.</li>
  <li><em>Built-in search for all links to a post.</em> On Twitter, under any
post that has been quote tweeted, there is a link to list out all
the quote tweets—i.e., to automatically search for all the tweets
that link to that tweet.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, when we say we want quote toots, which of these features are
important? And how does it make sense to implement them?</p>

<h2 id="my-take-make-links-work-better">My take: Make links work better…</h2>

<p>First, Mastodon and its clients should absolutely fix the <em>bad
previews</em>. Not just for this use case, but in general. Link previews
look crummy across the board: if I link to a blog post that has an
image attached to it, Mastodon displays the image smaller than Twitter
or Facebook does, and it doesn’t show my post’s subtitle. Mastodon
should also generate better preview cards for its own posts—to make
them look better when linked on Mastodon and also when shared to
proprietary social networks and messaging apps. This is just about
making links work better.</p>

<p>Second, of course links within Mastodon to Mastodon posts should open
inline and be <em>interactable</em>. The current behavior actually makes
linking from Mastodon to Mastodon less functional than linking from
Mastodon to Twitter. No sense in that.</p>

<h2 id="but-dont-copy-everything">…but don’t copy everything</h2>

<p>On the other hand, it’s <em>good</em> that you can link to things on the
internet without <em>notifying the publisher</em>, whether the content is on
Mastodon or not. Such a link could be abusive, but it could also be a
way of warning someone about an abuser. Linking to a post—also known
as quote tooting it—shouldn’t notify the original poster unless you
opt into that by tagging them.</p>

<p>(There is actually a blog analogy for this notification:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pingback">pingbacks</a>! In the heyday of
personal blogs, when another blog mentioned yours, their software
might notify your blog, which might then automatically show the
pingback at the bottom of your post. Pingbacks seem to have faded away
as people moved away from personal blogs onto Twitter and Facebook and
Medium and the abuse of pingbacks for spam and DoS attacks began to
outweigh any benefits. In any event, they were always an opt-in
feature.)</p>

<p>I also <em>don’t</em> want a button next to every post that automatically
cues up a new post that links to that one (i.e., a <em>quote toot
button</em>). Linking should be allowed, but it should be easier to just
reply. As I <a href="https://scott.mn/2022/10/29/twitter_features_mastodon_is_better_without/">previously
wrote</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>it was, in fact, a blessing that Mastodon’s design was steering me
towards talking to people rather than pointing at them. When you
quote, you branch the conversation to talk about someone, and it’s
not always clear if the original poster is welcome to participate in
the new branch. You’re more likely to exchange ideas and learn
something by replying. [Linking manually] adds enough friction to
avoid becoming the default interaction mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, this particular feature is trivial for client apps to add,
and some will. But if it becomes widespread, I predict it will lower
the quality of conversations on the fediverse.</p>

<p>Lastly, posts should absolutely not have a list of all the posts that
have linked to them (i.e., a <em>list of quote toots</em>), attached to the
post. It’s hard enough already to prevent snotty replies from showing
up. Please don’t put potentially obnoxious mentions under my posts as
well. (On that note, “Hide reply” is one Twitter feature that Mastodon
really should copy.)</p>

<h2 id="permission-to-link">Permission to link</h2>

<p>To mitigate the potential abuse vector of quote toots, a compromise
idea that’s been proposed is maybe you could only allow certain
posts to be quote tooted, or only allow people you follow to quote
toot you.</p>

<p>But this is really saying we would require permission to link to a
public web page.</p>

<p>That’s not how the web works or has ever worked. And I don’t think
that should change. It would have a chilling effect on online speech
if it became a norm that linking to a public web page requires
permission.</p>

<p>If you don’t want people to link to a web page, require
authentication. On Mastodon that means a followers-only post.</p>

<h2 id="quote-toots-arent-links">Quote toots aren’t links?</h2>

<p>Throughout this blog post, I’ve claimed a quote toot is just a link.
The “quote” part of the name, inherited from Twitter, has misled us.
Treating them as links clarifies our thinking, whether you agree with
my conclusions or not.</p>

<p>It’s entirely possible for a Mastodon server implementation to treat a
“quote toot” as something different from a “toot that happens to
contain a link,” and for clients to rely on this distinction to render
links differently.<sup id="fnref:treehouse" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:treehouse">2</a></sup></p>

<p>But this doesn’t solve any fundamental issue, and will
confuse users, violating their expectations.</p>

<p>Suppose I’ve disabled quote toots for one of my posts. No one can
<em>quote toot</em> it. But someone <em>links</em> to it with a rude comment or
disagreement. As an average user, I’m likely to be surprised and
dismayed when I find out that happened. Didn’t I turn that off? How
can they do that?</p>

<p>And then you, the Mastodon admin or developer, can try to explain to
me, “No no no, <em>quote toots</em> and <em>links</em> are two completely separate
things!” But what I walk away with is: “Mastodon is too complicated,
and its privacy settings can’t be trusted.” The result: there’s likely
to be strong user pressure to, if someone disables quote toots, also
ban linking to that post at all.</p>

<p>Conversely, if I paste the URL to another post into my post, and it
shows up with a crappy <em>link</em> preview, instead of displaying as a nice
<em>quote toot</em>, I’m gonna be frustrated. How do I get it to look pretty
and work right like other people’s? Now again Mastodon has a usability
issue.</p>

<p>The natural solution is for clients to detect when a link to a
Mastodon post<sup id="fnref:technicalstatus" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:technicalstatus">3</a></sup> is being posted, and automagically
upgrade that from a link to a quote toot. But then if we’re not
careful, and if we have the ability to disable quote toots, we’ve
sleepwalked into creating a total linking ban again.<sup id="fnref:confusing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:confusing">4</a></sup></p>

<p>They’re links. There’s no getting around the fact that this thing
Twitter calls a “quote tweet” is just a link to a web page, and always
was, and that didn’t change because one day Twitter decided to give
them nicer previews, a dedicated button, and a dedicated search link.</p>
