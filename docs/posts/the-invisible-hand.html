<p>I have this ongoing struggle where I want to change the name of my project, but I don’t know what to change it for. Every alternative I came up is failing me in subtle or not so subtle ways.</p>
<p>Today I was talking with a friend for hours about my project.</p>
<p>And it was an insightful conversation that led me to consider it in many different directions and point of view.</p>
<p>I’ve been refering more and more to this project as some version or another of « making tangible the invisible hand of the market », casting its shadow onto something, listening to it, touching it… tasting it ?</p>
<p>I want to write something about this, something lengthier. I have a very long term project keeping me busy at the moment though. We will see.</p>
<p>I kinda want and like to work in private for now …</p>
