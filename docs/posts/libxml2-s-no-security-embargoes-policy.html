    <h1>Libxml2&#39;s &#34;no security embargoes&#34; policy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/#libxml2">Libxml2</a>, an
XML parser and toolkit, is an almost perfect example of the successes
and failures of the open-source movement. In the 25 years since its
first release, it has been widely adopted by open-source projects, for
use in commercial software, and for government use. It also
illustrates that while many organizations love using open-source software,
far fewer have yet to see value in helping to sustain it. That has led
libxml2&#39;s current maintainer to reject security embargoes and sparked
a discussion about maintenance terms for free and open-source
projects.</p>

<h4>A short libxml2 history</h4>

<p>The original <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000303144017/http://www.xmlsoft.org/xml.html">libxml</a>,
also known as gnome-xml, was written by Daniel Veillard for the GNOME
project. He also developed its successor, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040810043236/http://www.xmlsoft.org/xml.html">libxml2</a>,
which was released in early 2000 under the MIT license, even though
GNOME applications tended to be under the GPLv2.</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, Veillard seemed eager to have others adopt
libxml2 outside the GNOME project. It was originally hosted on its own
site rather than on GNOME infrastructure. Libxml2 is written in C, but
had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040810145537/http://xmlsoft.org/python.html">language
bindings</a> for C++, Java, Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, and
more. The landing page listed a slew of standards implemented by
libxml2, as well as the variety of operating systems that it
supported, and boasted that it &#34;<q>passed all 1800+ tests from the
OASIS XML Tests Suite</q>&#34;. The &#34;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040807054916/http://xmlsoft.org/bugs.html">reporting
bugs and getting help</a>&#34; page gave extensive guidance on how to
report bugs, and also noted that Veillard would attend to bugs or
missing features &#34;<q>in a timely fashion</q>&#34;. The page, captured by
the Internet Archive in 2004, makes no mention of handling security
reports differently than bug reports—but those were simpler
times.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>One can see why organizations felt comfortable, and even encouraged, to
adopt libxml2 for their software. Why reinvent the extremely
complicated wheel when someone else has not only done it but also
bragged about their wheel&#39;s suitability for purpose and given it a
permissive license to boot?</p>

<p>By the late 2000s, the project had matured, and the pace of
releases slowed accordingly. Veillard continued to maintain the
project, but skimming through the <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/index.html">GNOME xml
mailing list</a> shows that his attention was largely elsewhere. Nick
Wellnhofer began to make regular contributions to the project around
2013, and by 2017 he was doing a great deal of work on the project,
eventually doing most of the work on releases—though Veillard
was still officially sending them out. He was also making similar
contributions to a related project, <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxslt/#libxslt">libxslt</a>,
which is a processor for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT">Extensible Stylesheet
Language Transformations</a> (XSLT) which are used for transforming
XML documents into other XML documents or into HTML, plain text,
etc.</p>

<h4>I want my libxml2</h4>

<p>In April 2021, Stefan Behnel <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2021-April/msg00000.html">complained</a>
that it had been almost 18 months since the last libxml2
release. &#34;<q>There have been a lot of fixes during that time, so, may
I kindly ask what&#39;s hindering a new release?</q>&#34; Veillard <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2021-April/msg00001.html">replied</a>
that the reason was that he was too busy with work, and there was
&#34;<q>something I would need to get in before a release</q>&#34;. That
something seems to be a security fix for <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/cve-2021-3541">CVE-2021-3541</a>,
a flaw in libxml2 that could lead to a denial of service. The release
of libxml2 <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2021-May/msg00000.html">2.9.11</a>,
which fixed the CVE, and <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2021-May/msg00003.html">2.9.12</a>,
seem to have been the last contributions from Veillard to the project.</p>

<p>Wellnhofer had become the de facto maintainer of libxml2 and
libxslt as Veillard was fading away from them, but he temporarily <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2021-July/msg00000.html">stepped
down</a> in July 2021. He had been able to fund his work through
Chrome bug bounties and other Google programs, but: &#34;<q>returns from
security research are diminishing quickly and I see no way to obtain a
minimal level of funding anymore</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Veillard <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2021-July/msg00005.html">thanked</a>
Wellnhofer for his work, and said he was not sure that he would be
able to ensure the same level of care for the projects on his own:
&#34;<q>that&#39;s obvious for anybody monitoring those lists lately</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>In January 2022, Wellnhofer <a href="https://mail.gnome.org/archives/xml/2022-January/msg00001.html">announced</a>
that he was able to resume maintenance of libxml2 and libxslt through
2022, thanks to a donation from Google. He planned to move the
projects to GNOME&#39;s infrastructure and resume releases, plus set up an
official way to sponsor libxml2 development. Ultimately, he chose <a href="https://opencollective.com/libxml2">Open Source
Collective</a> as a fiscal host. (LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/964402/">covered</a> Open Source
Collective in 2024.) To date, it appears that the project has received the
immense sum of $11,000, most of which was in the form of a $10,000 donation from
Google, which appears to be the funding Wellnhofer received for
maintenance of libxml2 through 2022.</p>

<h4>Irresponsible behavior</h4>

<p>Fast-forwarding to 2025, Wellnhofer opened <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/913">an
issue</a> on May 8, in the libxml2 GitLab repository to announce a new security
policy for the project. He said that he was spending several hours
each week dealing with security issues, and that was unsustainable for
an unpaid volunteer.</p>

<p>As an example of what Wellnhofer was faced with, and a hint as to
what may have been the final straw, there are currently
four bugs marked with the <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/?label_name=1.%20Security">security</a>
label in the libxml2 issue tracker. Three of those were opened on
May 7 by Nikita Sveshnikov, a security researcher who works for a
company called Positive Technologies. One of the issues is a <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/905">report</a>
about a null-pointer deference that could lead to a denial of
service. It includes a <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/905#note_2433271">request</a>
for Wellnhofer to provide a CVE number for the vulnerability and provide
information about an expected patch date. Note that neither libxml2
nor GNOME are CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs).</p>

<p>One can debate whether the vulnerabilities reported by Sveshnikov
and other researchers have much value. Wellnhofer <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/905#note_2433293">argues</a>
he has fixed about 100 similar bugs and does not consider that class
of bugs to be security-critical. Even if it is a valid security flaw,
it is clear why it might rankle a maintainer. The report is not coming
from a user of the project, and it comes with no attempt at a patch to
fix the vulnerability. It is another demand on an unpaid maintainer&#39;s
time so that, apparently, a security research company can <a href="https://global.ptsecurity.com/about/news">brag about the
discovery</a> to promote its services.</p>

<p>If Wellnhofer follows the script expected of a maintainer, he will
spend hours fixing the bugs, corresponding with the researcher, and
releasing a new version of libxml2. Sveshnikov and Positive
Technologies will put another notch in their CVE belts, but what does
Wellnhofer get out of the arrangement? Extra work, an unwanted CVE,
and negligible real-world benefit for users of libxml2.</p>

<p>So, rather than honoring embargoes and dealing with deadlines for
security fixes, Wellnhofer would rather treat security issues like any
other bug; the issues would be made public as soon as they were
reported and fixed whenever maintainers had time. Wellnhofer also
announced that he was stepping down as the libxslt maintainer and said
it was unlikely that it would ever be maintained again. It was even
more unlikely, he said, with security researchers &#34;<q>breathing down
the necks of volunteers.</q>&#34;</p>

<p>Treating security flaws as regular bugs might make some downstream
users nervous, but Wellnhofer hopes it will encourage more contributions:</p>

<blockquote>
The more I think about it, the more I realize that this is the only
way forward. I&#39;ve been doing this long enough to know that most of the
secrecy around security issues is just theater. All the &#34;best
practices&#34; like OpenSSF Scorecards are just an attempt by big tech
companies to guilt trip OSS maintainers and make them work for
free.
</blockquote>

<p>GNOME contributor Michael Catanzaro <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/913#note_2436468">worried</a>
that security flaws would be exploited in the wild if they
were treated like regular bugs, and suggested alternate strategies for
Wellnhofer if he was burning out. He agreed that &#34;<q>wealthy
corporations</q>&#34; with a stake in libxml2 security issues should help
by becoming maintainers. If not, &#34;<q>then the consequence is security
issues will surely reach the disclosure deadline (whatever it is set
to) and become public before they are fixed</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Wellnhofer was not interested in finding ways to put a band-aid
on the problem; <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libxml2/-/issues/913#note_2439345">he
said</a> that it would be better for the health of the project if
companies stopped using it altogether:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The point is that libxml2 never had the quality to be used in
mainstream browsers or operating systems to begin with. It all started
when Apple made libxml2 a core component of all their OSes. Then
Google followed suit and now even Microsoft is using libxml2 in their
OS outside of Edge. This should have never happened. Originally it was
kind of a growth hack, but now these companies make billions of
profits and refuse to pay back their technical debt, either by
switching to better solutions, developing their own or by trying to
improve libxml2.</p>

<p>The behavior of these companies is irresponsible. Even if they
claim otherwise, they don&#39;t care about the security and privacy of
their users. They only try to fix symptoms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He added that he would love to mentor new maintainers for libxml2,
&#34;<q>but there simply aren&#39;t any candidates</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>The viewpoint expressed by Wellnhofer&#39;s is understandable, though
one might argue about the assertion that libxml2 was not of sufficient
quality for mainstream use. It was certainly promoted on the project
web site as a capable and portable toolkit for the purpose of parsing
XML. Open-source proponents spent much of the late 1990s and early
2000s trying to entice companies to trust the quality of projects like
libxml2, so it is hard to blame those companies now for believing it
was suitable for mainstream use at the time.</p>

<p>However, Wellnhofer&#39;s point that these companies have not looked to
improve or care for libxml2 in the intervening years is entirely
valid. It seems to be a case of &#34;out of sight, out of mind&#34;; as long
as there are no known CVEs plaguing the many open-source libraries
that these applications depend on, nobody at Apple, Google, Microsoft,
or any of the other companies, seem to care much about the upkeep of
these projects. When a vulnerability is found, the maintainer is
seemingly expected to spring into action out of a sense of
responsibility to the larger ecosystem.</p>

<h4>Safe to say no</h4>

<p>Wellnhofer&#39;s arguments about corporate behavior have struck a chord
with several people in the open-source community. Ariadne Conill,
a long-time open-source contributor, <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@ariadne/114714421974540313">observed</a>
that corporations using open source had responded with &#34;<q>regulatory
capture of the commons</q>&#34; instead of contributing to the software
they depend on.</p>

<p>She <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@ariadne/114714478204794129">suggested</a>
that maintainers lacked the &#34;<q>psychological safety</q>&#34; to easily
say no. They <em>can</em> say no to corporate requests; doing
so, however, <a href="https://social.treehouse.systems/@ariadne/114714591541583306">means</a>
weighing that &#34;<q>the cost of doing so may negatively impact the project&#39;s ability
to meet its end goal</q>&#34;. In that light, maintainers may opt to
concede to requests for free labor rather than risking the
unknown consequences.</p>

<p>In response to Wellnhofer&#39;s change in security policy for libxml2,
Mike Hoye <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mhoye/114705202798599910">proposed</a>
that projects adopt public maintenance terms that would indicate
&#34;<q>access to code is no promise of access to people</q>&#34;. The terms
for a project would be included as a <tt><a href="https://github.com/mhoye/maintenance-terms/blob/main/MAINTENANCE-TERMS.md">MAINTENANCE-TERMS.md</a></tt>
file in the top-level directory, similar to the <tt>README.md</tt> and
<tt>CONTRIBUTING.md</tt> files included with many projects these
days. The <a href="https://github.com/mhoye/maintenance-terms">sample
maintenance terms</a> that Hoye provided state that the software is
provided as-is and disclaim any promises, including response time,
disclosure schedules, or any &#34;<q>non-contractual obligations or
conventions, regardless of their presumed urgency or
severity</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Hoye <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mhoye/114705249870608541">said</a> that
the point of the maintenance terms is to deliberately build a culture
of social permission where maintainers feel safe saying
&#34;no&#34;. Otherwise, he <a href="https://mastodon.social/@mhoye/114705284226501374">said</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
Someday, somebody&#39;s going to come to you and say, I&#39;m from Apple, I&#39;m
from Amazon, I&#39;m from Project Zero and you need to drop everything
because your project is the new heartbleed or Log4j or who knows what
and the world is falling over and if that psychological offramp isn&#39;t
there, if you haven&#39;t laid out clearly what PROVIDED AS-IS means and
how you&#39;re going to act about it ahead of time, saying &#34;I&#39;ll be at my
kid&#39;s recital&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m on vacation&#34; or just &#34;no&#34; is extremely
difficult.
</blockquote>

<p>Chris Siebenmann <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/tech/OpenSourceTwoWorlds">said</a>
that he thinks that Wellnhofer&#39;s rejection of security embargoes is
&#34;<q>an early sign of more of this to come, as more open source
maintainers revolt</q>&#34;. The current situation, Siebenmann said, is
increasingly bad for the maintainers involved and is not
sustainable. He now draws a sharp distinction between the corporate
use of open-source software versus independent projects, such as
Debian or the BSDs, run by volunteers; he expects that others will be
doing the same in the future.</p>

<p>Maintainers may not want to say no to other volunteers. But,
Siebenmann said, if a corporation shows up with a security issue, they
can point to the maintenance <span>terms—because</span> corporations are not using
open source as part of a cooperative venture and are not people
&#34;<q>even if they employ people who make &#39;people open source&#39;
noises</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Wellnhofer&#39;s stance and Hoye&#39;s idea seem to be resonating with
other maintainers who have strong feelings about corporate open-source
behavior. Whether open-source maintainers adopt
<tt>MAINTENANCE-TERMS.md</tt> files as a common practice is yet to be
seen. The increasing frequency of conversations about funding open
source and whether corporations are doing their share does suggest
that something needs to change soon if open source is to be
sustainable and not just a sucker&#39;s game for maintainers.</p></div></div>
