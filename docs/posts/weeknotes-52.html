<li>hey! it&#39;s time for weeknotes!</li>
<li>it&#39;s been a whole year of weeks!!!! no idea how long it&#39;s been in real time, but it&#39;s been great. here&#39;s to 104 weeknotes, the future and the world!</li>
<li>i moved city so you&#39;re getting flustered, tired, on the edge of autistic shutdown olu, but we&#39;re here we&#39;re queer, and we&#39;ll get used to it. or rather it gets better lol.</li>
<li>been listening to my playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvgip4vmTtgnN2-OXd6erfLcIqE0kIgj-">aural diazepam</a> a lot lol. gotta take the edge off somehow!</li>
<li>really looking forward to putting down roots and building some local community here. it&#39;s a much smaller city. it feels nice here already. there was a small incident at the station, but it was the day of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/sep/15/who-were-the-key-figures-at-the-unite-the-kingdom-rally-in-london">big horrible march</a> so i feel less afraid with perspective!</li>
<li>do i want to change all the spotlights in my room to hue or other smart lights? there&#39;s six, that feels like a lot of bulbs. also, i&#39;ve somehow never changed a GU10 style bulb? new adventures! i&#39;m pretty pro big light as a person, i draw the line at fluorescent lights and spotlights.</li>
<li>started re-reading unfuck your habitat. i forgot what was even in the book, i read it so long ago.</li>
<li>one use case for <a href="https://olu.online/ai">ai</a> for me would be a tie-break; i have used it like that in the past to prioritise or order tasks so i don&#39;t get defeated by trying to decide what to do for 3 hours, to only end up doing nothing... i think a coin flip or <a href="https://wheelofnames.com/">spinning the wheel</a> only goes so far for me, i bug my friends asking what to do first a lot!</li>
<li>trying to write a script for youtube slowly, and trying to write a blog post for r of <a href="https://olu.online/alphabet-superset">alphabet superset</a>. i am enjoying writing a lot at the minute, even if they&#39;re not the most productive sessions of my life. hopefully the speed will come.</li>
<li>been eating tortellini, fried chicken and pancakes, and so many other nice brunchy breakfasts. i&#39;ve been drinking tap water and many a latte.</li>
<li>how are you? well i hope?</li>
<li>see you next week ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
