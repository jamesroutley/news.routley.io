                        Introduction At the time of writing this post, we are in the process of releasing pandas 2.0. The project has a large number of users, and it&#39;s used in production quite widely by personal and corporate users. This large use based forces us to be...

                        This week we organized a round table with people involved in the management of data projects. Mostly data science. The idea came after the Executives at PyData session organized earlier this year. And discussions with few people on the challenges...

                        Some exciting news. After some years of organizing sprints, and maintaining open source, I&#39;ve been thinking on a more efficient workflow for projects with high volume of activity, like pandas. An exaggerated example would be that I want to create...

                        While git is surely one of my favorite tools, and increases my productivity in a sometimes unbelivable way (like when working on 3 or 5 features at the same time), some times there are operations that can be a bit tricky. There are plenty of git...
