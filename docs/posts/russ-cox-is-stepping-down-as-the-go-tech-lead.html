    <p>Hi Russ,</p>
    <p>Thanks for all of your work and dedication. Looking back at the
      biggest changes and milestones in the project in the past ten
      years, like modules and generics, it&#39;s clear that you played a key
      part in ensuring their long-term success.</p>
    <p>I&#39;ve only met Austin and Cherry a couple of times but I
      definitely agree that they are great choices going forward.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy your well deserved time as an individual
      contributor - I think we&#39;re all looking forward to what you&#39;ll be
      able to contribute with the new role.</p>
    <p>Speaking of the transition and its details - would this be a good
      opportunity to restart the <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43930" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://github.com/golang/go/issues/43930&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1722647274208000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2c_fR-pyTX7eJiwLgKqfrt">compiler and
        runtime meeting notes thread</a>, which I always found pretty
      useful to skim through? I&#39;d also love to see the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/6W8rGAUKDaQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/6W8rGAUKDaQ&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1722647274208000&amp;usg=AOvVaw3zXI8WmzBbUDfeuzJKSfaO">compiler
        and runtime office hours calls</a> come back :)</p>
    <p>Rob Findley and the rest of the tools folks already do a great
      job at being transparent with the community via Slack and our <a href="https://go.dev/wiki/golang-tools" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-US&amp;q=https://go.dev/wiki/golang-tools&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1722647274208000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0OgaLS1E5XIh_i_b9opblq">regular golang-tools
        calls</a> - the runtime and compiler planning and decision
      making is a little opaque in comparison at the moment. </p>
    <p>Thanks again, and stick around!<br/>

issue tracker to help all of you work more productively. I am hopeful that
work on Oscar will uncover ways to help open source maintainers that will
be adopted by other projects, just like some of Go’s best ideas have been
adopted by other projects. At the highest level, my goals for Oscar are to
build something useful, learn something new, and chart a path for other
projects. These are the same broad goals I’ve always had for our work on
Go, so in that sense Oscar feels like a natural continuation.

I am incredibly proud of the work we have all accomplished together, and I
am confident in the leaders both on the Go team at Google and in the Go
community. You are all doing remarkable work, and I know you will continue
to do that.

The exact details of this transition are yet to be decided. Part of the
point of this mail is to ensure that we can discuss those details publicly.
Austin and I are both committed to making the change seem like a non-event
except for the Go project becoming stronger and better. Again, I’m not
leaving Go and will still be around and participating as an individual
contributor.

Please always feel free to continue to reach out whenever you need
anything. And my thanks and congratulations to Austin and Cherry for
stepping into their new roles.


Best,
Russ
