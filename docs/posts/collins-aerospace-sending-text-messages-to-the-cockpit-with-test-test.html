    <h1>Collins Aerospace: Sending text messages to the cockpit with test:test</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Informed parties:</strong> RTX Corporation and Department of Defense Cyber Crime Center (on September 21, 2025)</p>
<p>Using the credentials test:test, it was possible to log in at the ARINC OpCenter Message Browser (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250306223702/https://data.ntsb.gov/Docket/Document/docBLOB?ID=40312110&amp;FileExtension=.PDF&amp;FileName=Operations%202V%20-%20ACARS%20Report-Master.PDF">Screenshot</a>) as U.S. Navy Fleet Logistics Support Wing.</p>
<p>Via this web service, text messages can be sent to the cockpit. For  obvious reasons, we did not try that. Sent messages could be viewed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, RTX did not respond to our vulnerability report. The account was disabled.</p></div></div>
