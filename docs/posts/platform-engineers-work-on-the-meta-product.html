    <h1>platform engineers work on the meta-product</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, September 23, 2024</em></p><p>In <a href="https://bytes.zone/posts/what-is-platform-engineering/">what is platform engineering?</a>, I gave this definition:</p><blockquote><p>Platform engineering, as a discipline, takes a coherent approach to improving an engineering organization&#39;s output in ways that the rest of the business can see and understand.</p></blockquote><p>I&#39;ve had some thoughts and discussions since then, though, and I think that definition needs revising. Specifically, I tried to be very clear in the last post that I didn&#39;t think platform engineering could/should be gatekept. Problem is, that previous definition has some scoping issues—mostly around vagueness—that could work against that goal.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>For one thing, it gives a bad-faith interpretation some gotchas: you could be doing the work of platform engineering, but have someone argue that your approach is not &#34;coherent&#34; or that the business cannot see and understand your work. I gave examples in the last post, but that feels like a bad substitute for the definition itself being clearer.</p><p>For another, the language here is too broad: there are differences between SRE, devops, and platform engineering, but this definition does not give you the tools to distinguish between them. To be fair, I think this is minor; this definition gives enough information to get started, or to explain what you&#39;re doing to someone outside your immediate work. But I also think definitions should allow for clear distinctions, and this one doesn&#39;t.</p><p>Fortunately, I think I see a way around all these problems in two steps. First: who is a platform engineer?</p><blockquote><p>A platform engineer is someone who does the work of platform engineering.</p></blockquote><p>If you make art, you&#39;re an artist. If you make music, you&#39;re a musician. If you do the work of platform engineering, you&#39;re a platform engineer. That definition resists gatekeeping, which I like. But what is the work?</p><blockquote><p>Platform engineers work on the internal product that other teams use to make the customer-facing product.</p></blockquote><p>Or more succinctly:</p><blockquote><p>Platform engineers work on the meta-product.</p></blockquote><p>I like a couple things about this. First, this clearly includes the things we care about: CI/CD, developer experience, tooling, moving observability tools to where developers can see and use them, etc. If it’s part of the internal product, then it&#39;s in scope.</p><p>Second, it distinguishes between the work of platform engineering and SREs or devops. For example, when I&#39;ve worked in devops or SRE roles, I&#39;ve cared a lot about what applications are running where, what kind of traffic loads we&#39;re expecting, or how much we&#39;re spending to deliver the product. These are all customer-facing concerns, and might not be in scope for platform engineering. The meta-product here would be working on things like adopting Terraform or Kubernetes, which automates a lot of that work and allows teams to ship the product more efficiently.</p><p>Now, someone might say &#34;ah, but SREs care a lot about automation! That&#39;s the meta-product and actually a big part of the gig!&#34; Yes, good, that&#39;s correct! But check out the new definition: are they working on the meta-product? Yes? Then they&#39;re doing platform engineering in addition to SREing. That&#39;s fine; I acknowledge the overlap here. Part of the utility of this definition is that it allows us to recognize this overlap, while still making a distinction. People hired into platform engineering roles may (and probably will) work with SREs on cloud automation projects, but that&#39;s not their only thing.</p><p>Let&#39;s examine this from the dev side as well: at a small company, you probably don&#39;t have someone specifically doing platform engineering as their whole role (for, say, more than 50% of their time.) But you still need a platform: gotta set up CI and a deployment target, at minimum. Congratulations, you&#39;re doing platform engineering! Nobody can tell you you’re not.</p><p>Finally, in the platform engineering role itself, this serves as a good charter for an individual or team. Where there’s overlap, you can share the load. Where there’s not, it’s clearly your responsibility.</p><p>So there you have it: a better definition. This still isn’t perfect, but I think it’s a big improvement over the last one.</p></article></div>
