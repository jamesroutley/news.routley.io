    <h1>AI-driven thermal cameras used to obtain passwords</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content_885914">


<p>Computer security experts have developed a system capable of guessing computer and smartphone usersâ€™ passwords in seconds by analysing the traces of heat their fingertips leave on keyboards and screens.</p>
<p>The research was supported by funding from the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE Award 65040), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC grant number EP/V008870/1), and the PETRAS National Centre of Excellence for IoT Systems Cybersecurity (Project PT.HEAT) which is also funded by the EPSRC (EP/S035362/1), as well as by a studentship sponsored by Taif University and the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia Cultural Bureau in London.</p>
