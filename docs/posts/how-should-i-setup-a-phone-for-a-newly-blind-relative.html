    <h1>Ask HN: How should I setup a phone for a newly blind relative?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am home for the holidays and my grandfather is newly blind. He&#39;s never learned braille or anything else and I believe it can be a relatively isolating experience. While I&#39;m in town for the holidays, I would love to help him get back into things like podcasts, audio books and WhatsApp. Does anyone have recommendations for how to help set this up?</p><p>He currently has an iPhone but if android phones are superior for blind users, I would happily help him switch.</p></div></div></div>
