    <p>My name is <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi">Eric Migicovsky</a> and I love small phones. It‚Äôs weird because I am 6‚Äô6‚Äù but I never enjoyed using a large phone. I loved the Sony Xperia Compact series. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/16/9549247/sony-xperia-z5-review-compact-android">RIP</a>...</p>
    <h3>I love small phones because they</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>fits nicely in pocket</li>
    <li>are much lighter</li>
    <li>are easy to use one-handed without dropping</li>
    <li>won&#39;t fall out of my pocket while bicycling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And of course, some people with smaller hands hate how big phones feel!</p>
    <p>The drawbacks of a small phone (smaller screen, smaller battery) are fundamentally less of an issue than the size, for me at least. These trade-offs are certainly not for everyone, so if you are a die-hard big phone person you might as well stop reading üòÇ</p>
    <h3>Why write this?</h3>
    <p>It&#39;s increasingly clear that a small premium phone is not on any OEM roadmap. So I‚Äôve decided to take matters into my own hands. My goal here is to rally other fans of small phones together and put pressure on Google/Samsung/anyone to consider making a small phone.</p>
    <p>If you want a small premium Android phone, this may be your last chance (ever?) to help bring back the phone category that we love.</p>
