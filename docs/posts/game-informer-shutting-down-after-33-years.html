    <h1>Game Informer shutting down after 33 years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Game Informer</em>, one of the last remaining gaming magazines,<em> </em>is shutting down after 33 years, the GameStop-owned publication <a href="https://x.com/gameinformer/status/1819399257071214854">announced on Friday</a>. The magazine’s entire staff is being laid off, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-informer-gamestop-meme-stock-gme-last-issue-1851611973"><em>Kotaku</em> reports</a>.</p><p>In its statement posted to X, the publication didn’t give a reason for the shutdown. GameStop didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Last year, GameStop CEO and chairman Ryan Cohen told staff that “every expense at the company must be scrutinized under a microscope and all waste eliminated,” according to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-meme-stock-gme-ryan-cohen-ceo-email-layoffs-1850884730">an email obtained by <em>Kotaku</em></a>. </p><p>In March, <em>Game Informer</em> introduced out a way to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-now-offering-standalone-subscriptions/1100-6522173/">subscribe to the magazine directly</a> — previously, you could only get the magazine by buying issues on their own or through a GameStop Pro subscription. “Hard times, layoffs, cancellations, and closures have impacted thousands of game developers and publishers, as well as other outlets like us that celebrate games,” editor-in-chief Matt Miller wrote <em>Game Informer’s</em> blog post about that announcement. (After we first published this article, the link to the post directed to <em>Game Informer’s</em> shutdown message.) “We haven’t been immune to that hardship.”</p><p>Here is the full shutdown statement from <em>Game Informer</em>’s X account and <em>Game Informer</em>’s <a href="https://subscription.gameinformer.com">subscription page</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p><strong>The Final Level: Farewell from Game Informer</strong></p><p>After 33 thrilling years of bringing you the latest news, reviews, and insights from the ever-evolving world of gaming, it is with a heavy heart that we announce the closure of Game Informer. </p><p>From the early days of pixelated adventures to today’s immersive virtual realms, we’ve been honored to share this incredible journey with you, our loyal readers. While our presses may stop, the passion for gaming that we’ve cultivated together will continue to live on. </p><p>Thank you for being part of our epic quest, and may your own gaming adventures never end.</p></blockquote></div><p><em><strong>Update, August 2nd</strong>: A post from </em>Game Informer’s<em> editor-in-chief about its subscription offering is no longer viewable.</em></p></div></div>
