              <p>Congrats on the launch! Penpot has surely come a long way. The team has done amazing work! I’m eager to really start using it, but I still feel like there’s one feature that’s preventing me from doing so. Components really need states/variants. I know that you have a story for that in the Components 2.0 epic (<a href="https://tree.taiga.io/project/penpot/us/2871" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Taiga</a>), I just hope that it’s prioritized for implementation sooner than later.</p>
<p>Thank you all for all your hard work.</p>

              <p>Well, I take back what I said about component states/variants. It looks like your component system is quite unique in how it deals with variants. After watching this video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOGu1ke9fM4" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOGu1ke9fM4</a>), I was curious to see if what I was seeing in that tutorial, was really the case so I decided to test something.</p>
<p>After taking a deeper dive into the component system, it seems that variants are possible. It’s a new way of thinking about components states/variants. Main components can be created from instances and then those new main components can actually inherit from the instance’s parent main component. So component inheritance can be multi-tiered, which is pretty interesting and useful as a solution for component variants. Now, in light of this, the only thing that is still needed is a some kind of hover solution for prototyping <em>(unless it’s there and I’m missing it?)</em>.</p>
