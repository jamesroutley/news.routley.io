            <p>We built All Quiet to make your incident escalation as
                    soothing as yoga at the beach. Or a margarita at the beach. Whatever soothes
                    you.

            <h2>Our motivation</h2>
            <div><p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Mads Quist, the founder of All Quiet. Working as an engineering manager myself, I realized that the market missed the appropriate incident escalation platform which would meet my team&#39;s requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dedicated collaboration channel</li>
                    <li>A channel with high attention without being too loud</li>
                    <li>Instant feedback on an incident&#39;s status</li>
                    <li>Escalation policies</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
