    <h1>The Fight to Hold Pornhub Accountable</h1>

Rachel lived with her mother, stepfather, and siblings in a midsize town in the United Kingdom. She had just returned home from a party and was in her bedroom. “I had a really unstable home life, and I didn’t have good support around me,” Rachel told me recently, while sitting on her bed in a fluffy white bathrobe. “I was a complete mess, I didn’t trust anyone, I was in complete self-destruct mode.”</p><p>The man who sent the text forwarded a nude photograph of her, the source of which she couldn’t figure out. Then he sent a link to her mother’s Facebook account and the names of other family members and school friends, threatening to forward the picture to them if she didn’t follow his instructions. Immediately, she recalled an episode from a few years earlier, when classmates passed around a photo of her in her underwear, which precipitated months of bullying and a bout of depression. Panicked, she complied with his requests. He first instructed her to brighten the lighting in her room, and to take photos of herself in her underwear. He then had her take more photos, this time naked, and take videos of herself stripping and masturbating. The videos became progressively more explicit, Rachel told me, until the man asked her to do something so revolting that she refused. She cut off the correspondence and sat on her bed “in a state of shock,” she said. Later, her mother came in to say good night. Rachel pretended that everything was fine.</p><p>The next day, Rachel (a pseudonym) checked her social-media accounts every hour, waiting for the pictures and videos to surface. Months went by and nothing happened. Then one day she was in a taxi when a boy who lived near her sent a message asking if she was all right. He included a link to a Tumblr page that contained dozens of folders of pictures and videos of several girls, all in similar poses, many of them crying. One of the girls was Rachel. She asked the boy to report the account to Tumblr. Rachel told me that she thought about going to another city and killing herself. “I actually ended up getting on a train, but my friends stopped me,” she said.</p><p>The pictures and videos soon spread to Pornhub, one of the largest pornography sites on the Internet. At one point, Pornhub hosted some fourteen million videos, including studio-produced adult films and user-generated content, and it is one of the most visited Web sites in the world. Many of the videos of Rachel included her real name, and comments contained links to her social-media accounts and to those of her family members. A snippet from one of the videos was posted to Snapchat and Instagram. Someone sent a video to her father, and a stalker showed up at her house, texting her photos from outside while she was babysitting her younger brother. Rachel filed a complaint with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command, a division of the U.K.’s National Crime Agency, but the organization was of little help, she said.</p><p>Rachel stopped sleeping, and spent her days and nights searching for the videos and filling out dozens of removal-request forms. “Hi, I’m underage and had many videos and photos posted of me on here,” she wrote to Pornhub in December, 2018. “They keep getting reuploaded onto this site and I am only 15 in them and I don’t have the links. I don’t know what to do because every time I get them removed you keep allowing them to be uploaded its ruining my life.” In response, Pornhub asked for a link to each video, the username of the account used to upload it, the title of the file, or screenshots of the page. Rachel sent the information when she had it, but the videos were often uploaded in tiny clips that she found impossible to track. Each time one was taken down, more appeared. Finally, she gave up. “I was spending all my time reporting videos,” she said. “It was taking a lot out of me.”</p><p>Rachel stopped leaving the house and eventually went on public assistance. In February, 2020, she saw an Instagram post about the work of an American anti-sex-trafficking activist named Laila Mickelwait. She messaged Mickelwait, who referred her to services that could help with the takedown requests, and connected her with lawyers from Brown Rudnick, a firm that was assembling a lawsuit against MindGeek, the company that owns Pornhub, on behalf of people who’d allegedly had videos of themselves posted to the site without their consent. After lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter to MindGeek, the company quickly removed videos of Rachel; it then blocked them from being uploaded again. “Laila was so helpful,” Rachel told me. “She did more for me than any police or anyone in the U.K. ever did.”</p><p>At the time, Mickelwait was working for an organization called Exodus Cry, a faith-based group that seeks to “abolish commercial sexual exploitation,” along with the underlying conditions that the group sees as enabling it. Mickelwait, who is thirty-nine, had worked at Exodus Cry since 2012, and her focus was on trying to prevent adults and children from becoming victims of coerced prostitution and other forms of sexual abuse. “I always felt a specific passion for prevention,” she told me. “It’s wonderful when you can take someone out of exploitation, but it would be better if they were never there in the first place.”</p><p>Mickelwait had spent several years presenting “Nefarious: Merchant of Souls,” an anti-trafficking documentary made by Exodus Cry, to governments and public audiences around the world, and advocating for harsher penalties for trafficking convictions. Increasingly, though, her work centered on women and children, many of them victims of trafficking, whose explicit videos had ended up on pornographic Web sites such as Pornhub. MindGeek’s policies stated that videos on its site were vetted, to make sure that they didn’t feature minors, and were uploaded with the consent of the people who appeared in them. But the company had recently been in the news after being accused of failing to adequately screen its content. A thirty-year-old man had been arrested in Florida for lewd and lascivious battery of a fifteen-year-old girl who had been missing for nearly a year; her family had found approximately fifty-eight videos of her on Pornhub and other Web sites. (The company says that it removed the material the day it was notified.) Shortly after that, the <em>Sunday Times</em> of London published an article about the corporations that advertise on Pornhub, including Heinz and Unilever, and noted that its reporters had found “dozens of examples of illegal material on the website within minutes.” (The company replied that child-sexual-abuse material made up a tiny proportion of content, and that the aim was to eradicate it.)</p><p>Late one night in early 2020, Mickelwait’s baby started crying. Since surviving a difficult birth three months earlier, he had been colicky, often wailing inconsolably for long stretches. “It was definitely one of the hardest periods of my life,” she told me recently. “I thought I was going to die.” While trying to rock the baby back to sleep, she decided to check MindGeek’s claims about vetting.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Mickelwait pulled out her laptop, created a dummy e-mail account, and uploaded a video of a darkened corner of her bedroom to Pornhub. It appeared to go live almost instantly. No one had verified who she was, her age, or what her video contained. (MindGeek claims that, until review, the video would have been available only to Mickelwait.) “I began to be haunted by the question of: Why are we assuming these are legal and consensual videos?” Mickelwait said. The next day, she tweeted, “I could’ve been a trafficked 12 yr old and no one would know. Pornhub enables exploitation.”</p><p>“It wasn’t new information—millions of people already knew that,” Mickelwait said. “But for some reason people hadn’t been connecting the dots as to what that means for what’s on the site. I felt like people needed to know the most popular porn site in the world was populated with crime-scene videos.” Mickelwait wrote an opinion piece, submitting it to twelve publications. The Washington <em>Examiner</em>, a conservative news outlet, agreed to publish it. “At this very moment, there could be hundreds, if not thousands, of videos of underage sex trafficking victims on Pornhub,” she wrote. “It’s time to shut down super-predator site Pornhub and hold the executive megapimps behind it accountable.”</p><p>MindGeek is registered in the tax haven of Luxembourg, but its main office is in Montreal. The company employs around sixteen hundred people, and the online platforms it owns, which include Pornhub, RedTube, YouPorn, and Brazzers, received approximately 4.5 trillion visits each month in 2020, according to a company spokesperson—almost double Google and Facebook combined. MindGeek’s owners and investors have taken pains to obscure their identities, but once Mickelwait began investigating the company, she said, a former employee shared the names of the top executives: Feras Antoon, the chief executive officer; David Tassillo, the chief operating officer; and Corey Urman, a vice-president, who ran Pornhub.</p><p>Pornhub’s origins date back to 2007, when an entrepreneur named Matt Keezer bought the domain for about three thousand dollars, after cold-calling its owner. Keezer joined with several business partners, including Stephane Manos and Ouissam Youssef, whom he had met through Foosball tournaments when they were all students at Concordia University, in Montreal. A few of the business partners had recently started a paid porn site called Brazzers. Folding Brazzers and Pornhub into a new company, the partners named it Mansef, a combination of “Manos” and “Youssef.”</p><p>Mansef came close to disaster soon after its founding. In October, 2009, agents from the U.S. Secret Service Organized Fraud Task Force obtained warrants to seize more than six million dollars from two accounts held by a Mansef-linked company called Premium Services. The company seemed to have no address aside from a rented mailbox in Cumming, Georgia, a town of five thousand people. But, in two months, it had received $9.4 million and wired out four million dollars. None of the money seemed to have been used for paying salaries or for other legitimate expenses. The government charged Premium Services with operating an unlicensed money-transferring business. Mansef said that the payments were from third-party credit-card processors and to its U.S. venders. In 2011, the government settled the case, agreeing to return $4.15 million. The company was saved. More significant, the case was an indication that the government had not caught up to the realities of the new business of Internet pornography.</p><p>In the wake of the sexual revolution of the sixties and seventies, adult-video studios sprouted up in California’s San Fernando Valley—which came to be known as Porn Valley—and produced films that were distributed across the country. In 1988, responding in part to public outrage after Traci Lords appeared in porn films when she was underage, Congress passed U.S. Code 2257, requiring producers to document that their performers were eighteen or older.</p><p>The launch of YouTube, in 2005, made it easy to upload videos that could be viewed by anyone; soon afterward, entrepreneurs started what came to be known as “tube sites”—including RedTube and YouPorn—which allowed users to upload and view pornographic videos for free. Many were pirated copies of professional films, and the revenue that once flowed to the California movie studios was redirected to the operators of the tube sites. The resulting copyright battles in the porn industry mirrored those in traditional entertainment. In 2007, Viacom sued YouTube, accusing it of hosting pirated copies of “SpongeBob SquarePants” and “The Daily Show,” among other material, and asked for a billion dollars in damages. That same year, a porn producer called Vivid Entertainment sued PornoTube, accusing the site of hosting pirated copies of Vivid’s material. (Viacom settled, and Vivid’s case was dropped.)</p><p>The Internet made it possible for tube sites to make money off videos created by others while bearing almost no responsibility for what was in them. Today, MindGeek relies on the same legal statute that Mark Zuckerberg cites when defending Facebook from charges that it allows the proliferation of disinformation: Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which states that an “interactive computer service” cannot be treated as a publisher of information provided by a third party. The provision was conceived in order to allow the Internet to grow without being buried in lawsuits. But it also means that, when tube sites are confronted with complaints about videos depicting rape, sexual images of children, revenge porn, and other content uploaded without consent, they can claim that they are not liable. Experts at the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, a nonprofit organization that tracks child-sexual-abuse material, told me that this has allowed the online porn industry to grow with little accountability. “The liability is low, the money is high,” Staca Shehan, the vice-president of the organization’s analytical-services division, said. “That’s a business model that people are going to get into.”</p><p>In 2009—months after the government seized Mansef’s bank account—a German Internet impresario named Fabian Thylmann bought the company, changing the name to Manwin. Thylmann, who was in his early thirties, had previously helped develop software that allowed adult Web sites to track the success of their ads and links—an early version of cookies.</p><p>Pornhub became Manwin’s flagship tube site. In the early years of online pornography, the tube sites were despised by many in the porn industry for giving away their content for free, but Thylmann seemed to relish his image. “Fabian’s approach was: We’re a porn company, we’re going to flaunt it,” a former senior manager at MindGeek told me. An online industry forum called gfy.com was filled with scathing discussions about the pirating of content. “I just went to xtube.com, within 1 click I found several scenes of mine that are there illegally,” a participant told “Nathan,” the pseudonym Thylmann used on the site. “By allowing uploads of full scenes from anyone, you know from balls to bones you are violating copyright law and profiting from stolen content.”</p><p>Traditional financial firms are often reluctant to do business with companies that produce adult content. “They know you can make a lot of money,” a former MindGeek executive told me. “But this can backfire on you heavily if regular clients find out your bank is dealing with a porn company.” In April, 2011, Thylmann was able to secure a three-hundred-and-sixty-two-million-dollar loan, arranged in part by a New York hedge fund called Colbeck Capital, at an exorbitant interest rate. Thylmann quickly struck a deal to run Playboy TV and acquired the pornography producer Digital Playground. He also purchased Webcam sites, where performers live-stream themselves to paying viewers. The German newspaper <em>Die</em> <em>Welt</em> compared him to the founders of Facebook and Google.</p><p>In 2012, Thylmann was arrested, in Belgium, for tax evasion, and extradited to Germany. Alexander Pschorr, the former C.E.O. of Manwin in Germany, told me that, after Thylmann was released, he boasted about how well he’d been treated in jail. “Some guards told him, ‘Oh, you’re the owner of this and that?’ ” Pschorr said. “ ‘My girlfriend is an amateur performer. Do you have some tips about how she could make some money?’ ” The former senior manager, who worked in the company’s office in Montreal, told me that executives there downplayed the arrest; it was described as “just taxes.” Still, Manwin’s German banker, Commerzbank, announced that it would no longer do business with the company, and soon afterward Feras Antoon took over Manwin’s operations. “It wasn’t even like a coup,” the former manager recalled. “Feras had always been the guy with the most internal visibility. He made all the decisions.” (Thylmann later pleaded guilty to tax evasion.)</p><p>Along with David Tassillo, the company’s chief operating officer, and an Austrian investor named Bernd Bergmair, Antoon bought the company from Thylmann. Bergmair already owned a porn site called RedTube, and the companies merged. Antoon became the C.E.O. of the new company. He renamed it MindGeek and restructured the international offices, firing staff in Germany. A stockpile of Manwin-branded water bottles and sweatshirts was thrown out.</p><p>There was a family element to the business. Antoon’s brother, Mark, ran a video-game division for the company; his sister joined, for a time, as a travel coördinator, and her husband oversaw the cafeteria. Antoon’s parents, who had immigrated to Canada from Syria, often visited the office. The former manager described Antoon as “a ridiculously proud family man,” and junior-level employees grumbled that there was no way to advance without a personal connection. There were no women in leadership; according to the former manager, Antoon and his deputies occasionally made demeaning remarks about female employees when they left the room, commenting on their hair or clothing. “They were misogynistic,” the former manager said. “It was very old-school thinking, a very two-dimensional view of women.” (The company denied this, and said that it had an inclusive workplace.)</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>MindGeek’s corporate structure is complicated, with dozens of subsidiaries around the world whose names can obscure their ownership. It maintains offices in Luxembourg, the U.K., and Romania; the office that handles MindGeek’s content is in Cyprus. The company’s headquarters is an aquamarine glass office building in Montreal, where Antoon surrounds himself with a tight group of confidants that some employees referred to as the “bro club.” Antoon has a full face, small, bright eyes, and a trim beard. He and the other executives wear expensive suits and watches and gel their hair back. Antoon has spent lavishly on furniture and art work for the office, trying to emulate the appearance of the tech firms of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Some executives hid the fact that they worked in the porn industry, occasionally using pseudonyms. “They wanted to really come across as an engineering firm,” the former manager told me. For years, Corey Urman, who ran Pornhub until September, 2021, identified himself in the press as Corey Price. Employees later said that concealing their identities was a safety issue, because they were harassed and threatened by anti-porn protesters; the hundred-and-eighty-page document left by the racist mass shooter in Buffalo included a rant about the harms caused by pornography and a list of executives at MindGeek and Pornhub interposed with anti-Semitic imagery. But the secrecy also served to protect employees’ reputations. “This industry is different,” the former executive told me. “When I met someone and they said, ‘I’m Tom,’ it was absolutely clear that the guy was not called Tom. In porn, as an executive, you just don’t use your own name. One of the biggest assets is that you keep your personal life absolutely secret.”</p><p>Like other tech platforms, MindGeek has little incentive to remove potentially profitable content. The company makes about half its revenue by selling ads on its Web sites. It also charges some users fees for access to its paid porn sites, and enters profit-sharing agreements with porn producers, taking a commission on the revenue that producers make posting their films on its sites. Web traffic is central to all of this.</p><p>A woman named Tina, a technology assistant and mother of three, told me that, in 2019, an abusive ex-boyfriend posted explicit videos of her on Pornhub without her permission. In addition to reporting the matter to the police, she said, she spent months filling out takedown requests on the site, explaining that the videos had been posted without her consent and contained her and her children’s real names and home address. The responses usually took several days, she said, and the company repeatedly asked her for proof of her claims. When the videos were removed, she said, they might reappear hours later, like a replicating virus, sometimes broken down into dozens of clips of a few seconds each. (Her ex-boyfriend was eventually arrested, and pleaded guilty to criminal contempt, a misdemeanor.) A spokesperson for MindGeek said that, without additional information about Tina, the company could not comment about what steps it had taken.</p><p>I heard similar stories from several other women, including a pregnant mother who was in the Air Force when she discovered, in 2018, that her ex-husband had secretly filmed them having sex and posted the videos on Pornhub. She soon found out that he’d done the same thing to other women. After alerting the company and asking to have her videos taken down, she said, she waited days for a response that was not automated, and was asked repeatedly to prove that they were of her. “I can’t even tell you how many hundreds of hours I spent doing this,” she told me. “I wasn’t sleeping, I was crying all the time. It was all I did, twenty-four hours a day.” (The spokesperson said that the company believed it had disabled two videos the day the links were submitted, and another one a day after, upon confirming the identity of the woman in the video.)</p><p>At the time, MindGeek had the technical ability to remove videos from its sites while they were being investigated, a former employee told me, but it didn’t always use those tools. “They will purposely delay,” the former employee said. “They’ll say, ‘We’ll get back to you in two, three days once we do our review.’ ” By the time a review was complete, a video could have been up for several days, and ad space sold against it. “The user did not get punished,” the former employee went on. “MindGeek still made money.”</p><p>MindGeek’s policies forbid uploading content that features child sexual abuse, that reveals personally identifiable information such as names and addresses, or that is obtained without consent. Prior to 2020, the company employed a handful of “content formatters” in Montreal to review videos, along with their tags and metadata, according to a former employee who worked in the department. (The spokesperson said that formatters made up only a small part of the company’s compliance efforts.) According to the former employee, many formatters, who were paid about thirty thousand dollars a year, were deeply traumatized by what they saw. There were occasional videos depicting rape, child sexual abuse, and the torture of animals. In obvious cases involving minors, the videos were taken down, and the accounts of the users who uploaded them were deleted. But, according to the former employee, the formatters did not notify law enforcement, ostensibly because many uploaders use virtual private networks to disguise their identities and locations, which could cause the police to target the wrong person. Formatters sometimes suggested blocking the I.P. addresses of people who repeatedly violated the policies, or requiring that uploaders provide valid identification and e-mail addresses, the former employee said, but their supervisors said that this would discourage use of MindGeek’s sites. “A user could upload a hundred videos of someone getting decapitated,” the former employee told me. “We’d just close the videos, but not block their account. They could just upload them again the next day.” (The company denies this.) The job of screening the videos was eventually moved to Cyprus, where moderators viewed hundreds of videos a day, often fast-forwarding through them with the sound off to get through as many as possible. (The spokesperson said that this was a “fundamental misunderstanding” of the process, that formatters’ managers were responsible for reporting suspect material to law enforcement, and that blocking I.P. addresses would not have been effective, since they are not always tied to individual users.) “Their objective was not necessarily to cause harm,” the former employee said, of company executives. “Their objective was to make money.”</p><p>Pschorr, the former C.E.O. of Manwin in Germany, told me that laws governing pornography are more stringent in Germany than they are in the U.S. During his time with the company, he said, it employed twenty-four customer-support agents and content screeners to review all German content before it went live. Pschorr was surprised by the lack of regulation in the U.S. “It was always interesting for me as a German to see that, in the U.S., you’d get I.D.’d if you went to a bar, and if you’re not twenty-one you get in big trouble,” he said. “But if you want to consume porn all you have to do is click ‘Yes, I’m 18,’ and you’re in the realm of dirt.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>MindGeek was alert to the concerns of the credit-card companies. Mike Stabile, the director of public affairs for an adult-entertainment trade and advocacy association called the Free Speech Coalition, told me that answering to financial institutions was typical in the porn business. “Once everything moved online, it shifted from ‘The government said you can’t do this’ to ‘The banks said you can’t do this,’ ” he said. “You were no longer arguing with a state attorney general or the F.B.I., you were arguing with a middle manager at a bank who was worried about the bank’s reputation. And with Visa and Mastercard you have a duopoly. If you lose either of them or both of them, it ruins your business.” (Spokespeople for Visa and Mastercard said that as long as transactions are legal the companies don’t make judgments about what people are purchasing. They issue ethical guidelines that dictate what porn platforms can show.)</p><p>In 2018, MindGeek refinanced its loans, increasing its borrowing to nearly four hundred million dollars, in order to continue to expand, and made another four hundred million in revenue. “They were after monopoly a hundred per cent,” the former senior manager said. “They wanted world domination.” (The company denies this.) Antoon began construction on a residence in the Ahuntsic-Cartierville borough of Montreal, whose renderings were reminiscent of the grand estates of Europe. The house was designed with eight bedrooms, a cinema, a sports complex, and an infinity pool surrounded by terraced walkways and manicured gardens.</p><p>On a recent visit to New York, Laila Mickelwait sat in the lobby of a hotel near LaGuardia Airport, sipping tea. She has green eyes and long blond hair and tends to dress in black. She was raised in Riverside, California, where her mother, a former teacher, stayed home with Mickelwait and her two sisters. Her father, a vascular surgeon, had grown up in Jordan during the civil war. Mickelwait recalled that he had a seriousness about him, and that he rarely watched television or movies for fun. He had a passion for social justice, which he imparted to his children. Mickelwait began training as an acrobat when she was eight, and as a teen-ager she was accepted to Cirque du Soleil. Her father wouldn’t let her go. She studied political science at the University of California, Riverside, and got a graduate degree in public diplomacy at the University of Southern California. In college, while researching causes including global poverty and war crimes, she came across the issue of sex trafficking, and was shocked by what she learned. “I just felt like from an early age I had it in me to care about this,” she said.</p><p>Mickelwait interned at the United Nations, working on projects related to human trafficking. In 2006, she founded a nonprofit called New Reality International that sought to provide health care and other services to impoverished women and children around the world. In 2012, she joined Exodus Cry, occasionally attending prayer meetings at an evangelical ministry in Kansas City, Missouri, called the International House of Prayer (<em>IHOPKC</em>), which is known for music, fasting, and a prayer room that operates twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Mickelwait’s work is partly a response to how easily children can access even the most violent pornography online. In an interview with Defend Young Minds, an organization that lobbies to keep porn away from kids, she said, “I call this a form of secondhand sexual abuse—for a child to be exposed to rape, for example, as their introduction to sex when they’re eight, nine, ten, eleven years old. But, also, there are children being abused behind the screen. Those are the ones being used in the films. So there’s abuse going on on both sides.” Mickelwait told me that her title at Exodus Cry, Director of Abolition, was modelled on figures such as William Wilberforce, who led the British movement to abolish the slave trade in the nineteenth century.</p><p>Exodus Cry was founded around 2008 by Benjamin Nolot, a filmmaker and an activist who grew up in Southern California and joined <em>IHOPKC</em> in his twenties. Exodus Cry has taken aim not only at nonconsensual pornography but more broadly at what it calls “porn culture,” which, it argues, leads to the hypersexualization and objectification of women and makes sex trafficking and other crimes more likely to occur. The group’s tax filings state that it is “committed to abolishing sex trafficking and the commercial sex industry,” which would include legal activities such as producing pornography and performing in strip clubs. In 2017, Nolot released a documentary called “Liberated: The New Sexual Revolution,” about the relationship between spring-break partying, hookup culture, and sexual violence; more recently, he made “Raised on Porn: The New Sex Ed,” which explores the effects on children of unfettered access to online porn. When I contacted MindGeek, a spokesman who goes by Ian Andrews sent me a list of news articles about Exodus Cry and <em>IHOPKC</em> that he recommended I read. One, from the Daily Beast, described Exodus Cry as “a shady Evangelical group with Trump ties” and noted that <em>IHOPKC</em>’s founder, Mike Bickle, preaches that homosexuality is a sin. Another Daily Beast story highlighted <em>IHOPKC</em>’s role in helping lay the groundwork in Uganda for the country’s notorious anti-gay legislation, which punishes homosexuality with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. (On <em>IHOPKC</em>’s Web site, the organization denies supporting the bill.) A story in the magazine <em>Reason</em> noted that Exodus Cry often teams up with the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, a nonprofit that was previously known as Morality in Media, which became infamous in the eighties and nineties for promoting boycotts of soap operas and MTV, and for campaigning against the National Endowment for the Arts.</p><p>When I reached Nolot, he told me that he knew nothing about <em>IHOPKC</em>’s alleged role in Uganda until he read about it in the press, and said the idea that the church promoted anti-gay laws there “was utterly abhorrent.” The God he believes in, he said, would never reject people for their life style or their beliefs. “I am very aware that there are marginalized groups of people, whether by sexuality or by race or by gender or whatever,” he said. “I don’t want to be a part of anything that would bring further condemnation.” Nolot reiterated that Exodus Cry and <em>IHOPKC</em> were not the same thing, and said that he deeply regretted tweeting, in 2013, that gay marriage was “an unspeakable offense to God.”</p><p>To Nolot, trafficking and pornography are inextricably linked, and the creation of porn is coercive by definition. Arguments like his were once made by feminists such as Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon, the scholar who in 1979 helped develop the legal theory that sexual harassment was a civil-rights violation. The Dworkin-MacKinnon faction saw pornography as a problem with two main components, both of which promoted misogyny and violence against women: onscreen, there were depictions of female subordination and male-centric pleasure; behind the scenes, women were exploited in the production of it. In 1980, activists led protests against the film “Deep Throat” after its star, Linda Lovelace, said that she had been raped and coerced into making it. A so-called sex-positive wing of feminism, led by Ellen Willis and others, soon argued, however, that anti-porn feminists were censors who ignored the complicated reality of women’s sexual desires. Linda Hirshman, a cultural historian and the author of several books about social movements, told me that not only did Dworkin and MacKinnon lose the debate but that they and their allies were attacked so harshly that it silenced others. This left conservative Christian groups as among the most prominent forces raising concerns about abuses in the porn industry. “But the question you always want to ask these Christian anti-porn activists is: Where do you stand on abortion rights?” Hirshman said. “Where do you stand on birth control? Where do you stand on equal pay? Otherwise, you get into the car with the Christian right, and the next thing you know you’re in Bluebeard’s castle.”</p><p>Kate D’Adamo, an advocate for sex workers’ rights at Reframe Health and Justice, told me that, because Pornhub occupies a near-monopoly in the industry, many sex workers depend on it to survive; if it disappeared suddenly, it would be financially devastating for people who are already in a precarious situation. “There are people who work in anti-trafficking who do talk to sex workers, and say, ‘If this is the legislative change, how would that impact you?’ ” D’Adamo said. “But if your argument is to shut down Pornhub then you don’t care about the people who work in the industry.” Mike Stabile, of the Free Speech Coalition, noted that the tools to screen user-generated pornography had taken years to evolve and become more effective, and said that the fixation on Pornhub suggested that the leaders of the anti-trafficking movement were being disingenuous about their goals. “This isn’t a Pornhub-specific problem or an issue where Pornhub is particularly negligent,” Stabile said. “If you look at the vast majority of child-sex-abuse material being shared, it is not on porn sites, it’s on sites like Snapchat and Facebook. This is about stopping pornography.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Mickelwait seems frustrated by the fact that MindGeek and other companies can deflect attention from criticism by questioning the motives of anti-trafficking activists. MindGeek, she told me, “has engaged in illegal conduct that has really shattered the lives of victims who never intended to be in pornography, who did not sign up to be porn performers. These are people who were raped, or trafficked, or filmed without their knowledge or consent.” She added, “I believe all adults should have the freedom to do what they wish with their own bodies so long as their actions are consensual, lawful, and not harming another person.” Last year, Mickelwait left Exodus Cry to found her own nonprofit, the Justice Defense Fund, which focusses exclusively on sex trafficking, child sexual abuse, and nonconsensual content online. She would not tell me who the group’s funders are, and said that it has received contributions from “hundreds of donors from around the world who participate with the understanding that we maintain their privacy.”</p><p>According to Mickelwait, the only way to reform the porn industry is to hold its leaders accountable for the content on their sites. “This doesn’t mean an end to the porn industry,” she said. “It means moving the industry to operate legally.” She noted that some porn performers agreed with her. One, Allie Eve Knox, told me that most porn performers were not eager to side with the Christian right, but that nonconsensual content and child-sexual-abuse material on Pornhub made the industry less safe for them. “We need to have an outcry. We need to hold people accountable,” she said. “This stuff should not be allowed to happen. It’s a fucking travesty to our business.”</p><p>Mickelwait’s op-ed in the Washington <em>Examiner</em> was shared extensively on Twitter, and she and other activists started using the hashtag #Traffickinghub; a Twitter user designed a logo to go with it, in the black, white, and yellow that Pornhub uses in its branding. Mickelwait copied her op-ed into a Change.org petition that quickly amassed thousands of signatures. (It’s now hosted on a different Web site, which indicates that it has been signed by more than two million people.)</p><p>The publicity came at a cost. Anonymous posters published information about where Mickelwait and her family members lived; some relatives had their online accounts hacked. Law enforcement received a phone call falsely accusing Mickelwait of “repeatedly posting child pornography on her personal Twitter account,” according to the police report.</p><p>In March, 2020, members of the Canadian Parliament asked the government, in a letter to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, to investigate MindGeek, and then launched a parliamentary investigation. That month, MindGeek registered for the first time with the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children, and turned over more than thirteen thousand videos of suspected child-sexual-abuse material. (Most major tech platforms are already registered with the N.C.M.E.C.; Facebook made more than twenty million reports to the agency in 2020.) MindGeek hired the law firm Kaplan, Hecker &amp; Fink to conduct a review so that the company could build a stringent content-compliance program.</p><p>That December, the <em>Times</em> columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote an exposé called “The Children of Pornhub,” alleging that the site was “infested with rape videos.” He cited Mickelwait’s petition. After Kristof’s piece was published, a former employee told me, MindGeek management sent a company-wide e-mail denying the allegations, and arguing that the company’s filtering and moderation policies were effective. “It was complete B.S.,” the former employee said. Six days later, Visa and Mastercard announced that they would no longer process payments for Pornhub. This sent a strong message, but, Knox told me, the people who suffered the most were professional porn creators, who could no longer collect payments. Some she knew had been driven into less safe work, such as escorting.</p><p>On December 14th, MindGeek announced that it would require users to verify their identities through a third-party Web site before they uploaded videos, and that it would disable millions of videos from unregistered users. In a blog post, the company argued that its policies were now more stringent than those of all its peers, including Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube. “It is clear that Pornhub is being targeted not because of our policies and how we compare to our peers, but because we are an adult content platform,” the post read. It said that the company was being attacked by Exodus Cry and the National Center on Sexual Exploitation: “These are organizations dedicated to abolishing pornography, banning material they claim is obscene, and shutting down commercial sex work.” Months later, one of MindGeek’s auditors, Grant Thornton, ended its relationship with the company.</p><p>The Canadian parliamentary committee investigating MindGeek scheduled hearings for February, 2021. MindGeek sent a letter to the committee, outlining its new content policies and promising even more rigorous ones in the future. Only verified users, whose names and ages had been confirmed through government-issued identification, would be allowed to upload content to the company’s Web sites. Digital-fingerprinting software was being applied in all suspected cases of child-sexual-abuse and nonconsensual videos, which would prevent them from being re-uploaded in the future. The company also said that it had been developing software to identify and remove nonconsensual videos, which it planned to make available to other online platforms.</p><p>At the hearings, Serena Fleites, a young woman from California, testified that, in seventh grade, a boy she liked had badgered her into sending him a video of herself undressing. The video had been posted to Pornhub with the caption “13 year-old brunette shows off for the camera.” As the clip began to circulate among her classmates, she started skipping class, and eventually dropped out. She said that she made many attempts to get Pornhub to take the video down—even sending e-mails that she claimed were from her mother. Her attorney, Michael Bowe, of Brown Rudnick, tried to distance her case from the religious anti-trafficking groups, telling the committee, “This is about rape, not porn. It’s about trafficking, not consensual adult performance or entertainment. ”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Four days later, MindGeek’s top executives testified. It seemed as if they hadn’t prepared for even the most elementary questions. Antoon was unable to say how much money the company made, how many complaints it received about nonconsensual videos, or why it hadn’t made any substantive policy changes until Visa and Mastercard pulled their business. When an M.P. named Shannon Stubbs asked whether MindGeek “had ever monetized child sexual abuse and nonconsensual material,” Antoon refused to answer directly, and stated that such content was harmful to the company’s brand. He said that Pornhub was “among the top five most visited Web sites on the Internet.” But later, when Tassillo, MindGeek’s C.O.O., was asked why the company had waited until 2020 to refer complaints to the N.C.M.E.C., he said, “We are a startup and are still growing.”</p><p>When pressed on Fleites’s case, Antoon said, “I’m heartbroken when I hear these stories.” He said that the first time he had heard of Fleites was five months earlier, when Nicholas Kristof contacted the company for his article, and that, with only her first and last name, it was “impossible to know” if she had ever asked the company to remove her content. An M.P. asked whether the company had any records of reporting Fleites’s case to the police. Tassillo replied, “We might have records of this. We have never said that she’s lying. We just don’t know.”</p><p>Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, an M.P. from Toronto, told me, “The amount of money these platforms are generating and the insignificant sums they are outlaying to protect people on their platforms—and in the case of Pornhub it’s such sensitive material that’s being shared—I think it’s unacceptable.”</p><p>Later that month, the parliamentary committee heard testimony from three more women, including Rachel. She told the story of the night she was blackmailed into sending sexual pictures and videos over WhatsApp. “I think it’s important you understand the type of stuff I was subjected to that night and how depraved the man behind it was, so you can truly understand what Pornhub’s been profiting from,” she said. “To see Corey Urman”—the head of Pornhub—“smile and explain that he uses aliases to protect his identity, when he has the choice to post or not to post, is disgusting, because I had no choice about being uploaded to Pornhub and having my personal details exposed to the world.”</p><p>Afterward, Mickelwait read accounts from other women and girls who she said had contacted her. “Kate,” she said, was fifteen when her twenty-year-old boyfriend filmed them having sex and later uploaded the video without her permission; Pornhub didn’t do anything when she asked for it to be taken down. “Beth” was raped by an uncle when she was ten, and found videos of the rape two years later on Pornhub. “Caroline” spent two months begging Pornhub to remove videos of her sexual assault, at age fifteen, in which she was screaming and had a bloody nose. Mickelwait listed examples of revenge porn still on the site. Then she thanked the committee for conducting the investigation.</p><p>A few weeks after the hearing, fire trucks converged on Ahuntsic-Cartierville, where Antoon’s new mansion was being consumed by a raging fire. Although the house was still under construction, Antoon had put it up for sale earlier that month, for about sixteen million U.S. dollars. Some eighty firefighters spent most of the night trying to bring the blaze under control. By the next morning, almost nothing was left of the house. Montreal police are investigating the fire as a case of arson. Antoon, in an interview with <em>Vanity Fair</em>, hinted that anti-trafficking activists might be responsible. “Could the extreme religious groups have incited and encouraged someone to do this? Absolutely,” he said. “When you use extremist language and QAnon sentiment toward child trafficking, your words are going to attract and mobilize some of the darkest corners of the internet.”</p><p>In June, 2021, Brown Rudnick, the law firm representing Fleites, Rachel, and more than thirty other women, filed a lawsuit against MindGeek. Lauren Tabaksblat, one of the attorneys, said that her clients were seeking to compel MindGeek to “adopt practices that ensure only consensual content is on its platform.” (A judge later ruled that the women must bring individual lawsuits. Brown Rudnick plans to refile.) The day the initial suit was filed, the Canadian House of Commons released an ethics report that called for MindGeek and other companies to practice strict age verification. Canadian law-enforcement agents have said that they are looking into Pornhub’s actions, but they will not confirm whether they have opened criminal investigations.</p><p>Last year, as MindGeek’s legal troubles grew, Antoon began efforts to sell the company. The rise of OnlyFans—a Web site that allows performers to set up their own channels with paying subscribers—and the flurry of bad press seemed disastrous for Pornhub. According to a corporate presentation reviewed by the Logic, a Canadian tech-news site, Pornhub’s traffic declined by forty per cent in the year after the Kristof column was published. A group led by a cannabis entrepreneur named Chuck Rifici offered to buy the company for a reported five hundred and twenty-five million dollars. In the end, MindGeek rejected the offer.</p><p>MindGeek’s legal cases may test the limits of Section 230 protections—a situation that could have implications for social-media platforms. Last February, two women filed a lawsuit in Alabama alleging that videos of them being sexually assaulted as teen-agers were posted on Pornhub without their consent—and that the company had shared revenue from the videos with their rapists, who had uploaded the material. (The company denies the allegations.) MindGeek argued to have the case dismissed, citing Section 230, which, the company wrote, granted it “broad immunity from liability for content posted to its websites by third parties.” The judge denied MindGeek’s motion, stating that, by providing incentives for the creation of child-sexual-abuse material, the company had forfeited Section 230 protection. “Child pornography is not lawful ‘information provided by another information content provider’ as contemplated by Section 230,” the judge wrote. “Rather, it is illegal contraband, stemming from the sexual abuse of a child, beyond the covering of First Amendment protection, and wholly outside any other protection or immunity under the law.” The judge noted that individuals were prosecuted for possessing such material on a regular basis, adding, “How, then, could a corporate defendant escape punishment for the same illegal conduct?”</p><p>After an assessment that lasted more than a year, Kaplan, Hecker &amp; Fink produced a report with more than ninety recommendations of ways for the company to improve its procedures for keeping nonconsensual videos off Pornhub and its other sites. MindGeek declined to release the report, but said that it has continued to tighten its content policies, and that in 2021 it removed content reported to the N.C.M.E.C. faster than any of the major tech platforms did. No content now goes live without passing through human and automated moderation, and when a user flags a video it is disabled until a review is conducted.</p><p>Still, Mickelwait continues to search for illegal content on Pornhub. In January, she said she received a call from a former MindGeek employee who told her that Visa and Mastercard were still processing payments from advertisers. Mickelwait went on the Web site for TrafficJunky, MindGeek’s online advertising business, and noticed that the Visa and Mastercard logos had been removed from the site. But when she initiated a chat with a sales representative, posing as a prospective advertiser, the representative told her that TrafficJunky could still accept ad purchases using all major credit cards.</p><p>Mickelwait sat down to type out a Twitter post. “The lucrative ads on MindGeek owned Pornhub are purchased through TrafficJunky which MindGeek also owns. . . . MasterCard/Visa process the payments for the ads,” she wrote. “Hold them accountable.” ♦</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
