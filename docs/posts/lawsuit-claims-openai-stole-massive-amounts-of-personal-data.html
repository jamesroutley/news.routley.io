                          <p>OpenAI stole &#34;massive amounts of personal data&#34; to train ChatGPT, a lawsuit alleges.</p><p>The proposed class-action suit claims that Sam Altman&#39;s company &#34;secretly&#34; harvested data to train its large language models so that its chatbot could replicate human language.</p><p>&#34;Despite established protocols for the purchase and use of personal information, Defendants took a different approach: theft,&#34; the lawyers wrote in the <a href="https://assets.bwbx.io/documents/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/rIZH4FXwShJE/v0" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">157-page lawsuit</a>, filed on Wednesday in the US District Court for the Northern District of California.</p><p>The lawsuit alleges that OpenAI crawled the web to amass huge amounts of data, including vast quantities taken from social-media sites. OpenAI&#39;s propertiatary AI corpus of personal data, WebText2, for example, scraped huge amounts of data from Reddit posts and the websites they linked to, the lawsuit claims.</p>
                          
                          <p>The data accessed included &#34;private information and private conversations, medical data, information about children — essentially every piece of data exchanged on the internet it could take — without notice to the owners or users of such data, much less with anyone&#39;s permission,&#34; per the lawsuit.</p><p>This amounted to &#34;the negligent and otherwise illegal theft of personal data of millions of Americans who do not even use AI tools,&#34; the lawsuit claims.</p><p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment, made outside of regular working hours.</p><p>As well as scraping the &#34;digital footprints&#34; of the wider public, the lawsuit claims that OpenAI also stores and discloses users&#39; private information, including the details they enter to create OpenAI accounts, their chat log data, and social media information.</p>
                          
                          <p>Alongside people who use ChatGPT directly, this includes data from people using applications that have integrated ChatGPT, such as Snapchat, Stripe, Spotify, Microsoft Teams, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-marc-benioff-salesforce-slack-artificial-intelligence-gpt-tech-openai-2023-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Slack</a>, the lawsuit alleges. The companies did not immediately respond to Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>The lawsuit is seeking a temporary freeze on commercial access to and commercial development of OpenAI&#39;s products until the company has implemented more regulations and safeguards, including allowing people to opt out of data collection and preventing its products from &#34;surpassing human intelligence and harming others.&#34; The lawsuit also seeks financial compensation for people whose data was accessed to train the bots.</p><p>As well as OpenAI, major backer Microsoft was named as a defendant.</p><p>The plaintiffs were identified only by their initials, occupations, and state, which their lawyers said was to &#34;avoid intrusive scrutiny as well as any potentially dangerous backlash.&#34;</p>
                          
                          <p>Generative AI, which can create text, audio, images, and videos, has exploded in popularity since OpenAI released its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-chat-gpt-2023-1" rel="" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" data-analytics-post-depth="40" data-uri="ec3d9bf025861fffd32f0e95848f17ad">ChatGPT</a> in November. People have been using generative AI for personal, professional, and academic purposes, though there are concerns about its access to data.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-banned-by-regulators-in-italy-over-data-privacy-concerns-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Italy in March announced a temporary ban on access to ChatGPT over privacy concerns</a>, claiming that there was no legal basis to justify &#34;the mass collection and storage of personal data&#34; used to train the algorithms behind ChatGPT. Some companies, including <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-chatgpt-openai-warns-employees-not-share-confidential-information-microsoft-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-microsoft-warns-employees-not-to-share-sensitive-data-openai-2023-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Microsoft</a>, have instructed employees not to enter confidential information into the chatbot. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-chatgpt-bard-data-leak-bans-employee-use-report-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Samsung</a>, meanwhile, has banned staff from generative AI tools.</p><p>Wednesday&#39;s lawsuit says that though AI platforms &#34;undoubtedly have the potential to do much good in the world,&#34; they could also create a &#34;potentially catastrophic risk to humanity.&#34;</p><p>As well as concerns that it could massively disrupt the jobs markets, AI has been known to spread false information and some people have used it for malicious purposes. OpenAI&#39;s creators have said that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-openai-claim-ai-development-superintelligence-humanity-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">AI could surpass human expertise in most areas within the next 10 years</a> and some critics fear the technology <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-supporters-christians-most-concerned-ai-threat-humanity-poll-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">poses an existential risk</a>.</p>
                          
                          <p>&#34;We face imminent and unreasonable risks of the very fabric of our society unraveling, at the hands of profit-driven, multibillion-dollar corporations,&#34; the lawsuit says. </p><p>&#34;Powerful companies, armed with unparalleled and highly concentrated technological capabilities, have recklessly raced to release AI technology with disregard for the catastrophic risk to humanity in the name of &#39;technological advancement,&#39;&#34; the lawsuit says.</p>
