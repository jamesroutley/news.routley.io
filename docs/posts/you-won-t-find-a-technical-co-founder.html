    <h1>You won&#39;t find a technical co-founder</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You probably will not find a technical co-founder online by using one of the many co-founder matching tools.<!-- --></p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried working in the normal &#34;co-founder for equity&#34; set ups.  I&#39;ve been working as a freelancer and contractor for years.<!-- --></p>
<p>This is exclusively from the perspective of searching out a person you <strong>don&#39;t know</strong> online, for the <strong>sole purpose</strong> of <strong>founding a company</strong>.<!-- --></p>

<p>One of the biggest reasons you will absolutely not find anyone is the high standards non technical founders expect.<!-- --></p>
<ul>
<li>has a high level of IC (Individual Contributor) abilities.</li>
<li>has a high level of leadership abilities.</li>
<li>Shares your vision / is passionate about the domain.</li>
<li>is available within 0-2 months.</li>
<li>works completely for free.</li>
<li>Same vibe, same age range.</li>
<li>Commitment to YOUR idea for at least a couple of months.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a absolutely ridiculous list of requirements. That person does not exist. If they do, why would they work with you?<!-- -->
<!-- --></p>
<p>The &#34;instant availability&#34; and the &#34;for free&#34; part are crazy multipliers.<!-- --></p>

<p>Surprisingly I see a lot of founders who want to run the business side of things not think about this at all.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say getting your MVP developed costs 10.000€. That&#39;s a lot of money, so you&#39;re looking for a technical co-founder.<!-- --></p>
<div><p>The technical co-founder just paid 10.000€. In opportunity cost.</p></div>
<p>That is a strange arrangement, if you think about it. It&#39;s your idea. You&#39;re the business person.<!-- --></p>
<p>You&#39;re the one with the vision, right? You&#39;re the one with the passion, right?</p>

<p>Similar to the concept of opportunity cost, I see a lot of business type founders extremely risk averse.</p>
<p>When discussing potential MVP development with clients, founders answers to &#34;equity vs hiring&#34; will boil down to &#34;well.. it could not turn out well and them I&#39;m out 10.000€&#34;.<!-- --></p>
<p>Yes. Yes it could not work out. Welcome to business, welcome to starting a business.</p>
<p>There are risks, don&#39;t push them all on your TECHNICAL co-founder.<!-- --></p>

<p>Non technical founders usually do something like product or marketing or sales or have deep domain expertise and spotted a problem in their industry.<!-- --></p>
<p>If you&#39;re 25+, looking to start a business and do not have access to 10.000€, I question your abilities.</p>
<p>You are the money part of the business. 10.000€ is a lot of money, but if you&#39;re looking to start a company and you&#39;re taking this as serious as many of you project outwards:</p>
<div><p><strong>This</strong> should be one of the first problems that you solve.<!-- --></p></div>

<h3 id="you-find-someone-way-quicker"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#you-find-someone-way-quicker"><span></span></a>You find someone way quicker</h3>
<p>Back to opportunity cost. If you spent an additional 6 months of searching for a co-founder, that could&#39;ve been 6 months of additional revenue.</p>
<h3 id="you-might-find-a-co-founder"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#you-might-find-a-co-founder"><span></span></a>You might find a co-founder</h3>
<p>Who ticks a lot of the boxes in the requirements section.<!-- --></p>
<h3 id="you-dont-need-to-make-sure-they-buy-into-your-vision"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#you-dont-need-to-make-sure-they-buy-into-your-vision"><span></span></a>You don&#39;t need to make sure they buy into your vision</h3>
<p>You&#39;d be surprised how good people are building software about topics they don&#39;t care about, for clients they don&#39;t like. You also actually have ample time to confirm that you DO vibe.</p>
<h3 id="you-get-far-less-scrutiny"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#you-get-far-less-scrutiny"><span></span></a>You get far less scrutiny.</h3>
<p>If you&#39;re a client, I don&#39;t need to question your idea or your abilities.</p>
<h3 id="you-take-on-100-of-the-risk-for-100-of-the-reward"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#you-take-on-100-of-the-risk-for-100-of-the-reward"><span></span></a>You take on 100% of the risk for 100% of the reward</h3>
<p>Kind of self explanatory. 50% of your business for an initial development of 3-6-12 months might be WAY underpriced. How do you know? How about putting off that decision, until you have more information?</p>
<h3 id="you-get-a-much-higher-commitment-level"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#you-get-a-much-higher-commitment-level"><span></span></a>You get a much higher commitment level</h3>
<p>It&#39;s like the sales trick where you give something to people so now they feel like they owe you.<!-- -->
<!-- --></p>
<p>I can only talk about myself, but I noticed I am in a different mindset, when I&#39;m getting paid. Suddenly I focus solely on quality and go deep, instead of getting subtly annoyed, because someone feels entitled to ask me for more and more work for something that maybe, eventually works out.<!-- --></p>
<p>Even working solely for myself at the breakneck saas starter, I take it way less serious. Even though it is making money.<!-- --></p>
<h3 id="you-put-off-decisions-to-a-later-point-with-way-more-information-available"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#you-put-off-decisions-to-a-later-point-with-way-more-information-available"><span></span></a>You put off decisions to a later point with way more information available</h3>
<p>Trying to assess an unknown persons abilities during 2 zoom calls. Their technical abilities, their personality, their commitment level is a joke.<!-- --></p>

<p>Step 1 is realizing the situation you&#39;re in. If you&#39;re 21, studying economics and just looking to try something crazy, thats awesome. I don&#39;t expect you to have the money to pay anyone.</p>
<p>You should just act accordingly. Make it fun. Be grateful. Realize you&#39;re essentially asking people for their free time.<!-- --></p>
<p>Work with people on a similar level.</p>
<p>Software development is a strange field where 20 year olds in university can teach themselves to build a fully functioning product. Realize you&#39;re gambling to find such a person.</p>
<p>Developers are crazy. People work on open source products for free for years. People take time after their job of writing code all day, to write code in their side projects.<!-- --></p>
<p>Delete the fucking chatgpt generated list of requirements for the technical co-founder out of your profile.<!-- -->
<!-- --></p>
<p>Make it a goal to save up 10.000€ and hire someone. You can learn a lot from people who are doing this for a living.<!-- --></p>
<p>Gamble on a lot of people, quickly. Ignore your ridiculous list of requirements. Just try people and see what happens.</p>

<h3 id="the-person-who-built-it-initially-needs-to-stick-around"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#the-person-who-built-it-initially-needs-to-stick-around"><span></span></a>The person who built it initially needs to stick around</h3>
<p>Sure, it&#39;s nice and is purely superior to the alternative, but it is way overblown.<!-- --></p>
<p>Working in an existing project can also be easier, because there are set ways of doing things. There is no decision making required and most problems are figured out.</p>
<p>You&#39;re not gonna run into a problem like &#34;what framework do we use?&#34;, &#34;what UI library do we use?&#34; &#34;How do we validate client side?&#34; &#34;How do we push to production?&#34;.<!-- --></p>
<h3 id="loyalty-differences-between-co-founders-freelancers-and-employees"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#loyalty-differences-between-co-founders-freelancers-and-employees"><span></span></a>Loyalty differences between co-founders, freelancers and employees</h3>
<p>A lot of founders think only equity makes people loyal. Equity and buying into the vision maybe.</p>
<p>90% of the world&#39;s software projects are run by employees. Often not even direct employees of the company, but employees of the development agency, that is hired by the product company.<!-- -->
<!-- --></p>
<p>Which is why every post from developers starts with &#34;im working on a critical project&#34;.<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- --></p>
<p>I am a fan of aligning incentives as well. I think it just makes sense and the standard situation that all employees are in, where their salary is completely decoupled from the outcome is not ideal.</p>
<p>Generally though I see way less people quitting their paid jobs, than quitting equity based start ups.</p>
<h3 id="realize-your-bias"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#realize-your-bias"><span></span></a>Realize your bias</h3>
<p>You&#39;re the business person. The entrepreneur. The idea guy.<!-- -->
<!-- --></p>
<p>If you&#39;re already 1-2 business co-founders, do not look for a third co-founder who is like half technical and half business.<!-- --></p>
<h3 id="passion"><a aria-label="Link to section" href="#passion"><span></span></a>Passion</h3>
<p>I see founders hammer this one a lot.</p>
<p>To me it shows naivety and a fundamental misunderstanding of how passion works in adults.</p>
<div><p>Passion develops over time</p></div>
<p>You <strong>just</strong> told me about organizational change management and expect me to be into it?<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- --></p>
<p>Developers work in domains you never heard of all the time. Passion, especially on day 1, is not required.<!-- -->
<!-- -->
<!-- --></p>
<p>How passionate do you need your accountant to be?</p>
<p>Ask yourself, how passionate are <strong>you</strong> about <strong>software</strong>? And you want to build one now?</p>

<p>Cut your list of requirements for a technical co-founder. Realize that you&#39;re essentially asking someone for a favour, until you have paying customers.</p>
<p>Consider the <strong>costs</strong>, the <strong>opportunity costs</strong> and the <strong>risks</strong> of <strong>paying and not paying</strong> someone to get your idea off the ground.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t expect <strong>your</strong> level of passion and <strong>your</strong> commitment level for <strong>your</strong> idea from someone else.<!-- --></p></div></div>
