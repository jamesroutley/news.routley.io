What&#39;d I get done this month? Well:</p><ul><li>I have a Kubernetes cluster ready to run all the workloads from my other experiments.</li><li>That cluster is running my blog and associated services, plus some other smaller sites.</li><li>I&#39;ve got deployments all automated and ready to go.</li></ul><span id="continue-reading"></span><p>There is some work left undone, though, of course:</p><ul><li>The cluster isn&#39;t very well hardened yet. I&#39;m pretty close there, though: I really only need to set up an alerting system for policy violations and security events and it&#39;ll be done.</li><li>I&#39;m still running <a href="https://git.bytes.zone">git.bytes.zone</a> on the old infrastructure. I&#39;m giving the few folks who are still using it some time to move their repos off.</li></ul><p>Overall, I feel pretty good about this. I&#39;ve learned a lot and I have something nice to show for it! On to next month!</p></article></div>
