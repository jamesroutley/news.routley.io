<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p><strong>April 2025 4chan Sharty Hack And Janitor Email Leak</strong> refers to the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/soyjakparty">Soyjak.party</a> community&#39;s claimed hacking of 4chan in mid April 2025, which included the restoration of the deleted /QA/ board and leaking the emails of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/4chan">4chan</a> &#34;janitors,&#34; who are members of the site&#39;s moderation team. The attackers reportedly exploited outdated PHP code and deprecated MySQL functions in 4chan&#39;s backend, particularly in a core script named yotsuba.php, which manages post submissions and moderation. A Soyjak.Party users also shared a list of emails they claimed are associated with janitor and moderator accounts, including three .edu emails. Although some <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/cultures/the-internet">internet</a> users claimed that the leaks included .gov emails associated with members of the moderation team, this remains unverified.</p>
<h2 id="origin">Origin</h2>
<p>4chan was reportedly hacked by internet users claiming to be part of the Soyjak.Party community on April 14th, 2025. The hackers brought back the deleted /QA/ board, and temporarily granted access to 4chan&#39;s administrative site. An anonymous user posted about the hack on Soyjak.Party around 10:05 PM EST. The thread contained several bits of leaked information, a look into the /j/ board as well as the entirety of the &#34;yotsuba.php&#34; code, which handles features like posting and reporting. Another post in the thread claimed to be leaking the email addresses associated with various janitors, three of which were .edu emails.</p>
