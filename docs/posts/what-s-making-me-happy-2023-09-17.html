Had a party a general good times.</p>
<p>But in<a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/tag/happy"> #happy</a> links-ville:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/opinion/hip-hop-vinyl.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">Hip-Hop Is the Music of Vinyl Librarians</a> is a fun history and opinion piece.</li>
<li>I loved seeing the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fables-creator-places-wolf-among-us-universe-in-public-domain-amid-clash-with-dc-over-telltale-adaptation">Fables creator place universe in public domain</a>. When it was still coming out, I loved reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fables_(comics)">Fables</a>. Seeing Bill Willingham tell DC that he couldn&#39;t fight the lawsuits, so just put all of his work into public domain was amazing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Didn&#39;t do a lot of other internet reading this week, as we had a bunch of outages at work. But next week I&#39;ll be at <a href="https://www.thestrangeloop.com/index.html">Strange Loop 2023</a>, hit me up if you&#39;ll also be there!</p>
