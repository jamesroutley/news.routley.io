<p>The entire Pebble relaunch would not be complete without revisiting one of our most iconic watches from 2015 - Pebble Time Round. It stole many hearts in the Pebble community and remains the thinnest smartwatch ever made. But at the time we had to make some compromises to fit everything into such a small package. The battery life was a bit shorter than other Pebbles, and the smallish screen was surrounded by a big bezel. It’s time to address those issues!</p>
<h3 id="introducing-pebble-round-2"><a href="#introducing-pebble-round-2"><span>#</span>Introducing Pebble Round 2</a></h3>
<p>Carrying on the tradition of the original PTR, we’ve made improvements in every dimension. No more bezel - a 1.3” color e-paper display covers over the entire face! Thanks to advances in Bluetooth chip technology, the battery life lasts for approximately two weeks. It’s constructed from stainless steel, and comes in 3 colors: matte black, brushed silver and polished rose gold. Best of all, it’s still incredibly thin.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-order Pebble Round 2 today for $199 on</strong> <a href="https://repebble.com/watch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>rePebble.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Shipping begins in May.</p>

<p>Pebble watches are unlike any other smartwatch. Battery life measured in weeks, always-on e-paper screens that reflect rather than emit light and tactile buttons that you can use without needing to glance down.</p>
<p>Everything is powered by fun, quirky and <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/pebbleos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a> PebbleOS. The Pebble <a href="https://repebble.com/app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile app</a> (also <!-- --><a href="https://github.com/coredevices/mobileapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open source</a>) works great with iOS and Android smartphones. You can do basic health and activity tracking (steps, sleep) but it’s not designed to be a fitness or sports watch.<!-- --></p>
<p>Also, check out the Pebble <a href="https://apps.repebble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appstore</a> - it has over 15,000 apps and watchfaces! Or use the <a href="https://developer.repebble.com/sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDK</a> to program your own.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/NaDPMZKXcBU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out the video</a> to see real, fully functional watches. We’ve been working on Round 2 since March! We’re currently in the design verification test (DVT) phase.</p>
<p>We’re announcing this watch now to give folks who pre-ordered a Pebble Time 2 the option to switch their order to a Pebble Round 2 (if you’d like to do that, head over to <a href="https://orders.repebble.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">orders.rePebble.com</a>). We also want to give developers a chance to update their apps to support the larger display (SDK update coming soon!). Finally, since our codebase is fully open source, it’s becoming increasingly hard to keep secrets 😂.</p>
<p>This watch has been a lot easier to build because we’re reusing the electrical design from Pebble Time 2, the mechanical design from Pebble Time Round and open source <a href="https://github.com/coredevices/pebbleos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PebbleOS</a>. We got PebbleOS up and running on it in just a few days!</p>
<h3 id="come-see-us-at-ces"><a href="#come-see-us-at-ces"><span>#</span>Come see us at CES</a></h3>
<p>For the first time ever, Pebble has a booth at CES! If you’re at the show, come visit us at the Venetian Expo, Hall G — 60247 — Eureka Park. Come say hi and check out ALL the new watches and rings. Plus we’ll be giving away t-shirts and stickers!</p>
