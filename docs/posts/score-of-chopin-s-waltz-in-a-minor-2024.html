<p>As reported in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/27/arts/music/chopin-waltz-discovery.html">New
York Times</a>, a Waltz by Chopin, discovered posthumously in 2024,
transcribed by yours truly from the <a href="https://www.themorgan.org/sites/default/files/images/music/pages/452191/452191v_0001.jpg">raw
scan</a> and <a href="https://vp.nyt.com/video/2024/10/15/127974_1_chopin-find-35399_wg_1080p.mp4">Lang-Lang’s
performance</a>.</p>

<p>Very, very obviously a Chopin Waltz. The chord choices, usage of
triplets/mordants, and the suspended pedal tones is characteristic. It’s
a mix of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si5aT6FDPZ0">Prelude
Op 28 no 11</a>’s ephemeral brilliance and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGdpRmL2XUc">Waltz Op 34 no.
2</a>’s lilting, moody style.</p>
<p>My “edition” is not an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urtext_edition">urtext</a>. I added
some phrasing where I thought it was obvious and perhaps went missing
over the ages from the raw scan. The ornamentation in measure 20 was
probably modified by Lang-Lang, but I think it fits the piece better
than a plain mordant, so I notated it as played.</p>
<p>If I were to judge based purely on the music - minus all of the
contextual clues like paper, ink, backstory - the probability of it
being fake is ~10%. I say this only because it is shockingly similar to
34-2 in harmonic and stylistic elements, which is exactly the kind of
thing an AI trained on a not-big-enough dataset would do. While AI
utterly fails at longer pieces, it could plausibly render a coherent
24-measure piece in the style of Chopin, and DeepMind could plausibly be
working in stealth on a really good music-composition AI. But in the
end, the piece is too tightly composed, and I trust NYT’s decision to
trust the historians who are familiar with evaluating such
artifacts.</p>
