      <span>Abstract:</span>  Traditionally, NLP performance improvement has been focused on improving
models and increasing the number of model parameters. NLP vocabulary
construction has remained focused on maximizing the number of words represented
through subword regularization. We present a novel tokenizer that uses
semantics to drive vocabulary construction. The tokenizer includes a trainer
that uses stemming to enhance subword formation. Further optimizations and
adaptations are implemented to minimize the number of words that cannot be
encoded. The encoder is updated to integrate with the trainer. The tokenizer is
implemented as a drop-in replacement for the SentencePiece tokenizer. The new
tokenizer more than doubles the number of wordforms represented in the
vocabulary. The enhanced vocabulary significantly improves NLP model
convergence, and improves quality of word and sentence embeddings. Our
experimental results show top performance on two Glue tasks using BERT-base,
improving on models more than 50X in size.
