            Over the winter holidays, I listened my way through the audiobooks for the entire series, then went out and got myself a hard copy of the first volume. My dad picked it up and didn’t put it down again until he’d finished the
            first book, several hours later.
          </p>
          <p>
            If at all possible, listen to the audiobook version—Kevin R. Free’s narration is perfect. (I also enjoyed
            <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wired.com/story/murderbot-she-wrote-martha-wells/">this recent Martha Wells feature</a>.)

            <strong>The <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/">Universal Paperclips</a> game</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I made the mistake of clicking “Make Paperclip” a couple months ago, promptly got sucked in, and made paperclips until the wee hours of the night.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
            A month or so later, in the process of explaining that situation to my bro-in-law, I pulled the game up to show him—and promptly suckered myself into playing the whole thing all over again.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>
            I thought he’d escaped unscathed…until I received a 4 a.m. text that he’d completed his own playthrough.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>
          </p>
          <p>
            I am intentionally not describing the game itself. If you are even slightly susceptible to addicting activities, do not click “Make Paperclip” unless you have nothing important to be doing for the next several hours. And
            whatever you do, don’t start playing late at night. (h/t <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eieio.games/">NR</a>)

            A charming read about friendship, community, what it means to be a person—and, nominally, football. I was pleased to discover that it is just as engrossing on reread. (I’d recommend reading on desktop rather than phone, if you
            have that option.)
