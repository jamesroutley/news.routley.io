                <p>In <a href="https://nosferalatu.com/DerivativesLogarithmsTransforms.html">a previous post</a> I discussed the relationship between derivatives, logarithms, and transforms. This blog post adds to that and explains how to find the second and higher order derivatives of a transform.</p>
<h3>The Concept of Derivatives of Transforms</h3>
<p>Let’s quickly recap my earlier blog post. Suppose we have a transform <span>\(T\)</span> and a point at the initial position of <span>\(x(0)\)</span>. The position of the point at time t and the first derivative of that point are</p>
<p><span>\(x(t) = T^t * x(0)\)</span></p>
<p><span>\(x&#39;(t) = log(T) * x(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>where <span>\(log(T)\)</span> is the logarithm of the transform. Both <span>\(T\)</span> and <span>\(log(T)\)</span> are constant with respect to t.</p>
<h3>What’s the second derivative?</h3>
<p>We know the first derivative (<span>\(x&#39;(t) = log(T) * x(t)\)</span>), so to find the second derivative, we start with</p>
<p><span>\(\dfrac{d}{dt}x&#39;(t) = \dfrac{d}{dt}log(T) * x(t)\)</span></p>
<p>Since <span>\(log(T)\)</span> is constant with respect to time, we then have</p>
<p><span>\(x&#39;&#39;(t) = log(T) * \dfrac{d}{dt}x(t)\)</span></p>
<p>and earlier we stated that <span>\(x&#39;(t) = log(T) * x(t)\)</span>, so we just plug that in, giving us our answer:</p>
<p><span>\(x&#39;&#39;(t) = log(T) * log(T) * x(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Neat! In other words, if we have the first derivative, then the second derivative is just another multiplication by <span>\(log(T)\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the earlier blog post, we found the tangent vector of a point by multiplying the point by <span>\(log(T)\)</span>. Similarly, we can now find the acceleration vector of a point by multiplying it by <span>\(log(T) * log(T)\)</span>.</p>
<h3>What’s the nth derivative?</h3>
<p>The beauty of this approach is how simple it is. For the nth derivative, we can follow the same pattern. More generally, the nth derivative is</p>
<p><span>\(x^{n}(t) = log(T)^n * x(t)\)</span></p>
<h3>Interactive Example</h3>
<p>Here’s an interactive example where you can see the tangent vector (green arrow) and acceleration vector (red arrow) of a point as it is interpolated from the origin to the gizmo’s transform. You can manipulate the gizmo to translate and rotate the transform. You can also enable a visualization of the velocity vector field or the acceleration vector field.</p>
