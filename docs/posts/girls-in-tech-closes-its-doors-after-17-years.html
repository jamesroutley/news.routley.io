<hr/></div><p>The <a href="https://girlsintech.org/">Girls in Tech </a>nonprofit women’s tech community is closing its doors after 17 years, according to a newsletter from founder <a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/adriana-gascoigne-on-how-girls-in-tech-can-get-women-to-infiltrate-silicon-valley/">Adriana Gascoigne</a>.</p>



<p>Gascoigne said the decision was made with “sadness and devastation” and was not made lightly.</p>



<p>“It is with a heavy heart that I share the news that Girls in Tech will be closing its doors. This decision was not made lightly, and the sadness and devastation we feel cannot be overstated,” Gascoigne wrote. “For 17 incredible years, we have offered a welcoming community based on empowerment, support, and inspiration for women in the tech industry. Together, we have made a profound impact, helping women reach for the stars and excel in their careers, while working tirelessly to eliminate the gender gap in tech worldwide.”</p>

<p>The group reached more than 250,000 individuals across 35 chapters in 30 countries on six continents. It was founded in Silicon Valley, but <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/adriana-gascoigne-why-girls-in-tech-moved-to-nashville/">Gascoigne relocated the group to Nashville</a>, Tennessee, in 2022 during the pandemic. I interviewed her numerous times about the group’s mission and goals, and how it rose to greater relevance in fighting the “<a href="https://venturebeat.com/business/girls-in-techs-adriana-gascoigne-fights-the-toxic-culture-of-silicon-valley/">toxic culture</a>” of Silicon Valley.</p>

The passion to support, uplift, and inspire each other is what has truly set us apart. I am immensely proud of what we have built together and the lasting impact we have made,” Gascoigne said in the newsletter.</p>



<p>The group’s programs included a mentorship program, hackathons, coding bootcamps, the Girls in Tech Conference, a startup challenge, global classroom, podcast, blog, jobs board, and shop. The group organized thousands of in-person and virtual events, producing educational and engaging content. </p>

<p>“To everyone who poured their heart into building this wonderful community where women in tech could have a voice, learn, grow, and be celebrated just as they are—I am profoundly grateful,” Gascoigne said. “A special thanks to all of our members, who established such a friendly, warm, and collaborative environment and culture; the managing directors and advisory board teams who led our chapters; our staff at headquarters who managed and grew the organization; our sponsors who funded our programs and events; and our board of directors.”</p>



<p>Without explanation, Gascoigne said in closing, “Though Girls in Tech is closing its doors, the movement we started must and will continue. I encourage each of you to carry on the fight to eliminate the gender gap in tech. Our mission will live on in other forms, driven by the same passion and commitment that have always defined us. I will miss you all deeply. Thank you for being a part of this incredible journey.”</p>
