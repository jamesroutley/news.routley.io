    <h1>A technical history of Acorn Computers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>These pages contain a fairly brief technical history of Acorn Computers. I have decided to focus on the technology because that is where my interests lie. Only very major non-technical events in Acorn&#39;s history have been included. If anyone finds any inaccuracies in the following pages please contact me using the link at the bottom of the page, including a correction if possible.</p>

  <p>Note that the information on these pages is not an offical history of Acorn&#39;s computers and has no official support from Acorn Computers.</p>

  <p>These pages are under construction. I&#39;m very busy at the moment, but I&#39;m trying to sort these pages out as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>19th April 2004 - a few days late, but never mind... <b><a href="http://www.drobe.co.uk/riscos/artifact1027.html">Happy Birthday, RiscPC!</a></b> (10 years old on the 16th of April.)</p>

  <p>There are some gaps in this history. For example, I know that there was a PocketBook II released by October 1996, but I don&#39;t know how it fits in. Also, I don&#39;t know very much at all about the Acorn Network Computer, Set Top Box 2, Stork or NewsPad, and I can&#39;t remember when the StrongARM was transferred to Intel. I also don&#39;t know very much about the post-Acorn RISC OS machines, the R7500 and the Mico, among others. Any information on any of the reorganisations (in 1995/6 and 1997, I believe) would also be appreciated. If anyone can supply any information, or point me in the direction of some information, please e-mail me using the contact link at the bottom of the page.</p>
