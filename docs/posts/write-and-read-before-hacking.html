          <p>As I grow older, I’ve started appreciating habits and systems more. I don’t subscribe to the cult of hyper productivity, the frequency of posts on this blog  in the past are proof enough. With my current work and family routine, <a href="https://ninad.pundaliks.in/blog/2026/01/blogging-from-phone/">it has been hard</a> to do more. But, as the kiddo grows more independent, I’m finding tiny bits of time for myself. Writing has been in the back of my mind for a while, but I naturally gravitate to tinkering with computers. For the past few weeks, I fixed some stuff on the home server, but wrote very little.</p>

<p>Putting two and two together, I’ve decided to follow a system that a friend from <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>, <a href="https://cceckman.com/">Charles Eckman</a> told me about. He accumulates time writing and publishing posts, before he spends a similar amount of time on his programming ideas. He’s written about it <a href="https://cceckman.com/writing/publish-then-program/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’m gonna spend time writing (mostly for this blog, but once in a while, some other personal stuff) and reading (proper books, not the usual links and content I find while doom scrolling), before I spend time on hacking stuff in my home lab or working on other projects that I’ve cooked up. Here’s hoping that 2026 is more of synthesis, rather than pure devouring of work done by others.</p>
