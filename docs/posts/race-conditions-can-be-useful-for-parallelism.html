    <h1>Race Conditions Can Be Useful for Parallelism</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Many are well aware of the hazards of race conditions. But what about
the benefits?</p>

<p>There are situations where race conditions can be helpful for
performance. By this, I mean that
<strong>you can sometimes make a program faster by <em>creating</em> race conditions</strong>.
Essentially, a small amount of non-determinism can
help eliminate a performance bottleneck.</p>

<p>Now, first, let me emphasize: <strong>I’m not talking about data races</strong>.
Data races are typically bugs, by definition.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>
Instead, I’m talking about how to utilize atomic in-place updates and accesses
(e.g., compare-and-swap, fetch-and-add, etc.) to trade a small amount of
non-determinism for improved performance.</p>

<p>Two interesting examples are
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~blelloch/papers/SBFG13.pdf">priority updates</a> and
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jshun/determ.pdf">deterministic reservations</a>.
Both techniques are able to ensure some degree of determinism, and
yet are non-deterministic “under the hood”. In this post, we’ll look at
priority updates.</p>

<p>It’s important for parallel programmers to be aware of these
techniques for a couple reasons. First, the performance advantages
(for both space and time) are significant. But perhaps more importantly,
these techniques demonstrate that race conditions can be disciplined,
possible to reason about, and useful.</p>

<!-- Familiarizing yourself with this area of algorithm design
forces you to do away with any fears you might have about race conditions.
At a certain point, something clicks, and suddenly, race conditions become
just another thing that you are comfortable reasoning about when trying to
convince yourself that the code you wrote is correct. -->

<!-- If you have ever attempted to design a lock-free or wait-free concurrent
data structure, you are likely aware that there is a whole world of
programming where programmers embrace, rather than eschew, race conditions.
I believe every programmer should at least
become familiar with this area of algorithm and data-structure design. It's
valuable because it forces you to do away with any fears you might have
about race conditions. At a certain point, something clicks, and suddenly,
race conditions become just another thing that you are comfortable reasoning
about when trying to convince yourself that the code you wrote is correct. -->

<!--## Starting Point: Parallel, but not Concurrent-->

<!--It's helpful for this discussion to distinguish parallelism from concurrency.-->

<!--In the world of **concurrent programming**, there are situations where race
conditions are fundamental and unavoidable. For example, if you are developing
an interactive website, then you don't know when a user might press a button.
What happens if the button is pressed before the page finishes loading? That's
a race condition you might have to consider.-->

<!--In contrast, in the world of **parallel programming**, race conditions are
optional. It's possible to write parallel programs which are race-free.
Such programs are entirely deterministic,[^2] making it possible to ignore
parallelism when reasoning about correctness.
"Purely functional" programs are a classic example of this: by
disallowing in-place updates, it's possible to avoid all race conditions by
default.-->

<!--Our starting point here is **race-free parallel programming**, where
correctness does not depend on any race conditions. We'll then show how to
improve performance by introducing races.-->

<h2 id="example-parallel-breadth-first-search-bfs">Example: Parallel Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h2>

<p>It’s helpful to have a motivating example, so let’s consider a
parallel breadth-first search. This algorithm operates in a series of rounds,
where on each round it visits a <strong><em>frontier</em></strong> of vertices
which are all the same distance from the <strong><em>source</em></strong> (the initial vertex). By
selecting the subset of edges which are “used” to traverse the graph, we
derive a <strong><em>BFS tree</em></strong>. In the BFS tree, each vertex points to its
<strong><em>parent</em></strong>, which is a vertex from the previous frontier.</p>

<p>For example, below is a graph with vertices labeled 0 through 9. The second
image shows one possible BFS tree, with frontiers highlighted, starting with
vertex 0 as the source. In this graph, the maximum distance from the source is
3, so there are 4 frontiers (corresponding to distances 0, 1, 2, and 3).</p>



<h2 id="selecting-parents-in-parallel">Selecting Parents in Parallel</h2>

<p>On each round of BFS, we have a frontier of
vertices, and we need to compute the next frontier. To do so, we need to select
a parent for each vertex.</p>

<p>Selecting a parent for each vertex requires care, because for each vertex, there
might be multiple possible parents. For example, in the images above, vertex 3
was selected as the parent of vertex 4, but either vertex 1 and 2 could have
been selected instead.</p>

<p>How should we go about selecting parents? Below, we’ll consider three options:
one which is race-free, one which has race conditions but is significantly
faster, and one which has race conditions but is able to ensure deterministic
output.</p>

<h3 id="slow-approach-collect-potential-parents-and-then-deduplicate">Slow approach: collect potential parents and then deduplicate</h3>

<p>The idea here is to first compute the set of <em>potential parents</em>, and then
select parents from these. The <strong><em>potential parents</em></strong> are a list of
pairs \((v,u)\) where \(u\) could be selected as the parent of \(v\). From
these, we can select parents by “deduplicating”: for any
two pairs \((v, u_1)\) and \((v, u_2)\), we keep one and remove the other
(and continue until there are no duplicates).</p>

<p>One nice thing about this approach is that it is easy to make deterministic.
Deduplication can (for example) be implemented by first
<a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/semisort.pdf">semisorting</a> to put
duplicate pairs in the same bucket, and then by selecting one element from each
bucket. This results in deterministic parent selection in linear work and
polylog depth.</p>

<p>However, one not-so-nice thing about this approach is that <strong>it is slow</strong>,
because it stores the set of potential parents in memory. Across the whole BFS,
every edge will be considered as a potential parent once. Therefore,
constructing the set of potential parents incurs a total of approximately
\(2|E|\) writes to memory for \(|E|\) edges in the input graph. (The factor of
2 is due to representing potential parents as a list of pairs.)</p>

<p>That’s a lot of memory traffic which could be avoided.</p>

<h3 id="faster-approach-deduplicate-on-the-fly">Faster approach: deduplicate “on-the-fly”</h3>

<p>To speed things up, we can do deduplication more eagerly while generating
the set of potential parents. The result is that the set of potential parents
never needs to be fully stored in memory.</p>

<p>We’ll operate on a mutable array, where each cell
of the array stores the parent of a vertex. Initially, these are all “empty”
(using some default value, e.g., <code>-1</code>). To visit a vertex, we set its parent
by performing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare-and-swap</a>,
or CAS for short.</p>

<p>In particular, suppose that vertex \(u\) is a potential parent of \(v\). The
following ML-like pseudocode implements a function
<code>tryVisit(v,u)</code> which attempts to set \(u\) as the parent of \(v\), and returns
<code>true</code> if successful, or <code>false</code> if \(v\) has already been visited. The code
is implemented in terms of a function <code>compareAndSwap(a, i, x, y)</code> which
performs a CAS at <code>a[i]</code>, returning a boolean of whether or not
it successfully swapped from <code>x</code> to <code>y</code>.</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="sml"><span>(*</span><span> Mutable array of parents. `parents[v]` is the parent of `v`,
 * or `-1` if `v` has not yet been visited. *)</span>
<span>val</span> <span>parents</span><span>:</span> <span>vertex</span> <span>array</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span>

<span>(*</span><span> Try to set `u` as the parent of `v`.
 * Returns a boolean indicating success. *)</span>
<span>fun</span> <span>tryVisit</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span><span>u</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>parents</span><span>[</span><span>v</span><span>]</span> <span>==</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span> <span>andalso</span> <span>compareAndSwap</span><span>(</span><span>parents</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>u</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>On one round of BFS, we can then apply <code>tryVisit(v,u)</code> in parallel for every
newly visited vertex \(v\) and each of its potential parents \(u\). This
requires traversing the set of potential parents, but does not require storing
it in memory.</p>

<p>This performs one compare-and-swap per edge. Assuming relatively low contention,
this requires only approximately \(|V|\) memory updates in total (where \(|V|\)
is the number of vertices) across the whole BFS: for each vertex, there will be
one successful CAS. That is a significant improvement over the \(2|E|\) updates
required for the slower approach.</p>

<p><strong>Non-determinism</strong>. This approach ensures that some parent is selected for each
vertex, but doesn’t ensure that the same parent will be selected every
time. Therefore, the final output of the BFS, while always correct, could be
different on each execution. (There are many valid BFS trees for any graph,
and the above algorithm selects one of them non-deterministically.)</p>

<p>Regardless of non-determinism, we can still argue that this code is correct.
There is a race condition to reason about: any two
calls <code>tryVisit(v,u1)</code> and <code>tryVisit(v,u2)</code>
will race to update the value <code>parents[v]</code>.
Abstractly, each value <code>parents[v]</code> has only two possible states: either
“empty” (i.e., <code>-1</code>), or set with a valid parent. If a CAS
succeeds, then the resulting value <code>parents[v]</code> is valid and will never change.
If a CAS fails, then another CAS on the same cell must have succeeded.</p>

<h3 id="making-it-deterministic-with-priority-updates">Making it deterministic with priority updates</h3>

<p>To make the above approach deterministic, we can use
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~blelloch/papers/SBFG13.pdf">priority updates</a>.
The idea is to select the “best” parent on-the-fly using CAS. We’ll
say that a parent \(u_1\) is “better than” some other parent \(u_2\) if
\(u_1 &gt; u_2\) (relying on numeric labels for vertices). So, in other words,
we want to compute the maximum parent for each vertex.</p>

<p>Here’s some pseudocode. Again, we use a mutable array
<code>parents</code> where <code>parents[v]</code> is the parent of <code>v</code>, or <code>-1</code> if it has not
yet been visited. We additionally need a second mutable array, <code>visited</code>,
where <code>visited[v]</code> is a boolean indicating whether or not a vertex has
been visited yet. This ensure that we only update the parents of unvisited
vertices. At the end of each round, the visited flags for the new frontier
need to be updated.</p>

<figure>
  <pre><code data-lang="sml"><span>val</span> <span>parents</span><span>:</span> <span>vertex</span> <span>array</span> <span>=</span> <span>...</span> <span>(*</span><span> same as before *)</span>

  <span>end</span></code></pre>
</figure>

<p>We apply <code>priorityUpdateParent(v,u)</code> in parallel for every
to-be-visited vertex \(v\) and each of its potential parents \(u\). This
requires traversing all potential parents, but does not require storing
them in memory. (For more details, see the full code below.)
When this completes, the “best” parent (i.e., the one with
largest numeric label) will have been selected for each vertex.
<strong>Therefore, the output is deterministic.</strong></p>

<p>Note that, although this produces deterministic output, the algorithm itself
is non-deterministic. There is a race condition to reason about: any two
contending calls <code>priorityUpdateParent(v,u1)</code> and <code>priorityUpdateParent(v,u2)</code>
will race to update the value <code>parents[v]</code>.</p>

<p><strong>To argue correctness</strong>, consider that each value <code>parents[v]</code>
increases monotonically with each successful CAS. With this observation,
it’s not too difficult to brute force through all
possible interleavings of loads and CAS operations to see that the code is
correct. Essentially, each call to <code>priorityUpdateParent</code> has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearizability">linearization point</a>
at the moment it performs a successful CAS. At this linearization point,
the state of the cell increases monotonically. After all calls complete, the
final value of the cell is the maximum.</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with this kind of reasoning,
I would highly encourage spending an hour or two working through it!</p>

<p><strong>Cost</strong>. How many memory updates does this approach require? That is a really
interesting question, and the answer is not so straightforward.
In their <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~blelloch/papers/SBFG13.pdf">paper</a>,
Shun et al. consider multiple reasonable models and argue that for \(n\)
contending priority updates, we can expect approximately \(O(\log n)\)
successful CAS operations. In the context of BFS, the variable \(n\)
corresponds to the
maximum degree of a vertex, as this will be the maximum number of contending
priority updates. Therefore, the total number of memory updates in
this approach will be approximately \(|V| \log \delta\), where \(\delta\) is
the maximum degree of any vertex. Not bad!</p>

<p>Below is the code for a deterministic parallel breadth-first search using
priority updates to select parents. It’s written in a mostly functional style,
using standard
data-parallel functions like <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>flatten</code>, etc., as well
compare-and-swap operations to implement the priority update. This code
is similar to Parallel ML, which we could compile and run with
the <a href="https://github.com/MPLLang/mpl"><code>mpl</code></a> compiler.</p>

<p>The function <code>breadthFirstSearch(G,s)</code> performs a
breadth-first search of graph <code>G</code>, starting from a vertex <code>s</code>.
We assume vertices are integers, labeled <code>0</code> to <code>N-1</code>. The search returns an
array of parents, with one parent for each vertex. In the array of parents, a
value of <code>-1</code> is used to mark unvisited vertices (i.e., vertices without a
parent). This way, the array of parents serves two purposes: it will be the
output, but also, it is used to indicate which vertices have been visited.</p>

<p>BFS begins by allocating the array of parents, initializing with <code>-1</code> for
each vertex, indicating that no vertices have been visited yet. The BFS then
proceeds in a series of rounds, where each round takes as argument the
<em>frontier</em> of the previous round. We then compute the next frontier by
selecting parents as described above.</p>

<p>The BFS terminates as soon as the current frontier is empty, which occurs as
soon as all vertices reachable from the source have been visited.</p>

<h2 id="some-timings">Some Timings</h2>

<p>Below are timings collected from the
<a href="https://github.com/MPLLang/parallel-ml-bench">Parallel ML Benchmark Suite</a>
for the three BFS strategies discussed here. These three strategies vary
in their level of determinism: one is fully deterministic, one is partially
deterministic (i.e. deterministic output but not non-deterministic execution),
and one is completely non-deterministic.</p>

<p>The table shows timings on \(P = 1\) and \(P = 72\) processors, and speedups
relative to a baseline 1-processor time. The speedup is computed as
\(T_{72} / B\), where \(T_{72}\) is the time on 72 processors and \(B\) is the
baseline; in this case, we use the fastest 1-processor time as the baseline.
The input is a randomly generated power-law graph, with approximately
16.8M vertices and 199M edges, symmetrized.</p>

<p>We can see here that the fastest approach is the fully
non-deterministic strategy. Not far behind (~20% slower) is the approach
based on deterministic priority updates. And, by far, the slowest approach
is the fully deterministic strategy. The additional cost for the fully
deterministic strategy is due to high memory pressure, to write out all
potential parents before duplicating.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>In cases where non-determinism is acceptable,
the results above demonstrate that race conditions can be useful for
improving performance. But this improved performance comes with the tradeoff:
racy code is more difficult to debug and prove correct.</p>

<p>In my experience, with a bit of practice, reasoning about race conditions
can become familiar and comfortable. It’s especially helpful to acquire a
repertoire of familiar techniques. Knowing just a few
techniques is sufficient for understanding a wide variety of sophisticated,
state-of-the-art parallel algorithms. Priority updates are a great place to get
started.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in learning more, consider reading about
<a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jshun/determ.pdf">deterministic reservations</a>, a
technique for parallelizing incremental sequential algorithms. The resulting
algorithms are parallel, with deterministic output, but non-deterministic
execution. The technique is surprisingly powerful.</p>
