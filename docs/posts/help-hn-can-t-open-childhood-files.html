    <h1>Help HN: Can&#39;t Open Childhood Files</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>Hello HN,
I was clearing my old house and got a box with a 100+ 3Â½ floppy disks. All except one working!<p>Among others I got DisplayWriter 4.0, OS/4 Warp Slovenian, dBase IV, Clipper, PowerPoint 4.0, Netscape Navigator 3.0, etc.</p><p>I found also some files with .CHT and .IMG extension which I can&#39;t find any software to open them. I know I made them, but unfortunately I can&#39;t remember which software was used. There is my family tree and chart of my height growing (which I&#39;d like to compare now with my kids).</p><p>Some files I uploaded here: https://github.com/twooclock/KdajBi/tree/main/cht_img
Files timestamp is 1990 and 1991.</p><p>Please help me find appropriate software!</p><p>So far I tried (does not work):
-ABC Flowcharter 3.01
-IBM Storyboard Plus 1.01 (5.25)
-Harvard Graphics for Windows 4.0
-Harvard Graphics for Windows 2.0 (3.5)
-HarvardGraphicsViewer
-PowerPoint 98</p><p>Googled, checked file.org, WinWorld, ... loosing hope... really makes me think about digital preservation.</p><p>Thank you!</p></td></div></div>
