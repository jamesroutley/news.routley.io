Haruhiko Kuroda reiterated on Thursday a pledge to maintain monetary stimulus to support a fragile economy facing still weak inflation and reeling from the COVID downturn.</p><p>Kuroda has argued that global commodity costs account for half the factors for price hikes and that cost-push inflation would not last long.</p><p>Japan&#39;s consumer inflation would likely reach 3% for the current fiscal year end to next March, but the pace would fall to half that rate next year as commodity and other cost-push factors run their course, Kuroda has said.</p><p>In a sign subcontractors are struggling with wholesale price pressures, the corporate goods price index (CGPI) jumped 9.1% in the year to October.</p></div></div></div></div>
