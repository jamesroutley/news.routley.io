				<p id="speakable-summary">Tesla is recalling all 3,878 Cybertrucks that it has shipped to date, due to a problem where the accelerator pedal can get stuck, putting drivers at risk of a crash, <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2024/TESLA/CYBERTRUCK#recalls" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according</a> to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.</p>
<p>The recall caps a tumultuous week for Tesla. The company laid off more than 10% of its workforce on Monday, and lost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/15/tesla-layoffs-workers-sales-cybertruck-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two of its highest-ranking executives</a>. A few days later, Tesla asked shareholders to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/17/tesla-x-advertising-musk-stock-package-delware-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">re-vote</a> on CEO Elon Musk’s massive compensation package that was struck down by a judge earlier this year.</p>
<p>Reports of problems with the Cybertruck’s accelerator pedal <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/716031/tesla-cybertruck-stuck-accelerator-pedal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a60512399/tesla-cybertruck-stuck-pedal-nhtsa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">popping</a> up in the last few weeks. Tesla even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24131237/tesla-delivery-delay-accelerator-pedal-stuck" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly paused deliveries</a> of the truck while it sorted out the issue. Musk said in a post on X that Tesla was “being very cautious” and the company reported to NHTSA that it was not aware of any crashes or injuries related to the problem.</p>
<p>The company has now confirmed to NHTSA that the pedal can dislodge, making it possible for it to slide up and get caught in the trim around the footwell.</p>
<p>Tesla said it first received a notice of one of these accelerator pedal incidents from a customer on March 31, and then a second one on April 3. After performing a series of tests, it decided on April 12 to issue a recall after determining that an “[a]n unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component assembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal,” and that “[r]esidual lubricant reduced the retention of the pad to the pedal.”</p>
<p>Tesla says it will replace or rework the accelerator pedal on all existing Cybertrucks. It also told NHTSA that it has started building Cybertrucks with a new accelerator pedal, and that it’s fixing the vehicles that are in transit or sitting at delivery centers.</p>
<p>While the Cybertruck only first started shipping late last year, this is not the vehicle’s first recall. But the initial one was minor: Earlier this year, Tesla recalled the software on all of its vehicles because the font sizes of its warning lights <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/recalls/2024/02/02/tesla-recall-font-size-warning-lights/72447967007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were too small</a>. The company first unveiled the truck <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/21/behold-the-tesla-cybertruck-is-here/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in 2019</a>.</p>
