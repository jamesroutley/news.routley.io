    <p>An update on <a href="https://karthikbalakrishnan.com/blog/hex-project">our community space plans</a>.</p>

<p><strong>We need to make 2.5L a month to safely cover all our monthly costs.</strong> This is a bit of uncharted territory for me personally, given all the previous projects have been somewhat within my disposal income to not have to think about needing to make ends meet. That said, <a href="https://reroll.in">ReRoll Board Games</a> has been making a small profit for years that we use to buy new games.</p>

<p>With a commercial space there are near-infinite ways to try and make rent, but we want to focus on ones that line up our with our goals of being a space for communities that we want to see grow. Anything that deviates from this feels like a slippery slope that ends in becoming another co-working space in Indiranagar.</p>

<p>That said, it’s not always possible for communities to bare the cost of the underlying space and time - otherwise everyone would have their own venue. Atleast with a cafe or pub the venue is making money from the attendees - but we are decided not interested in F&amp;B. This whole project only really works if we can find ways to subside our costs by making up the money elsewhere, so here’s the plan.</p>

<p>The most straightforward avenue for this initially is to do corporate/private board game events for companies and groups. We’ll package a few hours of games with some outsourced catering at the space. We’ll do our the hosting, teaching of games, etc. If we can do 3-4 of these a month at a decent price point, say 30-40k for 40 people for 2-3 hours, we’ll find ourselves in a more comfortable position. Over the years we’ve had a companies reach out to ask us to do a private event, but we’ve usually said no because of the logistical hassle. With our own space we can give better value while also making it easier for us operationally.</p>

<p><strong>If you’d like to have your company or private friend group over to play games, please <a href="https://karthikbalakrishnan.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b3d8d2c1c7dbdad8d1808682f3d4ded2dadf9dd0dcde">get in touch</a>.</strong></p>

<p>We’re also exploring if there is any value we can give for someone to sponsor a particular community that we host. A majority of existing ones usually lean towards F&amp;B venues, so a bit unsure of this. This will depend a lot on what kind of regular events we do - we think something like chess, jigsaw puzzles, or even board games can be viable to find a sponsor for.</p>

<p>We’d be silly to not take up well-wishers who want to help support this venue directly. I think once we have a floorplan/layout I’d be more comfortable having this conversation since I’d like people to have a better idea of they are supporting, rather than just relying on our personal social capital. We’re very fortunate to be in a place to even have this option.</p>

<p>Lastly, we’ll always have direct ticketing revenue. We want events to be paid, as we’ve found that it makes the incentives for the community and the organiser line up. In our experience, being transparent about what things cost and how it’s priced go a really long way in how people feel about it. For example, we’ve had very few complaints when we increased our Tabletop Thursday tickets from 200 to 300, despite there not being a cafe <a href="https://forum.reroll.in/t/tabletop-thursdays-are-changing-a-bit/1206#pricing-changes-2">because we explained the reasoning</a> and made sure that it was available to read before customers bought a ticket. This is definitely achievable and is fundamental to the long-term success of this venue.</p>

<p>We have a bunch of other ideas at various levels of realised - from a decked-out TRPG room that people can use to run their campaigns to doing intimate acoustic gigs - but more on those later.</p>
