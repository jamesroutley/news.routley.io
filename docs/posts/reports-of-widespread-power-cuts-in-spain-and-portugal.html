They luckily have a gas-powered barbecue, so friends and neighbours are coming over tonight with all their perishables and they plan on cooking everything.</p><p>The blackout started around 11:50 local time (10:50 BST), Cara adds, and while phones were initially fine, the 5G networks are only working intermittently now and the lines went down fully for some time as well. </p></article></div></div></li><li><div><div><article data-testid="content-post" id="asset:a040c563-904d-41eb-b137-8494bdf023e1"><header><span><h3 type="normal"><span role="text"><span>Spanish PM news conference delayed</span><span><span data-testid="timestamp"><span data-testid="accessible-timestamp">published at 16:46 British Summer Time</span><p><span aria-hidden="true">16:46 BST</span></p></span></span></span></h3></span></header><p>We were expecting to hear from Spain&#39;s Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez about the power cut a while ago - at 17:15 local time (16:15 BST) - but the news conference is yet to start.</p><p>We&#39;ll bring you the latest lines from him as soon as we have them.</p></article></div></div></li><li><div><div><article data-testid="content-post" id="asset:e61d29e8-45e8-420b-8aa0-e3b2759554c9"><header><span><h3 type="normal"><span role="text"><span>Spain&#39;s nuclear reactors in safe condition, says safety council</span><span><span data-testid="timestamp"><span data-testid="accessible-timestamp">published at 16:37 British Summer Time</span><p><span aria-hidden="true">16:37 BST</span></p></span></span></span></h3></span></header><p>Spain&#39;s nuclear reactors are in &#34;safe condition&#34;
