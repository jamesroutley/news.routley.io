            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> studio id Software are now home to a &#34;wall-to-wall&#34; union according to the Communications Workers of America (CWA). The organisation have announced that a group of 165 id workers have just voted to unionise, adding to the ranks of the 300 ZeniMax quality assurance staff who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">unionised back in 2023</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the CWA&#39;s press release, Microsoft have already recognised this latest union - which is made up of &#34;developers, artists, programmers, and more&#34; - in accordance with the <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/">labour neutrality agreement</a> the two parties agreed in 2022.</p>
<p>&#34;The wall-to-wall organizing effort at id Software was much needed; it’s incredibly important that developers across the industry unite to push back on all the unilateral workplace changes that are being handed down from industry executives,&#34; said id Software producer and CWA organising committee member Andrew Willis.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, id lead services programmer and CWA committee member Chris Hays specifically cited remote staff not being dragged into the office as a reason behind the push for representation. &#34;Remote work isn’t a perk,&#34; he said. &#34;It’s a necessity for our health, our families, and our access needs. RTO policies should not be handed down from executives with no consideration for accessibility or our well-being.&#34;</p><p>The CWA release also cited &#34;<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass industry layoffs</a>, sudden periods of crunch time, and unfair pay&#34; as part of the impetus behind a wider push towards unionisation among devs across the industry this year, adding that the total of unionised workers across Microsoft&#39;s fiefdom is now &#34;nearly 4,000&#34; strong.</p>
<p>CWA president Ron Swaggerty added that the union &#34;look forward to sitting across the table from Microsoft to negotiate a contract that reflects the skill, creativity, and dedication these workers bring to every project.&#34;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, members of the &#34;industry-wide union&#34; <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-games-industry-is-broken-say-the-cwa-so-theyre-building-an-industry-wide-union">the CWA announced</a> earlier this year <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1999257505751532008">held a protest</a> outside of The Game Awards yesterday, with their aim being to &#34;to acknowledge the video games and studios that have been closed and to also condemn the creativity that’s been crushed by corporate greed and studio executives&#34;.
</p>
<p>Solidarity to these id Software workers.</p>
