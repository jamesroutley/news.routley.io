    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-27324"><ul><li><em>New ThinkPad™ L14</em><em> i Gen 5, L16 i Gen 1, L13 Gen 5, L13 2-in-1 Gen 5, X13 Gen 5 and X13 2-in-1 Gen 5 featuring Intel® Core® Ultra™ processors with Intel vPro® are AI PCs ready to take AI workflows to the next level</em></li><li><em>ThinkPad L14 Gen 5 and L16 Gen 1 available with AMD Ryzen™ PRO 7030 Series Processors</em></li></ul><p><strong>March 19, 2024 </strong><strong>– </strong>Today, Lenovo<em>™</em> launched its latest business laptop offerings in the form of the <strong>ThinkPad<em>™</em> L series</strong> and <strong>ThinkPad X13 series</strong>. The new laptops are a testament to Lenovo’s commitment to innovation and sustainability with features such as enhanced repairability, more recycled materials, efficient power management, and powerful processing capabilities with built-in security and manageability. With these offerings, Lenovo is not only showcasing its technological expertise but also its dedication to supporting a diverse customer base in achieving success across many business segments.</p><p>Lenovo’s latest ThinkPad L series and X13 series with multiple advancements geared towards enhancing user experience. The new models offer several form factors – including 13-inch or 13-inch 2-in-1, 14-inch and introducing new 16-inch displays in ThinkPad L16 – catering to those in need of portability without compromising performance. Equipped with an optional higher resolution 5MP camera, users can expect enhanced video conferencing and content creation capabilities.

Improvements in rear vent thermals ensure efficient cooling for prolonged usage, while select models offer support for up to Wi-Fi 7 and 4G LTE or 5G sub6 on select models<sup>2</sup>, enhancing connectivity options. Powered by <strong>Intel<em>®</em> Core<em>®</em> Ultra<em>™</em></strong> processors with <strong>Intel vPro<em>®</em></strong> or <strong>AMD Ryzen<em>™</em> PRO 7030 Series</strong> processors on ThinkPad L14 Gen 5 and L16 Gen 1, these new laptops are designed to optimally run Windows 11 and are poised to elevate productivity and streamline professional tasks.</p><p><strong>Sustainability and Accessibility Beyond Materials</strong></p><p>Next-generation business laptops are required to provide enhanced user experiences while also making strides towards improving their impact on a circular economy. To help Lenovo towards reducing emissions and help customers with their own sustainability goals, Lenovo has made significant progress in this area through the <a href="https://techtoday.lenovo.com/us/en/sustainability-solutions">development</a> of innovative supply chains, services, product designs, and materials, allowing them to transition towards a circular model of “design, use, return, re-use.” The latest ThinkPad laptops from Lenovo further embody this commitment by enhancing repairability<sup>3</sup> to help reduce electronic waste, offering new technology from 3M<sup>4</sup> that improves display brightness while reducing power consumption, and incorporating new tactile markings for a more inclusive customer experience.</p><p>Created in 2020, the <strong>Lenovo Product Diversity Office</strong> (PDO) seeks to implement a Diversity by Design review board and introduce checkpoints to Lenovo’s product planning, development, and execution phases, which certifies that our solutions are both inclusive and accessible.  Lenovo’s PDO works closely with multiple user groups, including the <a href="https://youtu.be/hw6u54INM_U?si=bZ0EvRUzCFknoGZx">Governor Morehead School</a> for the Blind to enhance understanding of PC interactions with blind and low vision users. Lenovo, in collaboration with Microsoft’s Accessibility team, incorporated new tactile cues for increased accessibility in keyboard design, setting new industry standards. These new markings are now integrated into new design ThinkPad models in 2024<sup>5</sup>.</p><figure id="attachment_27325" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-27325"><a href="https://news.lenovo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/05_Keyboard_Accessibility.png"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" alt="" width="1024" height="768" data-srcset="https://news.lenovo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/05_Keyboard_Accessibility-1024x768.png 1024w, https://news.lenovo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/05_Keyboard_Accessibility-600x450.png 600w, https://news.lenovo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/05_Keyboard_Accessibility-768x576.png 768w, https://news.lenovo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/05_Keyboard_Accessibility-1536x1152.png 1536w, https://news.lenovo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/05_Keyboard_Accessibility.png 2000w" data-src="https://news.lenovo.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/05_Keyboard_Accessibility-1024x768.png" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="/></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-27325"><em>ThinkPad L16 Gen 5 tactile key markings</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lenovo’s recently announced ThinkPad T14 Gen 5, T14s Gen 5, and ThinkPad L14 Gen 5 announcing today are equipped with the cutting-edge <strong>3M Optical Film solution</strong> built using DBEF5 technology in select displays of the 14-inch laptops.
