    <h1>What To Think When Looking at a Chart</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2023/05/how_to_read_chart.jpg" alt="What To Think When Looking at a Chart"><p><em>Note: this is Part 6 in a <a href="https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/">series of blog posts about becoming data driven in business</a>. You may want to read the prior parts before reading this essay.</em></p><p>At this point in the <a href="https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/">Becoming Data Driven Series</a> we&#x2019;ve covered a bunch of big ideas. Those ideas are starting to become a bit unwieldy. I promise you that I&#x2019;ll bring everything together at the end of the series &#x2014; unwieldy ideas aren&#x2019;t as useful as distilled, simple ones, and long time readers should know that I care about being useful above all.</p><p>This essay is going to be one of the simpler ones. I want to focus on a really basic, really dumb question, which is implied in nearly all the previous posts in the series, but never discussed explicitly. The trigger for this essay was really a presentation I gave at Holistics (a company that I consult for) a few weeks ago, which summarised everything that we&#x2019;ve covered in the series so far. You&#x2019;ll see slides interspersed with the text below.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s the question that I want to answer today: &#x201C;In a business context, <em>what should I think when I&#x2019;m looking at a chart?</em>&#x201D;</p>
