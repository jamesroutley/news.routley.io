    <h1>The new .zip TLD is going to cause some problems</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>Many years ago, Google applied for the <code>.zip</code> Top Level Domain. ICANN, in its infinite wisdom, granted it. And now, I think, bad things are going to happen.</p><p>You see computers <em>try</em> to be helpful. They see you wrote &#34;visit example.com&#34; and autolink the thing which looks like a domain name. That&#39;s handy - especially as most people don&#39;t have the time or skill to write HTML.</p><p>So what happens when things which are <em>not</em> domain names look like they are domain names? I&#39;ve been worrying about this for a few years:</p><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Grrr... Because .zip is a valid TLD, it&#39;s impossible to know whether <a href="http://t.co/webB2l1Y9w">http://t.co/webB2l1Y9w</a> should be a URL or a filename.</p><p>— Terence Eden (@edent) <a href="https://twitter.com/edent/status/567820810371735553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2015</a></p></blockquote><p>Right now there is an old tweet, blog, email, or instant message from an authority figure which points to a non-existent .zip domain.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/people-of-Twitter-talking-about-photos.zip-there-are-lots-of-them.png" alt="people of Twitter talking about photos.zip there are lots of them." width="748" height="777"/></p><p>Is that domain available to buy? Well, <a href="https://www.registry.google/tlds/tech/">let&#39;s look at Google&#39;s Domain Availability site</a></p><p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-how-exciting-photos.zip-is-available.png" alt="Screenshot how exciting photos.zip is available." width="860" height="508"/></p><p><small>(No, I don&#39;t know where the missing &#34;T&#34; is either.)</small></p><p>Yup! OK, premium domains like <code>photos.zip</code> appear to be about £1,000 - which should put off some scammers. But the price for non-premium .zips is between £10-£30.</p><p>Look, I doubt a former president ever Tweeted &#34;Hey, anyone know how I extract files from something called <a href="https://blah.zip">blah.zip</a> on a Mac?&#34; but I&#39;ll bet you that something, somewhere, is going to be abused with this new TLD.</p><p>I feel like a curmudgeonly old fart. Don&#39;t we have <em>enough</em> TLDs? What&#39;s the limit?  There are very few meaningful controls on who can register all but the most retrictive TLDs (looking at you, <code>.int</code>!)  So at what point do we just give up and same everyone can have their own Top Level?</p><p>Anyway, have fun determining if the link you see was ever intended to link to a website!</p></div></article></div>
