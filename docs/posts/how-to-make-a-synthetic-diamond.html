    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section id="intro" data-stepid="SYV9IPJFSUUXMU4"><h2>Introduction: How to Make a Synthetic Diamond</h2><p>My 10-year Wedding Anniversary is coming up so I thought I&#39;d make my wife something special. A few months back I&#39;d seen a show on TV where they demonstrated how companies were now making &#34;cultured&#34; diamonds in the lab. There are a few different methods, but the simplest is something called &#34;chemical vapor distillation&#34;. The process is pretty straightforward. Basically, microwaves are used to create a slurry of graphite plasma which, when rapidly cooled form a crystal structure.</p></section><section id="step1" data-stepid="SJV59DRFSUUXMYG"><h2>Step 1: Materials</h2><p>Here&#39;s the surprisingly short list of materials I used:</p></section><section id="step2" data-stepid="SSRQDU3FSUUXN1D"><h2>Step 2: Prepare the Olive Oil</h2><p>As I mentioned above, the theory behind this project is using microwaves to heat the graphite into a plasma. In general, pencil graphite is not reactive enough to microwaves. So, a thin oil is used to concentrate the heat in a specific area of the graphite. Also, as the oil heats up and begins to burn, it chemically separates the binder in the pencil lead from the graphite.</p></section><section id="step3" data-stepid="SRTIKAQFSUUXN3R"><h2>Step 3: Transfer Oil to the Graphite</h2><p>Lift the oily thread and tie a knot in it.</p></section><section id="step4" data-stepid="SIEV8RJFSUUXN66"><h2>Step 4: Setup (i.e. Clean) the Microwave Oven</h2><p>I didn&#39;t really tell my wife what I was up to. (It is, after all, a surprise.) But when she saw that it involved our microwave, her response was, &#34;please don&#39;t burn the house down.&#34;</p></section><section id="step5" data-stepid="SGAN14JFSUUXN8U"><h2>Step 5: Remove the Thread</h2><p>Clip off part of the thread as close to graphite as possible. Then, gently tug on the other end of the thread and pull the knot undone.</p></section><section id="step6" data-stepid="S0KKUVPFSUUXNAP"><h2>Step 6: Set the Graphite on the &amp;quot;Crucible&amp;quot;</h2><p>Here&#39;s the ingenious part of the project. Turn one of the coffee mugs upside-down. (I used a slightly larger one as the base.)</p></section><section id="step7" data-stepid="S2A7Y4EFSUUXNDN"><h2>Step 7: Place &amp;quot;Crucible&amp;quot; in Microwave</h2><p>Place the stacked mugs into the microwave. In my setup, the large bottom mug required that I remove the glass tray.<br/></p></section><section id="step8" data-stepid="SJOUIDQFSUUXNEX"><h2>Step 8: Start the Microwave</h2><p>Set the microwave for its maximum cook time at the maximum power setting. In my case, that was 99 minutes and 99 seconds - which turned out to be long enough.
</p></section><section id="step9" data-stepid="SM2TX1AFSUUXNG0"><h2>Step 9: Admire the Finished Product</h2><p>After the mugs have completely cooled, remove them from the microwave.
</p></section><section id="step10" data-stepid="S0IHEAFFSSIV2ML"><h2>Step 10: Make It Into a Keepsake</h2><p>Obviously, this falls a bit short of what we think of when we hear &#34;diamond&#34;. But, after posting the original article, I came up with a pretty cool way to preserve my achievement.</p></section></div></div>
