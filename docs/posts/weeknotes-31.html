<li>long time no weeknotes! how are you doing? i&#39;m much better. thanks for asking, and returning to gaze upon these.</li>
<li>one of my friends was joking about being included in these and i always find it funny that people notice or don&#39;t notice that the notes are going out. the notes must go through! i&#39;m thrilled about that i think? i thought it was a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/srs111tqxSQ">the pressure is getting worser</a>” situation but turns out i&#39;ve been struggling for other reasons.</li>
<li>i have actually been struggling to write these as unlike some people i don&#39;t want to just write about work (obviously) or too much, too directly about people in my personal life (less obvious i think?). and it&#39;s been a very people-y couple of weeks so didn&#39;t have much in my head for here? I&#39;m trying to take more little notes during the week over on <a href="https://notes.olu.online">the notes blog</a>, but it&#39;s hard going, and i need to incentivise myself more to actually do it. i love posting, i love writing, why am i not doing both more? it is a mystery.</li>
<li>i am trying tidal and i do not like it, so i will probably swap back to spotify after the trial sadly. why does it not have a desktop app? I am doing a lot of boycotts anyway, and i&#39;m looking forward to <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/mood-machine-the-rise-of-spotify-and-the-cost-of-the-perfect-playlist-liz-pelly">mood machine</a> being released in the UK to see if it has more of a way forward plotted out. i no longer strive for perfect moral purity (it&#39;s a bit of my madness that still makes perfect sense to me, but i know logically is not compatible with life lol) but i do try to be curious about why i am or am not doing a thing that people around me think is important. can i articulate it to myself? can i revisit this decision? do the stakes feel high enough? this and other questions help a lot.</li>
<li>i&#39;m so excited that everyone is watching severance together, one of the few shows that grabbed me straight away. i&#39;m still a bit confused why having a cool outie would help, but all the memes have shown me having a bad one would definitely be terrible. poor helly!</li>
<li>i still think i probably shouldn&#39;t be using footnotes accessibility wise, but i can&#39;t see the details tags i put in on my posts so i assume something broke with those, i should investigate. i shall put it on the list.</li>
<li>i&#39;ve really been enjoying smash burgers, bean burgers, mushroom lasagna, and may chang and bog myrtle essential oil scented things.</li>
<li>i&#39;m slowly working on a piece about <a href="https://notes.olu.online/leaving">leaving social media</a>, leave a comment, email me, i want thoughts!</li>
<li>i really want to weight lift, but the world is conspiring against me, the nearest bougie gym has a three-month cancellation policy after the first month and i don&#39;t want to have to keep paying it if i&#39;m not here, it costs too much! might have complained about that last time. the non-bougie gyms i will just not go to; i should probably do a recce of the absolute nearest but i think if it&#39;s busy i just won&#39;t do it.</li>
<li>on the lookout for cute, flat foot pain friendly, cute, affordable. cute shoes lol. i have high hopes for a pair of vans i ordered and i hope the next size up fit nice!</li>
<li>my quarterly goals are going rubbish if i was going off strict adherence lol. i also need to have another look at my bingo cards and list of <a href="https://olu.online/25-hopes-for-2025">hopes</a>, but the year is going differently to how i anticipated so far.</li>
<li>saw nosferatu, it was so good but everyone saying it&#39;s about her longing for him (positively) is a freak (derogatory). i am not a critic, “i am an appetite”, so take of that what you will.</li>
<li>do you want a newsletter from me? let me know if so, i think i could do it now but i need validation.</li>
<li>see you next week time! hope you&#39;re having a great week :)</li>
