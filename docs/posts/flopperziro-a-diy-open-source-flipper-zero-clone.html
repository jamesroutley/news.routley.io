    <p>The general intensifier <em>really</em> arrived at its current meaning around 1561. The word in its original meaning of “actually”, from <em>real</em> + <em>-ly</em>, is attested from the 1450s. <em>Real</em> is one of the many words borrowed into English from Norman French in the 1300s, in this case from <em>reel</em>, meaning “actual”. <em>Reel</em> descends straightforwardly from Latin <em>reālis</em>, also meaning “actual”, which derives from earlier Latin <em>rēs</em>, meaning “thing” or “matter”.</p>

<p><em>Really</em>’s gradual shift from meaning “actually” to meaning “very” is surprisingly precedented! The “actually” sense of <em>truly</em> (Old English <em>trēowe</em>, meaning “true”) goes back over a thousand years, but its recent meaning shift toward “very” is not even acknowledged by the OED yet. (It is acknowledged in the other dictionaries I checked.) Even the canonical general intensifier <em>very</em> (Latin <em>vērus</em>, meaning “true”) shifts in meaning from “actually” in 1200-1500 to, uh, “very” after 1550. <em>Literally</em> (Latin <em>littera</em>, meaning “letter”) in the process of shifting from “actually” to “very” is in very good company.</p>
