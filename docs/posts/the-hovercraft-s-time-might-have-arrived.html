But when a massive and popular hovercraft that transported people and their cars between England and France retired in 2000, many felt the final curtain had fallen on a technology that hadn&#39;t really delivered on all the hype.

Close to half the length of The Princess Anne, it&#39;s Griffon&#39;s latest example of a new generation of quieter, more fuel-efficient hovercrafts under construction.

There were people playing with this concept for a long time.&#34;<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>The era of the eccentric hovercraft inventor isn&#39;t over yet. The first hovercraft race was in Canberra, Australia in 1964 but racing â€“ and cruising â€“ hovercrafts continues to be popular. Competitors are often innovators who work on their vehicles in their garden sheds and garages.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Racing is how my parents met â€“ and I&#39;ve been going since I was born,&#34; says Hannah Deacon, marketing director of the <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hovercraft.org.uk/">Hovercraft Club of Great Britain (HCGB),<!-- --></a> and runner-up in the 2022 Formula 50 World Hovercraft Championship in Sweden. &#34;At races you don&#39;t talk about what you do outside of racing. You just focus on fixing the craft, making it better, making it go faster, getting back out there and trying it out.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p><i>You might also like:<!-- --></i></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="unordered-list-block"><ul><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34658386"><b>Whatever happened to passenger hovercraft?<!-- --></b></a></li><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230714-whats-standing-in-the-way-of-the-flying-car"><b>How close are we to the flying car?<!-- --></b></a></li><li><a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220621-the-giant-hangar-poised-for-an-aviation-revolution"><b>Reinventing the airship for the 2020s<!-- --></b></a></li></ul></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We are worried about the carbon emissions from racing,&#34; adds Deacon. &#34;So it&#39;s great to see that electric hovercraft are now being developed.

It is unlikely there will ever be another huge machine like The Princess Anne. &#34;But climate change is happening and we&#39;re getting more intertidal zones,&#34; says Avery. &#34;So there will be more rescue craft, more survey vessels; and more craft will be needed that have this amphibious ability. We have built one hybrid craft already, and we will see hovercrafts that are fully electric and even hydrogen powered. <!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Â &#34;The niche hovercraft operate in is only going to grow.&#34;<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>-- <!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="text-block"><p><i>If you liked this story,Â <!-- --></i><a target="_self" href="https://cloud.email.bbc.com/SignUp10_08?&amp;at_bbc_team=studios&amp;at_medium=Onsite&amp;at_objective=acquisition&amp;at_ptr_name=bbc.com&amp;at_link_origin=featuresarticle&amp;at_campaign=essentiallist&amp;at_campaign_type=owned&amp;"><i>sign up for The Essential List newsletter<!-- --></i></a><i>Â â€“ a handpicked selection of features, videos and can&#39;t-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.<!-- --></i></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p><i>Join one million Future fans by liking us on <!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture/"><i>Facebook<!-- --></i></a><i>, or follow us on <!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/BBC_Future"><i>Twitter<!-- --></i></a><i> or <!-- --></i><a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcfuture_official/"><i>Instagram<!-- --></i></a><i>.<!-- --></i></p></section><section data-component="text-block"></section><section data-component="tags"></section><section data-testid="ohio-section-outer-3" data-analytics-group="true" data-analytics_group_name="Related" data-analytics_group_type="ohio-3" data-analytics_group_position="1" data-analytics_group_item_count="3"></section><section data-testid="alaska-section-outer" data-analytics-group="true" data-analytics_group_name="More" data-analytics_group_type="alaska-5" data-analytics_group_position="2" data-analytics_group_item_count="5"></section><!--$--><hr data-testid="main-footer-divider"/><!--/$--><!--$--><!--/$--><!--$!--><!--/$--><!--/$--></main></div></div>
