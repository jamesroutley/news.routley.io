    <h1>Jepsen: Capela dda5892</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><a href="https://capela.com">Capela</a> is an unreleased, distributed, general-purpose programming environment. Capela and Jepsen worked together to test several development builds prior to Capela’s initial release. We report four issues in the Capela language, including loops that did not iterate; fourteen crashes or non-fatal panics, including double-borrow errors and corrupting allocator memory; severe performance degradation after roughly a minute of operation; and three safety issues, including partitions ignoring their initial values, sporadically vanishing, and losing committed writes. Most issues occurred in healthy clusters. Capela fixed two of the language issues—all others remain under investigation. This research was funded by Capela Inc., and conducted in accordance with the <a href="https://jepsen.io/analyses/ethics">Jepsen ethics policy</a>.</p><article>
  <div>

<p>Much of modern software involves application logic written in some programming language, which stores state in one or more distributed, fault-tolerant databases. The storage system and application logic usually represent data in different ways, requiring additional languages to query and transform data: <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?StructuredQueryLanguage">SQL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_procedure">stored procedures</a>, etc. There are also usually translation layers between application logic and storage: client libraries, <a href="https://github.com/seancorfield/honeysql?tab=readme-ov-file#usage">query builders</a>, <a href="https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-mongodb-odm/en/2.9/reference/introduction.html">Object-Document Mappers</a>, and so on.</p>
<p><a href="https://capela.com">Capela</a> is an unreleased, distributed, general-purpose programming environment which aims to simplify application development by unifying processing and storage in a single distributed system. Capela hopes that their integrated model will make programs shorter and easier to understand for both human engineers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model">Large Language Models</a>.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Capela programs are written in a dialect of <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, augmented with a sophisticated type system.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Capela allows programmers to write distributed classes whose instances are automatically replicated and persisted to disk. Method invocation is transactional, with <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/strong-serializable">Strong Serializable</a> semantics for pure functions and those which mutate Capela state. Capela also plans to allow functions to perform external I/O, like making calls to HTTP services. Support for external I/O, and its intended consistency model, are still under development.</p>
<p>Readers familiar with distributed languages like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170706113422/https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/sr/language.pdf">SR</a>, <a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/mpd/programs/tutorial.html">MPD</a>, <a href="https://www.erlang.org/doc/system/distributed.html">Erlang</a>, <a href="https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/Publications/documents/Vol1000.pdf">Oz</a>, or <a href="http://bloom-lang.net/">Bloom</a> will recognize elements of Capela. As with Linda’s <a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/COMP590-059-f21/slides/linda-1994.pdf">Tuple Spaces</a>, Capela models distribution not in terms of message passing, but as access to transparently distributed data structures. Like <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?SmalltalkLanguage">Smalltalk</a> and other <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?ImageBasedLanguage">image-based languages</a>, Capela persists program state directly, and allows programs to be modified over time. Indeed, Capela feels somewhat like an object-oriented database with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored_procedure">stored procedures</a>. More recently, blockchain systems like <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/">Ethereum</a> have re-popularized transactional execution over replicated persistent state, viz. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract">smart contracts</a>.</p>
<p>Capela is divided into <em>partitions</em>. Each partition is a logically single-threaded state machine whose state is an instance of a user-provided class. Each partition elects a leader to coordinate writes; that partition’s throughput is limited by the speed of a single node. A cross-partition transaction protocol allows methods and queries to interact with multiple partitions. Like single-partition operations, cross-partition operations (without external I/O) should ensure Strong Serializability.</p>
<p>Methods on Capela objects can be called via an HTTP JSON API, which provides arguments and returns the method’s return value. For example, consider a class which provides a simple map of string keys to integer values:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>class</span> KV(Node):</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    state: Dict[<span>str</span>, <span>int</span>] <span>=</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>      Field(default_factory<span>=</span><span>dict</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span>def</span> <span>set</span>(<span>self</span>, key: <span>str</span>, value: <span>int</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span>:</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span>self</span>.state[key] <span>=</span> value</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span>return</span> value</span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span>def</span> get(<span>self</span>, key: <span>str</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> Optional[<span>int</span>]:</span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span>return</span> <span>self</span>.state.get(key, <span>None</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Users can call <code>set</code> and <code>get</code> by making HTTP POST requests, specifying the ID of an instance of this class. Each instance’s <code>state</code> map is automatically persisted and replicated across nodes. To record in partition <code>!1234...</code> that country singer Kacey Musgraves has won seven CMA awards, one might call:</p>
<pre><code>POST /d/!1234.../set {&#34;key&#34;: &#34;Kacey Musgraves&#34;,
                      &#34;value&#34;: 7}
=&gt; 7</code></pre>
<p>Capela engaged Jepsen early in the development process to verify the safety and fault-tolerance properties of their system. During our engagement, Capela had not yet been released and had no public marketing or documentation. <a href="https://capela.com">Its website</a> launched on 2025-08-06, just prior to the release of this report. Instead, we based our understanding of Capela’s intended guarantees on informal documentation and conversations with Capela’s team. We stress that the issues we discuss in this report are typical of early, unreleased software, and had (as of this writing) no user-facing impact.</p>

<p>We designed a <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela">test suite</a> for Capela using the <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/jepsen">Jepsen testing library</a>. From 2025-04-07 through 2025-05-07, we tested versions <code>dda5892</code> (2025-04-08) through <code>599e9cb</code> (2025-04-28), running on clusters of three to five Debian nodes. We ran our clusters both in <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/">LXC</a> and on multiple <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">EC2</a> VMs. Our <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/tree/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/resources">Python programs</a> were uploaded to the local directory of each node prior to startup.</p>
<p>Our test harness injected <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/src/jepsen/capela/nemesis.clj">a variety of faults</a>, including killing and pausing processes, partial and total network partitions, setting node clocks forward and back by milliseconds to hundreds of seconds, and strobing clocks rapidly between two times. We took snapshots of and later restored chunks of Capela’s data files, and also introduced random single-bit errors into data files. In some tests we ran Capela on top of <a href="https://github.com/dsrhaslab/lazyfs">LazyFS</a>, a FUSE filesystem which can forget un-fsynced data on demand; we coupled that data loss with process crashes to simulate power failures.</p>
<p>Our tests ran several different workloads, which follow.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.1" id="write-read-registers"> Write-Read Registers</h2>
<p>As a simple test of Capela’s transaction semantics, we wrote a <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/resources/wr.py">simple key-value store</a> backed by a single dictionary. In addition to direct writes and reads on individual keys, we implemented a small transaction system which took a list of <code>[function, key, value]</code> micro-operations and applied them sequentially, returning a completed transaction. For example, here is a transaction which intends to read key <code>1</code>, set key <code>1</code> to <code>2</code>, then read key <code>1</code> again:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>[[<span>:r</span> <span>1</span> <span>nil</span>] [<span>:w</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span>] [<span>:r</span> <span>1</span> <span>nil</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Our <code>txn</code> method took that transaction structure, applied it to state in Capela, and returned that same transaction structure, filling in the values read. Assuming the initial value of key <code>1</code> was <code>0</code>:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>[[<span>:r</span> <span>1</span> <span>0</span>] [<span>:w</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span>] [<span>:r</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span>]]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We used the <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/elle">Elle</a> consistency checker to analyze histories of these transactions. For this workload Elle inferred partial version orders for keys by assuming <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/writes-follow-reads">writes follow reads</a> within a single transaction. Given Capela’s goal of Strong Serializability, we also assumed individual keys were <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/linearizable">Linearizable</a> in reconstructing version orders. Elle used those version orders to build a transaction dependency graph, and searched for cycles which would violate Strong Serializability.</p>
<p>Elle also checked for a number of non-cyclic anomalies. For instance, we searched for internal anomalies within a single transaction, like a read which failed to observe the most recent write. We also checked for <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/phenomena/g1a">G1a (Aborted Read)</a>, <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/phenomena/g1b">G1b (Intermediate Read)</a>, and <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/phenomena/p4">P4 (Lost Update)</a>.</p>
<p>We designed two variants of this workload. The simple variant, <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/src/jepsen/capela/workload/wr.clj"><em>wr</em></a>, stored all data in a single partition. A second, <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/src/jepsen/capela/workload/multi_wr.clj"><em>multi-wr</em></a>, created several partitions, each with their own dictionary, and hashed each key to a specific partition. We submitted transactions to a single <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/resources/multi_wr.py">coordinator</a> partition, and indicated which partition each particular key belonged to. This allowed us to test Capela’s cross-partition transaction protocol.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.2" id="list-append"> List Append</h2>
<p>We designed a closely related transactional workload, <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/resources/append.py">list-append</a>. Instead of overwriting values in place, our writes appended a unique integer element to a list identified by some key. From the order of those elements, Elle inferred the order of transactions which produced that version. This allowed us to infer almost all of the <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/dependencies">write-write, write-read, and read-write dependencies</a> which must have been present in a history, detecting additional anomalies.</p>
<p>As with the write-read register workloads, we wrote both <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/src/jepsen/capela/workload/append.clj"><em>append</em></a> and <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/src/jepsen/capela/workload/multi_append.clj"><em>multi-append</em></a> variants, which stored their keys in a single partition, or in multiple partitions, respectively.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.3" id="partition-set"> Partition Set</h2>
<p>Transactions in the write-read register and list-append tests often failed because the partitions they interacted with did not exist. This was particularly surprising as Capela intended to ensure that once created, a call to <code>select(partition-key)</code> would always return that partition, rather than <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/src/jepsen/capela/workload/partition_set.clj"><em>partition-set</em> workload</a> verified this claim by performing two types of operations. First, it could create a single partition in Capela, storing a unique integer value, and remember the key assigned to that partition. Second, the test would try to read all partitions by issuing a <code>select(partition-key)</code> query for each known partition. Once a partition was acknowledged as created, it should appear in every read beginning later.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.4" id="ad-hoc-queries"> Ad Hoc Queries</h2>
<p>As we encountered bugs in the Capela language, we built up <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/src/jepsen/capela/workload/ad_hoc.clj">a collection</a> of handcrafted programs to explore behavior and serve as a regression test. We submitted each of these programs to Capela’s <code>/query</code> endpoint, which evaluates an arbitrary string of code, and compared its return value against an expected result.</p>
<h2 data-number="2.5" id="generative-python"> Generative Python</h2>
<p>We also devised a small, experimental workload called <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/src/jepsen/capela/workload/gen_py.clj">gen-py</a>, which generates simple Python programs and compares how each program runs in <a href="https://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> (a Python interpreter), to how it runs in Capela. We used <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/test_check_beginner">test.check</a>, a property-based testing library, to generate random programs and to shrink faulty programs to smaller examples.</p>
<p>We spent only one day on this workload, so it could generate only simple programs: literals, variable assignments, function definitions, and function calls. Nevertheless, it uncovered several unusual behaviors in Capela.</p>

<p>We begin with four issues in Capela’s Python-compatible language. We then discuss fourteen crashes or non-fatal panics, and a problem with performance degradation after roughly a minute of operation. We finish with three safety errors.</p>
<p>Jepsen filed issues in an <a href="https://github.com/capela-inc/capela-public/issues">empty Github repository</a> Capela set up, with the understanding that it would be made public before the release of this report. However, as of our scheduled publication time, the issue tracker remained private. All issue links will return 404 errors initially, but we hope this will be resolved shortly.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1" id="for-loops-dont-1"> <code>for</code> Loops Don’t (#1)</h2>
<p>In version <code>ebf0f3e</code>, <code>for</code> loops in Capela silently failed to evaluate their bodies. For example, consider the following program which appends elements from one list to another:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>acc <span>=</span> [<span>0</span>]</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>xs <span>=</span> [<span>1</span>,<span>2</span>,<span>3</span>]</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>for</span> x <span>in</span> xs:</span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>    acc.append(x)</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>acc</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When run in Python, this returns <code>[0, 1, 2, 3]</code>. In Capela, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/20250410T161641-destructuring.zip">it returned</a> <code>[0]</code>: the loop was never evaluated. Capela reports that they resolved this issue (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/1">#1</a>) in version 25c4b96.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.2" id="match-is-unimplemented-7"> <code>match</code> is Unimplemented (#7)</h2>
<p>Version <code>ebf0f3e</code> did not support Python’s <code>match</code> expressions, which are analogous to what many languages call <code>switch</code> or <code>case</code>. For example, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/20250415T090714-match.zip">here is a test run</a> which performed a simple match query.</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>x <span>=</span> <span>2</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>match x:</span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>    case <span>1</span>:</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span>&#39;1&#39;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>    case <span>2</span>:</span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span>&#39;2&#39;</span></span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>    case _:</span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span>&#39;other&#39;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>In Python, this would normally return <code>&#39;2&#39;</code>. In Capela, this threw <code>expected an indented block</code>. Since the error message does not mention that <code>match</code> is unimplemented, and does not provide a line number or other pointer to the expression, programmers could have trouble figuring out what had gone wrong. We recommended that Capela provide a more informative error message until <code>match</code> was ready (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/7">#7</a>).</p>
<h2 data-number="3.3" id="destructuring-bind-leaks-internal-structures-2"> Destructuring Bind Leaks Internal Structures (#2)</h2>
<p>In version <code>ebf0f3e</code> and below, destructuring a list leaked internal Capela structures into runtime variables. For example, consider this program, which destructures the list <code>[1, 2]</code>, and should result in <code>y = 2</code>:</p>

<p>In Capela, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/20250415T090714-match.zip">this program returned</a> <code>{:object_type &#34;builtins.Effect&#34;}</code>, rather than <code>2</code>. We found a number of internal representations leaked into return values, including <code>builtins.Effect</code> and <code>builtins.Projection</code>. The cause was simple: while destructuring bind created an effect, it was never applied to the right-hand side of the statement. Capela fixed this issue (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/2">#2</a>) in version <code>599e9cb</code>.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.4" id="semi-lazy-assignment-order-6"> Semi-Lazy Assignment Order (#6)</h2>
<p>Unlike Python, Capela’s variable assignment semantics were somewhat, but not entirely, lazy. This allowed programs which would crash in Python to silently succeed in Capela, and vice-versa. In version <code>ebf0f3e</code>, <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/20250411T120455-lazy-eval.zip">we observed</a> several interesting behaviors. For example, take the program…</p>

<p>This compiles and returns <code>&#39;ok&#39;</code> in Python. Python allows variables to be defined after the functions which use them; <code>f()</code> throws at call time, not compile time. In Capela, this program threw <code>name not found: x</code>; the compiler required that variables referred to in a function be defined beforehand. On the other hand, Capela allowed the use of unbound variables <em>outside</em> a function:</p>

<p>In Python, this throws <code>name &#39;y&#39; is not defined</code>. In Capela, it returned the JSON object <code>{:object_type &#34;builtins.Thunk&#34;}</code>—a representation of an internal structure representing lazy evaluation. This laziness allowed programs to read values “from the lexical future”:</p>

<p>This returned <code>2</code>, rather than Python’s <code>name &#39;x&#39; is not defined</code>. On the other hand, sometimes assignment in Capela did occur in lexical order:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>y <span>=</span> x</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>x <span>=</span> <span>1</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>z <span>=</span> x</span>
<span id="cb11-4"><a href="#cb11-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>x <span>=</span> <span>2</span></span>
<span id="cb11-5"><a href="#cb11-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>[x, y, z]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This returned <code>[2, 2, 1]</code>: <code>x</code> observed <code>y</code>’s later value, even though it was assigned before <code>y</code> existed. However, <code>z</code> observed <code>y</code>’s earlier value, even though it was assigned after <code>x</code>!</p>
<p>One might assume that Python programmers would simply not write programs like this. However, programmers do make mistakes and use variables out of order by accident. In Python, the language’s (mostly) eager assignment order catches these kinds of errors early. In Capela, several of our test programs inadvertently fell afoul of lazy evaluation, silently returning incorrect results. Debugging these issues took considerable effort.</p>
<p>Capela states their compiler “should codegen IR that preserves the expected Python behavior.” We opened <a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/6">#6</a> for these divergences from Python.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.5" id="unset-env-panics-16"> Unset <code>Env</code> Panics (#16)</h2>
<p>When attempting to create a new partition with initial values, or when executing transactions, version <code>1cde55b</code> would often return <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/20250410T124051-create-partition-env-error.zip">an HTTP 500 error</a> complaining a task had panicked:</p>
<pre><code>POST /partitions {&#34;object_type&#34;: &#34;foo.Foo&#34;,
                  &#34;id&#34;: 0}
=&gt; HTTP 500 &#39;task 824 panicked with message
   &#34;Env is not set for the current thread&#34;&#39;</code></pre>
<p>These panics appeared constantly in node logs, even in healthy clusters. In some cases the node continued running; in others, it crashed. The most common source was <code>ext_serde.rs:57</code>. Capela is investigating this issue (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/16">#16</a>).</p>
<h2 data-number="3.6" id="replication-lag-crash-4"> Replication Lag Crash (#4)</h2>
<p>In our initial tests of version <code>ebf0f3e</code>, we found that Capela reliably crashed after roughly a minute of operation. After a few hundred transactions a node would often panic, complaining that it <code>Failed to receive block from BlockExchange: Lagged</code>. For instance, take <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/20250411T120455-block-lag-crash.zip">this short test</a>, on which node <code>n1</code> crashed after about ten seconds:</p>
<pre><code>thread &#39;netdev&#39; panicked at
uvm_syn/src/net/libp2p/driver/blocks.rs:199:25:

<h2 data-number="3.17" id="crashes-on-startup-with-.sst-file-bitflips-10"> Crashes on Startup With <code>.sst</code> File Bitflips (#10)</h2>
<p>Capela uses sorted strings tables (<code>.sst</code> files) to store data on disk. In version <code>ebf0f3e</code>, introducing a handful of single-bit errors into one of these <code>.sst</code> files caused the node to crash immediately on startup, logging <code>Corruption: block checksum mismatch</code>. For example, take <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/20250418T083513-bitflip-storage-crash.zip">this run</a>, where corruption in <code>n1</code>’s <code>storage/00031.sst</code> caused <code>n1</code> to crash with:</p>

<h2 data-number="3.19" id="performance-degradation-19"> Performance Degradation (#19)</h2>
<p>After roughly 20 to 100 seconds of operation, healthy clusters typically flipped into a degraded state. Goodput dropped from roughly 50 to about 0.2 transactions per second. Latencies on most nodes jumped from roughly five milliseconds to over five seconds (our client socket timeout). Here are typical plots of latency and throughput over time, for a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/20250430T115614-perf-degradation.zip">five-node cluster running version <code>599e9cb</code></a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/degraded-rate.png" alt="A timeseries plot of request rates over time, broken down by whether transactions succeeded, were indefinite, or failed. The rate peaks at 60 OK transactions per second, then falls to near-zero at 25 seconds."/><br/>
</p>
<p><img src="https://jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/degraded-latency.png" alt="Timeseries plot of latencies for the same test run. Latencies are generally between 0 to 8 ms for OK operations, and 10-40 for aborted transactions. At 25 seconds, everything starts timing out after 5,000 ms."/><br/>
</p>
<p>In this test, the performance degradation was contemporaneous with node <code>n4</code> crashing due to a <code>BlockExchange: Lagged</code> panic. The test suite detected the crash and restarted <code>n4</code>, but the cluster never recovered. From that point on, only requests against node <code>n1</code> succeeded. All others timed out.</p>

<h2 data-number="3.20" id="new-partitions-ignore-provided-fields-3"> New Partitions Ignore Provided Fields (#3)</h2>
<p>When creating a partition, one provides a JSON map with the <code>object_type</code> to be instantiated, and any fields one wishes to set on the resulting object. For example, consider a dog with a <code>name</code> field:</p>
<div id="cb25"><pre><code><span id="cb25-1"><a href="#cb25-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span>class</span> Dog(Node):</span>
<span id="cb25-2"><a href="#cb25-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    name: <span>str</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>To create a particularly noble dog, one might make an HTTP request like…</p>
<pre><code>POST /partitions
{&#34;object_type&#34;: &#34;dog.Dog&#34;,
 &#34;name&#34;: &#34;Baron Frederick von Puppington III&#34;}</code></pre>
<p>In version <code>1cde55b</code> and below, this created a <code>Dog</code> with no name: the <code>get_or_create_partition</code> function ignored any fields provided and hardcoded an initial payload of <code>None</code>. Moreover, since partitions are uniquely identified by their state, making multiple POST requests to create different dogs would, in fact, return the same empty dog each time. This issue (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/3">#3</a>) was fixed in version <code>ebf0f3e</code> (2024-04-10), but returned in <code>599e9cb</code> (2024-04-28). Capela is investigating.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.21" id="partitions-vanish-and-reappear-24"> Partitions Vanish And Reappear (#24)</h2>
<p>After their creation has been acknowledged, partitions in Capela should always appear to readers. However, in version <code>ebf0f3e</code>, we found that partitions sporadically disappeared after being created. This occurred even in healthy clusters under minimal load. We observed this problem frequently in our list-append tests—where it caused transactions to abort—and designed the partition-set workload to confirm.</p>
<p>For example, take <a href="https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20066990/20250506T110419.058-0500.zip">this test run</a>, which attempted to create eight partitions, each storing a single unique integer. Seven of those attempts (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) succeeded. However, only partition 5 was reliably visible to all readers at the end of the test. For the other six partitions, calls to <code>select(partition-key)</code> returned <code>None</code> on some nodes.</p>
<p>Capela is investigating this issue (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/24">#24</a>).</p>
<h2 data-number="3.22" id="lost-update-5"> Lost Update (#5)</h2>
<p>In version <code>ebf0f3e</code>, transactions involving reads and writes to our <a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/capela/blob/90ebe472f6a9d4e5590e0a10be492e6243438c9d/resources/wr.py">single-partition key-value store</a> appeared to exhibit <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/phenomena/p4">P4 (Lost Update)</a>. For instance, here is a <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/20250411T120455-lost-update.zip">20-second test run</a> which performed 1,633 successful transactions against a healthy three-node cluster, without faults. It found 50 instances of Lost Update: two or more committed transactions which read the same version of some key, then wrote that key.</p>

<p>Here are five of those transactions, all of which read key <code>10</code>&#39;s value as <code>176</code>, wrote some other value for key <code>10</code>, and committed. None of them observed the others’ effects, which is why there are read-write (<code>:rw</code>) dependencies between them. Under <a href="https://software.imdea.org/~andrea.cerone/works/Framework.pdf">Update Atomic</a>, at most one of these transactions may commit. This history therefore violates Update Atomic, Parallel Snapshot Isolation, Snapshot Isolation, Serializability, and so on.</p>
<p>Transactions also observed divergent timelines of writes to individual keys. For example, here are the first few non-empty reads of key <code>12</code> from <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/jepsen.io/analyses/capela-dda5892/20250430T083431-incompatible-order.zip">a short list-append test</a>:</p>

<p>After this time, the elements <code>[1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]</code> were stable, though later elements continued to fluctuate. Since transactions only ever append elements, every read of key <code>12</code> should have been consistent—namely, a prefix of the longest version of the list. Instead, transactions observed elements which appeared for some time, then vanished permanently. These lost elements could also be seen by multiple transactions. The first read of <code>[1, 2]</code> above was performed by the transaction which appended <code>2</code>:</p>
<div id="cb27"><pre><code><span id="cb27-1"><a href="#cb27-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>[[<span>:append</span> <span>12</span> <span>2</span>]</span>
<span id="cb27-2"><a href="#cb27-2" aria-hidden="true"></a> [<span>:r</span> <span>12</span> [<span>1</span> <span>2</span>]]</span>
<span id="cb27-3"><a href="#cb27-3" aria-hidden="true"></a> [<span>:append</span> <span>12</span> <span>3</span>]]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, this append of <code>2</code> was also observed by a concurrent, read-only transaction, before it vanished permanently.</p>
<div id="cb28"><pre><code><span id="cb28-1"><a href="#cb28-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>[[<span>:r</span> <span>6</span> [<span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> ...]]</span>
<span id="cb28-2"><a href="#cb28-2" aria-hidden="true"></a> [<span>:r</span> <span>6</span> [<span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> ...]]</span>
<span id="cb28-3"><a href="#cb28-3" aria-hidden="true"></a> [<span>:r</span> <span>7</span> [<span>4</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> ...]]</span>

<p>Prior to version <code>599e9cb</code>, transactions never aborted. In <code>599e9cb</code>, transactions often returned HTTP 500 errors with the message <code>Transaction aborted</code>, and we no longer observed Lost Update or incompatible orders in list-append tests. However, we continued to see them with write-read registers. There may have been two separate bugs, or perhaps the change to transaction error handling only affected the list-append workload.</p>
<p>Capela is unsure what caused this bug (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/5">#5</a>), or why their changes might have affected it. Investigation is ongoing.</p>

<p>Capela engaged Jepsen early in the development process to help validate safety and fault tolerance. During our collaboration in spring 2025, Capela was still an unreleased prototype with no documentation. Core features such as iteration and side effects had not yet been implemented. Builds routinely crashed after a few seconds, and throughput generally fell to just a few transactions per second after a minute or so. We observed frequent data loss. We stress that these are normal behaviors for a system in early development—Capela intends to resolve safety issues and crashes prior to their first public release. Capela also aims to support most, if not all, of Python’s semantics before the release.</p>
<p>While language semantics were not the focus of our investigation, we found four issues in Capela’s Python compiler: unsupported syntax (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/7">#7</a>), semi-lazy variable assignment (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/6">#6</a>), <code>for</code> loops which quietly did nothing (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/1">#1</a>), and internal language structures leaking out of destructuring bind (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/2">#2</a>). Issues #1 and #2 were resolved in <code>25c4b96</code> and <code>599e9cb</code> respectively; the others have yet to be addressed.</p>
<p>We found fourteen crashes or non-fatal panics in Capela. Nodes panicked due to missing <code>Env</code> structures (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/16">#16</a>), slow replication (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/4">#4</a>, <a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/22">#22</a>), double-borrow errors (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/8">#8</a>, <a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/17">#17</a>, <a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/18">#18</a>), unimplemented code (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/11">#11</a>), double-free or other memory corruption errors (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/12">#12</a>, <a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/21">#21</a>), B-tree height invariant errors (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/15">#15</a>), an index out of bounds (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/23">#23</a>), unreachable code (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/13">#13</a>), and file corruption (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/10">#10</a>, <a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/14">#14</a>). Many took down the node entirely. All but the last three occurred in healthy clusters. We also found severe performance degradation in almost every test run. After roughly a minute, transaction throughput would drop by two orders of magnitude, and RPC requests to most nodes would simply time out (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/19">#19</a>). Capela is investigating these issues.</p>
<p>Finally, we found three safety issues in Capela. Newly created partitions silently ignored the initial values provided for their fields (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/3">#3</a>). Partitions would randomly vanish and reappear after creation (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/24">#24</a>). Transactions also frequently lost writes. We observed both <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/phenomena/p4">P4</a> and incompatible versions of keys in list-append tests, which suggests versions temporarily diverged before being lost (<a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/5">#5</a>). All three issues remain extant.</p>
<p>Since Capela had no external users during our collaboration, these bugs had no real impact on users. Capela will continue to invest in testing and resolving bugs prior to their initial release.</p>
<p>As always, Jepsen takes an experimental approach to safety verification: we can prove the presence of bugs, but not their absence. While we make extensive efforts to find problems, we cannot prove correctness. In particular, our tests were limited by Capela’s frequent crashes and performance degradation. Capela could have additional correctness bugs which did not appear in our tests because we could not perform enough transactions to encounter them.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="future-work"> Future Work</h2>
<p>We found a number of additional crashes or panics which, for want of time, we omit from this report. Several places in the Capela code attempt to call <code>Result::unwrap()</code> on an <code>Err</code> value—for example, issue <a href="https://github.com/asmc-ai/capela-public/issues/9">#9</a>. It also seems likely that the Capela language has more features which are unimplemented or incorrect, such as <code>with</code> expressions. Capela plans to expand their language test coverage prior to release. Additional generative testing of programs may prove fruitful.</p>
<p>We have several plans for additional Capela tests. We would like to create partitions dynamically during the <code>list-append</code> workload, rather than up-front. We would like to store data in multiple instance variables per object. Finally, we believe it would be useful to test other data structures—both those provided by Capela and ones we implement ourselves. Instead of using the built-in list type, we could summon (so to speak) a list from the void.</p>
