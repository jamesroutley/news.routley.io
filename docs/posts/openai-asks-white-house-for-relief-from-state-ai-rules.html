OpenAI said the administration should consider providing some relief for AI companies big and small from state rules – if and when enacted – in exchange for voluntary access to models.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->The recommendation was one of several included in OpenAI’s response to a request for public input issued by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in February as the administration drafts a new policy to ensure US dominance in AI. President Donald Trump previously rescinded the Biden administration’s sprawling executive order on AI and tasked the science office with developing an AI Action Plan by July.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->To date, there has been a notable absence of federal legislation governing the AI sector. The Trump administration has generally signaled its intention to take a hands-off approach to regulating the technology. But many states are actively weighing new measures on everything from deepfakes to bias in AI systems.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>    <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Chris Lehane, OpenAI’s vice president of global affairs, said in an interview that the US AI Safety Institute – a key government group focused on AI – could act as the main point of contact between the federal government and the private sector. If companies work with the group voluntarily to review models, the government could provide them “with liability protections including preemption from state based regulations that focus on frontier model security,” according to the proposal.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->“Part of the incentive for doing that ought to be that you don’t have to go through the state stuff, which is not going to be anywhere near as good as what the federal level would be,” Lehane said.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p>  <p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->In its policy recommendations, OpenAI also reiterated its call for the government to take steps to support AI infrastructure investments and called for copyright reform, arguing that America’s fair use doctrine is critical to maintaining AI leadership. OpenAI and other AI developers have faced numerous copyright lawsuits over the data used to build their models.<!-- HTML_TAG_END --></p> </div>       </div></div> </div>     <section><header> </header>   </section></div></article> </section></section></section>    </div></div>
