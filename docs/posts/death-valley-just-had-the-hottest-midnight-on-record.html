    <h1>Death Valley Just Had the Hottest Midnight on Record</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/NewsArticle"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p><img data-reference="image" data-document-id="cms/api/amp/image/AA1e2wsS"/></p><ul><li> The hottest midnight on record was just recorded. </li><li> From 12 a.m. to 1 a.m. on July 17, Death Valley hit a record 120°F.</li><li> This measurement is still preliminary, but it follows a string of heat-related records broken just this summer.</li></ul><p>It’s getting hot out there. Hot enough that even the Sun setting isn’t quite enough to get that pesky heat index down very far. In fact, just a few days ago, <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoors/a9308/how-to-survive-7-days-in-death-valley-15782830/">Death Valley</a> may have set an all-time heat record for hottest midnight ever. Between 12am and 1 am on July 17, the Badwater basin weather station clocked a temperature of 120°F.</p><p>120°F. At <em>midnight.</em> </p><p>It’s yet another wild effect of the heatwave currently broiling much of the south and southwestern U.S. According to <em><a href="https://www.iflscience.com/hottest-midnight-ever-may-have-been-recorded-in-death-valley-69873">IFLScience</a></em>, this month has seen the repeated breaking of the record for the hottest day, and has included the setting of a new record for the <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a21869/heat-wave-next-week/">hottest week</a>. </p><p>The incredibly <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a30270365/hottest-place-on-earth/">hot temperature</a> has not, however, broken the record for hottest night—amazingly enough. That remains held by Khasab Airport in Oman remained above 111.6°F for the entire night. </p><p>Nonetheless, it’s still an impressive—if not worrying—statistic. But before we get ahead of ourselves, it hasn’t quite been confirmed yet. These claims of record-breaking heat are based on preliminary readings that will soon be subject to further analysis. </p><p>However, experts are pretty sure the record will stand. Meteorologist Jeff Masters told <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1553576&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newscientist.com%2Farticle%2F2382959-death-valley-may-have-just-had-the-hottest-recorded-midnight-ever%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fenvironment%2Fa44580915%2Fdeath-valley-hottest-midnight-ever%2F">New Scientist</a></em> that he expects the record will remain on further inspection. That being said, it’s also important to remember that statistics on maximum nighttime <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a37852132/coldest-temperature-recorded-in-lab/">temperature</a> simply aren’t kept, and hourly temperature data has only been kept for about a decade or so. The record may still stand, but it also may not have much to be compared to.</p><p>But whether or not the record stands, one thing is unequivocal—it. is. <em>hot.</em> And it seems to be getting hotter and hotter, all while relief is becoming harder and harder to find in some regions. This lack of relief in particular can be <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a22584056/rising-temperatures-could-lead-increased-suicide-rates/">dangerous</a> for people, as never being able to escape intense heat can have serious effects on health, such as dehydration, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. </p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, experts are linking this <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a23834/record-hot-years-could-be-new-normal-by-2025/">growing global heat</a> to the climate crisis currently affecting our Earth. “Climate change and temperature increase has spurred a surge in reports of record weather and climate extremes, especially for heat,” Randall Cerveny, a professor of geographical sciences at Arizona State University, said in a statement to <em><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1553576&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newscientist.com%2Farticle%2F2382959-death-valley-may-have-just-had-the-hottest-recorded-midnight-ever%2F&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fenvironment%2Fa44580915%2Fdeath-valley-hottest-midnight-ever%2F">New Scientist</a></em>. “We have to make sure that these records are verified for the sake of scientific understanding and accuracy.”</p><p>So, out the researchers go to verify temperature readings and make new ones. Considering the pattern we’re currently seeing, if any of those readings constitutes a new world record, it wouldn’t be too surprising to see that record broken again before long. </p><p><img data-reference="slideshow" data-document-id="cms/api/amp/slideshow/AA149qTW"/><img alt="The measurements are still preliminary, but the heat is not letting up this year." title="Death Valley Just Had The Hottest Midnight Ever" src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1e2wsS.img"/></p></div></article></div>
