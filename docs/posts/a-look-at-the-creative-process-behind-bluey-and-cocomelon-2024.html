Conversely, </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> — which started on YouTube — is algorithmic slop that has been called “crack for kids” and is probably as educational as taping strobe lights to your child’s eyeballs. </span></p><p>Let me explain.</p><p>***</p><p><em>Bluey </em><span>debuted in 2018 and has cranked out 152 episodes — about 7 minutes each — across three seasons. The 153rd episode is scheduled for April 14 and many believe that it will be the end of the show in its current form (more on this later).</span></p><p><span>The show was created by Joe Brumm, an Australian who started his professional career in the UK&#39;s TV animation industry. Before returning to Australia in 2009, Brumm worked on successful children’s shows including </span><em>Charlie &amp; Lola </em><span>and</span><em> Peppa Pig</em><span> (</span><em>Peppa’s</em><span> production company Entertainment One sold the brand to Hasbro for a whopping $4B in 2019).</span></p><p><span>In 2015, Brumm teamed up with Brisbane-based Ludo Studios to shop a 1-minute teaser of </span><em>Bluey</em><span>. This short version of the show failed to find a buyer because the target audience wasn’t clear. Was it meant for adults or children? The confusion stemmed from the fact that Brumm had originally planned to create an R-rated version of </span><em>Peppa Pig</em><span>.</span></p><p>Ultimately, Brumm decided to make a show for preschoolers. He pulled material from his own life as a father of two girls under the age of 10. </p><p><span>With the kid focus, Ludo convinced the country’s national broadcaster (Australian Broadcasting Corporation aka ABC) to give Brumm $13k for a single 5-minute episode. ABC saw the potential and greenlit $5m+ for a first season. Unable to foot the whole bill, ABC partnered with BBC Studios, the business arm of the UK’s national broadcaster. BBC negotiated the global distribution, licensing and merchandising rights for </span><em>Bluey</em><span> (in other words, ABC is barely profiting from one of  the country’s largest cultural exports since Mad Max, AC/DC, Kylie Minogue,  Crocodile Dundee or Men at Work). </span></p><p><span>How did </span><em>Bluey</em><span> become such a hit? </span></p><p><span>It has great animation with funny and emotional writing that parents want to watch with their kids. I mentioned hungover parenting as one theme but </span><em>Bluey</em><span> has ably dealt with many grown-up topics including infertility, mental health and death.</span></p><p><span>In an interview with </span><em>The Hollywood Reporter, </em><span>Brumm </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/bluey-creator-disney-notes-peppa-ping-inspiration-1235508845/" rel="">said</a><span> he chose this approach because he noticed a gap in the market. He wanted “a good co-viewing show where the parents could genuinely watch it with the kids” and there weren’t many options for the “the preschool stage”. </span></p><p>The co-viewing magic happens because the show’s parents (Bandi, Chilli) are just as integral to the storyline as the kids (Bluey, Bingo). Preschoolers love inventing games and making their parents play with them. It is their way of learning how the world works.</p><p><em>Bluey </em><span>is a mix of games that every parent knows (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDrqgBb1dC4" rel="">“driving a bus”</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHIKWpZrULE" rel="">“keepy uppy with a balloon”</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZqOJC8VobE" rel="">“cardboard box forts”</a><span>) as well as games that Brumm has pulled from his own life (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DklpM_lZIOU" rel="">“Magic Xylophone”</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqExJdPYu00" rel="">“The Magic Claw”</a><span>). </span></p><p><span>How does Brumm come up with these ideas? In the most parenting way possible as he explained on the </span><em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/mk/podcast/how-joe-brumm-dads/id1650126940?i=1000625580746" rel="">How Other Dads Dad</a></em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/mk/podcast/how-joe-brumm-dads/id1650126940?i=1000625580746" rel=""> podcast</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>[The games on Bluey are] just games that evolved at 5 in the morning [while taking care of the kids]. And “evolve” is a good word because some games you play once and they&#39;re a bit boring and they just fall away. </em></p><p><em>Others you find, “Hey, can we play that game again?” </em></p><p><em>And you&#39;re like, “Yeah, all right and let&#39;s add this.”  </em></p><p><em>Two months later  [that game has] got a name.</em></p></blockquote><p>The uniqueness of each game comes through particularly well because Brumm has written nearly every episode on his own. The solo process was a deliberate choice because — coming from a TV background — Brumm knew that a team of TV writers would likely lead to a formulaic product.</p><p>There is no magic to the writing, either.</p><p><span>In a relatable passage for any writer, Brumm tells the </span><em><a href="https://www.blueypod.com/e/joe-brumm-aka-the-interview/" rel="">Gotta Be Done</a></em><a href="https://www.blueypod.com/e/joe-brumm-aka-the-interview/" rel=""> podcast</a><span> how he gets an idea on paper and then edits and edits: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>I think the first thing I&#39;ve realized is…just write [the first draft quickly] and don&#39;t show anyone because it is terrible. […] Know that it is going to suck and it is going to be all over the place. </em></p><p><em>But then it&#39;s there. Then I print it out. Then I go lie on a couch and it looks like I&#39;m loafing, but then it&#39;s just scribbling. Let&#39;s move this here…cut it up and rearrange it on the table. </em></p><p><em>You&#39;ve just got to write that first draft.</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Bluey’s </em><span>distinctiveness</span><em> </em><span>also comes from the voice actors, who are actual children from Brisbane. When the show was being shopped internationally, many buyers — including Disney — wanted to re-record the voices. However, Brumm fought to keep the Aussie accents and this decision definitely helps the show stand out.</span></p><p><span>I&#39;ll add one more Aussie-related fun fact. The &#34;Heeler&#34; family is named after the Blue Heeler dogs, herding dogs specially bred in Australia in the mid-1800s to shepherd cattle over long distances (also known as &#34;cattle dogs&#34;). In a nice symmetry to how </span><em>Bluey </em><span>is making waves internationally, these dogs were once a major export for the country. The show’s popularity has led to some people buying Blue Heelers as a pet for their kids…which will probably backfire because they aren’t meant to be house dogs (Blue Heelers need an insane amount of exercise and can be pretty aggressive). </span></p><p><span>“[Making </span><em>Bluey </em><span>is</span><em>]</em><span> a craft thing,” Brumm said in the </span><em>The Hollywood Reporter </em><span>interview</span><em>. “</em><span>We really tried to get it to look beautiful and to sound beautiful. It should have its own score and its own visual style and really not just [be about] trying to knock it out for cheap.”</span></p><p>Add it all up and Brumm is telling a story that is uniquely his own.</p><p>***</p><p><span>Some quick background on </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span>.</span></p><p>It started in 2006 as a children’s education YouTube channel called That’sMeOnTv.com. </p><p>Korean-American Jay Jeon and his wife created the channel with animated alphabet songs to teach children how to read. The channel rebranded twice before becoming Cocomelon in 2018. By this time, Jeon and a team of animators in California were creating 3D-animated videos of kids doing kids things while singing public domain nursery rhymes.</p><p><span>As more parents turned to YouTube to entertain their children, Cocomelon rocketed up the charts.

He is basing his work on real-life social play and his &#34;5am&#34; interactions with his children. For each idea, he navigates a writing maze and incorporates adult themes to develop the ideal 7-minute co-viewing experience. </p><p>It is craftsmanship. </p><p><span>Contrast everything I just wrote with </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/arts/television/cocomelon-moonbug-entertainment.html" rel="">Moonbug’s “audience research day”</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Once a month, children are brought to [a London studio], one at a time, and shown a handful of episodes to figure out exactly which parts of the shows are engaging and which are tuned out.</em></p><p><em>For anyone older than 2 years old, the team deploys a whimsically named tool: the Distractatron.</em></p><p><em>It’s a small TV screen, placed a few feet from the larger one, that plays a continuous loop of banal, real-world scenes — a guy pouring a cup of coffee, someone getting a haircut — each lasting about 20 seconds. Whenever a youngster looks away from the Moonbug show to glimpse the Distractatron, a note is jotted down.</em></p><p><em>“It’s not mega-interesting, what’s on the Distractatron,” said Maurice Wheeler, who runs the research group. “But if they aren’t fully focused, they might go, ‘Oh, what’s that?’ and kind of drift over. We can see what they’re looking at and the exact moment when they got distracted.”</em></p></blockquote><p>I repeat: a “Distractatron”. </p><p><span>Brumm recently launched the </span><em><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/behind-bluey" rel="">Behind Bluey</a></em><span> podcast. In it, Brumm talks to various team members (animators, voice actors etc.) about creating the show. I haven’t listened to all of the episodes yet but I’m guessing…THEY DON’T USE A F—ING DISTRACTATRON!!!</span></p><p><span>Here is more from the </span><em>NYT</em><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em>Outside this office, some 270 employees are working on Moonbug shows in the company’s headquarters, a sleek, open-plan space on one floor of a four-story building beside a canal in Camden Town, a district in northwest London. Pre- and post- production are handled here and in the United States, where the company has another 120 staffers, mostly in Los Angeles. The company works with animators around the world.</em></p><p><em>Those hands are nothing if not data driven. [Moonbug Entertainment CEO] René Rechtman has a background in private equity and is more of an algorithm guy than an artist. Shows at Moonbug are honed in ways that leave little to chance, and audience research commences long before any episode gets near the Distractatron.</em></p><p><em>A data and analytics team sifts constantly through YouTube numbers to determine exactly what resonates. Should a girl wear black jeans or blue jeans? Should the music be louder or softer? Should the bus be yellow or red?</em></p><p><em>Yellow, is the answer.</em></p><p><em>“Kids love yellow buses around the world,” said David Levine, the chief content officer at Moonbug. “In some countries, yellow buses are actually used to transport prisoners. But still, kids around the world love to see yellow buses and kids on yellow buses.”</em></p><p><em>Infants are also enamored with objects covered in a little dirt, like they’ve been rolling around on the ground. And they’re fascinated by minor injuries. Not broken legs or gruesome wounds. More like small cuts that require Band-Aids.</em></p><p><em>“The trifecta for a kid would be a dirty yellow bus that has a boo-boo,” Levine said. “Broken fender, broken wheel, little grimace on its face.”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Moonbug has </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> down to a science. It is an assembly line — a very lucrative assembly line — that is feeding YouTube’s algorithm and Netflix’s kid show tab. </span></p><p><em>Bluey</em><span> has a creative process. </span></p><p><em>Cocomelon</em><span> is processed. </span></p><p>***</p><p><span>Listen, I know I’m going pretty hard on </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span>.</span></p><p>Parenting is difficult. </p><p>I get it. </p><p><em>Cocomelon</em><span> is a digital babysitter for time-strapped caregivers. I won’t pretend like I haven’t stuck an iPad in front of my son and let him watch </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> or </span><em>Blippi</em><span> so I could get some work done. Guilty as charged. </span></p><p><span>The show has more educational content compared to other popular YouTube kids genres including toy unboxings, Hot Wheels on ramps or </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/culture/2017/11/21/16685874/kids-youtube-video-elsagate-creepiness-psychology" rel="">that time the algo was recomnending creepy videos with headless comic-book characters</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>It is more than just “taping strobe lights to your child’s eyeballs”. But</span><strong> </strong><span>there are just better options than </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> for YouTube and streaming imo (including </span><em>Bluey</em><span>, of course).</span></p><p><span>The Moonbug team did raise a larger point in the </span><em>NYT</em><span> article: </span><em>Cocomelon </em><span>is not meant to be a substitute for normal play. “It just</span><em> </em><span>should not replace the time you’re outside bicycling,” says Rechtman. “Or outside playing with your friends. That’s for sure.”</span></p><p><span>Same goes for </span><em>Bluey</em><span>. While it is a superior shared experience, watching the show with my son will never be better than biking with him at the park or playing his invented games (including ones from </span><em>Bluey</em><span> that he loves and adapts). </span></p><p><span>Let’s put the parenting aspect of these shows aside and talk about </span><em>Bluey </em><span>vs. </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> as a view on art and media. </span></p><p><em>Cocomelon</em><span> is as formulaic as it gets. There are countless </span><em>Cocomelon </em><span>knock-offs on YouTube right now because it’s so easy to knock off. Take a nursery rhyme from the public domain. Slap on some colorful animation. Pack the YouTube video with the correct keywords. Maybe even pay for some algorithmic-boosting secret sauce. </span></p><p><span>Next thing you know, the top YouTube search result for “Wheels on the Bus” is a Cocomelon knock-off called </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnRK9giGyBE" rel="">Lalafun Nursery Rhymes</a><span>. </span></p><p>Every new iteration of AI will make it easier and easier to create a &#34;Cocomelon&#34; clone. </p><p>However, do you know what AI isn&#39;t capable of producing today or in the foreseeable future? A thoughtful 7-minute episode about hungover parenting that is equally enjoyable for parents and kids.</p><p><span>In the face of the upcoming AI-powered content deluge, I keep going back to this quote that music super-producer Rick Rubin mentioned on the Joe Rogan </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5oDyN0CFjEwClqjZxJQf9O" rel="">podcast</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p><em><span>“Everything I do is just personal taste and it’s what the book is about. Really, for [people and artists] to trust in themselves. Make something that speaks to themselves. And hopefully someone else will like it. But you can’t second-guess your own taste for what someone else is going to like. It won’t be good. We’re not smart enough to know what someone else will like.</span></em></p></blockquote><p><span>That basically describes </span><em>Cocomelon</em><span> vs. </span><em>Bluey</em><span>.</span></p><p>The former works off of a formula for what the audience might like. The latter is an expression of a single person’s unique taste.</p><p><span>Brumm echoed a similar thought as Rubin when asked on the </span><em>Gotta Be Done</em><span> podcast if he chose characters and plot lines with a marketing lens: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>Look, I suppose the one thing I did not want to do was approach [Bluey] from a marketing point of view. […] My approach was, well, I&#39;m just going to make something that&#39;s good and…that will be the marketing decision. Let&#39;s just make something that&#39;s good.</em><span> </span></p></blockquote><p><span>This is the approach that gave us “Sleepytime”, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DEBViLEoXc" rel="">which is about sleep training toddlers and is probably the episode of </a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DEBViLEoXc" rel="">Bluey</a></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DEBViLEoXc" rel=""> that parents love the most</a><span>. It transcends “children’s content” and embodies a Robin Williams quote from the film </span><em>Dead Poets Society </em><span>which Brumm cites as inspiration: </span></p><blockquote><p><em>“Medicine, law, business, engineering, these are all noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.”</em></p></blockquote><div id="youtube2-5DEBViLEoXc" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;5DEBViLEoXc&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5DEBViLEoXc?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>I write all of this knowing that there is a finite amount of </span><em>Bluey</em><span>-caliber content.</span></p><p><em>Cocomelon </em><span>is McDonald’s and </span><em>Bluey </em><span>is a Michelin restaurant. There is a place in the market for both but McDonald’s has a much more repeatable model.</span></p><p><span>The challenge of keeping up the Michelin quality is a concern for </span><em>Bluey </em><span>with many fans worried that Brumm is leaving the show. The season 3 finale — which will air on April 14 — is unusually long (clocking in at 28 minutes) and is titled &#34;The Sign&#34; (leading theorists to believe it may refer to a moving sign for the Heeler family).</span></p><p>Why would Brumm leave? His daughters have gotten older (which means less material). Meanwhile, the voice actors — including some Brisbane-based children — are also getting older (which means their voices are changing).</p><p>The brand is so valuable and BBC/Ludo will find a way to milk it. There is already a live play and talk of a film.</p><p>But without Brumm, the TV show will lose its unique soul…like that part in the “Whale Watching” episode when Chilli asks Bandit to get some chips and sour cream dip to help her recover from the hangover. I’ve done that at least 100x for my wife and snickered when Chilli made the request. My son was none the wiser and that’s what made the co-viewing experience so great.</p><p><em><span>Today’s SatPost is brought to you by </span><a href="https://bearly.ai/" rel="">Bearly.AI</a></em><strong>Why are you seeing this ad?</strong></p><p>Because I co-founded an AI-powered research app and my technical partner is doing all the real work while I make dumb jokes and offer coupons. </p><p>We just added Claude Opus, a powerful new AI language model for querying, summarizing and editing large text documents (or help with your code, which I can&#39;t do but you might find helpful).  </p><p><span>Use code </span><strong>BEARLY1</strong><span> for a </span><a href="https://link.workweek.com/click/34624661.2043/aHR0cHM6Ly9iZWFybHkuYWkvP2hhc2hlZF91c2VyPTlkNjI1ODJkZjgzMDUwNGZjOGU2NWQyZWY0ZGNhMGE4/62b3df6ab05e1477650912a3B51bad66f" rel="">free month of the Bearly AI Pro Plan</a><span> and try Claude Opus. </span></p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://bearly.ai/&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Try Bearly AI for FREE&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://bearly.ai/" rel=""><span>Try Bearly AI for FREE</span></a></p><p><strong>Instagram’s revenue revealed: </strong><span>Zuck Daddy Flex acquired Instagram for $1B in 2012.

Other people definitely saw it, with the eclipse-related economic impact in the US estimated at $6B (that is Taylor Swift levels).</span></p><p><span>Within that spending, </span><em>The Economist</em><span> detailed the </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2024/04/06/airbnb-bookings-for-the-solar-eclipse-reach-astronomical-levels" rel="">business of short-term home rentals</a><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>The eclipse path in the US was 180km wide</p></li><li><p>There were 92,000 Airbnb and VRBO rentals in the path</p></li><li><p>92% occupancy on the Sunday night (vs. 30% for a normal April weekend)</p></li><li><p>Average booking was $269 (only 10% above the prior week)</p></li></ul><p>An interesting detail: most of the Airbnb rentals were booked two months in advance, which is why the customers locked in a good price. Major hotel/motel chains — much more business conscious — jacked up prices by 50% to 100%. </p><p>When you add up the higher occupancy and slight room rate bump, the solar eclipse was a cumulative revenue bump of $44m for Airbnb/VRBO. My napkin math says these homeowners left ~$10m on the table by not doing a hotel chain mark-up. Now I just need to wait 20 years to jump on this vacation deal.</p><p><span>PS.
