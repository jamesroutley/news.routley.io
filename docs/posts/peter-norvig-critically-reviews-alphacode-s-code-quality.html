          <div><div><p>One exciting exception was a short-eared owl, which flew over with a group of carrion crows in hot pursuit on the 17th. The last record for this migrant was in 2018, curiously on exactly the same date!</p>
<p>A <strong>yellow-legged gull (above)</strong> which had been seen at the end of October as seen a couple of times at the start of November, visiting to have a wash and a bit of a loaf around as most gulls here do. An adult <strong>great black-backed gull</strong> was also seen on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.</p>
<p>The most interesting duck of the month was a male <strong>wigeon (below)</strong> seen on the 19<sup>th</sup>, with the highest count of <strong>shoveler</strong> being fifteen and<strong> teal</strong> being four.</p>
