    <h1>Chrome, 10 Years Later</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



<p>It&#39;s been around 10 years since I worked on Chrome. Here are some stories that
have surely been embellished by my own memory over that decade of distance.
Treat them all as only maybe 60% true. I figured I could at least write them
down before I totally forget them.</p>
<p><strong>What I did.</strong> I worked on Chrome from the early days, from 2007 to 2012, which
just about covers the second half of my twenties. I had other stuff going on in
my life, of course — including, for example, my wedding — but in terms of
anything I did with my life that the larger world cares about, Chrome is what I
fed my twenties to. Today it has more than 2.5 billion users. It&#39;s still a weird
feeling to go to a cafe and see the person next to me have &#34;my&#34; software up on
their screen.</p>
<p>I joined the project with the goal to make Linux Chrome a thing, which meant
first working on Windows-only Chrome for some years before eventually leading
the Linux team. Inevitably when a project is new you end up touching stuff all
over it — I remember writing the code to make the &#34;star&#34; button light up when
you clicked it, for example, which just entailed a new boolean of state and an
additional image resource — but one of my larger lasting legacies is
<a href="https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2020/05/ninja.html">the build system we ended up with</a>.</p>
<p>I kept a
<a href="https://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/archive.html">blog about Chrome</a>
for most of those years with a lot of technical details. See
<a href="https://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2008/12/first-post.html">my first public post</a>
there. My
<a href="https://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2012/02/the-end.html">farewell post about why I left</a>
talks more about my personal history.</p>
<p><strong>Why was I there?</strong> I came in to Google and Chrome thinking of myself as a
member of the free software community. In college we used
<a href="http://www.bradfitz.com/programming/hacks/gnomie/">crazy hacks involving running a Windows computer alongside your Linux one</a>
just to get a working browser because the web <em>required</em> Windows-only Internet
Explorer. As Brad wrote there: &#34;I&#39;ve waited for Mozilla [the pre-Firefox open
source release] to not suck for over a year&#34;. I have a memory of being in my
dorm room failing to get Mozilla to build on Linux and thinking to myself that
one day I could fix this. Chrome gave me exactly that opportunity.</p>
<p>Ironically, I think I ended up in the opposite place: I learned through painful
experience the structural reasons why user-facing software on Linux, both
Mozilla’s and mine, generally isn’t great. And similarly I learned how free
software can come from a place of giving and gratitude and end up as yet another
weapon for corporations. In retrospect it&#39;s an old trope, where I tried to
&#34;change the system from within&#34; and ended up becoming consumed by it.</p>
<p><strong>Why was Google there?</strong> With today&#39;s success it feels obvious in retrospect,
but at the time it seemed really crazy for Google to build a browser. (At the
time it was even a recurring joke within the company about how it would never
happen.)</p>
<p>History will surely uncover a Machiavellian plot about usurping control over the
web, but at the time the story was pretty simple, at least as it was explained
to naive pawns like me. Google wanted the web to succeed and even had a team of
people contributing to Firefox. Google wanted more influence over the product,
Mozilla was (reasonably) uncomfortable with that, so we went our own way. It’s
easy to read some sort of great conflict in that but I still don’t see it. As
far as I understand it — it happened after my time — the WebKit fork was the
same thing: they wanted WebKit to do things Apple didn’t and eventually it was
too much.</p>
<p>There was a second subplot about how Microsoft was increasingly turning to nasty
practices to get back at Google, and fears about using IE to pull some
anti-Google shenanigans. At the time I think a Windows update was resetting your
search engine, but Microsoft
<a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2018/09/12/microsoft-intercepting-firefox-chrome-installation-on-windows-10/">does this kind of stuff all the time</a>.
You can read Valve’s attempts at a Linux-based OS as a similar sort of defense
against the Windows app store. I know Microsoft today is supposed to be cool
again or whatever but I still remember the 90s, and I&#39;m regularly reminded by
how vicious and petty companies can be.</p>
<p>Third, even if Chrome was a total failure the hope was that it would light a
fire under the other browsers, and I think it did; nobody really cared about
JavaScript benchmarks until v8 came out. (You can interpret Google Fiber as
trying the same thing, though I don’t have much insight into that.) It’s easy to
forget how bad the web was back then, but Chrome came out during the three year
pause between IE7 and IE8.</p>
<p><strong>Why did it succeed?</strong> Obviously having Google pour resources
(engineering/advertising) into it was a big component. But it’s also the case
that Google pours resources into plenty of things that go on to not succeed.</p>
<p>That is in fact one of the things I take solace in when I feel grim about
technology: even with all the money in the world, company X still cannot make a
Y that customers love. You can substitute in your own X/Y for whichever megacorp
you’re feeling bad about. Amusingly, when I was first drafting this paragraph,
the news came out that Google gave up on its Facebook clone, as if to perfectly
demonstrate this point. Or think of Microsoft and Amazon’s attempts at phones.</p>
<p>As best as you can be objective about the thing, I think I can say that the
original product we launched was genuinely good software. Some of the things we
did, like OS-level sandbox isolation between pages, took literally years for any
other browser to implement.</p>
<p>And a big part of that is because we had some unexpectedly great engineers show
up. It&#39;s neat to ponder over how for however many people you know about from
their internet presence, there is a sort of &#34;dark matter&#34; of other super smart
people you never hear about. For one example I think of the very talented
Antoine, author of
<a href="http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2009/05/plugins-diagram.html">gnarly comments like these</a>
and
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5220931">seniormost person on ChromeOS</a>,
who appears to be otherwise mostly invisible on the internet.</p>
<p>Sometimes I suspect that my own biggest contribution to the project overall was
just inviting <a href="https://www.imperialviolet.org/">agl</a> to work on it. (In
retrospect, did I? Maybe it was all his own plans within plans...)</p>
<p>But I’ve also seen plenty of good engineers make unsuccessful software. If I try
to pinpoint the one thing we had that other projects I’ve worked with have
lacked I think I’d call it <em>alignment:</em> the product had a clear purpose that
everyone knew and were all heading in that direction. I have a memory of
second-guessing some random design detail and
<a href="http://www.glenmurphy.com/">Glen</a>, our designer, describing all the factors
he&#39;d balanced to make the particular design decisions he had. From that point
forward I had such confidence that he knew exactly what he was doing.</p>
<p>Maybe this is just saying that we had good leadership. Sorry to not have a more
specific secret recipe for success. There’s of course always a massive luck
component.</p>
<p><strong>The Glenhead.</strong> Chrome originally was Windows-only and had very
Windows-looking buttons in its custom title bar. I had been nagging Glen to give
us some Linuxy buttons, and as a prank I
<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/08/05/chromes-new-feature-click-the-ui-designer-to-close-the-window/">replaced the close button with his face</a>.</p>
<p>In retrospect... I still think this is funny. Though also I learned the reason
he hadn&#39;t given me the buttons I wanted was because he was stressed for time
about something else at the time, so it was a little inconsiderate of me. But I
think he today also thinks it&#39;s funny so it&#39;s all good.</p>
<p><strong>Polish.</strong> When we were about to ship the very first Chrome release we picked a
release date and did the standard &#34;burn down the last bugs you can and throw
everything else overboard&#34; as the date approached. For example I had worked on
an RSS-related feature that we jettisoned at launch time and never brought back.
And then some unrelated crisis occurred — how sad is it that I cannot remember
which? some news story that would&#39;ve overshadowed ours, in any case — which
caused us to delay the release for a month.</p>
<p>This gave us an additional month where we couldn&#39;t really add features, but
instead just had leeway to polish the thing, fixing all those last-minute detail
bugs that you normally wouldn&#39;t have time for. In retrospect that is a rare
relief for a product and I think it made the initial release more impressive
than it otherwise would&#39;ve been. It&#39;s strange how important polish can be for
some products, when simultaneously it&#39;s so hard to motivate prioritizing polish
work over feature work in general.</p>
<p><strong>The comic.</strong> I am briefly in the
<a href="https://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/">Chrome comic</a> on page 22/23. It was
pretty cool to meet Scott McCloud. His book Understanding Comics is really
great, worth your time. I&#39;m pictured giving an example for Incognito mode around
surprise gifts but I&#39;m pretty sure the example I would&#39;ve given is porn, not
that that would surprise anyone.</p>
<p>The intent was to ship the comic at the same time we shipped the browser, as a
sort of supporting document for the release. Due to a (shipping?) mistake,
someone got the comic before we released the actual product, so there was a bit
of press around the contents of the comic separately from reviews of the
browser. In retrospect this was kinda great because it meant excited reviewers
first engaged with the ideas of the product without being distracted by the
visual details of it.</p>
<p><strong>Version control.</strong> We initially developed Chrome using the Perforce version
control system used for code at Google, then at some point switched to an
internally hosted SVN in anticipation of publishing it as open source on
Google&#39;s public SVN hosting service at launch time. When it came time to
actually launch we discovered that the service wasn&#39;t designed to scale to a
project as large as Chrome, which led to a fire drill around how to actually
publish the code.</p>
<p>We ended up renting servers outside of Google&#39;s network and doing our own
sysadminning of them. I recall personally getting tasked with figuring out how
to block IPs from Iran — some dumb legal requirement around crypto exports —
and hacking up a xinetd script. This story is probably the sort of thing that is
familiar to anyone working at startups, but it was pretty abnormal in the
context of Google where server management was extremely custom, well understood,
and managed centrally. I think we couldn&#39;t use even Google hardware because it
was such a foreign idea to run non-Google software in our own data centers, or
something like that! It was definitely one of the most seat of the pants things
I can remember working on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was a version control nerd (I have written software using all of
the weird ones — monotone, darcs, tla!) and was pretty certain that Git was
going to be a big thing. So I wrote the Git-related tooling for working on
Chrome to integrate it with our SVN-based code review process etc. In retrospect
I think of this as a failure of leadership on my part. Many years later when
Chrome eventually inevitably switched to using Git only, I think it was a
multi-year project to dig out from SVN. Had I spent a little bit of time
advocating for something that was pretty obvious to me I would&#39;ve saved those
people a lot of time.</p>
<p>Since I&#39;m on the subject of being a version control nerd, here&#39;s a bonus fun
esoteric Git feature: within Google I used
<a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GraftPoint">git grafts</a> to splice
together the P4 and multiple SVN histories together into one big continuous
history, which sometimes ended up being useful for code archaeology via
<code>git blame</code>. I guess today that combined history might be something like 16
years long!</p>
<p><strong>Working with Apple.</strong> About half of Chrome&#39;s code was our fork of WebKit,
which we reintegrated into Apple’s upstream after Chrome released (only to
eventually permanently fork again many years later, after my time). This meant
that, shortly after our release, changes we made needed to be approved by Apple
engineers.</p>
<p>In retrospect I enjoyed this a lot, for two reasons. One is that getting code
review from experienced engineers is one of the best ways to grow as a
programmer, and the Apple engineers came from a totally foreign engineering
culture — no unit tests! no comments! — that also was clearly producing a
high-quality product. The second is that the Apple approval process was a gate
on us stuffing random Chrome-specific things into the web platform; you had to
make the case that it made sense for Apple too.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t do much work in this area and I know it was the source of a
lot of stress for others, in part because our fundamental goals were so
divergent. While the individual engineers might disagree with this
characterization, I think it&#39;s not a stretch to say that structurally Apple
cares about making a browser that renders web pages just adequately enough to be
acceptable and that real applications belong outside the browser. There were
plenty of technical disagreements too. Maybe I just got lucky or I&#39;ve forgotten,
but I mostly have warm memories of the code reviews I got.</p>
<p>I mention all of this also to reflect on one especially weird part of all of
this. At some point I was told to not offer jobs to anyone at Apple. The rumor
was that we had successfully recruited someone important from the WebKit team
and Steve Jobs personally flipped his lid about it. Years later I learned this
was part of an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Tech_Employee_Antitrust_Litigation">industry wide illegal agreement</a>.
I eventually got a class action settlement check for something like $12k that I
guess was meant to cover the wages I&#39;d lost.</p>
<p><strong>Missing stair.</strong> Years later at a party I met someone from Apple who worked on
WebKit and I said, &#34;Oh neat! I worked on Chrome so I touched that code too.&#34; And
they asked: &#34;What was the deal with [person X] on your team, why are they such a
jerk?&#34; (Sadly, if you worked on Chrome you probably know exactly who I&#39;m talking
about.) The experience gave me an appreciation for how a group, especially a
faceless internet group, can be perceived by its worst behavior.</p>
<p><strong>My &#34;interview&#34;.</strong> At one point I returned from a vacation to find an email
that said: &#34;A Linux magazine wanted an interview with you but you were away so
we wrote the responses for you, you can edit them if you like.&#34; In retrospect
this was really not ok and I&#39;m not sure why I didn&#39;t make a big fuss about it.
You can still read &#34;my&#34; responses in
<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/magazine/google-chrome-making-cross-platform-browser">the article</a>,
complete with eye-rollers like like &#34;We built Google Chrome because we believed
we could add real value for users&#34;.</p>
<p><strong>Reward.</strong> Google had
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Founders%27_Award">a program</a> where they&#39;d
occasionally give large stock grants, outside of the normal compensation, as
rewards for projects that were exceptional in some way. We got one — maybe the
last? — for Chrome. (I wrote &#34;last&#34; but it&#39;s plausible to me they kept giving
these kinds of awards just without announcing them.)</p>
<p>I mention this because when we learned we got the award, and each person was
told how much they would get, one of the most senior people on the team
announced soon after that he was leaving the company. I remember being surprised
by it and asking him about it. His response has stayed with me, something along
the lines of: &#34;Once I knew the highest upside I would get for staying, I could
better evaluate it against my other options.&#34;</p>
<p>I think there&#39;s a lesson there about how rewards can have the opposite effect
you intend. And similarly, while I can see why a company might want to give out
of line bonuses for behavior they&#39;d like to reward, it ends up feeling gross for
a company to dangle the potential of a future reward to retain people.</p>
<p><strong>Web apps vs native.</strong> We take for granted today that you can build real
software on the web. But here’s a story to maybe illustrate the era: at the time
we launched Chrome, we had a search feature where the browser would display a
tab that showed links and text snippets, like a web search results page.
(<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17745931">More on this feature, which is gone now</a>.)</p>
<p>I remember writing native UI code to do our own custom text layout and clickable
links for that, despite the intended appearance and behavior of the page looking
just like a web-based search results page. This is to say, at the time using
HTML to implement anything you cared about seemed horrible, even to us browser
developers, even for UI that was supposed to behave like a web page!</p>
<p>From my experience on that project I later did some of the work in Chrome to
expose HTML-based browser UI and I remember advocating for it within the team.
Since then a lot of the browser&#39;s UI is implemented in HTML. (Do you remember
that Chrome&#39;s settings UI used to be all-native?) Of course, now in today&#39;s
Electron world it&#39;s becoming increasingly rare for a desktop application to
<em>not</em> be implemented in HTML...</p>
<p><strong>Chrome vs the web.</strong> When we were small, sites wouldn’t work around our bugs.
We had to work for them.
<a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28350">Here&#39;s a WebKit hack that specifically worked around a bug in MediaWiki (aka Wikipedia)</a>.
It was added in 2009 (!) and hung around for a decade.</p>
<p>At one point the question came up: how many redirects should a browser follow?
Say you try to load A, but it redirects you to B, which redirects to C, and so
on; at some point you should give up and say something is broken. Someone picked
some reasonable-seeming threshold, like 10 or so, after which Chrome would give
up. Then Darin, who had previously worked on Firefox, said &#34;no, it has to be 30,
or it breaks the New York Times — I know this from experience&#34;. (Today Darin is
working on
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/31/23428862/arc-browser-web-company-darin-fisher">another browser</a>,
hopefully getting a third use out of that hard-won lesson.)</p>
<p>Then Chrome became big and sites started testing to make sure they worked around
Chrome’s bugs. Then Chrome became enormous and started dictating what sites are
allowed to do. I think this can come from a good place (for example,
<a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-why-your-static-website-needs-https/">why even static websites actually need https</a>)
but it makes me anxious because there’s no structural reason these decisions
ought to be good.</p>
<p>I have read that one reason the US government is so ineffective is that the
founders intentionally designed it to be hard to make changes, under the
reasoning that it’s more important to defend against tyrants making sudden
changes than it is to change the law easily. The web moves more quickly, but
we&#39;re mostly relying on the benevolence (or equivalently, we&#39;re victims of the
malevolence) of a few dictatorial actors. The failure of the standards process
that led to the HTML5 schism demonstrates why having an arbitrary body define
standards also doesn’t work — it’s a similar problem of aligning incentives. I
think there is no easy answer.</p>
<p><strong>ChromeOS.</strong> I remember getting asked if I wanted to work on this &#34;Chrome OS&#34;
idea — my baby Linux Chrome was an important piece of it — and being really
skeptical about it.</p>
<p>But ChromeOS surprised me in how great it turned out, particularly on the
security and updates front. They somehow managed to again get the right people
in the right places to make a genuinely impressive thing.</p>
<p><strong>Chrome today.</strong> Once we got Linux Chrome mostly working I think I didn’t
realize that my work was done. At the time I’d joke that &#34;Chrome 12 [an old
version] was the best Chrome&#34;, but since I’ve come to see underneath that for me
what I wanted was a fast tight browser, and once I had that, pretty much by
definition most subsequent work was just gonna make it worse. Sure, there’s work
like fixing rendering crashes or improving scroll performance, but most work
involves adding features that make it bigger or slower.</p>
<p>Longer term, what I have come to appreciate about this is that I put a lot of
myself into the product and I am proud of what I made at the time, but that
product is a living thing that I do not control and it has gone on in directions
I wouldn’t have taken it. I&#39;m especially disappointed (or maybe &#34;distraught&#34; is
a better word) by Google&#39;s progressively more casual relationship with privacy.
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220403221317/https://toolbar.google.com/prdlg.html">Old Google was a lot more respectful</a>
than what you see today.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also funny to reflect on how much time we spent agonizing over making the
most minimal thing — Chrome initially had no &#34;Home&#34; button and I remember there
being long arguments about whether adding it even as an option was contrary to
the goal of the thing — vs today&#39;s browser which is covered with buttons and
settings, just like the browsers it was intending to revolt against.</p>
<p><strong>The fate of the web.</strong> I am kinda gloomy about the web. After Chrome I worked
for three years on a product whose founding goal was trying to figure out some
way to &#34;save newspapers&#34;.</p>
<p>Everybody hates ads but nobody has a plausible plan for how journalism gets
funded; that project tried a thing that I think also didn’t work out. Inevitably
in discussions like these someone will say something unhelpful like &#34;if the
newspaper had reasonable payment systems I’d pay for them&#34; or whatever but the
gulf between hand-waving about this and actually making the numbers work out is
massive.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s web feels like it&#39;s in a similar spiral to the bottom around ads. It&#39;s
possible to make some pretty neat stuff using web technologies — witness Figma,
for example — but it&#39;s easier to make user-hostile garbage and so that is what
we usually get.</p>
<p>People seem to think it&#39;s the browser&#39;s job to block ads, but my perspective is
that if a business owner wants to make their business repulsive, the only
sensible response is to stop using the business. Somehow once technology is
involved to abstract what&#39;s happening, people start talking about how it&#39;s their
right to unilaterally renegotiate the transaction. Or for another analogy that
will likely make you upset: &#34;I hate how this store charges $10 for a banana, so
I am just going to pay $2 and take the banana anyway&#34;.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only real non-web platforms are run by companies
(Apple/Google/Microsoft) who aren’t afraid to stomp on competitors, often in
ways that are illegal or that ought to be. Just in this post I have instances of
all of those companies behaving badly. So maybe I&#39;m just gloomy about where
technology is headed in general!</p>
