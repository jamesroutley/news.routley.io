    <h1>NASA Puts Jet Propulsion Lab on Blast over Psyche Mission Failures</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>This independent review board pulled no punches. </h2><h2>On Sight</h2><p>The California Institute of Technology&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory is on notice from NASA after a review found serious staffing issues that led to the Psyche Mission failing to launch.</p><p>As multiple NASA-watchers have noted, the agency seems mighty upset with the JPL after <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/psyche_irb_report_and_response_nov_2022.pdf">an independent review board</a> found that several issues at the lab led to the repeated slip of the launch of the <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/nasa-psyche-mission-peril">Psyche Mission</a>, which is set to investigate a rare metal asteroid that could be worth a reported $10 quintillion dollars if mined.</p><p>According to the report, which was conducted by a 15-person team <a href="https://psyche.asu.edu/2022/07/14/nasa-begins-psyche-mission-review/">led by retired NASA heavy hitter Tom Young</a>, the JPL didn&#39;t have enough experienced staff to cover Psyche. Moreover, it found, the lab&#39;s management didn&#39;t give it enough attention. Some &#34;major communication failures&#34; between levels of management seemed to exacerbate it all.</p><p>Additionally, the &#34;post-pandemic work environment&#34; seemed to create further issues with the project, the report found. All together, these problems &#34;are having a significant adverse impact on the implementation of JPL flight projects.&#34;</p><h2>Ring the Alarm</h2><p>The report notes that although Psyche team members &#34;raised alarms&#34; about these issues, they didn&#39;t think anyone at any level of management was actually taking them seriously. It&#39;s hard to argue with that assessment given that, per the report, the project&#39;s managers didn&#39;t recognize these problems &#34;until it was too late to resolve them in time for a 2022 launch.&#34;</p><p>&#34;A culture of &#39;prove there is a problem&#39; led to important issues raised by team members being disregarded,&#34; the report added.</p><p>NASA&#39;s Planetary Science Division Director, Dr. Lori Glaze, said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag6tqWaTVlE">during a press conference</a> that the VERITAS Venus Mission is going to have to be delayed from 2028 to 2031 due to issues caused by JPL&#39;s failure to launch Psyche (which is now <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/nasa-launch-date-10-quintillion-asteroid">set to be launched next fall</a>).</p><p>&#34;Corrective actions are urgently needed,&#34; the report concluded, &#34;and failure to act will result in more &#39;Psyches&#39; and potentially in-flight failures.&#34;</p><p>Such accusations are jarring to hear — but in the age of <a href="https://futurism.com/scathing-report-nasa-behind-moon-landing">repeated mission slips</a>, they&#39;ll undoubtedly be taken seriously.</p><p><strong>More on NASA: </strong><a href="https://futurism.com/meteorite-mars-nasa-quake"><em>Meteorite Hit Mars So Hard NASA Thought It Was a Quake</em></a></p></div></div>
