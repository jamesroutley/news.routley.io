I&#39;m hyped you&#39;re here, but this game wasn&#39;t designed for small screens, and you will <i>not</i> enjoy attempting it. I mean, would you write code on your phone? Actually, don&#39;t answer, because I don&#39;t want to know. Anyway, hope to see you soon on a desktop.</p><p>-Marcos</p></div></div></div>
