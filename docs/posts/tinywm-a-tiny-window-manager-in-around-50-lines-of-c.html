    <h1>TinyWM â€“ A tiny window manager in around 50 lines of C</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <div>
                    <p>TinyWM is a tiny window manager that I created as an exercise in minimalism.  It is also maybe helpful in learning some of the very basics of creating a window manager.  It is only around 50 lines of C.  There is also a Python version using python-xlib.</p>

<p>It lets you do four basic things:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Move windows interactively with Alt+Button1 drag (left mouse button)</li>
 <li>Resize windows interactively with Alt+Button3 drag (right mouse button)</li>
 <li>Raise windows with Alt+F1 (not high on usability I know, but I needed a keybinding in there somewhere)</li>
 <li>Focus windows with the mouse pointer (X does this on its own)</li>
</ol>

Here is annotated.c, which is just tinywm.c with a lot of comments explaining what is going on.  This should give you a reasonable idea of how everything works.

/* much of tinywm&#39;s purpose is to serve as a very basic example of how to do X
 * stuff and/or understand window managers, so i wanted to put comments in the
 * code explaining things, but i really hate wading through code that is
 * over-commented -- and for that matter, tinywm is supposed to be as concise
 * as possible, so having lots of comments just wasn&#39;t really fitting for it.
 * i want tinywm.c to be something you can just look at and go &#34;wow, that&#39;s
 * it?  cool!&#34;  so what i did was just copy it over to annotated.c and comment
 * the hell out of it.  ahh, but now i have to make every code change twice!
 * oh well.  i could always use some sort of script to process the comments out
 * of this and write it to tinywm.c ... nah.
