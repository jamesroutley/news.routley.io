    <h1>Sometimes Software Is Done, or Why Hugo Why (2024)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
                    <p>I didn’t sit down this morning planning to write a grouchy blog post about Hugo.</p>
<p>When I first used Hugo I loved it. It was fast. It was simple. It just worked, as much as any software does, and it solved a real problem.</p>
<p>It was done.</p>
<hr/>
<p>But people kept working on it.</p>
<p>I’m sure that it has been improved in countless ways. But along the way it has gotten bigger and more complicated, and has broken backwards compatibility repeatedly.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I am only inspired to write a blog post every few months. It takes a lot of self control to forgo the glittering pile of side projects and use my precious free time to write some words instead of code.</p>
<p>I commit to myself: Today is the day! I will finally tackle one of the items from my blog post idea list!</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>I run <code>hugo</code>…</p>
<p>And it scribbles all over my files, a slew of unimportant changes, unfortunately occasionally interspersed with a few that matter…</p>
<p>And it warns me of new deprecations, often with unusable upgrade instructions…</p>
<p>And things flat out break.</p>
<p>(Often, they were deprecated and then broken entirely between two subsequent blog posts, so I never ever saw the deprecation.)</p>
<p>Instead of writing a blog post, I spend hours fixing build failures.</p>
<p>Build failures of my static site, which has maybe a few dozen posts.</p>
<p>I don’t care about Hugo’s internals. I have never cared. I just want a blog that works.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Enough complaining. Hugo is officially on the chopping block. Suggestions for alternatives welcome.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, I’ll just compile Hugo myself from source, never update it, and live in the ever receding past.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Backwards compatibility matters. And sometimes, software is done.</p>
