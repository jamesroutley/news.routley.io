    <h1>The Canon Cat: the little computer that could have changed the world</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-tag="post-content">
<p>This time we are looking at a somewhat obscure machine: the
Canon Cat. Designed by Jef Raskin, the Cat is sometimes called the
spiritual successor to the Macintosh. That&#39;s a nice little epitaph,
but doesn&#39;t fully explain the tangled mess of things between
Raskin, Jobs, Apple, and the Mac. Today we will try to untangle
some of that mess as we examine a fascinating little computer that
could have changed the world.</p>
