    <h1>LWN Is Hiring</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<div><p>
LWN does its best to provide comprehensive coverage of the free-software
development community, but there is far more going on than our small staff
can handle.  When expressed that way, this problem suggests an obvious
solution: make the staff bigger.  Thus, LWN is looking to hire a
writer/editor.
</p><p>
The job description is appended below, but LWN readers will already know
what we are looking for: writers who can create our type of clearly
written, technical coverage of what the community is up to.  Our writers
must understand how free software is made and distributed, and they must be
prepared to write for an audience that knows more than they do.  It is
challenging, but also a lot of fun.
</p><p>
While we hope to find somebody who can cover a broad spectrum of
free-software development, we also wish to find somebody who can complement
and deepen our coverage in one or more of the following areas:
</p><ul>
<li> Distribution development and project governance
</li><li> The development of the Rust language
</li><li> Language, toolchain, and low-level library development in general
</li><li> Linux kernel development
</li><li> Embedded systems and Android
</li><li> System-administration tools and containers
</li></ul>
<p>
The above list is not exhaustive; we would certainly be interested in
talking with authors whose passion takes them into a different area.
</p><p>
LWN will complete 25 years of publication next January.  It has been a
spectacular ride and we have no intention of stopping, but there will come
a time where, if this show is to go on, a new generation will need to take
over.  We would like to get that generation in place and up to speed well
before the situation becomes urgent.  Today&#39;s new writers, we hope, will
become tomorrow&#39;s senior editors.
</p><p>
If this appeals to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:editorjob@lwn.net"><tt>editorjob@lwn.net</tt></a>.  If you
know somebody else who might make a good candidate, please encourage them
to talk to us.  The free-software community shows no signs of slowing down
anytime soon; with your help, LWN will be able to keep up with it for the
next quarter-century — and beyond.
</p><h4>The job description</h4>
<p>
LWN.net is seeking a full-time technical journalist to provide high-quality
coverage of the Linux and free-software communities for our readers.  This
is an opportunity to be a part of a community that has changed the world
and is far from finished.  LWN has been covering this community from within
since 1998.
</p><p>
Responsibilities will include finding and researching topics, writing
articles on a regular schedule, reviewing articles written by others,
interacting with readers, and traveling to and reporting from
community events.  Additionally, we all take part in the tasks of running
the business and making important decisions about where we are trying to
go.
</p><p>
Requirements include:
</p><ul>
<li> A university degree in technical writing, engineering, or the sciences —
   or equivalent experience.

</li><li> Top-level English writing and editing skills.

</li><li> The willingness and ability to work remotely full-time.

</li><li> An understanding of free software and the communities that create it.

</li><li> A willingness to take on a wide range of challenges in a small-company
   environment.
</li></ul>
<p>
We would also like to see:
</p><ul>
<li> A demonstrated history of writing for a highly technical audience.

</li><li> Software development experience, especially in the form of contribution
   to one or more free-software projects.

</li><li> Experience with web technologies and web-site design.

</li><li> Python development experience.
</li></ul>
<p>

LWN is located in Colorado, but we are willing to consider applicants from
anywhere in the US who can legally work here.  Compensation includes
participation in our health and 401(k) retirement plans.  Applicants from
the rest of the world who can work as consultants can also be considered.<br clear="all"/></p><hr/><p>
