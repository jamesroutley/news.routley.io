    <h1>Tell HN: iOS lets carriers add WiFi networks that you can’t stop from joining</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Well this was a major surprise so I figured I’d share it here to get some eyeballs on it.</p><p>Essentially, the latest iOS (16.4 at post time) allows your cellular carrier (via eSIM) to add “managed networks” to your device.</p><p>These networks cannot be removed, they cannot have “automatically join” disabled, and they have equal priority with your real, personal networks.</p><p>So guess what happens when your neighbors get a wifi/modem combo that blasts a free hotspot SSID? Not only does it pollute the already crowded 2.4ghz band, your iPhone will often prefer this connection over your real /local wifi (despite said wifi being at 1 bar).</p><p>As of post-time, there is no way to remove these networks short of completely disabling cell service/removing the eSIM and resetting all network settings.</p><p>You can see this for yourself by going to WiFi/“edit” and scrolling down.</p><p>Edit: to clarify, I can disable “auto join”, but in 4-5 minutes all of my devices have auto-join turned back on. I’m guessing it re-syncs with the carrier profile. Also, this does not seem to be eSIM or SIM related it can happen on both.</p></div></div></div>
