Its articles were just too technical and advanced for my young self. It also didn’t really have that much in the way of Atari coverage.</p><p>However, in March 1986 they published my favorite issue of Byte ever, the one with the Atari 1040ST on the cover:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76375502-aad1-49dd-868c-a6a7affa7d89_769x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76375502-aad1-49dd-868c-a6a7affa7d89_769x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76375502-aad1-49dd-868c-a6a7affa7d89_769x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76375502-aad1-49dd-868c-a6a7affa7d89_769x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76375502-aad1-49dd-868c-a6a7affa7d89_769x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76375502-aad1-49dd-868c-a6a7affa7d89_769x1024.jpeg" width="769" height="1024" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/76375502-aad1-49dd-868c-a6a7affa7d89_769x1024.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1024,&#34;width&#34;:769,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:379085,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76375502-aad1-49dd-868c-a6a7affa7d89_769x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76375502-aad1-49dd-868c-a6a7affa7d89_769x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76375502-aad1-49dd-868c-a6a7affa7d89_769x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F76375502-aad1-49dd-868c-a6a7affa7d89_769x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>My dog-eared copy of Byte, March 1986 purchased in 1986.</figcaption></figure></div><p>1986 was a gangbuster year for Atari and it was also the best year for Byte magazine’s Atari coverage. In January they published a product preview of the Atari 520ST, in March one for the 1040ST. They published a review of the 520ST in June. The ST made the cover again (along with the Amiga and Mac) in September.</p><p><span>In 1986 they actually started including ST news! There were also occasional ST-related articles (</span><a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1986-09/page/n234/mode/1up" rel="">Atari ST Software Development in September</a><span>) and some of the columns regularly mentioned the ST. Bruce Webster did a 68000 Wars series in his column, comparing the ST, Amiga and Mac. Jerry Pournelle would often mention the ST in his Chaos Manor column. Plus when they added BIX</span></p><p><span> summaries, they included an Atari ST section.</span></p><p>Back in 1986, I actually bought quite a few issues of Byte at the newsstand because of this ($3.50 cover price back then, about $10 today).</p><p>Today I have a decent-sized collection of Byte magazines, including the entire 1986 year. I also have the entire 1985 year and other random issues between 1979 and 1983 which all together totals 42 issues.</p><p>Even if Byte was generally not a great source of Atari content, if you were into computers at all, it could be interesting. Each issue of Byte had a theme, which many of the articles would touch on in some way. But this also meant that if you didn’t like the theme, you might not like most of the issue’s content.</p><p>Even today, I find some issues engrossing and others I just skip through pretty quickly.</p><p>I often enjoyed Byte’s reviews. They seemed to review a lot of oddball computers that I’d never heard of. Reviews were also almost always notoriously late. For example, the Atari 520ST review was published a year after it was released! Same with the Amiga review, which was published in October 1986, about a year after it was released and over a year after they had their first preview of in in August 1985.</p><p>The columnists also had lead times that were several months. Byte was not a place to get breaking news!</p><p>Looking at 1985 for example, there was a review of the Atari 800XL in March. What was I saying about late? The 800XL came out in fall of 1983! It was a good review, mentioning BASIC XL and Action!, two great languages. Also in March, they had a blurb in the news section about the newly announced ST series.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefcc80e3-4d98-4204-ac16-c56275a8f716_769x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefcc80e3-4d98-4204-ac16-c56275a8f716_769x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefcc80e3-4d98-4204-ac16-c56275a8f716_769x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefcc80e3-4d98-4204-ac16-c56275a8f716_769x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefcc80e3-4d98-4204-ac16-c56275a8f716_769x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefcc80e3-4d98-4204-ac16-c56275a8f716_769x1024.jpeg" width="769" height="1024" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/efcc80e3-4d98-4204-ac16-c56275a8f716_769x1024.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1024,&#34;width&#34;:769,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:266264,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefcc80e3-4d98-4204-ac16-c56275a8f716_769x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefcc80e3-4d98-4204-ac16-c56275a8f716_769x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefcc80e3-4d98-4204-ac16-c56275a8f716_769x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fefcc80e3-4d98-4204-ac16-c56275a8f716_769x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Atari ST mentioned in What’s New</figcaption></figure></div><p>As I re-read these, I noticed that their reviews of computers did also not do a great job of quoting comparable prices, though. For example, the Atari 800XL review quotes a price of $1200 for a system with two disk drives and a monitor. That might have been its price in 1983, but it certainly was not its price in 1985. Of course, keeping up with rapid price changes in the 80s was difficult.</p><p>But why quote two drives and a monitor for an 800XL? Most people would be using a TV. Byte didn’t always quote prices like that. For example, the Amiga review quotes a price of $1300, which was the base price with one drive and no monitor. I can see one drive, but you really needed a monitor to use the Amiga. The Atari 520ST review quotes a price of $1000 for a system with one drive and a color monitor, which seems the most reasonable.</p><p>The IBM PC AT review also quotes only a single drive in one of the prices and no monitor.</p><p>Similarly, in the March 1986 issue when they tout the 1040ST as the first computer under $1000 for a megabyte of RAM, they are using the $1000 list price for the system with a monochrome monitor. But in their graph, they quote the original Commodore 64 price of $595, which did not include a disk drive or monitor! If they had done the same for the 520ST and quote its price without a disk drive or monitor, it would have also been less than $1 per kilobyte!</p><p>None of these are remotely comparable! I suppose it had to do with different people doing the reviews, but it seems like the editorial staff could have updated the price charts better, especially with the long lead times.</p><p>Anyway, enough of my price ranting.</p><p>Byte was a thick magazine. Each issue was large, with 400 to 500 pages. There were plenty of in-depth articles, but at least half of the magazine was ads. I’m not complaining, everyone liked computer ads back then.</p><p>Taking a look at some of the older, issues shows a much nerdier magazine. Apparently, McGraw-Hill bought Byte in 1979 and the style started changing after that. The earliest issue I have is.</p><p>The final published issue of Byte was July 1998, but I had long since stopped reading it. It remained around in online form for a while longer.</p><p>You can find most issues of Byte in the Internet Archive.</p><p>Speaking of that, for Atari users, someone put together a PDF of all the Atari-related Byte content. The PDF is over 700 pages and starts with a news blurb from April 1979 and ends with the last Atari content being a news item with a first impression of the Falcon030 in February 1993.</p><p><a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-atari-articles/page/n1/mode/1up" rel="">Byte Magazine - Atari Articles</a></p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.goto10retro.com/p/a-bit-about-byte-magazine-the-premier?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.goto10retro.com/p/a-bit-about-byte-magazine-the-premier?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>Below are some highlights of some of my favorite articles and reviews.
