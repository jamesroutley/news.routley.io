    <h1>Setting Up For The Second Half of 2024</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2024/05/setting_up_for_h2_2024.jpg" alt="Setting Up For The Second Half of 2024"><p><em>Note: this was sent as a newsletter to Commoncog newsletter subscribers. Sign up for that </em><a href="https://commoncog.com/subscribe-to-the-commonplace-newsletter/"><em>here</em></a><em>!</em></p><p>Hi there!</p><p>I&#x2019;m currently writing this from an Airbnb in Kuala Lumpur where I&#x2019;m doing a retreat for 10 days. I&#x2019;m writing for five hours a day, and then training Judo for another five hours each day.</p><p>The goal? Apart from training hard with my old Judo coach, and revisiting some of the <a href="https://commoncog.com/mental-strength-judo-life/">lessons from my Judo experiment</a> a year ago, my goal is to finish the two essays on the Amazon-style Weekly Business Review (WBR).</p><p>As a result, this is a short post to say that you&#x2019;re going to get a sequence of cases over the next few weeks, at least until the WBR essays are done. I feel a sense of deep responsibility in getting the WBR essays <em>right</em>. I think there&#x2019;s only a handful of people who have implemented the Amazon-style WBR outside of Amazon, from scratch, and whilst most of them are far more experienced with it than I am, I suspect none of them are incentivised to write about the practice as urgently. So the essays are my <a href="https://commoncog.com/highest-order-bit/">high order bit</a>; I intend to finish them, polish them and get approval from Colin Bryar, and then release the essays as a way to close up the <a href="https://commoncog.com/becoming-data-driven-in-business/">Data Driven Series</a>.</p><p>But till then, you&#x2019;ll get a series of cases; so let&#x2019;s talk about that:</p><ol><li>I spent most of last year writing about <a href="https://commoncog.com/capital-expertise-in-business-series/">Capital Expertise</a>, and I want to revisit one particular aspect of it. In Part 7 of that series, we talked about a specific pattern to business success: that is, <a href="https://commoncog.com/capital-allocation-antidote-to-business-luck/">how skill at capital allocation can allow you to build a large business</a>, even if you don&#x2019;t succeed in finding a billion dollar idea with your initial attempt. I wrote that this is contrary to the vast majority of startup advice you get, mostly because such a strategy is designed to make you &#x2014; and only you &#x2014; rich. This year I want to examine this a bit more: how do companies become large through conglomeration? What does a good capital allocator look like, especially when they grow through rigorous acquisition? And what makes for a good conglomerate?</li><li>This sets us up for a second topic: the nature of Asian businesses. If you sit back and think about it, most large, successful Asian businesses are <em>conglomerates</em>. There is a reason for this. In 2022 I <a href="https://commoncog.com/2022-commoncog-recap/#chinese-businessmen-why-are-most-companies-in-asia-conglomerates">wrote</a> that I&#x2019;d like to explore this question in greater detail. Sequencing a series on &#x2018;Chinese businessmen&#x2019; (to use a phrase I <a href="https://commoncog.com/the-chinese-businessman-paradox/">once used</a>, years ago) after a sequence on conglomerates makes the topic slightly easier to write about.</li></ol><p>To that end, I&#x2019;m pleased to announce two concept sequences this week:</p><ol><li>A sequence on <a href="https://commoncog.com/c/concepts/capital-allocation/">Capital Allocation</a>, with cases on Danaher, Katharine Graham, Koch Industries, and TransDigm.</li><li>A sequence on <a href="https://commoncog.com/c/concepts/incentive-design/">Incentive Design</a>, with cases on Munger, Tolles, Olson and TransDigm (this is a repeat case).</li></ol><p>The vast majority of cases in the coming weeks will be added to these two concept sequences. Even if you&#x2019;ve read some of these cases before, I&#x2019;d encourage you to reread the cases in each sequence, in order &#x2014; with the concepts in mind. That helps with the pattern recognition aspect of business expertise (as we&#x2019;ve discussed, given Cognitive Flexibility Theory).</p><p>Earlier this year I <a href="https://commoncog.com/the-2023-commoncog-recap/">said</a> that Commoncog will shift to focus on the case library by the second half of the year. This is on-track &#x2014; I have a backlog of unpublished cases around conglomeration for this very reason &#x2014; but I&#x2019;m currently hiring writers and iterating on a scalable process for case production. This is taking up more of my time than expected. As a result, I&#x2019;m going to release cases without much synthesis for the next few weeks, at least until the WBR essays are out.</p><p>After which you should start to see more commentary. For now, assume that the cases are being released in a specific order, for unspecified reasons.</p><p>I&#x2019;ll have more to say soon.</p><p>Warmly,<br>Cedric</p>
