    <h1>The heaviness of maintaining systems</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The way people end up in operations has always intrigued me. Operations
always felt like “the things around the Thing” - a supporting cast that is important to
making something happen. I suppose without “the Thing” there isn’t as much of a need for
Ops work to be done. How do ops people thrive and grow as those who take care of the systems
around us, without letting the systems consume us?</p><p>Over the years I have noticed something in friends<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> who perform similar work: the skills that
make one particularly effective at this role often are picked up outside of tech. Things like
navigating unstable infrastructure, unstable personal relationships, or other unstable systems and
situations. Whether tech or personal, there is overlap in quickly understanding how systems come
together, reverse engineering, distilling clarity from complex code (or humans), communicating
calmly during incidents/emergency situations. But, the development of those skills come at a cost to
the person who had to learn and deploy these tools to create their own stability.</p><p>The “good news” is that these skills are often seen as ones “senior” engineers have, and under
the right conditions mixed with technical knowledge turns out to be in demand.
Robustness and resilience are things that People Are Very Interested In™ and anxiety (or trauma, or both)
can be synthesized into a career. It is good that these things contribute to keeping a roof
over one’s head in the economic system we currently exist in today. The flip side of this is that
there seems to be an inevitable march towards getting burnt out, especially for those who juggle
all these demands on the regular.</p><p>I am left with a lot of questions: In what ways are the systems we maintain mirrors of ourselves?
The system designs we push for (or don’t push for) or the debug mechanisms we try (or don’t try) are
collected over years of technical, familial, and social encounters. Is there a safe way to perform
this work for a lifetime and not burn out? Self-introspection is challenging for many reasons.
I’ve tried to start reflecting on what forces are motivating me
when I take on extra work, or jump into an incident, or engage in
<a href="http://noidea.dog/glue">glue work</a>. After that, though: what’s next? I don’t have any answers.</p><p><em>A number of people reviewed this post before I published it. I am thankful for their edits, thoughts, and insights.</em></p></div></div>
