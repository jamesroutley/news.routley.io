<p>Since the introduction of subscriptions 7 years ago, we have not increased the pricing of our IDEs, .NET Tools, or the All Products Pack. During this time, we have introduced new products that have been included at no extra cost to everyone using the latter. We are also one of the few companies that lowers the cost of subscriptions up to 40% when you renew. It is our way of thanking you for your loyalty.</p>



<p>However, we are at the point where we need to increase our subscription prices. The new prices will affect our IDEs, .NET Tools, dotUltimate, and the All Products Pack, and will come into effect on October 1, 2022. Both new and current prices are listed on the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/">website</a> pricing pages.</p>



<h3><strong>Prepay at the current price for more than one year</strong></h3>



<p>For both new and existing customers, we are extending the maximum permissible renewal period. This is now three years for individual subscriptions, and two years for business subscriptions. While this will require an upfront payment, it will allow you to renew at the current price for more than one year. </p>



<p><strong>Important: </strong><em>Please note that the new expiry date of your subscription will count from the day of renewal, and the price will be adjusted to account for any time you may have left on your current subscription. In other words, if you were to renew today for 2 years, but have 3 months left, the renewal price would be lowered to account for those 3 months. However, your subscription would expire in 2 years from now. </em></p>



<p>We understand that a price increase is not something any of us like. However, we’ll continue to do our best to minimize these, just like we said when we first introduced subscription pricing. </p>



<p>We will be reaching out to all our customers over the next few weeks with this update. </p>



<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
