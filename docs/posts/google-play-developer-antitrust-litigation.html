<p>A settlement has been reached with Google LLC, Google Ireland Limited, Google Commerce Limited, Google Asia Pacific Pte. Limited, and Google Payment Corp. (“Google”) in an antitrust class action lawsuit about the Google Play store. The lawsuit was brought by U.S. app developers. The lawsuit alleged that Google monopolized (or attempted to monopolize) alleged markets related to the distribution of Android OS apps and in-app products in violation of U.S. and California law. Google denies all allegations and the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing by Google. Both Plaintiffs and Google agreed to settle this case to move forward, avoid uncertain litigation, and provide support to the developer community.</p>

<p>You may be included in this settlement and entitled to receive a payment if you are or were a U.S. developer of any Android OS application or in-app product (including subscriptions) and satisfy the following criteria:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Sold an application or in-app product (including subscriptions) for a non-zero price between August 17, 2016 and December 31, 2021;</li>
	<li>Paid Google a service fee greater than 15% on at least one such transaction between August 17, 2016 and December 31, 2021; and</li>
	<li>Earned proceeds between U.S. $0 and U.S. $2,000,000.00 through Google Play in every calendar year between and inclusive of 2016 and 2021. For this purpose, the 2016 calendar year shall consist of August 17, 2016 through December 31, 2016.</li>
</ol>
