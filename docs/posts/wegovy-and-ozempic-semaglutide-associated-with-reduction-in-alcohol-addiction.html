    <h1>Wegovy and Ozempic (semaglutide) associated with reduction in alcohol addiction</h1>

GLP-1s have the potential to reach a dramatically higher percentage of the population with or at-risk for AUD and to treat them far more effectively. Morgan Stanley is </span><a href="https://recursiveadaptation.com/p/growing-concerns-that-ozempic-will" rel="">already predicting</a><span> that GLP-1s will cause a drop in sales for alcohol businesses.</span></p><p>From the data in this study, our team created these charts.</p><p><span>Patients treated with semaglutide (Ozempic / Wegovy) showed a 50% or greater reduction in the likelihood of both new alcohol use disorder (AUD) compared to patients treated with non GLP-1 anti-obesity or diabetes medications. For patients with a history of alcohol use disorder, the reduction in likelihood of a subsequent diagnosis was 56%, implying potential protective effects against relapse. These are dramatic reductions, even greater than the 41% drop that the same research group </span><a href="https://recursiveadaptation.com/i/144593909/human-studies-on-glp-and-addiction" rel="">reported for semaglutide and cannabis use disorder</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The second chart shows the study’s findings when comparing semaglutide to naltrexone or topiramate for obesity.

These results are also consistent with </span><a href="https://recursiveadaptation.com/i/144593909/human-studies-on-glp-and-addiction" rel="">previous trials</a><span> of GLP-1s and alcohol.  </span><a href="https://recursiveadaptation.com/i/144593909/appendix-glp-and-addiction-human-trials-in-progress" rel="">At least seven more trials on GLP-1s and alcohol are currently underway</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Addressing excess alcohol use at scale would also have tremendous positive effects for society as a whole, including reductions in crime.
