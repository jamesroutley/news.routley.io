    <h1>Arizona resident dies from the plague less than 24 hours after showing symptoms</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><p>A person has died from the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/plague">plague</a> in Northern <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/arizona">Arizona</a>, health officials confirmed Thursday.</p><p>The victim was rushed to Flagstaff Medical Center, showing severe symptoms, and died the same day. An autopsy revealed Yersinia pestis, the bacterium responsible for plague, was found. No further details about the patient or their identity have been revealed. </p><p>This case comes amid a recent prairie dog die-off northeast of Flagstaff, a classic red flag for plague activity since these rodents often carry infected fleas. </p><p>Coconino County officials are investigating an unknown number of prairie dog deaths linked to plague. They are working with a property owner to collect fleas for testing.</p><p>The plague remains rare in modern America, with the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cdc">Centers for Disease Control</a> reporting an average of seven human cases annually, the majority of which occur in rural areas of the Western U.S., including northern Arizona and parts of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/new-mexico">New Mexico</a> and Colorado.</p><div><figure><div data-gallery-length="2"><p><img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/11/14/26/Untitled-design-(8).jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/11/14/26/Untitled-design-(8).jpg?quality=75&amp;width=320&amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/11/14/26/Untitled-design-(8).jpg?quality=75&amp;width=640&amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Tests confirmed the Arizona patient had Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague."/></p></div><figcaption>Tests confirmed the Arizona patient had Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague.<span> <!-- -->(<!-- -->CDC<!-- -->)</span></figcaption></figure></div><p>Plague occurs in three forms, bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic, depending on whether the infection hits the lymph nodes, bloodstream or lungs.
