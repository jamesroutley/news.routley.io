<p>Imagine the internet like a huge neighborhood. There&#39;s a lot of folks around, but we rarely bump into each other, right? Kagi&#39;s all about
humanizing the web and we want to help surface the people behind the posts and stories that zip
by. This less known corner of the web is also known as the &#34;small web&#34;. Read
more in our <a href="https://blog.kagi.com/small-web">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>We want to amplify the voices of genuine humans on the web - see <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb#small-web">our sources</a>
or check if your blog is in the <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb/blob/main/smallweb.txt">list</a>. You&#39;ll also
encounter these pages now in <a href="https://kagi.com">Kagi search</a> when you&#39;re looking for something relevant.</p>
<p>Hit &#39;Next Post&#39; to read something new. We only show posts from the last
seven days to keep it fresh. Feel like saying thanks or jotting down a thought? Use &#39;Appreciation&#39; and &#39;Notes&#39;. They&#39;ll be around for about a week, but hey, it&#39;s a way to say &#34;hi&#34; to someone else out here.
</p>

And yep, this whole thing is <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/smallweb">open-source</a>. Oh, and no JavaScript on our
end.</p>

<p>So, what do you say? Ready to meet some neighbors?
