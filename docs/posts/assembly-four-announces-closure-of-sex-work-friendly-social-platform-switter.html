    <h1>Assembly Four announces closure of sex-work-friendly social platform Switter</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Dear Internet,</p><blockquote>If big tech with millions of dollars in funding and access to the best talent are confused by these regulations, how do we or any small business stand a chance?<strong><em>‍</em></strong><br/></blockquote><p><strong><em>‍</em></strong>At the end of the day, the national legal system is an imperialist invention that upholds white supremacist ideals designed to oppress and disenfranchise marginalised communities.</p><h2>The Issues in Question</h2><p><strong>‍</strong>The Online Safety Act was passed prior to a review of the Privacy Act being conducted. Any changes to the Privacy Act will change the legal interpretation of the Online Safety Act. This unfairly increases the burden of maintaining compliance with the Act which is inherently vague. <br/></p><blockquote>Even the eSafety commissioner has described the Act as a ‘sausage which is still being made’, which has us wondering - what else is in the sausage?<br/></blockquote><p><em>‍</em>The Act relies on <a href="https://junkee.com/online-safety-bill-queer-people/297980">outdated standards which were developed before homosexuality was fully decriminalised in Austraila</a>, and we still see the <a href="https://www.flicks.com.au/features/donkey-sex-ok-but-gay-sex-is-not-why-australias-film-classification-board-is-homophobic/">chilling effects of the code</a> today.</p><h3>The End of Anonymity</h3><p><strong>‍</strong><a href="https://www.infrastructure.gov.au/sites/default/files/submissions/osb-twitter.pdf">Twitter’s submission</a> to the Online Safety Bill exposure draft consultation highlighted the importance of anonymous and pseudonymous speech. This is fundamental to the development and sustainability of democratic societies, and must be protected in order for citizens to speak truth to power.</p><h3>Chilling Effects</h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Human rights activists are feeling the chilling effects of politicians who are weaponising existing defamation legislation against politically active citizens, such as <a href="https://chuffed.org/project/enough-peter-dutton">Shane Bazzi</a> who lost a case initiated by the current Australian Defence Minister, former Minister for Home Affairs and is currently appealing the decision.</p><h3>The War on Encryption</h3><p><strong>‍</strong>Over the last decade, we have seen a number of attacks on Encryption through private campaigns like No Place to Hide in the UK and through government attempts at legislation like <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/01/us-senate-should-reject-earn-it-act">EARN IT in the US</a> and the <a href="https://digitalrightswatch.org.au/2021/09/02/australias-new-mass-surveillance-mandate/">Identify and Disrupt Bill in Australia</a>.</p><h2>Assembly Four isn&#39;t going anywhere</h2><p><strong>‍</strong>In an ideal world, Switter would never have needed to exist. Assembly Four longs for the day where Sex Workers are treated as equal citizens; offline and online.</p><h4>Digital Rights and Human Rights are one and the same, not separate rights to be won.</h4><p><strong>‍</strong>We are Sex Workers and allies ourselves, so we understand the fear and uncertainty of operating under these legislative frameworks. We have put our own lives, and the lives of our friends and family, at risk by running these platforms and fighting against proposed legislative changes.</p><h4>Switter Users</h4><p>Thank you for your support over the years, it has meant the world. Please find our <a href="http://assemblyfour.com/switter-statement-to-users" target="_blank">user statement</a> which has links to resources on migrating away from Switter. <strong></strong></p><h4>Who is Assembly Four?</h4><p>Assembly Four is a collective of sex workers and technologists founded in 2017, based out of Naarm, Australia. Assembly Four actively engages in policy, research, and development with a focus on the chilling effects that come from vague and rushed legislation aimed at regulating technology, much of which is surveillance and censorship in a trenchcoat.</p></div></div></div></div>
