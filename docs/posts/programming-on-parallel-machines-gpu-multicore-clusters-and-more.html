<strong>OVERVIEW:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<strong>
&#34;Why is this book different from all other parallel programming books?&#34;
</strong>
</p>

<ul>

  <li> Suitable for either students or professionals.  
  </li>  

  <li> Practical viewpoint:  
  

     <ul>

     <li> There is very little theoretical analysis of parallel
     algorithms, such as O() analysis, maximum theoretical speedup,
     acyclic graphs and so on. </li>  

     <li> Extensive coverage of &#34;wizardry&#34; aspects, i.e. material known
     to experienced practitioners but generally not in books, such as
     coverage of loop iteration scheduling, memory effects of storing
     large arrays and so on.  </li> 

     <li> Appendices cover systems background, crucial in applied work
     but always just &#34;assumed&#34; to be knowledge possessed by the readers.
     </li>  

     <li> Considerable attention is paid to techniques for debugging.
     </li>  

     </ul>
  
  </li><li> Uses the main parallel platforms---OpenMP, CUDA and
  MPI---rather than languages that at this stage are largely
  experimental, such as the elegant-but-not-yet-mainstream Cilk.
  </li>  

  <li> Starts with real parallel code right away in Chapter 1, with
  examples from pthreads, OpenMP and MPI.
  </li>  

</ul>

<p>
<strong>
Constantly evolving:
</strong>
Like all my open source textbooks, this one is constantly
evolving.  I continue to add new topics, new examples, more timing
analyses, and so on, and of course fix bugs and improve the exposition.
</p>

<p> <i>Prerequisites</i>:  The student must be easonably adept in
programming, and have math background through linear algebra.  (An
appendix to the book reviews the parts of the latter needed for this
book.) </p>
