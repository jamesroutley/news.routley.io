    <h1>Ask HN: How do you deal with information and internet addiction?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have noticed that I am getting more and more addicted to consuming information so I am listening to podcasts while working and I watch Youtube videos in my free time. This is all fun and interesting but I feel this makes me want to do things less and less. Instead of working on my own problems I distract myself by listening to ever more information. I get a lot of benefit from this information but somehow it feels shallow.</p><p>I think part of it is that my work is quite uninteresting and doesn&#39;t really keep my mind engaged. But the work is tedious enough that I am too tried in the evening to do something interesting. After a few years everything feels like it&#39;s a repeat.</p><p>Does anybody else feel that way? Have you been able to detach yourself from the constant flow of information and focus on your own stuff?</p></div></div></div>
