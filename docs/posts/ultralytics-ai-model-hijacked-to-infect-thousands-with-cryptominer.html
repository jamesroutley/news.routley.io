<p>The popular Ultralytics YOLO11 AI model was compromised in a supply chain attack to deploy cryptominers on devices running versions 8.3.41 and 8.3.42 from the Python Package Index (PyPI)  </p>

<p>Ultralytics is a software development company specializing in computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in object detection and image processing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s best known for its &#34;YOLO&#34; (You Only Look Once) advanced object detection model, which can quickly and accurately detect and identify objects in video streams in real time.</p>

<p>Ultralytics tools are <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">open-source</a> and are used by numerous projects spanning a wide range of industries and applications.</p>

<p>The library has been starred 33,600 times and forked 6,500 times on GitHub, and it has had <a href="https://pypistats.org/packages/ultralytics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">over 260,000 downloads</a> over the past 24 hours from PyPI alone.</p>

<h2>Ultralytics YOLO11 compromised</h2>

<p>Yesterday, Ultralytics 8.3.41 and 8.3.42 were released to PyPi, and users who installed the compromised versions directly or as a dependency discovered that a cryptominer was deployed. For Google Colab accounts, owners got flagged and banned due to &#34;abusive activity.&#34;</p>

<p>Ultralytics is a dependency of both SwarmUI and <a href="https://blog.comfy.org/comfyui-statement-on-the-ultralytics-crypto-miner-situation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">ComfyUI</a>, who both confirmed that fresh installs of their libraries would have led to the installation of the miner.</p>



<p>When installed, the compromised library installs and launches an XMRig Miner at &#39;<code>/tmp/ultralytics_runner</code>&#39; to connect to a minin pool at &#34;connect.consrensys[.]com:8080&#34;.</p>

<p>Ultralytics founder and CEO Glenn Jocher confirmed that the issue only impacts those two compromised versions, which have already been pulled and replaced with a clean 8.3.43 version.</p>

<p>&#34;We confirm that Ultralytics versions 8.3.41 and 8.3.42 were compromised by a malicious code injection targeting cryptocurrency mining. Both versions have been immediately removed from PyPI,&#34; <a href="http://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues/18030#issuecomment-2521580233" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Jocher posted to GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>&#34;We have released 8.3.43 which addresses this security issue. Our team is conducting a full security audit and implementing additional safeguards to prevent similar incidents.&#34;</p>

<p>​</p>

<p>However, Jocher commented that the compromise appears to originate from two malicious PRs [<a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/pull/18018" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/pull/18020" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">2</a>]with code injection in the branch names submitted by a user in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Whether the malicious code solely performed crypto mining or compromised private user data remains unclear, and the community is still awaiting a formal advisory regarding the breach that will provide clarifications on all details.</p>

<p>Out of an abundance of caution, those who downloaded a malicious version of Ultralytics should perform a full system scan.</p>

<p>BleepingComputer has contacted Ultralytics to comment on the situation and learn more about how the supply chain compromise was achieved, but we are still awaiting a response.</p>
