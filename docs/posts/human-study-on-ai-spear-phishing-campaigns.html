    <h1>Human study on AI spear phishing campaigns</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div id="postContent"><div><div><p id="block0">TL;DR: We ran a human subject study on whether language models can successfully spear-phish people. We use AI agents built from GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet to search the web for available information on a target and use this for highly personalized phishing messages. We achieved a click-through rate of above 50% for our AI-generated phishing emails.</p><h2 id="Full_paper__https___arxiv_org_abs_2412_00586">Full paper: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00586">https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00586</a></h2><p id="block1">This post is intended to be a brief summary of the main findings, these are some key insights we gained:</p><ol><li id="block2">AI spear-phishing is highly effective, receiving a click-through rate of more than 50%, significantly outperforming our control group.</li><li id="block3">AI-spear phishing is also highly cost-efficient, reducing costs by up to 50 times compared to manual attacks.</li><li id="block4">AI models are highly capable of gathering open-source intelligence. They produce accurate and useful profiles for 88% of targets. Only 4% of the generated profiles contained inaccurate information.</li><li id="block5">Safety guardrails are not a noteworthy barrier for creating phishing mails with any tested model, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o1-preview.</li><li id="block6">Claude 3.5 Sonnet is surprisingly good at detecting AI-generated phishing emails, though it struggles with some phishing emails that are clearly suspicious to most humans.</li></ol><p id="block7">In this paper, we evaluate the capability of large language models to conduct personalized phishing attacks and compare their performance with human experts and AI models from last year. We include four email groups with a combined total of 101 participants: A control group of arbitrary phishing emails, which received a click-through rate (recipient pressed a link in the email) of 12%, emails generated by human experts (54% click-through), fully AI-automated emails 54% (click-through), and AI emails utilizing a human-in-the-loop (56% click-through). Thus, the AI-automated attacks performed on par with human experts and 350% better than the control group. The results are a significant improvement from similar studies conducted last year, highlighting the increased deceptive capabilities of AI models. Our AI-automated emails were sent using a custom-built tool that automates the entire spear phishing process, including information gathering and creating personalized vulnerability profiles for each target. The AI-gathered information was accurate and useful in 88% of cases and only produced inaccurate profiles for 4% of the participants. We also use language models to detect the intention of emails. Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored well above 90% with low false-positive rates and detected several seemingly benign emails that passed human detection. Lastly, we analyze the economics of phishing, highlighting how AI enables attackers to target more individuals at lower cost and increase profitability by up to 50 times for larger audiences.</p><p id="block8">In a brief summary, the method consists of 5 steps:</p><ol><li id="block9">Collecting Targets.</li><li id="block10">Collecting information about the targets using an AI web-browsing agent that crawls publicly available information.</li><li id="block11">Writing personalized phishing emails based on the collected information and carefully crafted language model prompts.</li><li id="block12">Sending emails using custom-built and automated software.</li><li id="block13">Analyzing outcomes by tracking clicks on embedded URLs in emails.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/zihrxmduql07fedjthpg" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/ikadfgqrctfkr4odt4zs 340w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/mj70icvkqleshm2gkrjh 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/chqjwjz8z46bbjabcfip 1020w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/qqxaaxn7dt2tazrnsmvg 1360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/r0azmgnf9kw4bxgqz27w 1700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/muertujy7chjqeyojaxw 2040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/h4ess8sexvyuodbowyno 2380w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/hwcrsogy7gjv5aisifif 2720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/xtso6rsibpx4g0ccybdj 3060w, https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GCHyDKfPXa5qsG2cP/rln5x6elatjmjojxorrf 3372w"/><figcaption>Example from the paper for an AI-compiled profile from step 2 and an AI-written email from step 3.</figcaption></figure><p id="block14">For full results, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00586">go to the paper</a></p><p id="block15">The results of the phishing emails are presented in the figure below (figure 5 in the paper).

Detailed persuasion results for different models would help us understand how AI-based deception is evolving and how to ensure our protection schemes stay up-to-date. Additionally, we will explore fine-tuning models for creating and detecting phishing. We are also interested in evaluating AI&#39;s capabilities to exploit other communication channels, such as social media or modalities like voice. Lastly, we want to measure what happens after users press a link in an email. For example, how likely is it that a pressed email link results in successful exploitation, what different attack trees exist (such as downloading files or entering account details in phishing sites), and how well can AI exploit and defend against these different paths? We also encourage other researchers to explore these avenues.Â </p><p id="block24">We propose personalized mitigation strategies to counter AI-enhanced phishing. The cost-effective nature of AI makes it highly plausible we&#39;re moving towards an agent vs agent future. AI could assist users by creating personalized vulnerability profiles, combining their digital footprint with known behavioral patterns.</p><p id="block25">Our results reveal the significant challenges that personalized, AI-generated phishing emails present to current cybersecurity systems. Many existing spam filters use signature detection (detecting known malicious content and behaviors). By using language models, attackers can effortlessly create phishing emails that are uniquely adapted to every target, rendering signature detection schemes obsolete. As models advance, their capabilities of persuasion will likely also increase. We find that LLM-driven spear phishing is highly effective and economically viable, with automated reconnaissance that provides accurate and useful information in almost all cases. Current safety guardrails fail to reliably prevent models from conducting reconnaissance or generating phishing emails. However, AI could mitigate these threats through advanced detection and tailored countermeasures.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
