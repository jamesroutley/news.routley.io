        <p data-block-key="imase">Every day, people come to YouTube to learn something new. Whether it’s getting help on class assignments, studying a foreign language or exploring a different career, people are using YouTube to enrich their lives with new information. As a fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw">3blue1brown</a> myself, I use YouTube to learn about math topics my children are interested in. A<a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/progress-impact/impact/report/"> recent study</a> found that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/progress-impact/impact/report/">93% of viewers</a> report using YouTube to gather information, so we’re announcing updates to make educational content even more accessible and interactive for learners while helping learning creators thrive on YouTube.</p>

        <div><p data-block-key="imase">Finally, to help learners apply what they’ve learned, we’re introducing Quizzes — a new way for creators to help viewers test their knowledge. For example, a math creator who recently posted a series on algebra can create a Quiz on the Community tab to ask their viewers a question related to a concept taught in their latest video. Quizzes will roll out in beta over the coming months, with all creators who have the Community tab gaining access to Quizzes next year.</p><p data-block-key="2f8od">Learning remains a top priority for YouTube. Just this year, we introduced an option for creators to add metadata that allows them to target their content to specific grade levels and topics. We’ve also added a <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/helping-ukrainian-teachers/">Ukrainian version</a> of the Learning destination to help ensure that Ukranians have access to important educational content, even as the war continues. Our goal is to keep making learning easier on the platform for everyone in the community, whether that be creators, students in classrooms, or learners around the world. Whatever you want to learn next, we want YouTube to be there for you.</p></div>
