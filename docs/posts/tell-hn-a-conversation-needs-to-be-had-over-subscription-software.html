For example, it makes sense for me, with a broken App Store search, to pay $4 for each download when I can get users to pay $5/month to use my app.</p><p>- Many other examples, with the whole industry going towards SaaS and HaaS</p><p>What has the world come to, where technology has been appropriated and we are left paying rents every month and companies are increasingly becoming user-hostile and predatory and monopolistic!</p></td></tr>
