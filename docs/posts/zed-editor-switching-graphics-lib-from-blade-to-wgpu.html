    <h1>Zed editor switching graphics lib from blade to wgpu</h1>

          <blockquote>
<p dir="auto">it works worse for vram and perfomance</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">have you read the thread above? This statement is simply not true when comparing to blade. The implementation already has a lower VRAM and memory footprint than the blade implementation had, and that is before some performance improvements addressing the comments above. Performance will not change with this PR significantly either, the wgpu implementation does essentially the same thing as the blade implementation did. Feel free to run benchmarks on this...</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">slow compilation and twice rust-analyzer ram usage at dev time</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Have you tried compiling the zed repo? Wgpu build times are not the issue or bottleneck here. On my system the difference was barely noticable, and since we have incremental builds for dependencies most of it will be one-time only anyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">sometimes it has long-time problems without fixes</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Sure, wgpu has issues too. The difference is that it is actively maintained and a core dependency of many big projects. There is generally a big interest in getting significant things fixed. Blade on the other hand has open PRs (not even just issues) with small fixes that have a big impact (breaking issues) for downstream apps that haven&#39;t been merged in half a year. I don&#39;t want to attack the author, I know maintaining OSS is a lot of work and usually doesn&#39;t pay the bills, but zed and gpui are projects people rely on, so I don&#39;t think this is acceptable for a core dependency.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">You personally like wgpu, i personally dislike it especially after development and usage of apps based on it</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I could also turn that argument around, but more importantly I think community support and stability are plainly more important that slight differences in API ergonomics.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">looks like something that can be made selectable by cfg flags based on checking this pr</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Yes of course it could, but that has certain implications that should be considered. If you add it  as a new backend, it will also have to be maintained, so more work for further improvements. This is already a bit of an issue with GPUI given the different renderer implementation. I respect the decision of the zed maintainers to support those implementation, but personally I think we should thrive to consolidate the rendering infrastructure, not further fragment it. There are exciting things for the future that could be enabled (or significantly simplified for end-users) by consolidation, like APIs for custom shaders, direct buffer access for custom elements, embedding into other wgpu apps (or being embeddable by them), like bevy.</p>
