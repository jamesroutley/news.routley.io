<p><strong>Series 3 Adds a New Class of Intel Core Ultra X9 and X7 Processors</strong></p><p>Within the Intel Core Ultra Series 3 mobile lineup, a new class of Intel Core Ultra X9 and X7 processors come packed with the highest performing, integrated Intel® Arc<sup>™</sup> graphics. They are purpose-built for multitaskers that handle advanced workloads like gaming, creation and productivity on the go. The top SKUs feature up to 16 CPU cores, 12 X<sup>e</sup> -cores and 50 NPU TOPS, delivering up to 60% better multithread performance<sup>1</sup> over 77% faster gaming performance<sup>2</sup> and up to 27 hours of battery life<sup>3</sup>.</p><p>The Series 3 family also includes Intel Core processors, intentionally designed to power mainstream mobile systems. Leveraging the same foundational architecture of Intel Core Ultra Series 3, the Intel Core lineup enables more performant and efficient laptop designs at lower price points.</p><p><strong>Event Press Kit: </strong><a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/press-kit/press-kit-intel-at-ces-2026">Intel at CES 2026</a></p><div id="wpcpro-wrapper-7780"><p><img decoding="async" src="https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-carousel-pro/src/Frontend/css/spinner.svg" alt="Preloader image"/></p></div>
<p><strong>Series 3 Accelerates AI Adoption in Robotics, Smart Cities, Automation and Healthcare </strong></p><p>For the first time, alongside their PC counterparts, Series 3 edge processors are certified for embedded and industrial use cases, including extended temperature ranges, deterministic performance, and 24x7 reliability.</p><p>Intel Core Ultra Series 3 delivers competitive advantages in critical edge AI workloads with up to 1.9x higher large language model (LLM) performance<sup>4</sup>, up to 2.3x better performance per watt per dollar on end-to-end video analytics<sup>5</sup>, and up to 4.5x higher throughput on vision language action (VLA) models<sup>6</sup>. The integrated AI acceleration enables superior total cost of ownership (TCO) through a single system on chip (SoC) solution versus traditional multi-chip CPU and GPU architectures.</p><p><strong>Availability</strong></p><p>Pre-orders for the first consumer laptops powered by Intel Core Ultra Series 3 processors will begin Jan. 6, 2026. Systems will be available globally starting Jan. 27, 2026, with additional designs coming throughout the first half of the year.</p><p>Edge systems powered by Intel Core Ultra Series 3 will be available starting Q2 2026.</p><p><strong>More: </strong><a href="https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2026/CES2026/CES2026-presskit-supporting-quotes.pdf">Supporting Quotes from Partners</a> | <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/871378/content-details.html">Product Brief: Intel Core Ultra Series 3 Processors</a> | <a href="https://download.intel.com/newsroom/2026/CES2026/Intel-CES2026-Core-Ultra-Series-3-Press-Deck.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Press Deck: Supplemental Data Deep Dive</a></p><div>
