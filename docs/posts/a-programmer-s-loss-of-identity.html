        <p>This is the follow-up to last year’s
<a href="https://ratfactor.com/tech-nope">I’m an American software developer and the &#34;broligarchs&#34; don’t speak for me</a>.
In that essay, I tried to express why I was so agonized by the leaders in my
industry doing a speedrun towards dystopia and how it all felt so divorced from
what technology could, and <em>should</em> be. Everything I wrote there is still
true, but amplified.</p>
<p>As an aside, I received a lot of positive feedback on that essay, thank you!
(And I’m sorry that I still haven’t responded to some of you. My inbox is a
disaster for a variety of reasons.) The wild thing is that I received <em>zero</em>
negative feedback. My pet theory is that it was simply too long and nuanced for
casual drive-by critics and that anyone who stuck with it did so because they
found something that resonated. What you’re reading now is much shorter and I
guess I’ll be testing that theory, for better or worse.</p>
<div>

<div>
<p>I was listening to a
<a href="https://www.404media.co/the-404-media-podcast/">404 Media Podcast</a> (404media.co)
interview with Samuel Bagg about his article
<a href="https://blog.apaonline.org/2025/11/12/the-problem-is-epistemic-the-solution-is-not/">The Problem is Epistemic. The Solution is Not.</a> (apaonline.org).
It’s a fascinating and unsettling claim that the way we process information and
truth is through our social identities. Bagg explains the research behind this
clearly and convincingly in the podcast.</p>
<p>About halfway through the episode, I starting thinking about my own social
identities.  And that’s when a realization hit me quite hard: I’ve
lost one of mine and I’ve been subconsciously mourning it.</p>
<p>That lost identity was <strong>&#34;computer programmer&#34;</strong> and it was arguably one of my biggest.</p>
<p>It’s weird to say I’ve lost it when I’m still every bit the computer programmer
(in both the professional and hobby sense) I ever was.  My love for computers
and programming them hasn’t diminished at all.  But a <em>social</em> identity isn’t
about typing on a keyboard, It’s about belonging to a group, a community, a
culture.</p>
<p>What was my group? Well, let’s use me as an example.</p>
<p>I enjoy programming computers because they function on a set of precise and
rigid rules.  This creates a kind of fantasy world where you can gain
wizard-like powers as you accumulate knowledge. Yes, programming is hard and it
can be exasperating, but that makes the eventual accomplishment of mastering
the skill all the sweeter. Over time, you gain fluency and dexterity as a programmer.
It feels good.</p>
<p>Which is to say that the pleasure I get from programming is mostly about
<strong>learning</strong> the underlying truths about computation and <strong>applying</strong> what I’ve
learned. Always improving the craft. This, to me, is the practice of programming.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, the more you learn, the more you realize how much there is
still to learn.  I’ve spent countless hours over the last 30 years reading
about, thinking about, and practicing the art, hobby, occupation, and
discipline of programming computers.  If only by volume, it’s a big part of who
I am.</p>
<p>Socially, the &#34;computer programmer&#34; identity has steered my life in small and
large ways from the websites and forums I visited to the friends I’ve made,
where I work and live. It’s one of those things you don’t usually even examine
because its so big you can’t even see it until you take a step outside yourself
to get a different vantage point.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_the_loss">The loss</h2>
<div>
<p>The transformation has been bewildering. It feels like the blink of an
eye, though I guess it’s been about three years. The culture has changed
immensely in that short time. When I identified with the programmer culture, it
was about <em>programming</em>. Now programming is a means to an end (&#34;let’s see how
fast we can build a surveillance state!&#34;) or simply an unwanted chore to be
avoided.</p>
<p>One by one, I’ve stopped visiting the usual websites and forums. I kept reading
them longer than I should have. I was in denial.  I thought it would blow over
like NFTs or &#34;Web3&#34;. I still thought I was among my people and my culture.</p>
<p>I guess as I get older, I’m better able to see where my part has been on the
computing timeline.  And it’s pretty clear that I was very lucky, riding a wave
of personal computing on an upward slope that probably started sometime during
the radical advent of home computers in the 1980s and continued well into the
2010s. It’s depressing to think that I lived through a peak and that I should
be doomed to watch the trend slide downward as fast as possible back into
centralized corporate control. You people…​want this?
I was so
naïve
that I thought progress could only go one direction, because that’s all I’d
ever known.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_why_i_know_i_dont_belong_anymore">Why I know I don’t belong anymore</h2>
<div>
<p>The social group I still identify with shares my values. We value learning.  We
value  the merits of language design, type systems, software maintenance,
levels of abstraction, and yeah, if I’m honest, minute syntactical differences,
the color of the bike shed, and the best way to get that perfectly smooth shave
on a yak.  I’m not sure what we’re called now, &#34;heirloom programmers&#34;?</p>
<p>Do I sound like a machine code programmer in the 1950s refusing to learn
structured programming and compiled languages? I reject that comparison. I love
a beautiful abstraction just as much as I love a good low-level trick.</p>
<p>If the problem is that we’ve painted our development environments into a corner
that requires tons of boilerplate, then <em>that</em> is the problem. We
should have been chopping the cruft away and replacing it with deterministic
abstractions like we’ve always done. That’s what that Larry Wall quote about
good programmers being lazy was about.  It did <em>not</em> mean that we would be okay
with pulling a damn slot machine lever a couple times to generate the
boilerplate.</p>
<p>Clearly this is not an opinion shared by the vocal body of &#34;computer
programmers&#34; today. Will that ever change? Maybe. I don’t know. But I have the
sense to know that I can’t make it change by wanting it bad enough, nor am I
going to contort my beliefs to fit in.</p>
<p>I’ll say the <em>really</em> awful part now: For the first time in my life, I’m
suddenly wary of meeting other &#34;computer programmers&#34; in the wild. I feel like
there’s a decent chance we won’t actually have much in common, let alone values
or morality.</p>
<p>(I’m even more wary of &#34;technology enthusiasts&#34;. There’s plenty of technology
I’m enthusiastic about, but I need to make sure we’re talking about the same
things.)</p>
<p>My purpose here isn’t to scold anybody per se. Well, almost.  To those who have
chosen to use <strong>fear</strong> and <strong>intimidation</strong> to help sell the agenda of the big tech
CEOs who, in turn, have somehow managed to use coal-fired GPUs to capture
society’s output and sell it back to us, while converting a significant portion
of the economy into an expanding envelope of hot gas: I not only scold you, I
shun you. I have turned my back to you. That goes double if I once admired and
respected you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_so_then_who_am_i">So then, who am I?</h2>
<div>
<p>Luckily, we all have multiple social identities. Me? Oh, I am quite
three-dimensional, thank you.  I have found myself naturally leaning more
heavily into my other interests as social and creative outlets. I
have always loved art and books and music.  Those are big groups and they alone
are more than enough, though I have others too.</p>
<p>I’m going to keep writing technical articles and computer programs for my
fellow humans.  Sometimes it feels pointless to just keep making stuff and
releasing it knowing the <em>takers</em> are out there vacuuming it all up (and
hammering my server nonstop like a zombie horde).  But then I think about the
next generation who will be coming along and bringing with them, against all
odds, a love for learning and creating.  Because that is a human thing.  I try
to imagine a beginner somehow coming across one of my pages and maybe the way I
worded the explanation is what finally makes the topic make sense. That’s good
motivation.</p>
<p>Anyway, you would have to kill me to stop me from making things. Sharing them
is just part of the pleasure.</p>
<p>And finally, yes, with kindred souls, I still love to talk about programming
computers.</p>
