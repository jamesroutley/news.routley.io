Those insiders include venture capital firms like a16z and, incredibly, Coinbase’s <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/ventures" rel="">own venture arm</a>, which has a number of investments listed on Coinbase. Other exchanges like Kraken, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/05/ftx-lightspeed-solana-ventures-to-invest-100m-in-web3-gaming/" rel="">FTX</a>, and <a href="https://www.gemini.com/frontier-fund" rel="">Gemini</a> are also all active in venture, and have listed their own investments.</p><p>Why is this important and not just nerdonomics? First, Coinbase is like the New York Stock Exchange of crypto - a listing there is a huge deal, and usually leads to massive profits for everyone involved. But unlike the NYSE or NASDAQ, Coinbase gets to choose whatever assets they want, using their own <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/a-guide-to-listings-assets-on-coinbase-2556fee4efa6" rel="">process</a>.</p><p>Second, a16z and Coinbase’s own returns are particularly interesting, given a16z is supposedly the best investor in this space, and there’s a potential for conflict of interest. Is the game rigged?</p><p>Third, Coinbase pivoted its strategy last year to go from being cautious to listing as <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/13/coinbase-to-speed-up-process-for-approving-new-coins-add-doge-ceo/" rel="">many coins as they can</a>. That raises the ante even higher for them and their users.</p><p>So I started to dig in, and what I found surprised me: most coins underperformed, returns got worse over time, and VC-backed coins did worst of all.</p><p>But I was able to do one better - for the last few years, Coinbase put out the names of coins they were <em>thinking</em> to list, but never did. I analyzed those coins - and found they did even better than the ones that made it, and the VC-backed ones didn’t show any of the same underperformance. </p><p>Let’s dig in. </p><p><strong>Coinbase Effect or Coinbase Curse?</strong></p><p>For years, being listed for trading on Coinbase has been the holy grail of crypto - the equivalent of an IPO on Wall Street. And like an IPO, that seems to come up with a “pop” - Messari, a crypto research firm, documented in a report that the <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/07/coinbase-effect-means-average-91-token-price-gain-in-5-days-messari-says/" rel="">average Coinbase listing leads to a 91% gain</a> in 5 days, on average.</p><p>But I think there are two flaws with that analysis:</p><ol><li><p>This is an extremely short time frame. If you believe, as I do, that the returns for most coins come from illiquidity rather than fundamental value, the sudden rush of buyers after a listing will create a pop but eventually turn negative as insiders’ lockups end.</p><p>What do I mean by illiquidity? Basically, many have a large amount of the supply immobilized, or <a href="https://defipulse.com/" rel="">“locked” in Defi</a> protocols, with incentives not to sell. Project developers and investors will hold a significant amount of the coins, but over time, the supply gets released.</p></li><li><p>Showing returns on an absolute basis is meaningless. If you’re a hedge fund, you have to beat the benchmark. The benchmark for any cryptocurrency should be Bitcoin (BTC) and/or Ethereum (ETH). In my opinion, Ethereum makes sense as the majority of these “web3” tokens are built on Ethereum’s vision, rather than Bitcoin’s.</p><p>For example, the Coindesk article above cites a “six fold” return on Filecoin. But investors who chose to buy Filecoin instead of Bitcoin at Coinbase’s listing on December 10th actually did poorly on relative terms, with a rapid decline (yellow line) in the first month. </p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fc4daf6-57df-4bb0-b43c-aeb2a6301cb4_987x618.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_5760,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5fc4daf6-57df-4bb0-b43c-aeb2a6301cb4_987x618.png" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5fc4daf6-57df-4bb0-b43c-aeb2a6301cb4_987x618.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:true,&#34;height&#34;:618,&#34;width&#34;:987,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><p><em>Note: The yellow line is performance against Bitcoin, and green in USD terms.</em></p><p>Most of that return they cited was Bitcoin going up, and Filecoin has actually severely underperformed Bitcoin in the time since - by 55%!</p><p>I’m not alone in this. Most people who have experience trading crypto look at the prices in BTC or ETH, not in USD, to make assessments.</p><p>How do Coinbase’s listings stack up? I took 128 listings from Coinbase (removing stablecoins and pegged coins) and separated listings by year. </p><p><em>Note: For the most part, I used the official announcement date by Coinbase for Coinbase Pro. Trading for most coins usually began within 2 days and often on the same day.</em></p><p>The results largely confirm my thesis in my view. Coinbase and VCs will likely trumpet the USD returns as proof that crypto allows retail investors (the “community”) to partake in the growth of these networks. But the reality shows that most of the return comes very early after the listing - the 2021 coins are doing great, but everything from 2020 and earlier is underperforming! The 2021 return is also below the 91% pop cited by Messari, which suggests after the pop they all lose value.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fcc7934-c1f6-4e25-93ae-e7ce81884930_548x137.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8fcc7934-c1f6-4e25-93ae-e7ce81884930_548x137.png" width="680" height="170" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8fcc7934-c1f6-4e25-93ae-e7ce81884930_548x137.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:137,&#34;width&#34;:548,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:680,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><p>Once a coin has been on Coinbase for a year, it appears to lag Bitcoin and Ethereum pretty soundly.</p><p>I also looked for coins where I could find the return for the one year (68 of the 128) prior to listing, just to show that the coins were not performing badly since inception:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb35ea37c-2a0d-4aeb-9713-f8f7e550e0bf_404x90.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1100,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb35ea37c-2a0d-4aeb-9713-f8f7e550e0bf_404x90.png" width="614" height="136.78217821782178" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b35ea37c-2a0d-4aeb-9713-f8f7e550e0bf_404x90.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:90,&#34;width&#34;:404,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:614,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><p>If we split up the coins listed in the last year, we still see the same pattern: the coins in the last six months (65 coins) do better than those in the previous six months, and the last six months also lag the average 91% pop.

The never listed coin is the best; the listed, non-VC coin is better; and the listed, VC-backed coin is the worst.</p><p><strong>What Does It All Mean?</strong></p><p>My first thought on viewing this is I myself won’t buy anything listed on Coinbase, especially after the initial pop, and to stop trusting VC-backed coins. Turns out I didn’t lose all my trading skills after all..</p><p>The logical inference would be to only buy BTC and ETH, although those returns have also come down on an annual basis (including the last year), although are still far less risky than these smaller coins. Overall, they seem like a better shot than buying “web3” tokens. (Please re-read the disclaimer at the top.)</p><p>I think it also has important implications for some of the big debates in crypto:</p><ul><li><p><strong>A counterpoint to the “Balaji” thesis. </strong>Balaji likes to <a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1474153599764553728" rel="">repeatedly</a> make the point that a major value proposition for “web3” is to help the “little guy”: letting users participate in value creation (e.g., have some ownership in a project). However, the <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/coinbase-statistics/" rel="">vast majority</a> of users are buying on Coinbase and so are simply underperforming Bitcoin.</p></li><li><p><strong>Support for the “Jack” thesis. </strong>Jack’s contention is that most tokens are owned by VCs, and that they are ruining Bitcoin by using the “web3” narrative to siphon off liquidity created by the demand for deflationary assets. Jack is something of a Bitcoin maxi, so this is self-serving, but so far it looks like he might be onto something.</p></li></ul><p>Other thoughts: Coinbase might also be throwing away its brand here. They might need new assets to encourage trading, but others think the pivot away from the cautious approach may be the influence of Balaji - which makes sense given his thesis about “helping” investors, but he might be wrong looking at the data. Also, Balaji used to work at a16z and Coinbase - so no one can really say his motives!</p><p>Lastly - do I think there’s something nefarious going on at either company? I actually don’t think so - it’s possible they haven’t even looked at the numbers themselves. They might just be the most transparent, since it’s hard to get data on other investors and exchanges. But they also have the most influence by far. And as Uncle Ben said, with great power…</p><p>Rather, I think this is a microcosm of how bad the incentives are in crypto - VCs and private investors that used to have to wait ten years for liquidity can now get it within one. The last time that happened was 1999, and we know how that ended. It’s a recipe for risk taking that is then quickly passed on to the public.</p><p><strong>Addressing Likely Objections To My Analysis</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>You’re a nocoiner.</strong> Nope, I’m long BTC, ETH, and NEAR, with March ‘22 $26 puts on BITO to hedge some of the recent volatility.</p></li><li><p><strong>You’re a Bitcoin maxi. </strong>Nope, I worked for Joe Lubin and ConsenSys <a href="https://medium.com/@faisal.khan_32964" rel="">for three years</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>You didn’t look at other exchanges. </strong>Given Coinbase had the largest “pop” by far on exchange listings, I would imagine the liquidity fade would be the strongest there too. I also think the a16z-Coinbase nexus is the best one to study, because a16z and Coinbase are tied at the hip and have the most influence. I also doubt a16z has accounts at Kraken or Gemini, given their vested interest in Coinbase, so I wouldn’t imagine a relationship there. I would be interested to do an analysis versus Binance, so that might be a future analysis.</p></li><li><p><strong>These aren’t bad returns. </strong>The returns for coins listed in the last year (basically 2021) are still good, and the USD returns are all positive. That’s fine, but I would say if these coins only went up because Bitcoin did, what’s going to happen when Bitcoin has a bad year? And if you just lose to Bitcoin, what’s the point of Coinbase? </p></li><li><p><strong>You did this during the bloodbath so it looks worse. </strong>Nope - I ran the original numbers in December (BTC around $50k) before I wrote the piece, and all the same trends held.</p></li></ul><p><strong>My Suggested Solutions (Hello, Gary Gensler)</strong></p><p>The first question I would ask is Should This Be Legal? NASDAQ and NYSE have venture funds, but the SEC has to approve their investments before they can be listed publicly! No regulator checks each Coinbase listing. Sure, maybe they have processes and act in good faith, but would you trust any old company’s financial statements if no one was auditing them?</p><p>Think of it this way: it’s like if Google invested in Goldman (Messari in this case), which then published research reports about Google’s work, and then Google ran IPOs of its own investments. And no one has to disclose what they’re buying or selling. Would you get any good information in this clusterfuck of bad incentives?</p><p>Here’s some solutions that I think are necessary to better protect investors and correct some of these bad incentives:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Fund disclosures. </strong>Hedge funds and mutual funds are regulated by 13F and 13D: for 13F, they have to disclose their holdings every quarter, and for 13D, anytime they acquire more than 5% of a public company. My view is that VCs and other crypto investors should have to do the same for crypto. Want to sell to the public? Play by public markets rules. Otherwise, it’s not fair to mom and pops who are clicking on their billionth YouTube ad for Coinbase.</p><p>Some will say 13F and 13D don’t do much and might not help small investors who won’t read filings. But I say it will allow professional investors to evaluate tokens that have taken on investors who liquidate quickly, and that will allow for reputations to be earned/lost.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fix accredited investor rules - but not just by deregulation. </strong>Populists will say “get rid of the accredited investor rules! That’s holding back people’s participation in economic growth!” And I say absolutely. But do you know public companies (you know, “permissionless” investing) also are subject to regulation and disclosure rules? These advocates want the deregulation of VC (necessary) without the rules of public markets (also necessary). That means S-1 style public filings. S-1s typically disclose the relationship between investors and directors, risks, and importantly, ownership by management and major investors. </p><p>I’m sure the Balaji’s and Ryan Selkis’ of the world would say this idea would “kill” innovation: Contrary to popular opinions, I don’t believe companies are staying private longer due to the onerous rules (although they are onerous), but that public markets became more forgiving of losing money, which meant you could go public at bigger and bigger scale of losses. If you could avoid dilution and get a bigger exit, as a founder or investor, why wouldn’t you?</p></li><li><p><strong>Close the utility and governance coin loopholes.</strong> The SEC accidentally created a massive loophole when it said Ethereum was not a security, because Ethereum’s coin has <em>utility</em>. </p><p>Let’s say you’re a deli, and you decide to sell sandwich coupons online (utility!). If people on the Internet seem willing to pay for them, why would you not issue a billion sandwich coupons? Sure, your little deli won’t sell a billion sandwiches in the next ten thousand years, but that’s not your problem. </p><p>Most DeFi coins use a “governance token” model, where one token is one vote. That falls into a very similar “how many votes?” gray area. </p><p>Let’s look at Celo as an example: between <a href="https://www.kraken.com/en-us/learn/what-is-celo" rel="">“2018 and 2020, Celo raised over $46.5 million by selling roughly 120 million CELO tokens.”</a> It has stated since that the total supply of tokens will never exceed 1 billion, with only 6% (60M) of that circulating at launch. Since then, it was listed on Coinbase on September 3rd (Coinbase and a16z invested) with <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1slQ5jzBwPhuneKm1TuwbG4EPdfpYVw62Hs9V6S479iA/edit#gid=70045179" rel="">approximately 12%</a> of the coins in circulation, and in the 15 months since that has increased to 37% today! </p><p>This coin is valuable for its ability to “vote on the creation of stablecoins,” so of course we need a billion of them.</p><p>If utility/governance coins remain an open loophole, the issuing company needs to provide a fair estimate of how many tokens will actually be needed by users in a disclosure - so investors can hold them accountable.</p><p>Look at how the performance flatlined since the release schedule accelerated significantly (to 1.2% per month) in April 2021:</p></li></ol><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0485fd-5d4f-4822-8d92-aed63e3f14e4_859x529.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_5760,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0485fd-5d4f-4822-8d92-aed63e3f14e4_859x529.png" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/8c0485fd-5d4f-4822-8d92-aed63e3f14e4_859x529.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:true,&#34;height&#34;:529,&#34;width&#34;:859,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><ol start="4"><li><p><strong>Stricter (de)listing rules.</strong> Coinbase has no rules currently around minimum market cap, minimum number of shareholders, or minimum trades per day. That means shitcoins can go down, and down, and down. The <a href="https://finance.zacks.com/new-york-stock-exchange-listing-delisting-requirements-7504.html" rel="">NYSE</a> and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/investing/the-dirt-on-delisted-stocks/" rel="">NASDAQ</a> have many such rules, which is why they have the best reputations in the world. These also include rules about how much stock can be controlled by the management team. If crypto exchanges have to repeatedly delist their coins due to lack of liquidity or price drops, that will hurt their reputation - giving them an incentive to require good quality.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>In Urdu, we call a lackey a <em>chamcha, </em>“spoon” - because they feed you what you want. At the end of the day, I’m some guy on Substack - but sadly, I think the state of crypto investing today is that all the “research” you get is from someone’s <em>chamcha. </em></p><p>I don’t know whether Balaji or Jack will be proven right in ten years, but all of this supports what I call the “Charlie Lee” (creator of Litecoin) thesis: there may be huge demand for deflationary assets like Bitcoin, but the biggest problem is anyone can create another, similar cryptocurrency, so it’s not really deflationary at all.</p><p>What will Coinbase’s returns for 2021 coins look like next year? I’m willing to bet the same pattern continues, where coins pop and then fade away to sub-Bitcoin returns. At a minimum, I hope Coinbase users can eventually see that - the same way you could for an ETF or mutual fund. Given Coinbase is giving access to riskier and riskier assets over time, it’s only right.</p><p>At best, the investors and exchanges are people who want to reinvent finance but are underestimating its complexity. As Matt Levine says, a lot of crypto is simply <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-22/crypto-exchanges-can-stop-flash-crashes-if-they-want-will-they" rel="">repeating financial history’s mistakes</a>. At worst, it’s rich guys teaming up with their buddies to exploit a bubble and help them buy <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coinbase-ceo-brian-armstrong-buys-133-million-la-mansion-crypto-2022-1" rel="">$100 million dollar mansions</a>. It’s time these big companies and regulators stepped to make sure the same standards and data are available to everyone. Until then, buyer beware.</p><p><em>Notes:</em></p><ol><li><p>In 8 cases, the unlisted coins were not trading at all before Coinbase’s evaluation.
