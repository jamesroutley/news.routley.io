<p>Context: This post is about a project I&#39;ve been working on for while - codename &#34;Charlie&#34;. I presented the slides below at the Recurse Center for a talk called &#34;Conjuring a Conspiracy Kitty&#34;; explaining why Charlie should exist.</p>

<p>After a particularly long stint of regrettable mistakes in my <del>early</del> entire 20s, I started journaling so I can reflect on my thoughts (for once). I bought a little black notebook, titled it &#34;Lessons Learned the Hard Way&#34;, and drew a stick-figure falling off a cliff on the cover. That was back in 2015, I&#39;m still journaling every day a decade later.</p>
<p>Journaling has helped me avoid making poor decisions, apologize when I inevitably do, and to have an honest check-in every night before bed. The goal is to wake up a bit more self-aware.</p>
<p>Although journaling helps me solve many problems, I now have a few others I didn&#39;t anticipate, so I&#39;m trying to code my way through them.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/flavius/page05.webp" alt="Problems"/></p>
<p>First issue is volume; I&#39;ve got more entries than time or energy needed to reread them. Occasionally I&#39;ll reread the &#34;1 Year Ago&#34; entry that my current journaling app provides, but that&#39;s a single frame; disconnected from all others going forward and back in time. The storyline that captures the who, what, where, is broken and discrete.</p>
<p>I initially tried giving some of my journal entries to ChatGPT to talk about; but that wasn&#39;t a good idea. For one, I <em>REALLY</em> don&#39;t want to be regularly sharing my thoughts with Google, OpenAI, etc. at such a personal level. Yeah Google knows everything, but my journals are the last private digital domain I have sovereignty over.</p>
<p>Even if the privacy issues were somehow addressed, I&#39;ve got too much text to fit inside a single conversation. Besides, I&#39;ve got very specific needs for the kinda data I want to see.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/flavius/page06.webp" alt="Page06"/></p>
<p>I&#39;m talking Time-Series Aggregation - rolling up days into weeks, weeks into months, months into years, etc. For any given period of time, I want to know the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did I spend most of my time &amp; energy thinking about?</li>
<li>Who was I spending time with? What kind of company did I keep?</li>
<li>What lead me to take the actions I did?</li>
</ul>
<p>Other journaling software can sorta do this, but they&#39;re often too wholesome and focused on <em>their</em> chosen frameworks of wellness and self-improvement. I should be able to read about my daddy issues in CSV.</p>
<p>I want to navigate the connections between people, places, ideas, and actions - to click on people&#39;s names and read more about our interactions. I want to click on feelings mentioned and see other dates where I felt the same way. I want summaries so I can experience a whole month in one page. And I want to have all this privately, on my own device, on my own terms.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why...</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/flavius/page03.webp" alt="Page03"/></p>
<p>I&#39;m creating Charlie; a private, local-first journaling tool that automatically constructs a knowledge graph for you to explore. It&#39;ll connect the dots so you can find patterns of thought &amp; behavior to (hopefully) help raise your self-awareness. &#34;Cool&#34; you might say, but &#34;why is it called Charlie?&#34;. Well...</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/flavius/page04.webp" alt="Page04"/></p>
<p>My current journaling app is called <em>Day</em> One, and I&#39;m inspired by Charlie <em>Day</em> of &#34;It&#39;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&#34; from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOfJzeJIuDo" target="_blank">Pepe Silvia episode</a>. Long story short; he convinces himself that everything is connected and there&#39;s a major conspiracy with him at the center of it, so he covers the room in red yarn to connect all the dots. I&#39;m not planning on losing my mind, but Charlie will probably suck for a while, connecting random things and making shit up; a fun way to fail for a while. Besides, cats love yarn, and every good piece of software needs a mascot. 😼</p>
<p>Say hi to Charlie everyone; he&#39;ll be a regular here from now on.</p>
