<p>Two atomic clocks have been connected using quantum entanglement – a property that intrinsically links them so that changes in one instantaneously affect the other. The connection makes it easier to synchronise the clocks, which could be used to make more accurate measurements of dark matter and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/gravity/">gravity</a>.</p>
<p>Atomic clocks consist of atoms that are very precisely controlled by lasers. Each “tick” corresponds to a frequent and measurable change in energy that occurs in the atoms’ electrons. The result is …</p>
