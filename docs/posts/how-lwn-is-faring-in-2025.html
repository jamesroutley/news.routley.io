    <h1>How LWN is faring in 2025</h1>

Just over six months ago, The Economist described the US economy as &#34;<a href="https://www.economist.com/special-report/2024-10-19">the envy of the
world</a>&#34;.  That headline would be unlikely to appear now.  The economic
boom referenced in that article feels like a distant memory, markets are
falling, and uncertainty is at an all-time high.  Like everybody else, LWN
is affected by the current turbulence in the political and economic
spheres; we expect to get through this period, but there will be some
challenges.
</p><p>
To put it bluntly: starting around the beginning of March, we have observed
a distinct drop in both new subscriptions and renewals.  That timing
roughly corresponds with the US administration&#39;s increasing attacks on the
global system of trade and the economic downturn that has been its result.
As it stands, this subscription drop does not pose an existential threat to
LWN — or to the salaries of its writers — but it is a matter of concern.
</p><p>
We are responding by tightening our belt where we can, but otherwise
working to provide the best coverage of the Linux and free-software
communities, as we always have.  Readers can help, of course, by <a href="https://lwn.net/subscribe/">subscribing</a> if they have not already done so.
Encouraging your employer to set up a <a href="https://lwn.net/op/CorporateSubscriptions.lwn">group subscription</a> is especially
helpful.  Subscriptions are the only thing that has kept LWN operating for
all these years.
</p><p>
Beyond the immediate situation, there are a number of potential problems to
be concerned about.  For example, inflation did not stop after our price
increase in 2022, with the result that subscription dollars buy
significantly less then they once did.  We are <i>not</i> considering a
price increase at this time but, if the situation worsens, we may have to
go there.
</p><p>
For better or worse, LWN is a US-based company, but a large portion of
our subscription sales come from outside the country.  If the backlash
against US companies grows, we are unlikely to escape its effects entirely.
Further attacks on global trade could make it more difficult for us to
accept payments from outside the country, even when the buyer is willing.
In a truly terrible world, there may be attempts to reduce US participation
in (and support for) free software; the probability of that seems low, but
not zero.
</p><p>
Those are all future worries, though. For now, we will focus on getting
through the current economic storms.  The good news is that LWN has been
here since 1998, which is long enough to have been through more than one
difficult cycle.  We are still here, thanks entirely to the steady support
from you, our readers.  Our subscribers, especially, have our gratitude; if
you have not yet subscribed to LWN, please consider doing so now.
</p><p>
Meanwhile our primary focus will remain being worthy of the support you all
have given us since the beginning.  It is the least we can do for all of
you who have made our existence possible for the last 27 years.<br clear="all"/></p><hr/>
