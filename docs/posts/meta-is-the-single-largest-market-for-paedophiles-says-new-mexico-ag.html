trafficking of children and “enabled adults to find, message and groom minors, soliciting them to sell pictures or participate in pornographic videos”, concluding that “Meta’s conduct is not only unacceptable; it is unlawful”.</p><p>Torrez says that he has been shocked by the findings of his team’s investigations into online child sexual exploitation on Meta’s platforms, which included having undercover officers pose as children on Facebook and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/instagram" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Instagram</a>.</p><p>“There was an explosion of sexual interest from users attracted to the undercover accounts that confirmed the scale and pervasiveness of what turned out to be this unregulated space, where unconnected adults had very quickly expressed the kind of sexual interest that we were concerned about,” he says.</p><figure

through all of the relevant business units and executives to understand who knew what and when,” says Torrez.</p><p>He says his work on online child sexual exploitation is “deeply personal” after spending years as a prosecutor working on crimes against children.</p><p>“I have profound memories of interacting with child victims. That motivated me to make this a central component of the case we put together.”</p><p>The idea of the lawsuit came to him after reading media coverage of Meta’s role in child sexual exploitation, including a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/apr/27/how-facebook-and-instagram-became-marketplaces-for-child-sex-trafficking" data-link-name="in body link">Guardian investigation that it was failing to report</a> or detect the use of Facebook and Instagram for child trafficking.

We use sophisticated technology, hire child safety experts, report content to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/children" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Children</a>, and share information and tools with other companies and law enforcement, including state attorneys general, to help root out predators.
