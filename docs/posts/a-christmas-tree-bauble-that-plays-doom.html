<p>Christmas is coming again, and generally that means christmas trees and everything in it:
lights, streamers, and ofcourse baubles. The holiday is all very jolly and everything, so
I decided it was lacking some doom... errm, I mean Doom. So I 3d-printed a small Christmas
bauble modeled on an IBM PC, stuffed it with the tiniest LCD I could find, added a processor
and the logic to make it work as well as a battery. This thing can hang in your Christmas
tree and show the Doom demo mode, including the audio effects and the sound track. And
best of all: if you pair a random BLE keyboard or joystick to it, you can play and kill
millimeter-sized zombies, shotgun guys and imps.</p>

<p>Read on for the details on how I made this.</p>
