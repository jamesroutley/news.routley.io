        At some point in grad school, I encountered what is now one of my favorite works of art in the whole world: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beom">Kim Beom</a>’s <em>Yellow Scream (2012)</em>. I’ll let the piece speak for
        itself—if you don’t watch the whole thing, at least jump to ~5:45 for a few seconds, and then skip around the rest of the recording:

        <em>Yellow Scream</em> became one of my go-to frustration regulators: if I was feeling off, I’d watch the video and invariably feel better.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>

      <p>
        Earlier this year<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> I watched the video and then wanted to do some of my <em>own</em> screaming, so I made a little site for yell-painting a digital
        canvas:

      <p>
        Today feels like an apt day to share both the original performance piece and my interactive homage to it. Are you also feeling off? Why not <a href="https://hannahilea.com/blog/projects/yellow-scream/%22">give yelling a try</a>! To quote Kim Beom,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Prepare some lemon yellow on your palette, and let’s put in some anguished screaming to it.</em></p>
      </blockquote>

        When you’ve gotten some of the yelling out of your system, read the excellent Art Review article <a href="https://artreview.com/kim-beom-do-not-think-at-all/">Kim Beom: Do Not Think at All</a> and
        <a href="https://walkerart.org/magazine/now-streaming-kim-beoms-yellow-scream-2012/">Online Screening: Kim Beom’s <em>Yellow Scream</em> (2012)</a>.

              A labmate friend shared this yellow-as-stress-relief journey with me; I remember one day in particular when I went over to his desk to instigate a Timmies run, and found that his intense concentration wasn’t focussed on
              programming, he was watching <em>Yellow Scream</em>….<a href="#fnref1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>

              I happened to be attending the <a href="http://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> at the time, and the Thursday presentation where I shared it was one of the highlights of my batch. I just looked through my screenshots of
              the hype/enthusiasm/joy in that Zoom chat and am now [re-]filled with warm fuzzies.<a href="#fnref2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a>
