    In 2014, blogger Tim Urban, published a post called &#34;<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">Your Life in Weeks</a>,&#34;
    where he showed a visualization of life as a series of little squares,
    with each one representing a week.
    It&#39;s a powerful, concise way to visualize an entire human life.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site helps you create one of those visualizations for yourself.
    You can use it to track key periods and events in your life,
    see the progress you&#39;ve made over time,
    and easily share your life story with friends and loved ones.
  </p>
  <p>
    I built this app after seeing <a href="https://weeks.ginatrapani.org/">Gina Tripani&#39;s interpretation</a> of the idea,
    and realizing I wanted one for myself.
    And then I thought, well, if I want one maybe other people do too.
  </p>
  <p>
    Check out <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/czue/">my own life in weeks</a> to see what you can build.
