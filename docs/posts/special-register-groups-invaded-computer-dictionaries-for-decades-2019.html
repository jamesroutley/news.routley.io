<p>Half a century ago, the puzzling phrase &#34;special register groups&#34; started showing up in definitions of &#34;CPU&#34;, and it is still there.
In this blog post, I uncover how special register groups went from an obscure feature in the Honeywell 800 mainframe
to appearing in the Washington Post.</p>
<!--
How did the meaningless phrase "special register groups" end up in computer dictionaries for over half a century?
I track how this phrase was was carelessly copied from book to book, eventually appearing in the Washington Post.

In 1959, the now-forgotten Honeywell 800 mainframe had an obscure feature called "special register groups".
Half a century later, this phrase still appears in definitions for "CPU". 

How did the mysterious phrase "special register groups" end up in the definition of Central Processing Unit for
decades?

I kept seeing the puzzling phrase "special register groups" in computer glossaries and dictionaries.
It turns out to be an obscure feature of a 1959 mainframe computer, copied-and-pasted from definition to
definition for decades.


I came across many definitions of CPU that contain the mostly-meaningless phrase "special register groups",
so I decided to investigate.
It turns out that special register groups are a feature of the obscure Honeywell 800 mainframe from 1959.
Somehow "special register groups" got into a government computing glossary, and people have copied the definition
ever since.

-->

<p>While researching old computers, I found a strange definition of &#34;Central Processing Unit&#34; that keeps appearing in different sources. From a book reprinted in 2017:<span id="fnref:reliability"><a href="#fn:reliability" rel="footnote">1</a></span></p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/registergroups/def-reliability-engineering.jpg"><img alt="&#34;Central Processor Unit (CPU)&amp;mdash;Part of a computer system which contains the main storage, arithmetic unit and special register groups. It performs arithmetic operations, controls instruction processing and provides timing signals.&#34;" height="96" src="http://static.righto.com/images/registergroups/def-reliability-engineering-w400.jpg" title="&#34;Central Processor Unit (CPU)&amp;mdash;Part of a computer system which contains the main storage, arithmetic unit and special register groups. It performs arithmetic operations, controls instruction processing and provides timing signals.&#34;" width="400"/></a></p><p>&#34;Central Processor Unit (CPU)â€”Part of a computer system which contains the main storage, arithmetic unit and special register groups. It performs arithmetic operations, controls instruction processing and provides timing signals.&#34;</p>
<p>At first glance, this definition seems okay, but a few moments thought reveals some problems. Storage is not part of the CPU.
<!--
Second, Arithmetic Logic Unit
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit">ALU</a>) is the usual phrase, not Arithmetic Unit.
-->
But more puzzling, what are special register groups? A CPU has registers,
but &#34;special register groups&#34; is not a normal phrase.</p>
<p>It turns out that this definition has been used extensively for over half a century, even though it doesn&#39;t make sense,
copied and modified from one source to another.
Special register groups were a feature in the Honeywell 800 mainframe computer, introduced in 1959.
Although this computer is long-forgotten<span id="fnref:agc"><a href="#fn:agc" rel="footnote">2</a></span>, its impact inexplicably remains in many glossaries.
The Honeywell 800 allowed eight programs to run on a single processor, switching between programs after every instruction.<span id="fnref:multiprogramming"><a href="#fn:multiprogramming" rel="footnote">3</a></span>
To support this, each program had a &#34;special register group&#34; in hardware, its own separate group of 32 registers (program counter, general-purpose registers, index registers, etc.).</p>
<p><a href="http://static.righto.com/images/registergroups/honeywell800.jpg"><img alt="Honeywell 800 computer.

<p>Another important thing to note about that era is the central processing unit was a large physical box, also
known as the &#34;main frame&#34;. (A mainframe was not a type of computer yet.)
Thus, given the characteristics of the Honeywell 800, the definition of CPU in Honeywell&#39;s glossary<span id="fnref:honeywell"><a href="#fn:honeywell" rel="footnote">4</a></span> made total sense.<span id="fnref:oed"><a href="#fn:oed" rel="footnote">5</a></span>
Unfortunately, this definition doesn&#39;t make sense when used for computers in general, since they lack special register groups.</p>

The definition then spread through the government.

<p>This definition persisted into the microcomputer age, even though storage was now clearly not part of the CPU

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>For some reason, a 1960 definition of &#34;central processing unit&#34; included &#34;special register groups&#34;, an obscure feature from the Honeywell 800 mainframe.
This definition was copied and changed for decades, even though it doesn&#39;t make sense.
It appears that once something appears in an authoritative glossary, people will reuse it for decades, and obsolete
terms may never die out.</p>

<p>Researching this phrase also shows how the meanings of computer terms shift greatly over time. In 1960, &#34;main frame&#34; and &#34;CPU&#34; were synonyms,
but since then they have moved in opposite directions: &#34;mainframe&#34; is now a large computer system, while the &#34;CPU&#34;
is usually a processor chip. (I plan to write much more about this.)</p>
