    <h1>Show HN: HCB Mobile – financial app built by 17 y/o, processing $6M/month</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><img width="36" height="36" src="https://github.com/thedev132.png" alt="Mohamad"/>Mohamad Mortada</p><p>Dec 2, 2025</p></div><p>I’m Mohamad, a 17-year-old from the SF Bay Area, and I just shipped the official mobile app for HCB.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t heard of it, HCB is the financial backbone for over <strong>6,500 teenager-led nonprofits</strong>, clubs, and hackathons. We provide <strong>501(c)(3) nonprofit</strong> status, access to a bank account, a donation collection platform, and debit cards for thousands of young people trying to do good in their communities.</p><p>HCB is currently processing an average of <strong>$6 million per month</strong> (over $80M in its lifetime).<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> For the last year, I’ve led the project to build the first-ever mobile app for this entire community.</p><p><em>The entire project is open source on <a href="https://github.com/hackclub/hcb-mobile">GitHub</a> (we&#39;d love a ⭐️!).</em></p><h2>Why build this?</h2><p>These teenagers are running run robotics teams, hackathons, and nonprofit projects that improve their community. They need a way to manage their organization&#39;s finances from their pocket.
With HCB Mobile, they&#39;ll be able to:</p><ul><li>Track their <strong>organization&#39;s balance</strong> and transactions on the go.</li><li>Accept in-person <strong>tap-to-pay donations</strong>, perfect for an in-person fundraiser or event! No extra hardware required. Just tap any credit/debit card against your phone.</li><li><strong>Issue new debit cards</strong>, add them to <strong>Apple / Google Wallet</strong>, and freeze or cancel them directly from their phone.</li><li><strong>Upload receipts</strong> directly from their device or match existing receipts in Receipt Bin to transactions with a tap.</li></ul><h2>The Technical Stuff</h2><p>When I started working on this app, I wanted to build in native code like <strong>SwiftUI</strong> for iOS and <strong>Kotlin/Jetpack Compose</strong> for Android. However, I realized that it would be a pain for me, a <strong>full-time student</strong> with classes, to handle two codebases. I&#39;d have to duplicate every feature I created for one OS to the other and deal with all the integration issues along the way. Then, I discovered <strong>Expo</strong> (a React Native framework) which allowed me to write one app that worked on multiple devices. Working with Expo, I learned about creating my own Expo Modules (to bridge native code features to Typescript) and optimization methods like memoization and component recycling.</p><p>The non-code side of this app was <em>no joke</em>, either. I had to work with the Apple and Google app review teams to obtain <strong>restricted entitlements</strong> for features like mobile <strong>tap-to-pay terminal provisioning</strong> (made possible by Stripe) and <strong>push provisioning</strong> (which allows users to add cards to their payment wallet directly from HCB Mobile). It took several months and many back-and-forth email chains to finally get the entitlements we needed.</p><p>After over 250 hours of development work, I can say that I&#39;m incredibly proud of HCB Mobile because it&#39;s <strong>built by teenagers</strong> to make it easier for teenagers like me to run nonprofit organizations and projects with HCB. Beyond teenagers, HCB also supports hundreds of adult-ran organizations such as mutual aid groups, open source projects, and community spaces.</p></div></div>
