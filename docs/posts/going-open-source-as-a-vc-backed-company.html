    <h1>Going open-source as a VC-Backed company</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Today, we&#39;re launching <a href="https://briefer.cloud/blog/posts/launching-briefer-oss">a free and open-source offering</a>. But I&#39;ll be honest with you: Briefer is a VC-backed company, and it must make money.</p>
<p>It&#39;s ironic to me that many <em>for-profit</em> companies can&#39;t say that out loud. Maybe it&#39;s because they&#39;re afraid that money will get in the way of making users happy. Or maybe they know it won&#39;t, but they&#39;re afraid of people thinking it will.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t think that way.</p>
<p>We think that doing right by your users is the best way to make money, and making money is the best way to do right by your users. That&#39;s because money allows you to invest in improving your product and offer a better service to more people, some of whom will use it for free, and that&#39;s fine.</p>
<p><img src="https://briefer.cloud/posts/open-source-strategy/oss-cycle.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Being clear about our strategy and intentions is part of doing right by our users and it&#39;s why I&#39;m writing this post.</p>
<p>In it, I&#39;ll explain how companies can structure their open-source offerings, and how we structured ours in a way that&#39;s good for users and good for business. I&#39;ll also explain why we chose the AGPL license, how it benefits users, and how it benefits us too. Finally, I&#39;ll also explain some of the things we won&#39;t do, including changing our license.</p>
