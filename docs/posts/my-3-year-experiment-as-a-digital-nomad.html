<p>As a full-time software engineer at Kapwing and full-time wanderer, I&#39;ve learned a few things about how to be a digital nomad.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I got a knock on my door in the middle of the workday. It was Bill, one of the guys who worked on the ranch. ‚ÄúA cow we didn‚Äôt know was pregnant just gave birth,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre naming it after you.‚Äù</p><p>Now, that might be a typical day in the life of a rancher. But I‚Äôm not a rancher.</p><p>I‚Äôm a full-time software engineer. I‚Äôm also a digital nomad and have been since 2020.</p><h3 id="why-i-became-a-digital-nomad">Why I became a digital nomad</h3><p>Working at Kapwing, which has a flexible remote work policy, I‚Äôm able to work from anywhere‚Äîso I do.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/WJnhl_x3nq3SXmdIr2xFPjrvLeNa1debRL3TBmXBLvZBYqWITRaN2y6MjMXk_62xf22dR_0AGzUawVrYkdxOabPEjcvaHxqc2G-RxpPNMX6tVExBFdWbQzHfonicxQEwj8rv1MSyRgKrNIsGvOPmTCw" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1079"/></figure><p>The way I see it, there‚Äôs so much natural beauty in the world and only so much time. Without being anchored to any one location, I can get out into nature more often, see the mountains and beautiful views, and do it without taking a ton of PTO. If I‚Äôm going to spend the workweek, well, working, I might as well do it somewhere pretty.</p><p>That said, the logistics of digital nomadism can be challenging. </p><p>Not just in terms of figuring out your set up and routine. But relationships become harder, too. When people in my life have big life events that I want to show up for, I‚Äôm often not near an airport and have to figure out how to get back to whichever part of the country they‚Äôre in. Wedding season in particular is difficult (IYKYK).</p><p>Truthfully, becoming a digital nomad required a lot of trial and error on my part. Along the way, I&#39;d say I tried out three different ‚Äústyles‚Äù of nomadic lifestyle:</p><ol><li>The Airbnb Nomad</li><li>The Vanlife</li><li>The Full-time Wanderer</li></ol><p>There are stark differences and pros and cons to each. So I‚Äôll break down each approach, how things went for me, and share some lessons I‚Äôve gathered over the last three and a half years.</p><h2 id="option-1-become-an-airbnb-nomad-%F0%9F%8F%A0">Option #1: Become an Airbnb Nomad üè†</h2><p>This is how I got started.</p><p>I was living in Philadelphia in early 2020, working remotely in the music industry. A few months after the onset of COVID, I decided to ditch my lease and hit the road. I started by booking 4-week stays, the minimum length required to get the 30% monthly discount, at different Airbnb properties, traveling on the weekends and working during the week.</p><p>Eventually, I bought a Tesla Model Y to save on lodging costs during longer trips between locations. The Model Y has plenty of space for sleeping and can be outfitted with a custom-fit mattress pad, so it‚Äôs actually quite comfortable.<br/></p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/fGU9Ieu1w-aTns6k6T0pE3xWPdRTrt5rUphJ2I4MyS1dNegmdmb8D3fdUQgHzlpHY8ylh_ubB9nVJHahNaV4RYjzcBwQJDgGqgKW8Z0NhfWtmsjDgh0CoUCBc2R9X9QeuMSTAz52HBirUiZXOPBvmBo" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1664" height="935"/><figcaption>There‚Äôs enough space in the Model Y to haul a mattress and my desk setup.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="why-i-like-the-airbnb-nomad-lifestyle">Why I like the Airbnb Nomad lifestyle</h3><p>This is probably the easiest way to get started as a digital nomad. There aren‚Äôt any huge investments you need to make up front, you still have the comforts of home at each Airbnb, and you can try it out without too much risk. You don‚Äôt even need to break your lease if you just want to test-drive nomadic life for a month or two.</p><p>Another reason I really liked the Airbnb route is that you have a built-in local guide to hang out with, thanks to your host. I met a lot of cool people traveling around this way (and had at least one cow named after me). Plus, there are lots of great spots in rural places you might never typically visit that open up to you with this method of traveling.</p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2024/01/image.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image.png 1000w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/image.png 1600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2024/01/image.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Charging up the car at my casita Airbnb in Tombstone, Arizona</figcaption></figure><h3 id="what-you-need-as-an-airbnb-nomad">What you need as an Airbnb Nomad</h3><p>Like I said, this method doesn‚Äôt require much in terms of upfront costs or purchases, however there are a few things that I highly recommend.</p><p><strong>1. An ergonomic desk set up. </strong>I quickly learned that I <em>needed</em> an ergonomic chair and a good desk in order to make this work. As a software engineer, I‚Äôm sitting at my computer all day. A hardback chair and dining table at the Airbnb just aren‚Äôt going to cut it. Fortunately, my Tesla has enough room to bring both my desk and chair with me from place to place. </p><p><strong>2. Supplementary WiFi. </strong>This might not be necessary at every Airbnb, but if you‚Äôre picking places out in the middle of nowhere, consider bringing a backup connection.</p><p><strong>3. A vehicle equipped for car camping.</strong> Having a vehicle large enough to sleep in really increased my range of travel when moving between Airbnbs while still keeping costs down. Plus, you can travel more on the weekends with your Airbnb as home base.</p><h2 id="option-2-become-a-vanlifer-%F0%9F%9A%90">Option #2: Become a Vanlifer üöê</h2><p>After a while, I realized that sleeping in the Tesla was perfectly comfortable and gave me way more freedom. That‚Äôs when I moved from being an Airbnb Nomad to being a Vanlifer. Although I never had a van. Just my Tesla.</p><p><strong>If you haven&#39;t heard the term, </strong>car camping (or &#34;vanlife&#34;) is when you rely on the public for amenities like showers, food, and a place to work. You can replace the bed in your Airbnb with your car camping setup, but you still need to find a place to shower, eat, and make a living. Luckily, it‚Äôs pretty common to find towns, even rural towns, that have a Planet Fitness, coworking space, and even an EV charger.</p><h3 id="why-i-like-the-vanlife">Why I like the Vanlife</h3><p>As a full-time employee, using coworking spaces is the most convenient way to be a digital nomad. Depending on what kind of setup you have, you might find vanlife even more appealing.</p><p>With just the Tesla, I was saving quite a bit of money on lodging, but spending more on food because I didn‚Äôt have a cooking setup, which was a definite drawback. Plus, you get tired of eating out after a while. If you have a full van build-out, though, you might have a kitchenette that suits your needs just fine.</p><p>Although I found it somewhat annoying needing to be near a city at all times during the work week, the increased mobility made up for it. I was able to move daily if I wanted to because everything I needed was self-contained within my car. I also didn‚Äôt need to reserve the weekends for traveling between locations, anymore, which meant I had more time for exploring. </p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/hEzyN20PHZ5I5jJXGOV-R1PHlZty03TN2RYs-UVIGVd0AdBmMsUFlbJH_WB_eQlJN38dzxri1oPNeyblUS_3bKHafP4JkMvMFNdOhkKpDA7n6mlv7_CYiTxeQKoh6rY1eTHqxt8i441JbvIL4YdvHcI" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1079"/><figcaption>Off-roading with the Tesla in Dotsero, CO.</figcaption></figure><p>Working from a coworking space or coffee shop, I‚Äôd get all of my human interaction during the week, then on the weekends I had the range and off-road capabilities to get out into the wilderness and just be alone in nature.</p><h3 id="what-you-need-as-a-vanlifer">What you need as a Vanlifer</h3><p>Here‚Äôs my recommended starter kit for becoming a vanlifer as a full-time employee.</p><p><strong>1. A suitable vehicle. </strong>I‚Äôm calling it vanlife, but you don‚Äôt actually have to buy a kitted out Sprinter van to make this happen. I did it with just my Tesla Model Y. At minimum, you‚Äôll need a car, truck, or van that you can comfortably sleep in.</p><p><strong>2. Planet Fitness (or similar) membership. </strong>Unless you have an RV or Airstream, you need somewhere to shower. When I was all-in on vanlife, I had a membership to Planet Fitness, because those gyms are just about everywhere, which made for easy shower and bathroom access wherever I went.</p><p><strong>3. Access to a coworking space or place to work.</strong> This is more a logistical consideration. Does the city you‚Äôre headed to have a coworking space? Sometimes you can get a membership, although then you‚Äôre even further restricted to that specific coworking franchise‚Äôs locations. I recommend just sticking with the day rate. If there are no coworking spaces, you can always post up in the local library or coffee shop.</p><p><strong>4. Access to car charging or RV hookups. </strong>Depending on what kind of vehicle you have, you might need to take this into consideration, too. Driving the Model Y, I needed to make sure there was always an EV charging station in the cities I visited.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/xsj-MbSGhImQYafmypSaUj9Hjd1tWF1IXNyF9oQBCVZoKyvXDJZECk9-274cL23Nn8yXZMWuF5CoCEdMxBkDdCCZJD4z_JtK5xao42L1oh1kj6fhD9P4AbiyiD1nZtou3Xf71tBRTQvoh3vW0NkNIg0" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1079"/><figcaption>Casual glacier views in Hyder, AK.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="option-3-become-a-full-time-wanderer-%F0%9F%A5%BE">Option #3: Become a Full-time Wanderer ü•æ</h2><p>The final evolution of my digital nomadism, at least so far, has been full-time wandering with a trailer setup. </p><figure><img src="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/2024/01/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2024/01/image-1.png 600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2024/01/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2024/01/image-1.png 1600w, https://www.kapwing.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2024/01/image-1.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Setting up camp outside the Valley of Fire</figcaption></figure><p>While vanlife was convenient, I found that I missed being able to get out and away from the cities for extended periods. While I enjoyed my minimalist setup with just the Tesla, I decided towing a trailer would give me that extra self-sufficiency I was looking for. </p><h3 id="why-i-like-the-full-time-wanderer-lifestyle">Why I like the Full-Time Wanderer lifestyle</h3><p>Similar to when I was doing long-term Airbnb stays, it‚Äôs nice to have all my creature comforts with me wherever I go. My daily routine looks pretty much the same as most people‚Äôs now, because my trailer has all the typical home amenities.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/42ktOK7w53C5URUkEE7T9dkIJ2qLZFkr3kiNIvv13lZQDzphaX9lcXb9rQJNi7j3covetY-PY5GkQswSnVNX65pg5MPY_WiK7SIcsPLp7A2o8SMv4Y4ak5Sp78RSuLDckOHXlTMy7n6UCZMcWRz7wPg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1246" height="700"/><figcaption>My trailer setup with solar panels outside of Monticello, Utah</figcaption></figure><p>I have a kitchen, a full bathroom with a shower, two beds, and even a whole office space inside the trailer.</p><p>One thing that‚Äôs not super optimal, unfortunately, is that I‚Äôm towing my trailer with an electric vehicle, something it‚Äôs not really designed for.</p><p>That means my range while hauling the trailer is pretty limited. With the extra weight, a charge will only last about 60 miles, rather than the standard ~300 it normally gets. That means moving from location to location takes quite a bit longer, so I reserve that for weekends. Recently, I was hopping back and forth between Grand Junction, CO and Moab, UT‚Äîa distance of 113 miles. I had to go about halfway, stop, unhitch the trailer, then go back and charge the Tesla up again before finishing the trip. It makes travel days very slow.</p><p>I like lingering in one place longer anyway, so I don‚Äôt have to move the trailer all that often. Plus, with the Model Y I still have the option to go car camping with the Tesla. I just drop the trailer as a home base and can make multiple little trips around the area or even further afield.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/70T-GLovmzjr0B2B0sRYxKUmuS6WmwDEesPO9bhGfi0aH5OHWQY6rW2hdq_Jnbf-9iqyWzFNR709_9QGsyZw6-_hQL2Y-OS-pT7ER-kdm7WtYkqL3EfB6KO0VkhP87Oz3hfxwHbsoLuZdpEOnicrn9Y" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1730" height="972"/><figcaption>Sometimes I just set up my desk outside, wherever I am and work in nature.</figcaption></figure><p>Recently, I‚Äôve added some solar panels to my setup. I don‚Äôt generate enough power to charge the car, but it will run my trailer‚Äôs electrical plus my internet, which makes being self-sufficient much easier. I tend to follow the sun to optimize my solar panel usage and a few other logistical reasons, so it‚Äôs always pretty good weather wherever I‚Äôm going which is a nice bonus.</p><h3 id="what-you-need-as-a-full-time-wanderer">What you need as a Full-time Wanderer</h3><p>Your experience with the full-time trailer lifestyle will probably vary if you‚Äôre not trying to tow it with an electric car, but there are a few essentials you‚Äôll need:</p><p><strong>1. Reliable internet connection. </strong>With Airbnbs or coworking spaces, you typically have access to fast, reliable internet. Taking the self-sufficient trailer route, though, you‚Äôll need to supply your own. I use <a href="https://www.starlink.com/">Starlink</a>, which meets my needs most of the time. I‚Äôve learned to have a few redundancies in place, though. Cell signal to power a hotspot is ideal, but not always available. Starlink is a little more temperamental but it‚Äôs faster and great for areas where you can‚Äôt get a cell signal.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/SRQY9lYB1oFqLi7ATVyB_kE8PDJ0e9tAV-FzmQN6yPwxL27734sl_hVgWxfHSYZShIV4MXRyYndX8W69ig-skOYXyxIvkqA6kKuMuIaxnfaxNfX9AEhh2p-eZCl4_YCOAHJz4NTfOswt4P8aiHOn-x8" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1079"/></figure><p><strong>2. Temperate weather.</strong> There are seasonal limitations to living out of a trailer. Specifically, you can‚Äôt let the pipes freeze. I spent the summer and autumn visiting the more extreme climates, but as soon as temperatures started to dip I took the trailer to a more temperate area. Currently, I‚Äôm just outside of Las Vegas.</p><p><strong>3. Access to a water fill station. </strong>Part of self-sufficiency is having access to running water inside your trailer, which means you need somewhere to fill up your water tank. I‚Äôve found that I can fill my tank on the weekends and that will last me a whole week with enough water for showering, cooking, and drinking.</p><h2 id="digital-nomad-setups-i%E2%80%99ve-tried-that-didn%E2%80%99t-work">Digital nomad setups I‚Äôve tried that didn‚Äôt work</h2><p>With nearly four years of trial and error, there are bound to be some things that didn‚Äôt work for me. Here are a couple of failed experiments from my time on the road:</p><h3 id="1-using-my-car-as-an-office">1. Using my car as an office.</h3><p>I thought maybe the Tesla display could work as an extra monitor, but the chair isn‚Äôt in the right position for hours of work. I‚Äôve mentioned before that I literally hauled around my own desk and chair to different Airbnbs because an ergonomic setup is so important in my line of work. And working from my car just wasn‚Äôt ergonomic at all<em>.</em></p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/d-tf2AUffkyD83TgAWJyYSkrM8adR_BdvF5ESAaQn3WM-8h_e8pecsoaCU-kYq0cwJqMVjy9eveSQivO_RkAFvzNnV-wf17PY7jai6wFZPGiQSno3TrS0xsvA5L8PI0cTg4y4_hrnrPxDN7jbnjCOh4" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1728" height="1296"/><figcaption>You can see how cramped the workspace setup was in the front seat of the Tesla.</figcaption></figure><p>So, yeah, skip the Tesla display when building your digital nomad battle station. Your back will thank you.</p><h3 id="2-building-out-a-floating-office">2. Building out a floating office.</h3><p>At one point, I tried building a floating office onto my tow hitch, my thought process being that it would free me up to travel farther with just the Tesla, since I would have a mobile work station. I got as far as a working prototype before realizing that it wasn‚Äôt going to work. At least, not without way more effort and customization than I was willing to put in.</p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/4XHMgySm19rrHK5M2dOxfrObodKBOGOTD4F4egrq5frQkOD0DSCEh5kR51a6dCRl-duPg683anCWI5NKZW82-5x2yquoK8_kwWj5C4-TBuVNbkWNAISLpI9_hGKITuxb7wUiPPR9K0yVS9WUqBSXv5g" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1536"/></figure><p>The main problem was that I couldn‚Äôt reduce glare, wind, and weather enough for functional work, despite the various umbrella configurations I attempted. It also wasn‚Äôt ergonomic‚Äîmy feet would kind of hang in the air while I was sitting at the desk, so not a good long term solution. <br/></p><figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/xV8zdLehqmwK5LNngAOqFAm8MCWg52V3CXjFtuLLTMsVJKhwCk5Qd1Pxa77E4Xp-SSKj9V18btg10HVOn3jCqFAPDU9UZQSy1zBa0_zvgCTsv--JVIDk1luaqBZqj6WWDQJ-ajTW1gUNOcWZsrnvm3E" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080"/><figcaption>Believe it or not, I drove down the highway with this contraption affixed to the back of my car.</figcaption></figure><p>It was around this point that I started looking into just getting a trailer.</p><h2 id="what%E2%80%99s-next-for-me-as-a-digital-nomad">What‚Äôs next for me as a digital nomad?</h2><p>I‚Äôm currently waiting out the winter season with my trailer parked here in Nevada, planning to travel around a bit without the trailer. Next summer, I‚Äôm taking the trailer all the way up to Alaska.</p><p>With so many different ways to be a digital nomad available to me, I don‚Äôt currently have any plans to go back to a single, permanent home base. It&#39;s a somewhat unique lifestyle that takes work to pull off, but it&#39;s one I&#39;m really enjoying.</p>
