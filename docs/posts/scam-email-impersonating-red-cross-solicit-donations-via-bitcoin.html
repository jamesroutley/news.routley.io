    <h1>Scam Email – Impersonating Red Cross – Solicit Donations via Bitcoin</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                            <td>
                                                
  
                                                <div><p>Earlier today, I received a scam email that impersonates the Ukrainian Red Cross. It attempts to solicit donations via Bitcoin. The email is almost certainly not related to any valid Red Cross effort.</p>

<p>There are some legitimate efforts to collect donations for Ukraine using crypto-currencies. This scam may take advantage of these efforts.</p>

<p>The scam wasn&#39;t hard to spot, but as people are looking for ways to help, some may fall for it. So far, the address has received about $10 in Bitcoin. Someone may already have been scammed.</p>

<p>If you are soliciting funds for charitable purposes: Please make sure you are providing verifiable information. Even bank account numbers (not just Bitcoin addresses) may be fake. Best to link to a website of charity with respective information.</p>

<p>As suggested by the email, I am going to reply and will update this post if I get a response.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><tt>Our heart&#39;s bleeds greatly at the worsening situation in Ukraine. Posterity will judge us; if we nonchalantly ignore the on-going war in Ukraine- Russia. As a matter of urgency, we are called in every humanly way possible to help restore peace and alleviate pain in the affected areas.</tt></p>



<p><tt>We at International Community/committee of Red Cross requests kindly for your donations in money, prayers, sacrifices. </tt></p>



<p><tt>To make your donations; follow these steps: We look forward to your charitable donations. </tt></p>



<p><tt>Make a bitcoin donation to this following address 364fYEU6U4D8zt4EG2oxVZcYo2ovGYZioD </tt></p>



<p><tt>For other payment method kindly reply to this email. </tt></p>



<p><tt>Yours faithfully, </tt></p>
