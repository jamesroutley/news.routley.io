    <h1>Boeing Whistleblower Before Death: &#34;If Anything Happens, It&#39;s Not Suicide&#34;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>&#34;I know that he did not commit suicide.&#34;</h2><h2>Curious Causes</h2><p>As Boeing continues <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/jet-tire-falls-off">to be in the news</a> for its <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/plane-wing-breaking-footage">repeatedly</a> <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/boeing-plane-fire">malfunctioning</a> <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/boeing-trouble-crack-cockpit">planes</a>, the fallout from one ex-employee&#39;s death continues — and new reports complicate the coroner&#39;s initial suicide ruling.</p><p>In an <a href="https://abcnews4.com/news/local/if-anything-happens-its-not-suicide-boeing-whistleblowers-prediction-before-death-south-carolina-abc-news-4-2024">interview with Charleston, South Carolina&#39;s <em>ABC4 News</em></a>, a friend of Boeing whistleblower John Barnett, whose body was found dead in a car parked in a hotel lot amid his testimony against his former employer last weekend, said that he warned her that something might happen to him.</p><p>&#34;I said, &#39;Aren&#39;t you scared?&#39;&#34; the woman, who gave only her first name Jennifer, told the local broadcaster. &#34;And he said, &#39;No, I ain&#39;t scared, but if anything happens to me, it&#39;s not suicide.&#39;&#34;</p><p>Jennifer said that Barnett&#39;s words were spoken ahead of his deposition against Boeing. At the time, he&#39;d mentioned that the company had retaliated against him for raising safety concerns before — which was, indeed, the subject of his Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) <a href="https://www.corporatecrimereporter.com/news/200/john-barnett-on-why-he-wont-fly-on-a-boeing-787-dreamliner/">complaint</a> that led to his now-unfinished deposition.</p><p>The woman, who lives in the whistleblower&#39;s home state of Louisiana where he&#39;d moved in recent years to take care of his aging mother, said that that cryptic warning has come back to haunt her since Barnett&#39;s death, which a coroner in Charleston says was self-inflicted.</p><p>&#34;I know that he did not commit suicide,&#34; Jennifer told <em>ABC4</em>. &#34;There&#39;s no way. He loved life too much. He loved his family too much. He loved his brothers too much to put them through what they&#39;re going through right now.&#34;</p><h2>Hearsay</h2><p>She&#39;s not alone in that sentiment either, it seems.</p><p>In a statement to <em>Futurism</em>, Barnett&#39;s attorneys said that they also &#34;<a href="https://futurism.com/boeing-whistleblowers-lawyers-statement">didn&#39;t see any indication</a>&#34; that the whistleblower may have been planning to take his own life, and that he&#39;d seemed in &#34;good spirits&#34; as his deposition was coming to a close.</p><p>Not everyone close to the longtime Boeing quality control manager agrees with that sentiment, however.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-787-whistleblower-found-dead-in-apparent-suicide/">interview with the <em>Seattles Times</em></a>, Barnett&#39;s niece, Katelyn Gillespie, said that her &#34;fun uncle&#34; had become &#34;stressed and depressed&#34; in recent months as his ex-employer was in the news amid the same kinds of safety concerns he&#39;d raised and ultimately resigned over.</p><p>&#34;He battled a lot due to the Boeing stuff,&#34; the whistleblower&#39;s niece said. &#34;It took a major toll on him.&#34;</p><p>Despite the Charleston County coroner&#39;s preliminary autopsy report on the cause of death being a self-inflicted gunshot wound and that local police found, <a href="https://www.live5news.com/2024/03/12/brave-honest-man-boeing-whistleblowers-attorneys-release-statement-his-death/">per the city&#39;s <em>Live 5 News</em></a>, &#34;some sort of note,&#34; authorities said they are still actively investigating the case while awaiting an official coroner&#39;s ruling.</p><p>As in other <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/jul/16/david-kelly-death-10-years-on">suspicious</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/dhs-whistleblower-philip-haney-death-ruled-suicide/">whistleblower</a> <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/05/17/robert-mcfarlane-death-national-security-advisor-iran-contra/">suicides</a>, it&#39;s almost impossible for anyone to know exactly what happened when Barnett died — but with this new claim from someone close to Barnett, things just got a lot more complicated.</p><p><strong>More on Boeing:</strong> <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/pilot-boeing-gauges-nosedive"><em>Pilot Lost Control of Boeing Jet Because Gauges “Went Blank,&#34; Causing Nosedive</em></a></p></div></div>
