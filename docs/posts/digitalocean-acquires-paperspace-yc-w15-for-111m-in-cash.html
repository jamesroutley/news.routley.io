The acquisition and integration of Paperspace’s advanced technology into the DigitalOcean platform will extend DigitalOcean’s offerings, enabling customers to more easily test, develop and deploy artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) applications, augment and enhance existing AI/ML applications and utilize GPUs in ways that have predominantly been the domain of large enterprises.</p><p>The increasing demand for AI/ML cloud solutions makes Paperspace’s GPU-powered infrastructure and AI/ML focused software stack valuable additions to DigitalOcean’s portfolio. Like DigitalOcean’s approach to the cloud, Paperspace simplifies the AI/ML experience, enabling easy and cost-effective experimentation and production across various AI/ML use cases, such as generative media, text analysis and natural language understanding, recommendation engines, image classification and many others.</p><p>The acquisition benefits both organizations’ customers.

The combined offerings allow customers to focus more on building applications and growing their businesses and less on the infrastructure powering them.&#34;</p><p>Paperspace will benefit from DigitalOcean’s highly effective self-serve model and efficient go-to-market strategy. The acquisition expands DigitalOcean’s serviceable market and presents cross-sell and upsell opportunities for both entities, leveraging DigitalOcean&#39;s mature platform, efficient marketing engine and its extensive customer base to drive growth.</p><p>&#34;DigitalOcean is renowned for simplifying complex cloud technologies and making them more accessible to developers and business alike,&#34; said Dillon Erb, Co-founder and CEO of Paperspace. &#34;We are thrilled to join forces with DigitalOcean, as we believe there is no better company to unlock the endless possibilities of AI/Ml for developers and businesses alike.&#34;</p><p>Importantly, the alignment in organizational history and culture between DigitalOcean and Paperspace will ensure a smooth integration process and a collaborative work environment. The two companies’ shared values and commitment to customer success will continue to foster innovation, enhance customer experiences, and reinforce both entities as industry leaders in cloud computing.</p><p><b>Transaction Terms</b></p><p>Under the terms of the transaction, DigitalOcean acquired Paperspace for $111 million in cash.
