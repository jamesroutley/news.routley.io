    <h1>Consequence-Weighted ROI - A First Step</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>ROI is a finance acronym for </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp" rel="">return on investment</a><span>. For example: if I invest $1000 in something, how profitable will that investment ultimately be? ROI is often expressed in terms of today’s dollars using a </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp" rel="">net present value</a><span> (NPV) calculation. NPV is a valuation method that discounts future cash flows back to the present. That essentially means </span><em>it</em><span> </span><em>values the future lower than the present.</em></p><p><span>Here’s an example of NPV in action: you invest $10000 in a startup that you anticipate will produce a $100000 payout to you five years from now (for example, you think the startup will get acquired). In year 0 (today), your outlay is $10000 in today’s dollars. But if the “</span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/discountrate.asp" rel="">discount rate</a><span>” (aka the rate at which money depreciates) is 5%, then five years from now, the NPV (amount in today’s dollars) of your payout will be less than $100000, according to this formula: </span></p><blockquote><p>C / (1 + r)^n</p><p><span>where:</span></p></blockquote><p>Here’s the calculation of your expected payout at the end of year five: </p><blockquote><p><span>100000 / (1.05)^5 = 78353</span><a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" rel="">1</a><span> </span></p></blockquote><p><span>You’re not going to get $100000 in today’s dollars. But in pure mathematical terms, you should still make the investment, because $78353 is more than your $10000 initial investment, which means an expected profit of $68353 in today’s dollars ($78353 minus your initial outlay of $10000). Unless you can get a better return on your $10000 elsewhere, you should invest in the startup (if it’s within your risk appetite</span><a id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" rel="">2</a><span>)!</span></p><p><strong>What does this mean for risk management? </strong></p><p><span>A few things. For risk management investments, the question is often a little different: If I spend $1000 on a mitigation measure, </span><em><strong>how much loss will I probably prevent, and will the loss prevented outweigh the expense?</strong></em><span> This can be a harder sell when pitching investments to senior management, since loss prevention can be hard to quantify. </span></p><p><span>Encryption software to prevent data loss or theft, for example, may cost $100000 in direct software costs and labor costs up-front, plus $20000 per year for maintenance and support. It’s probably not going to earn your company </span><em>anything</em><span>. Ouch. But if the software prevents five data loss incidents per year, and each incident costs on average $50000, suddenly it starts to look like a great investment, </span><em>if </em><span>you can accurately quantify the expected savings and convince senior management. </span></p><p>Here’s the calculation over a three-year time horizon: </p><blockquote><p><span>-100000 / (1.05)^0 + (250000 - 20000) / (1.05)^1 + (250000 - 20000) / (1.05)^2 </span></p><p>= -100000 + 219048 + 208617 + 198683 </p><p>= $526347</p></blockquote><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F335eeed6-ec1c-43d0-a373-9ccabe9a8397_455x230.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F335eeed6-ec1c-43d0-a373-9ccabe9a8397_455x230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F335eeed6-ec1c-43d0-a373-9ccabe9a8397_455x230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F335eeed6-ec1c-43d0-a373-9ccabe9a8397_455x230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F335eeed6-ec1c-43d0-a373-9ccabe9a8397_455x230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F335eeed6-ec1c-43d0-a373-9ccabe9a8397_455x230.png" width="455" height="230" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/335eeed6-ec1c-43d0-a373-9ccabe9a8397_455x230.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:230,&#34;width&#34;:455,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:41997,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F335eeed6-ec1c-43d0-a373-9ccabe9a8397_455x230.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F335eeed6-ec1c-43d0-a373-9ccabe9a8397_455x230.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F335eeed6-ec1c-43d0-a373-9ccabe9a8397_455x230.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F335eeed6-ec1c-43d0-a373-9ccabe9a8397_455x230.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Now, consider what happens to the math if a massive theft of unencrypted personally identifiable information (PII) in a jurisdiction with strict privacy laws would cost $20 million in fines, plus additional costs related to offering consumer credit monitoring services, legal expenses, and reputational damage.

We’ll introduce weighting factor W, which will be multiplied by time period t, and we’ll use our consequence-weighted equation to calculate the far-future benefits of the investment:</span><strong> </strong><span> </span></p><blockquote><p>C / (1+r)^(t*W)</p></blockquote><p><span>I’m going to set W equal to 0.1, applying a 10x weighting since the outcome without this investment is </span><em>unacceptable.</em><span> Note: there is no standard for consequence-weighted ROI yet, so a different weighting might turn out to be more optimal.</span><a id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" rel="">5</a><span> </span><em><span>Whatever the agreed-upon value of W, it should remain constant for all investments that are made to prevent or mitigate </span><strong>unacceptable</strong><span> risks.</span></em><span> An agreed-upon standard would allow consistent comparison of different must-do investments and prioritization of the ones with the greatest expected ROI.</span></p><p>So let’s do this consequence-weighted calculation of the savings realized by averting an unacceptable outcome: </p><blockquote><p>1,500,000,000,000 / (1.05)^(78*.1) = $1,025,214,467,805</p></blockquote><p>Here’s the spreadsheet version of the calculation incorporating consequence-weighted ROI: </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7278601-801d-4ad2-921a-61776e029922_459x482.png" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7278601-801d-4ad2-921a-61776e029922_459x482.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7278601-801d-4ad2-921a-61776e029922_459x482.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7278601-801d-4ad2-921a-61776e029922_459x482.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7278601-801d-4ad2-921a-61776e029922_459x482.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7278601-801d-4ad2-921a-61776e029922_459x482.png" width="459" height="482" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b7278601-801d-4ad2-921a-61776e029922_459x482.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:482,&#34;width&#34;:459,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:95485,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7278601-801d-4ad2-921a-61776e029922_459x482.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7278601-801d-4ad2-921a-61776e029922_459x482.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7278601-801d-4ad2-921a-61776e029922_459x482.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb7278601-801d-4ad2-921a-61776e029922_459x482.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>That’s $1.025 trillion saved in exchange for our investment of $50 billion per year for ten years.

Traditional NPV calculations say, “Not much.” But it increasingly looks like that answer is wrong</span><em>. </em><span>Climate change advocates routinely talk about the effects that changes made </span><em>now </em><span>or </span><em>soon </em><span>will have by the year 2100.
