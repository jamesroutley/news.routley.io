<p>There aren&#39;t many games for which built-in integration with Microsoft Excel would be a major feature whose announcement would draw literal cheers from fans. But <em>Eve Online</em> showed itself to be the exception when developer CCP announced coming Excel integration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri6eTeCBUww">during its Eve Fanfest keynote this morning</a>.</p>
<p>Through an official partnership with Microsoft, CCP said it is creating a JavaScript API that will allow players to &#34;seamlessly export data from <em>Eve Online</em>&#34; into the popular spreadsheet program. That &#34;will help players access and calculate everything from profit margins to battle strategy, making day-to-day <em>Eve</em> operations easier to execute,&#34; the company said in <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2022/05/06/eve-fanfest-2022-ushering-in-a-new-era-for-eve-online-empowering-players-to-shape-the-future-of-new-edens-cornerstone-empires/">a press release</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;It&#39;s not April fools; this is real,&#34; <em>Eve Online</em> Creative Director Bergur Finnbogason said on the Fanfest stage, receiving bemused laughter in response. &#34;I&#39;m not lying—we actually reached out to [Microsoft] and they were like, &#39;Oh my god, we love <em>Eve</em>!&#39;&#34;</p>
<h2>Spreadsheets in space!</h2>
<p>Joking references to <em>Eve Online</em>&#39;s reputation as a &#34;spreadsheets in space&#34; simulator <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/eve-online-boss-apologizes-for-everything/">date back</a> well over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/eve-online/user-reviews/2200-485091/">a decade</a> at this point. And CCP leaned into that reputation at Fanfest, with Finnbogason joking that a data-filled presentation on the game&#39;s economy by <a href="https://twitter.com/ccp_larrikin">data scientist CCP Larrikin</a> &#34;really, really, really, really make[s] Eve sound like &#39;spreadsheets in space.&#39; It&#39;s hard to be a creative director sometimes when you have all the spreadsheet loving.&#34;</p>
<p>Despite that, Finnbogason went on to acknowledge that &#34;data is massively important to many advanced playstyles in <em>Eve</em>.&#34; And it&#39;s true; many individual players and in-game corporations <a href="https://forums.eveonline.com/t/eve-finance-a-financial-tool-for-capsuleers/321563">use</a> external <a href="https://forums.eveonline.com/t/evewarreport-com-create-your-own-war-reports/204468">tools</a> and spreadsheets to track their resource production and destruction metrics in extreme detail. That data tracking can be key to efforts to maximize in-game currency, which can in turn be <a href="https://evepraisal.com/item/44992">traded for additional game subscription time</a> on the open market.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>At Fanfest, though, Finnbogason noted that &#34;the initial cost of setting up these [data-tracking] systems can be pretty daunting for small groups.&#34; Built-in Excel integration for <em>Eve Online</em> data should &#34;simplify the access to data for all&#34; and &#34;level the playground when it comes to the tools of the sandbox,&#34; he said.</p>
<p>&#34;Whether satisfying your curiosity or maximizing your industrial enterprise or managing your frontline warfare, it&#39;s in your hands to create the tools for your advancement,&#34; he said.</p>

<p>CCP already helps data-obsessed players with <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/news/view/monthly-economic-report-february-2022">graph-filled monthly reports</a> on everything from resource-mining production to regional NPC bounties. It&#39;s all part of the company&#39;s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/02/how-eve-online-builds-emotion-out-of-its-strict-in-game-economy/">ongoing</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/04/eve-onlines-success-shows-why-gaming-doesnt-need-nfts/">surprisingly successful</a> two-decade effort to actively manage its complex in-game economy. The goal, as CCP Larrikin put it on stage at Fanfest, is to create an &#34;equitable distribution of resources&#34; that will lead to more player satisfaction and a better game.
</p><p>While a short demo of <em>Eve Online</em>&#39;s Excel integration drew legitimate cheers from the Fanfest audience, Finnbogason said the API tools were still in the &#34;early phase&#34; and that the company will be &#34;sharing more later in the year.&#34; That said, Finnbogason added that &#34;this is pretty wild stuff,&#34; and we have to agree.
