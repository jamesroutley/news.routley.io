    <h1>Where Do Laws Come From?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>My Martial Arts teacher of almost 20 years, Thad, recently sent me an episode of <a href="https://www.themythicbody.com/podcast/">The Emerald</a> podcast on where <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-clouds-and-cosmic-law/id1465445746?i=1000652122407">Laws</a> – cosmic laws and human laws, and how laws are really like patterns.</p>



<p>Laws are one of those things that I have been thinking about for a while. </p>



<p>In the film class I used to teach: Robots, Computer and Film, a common theme was the replacement of court room dramas with detective noirs.  In film after film we saw detectives like Deckard in Blade Runner, John Anderton in Minority Report, Agent Smith in the Matrix, but we never saw a legal scene, government legislation, or a court house. We did not see how the law was created but only how it as enforced.</p>



<h2>The law is the algorithm. It is written by a programmer, a human or perhaps by an AI (like ChatGPT), and then it is just executed – enforced by the machine of society. </h2>



<p>Perhaps the creation of laws is not that dramatic to watch, or narrate. </p>



<p>Classicist and Jungian Peter Kingsley writes In the Wisdom of Dark Places writes about the myth of Orpheus as depicted on greek vases.  When Orpheus, the legendary poet and musician visits the underworld to rescue his beloved Eurydice – he meets the goddess Justice. Justice is charged with carrying out the law, like all those detectives in our science fiction films. The father of Justice is Law. There is also Justice’s sister who stands guard with her at the gate of Night – and this sister – Kinsley says, is the creator of laws.  We go into the dreams, or other realms, to encounter justice and laws in order to bring them back into the conscious world – to reinvigorate the laws in our worlds.</p>



<p>Kingsley writes: “The goddess Justice opens the way to justice. It’s through encountering Justice in another world, another state of consciousness, that you’re able to bring justice into this.</p>



<h2>A dream origin of myth the reminds me of the limits of computation.</h2>



<p>It also reminds me of set theory, and Godel’s incompleteness theorem, and how the rules for the system are always outside the system. It reminds me of turing’s oracle machine, a catch all for those things that cannot be addressed by a decision matrix. </p>



<h2>My Mind is Crowded</h2>



<p>I was in the airport with my beloved on my way to Montreal. I told her my mind was crowded and she told me to draw my mind. </p>

<p>This is a move into the unconscious into the dream world to pull out the patterns. The law looks like a pattern not like a decision tree – a list of steps. The law looks like jazz. </p>



<p>I asked ChatGPT to make me a map from this image:. </p>

<p>and then a map for a video game</p>

<p>I asked chat GPT to maybe turn my drawing into a sprite map I could use with pygame</p>

<p>This is not really a sprite map -but it is kind of amazing – and creepy. </p>



<p><strong>What would the rules of this video game be</strong>?</p>



<p>How can we make rules to make us more human and more free and less like steps in an algorithm?</p>
