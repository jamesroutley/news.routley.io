  <p>A common pattern for building static sites on GitHub Pages (or similar) is to just trigger a new build every time there’s a change in the repository. This is very straightforward and well-tested, and works until you want to also trigger builds when something changes <em>outside</em> the repo. Then you run into some issues — but the solution, which took me some time to hunt down, turns out to be simple. The trick is specifying the right <code>ref</code> in your build workflow, and I explain why below.</p>

<p>In my case, there’s a <code>build-and-deploy</code> workflow that’s triggered on every new push to <code>main</code>. Then there’s also a <code>fetch-new-data</code> workflow that runs on a cron schedule and checks an external data source for updates. (Conveniently, <a href="https://parkerhiggins.net/2025/05/google-sheets-database-for-projects/">that external data source can be a Google Sheet</a>.) If there is new data, it’s formatted correctly and committed to the right place in the repo.</p>

<p>At first I thought that would be the whole story, because the new commit would automatically kick off a new build process. That didn’t happen. It turns out GitHub Actions has a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow">(reasonable!) security feature</a> that prevents tasks performed using the repository’s <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> from setting off new workflow runs, in order to prevent accidental infinite loops. My <code>fetch-new-data</code> workflow included a very default set-up of <a href="https://github.com/actions/checkout">the <code>actions/checkout</code> Action</a>, which uses that default repository token, so I was affected.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, there are two approaches to fixing this. One would be to reconfigure the <code>fetch-new-data</code> workflow to <em>not</em> use the default token. Generate a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens">personal access token</a> with the appropriate permissions, and tell the <code>checkout</code> action to use that instead. I didn’t go that route, but I think that’s what <a href="https://masteringlaravel.io/daily/2024-11-20-have-one-github-action-trigger-another">this tutorial describes</a>.</p>

<p>I opted instead to have the <code>fetch-new-data</code> workflow explicitly call the <code>build-and-deploy</code> workflow if there was a change. I <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows">reconfigured the <code>build-and-deploy</code> workflow to be reusable</a> with an <code>on: workflow_call:</code>, added the <code>uses</code> block to my calling workflow, and sat back and waited for it to work.</p>

<p>Once again, it did not. I could get it to trigger the build step, but the deployed site did not reflect the latest change. How annoying! I thought maybe it was some kind of race condition where the new commit hadn’t fully propagated, or there was some kind of caching involved. I tried a lot of silly and complicated things to address those two perceived problem areas.</p>

<p>As it turns out, I was close, and the answer is simple. In my case, the <code>build-and-deploy</code> workflow was also using a very default set-up of the <code>checkout</code> Action. If you don’t provide an explicit <code>ref</code> there, it falls back to whatever the current <code>GITHUB_SHA</code> value is. In the case of a <code>workflow_dispatch</code>/<code>workflow_call</code> setup, the called workflow <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_call">uses the <code>GITHUB_SHA</code> of the calling workflow</a>. The calling workflow, in turn, uses the <code>ref</code> of the state of the repo when it ran, which did not include the commit it performed.</p>

<p>So the fix was to set an explicit value for <code>ref</code> in the <code>checkout</code> step of the called workflow. I think hard-coding <code>main</code> probably works in almost all cases, but <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/accessing-contextual-information-about-workflow-runs#github-context">I used <code>github.ref_name</code></a> for just a touch more class.</p>

<p>I’m using this in two places now. One is in the repo for this very site, where a script that fetches my most recent movies, books, and concerts from various data sources can update a file here that gets incorporated into a Jekyll include. That info is now on my home page, but the “embed” here should also be live data, which is fun.</p>

<div>
    <div><h3>Recently watched</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Network</em> (1976)</li><li><em>Shall We Dance?</em> (1996)</li><li><em>The Phoenician Scheme</em> (2025)</li>
    </ul></div>
    <div><h3>Recently read</h3>
    <ul>

        <li>Goose at Westville Music Bowl</li><li>Matthew Evan Taylor and Metropolis Ensemble at Brooklyn Botanical Garden</li><li>Eggy at Wonder Bar</li>
    </ul></div>
</div>

<p>The data sources for those are my Letterboxd account’s RSS feed, my Goodreads account’s RSS feed, and a Google Doc of concerts that I maintain, but it’s neat to know that I could easily point the script somewhere else if I ever wanted to move away from those sites.</p>

<p>The other is on <a href="https://malaikahanda.com/">Malaika’s personal site</a>, where changes in her spreadsheet trigger new builds with updated calendar data.</p>

<p>Writing this out, I realize that there are a zillion ways to solve this problem. Most of them I discarded not because they wouldn’t work, but because they felt inelegant. I could’ve just used a personal access token, but that felt dicey on the least privilege principle. I could’ve just copied and pasted the build workflow steps into the fetch workflow, but that felt like it was unnecessarily repetitive. I’m happy to have landed on a solution where everything works like it feels like it should.</p>
