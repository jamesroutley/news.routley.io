    <h1>Ask HN: How to Price a Product</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m 11 years experienced software engineer. I have been showing interests in frontend design and development and my day job is around it.</p><p>I built a working concept that converts designs to interactive code. However, the tech is not usable at this stage, no documentation and looks bad, but works as expected.</p><p>I&#39;m aware of selling services as SAAS. I&#39;d like to sell the tech as a product containing a software, product manual, usage instructions with samples.</p><p>The target users are designers, initial feedbacks were some points to address and they are curious and interested.</p><p>Having said that it&#39;s not SAAS, not subscription based, I&#39;d like to know how to put a price on it as a product.</p></div></div></div>
