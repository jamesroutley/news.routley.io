<blockquote cite="https://grumpy.website/1389"><p>Why is nobody excited about these “yesterday”/“2 days ago”/“a week ago” labels?</p><p>Because they pretend to speak human language, but they actually don’t. For a human, yesterday is “at the day before”, “between 0am..11:59pm the day before today”.</p><p>No human uses “less that 24 hours” as the definition of “yesterday”. Computers, unfortunately, do. Add here that different implementations calculate “yesterday” differently (even on the same service) → lack of trust → less useful.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anything longer ago than yesterday should just say the actual date. It’s absurd that I sometimes need to subtract 9 or 12 days, and “borrow” from the previous month, to figure out when something actually happened. (Sometimes it’s in the tooltip or URL slug, but not always.)</p>
<p>I don’t find relative times particularly useful, either, because some sites will reload-in-place to keep them up-to-date, but others won’t. So “1 hour ago” could mean <em>actually</em> one hour ago or it could mean “one hour before I opened that tab.”</p>
