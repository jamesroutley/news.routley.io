    <h1>Anything longer ago than yesterday should just say the actual date</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Why is nobody excited about these “yesterday”/“2 days ago”/“a week ago” labels?</p><p>Because they pretend to speak human language, but they actually don’t. For a human, yesterday is “at the day before”, “between 0am..11:59pm the day before today”.</p><p>No human uses “less that 24 hours” as the definition of “yesterday”. Computers, unfortunately, do. Add here that different implementations calculate “yesterday” differently (even on the same service) → lack of trust → less useful.</p><p>And don’t get me started on “12 days ago”. This is complete bullshit. No human thinks in terms of “5+ days ago”. Last week—maybe. But not this.</p><p>(don’t use “last week/month/year”, too — it becomes too vague. Use specific day)</p><p>Thanks syL for the pictures</p></div></div>
