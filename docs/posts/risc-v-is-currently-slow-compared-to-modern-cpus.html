    <h1>RISC-V is currently slow compared to modern CPUs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After watching the rise of ARM displace Intel from most of my personal and server computing, I&#39;ve been following the RISC-V architecture with intense interest. It&#39;s an exciting open-source ISA that has the potential to reshape the CPU landscape, but there&#39;s an important caveat: <strong>RISC-V is currently quite slow compared to modern CPUs in 2024</strong>. It is even slow compared to Raspberry PI boards.</p>
<h2>How Slow is RISC-V?</h2>
<p>You can start with these Geekbench performance scores for various RISC-V processors: <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=RISC-V">https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=RISC-V</a>.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t seen any single threaded scores above 150 and no multi-threaded scores higher than 1500. The best result I&#39;ve seen is the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/6945146">Sophgo Mango</a>&#39;s score of 147 single threaded and 1300 multi-threaded. And the average score for RISC-V CPUs in Geekbench is around 80 single threaded and 400 multi-threaded.</p>
<p>In comparison, <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8224953">Apple&#39;s M4</a> series is seeing scores around 3800 single-threaded and 15000 multi-threaded. A more fair comparison would be the Raspberry Pi series of CPUs, but even then it isn&#39;t close. The <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8448431">Raspberry Pi 5</a> scores around 1000 single-threaded and 2200 multi-threaded, while the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/8443919">Raspberry Pi 4</a> scores 300 single-threaded and 739 multi-threaded.</p>
<p>So in that context, the fastest RISC-V CPU I could find is 25x slower than a top-of-the-line Apple M-series chip and ~7x slower than a Raspberry Pi 5 and 2x slower than a Raspberry Pi 4 for single-threaded performance. Those that say that RISC-V is a viable replacement for x86 or ARM in the near term are kidding themselves.</p>
<h2>Why Is RISC-V So Slow?</h2>
<p>RISC-V implementations in the wild lack advanced features that modern CPUs rely on for speed, including sophisticated pipelining mechanisms, out-of-order execution capabilities, advanced branch prediction, and multi-tiered cache hierarchies. Most commercial RISC-V chips remain in-order processors, meaning they execute instructions sequentially rather than optimizing their order for performance. This architectural simplicity creates a fundamental performance ceiling that&#39;s difficult to overcome without significant architectural changes.</p>
<h2>RISC-V is Great for Embedded Systems</h2>
<p>But even with slow performance, RISC-V is gaining significant traction in <strong>embedded applications</strong> where <strong>performance isn&#39;t the primary concern</strong>. In these contexts, cost and power efficiency are mort important than raw speed. A great example is Espressif&#39;s SoC lineup, which has largely moved to RISC-V. They demonstrate that RISC-V is ideal for IoT devices and other embedded systems where low power consumption is critical.</p>
<h2>Current Path to High Performance</h2>
<p>Several initiatives are working to address RISC-V&#39;s performance limitations. The <a href="https://github.com/riscv-boom/riscv-boom">Berkeley SonicBOOM</a> project has developed an experimental core featuring out-of-order execution and more advanced architectural features, though it hasn&#39;t yet reached mainstream usage. Similarly, <a href="https://tenstorrent.com">Tenstorrent</a>, a company founded by legendary chip designer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Keller_(engineer)">Jim Keller</a> (known for his work on AMD&#39;s Zen architecture), is working on high-performance RISC-V processors. While we haven&#39;t yet seen these chips in mainstream benchmarks, Tenstorrent&#39;s involvement suggests serious effort toward making RISC-V competitive in high-performance computing.</p>
<h2>ARM&#39;s Path as a Historical Reference</h2>
<p>ARM&#39;s trajectory provides an interesting context for understanding RISC-V&#39;s current position. ARM began in low-power embedded systems, initially facing similar performance limitations. Through years of architectural improvements and ecosystem development, ARM gradually expanded into mobile devices, then servers, and now even high-performance desktop systems. Today, ARM&#39;s success has contributed to Intel&#39;s market plateau, demonstrating how an initially limited architecture can evolve to challenge established players. However, it&#39;s important to note that this evolution took decades of sustained development and investment.</p>
<p>Looking at today&#39;s landscape, if you&#39;re building something that needs raw performance, RISC-V simply isn&#39;t ready. While there are promising developments in research labs and startups, the current generation of commercially available RISC-V processors remains significantly behind modern x86 and ARM implementations in terms of raw computational power.</p>
