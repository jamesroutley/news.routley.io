    <h1>What has a 1 in a million chance? (2010)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><h2>What really has a 1 in a million chance?</h2>
This is part of a topic that&#39;s fun to do in class. 
First I ask students
<p>
<i>If you overheard the phrase &#34;1 in a million chance&#34; in someone else&#39;s casual
conversation, what might they be talking about?</i></p><p>
and students typically offer both iconic examples 
(winning the lottery, struck by lightning)  and more imaginative suggestions. 
Then I ask 
</p><p>
<i> How could we get data on actual casual usage of the phrase 
&#34;1 in a million chance&#34;?</i></p>
and neither the students nor I can think of anything much more practical than <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Real-World/blogs.html">searching in blogs</a>, 
so I show those results.
Finally I ask for suggestions for 
<i>events that we can convince ourselves really do have a 1 in a million chance</i> 
(up to a factor of 2, let&#39;s say).
Then I go through the students&#39; suggestions; 
can we quantify the chances, and (if so) are they around 1 in a million?

<h2>Examples and nonexamples</h2>
The &#34;bullets&#34; are the examples, 
with <b>YES</b> or <b>NO</b> 
indicating whether the &#34;1 in a million&#34; chance estimate is reasonable,
 or whether the chance is substantially larger or smaller.
<p>
Let&#39;s first dispose of obvious examples from games of chance or sampling

</p><ul>
<li> 20 coin tosses (by me) all coming up Tails. <b>YES</b> 

</li><li> Winning the current 
<a href="http://www.calottery.com/play/draw-games/powerball/how-to-play">
California State Powerball lotto game</a>  if you buy 6 tickets a week for a year. <b>YES</b> 

</li><li> Specify six famous people; getting one of these people on the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">Wikipedia
&#34;random article&#34; link</a>. 
<b>YES</b>
</li></ul>
If <i>you</i> tossed the coins then the first answer would be <b>NO</b>, unless I&#39;m very confident 
you lack the
ability to fool me â€¦
<p>
One interesting local example is
</p><ul> 
<li>A major earthquake on the Hayward fault in the next 50 minutes.  <b>YES</b> </li></ul>

<b>Comment:</b> 

<a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1437/">A 2007 estimate</a> puts the chance of
a major (&gt; 6.7 magnitude) earthquake on the Hayward fault at about 1% per year. 
Since my classroom is a few hundred yards from the faultline and classes are often
50 minutes, the numbers work out nicely!  </SPAN>
