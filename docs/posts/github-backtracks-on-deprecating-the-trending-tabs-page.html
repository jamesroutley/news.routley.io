        <p dir="auto">Hey folks - Martin from GitHub here.</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks for all the feedback on the Trending page. Given the feedback here, itâ€™s clear we need to look again at the plan to deprecate this. The team is going to re-evaluate and see if we can come up with some other options. Weâ€™ll get back to you before the end of the month.  In the meantime weâ€™ll take the deprecation warning off the page until we have a clearer idea of what the long term plan is.</p>
<p dir="auto">For some background, from all our telemetry, usage of the Trending page has been very low since it was created and usage has stagnated, despite more and more people using GitHub. The number of people starring projects and following or sponsoring developers from the page is even lower.  The data pipeline that powers the page has historically proven problematic to maintain and so given the low usage, we decided to switch off the Trending page.</p>
<p dir="auto">But given the feedback from everyone here, itâ€™s clearly a much loved feature by the people that do use it.  We really want to make sure everyone can discover new projects and learn about awesome maintainers in the future. We are going to see if we have any better options or if we can provide similar functionality in a different way.</p>
<p dir="auto">We will get back to you all in a few weeks once we have a firm idea what the long term plan is for the Trending page.  Thanks again for all the comments and feedback - explaining what it is that you value about the Trending page was particularly helpful, so thanks for those comments in particular <g-emoji alias="sparkling_heart" fallback-src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f496.png">ðŸ’–</g-emoji></p>
