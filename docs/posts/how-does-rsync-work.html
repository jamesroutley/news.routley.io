  <p>This post is the third article in a series of blog posts about rsync, <a href="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2022-06-18-rsync-overview/">see the
Series Overview</a>.</p>
<p>With rsync up and running, it’s time to take a peek under the hood of rsync to
better understand how it works.</p>
<h2 id="howdoesrsyncwork">How does rsync work?</h2>
<p>When talking about the rsync protocol, we need to distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li>protocol-level roles: “sender” and “receiver”</li>
<li>TCP roles: “client” and “server”</li>
</ul>
<p>All roles can be mixed and matched: both rsync clients (or servers!) can
either send or receive.</p>
<p>Now that you know the terminology, let’s take a high-level look at the rsync
protocol. We’ll look at protocol version 27, which is older but simpler, and
which is the most widely supported protocol version, implemented by <code>openrsync</code>
and other third-party implementations:</p>
<p><img src="https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2022-07-02-rsync-how-does-it-work/2022-05-29-rsync-logical-view.svg" alt="rsync architecture"/></p>
<p>The rsync protocol can be divided into two phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the first phase, the sender walks the local file tree to generate and send
the <em>file list</em> to the receiver. The file list must be transferred in full,
because both sides sort it by filename (later rsync protocol versions
eliminate this synchronous sorting step).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second phase, concurrently:</p>
<ul>
<li>The receiver compares and requests each file in the file list. The
receiver requests the full file when it didn’t exist on disk yet, or it
will send checksums for the rsync <em>hash search</em> algorithm when the file
already existed.</li>
<li>The receiver receives file data from the sender. The sender answers the
requests with just enough data to reconstruct the current file contents
based on what’s already on the receiver.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The architecture makes it easy to implement the second phase in 3 separate
processes, each of which sending to the network as fast as possible using heavy
pipelining. This results in utilizing the available hardware resources (I/O,
CPU, network) on sender and receiver to the fullest.</p>
<h3 id="observing-rsyncs-transfer-phases">Observing rsync’s transfer phases</h3>
<p>When starting an rsync transfer, looking at the resource usage of both
machines allows us to confirm our understanding of the rsync architecture, and
to pin-point any bottlenecks:</p>

<li>phase: The rsync sender needs 17 seconds to walk the file system and send
the file list. The rsync receiver reads from the network and writes into RAM
during that time.
<ul>
<li>This phase is random I/O (querying file system metadata) for the sender.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>phase: Afterwards, the rsync sender reads from disk and sends to the
network. The rsync receiver receives from the network and writes to disk.
<ul>
<li>The receiver does roughly the same amount of random I/O as the sender did
in phase 1, as it needs to create directories and request missing files.</li>
<li>The sender does sequential disk reads and possibly checksum calculation, if
the file(s) existed on the receiver side.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(Again, the above was captured using rsync protocol version 27, later rsync
protocol versions don’t synchronize after completing phase 1, but instead
interleave the phases more.)</p>
<h3 id="rsync-hash-search">rsync hash search</h3>
<p>Up until now, we have described the rsync protocol at a high level. Let’s zoom
into the hash search step, which is what many people might associate with the
term “rsync algorithm”.</p>
<p>When a file exists on both sides, rsync sender and receiver, the receiver first
divides the file into blocks. The block size is a rounded square root of the
file’s length. The receiver then sends the checksums of all blocks to the
sender. In response, the sender finds matching blocks in the file and sends only
the data needed to reconstruct the file on the receiver side.</p>
<p>Specifically, the sender goes through <strong>each byte</strong> of the file and tries to
match existing receiver content. To make this less computationally expensive,
rsync combines two checksums.</p>
<p>rsync first calculates what it calls the
<a href="https://github.com/WayneD/rsync/blob/0ac7ebceef70417355f25daf9e2fd94e84c49749/checksum.c#L182-L203">“sum1”</a>,
or “fast signature”. This is a small checksum (two <code>uint16</code>) that can be
calculated with minimal effort for a rolling window over the file data. tridge
rsync comes with <a href="https://github.com/WayneD/rsync/blob/v3.2.4/simd-checksum-x86_64.cpp">SIMD
implementations</a>
to further speed this up where possible.</p>
<p>Only if the sum1 matches will
<a href="https://github.com/WayneD/rsync/blob/0ac7ebceef70417355f25daf9e2fd94e84c49749/checksum.c#L205-L300">“sum2”</a>
(or “strong signature”) be calculated, a 16-byte MD4 hash. Newer protocol
versions allow negotiating the hash algorithm and support the much faster xxhash
algorithms.</p>
<p>If sum2 matches, the block is considered equal on both sides.</p>
<p>Hence, the best case for rsync is when a file has either not changed at all, or
shares as many full blocks of content as possible with the old contents.</p>
<h2 id="changing-data-sets">Changing data sets</h2>
<p>Now that we know how rsync works on the file level, let’s take a step back to
the data set level.</p>
<p>The easiest situation is when you transfer a data set that is not currently
changing. But what happens when the data set changes while your rsync transfer
is running? Here are two examples.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Debian/debiman">debiman</a>, the manpage generator powering
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org/">manpages.debian.org</a> is running on a Debian VM on
which an rsync job periodically transfers the static manpage archive to
different static web servers across the world. The rsync job and debiman are
not sequenced in any way. Instead, debiman is careful to only ever <a href="https://github.com/Debian/debiman/blob/79b8abe8573daaaf15e4cf40e85daf309e00d454/internal/write/atomically.go#L23">atomically
swap out
files</a>
in its output directory, or add new files before it swaps out an updated index.</p>
<p>The second example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL">PostgreSQL</a>
database management system, is the opposite situation: instead of having full
control over how files are laid out, here I don’t have control over how files
are written (this generalizes to any situation where the model of only ever
replacing files is not feasible). The data files which my Postgres installation
keeps on disk are not great to synchronize using rsync: they are large and
frequently change. Instead, I now exempt them from my rsync transfer and use <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/pg_dump.1"><code>pg_dump(1)</code></a>
 to create a snapshot of my databases instead.</p>
<p>To confirm rsync’s behavior regarding changing data sets in detail, I <a href="#confirmation-hack">modified
rsync to ask for confirmation</a> between generating the file
list and transferring the files. Here’s what I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>If files are added after rsync has transferred the file list, the new files
will just not be part of the transfer.</li>
<li>If a file vanishes between generating the file list and transfering the file,
rsync exits with status code 24, which <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/bullseye/rsync/rsync.1.en.html#EXIT_VALUES">its manpage documents as “Partial
transfer due to vanished source
files”</a>. My
<code>rsyncprom</code> monitoring wrapper <a href="https://github.com/stapelberg/rsyncprom/commit/bbf82934093b938d054d460a7f9764234d30bc17">offers a flag to treat exit code 24 like exit
code
0</a>,
because depending on the data set, vanishing files are expected.</li>
<li>If a file’s contents change (no matter whether the file grows, shrinks, or is
modified in-place) between generating the file list and the actual file
transfer, that’s not a problem — rsync will transfer the file contents as it
reads them once the transfer starts. Note that this might be an inconsistent
view of the data, depending on the application.
<ul>
<li>Ideally, don’t ever modify files within a data set that is rsynced. Instead,
atomically move complete files into the data set.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way of phrasing the above is that data consistency is not something that
rsync can in any way guarantee. It’s up to you to either live with the
inconsistency (often a good-enough strategy!), or to add an extra step that
ensures the data set you feed to rsync is consistent.</p>
