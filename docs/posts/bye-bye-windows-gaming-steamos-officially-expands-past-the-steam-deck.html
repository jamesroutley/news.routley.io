    <h1>Bye-bye Windows gaming? SteamOS officially expands past the Steam Deck</h1>

          <p>Almost exactly a year ago, we were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">publicly yearning</a> for the day when more portable gaming PC makers could ditch Windows in favor of SteamOS (without having to resort to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-linux-coders-turning-the-rog-ally-and-other-handhelds-into-steam-deck-clones/">touchy unofficial workarounds</a>). Now, that day has finally come, with Lenovo <a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/lenovo-legion-unleashes-next-gen-gaming-power-at-ces-2025/">announcing</a> the upcoming Legion Go S as the first non-Valve handheld to come with an officially licensed copy of SteamOS preinstalled. And Valve promises that it will soon ship a beta version of SteamOS for users to &#34;download and test themselves.&#34;</p>
<p>As Lenovo&#39;s slightly downsized followup to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/lenovo-legion-go-suggests-gaming-portables-arent-big-enough-need-a-mouse/">2023&#39;s massive Legion Go</a>, the Legion Go S won&#39;t feature the detachable controllers of its predecessor. But the new PC gaming handheld will come in two distinct versions, one with the now-standard Windows 11 installation and another edition that&#39;s the first to sport the (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-return-of-steam-machines-valve-rolls-out-new-powered-by-steamos-branding/">recently leaked</a>) &#34;Powered by SteamOS&#34; branding.</p>
<p>The lack of a Windows license seems to contribute to a lower starting cost for the &#34;Powered by SteamOS&#34; edition of the Legion Go S, which will start at $500 when it&#39;s made available in May. Lenovo says the Windows edition of the device—available starting this month—will start at $730, with &#34;additional configurations&#34; available in May starting as low as $600.</p>

<p>Both the Windows and SteamOS versions of the Legion Go S will weigh in at 1.61 lbs with an 8-inch 1200p 120 Hz LCD screen, up to 32GB of RAM, and either AMD&#39;s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/amds-new-ryzen-z2-cpus-boost-gaming-handhelds-if-you-buy-the-best-one/">new Ryzen Z2 Go chipset</a> or an older Z1 core.</p>
<h2>Watch out, Windows?</h2>
<p>Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/529834914570306831">said in a blog post on Tuesday</a> that the Legion Go S will sport the same version of SteamOS currently found on the Steam Deck. The company&#39;s work getting SteamOS onto the Legion Go S will also &#34;improve compatibility with other handhelds,&#34; Valve said, and the company &#34;is working on SteamOS support for more devices in the future.&#34;</p>
