    <h1>So you want to speak at software conferences?</h1>

						<p>I run a <a href="https://ldnug.org/">.NET user group here in London</a>, and we host a lot of talks from people who are relatively inexperienced presenters. Sometimes they’ve done presentations internally but never spoken before a public audience. Sometimes they’re developers who have been in theatre or played in bands; people with plenty of stage experience but who haven’t presented on technical topics before - and sometimes they’ve never done any kind of public presentations or performance at all. We aim to be a friendly, supportive crowd; public speaking can be daunting, and the first public outing of somebody’s first talk can be… let’s just say that the presenter sometimes learns a lot more than the audience, and leave it at that.</p>

<p>But it can also be a hugely rewarding experience, and as a seasoned tech presenter who’s been doing this for a while, aspiring speakers often ask me for advice on how to take it to the next level.</p>

<p>Before we get into the specifics, there are two things to bear in mind.</p>

<p>One: ask yourself why you want to do this. What does “the next level” mean for you? Are you looking to promote your consultancy, or your training courses, or your software products? Do you want to become a professional speaker and actually get paid to give talks? Are you doing it ‘cos you want to go places and meet people? Figure out what “success” looks like for you.</p>

<p>Two: be realistic about how much work is involved. It took me <em>seven years</em> to go from my first user group lightning talk, back 2008, to my first international conference. If you think you can hack together some code, write a talk about it, stick it on Sessionize and three months later you’re on your way to a major international event like NDC or Yow! or Devoxx… well, no. That’s not how this works. Strap in; it’s a long ride.</p>

<h3 id="year-1-get-good">Year 1: Get Good</h3>

<p>Write the talk. Write a talk nobody else could do; tell a story nobody else can tell. Figure out what your audience is going to learn, and why you’re the best person to teach them that. Then give it at local user group. It might go great. It might be a train wreck. Don’t worry. That’s one of the reasons user groups exist. Learn from the experience. Fix the demos. Fix the slides. If it was too short? Write some more. If it was too long? Cut something. Give it at another user group. Do it again. Do it again. Maybe write a second talk, shop that one around a couple of user groups too.</p>

<p>If you can’t find user groups, look on Meetup.com. Yes, it’s a horrible platform, but it works; search by topic, search by region, find groups that look like a good match for your content, and ask if they’re looking for speakers. They probably are.</p>

<h3 id="year-2-get-seen">Year 2: Get Seen</h3>

<p>After user groups and meetups come the community conferences. Typically small, one-day events, with a few tracks, and usually free (or very cheap) to attend. For me, these were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer!\_Developer!\_Developer!#External\_links">the DDD events</a> _(that’s DDD as in Developers! Developers! Developers!, not to be confused with DDD as in Domain Driven Design), _a series of one-day free developer events around the UK, organised by volunteers, usually on a Saturday so people don’t have to take time off work. They bring in a good crowd, they’re a great way to get to know other presenters and people who are involved in tech events, and you’ll almost certainly meet a few people who are on the programme committees for the bigger conferences.</p>

<p>Events like this are your chance to get noticed. Turn up the day before, join the pre-conference dinner and drinks, introduce yourself. Yeah, it’s awkward when you don’t know anybody. There will be other people there who don’t know anybody and will appreciate you making the effort. Enjoy yourself, but don’t end up doing tequila shots in a karaoke bar at 3am. Not now. You’re there to give a talk, remember?</p>

<p>Go to the event. Spend the whole day there, do your talk, watch the other sessions. Communicate with the organisers. You don’t want their memorable impression of you to be a half-hour of panic and missed calls because one of their speakers has gone AWOL and nobody knows where they are.</p>

<p>Figure out how to keep in touch with the people you met. Join the Signal or WhatsApp group chat; if there isn’t one, create one. Follow them on LinkedIn, or Bluesky - be prepared to go where people are; don’t expect folks to join Mastodon just because that’s where you want to talk to them. That’s not how this works. If you really don’t want to play the social media game - and I can’t blame you - there’s always good old-fashioned email. A short email a week later saying “hey, thanks for having me” or “hey, I loved your session at DDD, let’s keep in touch” can pay off in a big way.</p>

<p>Finally, watch out for events that put video of their sessions online. Having a couple of YouTube links of you doing your thing in front of a live, appreciate audience can make all the difference when a programme committee is looking at a handful of talks and can only accept one of them.</p>

<h3 id="year-3-get-accepted">Year 3: Get Accepted</h3>

<p>You’ve got a couple of talks. You’ve delivered then enough times that you know they’re good *(and if they’re not good, make them good - or scrap them and write new ones)*. You know people. People know you. If somebody asks “hey, do we know anybody who could do a good session about $topic”, your name comes up. You’ve got a decent network of connections - group chats, LinkedIn, email addresses.</p>

<p>Now, find all the conferences in your field with an open Call for Papers (CfP), and get submitting. Dave Aronson over at codeasaur.us maintains a really useful <a href="https://www.codosaur.us/speaking/cfps-ending-soon">list of CfPs which are closing soon</a>. Check that regularly. Many events will cover your travel &amp; hotel costs, although with sponsorship budgets drying up right across the industry that’s not as prevalent as it was a few years ago. If not, maybe you can persuade your employer to pay your travel - “hey, boss, if I can get a free ticket to this amazing conference with all these industry experts, do you think the company will pay my air fare &amp; hotel?”</p>

<p>Lean on your network. What are people submitting to? Which events should you look out for? Which topics are getting a lot of traction (and which topics are not?)</p>

<p>Keep your content fresh. Write new talks. Keep giving them at user groups and community events.</p>

<p>Keep your submissions focused. 2-3 talks per event; don’t submit ten wildly different abstracts to the same conference in the hope one of them will get accepted. Every selection committee I’ve been on, if we see that, we assume the presenter hasn’t actually written *any* of them yet and is throwing everything they can think of into the mix and hoping one of them gets chosen. Not a great way to stand out. An open CFP at a big tech conference typically gets 20+ submissions for every available slot, which means if you reduce it to a numbers game, you’re submitting 20 talks for every one that gets accepted. Keep track of the numbers, and be objective about it.</p>

<h3 id="year-4-get-bored">Year 4: Get Bored.</h3>

<p>It’s great fun doing this for a while… but it’s also exhausting. Some people hit it hard for a few years, do all the things, go to all the places, make a lot of great friends and happy memories, and then wake up one day and decide that’s enough. Some people do a few talks, tick it off their bucket list and decide that’s enough for them. Some settle into a gentle routine of 3-4 events they’ll do every year. And yes, some of us end up treating our calendars like a game of Tetris, juggling flights and trains and hotels and meetups and conferences and spending half the year on the road and the other half writing talks and workshops and all the other things it’s hard to do when you’re at the airport.</p>

<p>That’s why you gotta figure out ahead of time what “success” looks like. If you’re doing it for fun, remember to have fun - and if you find you’re not enjoying it any more? Stop. If you’re doing it as promotion or marketing? Track your leads. Make sure it’s actually generating the attention and the revenue it’s supposed to. If you’re doing it for money, be mercenary: no pay, no play. Not every event is the same, of course. In a given year I’ll have some events that are fun, some that are lucrative, some that are running alongside workshops or training engagements. Just make sure you know which is which.</p>

<p>Finally: respect your audience. Whether you’re talking to five people at a meetup, fifty at a community event, or five thousand at a huge international conference: those people are the reason you get to do this. They have given up their time - and often a substantial amount of money - to hear what you have to say. They deserve your best shot, every time. If you find you’re bored, fed up, tired, running talks on autopilot or making mistakes because you just don’t care? It’s time to try something else - and remember, there’s a thousand aspiring speakers out there who would dearly love to take that spot instead of you.</p>

<p>Now get out there. Work hard, have fun, teach us awesome things, and if you ever want me to look over an abstract or a slide deck, drop me a line - <a href="https://dylanbeattie.net/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#42263b2e232c02263b2e232c20272336362b276c2c2736"><span data-cfemail="52362b3e333c12362b3e333c30373326263b377c3c3726">[email protected]</span></a>. I’d be happy to help.</p>
