            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We released Zulip Server 5.6 today! This is a security release, containing an important security fix and several cherry-picked changes since Zulip Server 5.5.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading">Upgrading</h2>
<p>We recommend that all installations upgrade to this new release. See the <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release">upgrade instructions</a> in the Zulip documentation. If you need help, best-effort support is available on <a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">chat.zulip.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="notable-changes">Notable changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where an attacker who can send messages could trick the server into embedding a link that violates Zulip’s security model.
<ul>
<li>This fixes a security vulnerability (CVE-2022-36048): When displaying messages with embedded remote images, Zulip normally loads the image preview via a go-camo proxy server. However, an attacker who can send messages could include a crafted URL that tricks the server into embedding a remote image reference directly. This could allow the attacker to infer the viewer’s IP address and browser fingerprinting information.</li>
<li>This fix also protects against a vulnerability in the Zulip mobile app (CVE-2022-35962), discussed in detail below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added hardening against timing attacks to an internal authentication check.</li>
<li>Improved documentation for hosting multiple organizations on a server.</li>
<li>Updated dependencies.</li>
<li>Updated translations.</li>
</ul>
<p>CVE-2022-36048 was discovered internally by the Zulip team.</p>
<h2 id="zulip-mobile-v27190-security-release">Zulip Mobile v27.190 security release</h2>
<p>Users of the Zulip mobile apps should upgrade to v27.190, which was released simultaneously with this Zulip Server release. This mobile release fixes a security issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>CVE-2022-35962: An attacker who can send messages could craft a malformed image link which, if tapped in the Zulip mobile apps, could disclose the recipient’s Zulip credentials.</li>
</ul>
<p>CVE-2022-35962 was discovered internally by the Zulip team. We have performed a complete audit, and determined that this vulnerability has never been exploited in Zulip Cloud. The vulnerability is present in all previous mobile releases.</p>
<p>As discussed above, upgrading to Zulip Server 5.6 also protects against CVE-2022-35962, even for users running older versions of Zulip Mobile. Zulip Cloud has also been upgraded to protect against this vulnerability.</p>
