    <h1>My Favorite Math Problem</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Having studied quite a bit of math, I have done a ton of problems. And when you do enough of anything, you develop a taste for things. I love good problems. I also enjoy sharing them with people. There is one I find particularly good — actually, in many ways, it&#39;s the best one I know.</p> <!-- --> <p>The statement is quite simple: Consider a normal chessboard. Produce a<!-- --> <em>mutilated chessboard</em> by removing two opposing diagonal corner squares (illustrated below).</p> <!-- --> <p><img src="https://bytesauna.com/boards/normal_board.png" alt="A normal chessboard" width="200"/> <img src="https://bytesauna.com/boards/eliminated_board.png" alt="A mutilated chessboard" width="200"/></p> <!-- --> <p>Now, it&#39;s clear that a normal chessboard can be covered by 2x1 blocks. The question then is the following: <strong>Can a mutilated chessboard be covered using (exactly 31) 2x1 blocks?</strong></p> <!-- --> <p><img src="https://bytesauna.com/boards/normal_board_block.png" alt="A normal chessboard with a block" width="200"/> <img src="https://bytesauna.com/boards/eliminated_board_block.png" alt="A mutilated chessboard with two blocks" width="200"/></p> <!-- --> <p>Just to clarify further: This is a yes or no question. The question is not<!-- --> <em>how</em> the mutilated chessboard can be covered; the question is <em>if this can be done at all</em>. Clearly, one way to answer the question in the affirmative is to actually produce a covering: If a covering were successfully produced, then yes, of course, a covering exists. The point is, though, that an argument that either proves the <em>existence</em> of a covering or a <em>nonexistence</em> of any covering is enough,</p> <!-- --> <p><em>Canonical solution below:</em></p> <!-- -->  <!-- --> <p>Now, why do I like this problem so much? Well, for one, it&#39;s simple. You could explain this to a 7-year-old, and they would probably get the gist of it. And even though it&#39;s simple, it&#39;s very difficult. This is subjective, of course, but I find that this is common with these kinds of combinatorial problems. They are easy to state, the solutions are easy to understand — and yet, coming up with the solution on your own is often extremely hard.</p> <!-- --> <p>There is, however, a wider context where this problem fits quite well. I think this problem is a way to deliver a pinch of &#34;higher mathematics&#34; in an approachable way. While this is an elementary setting, this illustrates how questions of <em>existence</em> come into play. This is the core: Advanced mathematics is often not about constructing something directly via a calculation or an algorithm, but showing the <em>existence</em> of something. And when you deal with existence, you start to deal with <strong>definitions</strong> and <strong>proofs</strong>.</p> <!-- --> <p>Abstract definitions and proofs about the objects governed by those definitions are interesting in many ways. They can be highly creative, and this is where, I think, math can be compared to art. In particular, understanding and producing definitions and proofs seems to require human intelligence. Amazingly, though, we are right now living a moment where computers are starting to perform in this area.</p> <!-- --> <p>Modern mathematics is extremely abstract. I would say the shift started somewhere around the late 19th century when Cantor produced breakthrough results in set theory (such as<!-- --> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_first_set_theory_article">this</a> <!-- -->famous one). Now that this has been going on for a century or two, we are so far down the path of abstraction that at first glance it seems hopeless for a computer to tackle any of this. A fundamental<!-- --> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence">fact</a>, however, is that proofs can be seen as <strong>types</strong>. Types, on the other hand, are ubiquitous in programming languages. This turns out to be a direction that enables formulation of mathematical theory in a form that computer understands. Microsoft has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/lean/">a project</a> related to the type systems of programming languages. In the hands of mathematicians, it has grown into <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html">a project</a> with the lofty goal of formalizing our mathematical knowledge into a computer-readable form. While still highly experimental, this system has already<!-- --> <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/blog/posts/lte-final/">proven</a> itself in serious research.</p> <!-- --> <p>Then there is AI.</p> <!-- --> <p>As LLMs can produce any kind of text or code, they can equally well attempt to produce type-theoretic formulations of mathematical statements. Terence Tao, one of the leading mathematicians of our time,<!-- --> <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2025/11/05/mathematical-exploration-and-discovery-at-scale/">wrote</a> <!-- -->about recent developments in this area.</p> <!-- --> <p>I feel like something big is happening right now, and it may not be long before mathematical research looks very different from what it does today.</p> </div></div>
