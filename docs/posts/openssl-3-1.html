    <h1>OpenSSL 3.1</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We are pleased to announce that the forthcoming OpenSSL 3.1 release is to be
made available on 14th March 2023.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>OpenSSL 3.1 is mostly a small increment over the functionality available in
OpenSSL 3.0. The main changes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A FIPS 140-3 compliant FIPS Provider.</p>

    <p>The FIPS provider has been upgraded to be FIPS 140-3 compliant. We are working
with our FIPS lab to submit our FIPS 140-3 validation to CMVP based on the
3.1.0 release. It is likely to be quite some time before any validation
certificate is issued due to the CMVP waiting times for this. Note that it is
possible to upgrade to 3.1 to gain the performance improvements below, and
still use the 3.0 FIPS provider.</p>

    <p>There are a number of changes to the FIPS provider that have been required in
order to achieve this compliance. The most significant ones are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some algorithms are included in the provider but are no longer approved for
use. These include Triple DES ECB, Triple DES CBC and EdDSA. For backwards
compatibility reasons they remain in the FIPS provider but are marked with the
<code>fips=no</code> property query. This means that all applications requiring FIPS
compliance should explicitly specify <code>fips=yes</code> even if they only have the FIPS
provider loaded (typically either via config or by using the
<code>EVP_default_properties_enable_fips()</code> function)</li>
      <li>The self tests are now run every time the module is loaded - rather than
when the module is installed. Due to a streamlining in the self test process
by NIST, these tests run considerably faster than they do in the 3.0 FIPS
provider.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Numerous performance improvements</p>

    <p>There have been numerous performance improvements implemented compared to the
OpenSSL 3.0 release.</p>

    <p>Particular highlights include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Refactoring of the <code>OSSL_LIB_CTX</code> code to avoid excessive locking</li>
      <li>Performance improvements in the encoder and decoder frameworks</li>
      <li>Performance fixes to internal data structures and caching (e.g. hash
structures, IV caching)</li>
      <li>Improved FIPS RSA keygen performance</li>
      <li>Various assembler optimisations to a number of different algorithms (e.g.
AES-GCM, ChaCha20, SM3, SM4, SM4-GCM) across multiple processor
architectures</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
