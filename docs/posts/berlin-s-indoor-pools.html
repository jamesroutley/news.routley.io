    <h1>Berlin&#39;s indoor pools</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><article><div><p>The German capital is dotted with more than 60 public indoor swimming pools, and many of them are so stunning and tranquil they feel like you&#39;re swimming in an ornate library.</p><div><div><p>O</p><div><div><p>On a recent November day in Berlin&#39;s upscale Prenzlauer Berg neighbourhood, locals in long jackets pushed strollers through the crisp autumn air. Others wrapped themselves in blankets and lingered at outdoor cafes. And down the street, a handful of people gripping swimsuits headed under the stone Neo-Renaissance facade at the <a href="https://www.hotel-oderberger.berlin/" target="_blank">Hotel Oderberger Berlin</a> to partake in a beloved, centuries-old local tradition: whiling away the hours at one of Berlin&#39;s many eye-catching public indoor swimming pools (Hallenbäder).</p>
<p>Boasting <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1337751/indoor-swimming-pools-cities-germany/" target="_blank">60 indoor public swimming pools</a> that attract six million visitors each year, Berlin is one of the world&#39;s great indoor swimming destinations. And unlike elsewhere, where public pools are more functional than fancy, Berlin&#39;s Hallenbäder are veritable cathedrals of late 19th- and early 20th-Century design.</p>
<p>As I followed the crowd inside the <a href="https://www.hotel-oderberger.berlin/bad/" target="_blank">Stadtbad Oderberger Strasse</a>, for instance, I noticed the 20m pool was surrounded by decorative tiles, arched windows and ornate detailing on the stone railings that felt more like a Moroccan riad than a public pool. Berlin&#39;s indoor pools are also known for being places of relaxation rather than racket. Aside from the occasional splash or sandals tapping against tiles, all was quiet here. As others were quietly doing laps, it felt like I was in a library-turned-swimming pool (without the constant fear of getting shushed).</p>
<p>&#34;It would be impossible not to be fond of swimming and also live in a place like Berlin,&#34; said local resident Beata Gontarczyk-Krampe. &#34;It&#39;s something that you do very much and very often in Berlin.&#34;</p>
<p>For the past 15 years, Gontarczyk-Krampe, who calls herself &#34;a very eager amateur historian&#34; has been researching and writing about Berlin&#39;s lesser-known history, publishing two editions of her <a href="https://kreuzberged.com/notmsparkers-berlin-companion-or-i-didnt-know-that-about-berlin/" target="_blank">Berlin Companion</a> books in the process. The history of Berlin&#39;s many indoor swimming pools is a topic that&#39;s piqued her interest since moving to here from Poland in 2003. And after spending the past 20 years discovering dozens of ornate Hallenbäder hiding in plain sight, she learned that they have a curious history.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div id="travel/article/20231116-the-hidden-beauty-of-berlins-indoor-pools-p0gsy3wc"><div><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gsy3wc.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gsy3wc.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gsy3wc.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gsy3wc.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gsy3wc.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gsy3wc.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gsy3wc.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gsy3wc.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Berlin is filled with indoor pools – many of which are architectural gems dating to the late 1800s, like Baerwaldbad (Credit: imageBROKER.com GmbH &amp; Co.

KG/Alamy)</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>Hallenbäder first became popular in Berlin among the wealthier classes in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries as a means to develop higher standards of personal hygiene at a time when few people had baths at home. But as it became clear that poor hygiene spread diseases, the city realised that there were civic and sanitary benefits to broadening the pools&#39; accessibility and granted access to lower classes as well, which is why they are also called Volksbäder, or the &#34;people&#39;s pools&#34;.</p>
<p>Remarkably, many of the city&#39;s Hallenbäder survived the bombing of World War Two. <a href="https://www.berlinerbaeder.de/baeder/stadtbad-charlottenburg-alte-halle/?utm_source=google-my-business&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=content-api" target="_blank">Stadtbad Charlottenburg</a> – the city&#39;s oldest indoor pool built between 1896 and 1898 – and Stadtbad Oderberger Strasse are two such examples. But those that were hit, like Stadtbad Moabit, were swiftly restored to their original glory.</p>
<p>&#34;The city did everything it could to re-open them as quickly as possible,&#34; Gontarczyk-Krampe explained. &#34;But not so much for swimming as for washing and bathing.&#34;</p>
<p>After World War Two, a trip to the pool became less about hygiene and more as an escape from the rubble of an occupied city. These ornate reminders of a better time were the backdrop for many Berliner childhoods. For those children of post-war Germany, spending the afternoon at the pool simply became a matter of tradition, if not obsession.</p>
<p>&#34;Berliners are really among the most swimming-pool crazy people I know,&#34; Gontarczyk-Krampe laughed. Just as hordes of Berliners flock to the city&#39;s many <a href="https://www.visitberlin.de/en/blog/top-11-lakes-swimming-berlin" target="_blank">nearby lakes</a> to swim whenever the weather warms, they also retreat to their local pool as soon as temperatures drop.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div id="travel/article/20231116-the-hidden-beauty-of-berlins-indoor-pools-p0gsy403"><div><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gsy403.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0gsy403.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gsy403.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0gsy403.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gsy403.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gsy403.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gsy403.webp" type="image/webp"/><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0gsy403.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Berlin&#39;s public pools range from Art Nouveau to Brutalist to East German-era prefabricated styles, like Stadtbad Märkisches Viertel (Credit: dpa picture alliance/Alamy)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0gsy403.jpg" alt="Berlin&#39;s public pools range from Art Nouveau to Brutalist to East German-era prefabricated styles, like Stadtbad Märkisches Viertel (Credit: dpa picture alliance/Alamy)" id=""/></picture><div><p>Berlin&#39;s public pools range from Art Nouveau to Brutalist to East German-era prefabricated styles, like Stadtbad Märkisches Viertel (Credit: dpa picture alliance/Alamy)</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>&#34;Most of the Hallenbäder are surprisingly full very early in the morning,&#34; she said. &#34;All lanes will be taken by the &#39;Frühschwimmer&#39; or early swimmers.&#34; Then there are the weekends, when parents carry massive bags full of snacks and swim gear.</p>
<p>&#34;If you really wanted to hurt Berliners, you would take the swimming pools away,&#34; Gontarczyk-Krampe joked. &#34;Whenever anyone says anything about a swimming pool being renovated or closed for three years, there&#39;s such an outcry. It&#39;s almost touching.&#34;</p>

<p>After years of serving different purposes – including being under American control post-World War Two – the pool opened its doors to the public in 2014. The vast hall, adorned with floor-to-ceiling windows, preserves its original scale and aesthetics, with pastel blue and white ceilings adding a touch of vibrancy. Despite its challenging past, the pool now offers a unique blend of history and modern amenities, including a free book exchange, inviting visitors to reflect on its transformative journey. Either way, come prepared to swim, as it&#39;s known as a place for sporty swimmers.</p>
