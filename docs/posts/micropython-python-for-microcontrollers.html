        MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the
        <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python 3</a> programming language
        that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is
        optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MicroPython <a href="https://micropython.org/pyboard">pyboard</a> is a compact electronic
        circuit board that runs MicroPython on the bare metal, giving you a low-level
        Python operating system that can be used to control all kinds of electronic
        projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        MicroPython is packed full of advanced features such as an interactive
        prompt, arbitrary precision integers, closures, list comprehension,
        generators, exception handling and more.  Yet it is compact enough to fit and
        run within just 256k of code space and 16k of RAM.
      </p>
      <p>
        MicroPython aims to be as compatible with normal Python as possible to
        allow you to transfer code with ease from the desktop to a microcontroller
        or embedded system.

    MicroPython is a full Python compiler and runtime that runs on the bare-metal.
    You get an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands immediately,
    along with the ability to run and import scripts from the built-in filesystem.
    The REPL has history, tab completion, auto-indent and paste mode for a great
    user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
    MicroPython strives to be as compatible as possible with normal Python (known
    as CPython) so that if you know Python you already know MicroPython.  On the
    other hand, the more you learn about MicroPython the better you become at Python.
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition to implementing a selection of core Python libraries, MicroPython
    includes modules such as &#34;machine&#34; for accessing low-level hardware.

    MicroPython is written in C99 and the entire MicroPython core is
    available for general use under the very liberal
    <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/LICENSE">MIT license</a>.
    Most libraries and extension modules (some of which are from a third party) are
    also available under MIT or similar licenses.
    </p>
    <p>
    You can freely use and adapt MicroPython for personal use, in education, and
    in commercial products.
    </p>
    <p>
    MicroPython is developed in the open on GitHub and the source code is available
    at <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython">the GitHub page</a>,
    and on the <a href="https://micropython.org/download">download page</a>.
    Everyone is welcome to contribute to the project.

    MicroPython employs many advanced coding techniques, and lots of tricks
    to maintain a compact size while still having a full set of features.
    </p>
    <p>
    Some of the more notable items are:
    </p><ul>
      <li> highly configurable due to many compile-time configuration options </li>
      <li> support for many architectures (x86, x86-64, ARM, ARM Thumb, Xtensa)</li>
      <li> extensive <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/tests">test suite</a> with over 590 tests, and more than 18,500 individual testcases </li>
      <li> code coverage at 98.4% for the core and <a href="https://coveralls.io/github/micropython/micropython">at 96.3%</a> for the core plus extended modules </li>
      <li> fast start-up time from boot to loading of first script (150 microseconds to get to boot.py, on PYBv1.1 running at 168MHz) </li>
      <li> a simple, fast and robust mark-sweep garbage collector for heap memory </li>
      <li> a MemoryError exception is raised if the heap is exhausted </li>
      <li> a RuntimeError exception is raised if the stack limit is reached </li>
      <li> support for running Python code on a hard interrupt with minimal latency </li>
      <li> errors have a backtrace and report the line number of the source code </li>
      <li> constant folding in the parser/compiler </li>
      <li> <a href="https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/py/mpconfig.h#L51-L95">pointer tagging</a> to fit small integers, strings and objects in a machine word </li>
      <li> transparent transition from small integers to big integers </li>
      <li> support for 64-bit NaN boxing object model </li>
      <li> support for 30-bit stuffed floats, which don&#39;t require heap memory  </li>
      <li> a cross-compiler and frozen bytecode, to have pre-compiled scripts that don&#39;t take any RAM (except for any dynamic objects they create) </li>
      <li> multithreading via the &#34;_thread&#34; module, with an optional global-interpreter-lock (still work in progress, only available on selected ports) </li>
      <li> a native emitter that targets machine code directly rather than the bytecode virtual machine</li>
      <li> inline assembler (currently Thumb and Xtensa instruction sets only) </li>
    </ul>
