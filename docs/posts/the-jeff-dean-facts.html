    <h1>The Jeff Dean Facts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">

<p dir="auto">The &#34;Jeff Dean facts&#34; are a set of jokes that revolve around the extraordinary programming prowess of their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Dean" rel="nofollow">titular Google employee</a>. Simply put, they are the coding equivalent of Chuck Norris-style jokes (for example, &#34;Chuck Norris can slam a revolving door&#34;).</p>
<p dir="auto">I first encountered the Facts on a random Quora page, though as of recently many of them appear to have been removed. Thus, in order to preserve this invaluable cache of programmer humor for posterity, I decided to create this repository. It is a combined list of various versions of the Facts, beginning with a text file that I copied from the Quora post sometime in 2019, when the original answer still existed. It&#39;s been expanded from other sources, which are listed (and linked, if possible) at the end of this document.</p>

<p dir="auto">This list was compiled from several sources, with duplicate (or near-duplicate) Facts removed. The relevant sources are:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Quora - the original question seems to still exist, at <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-the-Jeff-Dean-facts" rel="nofollow">https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-the-Jeff-Dean-facts</a>, but the exact response I downloaded all those years ago is nowhere to be found.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.informatika.bg" rel="nofollow">infO(N)</a>, a Bulgarian website that appears to provide schedules and results for coding competitions (<a href="https://www.informatika.bg/jeffdean" rel="nofollow">post</a>)</li>
<li>A <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KentonVarda/posts/TSDhe5CvaFe" rel="nofollow">now-deleted Google+ thread</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/45g4he/comment/d001vav" rel="nofollow">quoted</a> by a Reddit user</li>
</ul>

<ol dir="auto">
<li>It&#39;s not clear whether this fact is <em>really</em> true, or whether this line is simply part of the joke, so I&#39;ve omitted the usual <code>(TRUE)</code> identifier here. Interpret this as you see fit :)</li>
