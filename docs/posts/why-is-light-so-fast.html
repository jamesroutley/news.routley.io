					<p>The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant; it is said to be conserved over time, however it further states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed – only converted from one form of energy to another. In other words Energy and mass have always existed, so yo cannot create something out of nothing but from the available mass and energy that has always existed. To my thinking and agreeable to Principles of Relativity, that even the so called vacuum of space or the so called ether is a form or energy or mass (so far unexplained as dark matter) as it has always existed, even if in another form (call it dark matter). As a theologian, I see the Wavicles as (organized power) from an intelligent being, that passes through all energy and mass under two laws. 1) To GOVERN His creatures, according to immutable laws (elements that are given shape, image and mass and which eventually will be converted to another (energy/mass) within a higher sphere/dominion/principality/dimension or realm. 2) To CONTROL the lower (non intelligent elements that make up mass as dust, plants, gas, planets, stars quasars, Pulsars etc, according to laws.</p>

					<p>On this: “even the so called vacuum of space or the so called ether is a form or energy or mass (so far unexplained as dark matter) as it has always existed, even if in another form (call it dark matter).” I think you might want to read the book’s Chapters 1-8 carefully.  Things — objects — are not forms of energy.  Energy is carried <strong>by</strong> things.  The same is true of mass.  If you imagine making things out of energy or out of mass, you are misunderstanding what energy and mass are.  They are properties of substances, not the ingredients for substances.  Do not let loose language lead you astray on this.</p>
<p>Also, I’d like to ask you again to please hold your religious theorizing from this blog, particularly when it veers into scientific speculation with no experimental basis (as in “within a higher sphere/dominion…” or “Nucleus of all nuclei”.)  I’d encourage you to write about these ideas on a blog devoted to the larger questions of truth, philosophy, religion, metaphysics, and the like. This is a site devoted to the very limited methods and lessons of science.  </p>
<p>In science, we assume there are laws of nature and do experiments to understand what follows from those assumptions.  Remarkably, what we learn proves to be very powerful in the practical, material world. But we cannot use these methods to definitively address larger questions of truth, religion, fundamental origins, etc.  </p>
<p>You can try to obtain answers for such questions as you see fit, but these are not scientific answers, as they require assumptions beyond those that are necessary to do science.  You’re welcome to make those assumptions, of course. But the consequences of those assumptions are not scientific, and belong on a different blog than this one.  Here we walk a narrow, straight path, knowing that sticking to that path means that we can answer a few questions with great clarity, while leaving other important questions, including ones essential to being human, completely unaddressed.</p>

					<p>In GR, conservation laws are a little bit more complex.</p>
<p>At first, it was not clear how conservation of energy applied to GR, and that gave way to the discussions and debate of Hilbert, Klein, Einstein and Noether about this topic.</p>
<p>It was Noether who made this topic crystal-clear.</p>
