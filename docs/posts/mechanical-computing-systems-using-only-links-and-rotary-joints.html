      <span>Abstract:</span>  A new model for mechanical computing is demonstrated that requires only two
basic parts: links and rotary joints. These basic parts are combined into two
main higher level structures: locks and balances, which suffice to create all
necessary combinatorial and sequential logic required for a Turing-complete
computational system. While working systems have yet to be implemented using
this new approach, the mechanical simplicity of the systems described may lend
themselves better to, e.g., microfabrication, than previous mechanical
computing designs. Additionally, simulations indicate that if molecular-scale
implementations could be realized, they would be far more energy-efficient than
conventional electronic computers.
