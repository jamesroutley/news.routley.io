    <h1>Connecting a gaming PC to Apple Studio Display</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article><h2 id="you-re-right-it-shouldn-t-be-this-hard">You’re right, it shouldn’t be this hard</h2><p>I’ll never forget when I bought the first <a href="https://everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/specs/imac-core-i5-3.5-27-inch-aluminum-retina-5k-late-2014-specs.html">5K Retina
iMac</a>.
Almost as soon as I ripped it out of the box, I booted it while holding down
<code>Command-F2</code>, assuming it would support <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204592">Target Display
Mode</a>, with the intention of using its
one-of-a-kind display with my gaming PC. I was heartbroken when Mac OS X booted
anyway and I slowly realized that Target Display Mode hadn’t survived the
transition to retina resolutions. And it never came back, either. (I haven’t
really been happy with <a href="https://usesthis.com/interviews/justin.searls/">my
setup</a> ever since.)</p><p>Well, here we are, 8 years later and Apple has introduced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/studio-display/">5K Studio
Display</a>. I ordered one the minute that
they hit the store in the hope I would receive what I thought I had purchased in
2014: a single 5K Apple display that could drive both a Mac and a PC desktop.
(Nevermind the fact that it’s <em>damn near the exact same panel</em> that I bought 8
years ago.) When my Studio Display arrived, I tore it out of its
environmentally-friendly origami box and excitedly plugged it into one of my
<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3090/">Nvidia RTX
3090</a>’s
DisplayPorts with a DisplayPort-to-USB-C cable.</p><p>I booted up the PC: <a href="https://twitter.com/searls/status/1505161234529890306?s=20&amp;t=fCF-5Pzce6KV03jCDop5HQ">nothing
happened</a>.</p><p>I spent the better part of the weekend
figuring out how to drive this display in Windows on a non-Mac computer and
in this post, I’ll do my best to share what I learned.</p><p>There are two sides to this, the physical connection between your devices and
the software drivers needed. We’ll cover both in turn.</p><h2 id="hardware-connecting-the-display-to-your-pc">Hardware: connecting the display to your PC</h2><p>The headline here is: if your computer has a Thunderbolt 3 or 4 port, you’re in
luck, because that’s the only input port on the Studio Display.</p><p>Unfortunately, vanishingly few desktop gaming PCs have any Thunderbolt support.
And even if your machine happens to include a Thunderbolt port, it’s unlikely to
be able to route frames from your discrete graphics card, which would defeat the
purpose of connecting it to your Studio Display to play games.</p><p>I attempted three different physical configurations of varying complexity,
feature support, and (ultimately) success. I’ll detail them here in the order I
tried them.</p><h3 id="method-1-an-8k-displayport-1-4-cable">Method 1: an “8K” DisplayPort 1.4 cable</h3><p>If you just want to use the display and don’t care about the speakers, microphone,
or USB-C ports, then by far the simplest solution is to just plug a
high-bandwidth DisplayPort cable with a USB-C connector or adapter from your GPU
to the Studio Display’s Thunderbolt port. No Thunderbolt cable is actually
needed, as the display will happily handshake DisplayPort 1.4 alt mode when
connected with a high-bandwidth cable.</p><p>If, like me, you’ve done this and still don’t see anything on the display,
quadruple-check your cable. When I initially <a href="https://twitter.com/searls/status/1505161234529890306">suggested that this didn’t work on
Twitter</a>, I was under the
mistaken impression that I had been using an appropriately high-bandwidth cable,
when in reality my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J6DT070">cable’s Amazon
page</a> was a recycled ASIN and the
<em>actual</em> cable I purchased in 2018 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20181105094256/https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-DisplayPort-USB-C-Supporting/dp/B01J6DT070">was a lower-bandwidth 4K
version</a>.
(Naturally, both versions of this cable look identical and are not labeled.)</p><p>So that one’s easy. No software install necessary, no extra hardware needed. The
downside is you’ll need to bring your own speakers and won’t be able to use any
of the display’s other features. If that’s all you need, stop reading now and
just buy the right cable.</p><h3 id="method-2-bidirectional-displayport">Method 2: Bidirectional DisplayPort</h3><p><strong>[Warning: I don’t think this method actually works, but don’t let me stop you
from trying]</strong></p><p>Several folks on Twitter pointed me to <a href="https://ntk.me/2021/10/12/pro-display-xdr-on-windows-pc/">this post on connecting the Pro Display
XDR to a Windows
machine</a>. In it, the
author points out that it’s possible to connect a USB-C cable to the display,
then have a <a href="https://www.belkin.com/us/support-article?articleNum=316883">hard-to-find VR
cable</a> or a
<a href="https://estore.wacom.com/en-US/wacom-link-plus-dongle.html">similarly obscure Wacom tablet
accessory</a> actively
split the signal and serve as a USB 2.0 controller. This, in turn, apparently
allows you to control brightness from the Boot Camp control panel.</p><p>Amazingly, this approach almost works with the Studio Display. I couldn’t find
the Belkin cable, but I had fun playing Twister trying to plug everything into
this Wacom breakout box:</p><p><img src="https://justin.searls.co/media/studio_display/ports-on-ports.jpg" alt="Wacom Link"/></p><p>Unfortunately, it quickly became clear that there isn’t nearly enough
bandwidth (likely in the USB-C cable, but possibly in the break-out box’s USB
controller) to support the features present on the Studio Display but absent
from the Pro Display XDR (speakers, camera, microphone, etc.)</p><p>After plugging everything in, I was delighted to hear some audio and to see the
various onboard devices show up in Device Manager. Unfortunately, the audio
suffered pretty severe distortions, microphone levels were detected but
inaudible, and the USB ports didn’t seem to work. Clearly this isn’t the easy
solution it apparently is for Pro Display XDR users.</p><h3 id="method-3-pcie-thunderbolt-expansion-card">Method 3: PCIe Thunderbolt expansion card</h3><p>If your goal is to use your Studio Display’s speakers, microphone, and USB-C
ports in addition to driving pixels, a Thunderbolt expansion card is your best
bet.</p><p>Specifically, the <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GC-TITAN-RIDGE-rev-20#kf">Gigabyte GC-Titan Ridge 2.0 Thunderbolt 3 PCIe
card</a>. This
clever design uses a short PCIe slot and, remarkably, worked for me on the very
first try.</p><p>Prerequisite hardware:</p><ul><li>An open PCIe slot</li><li>Two 6-pin PCIe power cables from your power supply</li><li>An open USB header on your motherboard (if you want to use speakers,
microphone, or the three USB-C ports at USB 2.0 speeds)</li><li>A Thunderbolt 3 cable</li></ul><p>The device expects to be plugged into either a 3-pin or 5-pin Thunderbolt
header on your motherboard as well, but my board lacks either. I ended up
plugging in the provided 5-pin cable to the card and left the other end
disconnected and it happened to work fine (YMMV though, per the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BC11XW8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1#customerReviews">Amazon
reviews</a>,
some users report having to short two of the pins to get it to work).</p><p>Install:</p><ol><li>Slot the card into your motherboard</li><li>Connect the two 6-pin power cables</li><li>Connect the card to a free USB header on your motherboard using the included
cable</li><li>(If your board has one) connect the appropriate Thunderbolt header with the
included cable (it’ll be either the 3-pin or the 5-pin, not both)</li><li>Outside the case, connect the two (included) DisplayPort-to-Mini DisplayPort
cables from the first two DisplayPorts on your GPU to the two available mini
DisplayPorts on the Titan Ridge card (this looks, and totally is, silly)</li><li>Connect Thunderbolt Port 1 on the card to your Studio Display</li></ol><p>The back of your computer will probably look like this, with two DisplayPorts
crossing over to Mini DisplayPorts on the Titan Ridge card and the Thunderbolt 3
cable connecting out to the Apple Studio Display:</p><p><img src="https://justin.searls.co/media/studio_display/cables.jpg" alt="GPU and PCIe"/></p><p>With any luck, the display will immediately be recognized by Windows as a
“Generic PnP Monitor”, though you may need to install Boot Camp drivers first.</p><p>Ultimately, this configuration has very few downsides: speakers, microphone, and
USB-C ports all work at 2.0 speeds. (I didn’t try the display’s terrible
webcam.) I’m pretty happy with this outcome. The display even appears in the
Boot Camp control panel and the brightness slider works:</p><p><img src="https://justin.searls.co/media/studio_display/studio-display-pref.png" alt="Brightness controls!"/></p><p>Still, it’s not without its quirks. For example, the USB controller is only
recognized about 30 seconds after Windows boots, which means that any
applications that start up at boot (like the MS Edge rendering engine,
apparently) won’t be correctly associated with the Studio Display speakers until
they’re quit and relaunched.</p><h2 id="software-installing-boot-camp-onto-non-mac-hardware">Software: installing Boot Camp onto non-Mac hardware</h2><p>If you’ve never tried to install Boot Camp drivers onto a non-Mac, it’s not
particularly easy. I won’t detail everything I had to do here, but I’ll at least
point to the resources that showed me what I needed.</p><ol><li>To download the Boot Camp installer, I ran the
<a href="https://github.com/timsutton/brigadier">brigadier</a> Python script after
installing Python 2.7 and indicating my computer was a 2019 Mac Pro with:
<code>c:\python27\python .\brigadier --model MacPro7,1</code></li><li>From the resulting directory (and ensuring the command prompt was running as
an Administrator), I bypassed the installer’s hardware checks by running
<code>msiexec /i BootCamp\Drivers\Apple\BootCamp.msi</code></li><li>At the time of this writing (March 21st, 2022), this will only install Boot
Camp 6.1.0, but 6.1.17 is the first version with support for the Studio
Display. If you’ve come this far and features on your Studio Display still
aren’t working, you can do what I did and <a href="https://qiita.com/kmatsuura/items/30b84af032688eccf2c4">follow this guide to look up the
individual BootCamp update executables from an XML
catalog</a>, then
decompress them and pull the associated driver INF files from it, manually
installing stuff via Device Manager until things work</li></ol><p>I spent so much time installing, re-installing, and troubleshooting my BootCamp
installation that I’m not at all sure how much, if any, was actually necessary
to get this working, so if you arrive at a simpler solution, I’d love to <a href="mailto:justin@searls.co">hear
about it</a>.</p><h2 id="it-shouldn-t-be-this-hard">It shouldn’t be this hard</h2><p>Apple clearly doesn’t care much about supporting its products in Windows on its
<em>own</em> computers, so I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised that getting this
display working on a non-Mac PCs was a two day project in its own right. As a
result, I’m on the fence as to whether I should keep swimming against the
current with this and just return the Studio Display. I don’t love my <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34WK95U-W-ultrawide-monitor">LG 5k2k
ultrawide Thunderbolt 3
monitor</a> but at
least it’s reliable in its mediocrity.</p><p>Hopefully this guide helps a few wayward souls figure out how to make the Studio
Display fit their needs. Did this work for you? I’d love to hear about your
experience with this <a href="https://twitter.com/searls">on Twitter</a>!</p><hr/><p><time pubdate="" datetime="2022-03-20">2022.03.20</time></p></article></div></div>
