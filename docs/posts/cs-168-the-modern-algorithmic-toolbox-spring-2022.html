<ul>
<li><b>Lecture 19 (Wed 6/1):</b>
Differential Privacy in data analysis and machine learning.
<ul>
<li>
We won&#39;t have the usual lecture notes for this lecture, though the first chapter of the the Dwork/Roth book linked below is a fantastic starting place for learning about differential privacy.
</li></ul>
Supplementary material:
<ul>
<li>A fairly recent book on Differential Privacy by Cynthia Dwork and Aaron Roth: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8187424?arnumber=8187424">here</a> (should be downloadable from stanford network).
</li><li>The <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11681878_14">original paper</a> of Dwork, McSherry, Nissim, and Smith, introducing differential privacy.
<!--<li> The 2016  paper of Papernot, Abadi, Erlingsson, Goodfellow, and Talwar, describing the "Private Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles" approach of training multiples models on subsets of the data, and using them to ``teach'' a new, private, model, by combining their predictions in a differentially private fashion: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05755.pdf">here</a>.

      <li><b>Assignments (90% of Grade)</b>: There will be 9 weekly mini-projects centered around the topics covered that week. Each mini-project contains both written and programming parts. You are strongly encouraged to work in teams of up to four students.  If you work in a team <b>only one member</b> should submit all of the relevant files.  

      

      <p>For the written part, you are encouraged to use LaTeX to typeset your homeworks;
      we&#39;ve provided a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/homework.tex">template</a> for your
      convenience. We will be using the <a href="https://gradescope.com/"> GradeScope </a> online submission system. Please create an account on Gradescope using your Stanford ID and join CS168 using entry code JBRB8N. 

<!--
You must turn in a single PDF file --
  --through <a href="https://scoryst.com/enroll/0jj4i6sNNK/">Scoryst</a>. 
-->
</p>

      <p>For the programming part, you are encouraged to use matlab (<a href="http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/matlab/">tutorial</a>), Numpy and Pyplot in Python (<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html">Python tutorial</a>, <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">Numpy tutorial</a>, <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/">Matplotlib tutorial</a>), or some other scientific computing tool (with plotting). <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/blob/master/python-colab.ipynb">Here</a> is a comprehensive python tutorial using Google&#39;s colab that was put together for the CS231n course, with examples of plotting using matplotlib at the very end.
<!--
	<p>To turn in your programming part:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Compress all your files into a .zip file, such
            as <code>p1.zip</code>.

<li>See the instructions on the mini-project for details about what files to
            submit.  For example, we generally want your code in addition
            to your answers.
</li>
            <li>Copy the zip file to the cardinal machine (don't miss the colon in the end):
scp <zip file> <your SUNetID>@cardinal.stanford.edu:
      </pre></li>
            <li>Log onto the cardinal machine:
<pre>
ssh <your SUNetID>cardinal.stanford.edu
</pre></li>
            <li>Run the submit script (run the script without any argument to see its usage):

<pre>
/usr/class/cs168/WWW/submit.py <project ID> .
</pre></li>
Note: your file must have the proper name (such as <code>p1.zip</code>) for the submit script to process it.

        </ol>
      <p>You can submit multiple times; each submission will just replace the previous one.</p>
-->
      </p><p>Assignments are released on Mondays, and are due at 11:59pm on Tuesdays the following week (both the written and the programming parts). <b>No late assignments will be accepted</b>, but we will drop your lowest assignment grade when calculating your final grade.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Final Project (10% of Grade)</b>:  You can turn the project in at any point up until the last lecture of the quarter, and can work in a team of at most four students.  This project should take one of two forms:
<ul> <li>Option 1) Design an alternate miniproject for one topic.  Choose one of the weeks in the course, and think about the high-level take-home messages from that week.  Craft a miniproject that explores some of those take-home messages.  The miniproject you design should have the same sort of ``feel&#39;&#39; and length as the other miniprojects for the course.  If your miniproject involves a dataset, please include a clear link to that dataset (google drive/dropbox/etc is fine) and description of what that dataset is.  Please also include a sample-solution for the miniproject, together with a short (ie 1 or 2 paragraph) discussion/reflection on how the miniproject complements and/or reinforces the material for that week.   </li></ul>
<ul> <li>Option 2) Dive deeper into one of the topics we&#39;ve covered.  Choose a week or even a single lecture, and explore how these ideas have been extended beyond the material covered in lecture.  What are some of the newer applications of these ideas?  How have the ideas been optimized/tweaked? Where is the current research frontier in this direction?  See where your curiosity takes you, and then in a short (3-10 page) paper, present/discuss what you learned.  Your paper can resemble a survey/research paper, or lecture notes.  </li></ul>      </li><li><b>Contributions to the 168 Community (Discretionary Grade Bumps)</b>: You are encouraged to help your fellow classmates when possible.  This includes responding to Piazza questions  when you know the answer, helping improve the course lecture notes by pointing out typos/errors/confusing parts, etc. [there will be a special Piazza folder specifically for providing this feedback on the lecture notes].  At the end of the course, I will bump up grades of those students who had the most positive impact on the 168 community, according to the (quite subjective) judgement of the TAs and me.
    </li></ul>
    

<p>You can discuss the problems at a high level with other groups and contact the course staff (via Ed or office hours) for additional help.  And of course, you are encouraged to help respond to Ed questions .</p>

<p>You may refer to the course notes and research papers linked from the course webpage, and can also use other references that you find online.  You may *NOT* consult solution sets or code from past offerings of this course.  Services such as CourseHero are strictly forbidden, and if you try to sell my lecture notes or your solution sets to these sites, a well-paid lawyer representing Stanford will be in contact with you : )  [Please don&#39;t do this!]  Of course, you are expected to understand everything that is written on any assignment turned in with your name; if you do refer to references, make sure you cite them appropriately, and make
  sure that all your words are your own.</p>

<p>
You are also permitted to use general resources for whatever programming
language you choose to use.  None of the assignments require you to write much code, and *you may NOT reuse any code from friends/internet sources related to previous offerings of this course*.  If you use helper functions or code snippets that you did not write yourself (aside from standard python packages, etc.)  you must clearly cite the source in your writeup.
