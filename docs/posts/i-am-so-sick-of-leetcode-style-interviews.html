    <h1>I Am So Sick of Leetcode-Style Interviews</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>I quit my previous job at <a href="https://robinhood.com/?ref=nelson.cloud" target="_blank">Robinhood</a>
in late November of 2023 mainly for health reasons. I’ve been in various interviews since then. Things have fallen off for one reason or another but I just gotta say…I am getting so tired of <a href="https://leetcode.com/problemset/?ref=nelson.cloud" target="_blank">Leetcode</a>
-style interviews. Especially since I know for a fact they don’t reflect the actual responsibilities of a software engineering of a job.</p><p>It seems like most (if not all) companies do these kinds of interviews simply because that’s what all the big companies do, like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and so on.</p><p>I’ve had some very bright engineers tell me that I shouldn’t memorize things that I can easily google. But yet, these interviews quiz me on things that I can easily Google that I may not know off the top of my head. It’s absurd.</p><p>I don’t really have a solution to this problem, I just know it’s a problem.</p><p>And I’m sick of it.</p><p>If you need a Software Engineer with AWS, Kuberentes, and Ruby on Rails experience, and you don’t do silly quizzes, feel free to reach out!</p></div></article></div></div>
