<p>A Seattle CEO who announced in 2015 that he was giving himself a drastic pay cut to help cover the cost of big raises for his employees has announced his resignation. </p><p>Dan Price, the embattled CEO of credit card processing company Gravity Payments, resigned Wednesday, The Seattle Times <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/gravity-payments-ceo-dan-price-resigns/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=owned_echobox_tw_m&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1660784128-1" rel="nofollow noopener">reported</a>. </p><p>&#34;My No. 1 priority is for our employees to work for the best company in the world, but my presence has become a distraction here,&#34; Price wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/DanPriceSeattle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement</a> posted on Twitter. He founded the company 18 years ago.</p>    
  <p>&#34;I also need to step aside from these duties to focus full time on fighting false accusations made against me,&#34; he wrote. &#34;I&#39;m not going anywhere.&#34;</p><p>Earlier this year, Seattle prosecutors charged Price with misdemeanor assault against a woman and reckless driving. Prosecutors say Price tried to forcibly kiss a woman. He pleaded not guilty in May; the case remains ongoing.</p>

    

<p>Seven years ago, Price stunned his 100-plus workers when he told them he was cutting his <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gravity-payments-where-minimun-wage-is-70000-a-year/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">roughly $1 million salary to $70,000</a></span> and using company profits to ensure that everyone there would earn at least that much within three years. That amounted to a 46% jump from Gravity Payments&#39; average annual salary at the time of $48,000. About 70 employees at the company saw raises, with 30 doubling their annual salaries.</p><figure data-require="third-party/twitter-widgets">
</figure><p>&#34;I&#39;m so happy how people&#39;s lives are changing, because they deserve it, and they deserve every penny of it,&#34; <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ceo-giving-70000-minimum-wage-says-its-a-sacrifice/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Price said in 2016</a></span>. &#34;For me to make the sacrifice in the short term, I&#39;d rather this than a vacation home in Palm Springs or the Hamptons. I guarantee that this will pay off.&#34;</p><p>Gravity Payments now pays employees a minimum wage of $80,000 per year, Price <a href="https://twitter.com/DanPriceSeattle/status/1560058738362523649" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> this week.</p><p>Price, 38, has run into other legal trouble. His brother <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brother-of-ceo-who-slashed-his-own-pay-files-suit/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">Lucas sued him in 2015</a></span>, alleging that Dan Price was overpaying himself and mismanaging the company. A King County judge ruled that Dan had not violated Lucas&#39; rights as a minority shareholder.</p><figure><div>

              </figcaption></figure><p>Allegations that Price had abused ex-wife Kristie Colon also surfaced that year. A Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-gravity-ceo-dan-price/?sref=sBMxP0gT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">report</a> recounted an October 2015 TEDx talk given by Colon during which she described being beaten and waterboarded by her ex, without naming Price. Price told Bloomberg those events &#34;never happened.&#34;</p>

    
    

<p>Chief operating officer Tammi Kroll will take over as Gravity Payments&#39; CEO. </p>
