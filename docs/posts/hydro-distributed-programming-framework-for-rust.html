    <h1>Hydro: Distributed Programming Framework for Rust</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><div><div><div><div><article><div><header></header>
<p>Hydro is a high-level distributed programming framework for Rust. Hydro can help you quickly write scalable distributed services that are correct by construction. Much like Rust helps with memory safety, Hydro helps with <a href="https://hydro.run/docs/hydro/correctness"><strong>distributed safety</strong></a>. Hydro also makes it easy to get started by running your distributed programs in either testing or deployment modes.</p>
<p>Hydro is a distributed dataflow language, powered by the high-performance single-threaded <a href="https://hydro.run/docs/dfir/">DFIR runtime</a>. Unlike traditional architectures such as actors or RPCs, Hydro offers <em>choreographic</em> APIs, where expressions and functions can describe computation that takes place across many locations. It also integrates with <a href="https://hydro.run/docs/deploy/">Hydro Deploy</a> to make it easy to deploy and run distributed Hydro programs either locally or in the cloud.</p>
<p>Hydro uses a two-stage compilation approach. Hydro programs are standard Rust programs, which first run on the developer&#39;s laptop to generate a <em>deployment plan</em>. This plan is then compiled to DFIR to generate individual binaries for each machine in the distributed system (enabling zero-overhead abstractions), which are then deployed to the cloud using the generated plan along with specifications of cloud resources.</p>
<p>Hydro has been used to write a variety of high-performance distributed systems, including implementations of classic distributed protocols such as two-phase commit and Paxos. Work is ongoing to develop a distributed systems standard library that will offer these protocols and more as reusable components.</p>
