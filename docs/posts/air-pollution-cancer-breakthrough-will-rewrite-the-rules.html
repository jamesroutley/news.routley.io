It acquires more and more mutations in its genetic code, or DNA, until it reaches a tipping point. Then it becomes a cancer and grows uncontrollably. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But there are problems with this idea: cancerous mutations are found in seemingly healthy tissue, and many substances known to cause cancer - including air pollution - <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0692-4">don&#39;t seem to damage people&#39;s DNA</a>.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="So-what-is-going-on"><span role="text">So what is going on?</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The researchers have produced evidence of a different idea. The damage is already there in our cell&#39;s DNA, picked up as we grow and age, but something needs to pull the trigger that actually makes it cancerous. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The discovery came from exploring why non-smokers get lung cancer. The overwhelming majority of lung cancers are caused by smoking but still, <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/air-pollution-radon-gas-and-cancer/how-can-air-pollution-cause-cancer">one in 10 cases in the UK is down to air pollution</a>.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Crick scientists focused on a form of pollution called particulate matter 2.5 (known as PM2.5), which is far smaller than the diameter of a human hair.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Through a series of detailed human and animal experiments they showed:</p></div><div data-component="unordered-list-block"><div><div><ul role="list"><li>Places with higher levels of air pollution had more lung cancers not caused by smoking</li><li>Breathing in PM2.5 leads to the release of a chemical alarm - interleukin-1-beta - in the lungs</li><li>This causes inflammation and activates cells in the lungs to help repair any damage</li><li>But around one in every 600,000 cells in the lungs of a 50-year-old already contains potentially cancerous mutations</li><li>These are acquired as we age but appear completely healthy until they are activated by the chemical alarm and become cancerous</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Crucially, the researchers were able to stop cancers forming in mice exposed to air pollution by using a drug that blocks the alarm signal. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The results are a double breakthrough, both for understanding the impact of air pollution and the fundamentals of how we get cancer. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Dr Emilia Lim, one of the Crick researchers, said people who had never smoked but developed lung cancer often had no idea why. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;To give them some clues about how this might work is really, really important,&#34; she said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s super-important - 99% of people in the world live in places where air pollution exceeds the WHO guidelines so it really impacts all of us.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The findings could lead to a rethink in how cancers form</p></figcaption></figure></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Rethinking-cancer"><span role="text">Rethinking cancer</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the results also showed mutations alone are not always enough to cause cancer. It can need an extra element. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prof Swanton said this was the most exciting finding his lab had come across, as it &#34;actually rethinks our understanding of how tumours are initiated&#34;. He said it would lead to a &#34;new era&#34; of molecular cancer prevention.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The idea of taking a cancer-blocking pill if you live in a heavily polluted area is not completely fanciful. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Doctors have already trialled an interleukin-1-beta drug in cardiovascular disease and found, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(17)32247-X/fulltext">by complete accident</a>, they cut the risk of lung cancer. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The latest findings are being presented to scientists at <a href="https://www.esmo.org/meetings/esmo-congress-2022">a conference of the European Society for Medical Oncology</a>.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Speaking to the BBC from the conference, Prof Swanton said: &#34;Pollution is a lovely example, but there are going to be 200 other examples of this over the next 10 years.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And he said we needed to rethink how even smoking causes cancer - is it just the known DNA damage caused by the chemicals in tobacco or is the smoke causing inflammation, too?</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Curiously, the idea that mutated DNA is not enough and cancers need another trigger to grow was first proposed by scientist <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2007559/pdf/brjcancer00406-0124.pdf">Isaac Berenblum in 1947</a>.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Philosophically, it&#39;s fascinating. These incredible biologists have done this work 75 years ago and it&#39;s largely been ignored,&#34; said Dr Lim.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, stressed that &#34;smoking remains the biggest cause of lung cancer&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But she added: &#34;Science, which takes years of painstaking work, is changing our thinking around how cancer develops. We now have a much better understanding of the driving forces behind lung cancer.&#34;</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
