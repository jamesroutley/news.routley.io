His training was in the Bauhaus school of architecture, and his interests were philosophical ideas of culture and space relating to geopolitics. War seemed like a total breakdown of both of these: a devastating force that tore through the world and left nothing standing.</p><p><span>It was enough to turn him into a self-avowed pacifist. But he wanted to go one step further: to not just deny the validity of war, but to </span><em>engineer it out of existence</em><span>. </span></p><p>In Sörgel’s view, this was an urgent matter. The future as he saw it would be dominated by three superpowers: one stretching across the Americas, another a Pan-Asian block  in the far east - and, most dangerously, a greatly weakened post-war Europe in the middle, currently unable to resist being dominated by the other two.</p><p>What was needed was a project so ludicrously ambitious, yet so immeasurably beneficial to all the European powers, that it would at last force them to put aside their differences and cooperate, if they wanted to reap the spectacular rewards on offer. </p><p><span>(And if it was expensive enough - wouldn’t that make it impossible for them to keep throwing all their money into building new armies, navies and air-forces? Wouldn’t it engineer </span><em>peace</em><span>?)</span></p><p>This is why Herman Sörgel decided it would be best for everyone if he drained the Mediterranean.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9b26316-2f31-4ff0-84a0-f300fbb74268_800x320.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9b26316-2f31-4ff0-84a0-f300fbb74268_800x320.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9b26316-2f31-4ff0-84a0-f300fbb74268_800x320.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9b26316-2f31-4ff0-84a0-f300fbb74268_800x320.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9b26316-2f31-4ff0-84a0-f300fbb74268_800x320.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9b26316-2f31-4ff0-84a0-f300fbb74268_800x320.jpeg" width="800" height="320" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a9b26316-2f31-4ff0-84a0-f300fbb74268_800x320.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:320,&#34;width&#34;:800,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:30941,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9b26316-2f31-4ff0-84a0-f300fbb74268_800x320.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9b26316-2f31-4ff0-84a0-f300fbb74268_800x320.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9b26316-2f31-4ff0-84a0-f300fbb74268_800x320.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa9b26316-2f31-4ff0-84a0-f300fbb74268_800x320.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a></figure></div><p><span>When the 1980 deep-sea thriller </span><em>Raise The Titanic!</em><span> bombed at the box office, clawing back just $7 million of its then-astonishing $40 million budget, its producer Lew Grade quipped “it would have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic.”</span></p><p><span>Okay, I laughed too.

This isn’t a mistake: for engineering reasons that appear to be lost to us, Sörgel decided the dam should be built 30 km further inside the Mediterranean - meaning it would have to be even longer than the Strait itself.</span></p><p>Once its foundations were built (2.5km wide, 300m deep) and once its entire length was laid out across the seaway, a 400-metre-high tower would be erected - all of this requiring … um, more concrete than existed in the world at that time, it seems. </p><p><span>The dam wall would have to be high enough to prevent Atlantic gales from pounding water over the top, and deep enough to reach to the seabed (anything from 300 to 900 metres deep, depending on the location). And it would have to stretch for at least </span><strong>25 kilometres</strong><span>, probably more.</span></p><p>By contrast, the largest hydroelectric dam in the world today, the Three Gorges Dam in China, is 2.3km long, 185 metres from base to top, and took 17 years to build with modern construction technology. Atlantropa’s Gibraltar dam would be on another scale entirely.</p><p>It wouldn’t just be a mammoth undertaking: it would require a collective engineering effort never before seen in human history. </p><p>(And it’d still only be the first dam of five.)</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2da3e037-a7b7-41b8-8cad-04c05c3197cb_800x420.jpeg"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2da3e037-a7b7-41b8-8cad-04c05c3197cb_800x420.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2da3e037-a7b7-41b8-8cad-04c05c3197cb_800x420.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2da3e037-a7b7-41b8-8cad-04c05c3197cb_800x420.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2da3e037-a7b7-41b8-8cad-04c05c3197cb_800x420.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2da3e037-a7b7-41b8-8cad-04c05c3197cb_800x420.jpeg" width="800" height="420" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2da3e037-a7b7-41b8-8cad-04c05c3197cb_800x420.jpeg&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:420,&#34;width&#34;:800,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:94088,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2da3e037-a7b7-41b8-8cad-04c05c3197cb_800x420.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2da3e037-a7b7-41b8-8cad-04c05c3197cb_800x420.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2da3e037-a7b7-41b8-8cad-04c05c3197cb_800x420.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2da3e037-a7b7-41b8-8cad-04c05c3197cb_800x420.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a></figure></div><p><span>Science fiction writers have a lot of fun with disasters.

In 1932 in Germany alone, Atlantropa was featured in over a hundred newspaper articles - and after long after Nazi interest in it waned (too much cooperation, not quite enough brutality), its popularity quietly endured, powered by Sörgel’s tireless support - until 1952, when he was killed while cycling to an Atlantropa lecture at a university in Munich. (This allegedly happened on a road &#34;</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080119054122/http://www.datum.at/0406/stories/1905573/" rel="">as straight as a die</a><span>&#34; and the driver of the car was never found. Make of that as you will.) </span></p><p>Atlantropa may have been wildly unfeasible for countless reasons, a perfect turducken of Nopes. (For example: hey, what would an emptying of the Mediterranean do to the world climate - and the other oceans, which is exactly where all that water would go?)</p><p>But the way that so-called “megaprojects” like this have a habit of capturing our attention and stirring us with big, grand What-Ifs - perhaps in a way that ‘every little helps’ messaging fails to do -  could the challenges of the 21st Century do with a bit of Atlantropa-style storytelling behind them? </p><p><span>I’ll leave the last word here to Cal Flyn, author of the fantastic </span><em><a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/islands-of-abandonment-life-in-the-post-human-landscape/9780008329808" rel="">Islands Of Abandonment</a></em><span>, who </span><a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/climate-change-writing-cop26-uk-cal-flyn-islands-of-abandonment-life-post-human-landscape" rel="">recently wrote for Prospect Magazine</a><span> about the need for big, stirring narratives of hope to turn our problems into solutions:</span></p><blockquote><p>“A quotation, commonly attributed to the writer and pioneering French aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, says: “If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up people together to collect wood and don’t assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.” This, if I ever read one, is a manifesto for nature writing in the present day. This is our own task: to evoke the experience of being in this wild and beautiful world. To stir people to love the planet with a jealous passion, to act in a way more befitting of a custodian or even lover. Go in through the heart, and the head will follow.</p><p><span>We need to be roused. We need to </span><em>feel</em><span>. We need a siren song that lures unsuspecting souls to the cause: a song to enchant us, to put us to work.”</span></p></blockquote><p>If “longing for the sea” is such a big part of it, maybe we’d also get usefully, constructively excited about how fantastic our ship would look like when it’s built?</p><p><em><strong>Season 4 is a wrap!</strong><span> </span><a href="https://everythingisamazing.substack.com/p/season-4-wrap" rel="">Here’s what we’ve covered - and what’s coming next.</a></em></p><p><em><span>Images: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantropa#/media/File:Atlantropa.jpg" rel="">ittiz/Wikimedia</a><span>; </span><a href="https://www.environmentandsociety.org/arcadia/atlantropa-endless-energy-mediterranean-sea" rel="">Environment &amp; Society Portal</a><span>.</span></em></p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
