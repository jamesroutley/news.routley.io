<p>From <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">the Recurse Center</a> website:</p>
<blockquote>Invest six or 12 weeks programming at the edge of your abilities alongside motivated peers. Do a programming retreat in NYC, hybrid, or remotely.</blockquote>
<p>I was accepted into Recurse Center earlier this year and started my batch this past week, on May 19th, 2025.</p>
<p>While I&#39;m currently attending remotely from Seattle, I&#39;m putting plans in motion to make it out to NYC, to spend as much of my 12-week batch as I can at the hub in Brooklyn.</p>
<h3>What I&#39;m Doing At Recurse</h3>
<p>After working on <a href="https://github.com/WriteGames/canvas-lord">Canvas Lord</a> and <a href="https://writegames.com">WriteGames.com</a> on-and-off for the past 4 years, I&#39;m ready to put my head down and get them published!</p>
<p><img src="https://brethudson.com/img/uploads/0009-write-games.webp" alt="WriteGames.com banner image"/></p>
<p><strong>WriteGames.com</strong> is an upcoming educational game development website that uses <strong>Canvas Lord</strong> to power its interactive tutorials. Many of its individual components are built, but they need to be stitched together and made more robust.</p>
<p>Beyond that, I&#39;d like to learn how to maintain open-source projects, get comfortable contributing to other open-source projects, and remember what it was like being a fresh to game development. There&#39;s so much knowledge I take for granted, and being able to see things through the lens of folks figuring it all out is an opportunity I can&#39;t let pass by.</p>
<p>And, of course, I&#39;ll be doing a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a>! There&#39;s a few projects others have going on that I&#39;m looking forward to contributing to.</p>
<h3>What I Did This Week</h3>
<p>I wish I had taken better notes! So much happened this week.</p>
<p>There were interest groups for game development, TypeScript, and language/linguistics that I attended. Beyond that, I ended up meeting a handful of my batchmates, chatting about every topic under the sun: indie games, languages, Lego, food, math, CSS, graphics programming, game development, puzzles... the list could go for quite some time.</p>
<p>One of my batchmates, Cyrene, was working on a watercolor shader for their site. We worked on it during the pairing workshop, and almost got it working! It was my first time playing around with Three.js, which I was shocked to understand after having studied shaders last year. Just a couple years ago, it would have all been gibberish to me.</p>

<p>Wednesday&#39;s creative coding workshop had me teamed up with Raunak. Together, we extended a pong project of his using C &amp; Raylib, adding &#34;fake springs&#34; to collide with. Raunak&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/rrampage/skitter">codebase</a> is super clean, and Raylib seems pretty straight-forward. I might give it a go again at some point.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I decided to sign up for presentations. One of the hard parts of being remote is having everyone at the hub remember you&#39;re there, so I figured it&#39;d be good to make myself as visible as possible.</p>
<p>I gave a 5-minute presentation titled &#34;Making Games with the DOM&#34;. During the talk, I briefly touched on the history of interactive experiences in web browsers, and how you don&#39;t have to use any technologies beyond HTML, JS, and CSS to make games - not even the canvas! I showed off <a href="https://brethudson.com/yksi">Yksi</a>, <a href="https://wits.github.io/regretris">Regretris</a> (by <span><a href="https://wits.dev">WITS</a></span>), and <a href="https://brethudson.com/radical-scrabble">RADICAL SCRABBLE</a>, all of which use this DOM-based strategy.</p>
<h3>This Week&#39;s Daily Sketches</h3>
<p>One of the things I want to get out of Recurse is to work my educational muscles. I&#39;ve done tutoring and led programming classes in the past, and want to combine coding &amp; education. WriteGames.com.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also been posting vertical versions of each sketch to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/BretHudson">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brethudson/">Instagram</a> each day. Follow me to watch my progress as I make more complicated animations.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the first five sketches!</p>

<h3>More Posts, Maybe?</h3>
<p>We&#39;ll see how good I am with posting these - I waited until pretty late on Sunday to get this out. There are writing groups at Recurse, so ideally I&#39;ll be able to leverage those to help me stay accountable.</p>					</div>
