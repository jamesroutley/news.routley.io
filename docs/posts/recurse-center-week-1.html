    <h1>Recurse Center: Week 1</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><h2 id="wello-horld">Wello, horld!</h2><p>Earlier this month I decided to leave my job and spend a few weeks at the <a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, working on my programming skills and taking time to think about what I‚Äôd like to do next.</p><p>Participants aren‚Äôt <em>required</em> to write a blog about their time here, but it is a great way to document what you‚Äôve been doing in this busy period, for your future self if nobody else.</p><p>I‚Äôll cover more about what the Recurse Center is and why I chose to apply to it in a future post - for now this is just a lowdown on what I‚Äôve been doing in Week 1 of my batch.</p><h2 id="-python">üêç Python</h2><p>Something I‚Äôd like to cover during my time here is Python. I‚Äôve only ever really been a Javascript developer and picking up another language will increase my versatility. Like with human languages, knowing 2+ languages - whatever they are - gives you a better understanding of language as a whole.</p><p>When there are so many programming languages in the world, it can feel a bit hard to choose what you should pick or why. I chose Python purely based on its popularity - it was voted the 3rd most commonly used programming language in Stack Overflow‚Äôs <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages">2023 Developer Survey</a>.</p><p>It crops up a lot not just in things like web development, which is what I‚Äôve done since becoming a programmer in 2019, but also fields like data science and this little known thing which absolutely noone is talking about called machine learning.</p><p><img src="https://www.openbsd.org/beckham-meme.jpeg" alt="My favourite meme of the year" width="400"/></p><p>So with that goal in mind, here are some of the projects I‚Äôve chosen:</p><h3 id="a-very-simple-flask-server">A VERY simple Flask server</h3><p>A few months ago I put together a very basic Flask server that calls the <a href="https://developer.octopus.energy/docs/api/">Octopus Energy APIs</a>, and my first task was to revive that and add a couple of things.</p><p>Octopus Energy is my gas/electricity supplier in the UK and they allow customers to provision API keys and download their smart meter data. I had some vague idea that I would download this data and display it in a graph against other measures like the temperature at my location over the same time period, and/or the cost of gas/electricity at the same time, to see how the lines relate to each other. Perhaps this would reveal groundbreaking insights like ‚Äòwhen it‚Äôs cold, I turn the heating on‚Äô.</p><p><img src="https://www.openbsd.org/by-george.gif" alt="Who would have thought" width="400"/></p><p>Science will have to wait to see if that hypothesis is true because for now I‚Äôve left this project as just literally printing some unformatted JSON objects on a page. I‚Äôll probably come back to it later to add some kind of visualisation library in, but for now I felt like I‚Äôd got what I wanted out of the project - i.e. literally just writing my first Python project (wtf is a ‚Äòvenv‚Äô?), running a server, loading .env variables, making API calls, displaying output.</p><p>For now I‚Äôd like to move further outside of my comfort zone of webpage land, which led me to my next projects.</p><h3 id="kaggle">Kaggle</h3><p>As I mentioned above, one common application of Python is in machine learning. In 2024 it seems a bit remiss to have a career break and not touch on this a little bit.</p><p>Realistically I don‚Äôt see myself as being perfectly suited to the full mathsy linear algebra side of machine learning, but I thought working with some prebuilt tools could be interesting. That led me to <a href="https://kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> - a platform for data science learning and competions.</p><p>Kaggle have an entry-level <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic">challenge</a> where you build a simple model to predict the likelihood of certain passengers surviving the Titanic disaster, based on some given data such as age, gender, ticket class. First off‚Ä¶ I have to say this feels a bit tasteless - using personal tragedies in what is essentially a game. Putting those scruples aside though it is an excellent learning exercise, supported by the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning">Intro to Machine Learning</a> and <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning">Intermediate Machine Learning</a> short courses.</p><h3 id="chatgpt-cli">ChatGPT CLI</h3><p>The most significant thing I worked on was a CLI tool written in Python which lets you ask ChatGPT questions directly from your terminal. A motivator for this has been just how useful I‚Äôve found it as a development tool. Being able to find the answer to questions like ‚ÄòHow do I make an asynchronous non-blocking request?‚Äô or ‚ÄòWhy do I get this error about my EntryPoint?‚Äô directly inside the IDE, rather than having to switch over to the browser (and potentially succumb to distractions like my favourite - going down a rabbit hole on <a href="https://theguardian.com">the Guardian</a>), is massively helpful.</p><p><img src="https://www.openbsd.org/quaero-demo.gif" alt="Quaero in action"/></p><p>If you‚Äôd like to try it out, it‚Äôs called Quaero and is downloadable at <a href="https://pypi.org/project/quaero/">https://pypi.org/project/quaero/</a> üòä.</p><h2 id="other">Other</h2><p>I‚Äôve been trying to practise better developer habits as I‚Äôve gone about this - finding better ways to organise my ideas, document my findings, and move quickly around my environment.</p><p>This has included:</p><ul><li>Making extensive use of <a href="https://notion.so">Notion</a> to plan and record my work</li><li>Finally forcing myself to use Vim (or rather Vim bindings in VSCode)<ul><li>shout out to <a href="https://vim-adventures.com/">Vim Adventures</a> for actually making this fun</li><li>and <a href="https://www.editorskeys.com/en-us/products/vi-vim-keyboard-covers-for-macbook-imac">this handy keyboard cover</a> for when your memory fails you</li></ul></li><li>Making myself do things as much as possible from the CLI, in particular basic things like opening/deleting/moving files and directories</li></ul><h2 id="outro">Outro</h2><p>It‚Äôs been a hectic week - in terms of coding, being introduced to new ideas, and also just general life admin as I jumped into a lot of change in a very short space of time - but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve got to this place and am looking forward to what the following weeks bring!</p></div></div></div></div>
