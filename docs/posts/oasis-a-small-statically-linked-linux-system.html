    <h2>We Don&#39;t Say We&#39;re Never Going to Do It</h2>
    

<p>A quote from Ryan Holiday. Put here as a note to myself.</p>



<p><em>“It’s the biggest lie in the world, you may have said it to yourself today, you did may have heard it today, and it&#39;s this. I&#39;ll do it tomorrow. I&#39;ll do it when I wake up. I&#39;ll do it after I finish this. I&#39;ll do it when I retire. I&#39;ll do it when things are easier. I&#39;ll do it when things go back to normal. </em></p>

<p><em>Seneca said, the one thing all fools have in common is that they&#39;re always delaying to start. They&#39;re always getting ready to start. Marcus Aurelius says, you could be good today, instead you choose tomorrow. We choose tomorrow because we know it&#39;s not a real choice. We&#39;re not actually going to do it. It&#39;s just kicking the can down the road. It&#39;s a lie we tell ourselves. It&#39;s the biggest lie in the world. We don&#39;t say we&#39;re never going to do it. We say we&#39;re going to do it later, but we&#39;re not”</em><!-- notionvc: 8c8a3994-c3f8-4511-8449-6e9935d089d6 --></p>
