            <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgythu1000i0pgqfmd8n1zw@published" data-word-count="187">On December 2, YouTuber Harry Brewis, better known as hbomberguy, slid in just under the wire and dropped what might be the best, and certainly the most widely talked about, video essay of the year. It is a YouTube video essay about YouTube video essays — specifically, about the prevalence of intellectual theft and laziness in the format, done in the most thoroughly researched and un-lazy way imaginable. “Plagiarism and You(Tube)” is three hours and 51 minutes long. That’s 25 minutes longer than <em>Killers of the Flower Moon. </em>You might think such an inside-baseball topic with such a sober-sounding focus (when’s the last time you’ve had a lecture on plagiarism? College?) would draw an insular, self-selecting crowd; instead, the video has 10 million views and counting, largely because Brewis is really, really, really, really, really good at making videos. Take one of his most famous clips — eviscerating Ben Shapiro while slamming an ax through a wall like a righteous Jack Torrance — for the way he combines researched footage, production design, and above all, humor, full of takedowns toward people and institutions that do, in fact, deserve it.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgz3vi6001a3j81tr13drlz@published" data-word-count="224">Brewis has been at this game for a while, getting his start as an underpaid editor for a larger content channel before breaking out on his own, offering funny, insightful, and exasperated “measured responses” to YouTube pickup artists, climate-change deniers, and misogynists, and doing video-game and pop-culture analysis. In this video, he addresses the unchecked plagiarism that’s been allowed to proliferate in this space, and the scammy, scummy creators who don’t do much original creating at all while profiting off of fan bases who put their faith in them. The first half of the video focuses on a handful of cases, including one-woman content farm Iilluminaughtii and meme explainer Internet Historian, but it’s the second half that has ignited endless analysis on Twitter and TikTok. Brewis focuses on one creator in particular: James Somerton, a business major who pivoted to doing queer-media analysis in bisexual lighting for over 300,000 subscribers and 3,000 Patreons. Only he wasn’t doing any of the analyzing, instead ripping off entire passages from other, often less famous, queer writers’ work, and in some cases, taking clips and footage from their videos and documentaries and passing them off as his own. These include the written work of Stephen Spinks for defunct regional LGBTQ publication <em>Midlands Zone</em>, <em>The Celluloid Closet </em>author Vito Russo, and <em>Tinker Belles and Evil Queens </em>author Sean Griffin.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgz3vk7001b3j81x5ket46r@published" data-word-count="118">Part of what makes Brewis’s video so powerful is the way he explains the stakes of this issue: the erasure of queer thinkers’ work, the silencing when they tried to call Somerton out, the manipulation of an audience who trusted him, for his own financial gain; Somerton made a living off of the ad revenue from these videos and encouraged his audience to invest in film productions that never got made. With the help of his producer Kat Lo (because what we <em>will </em>be doing is giving credit), Brewis relates this to questions of art, queer community, and identity itself. He has pledged that ad revenue from his video will be redistributed among the creators Somerton stole from.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgz3vm2001c3j81a7jqcjhb@published" data-word-count="121">In the wake of this video, Somerton went offline. Other YouTubers published their own videos, both about <a href="https://youtu.be/FkuW7uKG6l8?si=qOuydBZGC8BowqKQ">plagiarism</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_LW1PkmnY&amp;pp=ygUidG9kZCBpbiB0aGUgc2hhZG93cyBqYW1lcyBzb21lcnRvbg%3D%3D">Somerton</a>, specifically. A conversation was ignited. On December 21, he posted (and took down and reuploaded) a tearful half-hour apology video, which does begin with him disclosing that he was hospitalized, implying self-harm, in the fallout from the essay. In the rest of the video, he dodges the word “plagiarism,” insists that he did not write any of the more offensive material (something probably disprovable, as he doesn’t show where he <em>did </em>get it from and insists that he’s not throwing his co-writer Nick Herrgott under the bus), and says he will be reinstating his Patreon. The backlash has been … <a href="https://twitter.com/0CEANKNIVES/status/1737702800157499752">considerable</a>.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgz3vnp001d3j81zzmt2mvl@published" data-word-count="81">We spoke with Brewis in the week after his original video went up, prior to Somerton’s reemergence, going in depth on topics like AI, the moral quandaries of “drama” videos, and why he didn’t even want to have to make this in the first place. “I don’t like starting fights,” he said. “It’s just I feel obligated to at a certain point. I hope this video gave the impression of someone who was dragged through the process somewhat against his will.”</p>

How does that feel?</strong></p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgzjt10003j3b7znmy8ohmf@published" data-word-count="86"><strong>There’s something that feels correct about this video coming out at the same time as George Santos being ousted from Congress.

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgz3whx001q3j81bd4a51gp@published" data-word-count="120">Another thing we looked at was, we found that Nick is a true writer, in the sense that he has a blog he updated three times and then gave up on, which we’ve all done. The way he would write around issues implies he has no idea what he’s talking about. Like when he was explaining what Orientalism is in this blog, he got his quote explaining what it is from the Wikipedia page for a book about Orientalism. And it wasn’t even a quote from the page itself. It was a quote from a review of the book, cited on the page. You know something’s bad when someone explains something and the quote is attributed to “Wikipedia Orientalism book.”</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgz3wjv001r3j81oak3c6hu@published" data-word-count="127"><strong>As if you can’t find a free Said PDF on the first page of Google results. </strong></p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgz3wns001t3j81spp0fkhm@published" data-word-count="116">I think people tend to fool themselves. People think they’re good at what they do, and they don’t question their practices. Because James and Nick both thought they were experts on the topics they talked about, they bumbled into so many blind alleys. I mentioned making this video to my friend Todd and he independently started watching James, and fell down all these rabbit holes, and made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A6_LW1PkmnY">a video</a> about him as well. It’s the Dunning-Kruger effect, when you’ve managed to stay at the top of the curve so you think, <em>I </em>must <em>be an expert, </em>and you never do any work that can disconfirm your hypothesis. It’s scary how easy it is to do that.</p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgzi5pv002e3b7z6xikucpl@published" data-word-count="211"><strong>Is there guilt that comes with doing such a thorough and complete dragging? </strong></p>

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgz3xr300243j815baej7oq@published" data-word-count="239"><strong>Was James’s behavior an open secret among YouTubers?

  <p data-editable="text" data-uri="www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clqgz3xur00263j81lzy51j43@published" data-word-count="113">The thing that really got to me was, for a while, I shot my videos with a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4k, and it was far too advanced for YouTube videos, so I don’t use it anymore. And Somerton has a much more expensive version of that camera, and it’s a B-cam that he doesn’t shoot anything with. It’s just a background prop in several of his videos, sitting there unused. And that fills me with a kind of disgust that can’t really be described unless you also do this and know how wasteful that is. So I feel Dan’s pain when he talks about the sheer, vast expense of all of this.</p>
