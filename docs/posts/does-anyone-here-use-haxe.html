    <h1>Ask HN: Does anyone here use Haxe?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I remember tinkering with Haxe maybe around ~2010. I was surprised to see it&#39;s still around and getting regular updates.</p><p>I was (and still am, in some ways) against the idea of learning one language and trying to use it everywhere. But nowadays, there are so many transpilation and adapter systems going on that... everything is a bit fuzzy.</p><p>That made me remember Haxe. Their goal all along was to have one unified language to deploy anywhere.</p><p>Does anyone here use Haxe regularly? In production? I&#39;d love to hear about your experiences and what you&#39;ve used it in-place of.</p></div></div></div>
