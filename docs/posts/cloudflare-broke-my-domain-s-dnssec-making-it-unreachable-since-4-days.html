    <h1>Ask HN: Cloudflare broke my domain&#39;s DNSSEC making it unreachable since 4 days</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>tl;dr - Cloudflare rendered my domain inaccessible and support has been ignoring the ticket for 4 days, what&#39;s the fastest way to get technical assistance when on a free plan?<p>Last week I transferred a domain used for a personal project from my old registrar to Cloudflare. After the transfer was finalized and new NS records had propagated, everything resolved normally and everything was working fine. I then enabled DNSSEC, and after a while the domain would no longer resolve. Every DNS server I try - Google, Quad9, OpenDNS, even Cloudflare&#39;s own DNS on 1.1.1.1 - returns SERVFAIL. The excellent diagnostic tool on dnsviz.net tells me that the domain is returning bogus DNSKEY/DS/NSEC responses and bogus delegation status. &#34;no SEP matching the DS found&#34;.</p><p>I tried canceling the DNSSEC setup and waiting for over a day, with no effect. I re-enabled DNSSEC setup and waited for 3 days, with no effect. Cloudflare&#39;s control panel has since several days now been saying that DNSSEC will be enabled &#34;in the next 24 hours&#34;. My site cannot be reached, and Cloudflare&#39;s support cannot be reached.</p><p>I&#39;ve been forced to migrate the project and its (few) users to a completely different domain. I cannot inconvenience users by bouncing them back and forth, so the domain Cloudflare ruined for me is now effectively lost, as is the &#34;branding&#34; of the project which was reflected in the domain&#39;s name.</p><p>How can I get their attention without paying for an Enterprise plan? I would like to think that basic functional service should be accessible even when using Cloudflare only as a registrar with fundamental DNS on a free plan.</p></div></div>
