    <h1>The saddest “just ship it” story ever (2020)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>I know, I know, at this point you want &#34;Just Ship It&#34; to be an actual person so you could punch it in the face. As an Indie Maker, that sentence can be super frustrating because it&#39;s tired, it&#39;s cliche, and your response is always &#34;HEY! You don&#39;t understand... it&#39;s not that easy&#34;.  </p> <p>I agree, it&#39;s not easy, but it&#39;s always the right thing to do. </p> <p>Here&#39;s why.  </p> <p>I started building an app on 01.01.2018. It was New Year&#39;s Eve and we just had the crappiest night ever. Yes, imagine a night <em>so bad</em> that at midnight you decide &#34;you know what, fuck it, I&#39;m gonna work on WEB DEVELOPMENT&#34;.</p> <p>The MVP was ready in a few days. I&#39;m not that good of a coder, it&#39;s just a simple app. The 0.0.1 alpha version was more than ready. I could&#39;ve released it, share it with a couple of people, and call it a day. I could&#39;ve done that with every single version that I made, at any point from 2018 until now. I just wanted to add one more thing. One more feature. Just this one more thing and people will like it. One more screen and everything is gonna make sense. I swear, just this one last thing and it&#39;s ready.  </p> <p>BAM, last moment decision from the world&#39;s biggest dumbass:
&#34;People wouldn&#39;t use this if it doesn&#39;t have a proper native mobile app for it. Time to learn React Native and spend a few months on that 🤦️&#34;   </p> <p>God, if time machines were real, past-Kitze would be shoved in a toilet so hard right now. </p> <p>After 2 years of development, juggling between the fucking horror that&#39;s the web platform, React Native, Expo, GraphQL, bitching about how there&#39;s no ideal tech stack, the good old jQuery and Filezilla days, switching to other projects, releasing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sizzy.co">other apps</a>, losing passion, finding passion, coming back to the app, etc. etc. etc...  </p> <p>I just dropped it.  </p> <p>I was still using it but I stopped developing it and just dropped the idea of releasing the app, ever.</p> <p>After a while, I was using it, but I realized that I&#39;m missing a lot of features, so I&#39;d either have to go back to developing it, or I&#39;d have to find an alternative.   </p> <p>And boy did I find one.  </p> <p>I was scrolling their landing page and I was happy and furious at the same time. Someone solved the problem that I was solving. It was like someone literally read my mind and started coding. WHAT.  </p> <p>I have previously sent a video of my app to a couple of people (closest I came to shipping it) so I started getting suspicious if someone actually shared the video of my app with these people because they were solving literally the same problem, and they most of the features that I had.  </p> <p>I started getting this overwhelming happy, sad, and panicky feeling. I literally cannot explain how I felt while scrolling their page.</p> <p>One moment I am scrolling their list of features giggling like a little kid with a 48$ bill in a candy store (yea I know 48$ bills don&#39;t make sense, but JavaScript doesn&#39;t make sense and you&#39;re still using it), one moment I want to find these people and THROW THEM IN A PIT OF LIONS.   </p> <p>FUCK.    </p> <p>It&#39;s not their fault. I was just slow. I didn&#39;t ship on time. I&#39;m gonna go ahead and tattoo &#34;JUST SHIP IT&#34; on my forehead. Nah I wouldn&#39;t be able to see it there. On my arm maybe. Nvm, let me go back to scrolling their landing page.  </p> <p>Fuck. They have solved everything that I wanted to solve, and WAY more. Hey, maybe I should be happy? I don&#39;t have to code anymore. Yay!? No more web platform? BLISS. Oh crap... the world is never gonna see my app though. But at least I don&#39;t have to see React Native anymore. NICE! Wait... BUT I WASTED SO MUCH TIME ON IT. FUCK.  A bunch of mixed feelings.  </p> <p>Here comes the saddest part, so grab a pack of tissues.   </p> <p>After a little bit of hesitation, I made an account. I watched the videos in their help center. Every time I caught myself smiling about a clever way they implemented something I slapped myself. NO. Bad Kitze. You shouldn&#39;t like this. THEY&#39;RE COMPETITORS. <em>sigh</em> Sure buddy, whatever you tell yourself. Competitors to a shitty codebase sitting on your hard drive.  </p> <p>For 2 frickin&#39; years, I thought it&#39;s too early to release my app because it&#39;s clunky, buggy, it&#39;s missing features, blah, blah, blah. No one would ever use it, right? I was so wrong.  </p> <p>I started using their app.  </p> <p>Even though they were working on it for the past few years it&#39;s still slow, buggy, and super unpolished, it doesn&#39;t matter, because they shipped.   </p> <p>Their mobile app is terrible and it needs 10 seconds to sync. It doesn&#39;t matter, they shipped. And I&#39;m looking forward to every single update they release.</p> <p>Their backlog of things to do is huge, but it doesn&#39;t matter, they ship every single week, and the app is growing along with the community.  </p> <p>&#34;But Kitze, even though tHeY sHiPpEd no one would pay for something unpolished and broken, right?&#34;  </p> <p>Oh, Indie Hackers. So clever, yet so naive.  </p> <p>Today my 30-day trial has expired. A tear rolled down my cheek for every single digit of my credit card that I entered in their app. I am officially not only a subscriber, but also a fan. Every time I&#39;ll get a payment notification it&#39;s gonna feel like stepping on a lego ... glued to a knife. My bank might as well change the notification from &#34;You have paid 5$ to ThatCompany&#34; to &#34;You never shipped, loser&#34;.   </p> <p>My app is officially dead.  </p> <p>99% of you are in the same boat right now, but hopefully just a few weeks into your project. Don&#39;t be a dumbass like me. Take a breath, roll your eyes at the cliche saying, but please...  </p> <p>Just Ship It.  </p> <p>P.S I would totally release and show you my app but ... it&#39;s not ready yet.  </p> <hr/><p>Thanks for reading this! I wrote another article about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://kitze.io/posts/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent">my successful shipping story</a>, so I&#39;d appreciate if you give it a read!</p> </div></div></div></div>
