                        The Agence nationale des fréquences (ANFR) has demanded that Apple withdraw the iPhone 12 from the French market, effective 12 September 2023, as measures show the specific absorption rate (SAR) exceeds the set limits. The ANFR expects Apple to deploy all available means to put an end to the non-compliance. Failure to act will result in the recall of equipment that has already been made available to consumers. 
                    </summary>
                
                
                    <p>As market surveillance authority for radio equipment and responsible for controlling public exposure to electromagnetic fields, the ANFR runs inspections on mobile phones placed on the French market. 141 mobile phones, including Apple’s iPhone 12, have recently been tested to check compliance with limit SAR values. SAR is a measure of the rate of radiofrequency energy absorbed by the body from the equipment being measured.</p>
<p>The mobile phones were tested by an accredited laboratory, which allows the ANFR to ensure that the SAR values comply with European regulation. These requirements entail that the equipment be tested at touch-contact (0 mm) for limb-SAR measures – where the phone is handheld or in a trouser pocket – and at a distance of 5 mm for body-SAR – where the phone is in the pocket of a jacket or in a bag. The values must therefore respect maximum limits of 4 Watts/kg for limb-SAR and 2 W/kg for body-SAR. The ANFR’s measures show that the limb-SAR values exceed the limit, being at 5,74 W/kg. However, the body-SAR complies with the regulation.</p>
<p>Consequently, Apple must immediately adopt all necessary measures to prevent the iPhone 12 in the supply chain from being made available on the market. As for those telephones that are already in use, Apple must adopt all necessary corrective measures to bring the telephones into conformity as soon as possible, otherwise, Apple will have to recall the equipment.</p>
<p>If Apple chooses to update its telephones, it shall be verified by the ANFR.</p>
<p>Instruction has been given to the ANFR’s sworn officers to check that the iPhone 12 is no longer offered for sale in all distribution channels in France, from Tuesday 12 September 2023.</p>
