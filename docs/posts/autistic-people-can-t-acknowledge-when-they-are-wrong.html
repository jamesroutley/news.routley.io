    <h1>“Autistic people can&#39;t acknowledge when they are wrong”</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I have heard this sentence many times in my life, always in the workplace. This puzzles me as I pride myself on seeking out things I am wrong about and learning things I don&#39;t know. I have read similar experiences by other autistic people, which has helped me restore my self-confidence and given me a framework to analyze these situations. I want to share my experiences and insight to help allistic people become more aware of autistic communication patterns.</p>
<p>When these conflicts arise, here are some things that might be happening.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-allistic-person-is-not-hearing-what-i-m-saying">1. The allistic person is not hearing what I&#39;m saying.</h2>
<p>I know my thinking can be alien at times, which requires me to establish a context for them to use to understand what I&#39;m saying. This can take a few minutes. However, people can become impatient and cut me off or interject with a snap interpretation of what I have said so far. Any attempt to continue my train of thought will often be interpreted as me pushing back against them in a combative or argumentative manner. As a result, I cannot get my point across; therefore, they assume that I am &#34;just not getting it.&#34;</p>
<h2 id="2-i-need-to-ask-questions-before-forming-an-opinion">2. I need to ask questions before forming an opinion.</h2>
<p>A similar scenario happens when people ask for my opinion. If I don&#39;t have enough information, I won&#39;t be able to formulate an answer. This means I often have to ask several clarifying questions first.</p>
<p>Because I tend to think holistically, my questions may seem unrelated to the original question. I reason in terms of systems, networks, interfaces, communication patterns, and feedback loops; these systems span software, infrastructure, teams, products, and business goals. Often, people will be surprised, not understanding why I am asking a certain question. Queue frustration and the dismissive &#34;you&#39;re not getting it.&#34;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a concrete example:</p>
<p>A manager came to me asking if we should rewrite the checkout of our E-Commerce platform using React because they had read a blog post about another company doing it. I entertained the question in good faith. However, in order to make an informed decision, I needed to understand a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is our checkout page not performing well?</li>
<li>Will a new checkout solve our problem?</li>
<li>Why do they think a technology change is a solution?</li>
<li>Do they understand the implications of such a switch?</li>
</ul>
<p>In this particular situation, the discussion never got past the first question. I needed to understand why our checkout had to be improved; I explained that technology choices made no difference to the user. However, the manager interpreted my words as outright rejecting their idea.</p>
<h2 id="3-i-care-more-about-doing-good-work-than-office-politics">3. I care more about doing good work than office politics.</h2>
<p>A typical piece of advice I receive is that there comes the point where you need to &#34;give in,&#34; especially to people in authority. This preserves peace in the workplace and helps with promotions. However, &#34;giving in&#34; is not the same as acknowledging when you are wrong: it is simply playing mind games—games I am not interested in playing.</p>
<p>There is more to life: I am an engineer; I like solving problems. I embrace fairness and open intellectual exchange. This matters to me a whole lot more than getting promoted. Plus, &#34;giving in&#34; does not preserve peace—it simply appeases bullies and makes the workplace toxic.</p>
<h2 id="4-the-person-underestimates-how-much-i-know-about-the-topic">4. The person underestimates how much I know about the topic.</h2>
<p>I don&#39;t have a college degree, but I have been a professional developer for 23 years. During that time, I spent ten hours per day doing &#34;computer stuff.&#34; Because I value learning, I read about 50 technical books every year, studying ten of them in-depth, doing exercises, annotating the text, and watching related lectures. I attend conferences and am active in dozens of expert communities. This is something that I rarely share, with this being the first time I have done so publicly. People often think that I am bragging, but it is just what I enjoy doing.</p>
<p>In turn, I often encounter people with college degrees and two or three, or even ten years of experience confidently stating something I know is incorrect. When I try to engage them in good faith about it, they often assume their degree gives them an all-encompassing authority to be right.</p>
<p>I know better than to argue intangibles such as coding style or software architecture, but some things in Computer Science are just facts: we can verify them. I don&#39;t care much for saying false things to appease someone&#39;s ego. In cases like this, I&#39;m not the one who can&#39;t acknowledge being wrong.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Whenever I would experience any of these conflicts, at the first hint of tension, my strategy was to leave the room quietly. In the long run, it was socially traumatic, and I got severely burnt out. In the future, I will look for a professional environment that understands and accommodates divergent ways of thinking.</p>
<p>I hope that sharing these insights will lead to broader acceptance of how some of us think. Allistic communication patterns can stifle and harm us—this is detrimental to autistic people and a significant loss to any workplace.</p>
