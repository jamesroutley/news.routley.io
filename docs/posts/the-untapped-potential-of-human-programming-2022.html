You scan a QR code on the machine, which brings up a virtual assistant to guide you through brewing your coffee. The assistant asks you: “what kind of coffee are you making?” with choices “cappuccino”, “americano”, etc. You select “cappuccino” and the virtual assistant guides you step by step through the brewing process. One step of the process is unclear:</em></p><blockquote><p><em><code>Pour milk into the milk compartment.</code></em></p></blockquote><p><em>“Can I use my almond milk?”, you wonder. You click a button labeled “need help?” and are immediately connected with customer support. The customer-support agent speaking with you sees the exact instruction you needed help with. The agent answers your question, then edits the instruction that was unclear, to now read:</em></p><blockquote><p><em><code>Pour milk (any cow’s milk or barista-grade milk alternatives) into the milk compartment.</code></em></p></blockquote><p><em>All future users of the coffee machine will see the updated instruction when they use the virtual assistant.</em></p><p>Human programming is a massively important yet overlooked aspect of our lives. </p><p><span>Human programming is the practice of writing sequences of instructions for humans, often yourself, to follow.

The “stop drop &amp; roll” program can be encoded in an image, as shown above, but could also be encoded as text, audio, or even a simple flowchart.</p><p><span>The tools and media we use to </span><em>write </em><span>and to </span><em>follow</em><span> human programs are mostly pretty terrible. Many human programs are presented as </span><a href="https://jamesclear.com/three-steps-habit-change" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">articles</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/five-things-you-should-do_b_1263515" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">listicles</a><span>. Articles are pretty easy to write, but very difficult to follow; how often has an article truly induced you to start a new routine? Some how-to guides like </span><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Cook-Broccoli" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Wikihow</a><span> are better than your average article because they have clearly delineated steps and visuals. However, the Wikihow format fails to encode complex or non-linear processes. For example, if you want to help people improve their relationships, you would have a hard time encoding your advice as a generally-applicable linear sequence of steps, though people on Wikihow </span><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Be-Kind-to-Your-Sister" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">do try</a><span>.</span></p><p>Flowcharts are better for encoding nonlinear sets of instructions, but they too have their downsides: a flowchart creator must take time to arrange the nodes in their chart, which adds friction to the writing experience. And to follow a complex flow chart, the user must keep track of their position, which is especially difficult while context switching.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72804e94-4c0a-485e-aaba-330c0b656327_1480x1089.png" rel="nofollow ugc noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72804e94-4c0a-485e-aaba-330c0b656327_1480x1089.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72804e94-4c0a-485e-aaba-330c0b656327_1480x1089.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72804e94-4c0a-485e-aaba-330c0b656327_1480x1089.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72804e94-4c0a-485e-aaba-330c0b656327_1480x1089.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72804e94-4c0a-485e-aaba-330c0b656327_1480x1089.png" width="1456" height="1071" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/72804e94-4c0a-485e-aaba-330c0b656327_1480x1089.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1071,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;xkcd: Map Age Guide&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="xkcd: Map Age Guide" title="xkcd: Map Age Guide" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72804e94-4c0a-485e-aaba-330c0b656327_1480x1089.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72804e94-4c0a-485e-aaba-330c0b656327_1480x1089.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72804e94-4c0a-485e-aaba-330c0b656327_1480x1089.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F72804e94-4c0a-485e-aaba-330c0b656327_1480x1089.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>A complex flowchart for analyzing world maps, from XKCD.

Though it is not exactly presented as a human-programming tool (it’s more for creating surveys), Guidedtrack can be used to design complex sequences of prompts. Guidedtrack is exemplary in that it separates the experience of </span><em>writing</em><span> a program from that of </span><em>following</em><span> a program: writing a Guidedtrack program is like writing code and </span><a href="https://www.guidedtrack.com/programs/6pksanj/run" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">following a Guidedtrack program</a><span> is like following a survey.</span></p><p><span>Still, Guidedtrack is not perfectly suited as a human-programming tool: the coding language, which is great for creating complex surveys, is not optimized for rapidly iterating or modifying sequences of imperative prompts. Also, Guidedtrack is not a </span><em>platform for discovering programs</em><span> in the way that Wikihow is. That said, many of Guidedtrack’s features, especially on the writing side, would serve as good inspiration for a human-programming-specific tool.</span></p><p>In sum, I think that no one has made a great human-programming tool because no one has developed a tool with human programming specifically in mind. I hope to do so.</p><p>I believe that widespread use of effective human-programming tools could dramatically increase our productivity. With general-purpose human-programming tools we could externalize our work processes, lifting workflows out of our brains and dropping them into symbolic networks to be distributed, analyzed, fine-tuned, and remixed by communities of “human programmers”.</p><p>Anyone could instantly tap into this network and summon an interactive virtual assistant to guide them through the steps necessary to achieve any goal. Any workflow, no matter how hairy or complex, would be reduced to two steps:</p><ol><li><p>Click a button</p></li><li><p>Follow an instruction</p><p>(and repeat)</p></li></ol><p><em><span>Your friend recently read the life-planning book </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Your-Life-Well-Lived-Joyful/dp/1101875321" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Designing Your Life</a><span>, and recommends it to you.

And, while the encoding scheme can be </span><em>inspired</em><span> by existing tools and languages, it cannot be copied in the same way that the user interfaces for the tool could be. It’s the core of human programming, and it’s the thing that doesn’t yet exist.</span></p><p>Throughout this essay I’ve hinted at some aspects of an encoding that I think would be useful: goal→subtask relationships with overlapping hierarchy, variables, conditional branching, cascading permissions, instruction←→workspace pairs, and sessions as data. However, these features are mostly based on intuition. Developing the most useful encoding scheme will require:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall&#39;s_law" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Tons of iterative development</a></p></li><li><p><span>Study of the nature of workflows, how people think about them, and </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructional_design" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">how people follow them</a></p></li><li><p><span>Imagination, to envision new </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">software design patterns</a><span> that combine the strengths of human and computer execution</span></p></li></ul><p><span>After externalizing our existing workflows, we will develop entirely new workflows that are currently unimaginable: workflows that make full use of our cognition and skills, but are no longer constrained by the limits of human memory and executive functioning. We will develop a new way of thinking: “what can I do?” will become “what can I and an army of my future selves do?” or, better yet, </span><strong>“what can I and an army of my future selves </strong><em><strong>who each command their own army of future selves</strong></em><strong> do?”</strong><span> This new way of thinking will give us the power to set ambitious goals and systematically turn them into reality.</span></p><p>The vastness of possibility afforded by human programs draws me towards making effective human programming a reality.</p><p>I’ll leave you with one last example…</p><p><em>You walk to your favorite cafe, sit down, stretch, and open your computer.</em></p><blockquote><p><em><code><span>Good morning!
