    <p>Recently I was described as <strong>“pro-AI”</strong>. “Oh, ChatGPT? You should ask Nick about that, he’s <em>pro-AI</em>.”</p>

<p>I was a little taken aback, as “pro-AI” is not how I would ever think to describe my own thoughts and feelings. It’s not <em>wrong</em> wrong, I guess. I mean, I’m not <em>anti</em>-AI in the way that some people are. But still, “pro-AI” is too vague to be useful, and is prone to wild misinterpretation.</p>

<p><em>“Okay, so how do you want to be described then?”</em></p>

<p>At this point, with respect to AI, I think my position can be summed up as <strong><em>optimistic resignationism</em></strong>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Resignationist</em></strong>: this technology will be <em>dramatically impactful</em> in <em>all sorts of ways</em>, and its development is <em>inevitable</em> and <em>unstoppable</em>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong><em>Optimistic</em></strong>: along with all of its many negative impacts, there will be <em>lots of cool and amazing things</em>, and maybe even the possibility for some <em>positive social change</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In short: <strong>It’s going to be a bumpy ride to an unknown destination. But the in-flight entertainment will be great.</strong></p>
