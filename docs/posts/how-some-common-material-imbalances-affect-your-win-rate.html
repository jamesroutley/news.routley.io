    <h1>How some common material imbalances affect your win-rate</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><strong>How much more likely are you to win after winning the exchange? What about two minors for a rook? What about two rooks for a queen? What about...</strong></p><div><p>I was curious exactly how much the various material imbalances help you win chess games.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t find a good answer, so I pulled the last 100 million Lichess games, determined what material imbalances were involved in each game, looked at how</p>
<p>These were all the imbalances I tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being up a &#34;clean&#34; pawn/bishop/knight/rook</li>
<li>Having the only bishop pair</li>
<li>Trading a minor piece for 3 pawns</li>
<li>Being up &#34;the exchange&#34; (trading a minor piece for a rook)</li>
<li>Being up two minors for a rook</li>
<li>Being up two rooks for a queen</li>
</ul>
<p>I looked at all of these for the elo ranges 0-800, 800-1000, 1200-1400, 1600-1800,</p>
<p>If you want to test your intuitions, it might be worth spending a minute or</p>
<p>Personally this is sort of what I assumed I&#39;d find:</p>
<ol>
<li>Imbalances would matter a lot less at lower Elo ranges than higher Elo ranges</li>
<li>There would be some imbalances that are useful at a lower Elo</li>
</ol>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>Here are the full results in infographic form, it might help to click on it to see it in full-screen:</p>
<h3>Being &#34;up&#34; two rooks for a queen is actually generally a disadvantage</h3>
<p>This was very surprising. Even at the higher levels, having two rooks for a queen is generally a signal that you&#39;re slightly more likely to <strong>lose</strong>, not win. It&#39;s more pronounced at the lower elo ranges, but it&#39;s still a &lt;50% winrate in 2200+ Elo games.</p>
<h3>Advantages are surprisingly stable across Elo ranges</h3>
<p>I thought there would be huge differences across Elo ranges, and there&#39;s definitely some trends by Rlo, but it&#39;s not as extreme as I had thought.</p>
<p>This is particularly surprising to me with the more minor advantages like being up a pawn, or more theoretical advantages like being up the bishop pair. Even at lower Elo ranges like 1200-1400, you&#39;re 4-5% more likely to win if you have the only bishop pair. 1200 Elo players don&#39;t know how to take advantage of having the bishop pair, and yet it helps them win all the same, about the same amount it helps 2200 players in fact. There&#39;s something sort of fascinating about these helping you win regardless of whether you really know how to handle them.</p>
<h3>Lower Elo ranges struggle to use two minors against a rook</h3>
<p>A 1000-1200 Elo player is only about 8% more likely to win when up two minors for a rook. A 2200+ player is 35% more likely to win with the same advantage.</p>
<p>Clearly there&#39;s a certain amount of skill needed to take advantage of this imbalance.</p>
