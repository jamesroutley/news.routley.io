    <h1>Gene Hackman has died</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="site-content"><div><article id="story"><section name="articleBody"><div data-testid="companionColumn-0"><div><p>Gene Hackman, who never fit the mold of a Hollywood movie star but became one all the same, playing seemingly ordinary characters with deceptive subtlety, intensity and often charm in some of the most noted films of the 1970s and ’80s, has died, the authorities in New Mexico said on Thursday. He was 95.</p><p>Mr. Hackman and his wife were found dead on Wednesday afternoon at the home in Santa Fe., N.M., where they had been living, according to a statement from the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Department. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/us/gene-hackman-wife-dead-new-mexico.html" title="">The cause of death was unclear and under investigation</a>. Sheriff’s deputies found the bodies of Mr. Hackman; his wife, Betsy Arakawa, 64; and a dog, according to the statement, which said that foul play was not suspected.</p><p>Mr. Hackman was nominated for five Academy Awards and won two during a 40-year career in which he appeared in films seen and remembered by millions, among them “Bonnie and Clyde,” “The French Connection,” “The Poseidon Adventure,” “Mississippi Burning,” “Unforgiven,” “Superman,” “Hoosiers” and “The Royal Tenenbaums.”</p><p>The familiar characterization of Mr. Hackman was that he was Hollywood’s perfect Everyman. But perhaps that was too easy. His characters — convict, sheriff, Klansman, steelworker, spy, minister, war hero, grieving widower, submarine commander, basketball coach, president — defied pigeonholing, as did his shaded portrayals of them.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><div><p>Still, he did not deny that he had a regular-Joe image, nor did he mind it. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/19/magazine/hollywood-s-uncommon-everyman.html" title="">He once joked</a> that he looked like “your everyday mine worker.” And he did seem to have been born middle-aged: slightly balding, with strong but unremarkable features neither plain nor handsome, a tall man (6-foot-2) more likely to melt into a crowd than stand out in one.</p><p>It was Mr. Hackman’s gift to be able to peel back the layers from characters who carried the weight of middle age.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-3"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><picture><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 3),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 3dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 288dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/24/obituaries/00Hackman2/00Hackman2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1800"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 2),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 192dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/24/obituaries/00Hackman2/00Hackman2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=1200"/><source media="(max-width: 599px) and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 1dppx),(max-width: 599px) and (min-resolution: 96dpi)" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/24/obituaries/00Hackman2/00Hackman2-mobileMasterAt3x.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale&amp;width=600"/><img alt="Mr. Hackman, wearing a sports jacket with a badge on it and a porkpie hat, raises his right hand as several other people stand behind him on a street." src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/24/obituaries/00Hackman2/00Hackman2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp&amp;disable=upscale" srcset="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/24/obituaries/00Hackman2/00Hackman2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 600w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/24/obituaries/00Hackman2/00Hackman2-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 1024w,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/24/obituaries/00Hackman2/00Hackman2-superJumbo.jpg?quality=75&amp;auto=webp 2048w" sizes="((min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1004px)) 84vw, (min-width: 1005px) 60vw, 100vw" uri="nyt://image/9d80ae3c-5d6d-504a-87ca-d4c83adda37d" decoding="async" width="600" height="401"/></picture></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Hackman as Popeye Doyle in the 1971 film “The French Connection.” The role earned him his first Academy Award.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">20th Century Fox, via Photofest</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-2"><div><p>“Because they’ve been around long enough to experience failure and loss, but not long enough to take it easy, Hackman could play them with a distinctive mix of shadow and light,” Jeremy McCarter <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/disappearance-gene-hackman-71235" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote in an appraisal</a> of Mr. Hackman’s career in Newsweek in 2010, six years after the release of what turned out to be his last film, the comedy “Welcome to Mooseport,” and two years after he confirmed that he did not plan to make any more movies.</p><p>“While some actors congratulate themselves for venturing into the moral gray zone,” Mr. McCarter continued, “Hackman has called it home for so long that we’ve ceased to notice. In his performances, as in life, the good guys aren’t always nice guys, and the villains have charm.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-3"><div><p>If the critics had one word for Mr. Hackman as a performer, it was “believable.” He seemed to live his roles, they said, not play them.</p><p>“There’s no identifiable quality that makes Mr. Hackman stand out,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times in 1988. “He simply makes himself outstandingly vital and real.”</p><p>He avoided self-analysis when he talked about acting. “I don’t like to look real deep at what I do with my characters,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/19/magazine/hollywood-s-uncommon-everyman.html" title="">he once said</a>. “It is that strange fear that if you look at something too closely, it goes away.”</p><p>Mr. Hackman was forever associated with his breakout role: the crude, relentless narcotics cop Popeye Doyle — a grim-faced bloodhound in a porkpie hat — in the hit 1971 film “The French Connection.” That performance brought him his first Academy Award, as best actor.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-7"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Hackman, right, with Willem Dafoe in “Mississippi Burning” (1988).

He received an Oscar nomination for his work in Alan Parker’s “Mississippi Burning” (1988), in which he played an F.B.I. agent investigating the disappearance of three civil rights workers — a “scratchy, rumpled, down-home-talking redneck, who himself has murder in his heart,” as Vincent Canby <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/09/movies/review-film-retracing-mississippi-s-agony-1964.html" title="">wrote in The Times</a>.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-5"><div><p>In “Unforgiven” (1992), as a vicious small-town sheriff who crosses six-guns with a bounty hunter played by Clint Eastwood, he was a chilling study in sadistic brutality. That performance brought him his second Oscar, as best supporting actor.</p><h2 id="link-59783c8f">Early Accolades</h2><p>Early in his career Mr. Hackman worked in television, on shows like “Route 66” and “Naked City,” in improvisational theater and in Broadway comedies, including Muriel Resnik’s “Any Wednesday,” with Sandy Dennis, and Jean Kerr’s “Poor Richard,” with Alan Bates and Joanna Pettet. His performance in a bit part in a 1964 Warren Beatty movie, “Lilith,” made a lasting impression on Mr. Beatty, who remembered him when he was producing “Bonnie and Clyde” and looking for someone to play Buck Barrow, the explosive brother of the gangster Clyde Barrow (played by Mr. Beatty). Mr. Hackman’s performance in that film, directed by Arthur Penn and released in 1967, brought him his first Oscar nomination.</p><p>By the time the director William Friedkin cast him in “The French Connection,” Mr. Hackman had more than a dozen films under his belt and a second supporting-actor Oscar nomination, for “I Never Sang for My Father” (1970), in which he played a widower coping with a demanding parent (played by Melvyn Douglas).</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-11"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Hackman, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway in “Bonnie and Clyde.” Mr. Hackman’s performance brought him his first Academy Award nomination, for best supporting actor.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Warner Brothers, via Everett Collection</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-6"><div><p>Not all his roles explored life’s dark side. His knack for comedy, honed on the stage, resurfaced in Mel Brooks’s “Young Frankenstein” (1974), in which he had a cameo role as a blind hermit who unknowingly plays host to the monster, and served him well in later films like “The Birdcage” (1996) and “The Royal Tenenbaums” (2001).</p><p>By the mid-1970s Mr. Hackman was making movies at such a pace that he became known as the hardest-working actor in Hollywood. In 1972 he appeared in three feature films, most notably “The Poseidon Adventure,” in which he played a minister trying to survive with other frantic passengers aboard a capsized ocean liner. (The other two were “Prime Cut” and “Cisco Pike.”) He repeated that trifecta in 1974 with “Young Frankenstein,” the western “Zandy’s Bride” and “The Conversation,” Francis Ford Coppola’s taut, understated drama about a surveillance expert who becomes involved in trying to prevent a murder.</p><p>His work in “The Conversation” was one of a string of critically acclaimed performances in the 1970s; among the others were his brawling ex-con in “Scarecrow” (1973) — which he considered the best performance of his career — and his troubled private eye in “Night Moves” (1975), in which he was reunited with Arthur Penn. But perhaps inevitably, given how many there were, his performances were often routine.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-14"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Hackman played a surveillance expert who becomes involved in trying to prevent a murder in the 1974 Francis Ford Coppola drama “The Conversation.”</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Paramount Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-7"><p>Mr. Hackman was making lots of money, but he was also wearing himself out. His return appearance as Popeye Doyle in “French Connection II” in 1975 was one of four Hackman films that were released that year. By the end of the decade, he decided he’d had enough for a while.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-8"><div><p>After playing Lex Luthor, nemesis of the Man of Steel, in “Superman” (1978) — and simultaneously filming his scenes for “Superman II,” released two years later — Mr. Hackman briefly left Hollywood. He did not make another film until “All Night Long,” a comedy co-starring Barbra Streisand, in 1981.</p><p>His streak of well-received performances soon resumed: as a high school basketball coach in search of redemption in “Hoosiers” (1986) and a government official who accidentally murders his mistress in “No Way Out” (1987); as a district attorney trying to protect a witness from two hit men in “Narrow Margin” (1990); and, in “The Birdcage,” a remake of the French comedy “La Cage aux Folles,” as a pompous conservative politician whose daughter’s fiancé turns out to have two gay men, one of them a drag performer, as parents.</p><h2 id="link-4f14b294">No Slowing Down</h2><p>Even the heart surgery he underwent in 1990 did not slow his pace. In 2001, a year after turning 70, Mr. Hackman was seen in five films: the comedy “The Heartbreakers,” as a tobacco tycoon; “Heist,” David Mamet’s story of an elaborately planned robbery, as a master thief contemplating retirement; “Behind Enemy Lines,” as a naval chief trying to rescue a pilot shot down over Bosnia; “The Mexican,” a comedy adventure starring Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts, as an imprisoned mob boss; and Wes Anderson’s quirky “The Royal Tenenbaums,” as the absentee father of three prodigiously talented children.</p><p>That same year the critic David Edelstein, writing in The Times, noted that unlike most actors of comparable stature, Mr. Hackman occupied “a middle ground between character acting and movie stardom.” He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/16/movies/gene-hackman-hollywood-s-every-angry-man.html" title="">suggested one key to Mr. Hackman’s success</a>: “Even at their jauntiest, Mr. Hackman’s performances have volcanic undercurrents. It might be that the secret of his uniqueness is that his comfort zone is such a scary and volatile place.”</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-18"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Wes Anderson&#39;s “The Royal Tenenbaums” (2001) was one of Mr. Hackman’s last films before he unofficially retired from acting.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Buena Vista Pictures</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-9"><div><p>Eugene Allen Hackman was born in San Bernardino, Calif., on Jan. 30, 1930, and grew up in Danville, Ill. His father, also named Eugene, was a pressman for the local newspaper. His mother, Anna Lyda (Gray) Hackman, was a waitress.</p><p>When young Gene was 13, his father abandoned the family, driving away while his son was out playing in the street. As his father passed by, Mr. Hackman recalled years later, he gave him a wave of the hand.</p><p>“I hadn’t realized how much one small gesture can mean,” he once said. “Maybe that’s why I became an actor.” </p><p>Lying about his age, he enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1946 and served in China and then in Hawaii and Japan, at one point working as a disc jockey for his unit’s radio station. After his discharge, he studied journalism at the University of Illinois for six months and then went to New York to learn about television production.</p><p>He worked at local stations around the country before deciding to study acting, first in New York and then at the Pasadena Playhouse in California, where Dustin Hoffman was a fellow student. They <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/12/movies/film-the-50-year-hoffman-hackman-history.html#:~:text=Though%20Mr.,in%20the%20John%20Grisham%20franchise." title="">struck up a lasting friendship</a>, though they did not appear in a film together until 2003, when they were both in “Runaway Jury,” a courtroom drama based on a John Grisham novel.</p></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-10"><div><p>Back in New York, Mr. Hackman met and married Faye Maltese, a bank secretary, and began the classic actor’s struggle to survive. “I drove a truck, jerked sodas, sold shoes,” he told an interviewer.</p><h2 id="link-1731bcba">A Broadway Hit</h2><p>Eventually he found theater work, first in summer stock and then Off Broadway. In “Any Wednesday” — his third Broadway play, but the first to last more than a few days — he played a young man from Ohio who goes to New York and falls in love with a tycoon’s mistress. The critics applauded, the play was a hit, and Mr. Hackman never had to sell another pair of shoes.</p><p>Mr. Hackman’s first marriage ended in divorce in 1986, after several trial separations. In 1991 he married Ms. Arakawa, a classical pianist, and they settled in Santa Fe. Survivors include three children from his first marriage, Christopher, Elizabeth and Leslie, and a granddaughter.</p></div></div><div data-testid="ImageBlock-23"><div data-testid="imageblock-wrapper"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children-figure"><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="photoviewer-children-caption"><span>Mr. Hackman and his wife, Betsy Arakawa, at the Golden Globe Awards in Los Angeles in 2003.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-11"><p>Mr. Hackman returned to the stage in 1992, opposite Glenn Close and Richard Dreyfuss in Mike Nichols’s production of “Death and the Maiden,” Ariel Dorfman’s play about a Latin American woman (Ms. Close) who succeeds in trapping the man (Mr. Hackman) she believes had raped and tortured her as a political prisoner years earlier. It was his first appearance on Broadway in 25 years; it was also his last.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-12"><div><p>In his later years Mr. Hackman devoted much of his time to painting and sculpture at his adobe home in Santa Fe. He also became a published author. He collaborated with his friend Daniel Lenihan, an underwater archaeologist, on three historical novels, and later wrote “Payback at Morning Peak” (2011), a western, and “Pursuit” (2013), a thriller.</p><p>He never formally retired from acting, but he told an interviewer in 2008 that he had given it up because he did not want to “keep pressing” and risk “going out on a real sour note.” Three years later, when <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/gene-hackman-gq-june-2011-interview" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an interviewer for GQ magazine</a> told him, “You’ve got to do one more movie,” he said, “If I could do it in my own house, maybe, without them disturbing anything and just one or two people.”</p><p>In that same interview, Mr. Hackman was asked to sum up his life in a single phrase. He replied:</p><p>“‘He tried.’ I think that’d be fairly accurate.”</p><p>Robert Berkvist<!-- -->, a former New York Times arts editor, died in 2023. <!-- -->Yan Zhuang<!-- --> and <!-- -->Alex Marshall<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section><div><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Feb. 27, 2025</p><p>: </p><p>An earlier version of this obituary misstated the name of one movie in which Mr. Hackman appeared.
