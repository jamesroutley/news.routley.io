<p>There’s a story old Unix beards tell about how they learned Unix.
<q>We just read all the manpages,</q> they say, <q>that’s how well
written they are, you don’t need to read anything else or take any
classes. Maybe also pick up a copy of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">K&amp;R</a>
if you’re a little iffy on C.</q></p>
<p>I consider myself an old Unix beard, even though I don’t have a beard
and I only got into the game in the days of SunOS 4.1, and until quite
recently I thought this was how <em>I</em> learned Unix. I <em>did</em>
read all the manpages, without any formal coursework, and trained myself
up as a programmer to the point where I could get a job in the industry.
It took three years of self-study and experimentation, consuming nearly
all my free time, and in retrospect I wouldn’t recommend the experience,
but, y’know, it worked out, right?</p>
<p>But the thing is, this story completely neglects all the things I’d
already learned about computers and programming <em>before</em> I got to
college.</p>

<p>As a kid I read every single book in the house, indiscriminately, no
matter how boring it would seem to an adult—including a bunch of old
computer science textbooks that we had for some reason. And I spent a
bunch of time tinkering around with computer programming, mostly
<em>not</em> on Unix and <em>not</em> in C, but still. When I came to
the manpages I had the beginnings of a conceptual structure for
understanding systems programming in my brain already.</p>
<p>I realized this only because of the experience I’ve had over the past
two years in <em>teaching</em> computer science—specifically, CMU’s
<q><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/">Introduction to Computer
Systems</a></q> course, which, at first glance, <em>seems</em> to have a
lot of overlap with the content I used to think I learned from the
manpages. But as I repeat the lessons for each new batch of
undergraduates, and especially as I spend time helping them with the
specific things they get stuck on, I’ve come to realize that what I’m
actually teaching is the stuff I <em>already knew</em> when I
<em>started</em> reading the manpages. And, also, that I would not have
been able to get much out of the manpages if I hadn’t already known that
stuff.</p>
<p>So, okay, why does it <em>matter</em> that I didn’t learn my trade
the way I thought I did? Because, first, holding up <q>the manpages</q>
as ideal documentation is a mistake. They are pretty darn good
<em>reference</em> documentation within their domain, and that’s why
they appeal so much to experts: if you <em>already know</em> most of
what there is to know about a standard C library function, or a Unix
shell command, and you just need a bit of a reminder on how to do one
specific thing, the manpages will not let you down. Reference
documentation for other languages and tools is often frustrating by
comparison. But, if you <em>don’t</em> already know, if you don’t have
the concepts and the mental models, reference documentation is <em>not
what you want</em>. Instead you need a guide, or a textbook.</p>
<p>(I <em>did</em> read lots and lots of guides and textbooks, before,
during, and after those three years of self-study and experimentation.
I’d expect that <em>most</em> of the people who call themselves Unix
beards had done the same. In retrospect, I got so much more out of <q><a href="https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">Starting FORTH</a></q> and
<q><a href="https://www.powells.com/book/tcpip-network-administration-9780596002978">TCP/IP
Network Administration</a></q> and the <a href="https://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/book/Weismann_LISP1.5_Primer_1967.pdf">Lisp
1.5 Primer</a> and some 1975-vintage algorithms textbook whose name I
can’t remember (all the examples were in Pascal) than I ever got out of
the manpages.)</p>
<p>The people who insist that the manpages are all you need will
sometimes dismiss guide-type documentation as tedious to work through;
they’d rather learn things from a reference, they say, because that way
they can jump around in it and look for the specific bits that are
relevant to them right now. And that’s fine—if they’re right that the
stuff they’re skipping over <em>isn’t</em> relevant to them. But it also
has negative practical consequences.</p>
<p>If you are in the habit of reading only the bits of the
documentation, whatever documentation you have, that you think are
relevant right now, you’re liable to come away with a mental model
that’s only vaguely accurate; possibly dangerously <em>in</em>‌accurate
in places. (I think this is a lot of why the user commentary at the
bottom of the online PHP documentation is so full of bad advice.) And,
if you are only interested in reference documentation yourself, you’re
probably not going to try to <em>write</em> guides for the software you
yourself write. (This is how we get monstrosities like the Git
documentation, that are <em>only</em> of any use to someone who already
knows how it works and just needs a bit of a reminder.)</p>
<p>Furthermore—this isn’t just about bad documentation. When experts
repeat inaccurate stories about how <em>we</em> learned to code, we’re
setting the next generation of hackers up to <em>fail</em> to learn to
code. The <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/">Jargon File</a>,
which records how the generation of programmers <em>before</em> mine
thought they learned to code, holds up the experience of devoting all of
your free time to learning computers as <em>necessary</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/L/larval-stage.html">larval
stage</a> <em>n.</em> Describes a period of monomaniacal concentration
on coding apparently passed through by all fledgling hackers…the ordeal
seems to be necessary to produce really wizardly (as opposed to merely
competent) programmers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may have <em>seemed</em> to be true when it was written
(although I believe I smell a variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment">sunk cost
fallacy</a> at work) but it doesn’t leave any room for people who don’t
learn things by monomaniacally concentrating on them. (This is not the
only place where the Jargon File’s authors failed to imagine how people
whose brains worked differently than theirs could be any good at
computers.) I’m pretty confident that someone who practices programming
strictly as a hobby, less than ten hours a week, will eventually get
just as good at it as one of these <q>fledgling hackers</q> who doesn’t
do anything else with their spare time. And, if we <em>tell</em> people
that, they won’t get put off the subject by the unappetizing prospect of
not getting to hang out with friends on the weekends.</p>
