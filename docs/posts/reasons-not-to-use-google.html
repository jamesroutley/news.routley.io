<h2 id="nonfree-software">Nonfree software required</h2>

A nonfree program submits the users to the power of the program&#39;s
developer.  This is an <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">injustice
to the user</a>.  Alas, most Google services require running nonfree
code.

<ul>
  <li>
    *Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Microsoft are <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/amazon-google-and-microsoft-sued-over-photos-in-facial-recognition-database/">being sued</a> over imagesused to train their facial recognition technologies.*
  </li>

<li id="js">
In general, most Google services require
running <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">
nonfree Javascript code</a>.  If you refuse to run that (for instance,
by running LibreJS), you&#39;ll see that you should not use those
services.
</li>

<li>
Even making a Google account requires running nonfree Javascript software
sent by the site.
</li>

<li>
Google Groups and Google+ Communities require the use of <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
Javascript software</a>, so please don&#39;t host your discussions there.
</li>

<li>
Google Docs requires <a href="https://gnu.org/philosophy/javascript-trap.html">nonfree
Javascript code</a> to edit a document, or even to look at one with
the usual URL.  IceCat comes with an add-on that permits read-only
access to some documents on Google Docs.
</li>

<li>
<p>
Around 2011, Google Maps worked without running Javascript code.  Then
something broke: the page worked fine except that the map did not
appear.
</p><p>
Nowadays, nothing whatsoever appears if Javascript is disabled.
</p></li>

<li id="youtube">
Youtube.com
requires <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/whats-wrong-with-youtube.html">nonfree
software (Javascript code) for normal use of the site</a>; after
changes Google made in August 2017, <em>nothing</em> is visible in a
typical Youtube page without running its nonfree Javascript code.

<p>For my own freedom&#39;s sake, I do not run the nonfree Javascript
software sent by Youtube.  I advise you to refuse likewise; what&#39;s
directly at stake is your own freedom.

</p><p>At present, there is a Firefox add-on to bypass that Javascript
code.  IceCat comes with that add-on by default.  Youtube blocks
access by Tor most of the time, but you can work around that by
visiting one of the special Youtube-access sites which are offshoots
of invidio.us.  But we can&#39;t count on Google to let those methods
continue to function.

</p><p>To avoid leading other people astray, please don&#39;t refer to videos
on Youtube.  Although it is true that they could bypass the problem by
as described above, I expect most users would view the Youtube page in
their browsers with nonfree software.  Let&#39;s not encourage that.

</p><p>However, it is ok to refer to the same videos on an offshoot of
invidio.us; just make sure not to choose one that is &#34;protected&#34; by
Cloudflare, since that sends its own nonfree software.  This way of
referring is probably fail-safe: it may cease to work, but it will
probably not start leading people to run nonfree software.

</p><p>You don&#39;t need a special &#34;platform&#34; to post an audio or video on
the Web.  You can post an audio or video file on any web site.  Just
put up the WebM file and link to it as if it were an ordinary page.
All graphical browsers can handle that.

<li>Google censored installation of Samsung&#39;s <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/03/google-pulls-ad-blocking-app-for-samsung-phones">ad-blocker,</a> saying that blocking ads is &#34;interference&#34; with the sites that advertise (and surveil users through ads).

<p>The ad-blocker is proprietary software, just like the program
(Google Play) that Google used to deny access to install it.  I would
refuse to have either of them on my
computer.  <a href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html">Using
a nonfree program</a> gives the owner power over you, and Google has
exercised that power.
</p></li>

</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 id="surveillance">Surveillance</h2>

To identify yourself to a Google service is a grave error.

<ul>

  <li>
    Google <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/05/google-gmail-purchase-history-cant-be-deleted.html">stores
    a list of all purchases</a> a user has made that in any
    way
    mention the user&#39;s a gmail account.
    A user can delete purchases from this list, but only one purchase at
    a time.  Then that purchase disappears from the list that the user
    sees.
    Whether it remains in another list, we do not know, but I&#39;d expect
    Google to answer that question with doubletalk.
    <p>
      The article talks about what Google cites as its motive for doing
    this,
      but the motive is irrelevant — because it&#39;s not an excuse.
  </p></li>

<li>
  Google&#39;s alarm system, &#34;Nest Secure&#34;, turns out to have contained a
  microphone all along — but only 
  <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3336227/security/nest-secure-had-a-secret-microphone-can-now-be-a-google-assistant.html">recently
  started listening</a>.
  </li>

<li>
<p>
Google &#34;sanitizes&#34; its total search logs, then publishes them; but it
declines to describe the process of &#34;sanitization&#34;, and there
<a href="http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&amp;context=jpc">is
evidence that users can be tracked through them</a>.</p>
<p>
The article also mentions two-factor authentication, which in and of
itself could be a useful technique (though I&#39;ve read that crackers can
now defeat it), but has the flaw of requiring a mobile phone.  My rule
#2 for digital security is not to have a mobile phone.</p>
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.alternet.org/google-using-gmail-build-psychological-profiles-hundreds-millions-people?paging=off">Gmail</a>
was planned from the start as a massive surveillance system, to make
psychological profiles not only of Gmail users but of everyone who
sends mail to Gmail users.
</li>

<li>
Google quietly
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/21/how-to-disable-google-ad-tracking-gmail-youtube-browser-history">
combined its ad-tracking profiles with its browsing profiles.
</a>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Google has found a way to 
<a href="https://consumerist.com/2017/05/23/google-following-your-offline-credit-card-spending-to-tell-advertisers-if-their-ads-work/">track
most credit card purchases in the US</a>, even those not done through
a phone, and correlate that with people&#39;s online actions.</p>
<p>
Google can&#39;t do either side to me, since I pay cash and don&#39;t carry a
mobile phone, and it doesn&#39;t know what web sites I look at.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Google Play 
<a href="http://gadgets.ndtv.com/apps/news/google-play-store-policy-raises-privacy-concerns-331116">sends
app developers the personal details of users that install the app</a>.
</p><p>
Merely asking users&#39; &#34;consent&#34; for this is not enough to legitimize it.
We know that most users have given up on reading just what they are
&#34;consenting&#34; to, and the reason is that they are accustomed to being
told, &#34;If you want to use this service, you must consent to blah blah
blah.&#34;
</p><p>
To truly protect people&#39;s privacy, we must stop Google from getting
this personal information in the first place!
</p></li>

<li>
<p>
Google <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/28/all-the-data-facebook-google-has-on-you-privacy">
stores a huge amount of data</a> on each user. This can include, in
addition to the user&#39;s search history and advertising
profile:
</p><ul>
  <li>A timeline of the user&#39;s location throughout each
    day</li>
  <li>Data on the usage of non-Google phone
    apps</li>
  <li>&#39;Deleted&#39; emails and files uploaded to Google
    Drive</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Facebook and Google joined with ISPs to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20180412/13203739616/public-attention-forces-facebook-to-retreat-anti-privacy-alliance-with-isps-california.shtml">defeat a privacy initiative</a>
in California.
</p></li>

<li>
<p>
Collecting the many ways Google is involved with US government
surveillance, abroad and in the US, amounts
to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/20/googles-earth-how-the-tech-giant-is-helping-the-state-spy-on-us">quite
a package</a>.
</p>
</li>

<li <p="">
Google invites people to let Google <a href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2019/02/04/google-screenwise-unwise-trade-all-your-privacy-cash?cd-origin=rss">monitor their phone use</a>, and all
internet use in their homes, for an extravagant payment of $20.

<p>
This is not a malicious functionality of a program with some other
purpose; this is the software&#39;s sole purpose, and Google says so.  But
Google says it in a way that encourages most people to ignore the
details and remain unaware of the extent of the spying.  Anyway, mere
consent does not legitimize massive surveillance.
</p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Amazon and Google want &#34;smart&#34; gadgets
    to <a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/onweb/your-smart-light-can-tell-amazon-and-google-when-you-go-to-bed">report
    all activity to them</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, if you have a &#34;smart&#34; (read &#34;spy&#34;) lightbulb with
    that proposed feature, and tell an Amazon or Google listening
    device about it, thenceforth any time you switched it on or
    off <em>no matter how</em>, it would send a report to Amazon or
    Google.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even today, the only way to make &#34;smart&#34; products safe is to
    ensure they cannot connect to anyone else&#39;s systems.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>
    Another piece of Google&#39;s surveillance capitalism: when stores
    mail receipts to a gmail.com account, Google figures out
    and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/google-gmail-tracks-purchase-history-how-to-delete-it.html">records
    who bought what</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I think that the store itself should not get this information,
    which is why I always pay cash and never give my name.
  </p>
</li>

<li>
  <p>*Google faces lawsuit <a href="https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKCN24F2N4?_">over tracking in apps even when users opted out</a>.*</p>
</li>

</ul>
<hr/>

<h2 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/17/google-suspends-customer-accounts-for-reselling-pixel-phones">
Google cuts off accounts</a> for users that resell Pixel phones.
They lose access to all of their mail and documents stored
in Google servers under that account.
<p>
It should be illegal to put any &#34;terms of service&#34; on a physical
product.  It should also be illegal to close an account on a service
without letting the user download whatever was stored there.
</p><p>
These events provide another reason why schools must never ask
a student to use a service account linked to the student&#39;s name.
</p></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="censorship">Censorship</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Amazon and
    Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17308508/amazon-web-services-signal-domain-fronting-ban-response">have
      cut off domain-fronting</a>, a feature

<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/pakistans-youtube-ban-lifted-as-government-gets-say-over-content">agreed
to perform special censorship of Youtube</a> for the government of
Pakistan, deleting views that the state opposes.
<p>
This will help the illiberal Pakistani state
<a href="http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/001146.html">suppress

Google shut off Alexa O&#39;Brien&#39;s Google Drive account, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/journalist-nearly-banned-from-youtube-and-gmail-for-pos-1815314182">denying her
access</a> to it, because her reporting on Chelsea Manning&#39;s trial
included copies of al-Qa&#39;ida propaganda that was presented as evidence.

<p>Google is deleting porn artists&#39; porn videos <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/9kgwnp/porn-on-google-drive-error">from their own private accounts, quietly and mysteriously</a>.</p>
<p>Never trust a remote storage company to keep anything but a spare
backup copy.  When you store that, put your files into an archive and
encrypt it so that the company can&#39;t tell what&#39;s in them — not
even their file names.</p>

<p>
Vox lawyers got Youtube
to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/02/the-verge-briefly-censored-youtubers-who-mocked-its-bad-pc-building-advice/">take
down criticisms</a> of a video published by Vox, and threaten the
critics with punishment, too.
</p>
<p>
The videos were almost surely fair use, but Youtube decided against
the critics anyway.  This shows how Youtube&#39;s general submission to
the copyright industry constrict&#39;s people&#39;s rights.
