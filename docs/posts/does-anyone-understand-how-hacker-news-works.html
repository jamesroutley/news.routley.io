    <h1>Ask HN: Does anyone understand how Hacker News works?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>When working on my projects and talking to investors, I often hear:
“Just post it on Hacker News or Reddit and show that people love it.”</p><p>What I find strange is that Hacker News feels oddly opaque. I’ve never met anyone who can clearly explain how it works in practice. Not just the rules, but the dynamics: what’s repeatable, what’s luck, and what actually matters.</p><p>By using the Kevin Bacon-number idea: I can usually get within three degrees of separation of well-known technologists like Linus Torvalds, but I can’t seem to get within three steps of someone who confidently understands how HN works.</p><p>So I’m asking sincerely:
Does anyone here feel they understand Hacker News?
If so, what are the real levers, and what do people consistently misunderstand?</p><p>PS: This question comes from a mix of genuine curiosity and personal frustration. I’m honestly trying to understand how HN works in practice.</p></div></div></div>
