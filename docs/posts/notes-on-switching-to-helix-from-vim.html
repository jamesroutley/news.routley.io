    <h1>Notes on switching to Helix from vim</h1>
    
    <p>Hello! Earlier this summer I was talking to a friend about how much I
<a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/09/12/reasons-i--still--love-fish/">love using fish</a>, and
how I love that I don&rsquo;t have to configure it. They said that they feel the same
way about the <a href="https://helix-editor.com/">helix</a> text editor, and so I decided
to give it a try.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it for 3 months now and here are a few notes.</p>
<h3 id="why-helix-language-servers">why helix: language servers</h3>
<p>I think what motivated me to try Helix is that I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a working
language server setup (so I can do things like &ldquo;go to definition&rdquo;) and getting
a setup that feels good in Vim or Neovim just felt like too much work.</p>
<p>After using Vim/Neovim for 20 years, I&rsquo;ve tried both &ldquo;build my own custom
configuration from scratch&rdquo; and &ldquo;use someone else&rsquo;s pre-buld configuration
system&rdquo; and even though I love Vim I was excited about having things just work
without having to work on my configuration at all.</p>
<p>Helix comes with built in language server support, and it feels nice
to be able to do things like &ldquo;rename this symbol&rdquo; in any language.</p>
<h3 id="the-search-is-great">the search is great</h3>
<p>One of my favourite things about Helix is the search! If I&rsquo;m searching all the
files in my repository for a string, it lets me scroll through the potential
matching files and see the full context of the match, like this:</p>
<img src="/images/helix-search.png">
<p>For comparison, here&rsquo;s what the vim ripgrep plugin I&rsquo;ve been using looks like:</p>
<img src="/images/vim-ripgrep.png">
<p>There&rsquo;s no context for what else is around that line.</p>
<h3 id="the-quick-reference-is-nice">the quick reference is nice</h3>
<p>One thing I like about Helix is that when I press <code>g</code>, I get a little help popup
telling me places I can go. I really appreciate this because I don&rsquo;t often use
the &ldquo;go to definition&rdquo; or &ldquo;go to reference&rdquo; feature and I often forget the
keyboard shortcut.</p>

<h3 id="some-vim-helix-translations">some vim -&gt; helix translations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t have marks like <code>ma</code>, <code>'a</code>, instead I&rsquo;ve been using <code>Ctrl+O</code> and
<code>Ctrl+I</code> to go back (or forward) to the last cursor location</li>
<li>I think Helix does have macros, but I&rsquo;ve been using multiple cursors in every
case that I would have previously used a macro. I like multiple cursors a lot
more than writing macros all the time. If I want to batch change something in
the document, my workflow is to press <code>%</code> (to highlight everything), then <code>s</code>
to select (with a regex) the things I want to change, then I can just edit
all of them as needed.</li>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t have neovim-style tabs, instead it has a nice buffer switcher (<code>&lt;space&gt;b</code>)
I can use to switch to the buffer I want. There&rsquo;s a
<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/7109">pull request here</a> to implement neovim-style tabs.
There&rsquo;s also a setting <code>bufferline=&quot;multiple&quot;</code> which can act a bit like tabs
with <code>gp</code>, <code>gn</code> for prev/next &ldquo;tab&rdquo; and <code>:bc</code> to close a &ldquo;tab&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-helix-annoyances">some helix annoyances</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s everything that&rsquo;s annoyed me about Helix so far.</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the way Helix&rsquo;s <code>:reflow</code> works much less than how
vim reflows text with <code>gq</code>. It doesn&rsquo;t work as well with lists. (<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/3332">github issue</a>)</li>
<li>If I&rsquo;m making a Markdown list, pressing &ldquo;enter&rdquo; at the end of a list item
won&rsquo;t continue the list. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/wiki/Recipes#continue-markdown-lists--quotes">partial workaround</a>
for bulleted lists but I don&rsquo;t know one for numbered lists.</li>
<li>No persistent undo yet: in vim I could use an
<a href="https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'undofile'">undofile</a> so
that I could undo changes even after quitting. Helix doesn&rsquo;t have that feature yet.
(<a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/pull/9154">github PR</a>)</li>
<li>Helix doesn&rsquo;t autoreload files after they change on disk, I have to run
<code>:reload-all</code> (<code>:ra&lt;tab&gt;</code>) to manually reload them. Not a big deal.</li>
<li>Sometimes it crashes, maybe every week or so.
Someone mentioned that this might have something to do with the fact that I
edit a lot of Markdown, not sure. This doesn&rsquo;t bother me that much though, I
can just reopen it. I&rsquo;m not 100% sure whether the crash is a segfault or a panic,
but it seems that Helix can <a href="https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/issues/6981">segfault sometimes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The &ldquo;markdown list&rdquo; and reflowing issues come up a lot for me because I spend
a lot of time editing Markdown lists, but I keep using Helix anyway so I guess
they can&rsquo;t be making me that mad.</p>
<h3 id="switching-was-easier-than-i-thought">switching was easier than I thought</h3>
<p>I was worried that relearning 20 years of Vim muscle memory would be really hard.</p>
<p>It turned out to be easier than I expected, I started using Helix on a
vacation for a little low-stakes coding project I was doing on the side and
after a week or two it didn&rsquo;t feel so disorienting anymore. I think it might be
hard to switch back and forth between Vim and Helix, but I haven&rsquo;t needed to use
Vim recently so I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;ll ever become an issue for me.</p>
<p>The first time I tried Helix I tried to force it to use keybindings that were
more similar to Vim and that did not work for me. Just learning the &ldquo;Helix way&rdquo;
was a lot easier.</p>
<p>There are still some things that throw me off: for example <code>w</code> in vim and <code>w</code> in
Helix don&rsquo;t have the same idea of what a &ldquo;word&rdquo; is (the Helix one includes the
space after the word, the Vim one doesn&rsquo;t).</p>
<h3 id="using-a-terminal-based-text-editor">using a terminal-based text editor</h3>
<p>For many years I&rsquo;d mostly been using a GUI version of vim/neovim, so switching
to actually using an editor in the terminal was a bit of an adjustment.</p>
<p>I ended up deciding on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Every project gets its own terminal window, and all of the tabs in that
window (mostly) have the same working directory</li>
<li>I make my Helix tab the first tab in the terminal window</li>
</ol>
<p>It works pretty well, I might actually like it better than my previous workflow.</p>
<h3 id="my-configuration">my configuration</h3>
<p>I appreciate that my configuration is really simple, compared to my neovim
configuration which is hundreds of lines. It&rsquo;s mostly just 4 keyboard
shortcuts.</p>
<pre><code>theme = &quot;solarized_light&quot;
[editor]
# Sync clipboard with system clipboard
default-yank-register = &quot;+&quot;

[keys.normal]
# I didn't like that Ctrl+C was the default &quot;toggle comments&quot; shortcut
&quot;#&quot; = &quot;toggle_comments&quot;

# I didn't feel like learning a different way
# to go to the beginning/end of a line so
# I remapped ^ and $
&quot;^&quot; = &quot;goto_first_nonwhitespace&quot;
&quot;$&quot; = &quot;goto_line_end&quot;

[keys.select]
&quot;^&quot; = &quot;goto_first_nonwhitespace&quot;
&quot;$&quot; = &quot;goto_line_end&quot;

[keys.normal.space]
# I write a lot of text so I need to constantly reflow,
# and missed vim's `gq` shortcut
l = &quot;:reflow&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>There&rsquo;s a separate <code>languages.toml</code> configuration where I set some language
preferences, like turning off autoformatting.
For example, here&rsquo;s my Python configuration:</p>
<pre><code>[[language]]
name = &quot;python&quot;
formatter = { command = &quot;black&quot;, args = [&quot;--stdin-filename&quot;, &quot;%{buffer_name}&quot;, &quot;-&quot;] }
language-servers = [&quot;pyright&quot;]
auto-format = false
</code></pre>
<h3 id="we-ll-see-how-it-goes">we&rsquo;ll see how it goes</h3>
<p>Three months is not that long, and it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;ll decide to go back
to Vim at some point. For example, I wrote a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/28/some-notes-on-using-nix/">post about switching to
nix</a> a while back but
after maybe 8 months I switched back to Homebrew (though I&rsquo;m still using NixOS
to manage one little server, and I&rsquo;m still satisfied with that).</p>
