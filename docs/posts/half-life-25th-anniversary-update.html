                            <p>Originally released as a CD exclusive for magazines and hardware manufacturers, this mini-campaign was built by the Half-Life team right after the game went gold. As this was many people&#39;s first experience with Half-Life, we thought it was finally time to bundle it with the main game—no sound card purchase necessary.</p>

                            <p>Built by Valve level designers, these new maps push the limits of what&#39;s possible in the Half-Life engine.</p>

                                    <p>Two-foot-thick steel doors block off access to this contaminated waste facility, which has questionable scientific goals at best. Strap on a gluon gun and roast all intruders.</p>

                                    <p>Enjoy a relaxing stay at this abandoned Xen outpost built around a cluster of soothing healing pools free-floating in space. How do you breathe here? It doesn&#39;t matter!</p>

                                    <p>Processing Area 3, a massive radioactive waste plant gone quiet. Tons of room for you and your colleagues to do experiments with a Tau Cannon or some hand grenades.</p>
                                </div>

                                    <p>The creaking weight of this decaying orbital satellite launch facility somehow feels familiar… If we could switch on the oxygen lines, power, and fuel, we might just be able to light this candle.</p>

                                <li>We now consider this anniversary version of Half Life to be the definitive version, and the one we&#39;ll continue to support going forward. Therefore, we&#39;ll be reducing the visibility of Half Life: Source on the Steam Store. We know Half-Life: Source&#39;s assets are still being used by the Source engine community, so it&#39;ll remain available, but we&#39;ll be encouraging new Half-Life players to play this version instead.</li>
