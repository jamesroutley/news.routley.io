Also, unlike the heart, the </span><a href="https://www.eophtha.com/posts/anatomy-of-lens" rel="">lens of the human eye</a><span> has no blood vessels, no nerves, and no interaction with the immune system, meaning it cannot absorb medicines, respond to immune signals, or recover from structural injury.</span></p><p>Throughout much of history, then, when an eye was damaged, there was little that could be done to heal it. And even today, ophthalmologists like myself struggle to address the idiosyncrasies of this organ when treating ocular and vision disorders.</p><p><span>And such disorders are rampant: In 2020, an estimated </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(20)30488-5/fulltext" rel="">596 million people</a><span> had distance vision impairment worldwide, of whom 43 million were blind. While the cause for blindness varies — cataracts (17.01 million cases), glaucoma (3.61 million cases), trachoma</span><span> (1.9 million cases), age-related degeneration (1.85 million cases), and more — these diseases have enormous implications for health and economic development when taken together. Some of these problems, like age-related macular degeneration, remain difficult to treat, but others, such as cataracts, have ready and cost-effective interventions.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N0RM!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N0RM!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N0RM!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N0RM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N0RM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N0RM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg" width="1456" height="1275" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1275,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:6395996,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.asimov.press/i/172351100?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N0RM!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N0RM!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N0RM!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!N0RM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F69f7af76-ada3-43e0-b101-c5db2e814d63_3158x2766.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a><figcaption><span>An Egyptian sculpture depicting the Eye of Horus, from the San Diego Museum of Man.

So while it is tempting to champion cataract surgery as one of medicine’s most enduring and continually refined surgical interventions (today the surgery takes around 20 minutes and has a success rate </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559253/" rel="">above 95 percent</a><span>), it is not yet a wholesale success story.

In classical Latin, cataracta could also denote a “portcullis,” a heavy gate that blocks passage; apt symbolism for the visual obstruction caused by the condition.</span></p><p><span>The first explicit mention of cataracts as a distinct and treatable pathology comes from the Sushruta Samhita, composed circa 600 BCE.

Crucially, this procedure merely shifted the cataract away from the pupil to allow light into the eye, temporarily restoring limited sight without actually removing the cataract.

His technique made use of a hollow needle of his own design, which he used to suck out the cataract.</span></p><p>His innovation marked a distinct conceptual evolution: the lens was no longer a part of the eye to be pushed aside, but a pathological entity requiring removal.</p><p><span>Although extractions had become more prevalent in the Islamic world, couching remained the primary cataract treatment in Europe. But in 1747, </span><a href="https://books.google.co.in/books?id=v0oL8xDJ0VEC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="">Jacques Daviel, a French military surgeon</a><span>, introduced a completely new approach — extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). In it, Daviel made a precise incision near the limbus of the eye, the border between the cornea and the white part of the eye. Then he opened up the anterior capsule (front covering) of the lens, and carefully extracted the opaque material while preserving the posterior capsule (back covering) of the lens.</span></p><p>To appreciate the significance of this approach, it is important to understand the anatomy involved. During cataract surgery, the cloudy lens rests in front of the vitreous body, a clear, jelly-like substance filling most of the eye. The retina, responsible for vision, attaches to the back of the eye, behind the vitreous. If the posterior capsule is broken, the vitreous can move forward and disturb the delicate retina, increasing the risk of vision loss. By keeping the posterior capsule intact, the surgeon preserved both the vitreous and the posterior chamber, the space just behind the lens, thereby maintaining the eye’s natural structure and function. Daviel’s preservation of the posterior capsule is still followed in cataract operations today.</p><p><span>As with many medical revolutions, however, progress was not linear. Just three years later, in 1750, a British surgeon named </span><a href="https://jfophth.com/evolution-of-cataract-surgery/" rel="">Samuel Sharp</a><span> proposed yet another method, called </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1692229/?page=21" rel="">intracapsular cataract extraction</a><span> (ICCE). In this technique, the </span><em>entire</em><span> lens, including the lens capsule (a thin, elastic membrane that holds the lens in place), is removed from the eye. Sharp used a corneal knife to make an incision and then compressed the eyeball with his thumb to expel the intact lens, without opening the capsule.</span></p><p><span>Sharp’s method was mechanically simpler than Daviel’s.

In his account to the Royal Society, Sharp conceded that, of all 19 operations, “There was not one [patient] that escaped inflammation.” He was also forthright about his mistakes, such as when he accidentally nicked a patient’s iris, “which bled profusely” (though he was </span><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstl.1753.0050" rel="">careful to note</a><span> that Daviel hadn’t observed any poor outcomes from such an error). He even ends with the admission: “I presume a greater number of operations will prove this account very deficient, but I have here communicated all that I have done … It is to be hoped that, when it shall be more generally practiced, ingenious men will render it still more perfect.”</span></p><p>Perhaps the largest “deficiency” of both Daviel and Sharp’s techniques was that patients who underwent them were left “aphakic,” with their natural lens gone and their vision blurred. With the help of thick convex spectacles, their sight was often clearer than it would have been with couching, but these glasses were bulky and still left the wearer with distorted sight and limited peripheral vision.</p><p><span>The lens, after all, plays a central role in vision by bending and focusing light. If it’s removed without being replaced, the eye loses its focusing power (communicated in “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dioptre" rel="">diopters</a><span>,” a measurement of how strongly a lens refracts light). Without lenses, then, a person’s vision might drop by as much as 20 diopters, leaving them horrendously farsighted.</span></p><p>So while Daviel and Sharp recognized the importance of actually removing cataracts, they had not yet hit upon a means of replacement.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mUss!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mUss!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mUss!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mUss!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mUss!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mUss!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg" width="1456" height="1241" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1241,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:4046398,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.asimov.press/i/172351100?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mUss!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mUss!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mUss!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!mUss!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6561129e-bc26-445e-9466-f6772159bc79_3556x3031.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a><figcaption>Knives used for cataract operations, including those used by Daviel.

London.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>The next step was to test this lens in a patient. Ridley sought one with a cataract in a single eye but with functional vision in the other so that, should the IOL implantation fail, their quality of life would not be severely impacted. It took almost a year before Ridley </span><a href="https://journals.lww.com/kjop/fulltext/2020/32030/sir_harold_ridley_and_the_intraocular_foreign_body.21.aspx" rel="">found Elizabeth Attfield,</a><span> a 45-year-old hospital nurse with a cataract in just her left eye.</span></p><p><span>For the operation, Rayner and Keeler manufactured a simple disc-shaped lens with a peripheral groove from the specially prepared Perspex CQ, providing it to Ridley at a cost of just eighteen shillings (about £38 today). On November 29, 1949, Ridley performed an extracapsular cataract extraction on Attfield. He then </span><a href="https://rayner.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/12/Invention_of_the_IOL.pdf" rel="">waited three months</a><span> to ensure the eye had tolerated the extraction before implanting the first IOL, which he carefully placed behind the iris onto the front of the posterior capsule.</span></p><p><span>The outcome of this first surgery was mixed. Attfield&#39;s central visual acuity improved to 20/60,</span><span> but her vision shifted -14 diopters. This shift happened because the implanted lens design was a bit too thick. As such, it did not account for the difference in refractive index — how much a material bends light — between the artificial lens and her natural lens, causing a refractive error.</span></p><p>An implantation on a second patient in August 1950 resulted in a change of –15 diopters. After modifying the curvature of the artificial lens surface, which determines its focusing power, Ridley’s third IOL in November 1950 achieved a much more acceptable result of +4.5 diopters, closely matching the patient’s other eye.</p><p><span>In Ridley’s early surgeries, </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1323886/?page=7" rel="">no suture was used</a><span> to hold the eye structures in place, and part of the iris, the colored portion of the eye that controls pupil size, slipped out through the surgical incision, a complication known as iris prolapse. Ridley corrected this in later procedures by adding a corner stitch to keep the chamber stable. In another case, the lens shifted downward inside the eye because it was too heavy and lacked proper support. This drove Ridley to create a lighter lens.</span></p><p>Ridley waited for 18 months after his first IOL implantation before presenting his findings, hoping to showcase two-year follow-up results to prove the procedure’s safety and efficacy. However, an unexpected coincidence forced his hand. One of his patients, consulting the telephone directory for his post-operative visit, found a “Dr. Ridley” listed, made an appointment, and arrived at the address, only to discover he was at the office of Dr. Frederick Ridley, a different ophthalmologist. After this encounter, the news quickly spread.</p><p><span>In July 1951, Ridley </span><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsbm.2007.0022?download=true" rel="">presented his work</a><span> on IOLs at the Oxford Ophthalmological Congress, held at the School of Geology (with rooms at Frewin Hall for “lady ophthalmologists”). Though Ridley presented his results sooner than he would have liked, he had by that time performed IOL implantation in eight patients. He brought two of his most successful patients along as evidence of his triumph, one with vision restored to 20/20 (considered the normal standard) and the other achieving 20/15, even better.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!930p!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!930p!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!930p!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!930p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!930p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!930p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg" width="1456" height="752" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:752,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:634905,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.asimov.press/i/172351100?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null,&#34;offset&#34;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!930p!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!930p!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!930p!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!930p!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F792de502-96d2-4cc8-b9f9-939d098d65d6_5847x3020.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture><div><div></div></div></div></a><figcaption>Placement of an intraocular lens into the eye after cataract removal.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Despite a smattering of polite applause and a few questions, Ridley’s presentation quickly turned sour. Notably, </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12187139/" rel="">Sir Stewart Duke-Elder, the doyen of British ophthalmology</a><span>, refused even to examine Ridley’s patients, citing the absence of preclinical animal trials and the experimental nature of the procedure. There may have also been a layer of professional jealousy, as Duke-Elder had also been working at the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London and even attended to some of the same patients before passing them off to Ridley. One of Ridley’s biographers, David Apple, </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/David_J_Apple_Sir_Harold_Ridley_and_His_Fight_for?id=tMVSVumHzHUC" rel="">observed that he must have felt foolish</a><span>:</span></p><blockquote><p>“There he was, the greatest and most influential of all British ophthalmologists, the ‘ophthalmic Aladdin’ as he was sometimes called.

It didn’t come from war or a surgical textbook but a dentist’s chair. </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844025012939" rel="">Charles D. Kelman, an American ophthalmologist</a><span>, was undergoing a dental cleaning involving ultrasonic instruments designed to remove plaque with minimal mechanical force. Incidentally, Kelman was only at the dentist because he was so despondent about failed attempts</span><span> to improve cataract surgery that he had let </span><a href="https://crstodayeurope.com/articles/2006-sep/0906_14-php/" rel="">himself fall to pieces</a><span>: “I had, meanwhile, allowed my hair to grow down to my shoulders, and my teeth badly needed a cleaning.”</span></p><p>The hum of this scaler sparked an idea that would propel cataract surgery into its modern form: What if, he thought, a cataract could be emulsified — broken into tiny particles to be more easily removed from the eye? This would minimize trauma to the eye, speed up recovery, and reduce postoperative complications.</p><p><span>His </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11225641/" rel="">first device</a><span>, made by the ultrasonic scaling device company Cavitron Corporation, was rudimentary but serviceable. It consisted of a large boxy unit that housed the machine components, and a wand-like instrument that the surgeon would grip like a pencil. At the tip of this handpiece was an ultrasonic probe much like the one the dentist had been using.</span></p><p><span>By 1967, after conducting animal trials, Dr. Charles Kelman was ready to test his “phacoemulsification machine” on a blind patient, who elected to undergo the surgery voluntarily. The operation took more than </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736(04)16646-4" rel="">four hours to complete</a><span>, with the ultrasound step alone lasting sixty-one minutes. The earliest “phaco handpiece” was </span><a href="https://crstodayeurope.com/articles/2013-sep/from-music-to-medicine/#:~:text=However,%20by%201967,%20Charlie%20felt,a%20contractual%20arrangement%20with%20Cavitron." rel="">much heavier</a><span> than today’s versions, making the operation tiring and difficult to control. Unfortunately, the patient’s eye became infected after surgery and had to be </span><a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2804%2916646-4" rel="">removed</a><span>. In fact, Kelman’s earliest attempts were </span><a href="https://journals.lww.com/tnoa/fulltext/2018/56010/remembering_dr__charles_d__kelman_and_development.17.aspx" rel="">fraught with such complications</a><span>, and he spent two years seeking a way to prevent corneal collapse.</span></p><p><span>But Kelman persisted. He refined his instrumentation, collaborated with engineers to create safer, more efficient phaco tips,</span><span> and meticulously documented his clinical outcomes. By 1970, he felt confident enough to train other surgeons in his improved technique, organizing courses in New York. His new methods drastically reduced the size of the surgical wound from </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11056193/" rel="">10 to 12 millimeters</a><span> to </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK576419/" rel="">under 3 millimeters</a><span>. This meant fewer stitches, reducing induced astigmatism and enabling earlier visual rehabilitation.</span></p><p><span>Throughout the 1980s and 90s, advances in ultrasound tip design, fluidics control, and foldable intraocular lenses</span><span> made phacoemulsification even safer and less invasive, allowing much smaller incisions that no longer required sutures. The 2000s brought refinements in torsional and transverse ultrasound (which emulsify the lens more efficiently with less heat),</span><span> and the integration of real-time computer control for stability and precision. </span></p><p><span>By the 21st century, the field had fully entered its precision era, marked by the introduction of laser surgery. In 2008, Hungarian ophthalmologist </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4655462/" rel="">Zoltan Nagy</a><span> performed the world’s first Femtosecond-Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery (FLACS) procedure using a </span><a href="https://crstodayeurope.com/articles/2009-sep/0909_06-php/" rel="">femtosecond laser</a><span>, a specialized surgical instrument that emits ultrashort pulses of light.</span><span> While used in operations, more traditional means of phacoemulsification remain standard practice.</span></p><p><span>Today, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLSKmeAV43M" rel="">cataract surgery begins</a><span> with the patient receiving topical anesthetic eye drops or a small amount of local anesthetic around the eye. Next, the surgeon creates a tiny incision in the cornea, only about 2-3 millimeters wide. It is through this incision that phacoemulsification takes place as surgeons insert an ultrasonic probe that vibrates at an astonishing rate of </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK576419/" rel="">40,000 times per second</a><span>. The cataract is broken into tiny fragments and washed out of the eye with irrigation and suction, leaving behind the clear capsular bag that originally held the natural lens.</span></p><p><span>With the structure of the bag preserved thanks to surgical techniques from the likes of Daviel, the next step is the placement of an IOL. Modern IOLs are foldable, allowing the surgeon to insert them through the same small incision used in the phacoemulsification stage using a special injector. Once inside the eye, the lens unfolds neatly into the capsular bag. The </span><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/treatment-tests-and-therapies/cataract-surgery" rel="">whole process takes about 20 minutes</a><span>, and most patients experience improved vision within hours to days, with full healing typically complete within 4-6 weeks.</span></p><div id="youtube2-lrg3qsvjvdc" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;lrg3qsvjvdc&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:&#34;45&#34;,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lrg3qsvjvdc?start=45&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>There is variation, of course, with some surgeries using slightly different phacoemulsification techniques such as FLACS or different IOL designs. For example, a type of IOL known as “light-adjustable lenses” (LALs) can </span><a href="https://europe.ophthalmologytimes.com/view/adjustable-intraocular-lenses-after-cataract-surgery-0" rel="">be fine-tuned after surgery using ultraviolet light</a><span>. They are made from a special photosensitive silicone polymer containing light-reactive macromers (essentially small chains of molecules with “loose ends” capable of linking up with other chains when triggered). After surgery, when the eye has stabilized, the patient sits at a slit-lamp–mounted device that shines targeted UV light (of around 365 nm) onto the IOL.

Today, it is one of the largest eye care providers in the world, with a network of 14 hospitals across South India.

Roughly half its patients pay market rates for care, which subsidizes free or at-cost services for the other half. Reducing costs beyond the surgery itself has been just as important. </span></p><p><span>For example, Aravind identified that the cost of IOLs (usually around </span><a href="https://www.aao.org/young-ophthalmologists/yo-info/article/aurolab-india-revolution-affordable-eye-care-one" rel="">$100 per lens</a><span>) presented a significant barrier in low-resource settings. To overcome this, Aravind began to manufacture its own. The result was Aurolab, a manufacturer established in 1992, which reduced the price of each lens to below </span><a href="https://www.aao.org/young-ophthalmologists/yo-info/article/aurolab-india-revolution-affordable-eye-care-one" rel="">U.S. $10</a><span>. Clinically, these lenses match the </span><a href="https://www.aurolab.com/products/category/iol" rel="">safety and optical quality of imported versions</a><span>, the main difference being that they are rigid PMMA lenses rather than the foldable acrylic ones used in high-income countries. Today, Aurolab lenses are </span><a href="https://www.seva.org/site/SPageServer/?pagename=25_Years_of_Aurolab" rel="">exported to more than 140 countries</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Even with lowered costs, hospitals and clinics face challenges connecting with prospective patients. In the late 1970s, </span><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thulasiraj-Ravilla/publication/263430927_Efficient_high-volume_cataract_services_The_Aravind_model/links/552d085c0cf29b22c9c49d50/Efficient-high-volume-cataract-services-The-Aravind-model.pdf?origin=publication_detail&amp;_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InNpZ251cCIsInBhZ2UiOiJwdWJsaWNhdGlvbkRvd25sb2FkIiwicHJldmlvdXNQYWdlIjoicHVibGljYXRpb24ifX0" rel="">less than 15 percent</a><span> of people in Aravind’s service area who needed eye care were actively seeking it. The hospital network targeted the remaining 85 percent by increasing outreach.</span><span> By working with social organizations, NGOs, volunteers, and schools, Aravind began to organize screening camps. Each year, these camps serve over half a million people, with more than one-third receiving interventions they would never otherwise have gotten.</span></p><p><span>Similar outreach efforts occur across many low-income countries. Multiple organizations, including NGOs like </span><a href="https://www.sightsavers.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Sightsavers-Global-Annual-Report-2020.pdf" rel="">Sightsavers</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.lionsclubs.org/en/member-resource-center/service/global-causes-initiatives/vision" rel="">Lions Clubs</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.helpageindia.org/our-work/healthcare/restoration-of-vision-correction" rel="">HelpAge India</a><span>, play a large role in organizing eye screening camps and mobilizing communities to connect clinics with patients. In countries such as Bangladesh, Gambia, and Tanzania, outreach camps, community mobilization, and public-private partnerships work with NGOs to </span><a href="https://www.sightsavers.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/14755_Insight-Plus-Issue-2-FINAL.pdf" rel="">provide awareness campaigns</a><span> and follow-up care.</span></p><p><span>Finally, more trained personnel are needed. Aravind uses a two-pronged approach to addressing the lack of ophthalmologists: First, it enhances the efficiency of the existing staff. The hospital has an innovative “assembly line” operating theatre that allows a single surgeon to alternate between two fully prepared tables, each supported by dedicated instrument sets and nursing teams. This approach enables </span><a href="https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/aravind-eye-care-system-mcdonaldization-of-eye-care/" rel="">six to eight cataract operations</a><span> per hour compared to an industry norm of one, while delivering clinical outcomes that even surpass those achieved in the UK’s National Health Service.</span></p><p><span>Second, it expands its training efforts. At Aravind, nurses and technicians, drawn largely from local communities and often women with no prior medical background, are trained to function as certified ophthalmic assistants. Representing about </span><a href="https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-rctom/submission/aravind-eye-care-system-mcdonaldization-of-eye-care/" rel="">60 percent</a><span> of the workforce, these cross-trained staff handle multiple roles, from preliminary examinations to surgical preparation.</span></p><p><span>Regardless of what individual agencies, clinics, and hospitals do, more governments should play a larger role in making eye health more widely accessible. India’s central government runs the </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3562965/" rel="">National Program for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment (NPCBVI)</a><span>, which includes major subsidies for cataract surgeries and the aforementioned screening and surgical campaigns. Currently, programs like “</span><a href="https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1944598" rel="">Netra Jyoti Abhiyan</a><span>” aim to clear the national cataract backlog by subsidizing millions of surgeries annually. The </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1772878/" rel="">Vision 2020 initiative</a><span> significantly increased cataract surgery rates in Africa, with regions like Kenya’s Kwale and Tanzania’s Kilimanjaro nearly doubling their surgical rates through community screening and the expansion of trained staff. And in Latin America, Brazil’s federal mass campaign efforts have </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10021674/" rel="">greatly reduced cataract blindness</a><span>.</span></p><p>Ultimately, efforts such as these acknowledge the fact that a successful cataract program is a clear public good, a clinical intervention with enormous implications for the economy and global health. It is not measured only in restored sight but in restored agency: the grandmother who reads again, the laborer who returns to work, the child who need not drop out of school to guide a blind parent.</p><p><span>Technology, including biomedicine, achieves its greatest impact when delivered equitably. This does not mean everyone in the world must have access to </span><em>exactly</em><span> the same methods of care, but it should mean we strive to extend the “triumphs of science” to as many people as possible. The ability to restore vision is a measure of clinical brilliance. Making it universal is the measure of our humanity.</span></p><p><strong>Dr. Sangeetha Aravinda </strong><span>is an ophthalmologist and consultant at Aravind Eye Hospital, currently residing in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India.
