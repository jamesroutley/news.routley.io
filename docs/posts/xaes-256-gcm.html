        <section>
            <p>About a year ago <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/xaes-256-gcm-11/">I wrote</a> that “I want to use XAES-256-GCM/11, which has a number of nice properties and only the annoying defect of not existing.” Well, there is now <a href="https://c2sp.org/XAES-256-GCM?ref=words.filippo.io">an XAES-256-GCM specification</a>. (Had to give up on the /11 part, but that was just a performance optimization.)</p>
<p>XAES-256-GCM is an <em>authenticated encryption with additional data</em> (AEAD) algorithm with 256-bit keys and <strong>192-bit nonces</strong>. It was designed with the following goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>supporting a nonce large enough to be safe to generate randomly for a virtually unlimited number of messages (2⁸⁰ messages with collision risk 2⁻³²);</li>
<li>full, straightforward FIPS 140 compliance; and</li>
<li>trivial implementation on top of common cryptographic libraries.</li>
</ol>
<p>The large nonce enables safer and more friendly APIs that automatically read a fresh nonce from the operating system’s CSPRNG for every message, without burdening the user with any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack?ref=words.filippo.io">birthday bound</a> calculations. Compliance and compatibility make it available anywhere an AEAD might be needed, including in settings where alternative large-nonce AEADs are not an option.</p>
<p>Like XChaCha20Poly1305, XAES-256-GCM is an extended-nonce construction on top of AES-256-GCM. That is, it uses the key and the large nonce to compute a derived key for the underlying AEAD.</p>
<p>It’s simple enough to fit inline in this newsletter. Here we go. <em>K</em> and <em>N</em> are the input key and nonce, <em>Kₓ</em> and <em>Nₓ</em> are the derived AES-256-GCM key and nonce.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>L</em> = AES-256ₖ(0¹²⁸)</li>
<li>If MSB₁(<em>L</em>) = 0, then <em>K1</em> = <em>L</em> &lt;&lt; 1;</li>
<li><em>M1</em> = 0x00 || 0x01 || <code>X</code> || 0x00 || <em>N</em>[:12]</li>
<li><em>M2</em> = 0x00 || 0x02 || <code>X</code> || 0x00 || <em>N</em>[:12]</li>
<li><em>Kₓ</em> = AES-256ₖ(<em>M1</em> ⊕ <em>K1</em>) || AES-256ₖ(<em>M2</em> ⊕ <em>K1</em>)</li>
<li><em>Nₓ</em> = <em>N</em>[12:]</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, it costs three AES-256ₖ calls per message, although one can be precomputed for a given key, and the other two can reuse its key schedule.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/XAES-256-GCM/go/XAES-256-GCM.go?ref=words.filippo.io">Go reference implementation</a> fits in less than 100 lines of mostly boilerplate, including the precomputation optimization, and only uses the standard library’s crypto/cipher and crypto/aes.</p>
<p>Importantly, you could also describe XAES-256-GCM entirely in terms of a standard <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-108/rev-1/final?ref=words.filippo.io">NIST SP 800-108r1</a> KDF and the standard NIST AES-256-GCM AEAD (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/38/d/final?ref=words.filippo.io">NIST SP 800-38D</a>, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/197/final?ref=words.filippo.io">FIPS 197</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instantiate a counter-based KDF (<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-108r1.pdf?ref=words.filippo.io#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A79%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C70%2C300%2C0%5D">NIST SP 800-108r1, Section 4.1</a>) with CMAC-AES256 (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-38b/final?ref=words.filippo.io">NIST SP 800-38B</a>) and the input key as <em>Kin</em>, the ASCII letter <code>X</code> (0x58) as <em>Label</em>, the first 96 bits of the input nonce as <em>Context</em> (as recommended by <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-108r1.pdf?ref=words.filippo.io#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A71%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C70%2C720%2C0%5D">NIST SP 800-108r1, Section 4</a>, point 4), a counter (<em>i</em>) size of 16 bits, and omitting the optional <em>L</em> field, and produce a 256-bit derived key. Use that derived key and the last 96 bits of the input nonce with AES-256-GCM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the choice of parameters, if we peel off the KDF and CMAC abstractions, the result is barely slower and more complex than straightforwardly invoking AES-256 on a counter. In exchange, we get a vetted and compliant solution. The parameters <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/C2SP/blob/main/XAES-256-GCM/openssl/openssl.c?ref=words.filippo.io">are supported by the high-level OpenSSL API</a>, too.</p>
<p>Why no more “/11”? Well, half the point of using AES-GCM is FIPS 140 compliance. (The other half being hardware acceleration.) If we mucked with the rounds number the design wouldn’t be compliant.</p>
<p>Indeed, if compliance is not a goal there are a number of alternatives, from AES-GCM-SIV to modern AEAD constructions based on the AES core. The specification has <a href="https://c2sp.org/XAES-256-GCM?ref=words.filippo.io#alternatives">an extensive Alternatives section</a> that compares each of them to XAES-256-GCM.</p>
<p>Also included in the specification are <a href="https://c2sp.org/XAES-256-GCM?ref=words.filippo.io#test-vectors">test vectors</a> for the two main code paths (MSB₁(<em>L</em>) = 0 and 1), and <a href="https://c2sp.org/XAES-256-GCM?ref=words.filippo.io#accumulated-randomized-tests">accumulated test vectors</a> that compress 10 000 or 1 000 000 random iterations.</p>
<p>To sum up, XAES-256-GCM is designed to be a safe, boring, compliant, and interoperable AEAD that can fit high-level APIs, the kind we’d like to add to Go. It’s designed to complement XChaCha20Poly1305 and AES-GCM-SIV as implementations of a hypothetical <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/54364?ref=words.filippo.io#issuecomment-1642676993">nonce-less AEAD API</a>. If other cryptography library maintainers like it (or don’t), I would love to hear about it, because we are not big fans of adding Go-specific constructions to the standard library.</p>

<h2 id="the-picture">The picture</h2>
<p>Earlier this year I ran in the <a href="https://www.centopassi.net/?ref=words.filippo.io">Centopassi</a> motorcycle competition. It involves driving more than 1600km on mountain roads, through one hundred GPS coordinates you select in advance from a long list, in three days and a half. It’s been fantastic. It took me to corners of Italy I would have never seen, and I had a lot of fun. This picture is taken at our 100th location, after a couple kilometers of unpaved hairpins on the side of the hill. The finish line was at the lake you can see in the distance. I was ecstatic.</p>
<p>That’s my 2014 KTM Duke 690, a single-cylinder “naked” from before KTM knew how to make larger street bikes. It’s weird and I love it.</p>
