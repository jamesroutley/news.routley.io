<h3>from the <i>merge-ALL-the-things!</i> dept</h3>

<p>We just got done noting how pretty much all of the criticism of the Sprint T-Mobile merger by economists and consumer advocates <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/10/17/everything-t-mobile-sprint-merger-critics-predicted-has-come-true/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/10/17/everything-t-mobile-sprint-merger-critics-predicted-has-come-true/">wound up being true</a>. The deal has resulted in more than 10,000+ eliminated jobs, steady price hikes, annoying new fees, a weaker T-Mobile brand, and a lower quality product overall. It also clearly distracted T-Mobile from <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/23/t-mobile-hacked-eighth-time-in-five-years/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/01/23/t-mobile-hacked-eighth-time-in-five-years/">competent network security</a>.</p>
<p>T-Mobile’s reddit forums are filled with employees saying the disruptive spirit of the company has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/10zsncc/what_changed_about_tmobiles_employee_experience/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/10zsncc/what_changed_about_tmobiles_employee_experience/">dead since the merger</a>. T-Mobile customers are annoyed by <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/10/30/t-mobile-backs-off-price-hike-they-pretended-wasnt-a-price-hike/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/10/30/t-mobile-backs-off-price-hike-they-pretended-wasnt-a-price-hike/">endless new restrictions and price hikes</a>. </p>
<p>But Verizon and AT&amp;T customers are also pissed, and are part of a new <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/t-mobile-must-face-private-antitrust-lawsuit-over-26-bln-sprint-deal-us-judge-2023-11-03/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/t-mobile-must-face-private-antitrust-lawsuit-over-26-bln-sprint-deal-us-judge-2023-11-03/">lawsuit against T-Mobile</a> arguing that the merger raised prices for <strong>everybody</strong> due to the reduction in overall wireless market competition. A federal judge in Chicago last week ruled that plaintiffs made some decent points and the lawsuit should be allowed to proceed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin in a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/mopajzamwva/Dale%20v%20T%20Mobile%20order%2020231102.pdf" target="_blank">41-page ruling</a> on Thursday said the plaintiffs “plausibly” argued that higher prices “flowed directly” from the $26 billion merger.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The important time to protect consumers is before these kinds of competition-eroding deals are approved, but that very clearly didn’t happen here. Trump regulators at the FCC <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/10/22/fcc-approved-t-mobile-sprint-merger-without-even-seeing-full-details/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/10/22/fcc-approved-t-mobile-sprint-merger-without-even-seeing-full-details/">didn’t even bother to read about the deal’s impact</a> before approving it. Trump “antitrust enforcers” at the FTC actively helped T-Mobile <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/12/30/doj-antitrust-boss-delrahim-ignored-hard-data-as-he-rubber-stamped-t-mobile-merger/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/12/30/doj-antitrust-boss-delrahim-ignored-hard-data-as-he-rubber-stamped-t-mobile-merger/">avoid regulatory scrutiny on their personal time</a>, you know, like antitrust enforcers do. </p>
<p>T-Mobile’s response to the lawsuit was expected: to deny everything and insist the U.S. wireless sector is secretly super competitive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Attorneys for T-Mobile <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/legaldocs/jnpwwzdgrpw/Softbank%20Tmobile%20-%2079.pdf" target="_blank">called</a> the lawsuit “unprecedented,” and said the plaintiffs’ damages were “speculative.”</em></p>
<p><em>“If plaintiffs are unhappy with Verizon and AT&amp;T, there is a remedy available in the highly competitive market that wireless consumers enjoy today — they should switch to T-Mobile, not sue it,” attorneys for T-Mobile told the court.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The harms of mindless consolidation are not theoretical. They’re clearly documented. Yet we’re dedicated to ignoring those harms because such consolidation is hugely profitable for a handful of over-compensated executives and a few key investors (sometimes). Rinse, wash, repeat, with nobody responsible for the end result getting within a thousand miles of introspection or accountability. </p>
<p>I’d not expect much from the suit in terms of reform. Any payout will be a tiny fraction of the financial harm caused. The real fix lies in more stringent merger review and well funded and staffed regulators; concepts defenders of a broken but profitable status quo have no real interest in. </p>
