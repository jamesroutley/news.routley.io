Widgets also become interactive so users can complete a reminder, play or pause media, access home controls, and perform various tasks directly from the widget on their desktop. And through the magic of Continuity, users can further customize their Mac with widgets from their iPhone.

                 <div>In Safari, profiles keep browsing separate between topics like work, school, and more so users can quickly switch between them. Private Browsing gets even better with added protection against some of the most advanced techniques used to track users — Private Browsing windows become locked when not in use and known trackers are blocked from loading. Safari users can also now add any website to the Dock as they would with an app, complete with a simplified toolbar and notifications for an app-like experience.
