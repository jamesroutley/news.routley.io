<p>After rumors swirled that TikTok owner ByteDance had lost tens of millions after an intern sabotaged its AI models, ByteDance issued a statement this weekend hoping to silence all the social media chatter in China.</p>
<p>In a social media <a href="https://www.toutiao.com/w/1813324433807370/?target_app=4916">post</a> translated and reviewed by Ars, ByteDance clarified &#34;facts&#34; about &#34;interns destroying large model training&#34; and confirmed that one intern was fired in August.</p>
<p>According to ByteDance, the intern had held a position in the company&#39;s commercial technology team but was fired for committing &#34;serious disciplinary violations.&#34; Most notably, the intern allegedly &#34;maliciously interfered with the model training tasks&#34; for a ByteDance research project, ByteDance said.</p>
<p>None of the intern&#39;s sabotage impacted ByteDance&#39;s commercial projects or online businesses, ByteDance said, and none of ByteDance&#39;s large models were affected.</p>
<p>Online rumors suggested that more than 8,000 graphical processing units were involved in the sabotage and that ByteDance lost &#34;tens of millions of dollars&#34; due to the intern&#39;s interference, but these claims were &#34;seriously exaggerated,&#34; ByteDance said.</p>
<p>The tech company also accused the intern of adding misleading information to his social media profile, seemingly posturing that his work was connected to ByteDance&#39;s AI Lab rather than its commercial technology team. In the statement, ByteDance confirmed that the intern&#39;s university was notified of what happened, as were industry associations, presumably to prevent the intern from misleading others.</p>
<p>ByteDance&#39;s statement this weekend didn&#39;t seem to silence all the rumors online, though.</p>
<p>One commenter on ByteDance&#39;s social media post disputed the distinction between the AI Lab and the commercial technology team, claiming that &#34;the commercialization team he is in was previously under the AI Lab. In the past two years, the team&#39;s recruitment was written as AI Lab. He joined the team as an intern in 2021, and it might be the most advanced AI Lab.&#34;</p>
