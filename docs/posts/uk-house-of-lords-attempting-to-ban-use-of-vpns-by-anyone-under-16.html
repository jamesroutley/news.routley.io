    <h1>UK House of Lords attempting to ban use of VPNs by anyone under 16</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is deranged, <a href="https://bills.parliament.uk/publications/63901/documents/7465">each nation’s boomers and reactionaries attempting to outdo the others</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Action to prohibit the provision of VPN services to children in the United Kingdom</strong>” … the provider of any Relevant VPN Service which is, or is likely to be — (i) offered or marketed to persons in the United Kingdom; (ii) provided to a significant number of persons. (c) must make provision for the monitoring and effective enforcement of the child VPN prohibition.</p>
</blockquote>



<hr/>



<p>VPNs are <a href="https://alecmuffett.com/article/113969">a technology which anyone can implement for themselves</a>. “Regulatory compliance” of them is not feasible, it’d be like banning DIY.</p>



<p>Not to mention it would include The Tor Project.</p>
