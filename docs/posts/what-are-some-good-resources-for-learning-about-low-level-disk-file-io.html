    <h1>Ask HN: What are some good resources for learning about low level disk/file IO?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve been messing around with writing a toy database for fun/learning, and realised I&#39;ve got a fairly big gap in my knowledge when it comes to dealing with performance and durability when dealing with file reads/writes.</p><p>Example of some questions I&#39;d like to be able to answer or at least make reasonable decisions about (<i>note</i>: I don&#39;t actually want any answers to the above now, they&#39;re just examples of the sort of thing I&#39;d like to read in depth about, and build up
some background knowledge):</p><pre><code>  * how to ensure data&#39;s been safely written (e.g. when to flush, fsync, what
    guarantees that gives, using WAL)
  * blocks sizes to read/write for different purposes, tradeoffs, etc.
  * considerations for writing to different media/filesystems (e.g. disk, ssd, NFS)
  * when to rely on OS disk cache vs. using own cache
  * when to use/not use mmap
  * performance considerations (e.g. multiple small files vs. few larger ones,
    concurrent readers/writers, locking, etc.)
  * OS specific considerations
</code></pre><p>
I recall reading some posts (related to Redis/SQLite/Postgres) related to this, which made me realise that it&#39;s a fairly complex topic, but not one I&#39;ve found a good entry point for.</p><p>Any pointers to books, documentation, etc. on the above would be much
appreciated.</p></div></div></div>
