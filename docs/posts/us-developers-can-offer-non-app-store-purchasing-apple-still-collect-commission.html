    <h1>US developers can offer non-app store purchasing, Apple still collect commission</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div role="main" id="maincontent"><article expanded="true"><div><div data-io-article-url="/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/"><p>Apple is making major changes to its U.S. iOS <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/">App Store</a> policies, and developers are now able to direct customers to a non-App Store purchasing option for digital goods. Apple is allowing apps to feature a single link to a developer website that leads to an in-app purchase alternative, but Apple plans to continue to collect a 12 to 27 percent commission on content bought this way.</p>

<p>Developers who want to offer this option will need to apply for a StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement, as Apple has outlined in both updated ‌App Store‌ Review Guidelines and the statement of compliance submitted to the Northern California U.S. District Court. With a Link Entitlement, a developer is able to direct a user to an out-of-app purchasing mechanism using an external purchase link. From Apple&#39;s modified ‌App Store‌ rules:<br/>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Developers may apply for an entitlement to provide a link in their app to a website the developer owns or maintains responsibility for in order to purchase such items. Learn more about the entitlement. In accordance with the entitlement agreement, the link may inform users about where and how to purchase those in-app purchase items, and the fact that such items may be available for a comparatively lower price. The entitlement is limited to use only in the iOS or iPadOS App Store on the United States storefront. In all other storefronts, apps and their metadata may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.</p>
<p>If your app engages in misleading marketing practices, scams, or fraud in relation to the entitlement, your app will be removed from the App Store and you may be removed from the Apple Developer Program.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are several requirements that developers need to adhere to maintain the privacy and security of the ‌App Store‌ ecosystem, and notably, Apple will collect a commission on purchases made using these Entitlement Links. Rather than 30 percent, Apple will collect a 27 percent fee on user purchases or year-one subscriptions made through the link. On the second year of a subscription, the commission fee drops to 12 percent, which is three percentage points lower than the 15 percent fee that Apple collects from second-year or longer subscriptions made through the in-app purchase system. Apps that participate in the ‌App Store‌ Small Business Program will be charged a 12 percent commission rate.</p>
<p>The commission will apply to transactions for digital goods and services that take place on a developers website within seven days after a user taps through an External Purchase Link to an external website. </p>
<p>Several key points about Entitlement Links are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>All links to outside purchasing methods must use the Entitlement Link system, and developers must apply and get Apple&#39;s approval.</li>
<li>Developers are permitted to have a single plain link on <strong>one</strong> screen of an app. The link can be at a sign-in screen, in user settings, or elsewhere, but it can only be in one place. The single location may not be an interstitial, modal, or pop-up.</li>
<li>The link can mention the specific price of content on a website, or that content is discounted on the website from the ‌App Store‌ price. Comparisons are allowed.</li>
<li>Links cannot be placed directly on an in-app purchase screen or in the in-app purchase flow.</li>
<li>Developers need to certify that the third-party payment service provider they are using for out-of-app purchasing meets industry standards for payment processors, and that they will offer users processes for managing subscriptions, requesting refunds, and disputing unauthorized transactions.</li>
<li>Apps that participate in Apple&#39;s Video Partner Program or News Partner Program are not eligible for Link Entitlement.</li>
<li>Apps that use the StoreKit External Purchase Link must continue to offer in-app purchases as an option.</li>
<li>‌App Store‌ pages are not able to include information about purchasing on a website or a link to a website.</li>
<li>Digital purchases that are sold on an app&#39;s website through the Entitlement Link must be available for use in that app.</li>
<li>The StoreKit External Purchase Link cannot discourage users from making in-app purchases or mimic an in-app purchase.</li>
<li>Links must open a new window in the default browser of the device, and are not able to open a web view.</li>
<li>No redirecting, intermediate links, or URL tracking parameters are allowed.</li>
<li>Developers are required to provide a periodic accounting of qualifying out-of-app purchases, and Apple has a right to audit developers&#39; accounting to ensure compliance with their commission obligations and to charge interest and offset payments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Link Entitlement process and the ‌App Store‌ changes are applicable only in the U.S. ‌App Store‌. Apps for all other storefronts are not able to include buttons, external links, or calls to action that direct customers to alternative purchasing options.</p>
