    <p>Yesterday we did Rejection Therapy!</p>

<p>For us, what rejection therapy means is that you go downtown, wander around by
yourself, and ask random strangers to do you favors.</p>

<p>Examples would be asking for their newspaper, or asking for a few dollars, or a
phone number, or to try on their shoes. Or going into a store and asking for
some free food.</p>

<p>Now, I’m not a very courageous person, especially when it comes to asking
strangers for things. So when I heard we were doing rejection therapy, I was 
so nervous that I was shaking. But I knew that getting rid of this anxiety is
exactly the point of rejection therapy. We walked for about 15 minutes before
we made it downtown. I noticed that my anxiety made me very alert and I noticed
a lot more things about a lot more people – for example, whether they were
carrying something that I could ask for, or wearing something I could try on.
Of course, the exercise hadn’t officially started yet, which is how I
rationalized not approaching these opportunities I saw. During this walk I also
brainstormed questions you could ask people.</p>

<p>Once we got downtown and the exercise officially began, I achieved slightly
above my own expectations, which were fairly low. I approached maybe 12-15
people total, in an hour and a half. (Some of the others reported approaching
two or three times that number.)</p>

<p>I asked for a number of newspapers. I asked to take the plastic flowers from a
storefront. I asked to borrow board games from the board game store. I asked to
climb a ladder that a construction worker was setting up – and he let me!</p>

<p>I asked a couple eating lunch on the grass if they would meditate with me for 5
minutes. They didn’t want to, but they said “after lunch maybe.” I went back 20
minutes later and I was too shy to actually ask again, partly because they were
cuddling and being rather private and I didn’t want to disturb them. But that’s
mostly just a rationalization.</p>

<p>I asked a girl if I could try on her sunglasses and she said “what is this,
some kind of psychology class experiment?” Apparently someone else in her group
had recently been approached. I was a bit too flustered to ask her for anything else.</p>

<p>I noticed two good effects from the experiment. The first was that I was a LOT
less shy once I got into the swing of things. I was still shy about talking to
people for any length of time, but approach anxiety was greatly reduced. I was
able to ask for something which I legitimately wanted: I smelled malt outside a
brewpub, walked in, saw they were brewing, and asked the head brewer for a
tour. (He didn’t give me one for insurance reasons, but I got an invitation to
come on a Saturday and he would show me around.) This is something I would
never or rarely do before, and during Rejection Therapy, I felt a lot more
comfortable doing it. I expect this level of comfort to decline somewhat, but
just knowing that I can do it is a big step forward in terms of comfort.</p>

<p>Later that day, Anna Salamon gave a talk where she talked about one of the
goals of rationality as “building affordances” in everyday life. This is an
analogy to physical affordances, like a cup affords drinking and a knob affords
turning and a button affords pressing. However, Anna is talking about mental
affordances – having flags go up in your brain when you notice that a
situation matches a pattern, and knowing how to react in such a pattern. So the
other effect from the rejection therapy experiment was that I noticed myself
building the affordance that “strangers afford talking” – that now I was
noticing situations where I could ask strangers for things, and reasons to talk
to them. I expect this effect will decline only a little bit.</p>
