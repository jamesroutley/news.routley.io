The rocket lost thrust after the first stage separation due to an “abnormal startup of the engine” on the vehicle’s second stage that may have been caused by an instability in the engine and fuel system, according to KCNA. </p><p>Following its malfunction, the rocket tumbled down and crashed into the sea off the west coast of the Korean Peninsula. Its crash triggered a false state of emergency in parts of South Korea and Japan, sounding off air raid alarms and evacuation warnings.<br/></p><p>North Korea is trying to salvage rocket parts from the sea and investigate the exact cause of the anomaly in an effort to resolve any issues before attempting a second launch of the satellite, KCNA reported.</p><p>Even before the rocket crashed into the sea, its launch was deemed controversial due to an international ban on North Korea from using ballistic missile technology.
