            <p>
                PC-BASIC aims for bug-for-bug compatibility with Microsoft GW-BASIC.
                It runs ASCII, tokenised and protected BASIC programs and supports the Microsoft Binary Format for full interchangeability of data files.
            </p>

            <h3>Printing</h3>
            <p>
                No helper programs or difficult settings needed: printing through LPRINT and LPT1: works out of the box.

            <h3>Languages</h3>
            <p>
                PC-BASIC understands a large number of MS-DOS code pages and supports all Unicode scripts natively. BASIC program in Chinese? Not a problem for PC-BASIC.
