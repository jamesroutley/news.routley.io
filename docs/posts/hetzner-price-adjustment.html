This phenomenon has been affecting people and industries across the globe. And since prices are not likely to drop or stabilize in the near future, we are forced to increase the prices of many of our products by approximately 10%. In addition, we also unfortunately need to implement a serious increase to the electricity/air conditioning rates for our colocation products.</p>

<p>A large number of our products in all locations are affected. The electricity/air conditioning flat rates for our colocation products are also affected.</p>
<p>The products that do not directly use electricity are not affected: IPs, domains, SSL certificates, racks, setup fees, and a few other examples.</p>

<p>All affected products that customers order starting on 1 September 2022 will have the new prices.</p>
<p>For existing products (ones customers have ordered and we have brought online before 1 September 2022), the prices will stay the same until 31 December 2022. The prices for existing products will change starting on 1 January 2023. This way, our existing customers will benefit from having the lower prices for an additional four months.</p>

<p>We believe that our products still provide you with a fair price-to-performance offer. However, if you choose to end your contract, you can cancel and/or delete products using our customer administration interfaces and within the normal cancellation period. This will allow you to stop using the affected products before the new prices come into effect. We will unfortunately not be able to continue to offer our services under the old conditions. In a later email we will include information about cancelling products due to special circumstances.</p></article></div></div></div></div></section></main></div></div>
