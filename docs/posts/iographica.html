                IOGraph users have sent a lot of interesting features ideas,
                so that’s why have vector export, export of the data in
                numbers, IOGraphs social sharing, setting the application icon
                to system tray, autosaving images to sequence, showing the
                application status in the icon and creating a number of
                filters to enhance the output image — all of that is our
                future features list. If you have any interesting idea or a
                feature you’d like to be implemented in IOGraph (which is not
                in the list already) feel free to send us an e-mail
                with it.
