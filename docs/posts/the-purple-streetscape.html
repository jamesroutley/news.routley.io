    <h1>The Purple Streetscape</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>Across the United States, streets are taking on a strange hue at night. Purple.</p>
<p>Purple streetlights have been reported in Tampa, Vancouver, Wichita, Boston.
They&#39;re certainly in evidence here in Albuquerque, where Coal through downtown
has turned almost entirely to mood lighting. Explanations vary. When I first
saw the phenomenon, I thought of fixtures that combined RGB elements and
thought perhaps one of the color channels had failed.</p>
<p>Others on the internet offer more involved explanations. &#34;A black light
surveillance network,&#34; one conspiracist calls them, as he shows his
mushroom-themed blacklight poster fluorescing on the side of a highway. I
remain unclear on what exactly a shadowy cabal would gain from installing
blacklights across North America, but I am nonetheless charmed by his
fluorescent fingerpainting demonstration. The topic of &#34;blacklight&#34; is a
somewhat complex one with LEDs.</p>
<p>Historically, &#34;blacklight&#34; had referred to long-wave UV lamps, also called
UV-A. These lamps emitted light around 400nm, beyond violet light, thus the
term ultraviolet. This light is close to, but not quite in, the visible
spectrum, which is ideal for observing the effect of fluorescence. Fluorescence
is a fascinating but also mundane physical phenomenon in which many materials
will absorb light, becoming excited, and then re-emit it as they relax. The
process is not completely efficient, so the re-emited light is longer in
wavelength than the absorbed light.</p>
<p>Because of this  loss of energy, a fluorescent material excited by a blacklight
will emit light down in the visible spectrum. The effect seems a bit like
magic: the fluorescence is far brighter, to the human eye, than the ultraviolet
light that incited it. The trouble is that the common use of UV light to show
fluorescence leads to a bit of a misconception that ultraviolet light is
required. Not at all, fluorescent materials will emit just about any light at a
slightly lower wavelength. The emitted light is relatively weak, though, and
under broad spectrum lighting is unlikely to stand out against the ambient
lighting. Fluorescence always occurs, it&#39;s just much more visible under a light
source that humans can&#39;t see.</p>
<p>When we consider LEDs, though, there is an economic aspect to consider. The
construction of LEDs that emit UV light turns out to be quite difficult. There
are now options on the market, but only relatively recently, and they run a
considerable price premium compared to visible wavelength LEDs. The vast
majority of &#34;LED blacklights&#34; are not actually blacklights; they don&#39;t actually
emit UV. They&#39;re just blue. Human eyes aren&#39;t so sensitive to blue, especially
the narrow emission of blue LEDs, and so these blue &#34;blacklights&#34; work well
enough for showing fluorescence, although not as well as a &#34;real&#34; blacklight
(still typically gas discharge).</p>
<p>This was mostly a minor detail of theatrical lighting until COVID, when some
combination of unknowing buyers and unscrupulous sellers lead to a wave of
people using blue LEDs in an attempt to sanitize things. That doesn&#39;t work,
long-wave UV already barely has enough energy to have much of a sanitizing
effect and blue LEDs have none at all. For sanitizing purposes you need short
wave UV, or UV-C, which has so much energy that it is almost ionizing
radiation. The trouble, of course, is that this energy damages most biological
things, including us. UV-C lights can quickly cause mild (but very unpleasant)
eye damage called flashburn or &#34;welder&#39;s eye,&#34; and more serious exposure can
cause permanent damage to your eyes and skin. Funny, then, that all the people
waving blue LEDs over their groceries on Instagram reels were at least saving
themselves from an unpleasant learning experience.</p>
<p>You can probably see how this all ties back to streetlights. The purple
streetlights are not &#34;blacklights,&#34; but the clear fluorescence of our friend&#39;s
psychedelic art tells us that they are emitting energy mostly at the short
end of the visible spectrum, allowing the longer wave light emitted by the
poster to appear inexplicably bright to our eyes. We are apparently looking at
some sort of blue LED.</p>
<p>Those familiar with modern LED lighting probably easily see what&#39;s happening.
LEDs are largely monochromatic lighting sources, they emit a single wavelength
that results in very poor color rendering, which is both aesthetically
unpleasing and produces poor perception for drivers. While some fixtures do
indeed combine LEDs of multiple colors to produce white output, there&#39;s another
technique that is less expensive, more energy efficient, and produces better
quality light. Today&#39;s inexpensive, good quality LED lights have been enabled
by phosphor coatings.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the idea: LEDs of a single color illuminate a phosphorous material.
Phosphorescence is actually a closely related phenomenon to fluorescence, but
involves kicking an electron up to a different spin state. Fewer materials
exhibit this effect than fluorescence, but chemists have devised synthetic
phosphors that can sort of &#34;rearrange&#34; light energy within the spectrum.</p>
<p>Blue LEDs are the most energy efficient, so a typical white LED light uses
blue LEDs coated in a phosphor that absorbs a portion of the blue light and
re-emits it at longer wavelengths. The resulting spectrum, the combination of
some of the blue light passing through and red and green light emitted by the
phosphor, is a high-CRI white light ideal for street lighting.</p>
<p>Incidentally, one of the properties of phosphorescence that differentiates it
from fluorescence is that phosphors take a while to &#34;relax&#34; back to their lower
energy state. A phosphor will continue to glow after the energy that excited it
is gone. This effect has long been employed for &#34;glow in the dark&#34; materials
that continue to glow softly for an extended period of time after the room goes
dark. During the Cold War, the Civil Defense Administration recommended
outlining stair treads and doors with such phosphorescent tape so that you
could more safely navigate your home during a blackout. The same idea is still
employed aboard aircraft and ships, and I suppose you could still do it to your
house, it would be fun.</p>
<p>Phosphor-conversion white LEDs use phosphors that minimize this effect but they
still exhibit it. Turn off a white LED light in a dark room and you will probably
notice that it continues to glow dimly for a short time. You are observing the
phosphor slowly relaxing.</p>
<p>So what of the purple streetlights? The phosphor has failed, at least
partially, and the lights are emitting the natural spectrum of their LEDs
rather than the &#34;adjusted&#34; spectrum produced by the phosphor. The exact reason
for this failure doesn&#39;t seem to have been publicized, but judging by the
apparently rapid onset most people think the phosphor is delaminating and
falling off of the LEDs rather than slowly burning away or undergoing some sort
of corrosion. They may have simply not used a very good glue.</p>
<p>So we have a technical explanation: white LED streetlights are not white LEDs
but blue LEDs with phosphor conversion. If the phosphor somehow fails or comes
off, their spectrum shifts towards deep blue. Some combination of remaining
phosphor on the lights and environmental conditions (we are not used to seeing
large areas under monochromatic blue light) causes this to come off as an eery
purple.</p>
<p>There is also, though, a system question. How is it that so many streetlights
across so many cities are demonstrating the same failure at around the same
time?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is monopolization.</p>
<p>Virtually all LED street lighting installed in North America is manufactured by
Acuity Brands. Based in Atlanta, Acuity is a hundred-year-old industrial
conglomerate that originally focused on linens and janitorial supplies. In 1969,
though, Acuity acquired Lithonia: one of the United States&#39; largest manufacturers
of area lighting. Acuity gained a lighting division, and it was on the war path.
Through a huge number of acquisitions, everything from age-old area lighting
giants like Holophane to VC-funded networked lighting companies have become part
of Acuity.</p>
<p>In the mean time, GE&#39;s area lighting division petered out along with the rest
of GE (they recently sold their entire lighting division to a consumer home
automation company). Directories of street lighting manufacturers now list
Acuity followed by a list of brands Acuity owns. Their dominant competitor for
traditional street lighting are probably Cree and Cooper (part of Eaton), but
both are well behind Acuity in municipal sales.</p>
<p>Starting around 2017, Acuity started to manufacture defective lights. The exact
nature of the defect is unclear, but it seems to cause abrupt failure of the
phosphor after around five years. And here we are, over five years later, with
purple streets.</p>
<p>The situation is not quite as bad as it sounds. Acuity offered a long warranty
on their street lighting, and the affected lights are still covered. Acuity is
sending contractors to replace defective lights at their expensive, but they
have to coordinate with street lighting operators to identify defective lights
and schedule the work. It&#39;s a long process. Many cities have over a thousand
lights to replace, but finding them is a problem on its own.</p>
<p>Most cities have invested in some sort of smart streetlighting solution. The
most common approach is a module that plugs into the standard photocell
receptacle on the light and both controls the light and reports energy use over
a municipal LTE network. These modules can automatically identify many failure
modes based on changes on power consumption. The problem is that the phosphor
failure is completely nonelectrical, so the faulty lights can&#39;t be located by
energy monitoring.</p>
<p>So, while I can&#39;t truly rule out the possibility of a blacklight surveillance
network, I&#39;d suggest you report purple lights to your city or electrical
utility. They&#39;re likely already working with Acuity on a replacement campaign,
but they may not know the exact scale of the problem yet.</p>
<hr/>
<p>While I&#39;m at it, let&#39;s talk about another common failure mode of outdoor LED
lighting: flashing. LED lights use a constant current power supply (often
called a driver in this context) that regulates the voltage applied to the LEDs
to achieve their rated current. Unfortunately, several failure modes can cause
the driver to continuously cycle. Consider the common case of an LED module
that has failed in such a way that it shorts at high temperature. The driver
will turn on until the faulty module gets warm enough and the driver turns off
again on current protection. The process repeats indefinitely. Some drivers
have a &#34;soft start&#34; feature and some failure modes cause current to rise beyond
limits over time, so it&#39;s not unusual for these faulty lights to fade in before
shutting off.</p>
<p>It&#39;s actually a very similar situation to the cycling that gas discharge street
lighting used to show, but as is the way of electronics, it happens faster.
Aged sodium bulbs would often cause the ballast to hit its current limit over
the span of perhaps five minutes, cycling the light on and off. Now it often
happens twice in a second.</p>
<p>I once saw a parking lot where nearly every light had failed this way. I would
guess that lightning had struck, creating a transient that damaged all of them
at once. It felt like a silent rave, only a little color could have made it
better. Unfortunately they were RAB, not Acuity, and the phosphor was holding
on.</p>
