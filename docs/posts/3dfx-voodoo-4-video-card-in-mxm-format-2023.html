    <h1>3dfx Voodoo 4 video card in MXM format (2023)</h1>

<p>I managed to fix the scaler brightness/contrast bug, and set them to some decent values (I&#39;ll tweak it to &#34;perfection&#34; later). Now the display looks so much better:</p>

<p>Also measured VRMs temperature, as these are not covered at all by the existing heatsink.</p>

<p>At 2.5V VCORE, 166MHz core/memory frequency, idle: 85.9C, load: 87.6C. This is well within spec, the VRM ICs are rated to operate at 125C. If it ever gets beyond that, the MCU will immediately shut down the power rails and issue an overtemperature event that will shutdown the laptop. This way nothing will ever get damaged.</p>  

<p>There is a temperature sensor right underneath the VSA, but it&#39;s not currently read by the MCU:</p>

<p>When doing the VRM temperature measurements, I found a bug.</p>

<p>When I tested the card plugged into a PC, I was able to overclock it just fine with V.ctrl or VSA100 OC.</p>


<p>Found some other issues as well. While the VSA-FPGA-HDMI works fine for 640x480,800x600,960x720,1024x768,1152x864,1280x720,1280x1024,1360x768,1600x900,1600x1024, and the HDMI-SCALER-LVDS works fine for  those resolutions as well, when doing VSA-FPGA-SCALER-PANEL there are quite a few resolutions with major issues. I suspect most of this is caused by my FPGA code, as well as the whole image shifted to the right by about 5 pixels.</p></div><p><small>Last edited by <span><span role="text presentation">sdz</span></span> on 2024-06-06, 13:36.
