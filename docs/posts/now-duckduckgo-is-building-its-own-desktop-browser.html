    <h1>Now DuckDuckGo is building its own desktop browser</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="lazyloadImages">
        
                
                                                    
            <p>Privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo has offered a first look at its forthcoming desktop &#34;browsing app&#34; that promises simple default privacy settings. </p>
    

                        
    <p>DuckDuckGo CEO Gabriel Weinberg details its desktop browser in a <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-2021-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">blogpost recapping its milestones for 2021</a>, including 150 million downloads of its all-in-one privacy apps for iOS and Android and Chromium extensions. </p><p>Weinberg attempts to distinguish the DuckDuckGo desktop browser from the likes of Chromium-based Brave and Mozilla Firefox by arguing it is not a &#34;privacy browser&#34;. Instead, it&#39;s just a browser that offers &#34;robust privacy protection&#34; by default and works across search, browsing, email and more. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s an everyday browsing app that respects your privacy because there&#39;s never a bad time to stop companies from spying on your search and browsing history,&#34; writes Weinberg. </p><p>Weinberg offers a few clues about the internals underpinning the DuckDuckGo desktop browser or &#34;app&#34; as it calls it, but also leaves out a lot of details. </p><p>He says it won&#39;t be based on Chromium, the open source project underpinning Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Vivaldi and about 30 other browsers. </p><p>&#34;Instead of forking Chromium or anything else, we&#39;re building our desktop app around the OS-provided rendering engines (like on mobile), allowing us to strip away a lot of the unnecessary cruft and clutter that&#39;s accumulated over the years in major browsers,&#34; explains Weinberg. </p>
    
<p>It&#39;s not clear what desktop OS-provided rendering engines he&#39;s referring to but it&#39;s not a trivial task to build a desktop browser without Chromium&#39;s Blink rendering engine. Just ask Microsoft, which <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mozilla-why-microsoft-edges-switch-to-googles-chromium-is-bad-news/" target="_blank">launched its Chromium-based Edge browser</a> <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-microsoft-begins-automatically-pushing-chromium-edge-to-users/" target="_blank">last year</a>. Apple meanwhile uses WebKit for Safari on desktop and requires all non-Safari browsers on iOS, including Chrome, to use WebKit for iOS. </p><p>ZDNet has asked DuckDuckGo for a clarification, but DuckDuckGo&#39;s communications manager Allison Johnson has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848133/duckduckgo-browser-pc-mac-beta-privacy-default-settings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">provided some details to The Verge</a> about the rendering engines.</p><p>&#34;macOS and Windows both now offer website rendering APIs (WebView/WebView2) that any application can use to render a website. That&#39;s what we&#39;ve used to build our app on desktop,&#34; said Johnson.</p><p>Microsoft&#39;s implementation of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-edge-gets-better-support-for-web-apps-and-pdfs/">WebView2 in Windows allows developers to embed web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript in native Windows apps</a>. WebView2 on Windows uses Microsoft Edge as the rendering engine to display websites in those apps. </p><p>&#34;We&#39;re building the desktop app from the ground up around the OS-provided rendering APIs. This means that anything beyond website rendering (e.g., tabs &amp; bookmark management, navigation controls, passwords etc.) we have to build ourselves,&#34; said Johnson. </p><p>So, on Windows, the DuckDuckGo browser rendering will rely on <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2020/10/19/edge-webview2-general-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Edge/Chromium</a> for Windows, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/webview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-component="externalLink">Safari/Webkit</a> on macOS, The Verge notes. </p><p>Johnson highlighted that isn&#39;t forking Chromium. A clear example of forking a project is <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/blink-google-forks-webkit/" target="_blank">Google&#39;s creation of Blink</a>, where it used the open-source code behind the WebKit rendering engine (that Google and Apple had previously maintained) and then built its own web rendering engine for Chromium.  </p><p>However DuckDuckGo releases its new desktop browser, Weinberg assures that &#34;compared to Chrome, the DuckDuckGo app for desktop is cleaner, way more private, and early tests have found it significantly faster too!&#34;</p>
