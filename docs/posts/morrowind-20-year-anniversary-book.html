				<p>It may be hard to believe, but as of 2022, Bethesda Softworks’ The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is 20 years old.</p>
				<p>For so many who have played the game, the music, and the memories of playing have inspired deep nostalgia. For others, the ability to mod the game captured imaginations and inspired creativity.</p>
				<p>So, on this 20-year anniversary of one of the best RPGs ever created, we created a book capturing vignettes of the fans’ memories of the game, what it means to them, what makes it special, all these years later.</p>
				<p>Is it our hope that by reading this, you find yourself in those stories, re-discovering memories and emotions you had forgotten.</p>
				<p>I’ve also talked to people, each of them with a unique journey from their first time playing Morrowind to what they do today. Morrowind is a journey we all took on our own, today we are finally meeting at the crossroad.</p>
				<p>So, get a beverage of your choice, sit back, and bask in the nostalgia and special meaning that playing this unique gem of a game has meant to so many people.</p>
				<p>Danae, XeroFoxx, and friends.</p>
