<p><strong>Note:</strong> this post contains spoilers for one of the days of Advent of
Code 2021.</p>
<p>This article was discussed on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29757176">Hacker
News</a>.</p>
<p>This year, I had <a href="https://github.com/siraben/haoc-2021/">a lot of fun</a>
with <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/">Advent of Code</a>. There’s a nice
problem solving aspect of it and refining your initial solution is
always a fun exercise.</p>
<p>I do my solutions in Haskell, and AoC problems can be nice
explorations into various performance-wise aspects of GHC’s runtime.
My
<a href="https://github.com/siraben/haoc-2021/#haskell-advent-of-code-2021">README</a>
has some notes on what my general approach is to getting programs to
run faster.</p>
<p>But sometimes, you can get solutions that run orders of magnitude
faster, and this year I encountered such a case where my solution ran
over 2700 times faster! Let’s dive in.</p>
<h2 id="a-naïve-attempt">A naïve attempt</h2>
<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15">Day 15</a> asks us to compute the
lowest sum possible that results from traversing a grid from one
corner to the other, where the possible moves are going right, down or
up by one. When I saw this problem, I thought, “this is just
recursion!” Naturally, I wrote such a recursive solution (glguy notes
on IRC that this would be a lot faster if I memoized the calls). The
base case is if we’re at the origin point, the cost is 0. Otherwise,
the minimum cost starting at <code>(r,c)</code> is the cost of the cell at
<code>(r,c)</code> added with the minimum of recursively solving the same problem
for <code>(r-1,c)</code>, <code>(r,c-1)</code> and <code>(r,c+1)</code>.</p>

<p>This was sufficient for the very small example they gave. But it
fails even on part 1, which was a 100 by 100 grid! Clearly, even a
naïve solution won’t save us here. The next approach I went with uses
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra’s
Algorithm</a>. One
limitation I impose on myself in solving Advent of Code is to not use
any libraries outside the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/libraries/index.html">GHC bootstrap
libraries</a>.
This is simply because in some environments such as Google Code Jam or
Codeforces, fancy libraries would not exist, but ones such as
<code>containers</code> certainly would be.</p>
<p>And sure enough, Dijkstra’s algorithm was able to solve part 1 in a
few seconds. Part 2 however, just kept churning. I left my computer
running then returned to see the result, which was accepted by the
validator online. My shell also prints out how long the previous
command took to execute, so that acted as a timer.</p>

<h2 id="finding-cost-centers">Finding cost centers</h2>
<p>Even though we got the right answer, there’s no way that this is a
reasonable runtime for a solution. To find the culprit, I ran the
Haskell profiler on the program solving part 1.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>COST CENTRE                  MODULE    SRC                        %time %alloc

dijkstra.step3.nextVert.v.\  Main      day15.hs:101:47-96          86.1    0.0
dijkstra.step3.nextVert.v    Main      day15.hs:101:13-128         11.8   28.2
...
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The function to compute the next vertex to visit (see the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Pseudocode">pseudocode</a>)
by choosing vertex by minimum distance from source.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>v</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Int</span><span>,</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span>
<span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>minimumBy</span> <span>(</span><span>\</span><span>x</span> <span>y</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>compare</span> <span>(</span><span>dv</span> <span>M</span><span>.!</span> <span>x</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>dv</span> <span>M</span><span>.!</span> <span>y</span><span>))</span> <span>q</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>where <code>q</code> is the set of vertices left to visit and <code>dv</code> is a map from
vertices to distances. Using <code>minimumBy</code> on a <code>Set</code> in Haskell calls
<code>foldl&#39;</code> on sets, which is
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.6.5.1/docs/src/Data.Set.Internal.html#foldl%27">here</a>.
This procedure of course will be linear in the size of the set, and a
500 by 500 grid has 250,000 vertices to find the minimum of each time
we want to select another vertex. Yikes. I imagined, “what if we were
able to just find the next vertex of minimum distance from the source
in constant time?” Thus, we would be able to breeze through this part
of the algorithm and bring the runtime significantly down.</p>
<h2 id="priority-queues-from-scratch">Priority queues from scratch</h2>
<p>There’s a nice “duality” to the operation of Dijkstra’s algorithm when
you use a priority queue. You have a map where the keys are vertices
and the elements are distances, but when you select the next vertex to
visit, you use a priority queue where the keys (priorities) are
distances and the elements are vertices. The structure of each is
optimized for a different aspect of the algorithm, so conflating the
two would intuitively cause slowdown. With that in mind, we can
define a priority queue as just a map from <code>Int</code>s to lists of values
of that priority.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>PQueue</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>IntMap</span> <span>[</span><span>a</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Getting a next minimal element from the priority queue is easy, since
<code>IntMap</code>s already a provide a <code>minViewWithKey</code> function. Insertion is
similarly easy to write up. The empty priority queue is just an empty
<code>IntMap</code>.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>-- Retrieve an element with the lowest priority</span>
<span>pminView</span> <span>::</span> <span>PQueue</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>((</span><span>Key</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>),</span> <span>PQueue</span> <span>a</span><span>)</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Note that <code>pminView</code> already returns the new map with the minimal
element removed, so we don’t need to write another deletion function.</p>
<p>With those functions in hand, and lots of rewriting, <a href="https://github.com/siraben/haoc-2021/commit/7a52a62eee7f45b0e9612948ef43c09f22ecd78b#diff-3cc7997ef8ee621857f43efc5829f5e774da63a889e78819714e25f6501f0af7">I finally

it</a>!</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks!</h2>
<p>The results were staggering—part 2 was sped up by a factor of 2545,
which is a serious demonstration of how even if you have the right
algorithm, the choice of how you represent auxillary data in the
algorithm matters.</p>
<div><div><pre><code>benchmarking day15/part2

<p>After checking the cost centers again, a <a href="https://github.com/siraben/haoc-2021/commit/1cf5e6e37b780e46ff5947048663349978ae2509#diff-3cc7997ef8ee621857f43efc5829f5e774da63a889e78819714e25f6501f0af7">small
adjustment</a>
to how neighbors were computed reduced the mean running time to
<code>1.098</code> seconds, which amounts to a 2716 times speedup!</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Not using premade libraries was a great pedagogical constraint because
it forced me to get to the essence of an algorithm or data structure.
While implementations of Dijkstra’s algorithm exists in various
Haskell libraries, they are often too optimized or specialized to
certain structures. There’s a lot to be learned from doing things
from scratch!</p>
