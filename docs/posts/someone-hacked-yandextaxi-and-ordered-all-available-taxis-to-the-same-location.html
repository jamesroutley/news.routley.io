    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In which I re-discover the motivation to write in my blog, by writing about how I haven&#39;t written in my blog.</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><p><img alt="a cat with its mouth and eyes wide open as if screaming at a &#34;new document&#34; icon with the word &#34;WHY IS EMPTY???&#34; displayed along the top of the image" src="https://chrisrenfrow.me/blog/why-is-no-blog/./whyemptydoc.png"/></p><blockquote><p>Pictured: My brain during an attempt at putting words in a document</p></blockquote><p>For six-weeks, I had kept a habit of publishing weekly entries in my blog during my batch at RC. Somewhere along the way I lost that habit, and rather than try to make-up for it, it became easier to just let it slide. Three weeks ago, when my batch ended, I told myself I would write-up a post-mortem of my time at RC, only to find it so very difficult to just sit down and <em>do it</em>.</p><p>So, in an effort to understand where things went wrong, I&#39;m going to ponder what motivates me to write in the first place.</p><p>I&#39;ve told myself over and over that I should only write in my blog for myself and no-one else. &#34;Pretend like nobody will ever read it.&#34; But that&#39;s kind of silly, isn&#39;t it? Of course I&#39;m writing for others to read, otherwise I would just keep a journal (or more likely, nothing at all)!</p><p>So, what makes me want to write? Is it just because I see others writing and I want to join-in? Do I really think my voice needs to be added to the noise? Do I feel qualified to speak on anything others have already spoken on hundreds, if not thousands of times already? Do I think of myself so highly that I feel my &#34;unique perspective&#34; will really add anything of value to the conversation?</p><p>No. I&#39;m not so delusional as to think that anything I have to say will stand-out any more than a single droplet within a vast cloud. Sure, one day perhaps I will find myself solving a particular problem that I end-up documenting and sharing in my blog that&#39;s oh-so very niche that it only currently applies to myself and maybe the one other poor lost soul to stray down my particular path of techno-masochism.</p><p>So then, why write in a blog at all? Well, I didn&#39;t really have the answer to this firmly in mind when I sat down to write, but perhaps it is just for that one hypothetical lost soul. Maybe it&#39;s worth all the effort, for their sake. And perhaps they won&#39;t care too much about my grammatical errors or my meandering writing style if it means they get to avoid making the same mistakes I did.</p><p>Motivation is all well and good, but if I don&#39;t have the ability to focus on writing, then it&#39;s not enough. Something I struggle with constantly is the ability to focus and plan my time effectively. In the face of choosing between tweaking this website&#39;s presentation, fiddling with some obscure function in Emacs, or writing a few sentences in my long-overdue blog post, I will choose the former two almost every time.</p><p>It wouldn&#39;t surprise me if I was diagnosed with some kind of neurological disorder, in fact it would be a relief to know that it&#39;s not just a &#34;lack of character&#34; on my part. So, perhaps instead of being so hard on myself for not being able to focus on things like a &#34;normal&#34; person, I should work towards finding out how to work with the way my brain functions by seeking a neurological assessment. Though, admittedly this sounds daunting.</p><p>I started this post feeling down on myself for finding it so hard to write, but as I type out this conclusion I&#39;m feeling good about what I&#39;ve written, even if it&#39;s a little scattered and clumsy, I finally wrote <em>something</em>. And now that I&#39;ve done some self-(re-)discovery I can move forward and continue writing, for that one other person out there.</p><p>Until next time.</p></section></div>
