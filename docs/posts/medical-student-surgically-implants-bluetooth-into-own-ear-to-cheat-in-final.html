It is attached to the ear temporarily and can be removed. Such a technique was used by a Vyapam scam accused too to clear his medical exam eight years ago.”</p><p>In another incident that grabbed both national and international headlines, several parents and relatives of the students were <a href="https://blog.plover.com/news/world/asia/parents-risk-lives-climbing-exam-buildings-to-help-hundreds-of-indian-students-cheat-a128121.html" title="Parents risk lives climbing exam buildings to help hundreds of Indian students cheat">filmed scaling school walls in 2015 </a>as police stood nearby watching the mass cheating unfold in Bihar.
