They were given new answer sheets,” he said.</p><p>After questioning by the college officials, one official reportedly said that he had a skin-coloured micro Bluetooth device fixed in his ear by an ENT surgeon, reported <em>Hindustan Times.</em></p><p>Another student was caught with a small SIM-powered device and a micro Bluetooth device, but told college authorities that it was not surgically inserted and can be removed with a pin.</p><interaction data-token="5bbe30dfc3ecd7c158342081"></interaction><p>Dr Dixit told<em> The Independent</em> that the students had purposefully concealed these devices because they were asked to submit all the electronics items to the invigilators.</p><p>An internal investigation has begun in the matter by the university examination committee and devices have been sent for examination.</p><p>After the conclusion of the investigation it would be determined whether the case merits a police case for using unfair means in an exam, deputy registrar Rachna Thakur who was with the squad told the newspaper.</p><p>Renu Jain, vice chancellor of the invigilator squad that caught the two students, told PTI: &#34;We think these microphones were surgically fitted in the ears of both the students. Cases have been prepared against both the students. A committee of DAVV will take a decision in this regard.&#34;</p><p>Students getting caught in mass cheating or deploying sly means to not get caught is not uncommon in India where competition is fierce as aspirants outnumber the number of vacancies for a job and seats in colleges for courses.</p><p><a href="https://jvns.ca/topic/madhya-pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a> state was gripped under a <a href="https://jvns.ca/news/world/asia/hundreds-arrested-following-indian-exam-cheating-scandal-a125621.html" title="Hundreds arrested following Indian exam cheating scandal">massive scandal</a>, called Vyapam cheating scam, when the Supreme Court had to cancel the licenses of 634 doctors who were involved in it. During the scam, spanning the period between 2008 and 2013, several people were arrested for involvement in leaking question papers, rigging answer sheets and hiring proxies to sit for exams instead of the student.</p><p>Dr Anand Rai, the whistleblower in the Vyapam scam, said: “It is very easy to get Bluetooth fitted in the ears. It is attached to the ear temporarily and can be removed. Such a technique was used by a Vyapam scam accused too to clear his medical exam eight years ago.”</p><p>In another incident that grabbed both national and international headlines, several parents and relatives of the students were <a href="https://jvns.ca/news/world/asia/parents-risk-lives-climbing-exam-buildings-to-help-hundreds-of-indian-students-cheat-a128121.html" title="Parents risk lives climbing exam buildings to help hundreds of Indian students cheat">filmed scaling school walls in 2015 </a>as police stood nearby watching the mass cheating unfold in Bihar. The pictures went viral, hundereds were arrested, including some parents, and at least 750 students were expelled.</p></div><div id="register-wall"><div><div><p>Registration is a free and easy way to support our truly independent journalism</p><p>By registering, you will also enjoy limited access to Premium articles, exclusive newsletters, commenting, and virtual events with our leading journalists</p></div><div><form id="register-wall-form" target="_top" method="post" action-xhr="/internal-api/registration/submit" verify-xhr="/internal-api/registration/verify" custom-validation-reporting="interact-and-submit"><div id="register-wall-form-inner-wrapper"><div><div><p><label for="register-wall-form-email">Email</label></p><p>Please enter a valid email</p><p>Please enter a valid email</p></div><div><p><label for="reg-form-password">Password</label></p><p>Must be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a number</p><p>Must be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a number</p><p>Must be at least 6 characters, include an upper and lower case character and a number</p></div><div><p><label for="register-wall-form-first-name">First name</label></p><p>Please enter your first name</p><p>Special characters aren’t allowed</p><p>Please enter a name between 1 and 40 characters</p></div><div><p><label for="register-wall-form-last-name">Last name</label></p><p>Please enter your last name</p><p>Special characters aren’t allowed</p><p>Please enter a name between 1 and 40 characters</p></div><div><div><p>You must be over 18 years old to register</p><p>You must be over 18 years old to register</p><p><label for="register-wall-form-birth-year">Year of birth</label></p></div></div></div><div><p><label for="form-receive-offer">I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent. </label></p><div><p>You can opt-out at any time by signing in to your account to manage your preferences.
