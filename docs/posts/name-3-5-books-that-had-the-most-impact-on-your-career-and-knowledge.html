    <h1>Ask HN: Name 3-5 books that had the most impact on your career and knowledge?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Even though there are literally thousands of books on software engineering, not many are really useful or career changing. That said, let&#39;s try and name the books that you consider to be important in your career, how you understand the field, your current skills and depth of knowledge.</p><p>Let me start:</p><p>1. Designing Data Intensive Applications</p><p>This book doesn&#39;t need any additional praise, but it&#39;s just brilliant how it manages to be both highly technical and very readable (and even capturing).</p><p>2. The Pragmatic Programmer</p><p>I wish I had read it years ago. It reads like a great conversation with an incredibly experienced friend of yours</p><p>3. Philosophy of Software Design</p><p>It&#39;s debatable whether this book is the better replacement for Clean Code, but I really like how nuanced and undogmatic it is.</p><p>It goes without saying that with such books it&#39;s often the case that you revisit some parts or delay until you have a usecase that includes the topic discussed in the book. This is especially true for DDIA.</p><p>What are your top 3-5? Please, also add your brief comments on how exactly this book changed you :)</p></div></div></div>
