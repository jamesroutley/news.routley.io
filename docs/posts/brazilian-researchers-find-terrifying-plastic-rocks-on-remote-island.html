When the temperature rises, this plastic melts and becomes embedded with the beach&#39;s natural material.&#34;</p><div data-testid="Latest Updates" data-variant-id="article-latest-updates"><div><h3 data-testid="Heading">Latest Updates</h3><p data-testid="Body">View 2 more stories<!-- --> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 11 7" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M10.413.587a.71.71 0 0 0-1.027 0L5.5 4.474 1.613.587a.71.71 0 0 0-1.027 0 .709.709 0 0 0 0 1.027l4.4 4.4c.147.147.367.22.513.22a.79.79 0 0 0 .513-.22l4.4-4.4a.71.71 0 0 0 0-1.027h.001Z"></path></svg></p></div></div><div data-testid="gallery-0" domain="https://www.reuters.com" article_id="PQAZRWJHOFLPTGU5NFLENOSEVA" article_url="/lifestyle/science/brazilian-researchers-find-terrifying-plastic-rocks-remote-island-2023-03-15/"><div><p data-testid="Body"><b>[1/6]<!-- -->Â </b>&#34;Plastic rocks&#34; found on Trindade Island in the state of Espirito Santo is seen at the laboratory of the Federal University of Parana, in Curitiba, state of Parana, Brazil March 7, 2023.
