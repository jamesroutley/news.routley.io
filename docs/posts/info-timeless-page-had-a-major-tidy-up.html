	<h3>What is this?</h3>
	<p>Notable works I&#39;ve stumbled upon, ordered by the year (and place) of birth of their (sometimes less visible) creator. You can derive a lot of information from this simple binomial, the zeitgeist is inevitable. Lifetime work-in-progress. You may also like <a href="https://www.slowernews.com/s/underrated">underrated.</a></p>

	<h3>Why?</h3>
	<p>I wanted to read something like this - an information flood is drowning our times - but I couldn’t find it elsewhere. So, as most projects, it started while «scratching my own itch» and before becoming a website it lived as a markdown file.</p>
	<p>Making sense of chaos is a sisyphean task but I see it as a <a href="http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/">way of using my procrastination positively</a>, I’m an analist by heart.</p>

	<h3>How do you curate it?</h3>
	<p>I cherry-pick relevant stuff and list them carefully. It’s certainly affected by my biases (<a href="https://github.com/slowernews/slowernews#colophon">I’m aware of these</a>).</p>

	<h3>How often do you update this section?</h3>
	<p>Only when relevant. New listings are easy to spot.

	</p><h3 id="contribute">Can I contribute?</h3>
	<p>Open an issue or pull request <a href="https://github.com/slowernews/slowernews">the repository</a> with relevant links, corrections or suggestions. I’m curating only a few pages but <a href="https://github.com/slowernews/slowernews#so-what-pages-can-i-create">I accept pull requests creating/curating more</a> - if you can handle the burden of using raw HTML. For now, this is my filter to accept them.</p> 

	<h3>Feeling grateful?</h3>
	<p><a href="https://www.slowernews.com/s/timeless#books">Shop something</a> through my Amazon affiliate link (you pay exactly the same but it keeps my motivation high), <a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=4J432LXV72VD4">donate what you think is fair</a> or just <a href="mailto:archimodelsblog@gmail.com">say hi</a>. You can also <a href="https://www.slowernews.com/sponsor">sponsor this page</a>. I don’t want to publish intrusive ads neither data farm with yet another stupid login.</p>

	<h3>Colophon</h3>
	<p>Hand coded - fully functional without JS - and statically hosted at Netlify via a Github repository. Tufte CSS (adapted) with native darkmode. No images, no tracking (GDPR friendly analytics with <a href="https://slowernews.goatcounter.com">Goatcounter</a>) and no bloat. Ok, it uses non-standard fonts but web design is mostly typography.</p>
