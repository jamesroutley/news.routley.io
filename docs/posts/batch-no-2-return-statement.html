    <h1>Batch no. 2 return statement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My Recurse center half-batch ended yesterday. This is my reflections post. We
used to call these &#34;return statements,&#34; because that&#39;s what happens at the end
of a function, and also I guess it&#39;s like a return to normalcy. So this is my
return statement.</p>
<p>Six weeks is really not a very long time, and I was conscious of that going in.
Going to RC and being surrounded by interesting ideas and interesting people
and also, crucially, by interesting people pursuing interesting ideas... feels
like being plugged into a wall socket. Suddenly all the lights shoot on and
someone yells &#34;Go!&#34; and you&#39;re running around trying to grab everything off all
the shelves all at the same time like <a href="https://youtu.be/XRLWtxoqAHs?t=85">supermarket
sweep</a>.</p>
<p>I have always found it difficult to <em>finish</em> things at RC. There are so many
new shinies that its tough to get all the way in and through a substantial
project, especially in the alloted time. This was also my experience from my
<a href="https://blog.jfo.click/what-i-did-at-rc/">first batch</a>, that in retrospect I saw a lot of little
projects or attempts at projects or half done things, but in aggregate they
added up to something more important to my development than a polished product
would have.</p>
<p>Anyway that&#39;s just to say that I figured it&#39;d be similar this time, and so I
went in with that expectation. Sure enough, I don&#39;t have a single thing to
point to and say &#34;this is what I spent my time on.&#34; I have a few things that
<em>almost</em> fit that definition, but not really. And anyway, that&#39;s not really the
point of it for me.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-did-i-do-">So what did I do?</h2>

<ul>
<li>I wrote my own <a href="https://blog.jfo.click/an-unnamed-static-site-generator/">static site generator</a></li>
</ul>
<p>...and I&#39;ve been using it to publish this site. This is probably the closest I
came to producing a Useful Thing, as it has certainly been very useful to me,
but truth be told it was functional even before I started my batch. This was
important to me since I wanted to blog a lot. I kept feeling sniped to add
features to it, or polish it up more, but I knew that if I let that eat my time
I would regret it, and it works fine as it is, albeit a bit bare-bones.</p>

<ul>
<li>I wrote a <em>lot</em> of <a href="https://ziglang.org/">zig</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>I came in expecting to split my time between typescript (via
<a href="https://deno.land/">deno</a>) and zig, and I did use quite a bit of deno
especially while experimenting with parser combinators, but zig really stole
the show for me. I&#39;ve been tangentially involved with zig for years, and if you
know me irl you&#39;ve probably heard me talk about it already, but it&#39;s really
gaining some steam and, tbqhwy, rightfully so. It&#39;s really
invigorating to use such a low level language with a modern tooling approach,
and the C interop is <strong>chef&#39;s kiss</strong>. The community is really growing quickly,
too, and the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/gxsFFjE">discord</a> has been super
helpful and active (shout out to InKryption, who answered at least a half
dozen of my questions within minutes).</p>
<p>I published two posts about zig:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="https://blog.jfo.click/zig-translate-c-and-linking-equal-best-friends/">Zig translate-c and linking equal best friends</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.jfo.click/makin-wavs-with-zig/">Makin&#39; wavs with zig</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I would have liked to write more but got a little subsumed over the last few
weeks.</p>
<p>Zig projects dominated my hands on keyboard time, and though I didn&#39;t really
finish either of them, I spent good focused periods on both a real time audio
synthesis program and a complete rewrite of <a href="https://blog.jfo.click/sild-is-a-lisp-dialect/">Sild</a>.
The latter has been especially rewarding as it&#39;s really highlighted to me the
niceties that zig provides over C. I do plan to keep working on both of those
things, although without any intention of release.</p>

<ul>
<li>I <em>finally</em> grokked <a href="https://blog.jfo.click/building-a-tiny-little-broken-calculator-with-parser-combinators/">parser combinators</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have spent a few <em>years</em> sporadically trying to learn about parser
combinators, and it&#39;s never quite clicked. The reason is that they are <em>very</em>
haskelly, and so translating them to a non-lazy, non-functional language
presents friction, not least of which is the fact that most quality resources
and talks and posts about them are Haskell or F#. Now it&#39;s not as if I&#39;m afraid
of Haskell or something, but I just had the feeling that implementing them in a
language I&#39;m already familiar with would do more for my understanding.
I was right, but it took a lot of thinky time to get over the combination of
weird little nuances that were tripping me up. It did result in my most substantial blog
post though, so that was a positive. Really, it just feels really good to have
finally cracked that nut. I&#39;d like to sit down and write a JSON parser or
something with them now, or maybe swap out the zig sild parser for a combinator
implementation in the future...</p>

<ul>
<li>I blogged a lot</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn&#39;t write quite as much as I was hoping to, and definitely fell off the
wagon with my weekly update posts, but that&#39;s alright. I have been struggling
against my prediliction towards writing giant-ass posts, and I haven&#39;t exactly
won that war, but I&#39;m getting better, I think. Blog posts are cheap to create,
they don&#39;t all have to be canonical. On the plus side, I do have my tools set
up now, so publishing is very easy. The writing is still hard, though...</p>
<p>Ultimately that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t write more than I did. It takes <em>time</em> to write.
I mean, of course it does and I know that already, but the reality of having
limited time to spend in-batch made the writing time more expensive in context.
I do have some more drafts to work through now!</p>

<ul>
<li>I paired a <em>lot</em></li>
</ul>
<p>This was one of the best parts of the batch and I&#39;m very happy that it was so
seamless even though it was all on zoom. I paired on all sorts of stuff with
all sorts of people, and it was always fun and interesting. One of the great
benefits of RC being so unstructured is just the sheer <em>variety</em> of things
people are into. I would go from pairing on someone&#39;s web app to code
spelunking in zig zone with a few people to getting compiler flag tips while
talking about shaders... there&#39;s just so much going on all the time!</p>
<p>The people <em>really</em> are what make the Recurse Center so special, and I have a
lot of gratitude for my batch mates who were uniformly awesome.</p>

<ul>
<li>I spent a <em>lot</em> more time than I expected doing leetcode</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;m not planning to interview soon, so I didn&#39;t have a real reason to
do this, other than my desire to shiv my latent imposter syndrome. I have some
good news though: it worked! Leetcode like problems went from a source of shame
for me to just another area of study that is super interesting and fun. Data
structures and algorithms, in my mind, went from &#34;the entirety of computer
science including cutting edge research&#34; to something a <em>lot</em> more tractable,
more literal. When people say &#34;data structures and algorithms&#34; in this context
they&#39;re not usually talking about more than a dozen common data structures, and
the algorithms that flow from them. That&#39;s useful and interesting, not a
bogeyman!</p>
<p>Anyway, I likely have a longer post on what that process felt like (spoiler
alert, really good!) but for now I&#39;ll just leave it at the fact that this
constellation of realizations might very well be the most impactful take-away
for me.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-end">In the end</h2>
<p>This was a fantastic experience and I am so happy I was able to make the time
for it. RC has been a very positive force in my life and I didn&#39;t take the
opportunity to be more involved for a little while for granted. I have three
more weeks of leave before going back to work and I&#39;m going to use most of that
time for music and for video games and also maybe, <em>maybe</em> I&#39;ll read a book.
That&#39;s something that I used to do...</p>
<p>So until next time...</p>
