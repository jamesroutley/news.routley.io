<dd>
<p>From his family, on Atkinson’s Facebook page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We regret to write that our beloved husband, father, and
stepfather Bill Atkinson passed away on the night of Thursday,
June 5th, 2025, due to pancreatic cancer. He was at home in
Portola Valley in his bed, surrounded by family. We will miss him
greatly, and he will be missed by many of you, too. He was a
remarkable person, and the world will be forever different because
he lived in it. He was fascinated by consciousness, and as he has
passed on to a different level of consciousness, we wish him a
journey as meaningful as the one it has been to have him in our
lives. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, stepson,
stepdaughter, two brothers, four sisters, and dog, Poppy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the great heroes in not just Apple history, but computer history. If you want to cheer yourself up, go to Andy Hertzfeld’s Folklore.org site and (re-)read all the entries about Atkinson. Here’s just one, with <a href="https://folklore.org/Round_Rects_Are_Everywhere.html">Steve Jobs inspiring Atkinson to invent the roundrect</a>. Some of his code and algorithms are among the most efficient and elegant ever devised. The original Macintosh team was chock full of geniuses, but Atkinson might have been the most essential to making the impossible possible under the extraordinary technical limitations of that hardware. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bill+atkinson+dithering+algorithm">Atkinson’s genius dithering algorithm</a> was my inspiration for the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atkinson_dithering">Dithering</a>, my podcast with Ben Thompson. I find that effect beautiful and love that it continues to prove useful, like on the <a href="https://play.date/">Playdate</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/06/10/bitcam">apps like BitCam</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to his low-level contributions like QuickDraw, Atkinson was also <a href="https://www.folklore.org/MacPaint_Evolution.html">the creator of MacPaint</a> (which to this day stands as the model for bitmap image editors — Photoshop, I would argue, was conceptually derived directly from MacPaint) and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/06/17/hypercard">HyperCard</a> (“<a href="https://www.folklore.org/Joining_Apple_Computer.html">inspired by a mind-expanding LSD journey in 1985</a>”), the influence of which cannot be overstated.</p>

<p>What a man, what a mind.</p>
