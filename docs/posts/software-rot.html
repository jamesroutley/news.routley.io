<p><strong>Software rot</strong> is generally thought of as degradation of <a href="https://permacomputing.net/software/">software</a> due to a changing environment. For example, a program written a decade ago may no longer work with new versions of the libraries it depends on because some of them have changed without retaining backwards compatibility. This kind of thinking encourages a culture where software becomes <a href="https://permacomputing.net/obsolescence/">obsolete</a> unless it is constantly maintained.</p>

<p>A better approach might be to talk about the reliability of the environment the software depends on. Would you build a house on a bog?</p>

<p>It is often necessary to build on &#34;bogs&#34; (i.e. &#34;actively developed&#34; platforms), but it might be a good idea to also be compatible with a <a href="https://permacomputing.net/bedrock_platform/">bedrock platform</a> whose specifications are static and solid.</p>

<p>Software rot is a big issue for cultures that constantly produce new programs (such as <a href="https://permacomputing.net/games/">games</a> or <a href="https://permacomputing.net/demoscene/">demos</a>) that are not supposed to be constantly maintained after release. Programs written for classical platforms (such as <a href="https://permacomputing.net/DOS/">DOS</a> or <span><a href="https://permacomputing.net/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;from=software_rot&amp;page=NES" rel="nofollow">?</a>NES</span>) usually need no post-release maintentance at all, while those written for e.g. <span><a href="https://permacomputing.net/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;from=software_rot&amp;page=Linux" rel="nofollow">?</a>Linux</span> will likely cease working in a decade or two. Sometimes, serious <span><a href="https://permacomputing.net/ikiwiki.cgi?do=create&amp;from=software_rot&amp;page=media_archeology" rel="nofollow">?</a>media archeology</span> work (such as finding specific versions of old libraries) is needed to get a program to run again.</p>
