<p>An Apple executive lobbied against a strong right-to-repair bill in Oregon Thursday, which is the first time the company has had an employee actively outline its stance on right to repair at an open hearing. Apple’s position in Oregon shows that <a href="https://www.404media.co/apple-endorses-california-right-to-repair-bill/"><u>despite supporting a weaker right to repair law in California</u></a>, it still intends to control its own repair ecosystem. It also sets up a highly interesting fight in the state because <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-formally-endorses-right-to-repair-will-lobby-to-pass-strong-repair-laws/"><u>Google has come out in favor</u></a> of the same legislation Apple is opposing.</p><p>“It is our belief that the bill’s current language around parts pairing will undermine the security, safety, and privacy of Oregonians by forcing device manufacturers to allow the use of parts of unknown origin in consumer devices,” John Perry, Apple’s principal secure repair architect, told the legislature. </p><p>This is a quick about-face for the company, which after years of lobbying against right to repair, began to lobby for it in California last fall. The difference now is that Oregon&#39;s bill includes a critical provision that Google says it can easily comply with but that is core for Apple to maintain its dominance over the repair market.</p>
