				<p>JetBrains has released RustRover, a dedicated IDE for the <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3218074/what-is-rust-safe-fast-and-easy-software-development.html">Rust programming language</a> that combines an integrated Rust toolchain with support for AI assistance through an optional plugin and subscription.</p><p><a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/2024/05/21/rustrover-is-released-and-includes-a-free-non-commercial-option/" rel="nofollow">Announced May 21</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/" rel="nofollow">RustRover</a> is positioned to simplify the Rust coding experience while “unlocking the language’s full potential,” JetBrains said. Capabilities include real-time feedback, code suggestions, simplified toolchain management, and team collaboration.</p><p>JetBrains also rolled out a new licensing model. RustRover is available through a paid commercial license or a free non-commercial license, the latter for individuals using RustRover for non-commercial purposes.</p><p>Previously, JetBrains offered <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/" rel="nofollow">IntelliJ Rust</a>, an open-source Rust plugin for IntelliJ IDEs. With RustRover the company aims to provide a dedicated product with enhanced functionality for the growing Rust developer community. JetBrains also has been previewing a multi-language editor and IDE, called <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3664112/jetbrains-fleet-the-future-of-ides.html">JetBrains Fleet</a>, that supports Rust development.</p><p>Key features of RustRover include:</p><ul>
<li>Rust toolchain support including support for the Rust compiler.</li>
<li>Version control system integration, with <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3267565/what-is-github-more-than-git-version-control-in-the-cloud.html">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3654955/what-is-git-version-control-for-collaborative-programming.html">Git</a> support. Users are able to streamline collaboration and control for teams.</li>
<li>Error detection and real-time feedback for debugging.</li>
<li>Support for front-end technologies and databases.</li>
<li>Permissive completion and parsing including smart code suggestions even in unconventional contexts.</li>
<li>Unit testing integration for testing, rerunning failed tests, and resolving errors.</li>
</ul><p>RustRover has natural similarities to JetBrains’ other language-specific IDEs including <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3602670/pycharm-python-ide-backs-apple-silicon.html">PyCharm</a> for <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3204016/what-is-python-powerful-intuitive-programming.html">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3630389/jetbrains-go-language-ide-prepares-for-generics.html">GoLand</a> for <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3198928/whats-the-go-language-really-good-for.html">Go</a>, and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3692291/jetbrains-updates-ides-for-java-javascript-ruby.html">RubyMine</a> for <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3687219/whatever-happened-to-ruby.html">Ruby</a>. All support the <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22282-jetbrains-ai-assistant" rel="nofollow">JetBrains AI Assistant plugin</a>, which provides AI-powered code suggestions, code explanations, and code chat through a JetBrains AI subscription.</p>
