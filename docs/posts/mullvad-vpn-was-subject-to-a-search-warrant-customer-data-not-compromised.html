    <h1>Mullvad VPN was subject to a search warrant. Customer data not compromised</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>On April 18 at least six police officers from the National Operations Department (NOA) of the Swedish Police visited the Mullvad VPN office in Gothenburg with a search warrant.</p>

<p>In line with our <a href="https://mullvad.net/help/tag/policies/">policies</a> such customer data did not exist. We argued they had no reason to expect to find what they were looking for and any seizures would therefore be illegal under Swedish law. After demonstrating that this is indeed how our service works and them consulting the prosecutor they left without taking anything and without any customer information.</p>
