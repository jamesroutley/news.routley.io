<p><span>With the recent market downturn, a lot of candidates and Krakenites have been asking, “What does this mean!?” Our response: “First time?”</span></p>
<p><span>What it means is it’s once again time to build. It’s time to remember why we’re doing this: The Mission of bringing financial freedom and inclusion to the billions of people suffering from financial exclusion, hyperinflation, and a broken system that disproportionately leaves the poor out in the cold. It’s time to think about taking more of your paycheck in bitcoin because the fundamentals have only improved. It’s time to ask, is there anything else we can do?</span></p>
<p><span>We have not adjusted our hiring plan, and we do not intend to make any layoffs. We have <a href="https://www.kraken.com/careers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 500 roles to fill</a> during the remainder of the year, and believe bear markets are fantastic at weeding out the applicants chasing hype from the true believers in our mission.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s why, despite a steep decline in crypto prices and an uncertain macro environment, we’ve taken this opportunity to align our internal culture around a set of shared values we feel will keep us agile, focused, and competitive as we execute on our mission in the years ahead. </span></p>
<p><span>Make no mistake, at Kraken, we believe cryptocurrency is a once-in-a-generation technology, one that will improve the lives of billions around the globe living without adequate financial services or equal economic opportunity.</span></p>
<p>Below, we summarize a few of the commitments driving our hiring ethos:</p>
<h2><b>Belief in </b><b><i>The Mission</i></b><b> is a Must</b></h2>
<p><span>Crypto is to money what the Internet is to information — it is freeing, democratizing, equalizing. Today, billions of people are suffering as a direct result of a highly exclusionary and discriminatory financial system. Kraken was founded to accelerate the adoption of crypto, and to enable financial freedom and inclusion for all. It’s the unwavering north star that underpins all of our key decisions and we expect each and every one of our employees to commit their hearts and minds to this mission every day.</span></p>
<h2><b>Keep Up with Crypto or Fall Behind</b></h2>
<p><span>You don’t need to be an expert coming in, but you can’t be a noob for long. Crypto is moving at light speed and the company must always be prepared to pivot based on external factors outside of our control. Time must be dedicated to learning the fundamentals and staying abreast of the latest developments which could impact our clients and the work we’re doing. We expect each Krakenite to spend a few hours each week on education. Some roles may require more.</span></p>
<h2><b>More Pirate than Professional</b></h2>
<p><span>Krakenites are focused on outcomes, which is why we value skill and knowledge above credentials and presentation. It’s why we work remotely in pajamas rather than from offices in suits. We may look like a motley crew of misfits, but we run a tight ship. Of course, we keep business costumes in the trunk for special occasions.</span></p>
<h2><b>Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Sound Money</b></h2>
<p><span>We will never ask that our employees adopt any specific political ideology as a requirement for our workplace. That said, we ask that our employees respect the individual rights, privacy, and freedoms of others. Crypto is a freedom movement, and Kraken will remain a freedom company.</span></p>
<h2><b>Differences of Opinion</b></h2>
<p><span>If nobody is ever offended, we either don’t have enough diversity of thought or we don’t have enough transparency in communication. We recognize that hurt feelings are inevitable in a global organization that is optimizing for team outcomes above individual sentiment. The ideal Krakenite is thick-skinned and well intentioned.</span></p>

<p><span>In commitment to these values, we also expanded our permanent benefits program to make moving on a bit easier for anyone who feels it’s time for the next chapter in their career. </span></p>
<p><span>Whether they feel they cannot align with our culture and values, or for other reasons, we want everyone to be happy in their work. The transition program will always be available, and will allow people to have the time and resources needed to pursue the next chapter of their career.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to the hundreds of roles we have open, we’ll also be rehiring for positions that become vacant as a result of the transition program. </span></p>
<p><span>As one of the oldest and most trusted crypto companies in the world, we’ve been building throughout the many market cycles we’ve seen over the past decade. What guides us are not the short-term opportunities to maximize profit, but our belief that crypto has the potential to improve the lives of billions of people around the world. </span></p>
<p><span>At Kraken, we’re not afraid to make bold, difficult choices to support the crypto movement, and we’re excited to start conversations with eager job seekers who support our mission and values.</span></p>
