    <h1>Ask HN: Solopreneurs, how do you maintain a professional/social network?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>I quit my job a few weeks ago to focus on a business that I want to bootstrap on my own. What was once 8+ hours of Slack messages a day, non-stop emails, and regular meetings has turned to near silence.<p>I don&#39;t miss the constant Slack messages and Zoom fatigue but now I literally have no social contact when working professionally, aside from customer interviews/meetings.</p><p>Curious how solopreneurs deal with this? Any communities out there?</p></div></div>
