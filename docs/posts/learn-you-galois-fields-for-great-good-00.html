<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is the introduction to a series on Abstract Algebra. In particular, our focus will be on Galois Fields (also known as Finite Fields) and their applications in Computer Science. This is a project I&#39;ve been excited about for many years now, but have been too busy to dedicate the adequate effort to meet my perfectionism standards (yay perfectionism!).</p>
<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>Many moons back I was self-learning Galois Fields for some erasure coding theory applications. I was quite disappointed with the lack of accessible resources for computer scientists.
Many resources assumed either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Its beyond your skill level so let&#39;s oversimplify (<code>&#34;it&#39;s hard, don&#39;t worry about it&#34;</code>), or</li>
<li>You had prior Pure Math studies in Abstract Algebra (<code>&#34;it&#39;s easy, just use jargon jargon jargon&#34;</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, Abstract Algebra is not standard subject matter in most computer science curriculums. Often computer science mathematics start and end
with Discrete Math. If you&#39;re lucky, maybe you&#39;ve also been exposed to Linear Algebra.</p>
<p>So, ultimately, I ended up self-learning Abstract Algebra from a pure math textbook. But for the great majority of computer scientists, there has to be a better way.
This series intends to fill this gap. This is the gentle step-by-step approach with applications implemented with actual code. It&#39;s the intro I wanted when I was starting out.</p>
<h3>What is this subject?</h3>
<p>Abstract algebra is a beautiful subject. It&#39;s the idea that the numbers you&#39;re familiar with don&#39;t matter. The numbers are just
arbitrary labels. What matters is the relationships they have with other numbers when you add or multiply them. If the numbers
don&#39;t matter, then we can swap those labels for different labels and all the normal math rules will still work.</p>
<p>For example, we could create an algebra that allows us to add or multiply colors:</p>
<p><img src="https://xorvoid.com/color_arithmetic.png" alt="a double rainbow?"/></p>
<p>And this is what makes the subject abstract and confusing. How can you just say that numbers don&#39;t matter? It doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>
<p><img src="https://xorvoid.com/jackie_chan_confused_numbers.jpg" alt="even jackie struggles at math" width="300"/></p>
<p>And even so, why would we want to study this? Why would a computer scientist care?</p>
<p>Well, we use computer algorithms to manipulate data. We encode/decode it, we encrypt/decrypt it, we detect corruption, etc.
Wouldn&#39;t it be great if we could use normal math to do those things? Wouldn&#39;t it be great if would could add or multiply
an 8-bit byte by an 8-bit byte and get another 8-bit byte? And if we could do that, could we also do Linear Algebra over Data? Yes, yes, and more yes.
This is why studying Abstract Algebra is worthwhile.</p>

<p>(Hint: Neither 263 nor 9282 are answers, they are not 8-bit numbers)</p>
<p>You can also make quirky blog posts that make your friends think you&#39;ve gone crazy, like <a href="https://xorvoid.com/milk_and_cookies.html">milk and cookies</a> ü•õ üç™ üòä</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>The applications and algorithms are staggering. You interact with implementations of abstract algebra everyday: CRC,
AES Encryption, Elliptic-Curve Cryptography, Reed-Solomon, Advanced Erasure Codes, Data Hashing/Fingerprinting, Zero-Knowledge Proofs, etc.</p>
<p>Having a solid-background in Galois Fields and Abstract Algebra is a prerequisite for understanding these applications.</p>
<h3>Approach: Step-by-step, Active Learning, and Literate Programming</h3>
<p>In this series, we will start from the very basics of theory and build up step-by-step to interesting applications such as Reed-Solomon,
AES, etc. As such, the material will be <b>very</b> cumulative. Many exercises will be included to aid understanding. Each section will build gradually,
but will assume mastery of the previous section. Active learning is <b>strongly encouraged</b>. We will expect that
readers are putting in adequate effort to grok the abstract concepts.</p>
<p>We won&#39;t assume too much mathematical background beyond high-school level algebra. However, in some applications (for example: Reed-Solomon),
familiarity with Linear Algebra will be required. We won&#39;t explain Linear Algebra since great resources already
exist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL49CF3715CB9EF31D">here</a>. You are encouraged to supplement as needed.</p>
<p>We will be including code in a Literate Programming style where appropriate.  For example, to aid understanding, we will build some interactive
command-line tools that allow you to play around with various theoretical concepts in practice. All code will be the
<a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust Programming Language</a>, but advanced features will be intentionally avoided so that the code will be readable
by most experienced computer programmers.</p>
<p>The main goal of this series is understandability and education. As such, the implementations will not be optimal. We will forgo nearly all
optimizations you&#39;d see in a production quality implementation: lookup-tables, vectorized instructions, clever representations, computer
architecture optimizations, etc. It&#39;s possible that later posts in the series will discuss optimizations, but this is not a primary goal. At the end,
we hope these implementations will serve as good reference implementations. This can have it&#39;s own merit since highly optimized algorithms are
often difficult to read and understand.</p>
<p>For active learning, I strongly encourage you to do your own implementations and to play around with the command-line tools while reading. If you&#39;d
like to open-source your implementations, I&#39;m more than happy to link them here:</p>
