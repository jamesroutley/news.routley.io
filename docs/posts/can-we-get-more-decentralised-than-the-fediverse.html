    <h1>Can we get more decentralised than the Fediverse?</h1>

<p dir="auto">I guess that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse" rel="nofollow">fediverse</a> will be as decentralised as email: a bit, but not that much. Most people will be dependent on a few major hubs, some groups might have their own hubs (e.g. company email servers), personal instances will be pretty rare. This is in contrast to personal blogging, where every Bob can easily host their own (and they often do). I mean that&#39;s already implied by the name: fediverse is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_social_network#:~:text=Differences%20between%20distributed%20and%20federated%20networks,-See%20also%3A%20peer&amp;text=Both%20kind%20of%20networks%20are,has%20no%20center%20at%20all" rel="nofollow">a federated universe, not a distributed one</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Why does this matter? Well I like not being dependent on one entity, but I would like it much more if I was dependent on no entities at all. In other words, I like to publish my own personal blog and get all the goodies of a social network, without being dependent on other micro-blogging / social content platforms.</p>
<p dir="auto">So in this writing, I&#39;m going to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>‚ùì Contemplate on why the fediverse gets federated not distributed <em>(spoilers: its push vs pull)</em></li>
<li>üß† Ideate on how could we get a distributed social system <em>(spoilers: by extending RSS)</em></li>
<li>üõ†Ô∏è Reflect on how would that look in practice <em>(spoilers: kinda weird, but I think doable?)</em></li>
</ul>
