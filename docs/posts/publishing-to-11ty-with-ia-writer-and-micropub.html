    <h1>Publishing to 11ty with iA Writer and Micropub</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><header><p><date>Monday, May 15th 2023</date></p></header><p>I wrote this blog post from [iA Writer](https://iI wrote this blog post from <a href="https://ia.net/writer">iA Writer</a> and published it directly to my <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty-powered</a> blog using the <a href="https://indieweb.org/Micropub">Micropub</a> protocol and this <a href="https://www.matsimitsu.com/blog/2020-08-27-iawriter-micropub-netlify-static-site#github-token">nice tutorial from Robert Beekman</a> showing me how to stitch this all together with <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/functions/">Netlify Functions</a>.</p><p>If everything went well, this <em>should</em> show up on my site.</p><p>I guess we&#39;ll see?</p><p>I&#39;m excited to see if this works as smoothly as I hope. I like the minimal writing environment iA Writer brings and have wanted to bring my blog-writing process into it for a while now, in the hopes it might encourage me to write more.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> It worked! Neat. Some things to note:</p><ul><li>The title is derived from the filename unless specified in the front-matter. I might want to change that behavior, but it&#39;s fine for now.</li><li>I <em>think</em> if I edit the same file locally and republish it to my blog it will update the old post... provided the slugified filename hasn&#39;t change? I guess I&#39;ll find out momentarily.<ul><li><em>Meta update</em>: I got some strange errors trying to publish an &#34;updated&#34; version of this post form iA Writer. I just copied the changes and manually update the repo. We&#39;ll see if this problem persists the next time I go to write.</li></ul></li><li>More minute management of my blog (metadata, title, directory structure for my archives, etc) would still require diving deeper into the repo... but this isn&#39;t bad! One little barrier to entry down.</li><li>My desire to manage my blog this way versus, say, setup a <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> blog or even return to WordPress kind of amuses me. If it was <em>really</em> about the writing, I think there&#39;s a strong argument for adopting a CMS like one of those. But... what can I say? I like projects.</li></ul></section></article></div></div>
