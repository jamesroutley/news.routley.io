Most people who were buying into crypto came from Turkey, Singapore, the UK, and the U.S. during that time.</p><p>Economists noted that “risk-seeking” young men under 35 are the main segment of new bitcoin investors, according to the report. Even more interesting, those newfound crypto investors aren’t getting engaged in the idea of crypto because of any high-minded ideals of decentralized finance or breaking away from big banks, but because they’re hoping to make bank after being suckered in with promises of big returns for minimal effort.</p><p>If you’re a crypto critic, then this working paper might do nothing except confirm your own biases. However, the report did assume that a user purchased bitcoin when they downloaded a crypto app. The economists found that 73% of users downloaded their crypto app when the price of bitcoin was on the rise, going above $20,000. If a user bought $100 worth of bitcoin during the months that followed, then a median investor would have lost, for example, $431, or 48% of their $900 investment.</p><p>Still, the study is focused on two major events in recent crypto history that helps to inform its conclusions.

Researchers’ other studies of bitcoin prices narrowed the variables even more, making the correlation between prices and new users appear to hold the same trajectory.</p><p>And here’s the kicker, the people holding a lot of bitcoin, the so-called crypto “whales” or even the “humpbacks” tend to sell during periods of price increases.
