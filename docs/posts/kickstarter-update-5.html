    <h1>Kickstarter Update #5</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Well, shit.</p>
<p>Last month I said I would need to write one thousand words a day. I did not do that. My current word count is 15,337, up from last months 14,225. My only saving grace is I did delete one story that made no sense, and was pretty short (around 500 words written), and replace it with something I like a lot so far.</p>
<p>Shout out to Tracy and Carl for the encouraging text messages around writing. Receiving those did get me to write more those days than I probably would have normally.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let&#39;s do some rounding and say I need to write 55,000 words before July 1st, 2025.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s what I said <a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/post/761">last month</a>. That&#39;s essentially still true, just ~30 days have passed. So now there are 29 days until July 1st. That&#39;s almost two thousand words a day... which I&#39;m not going to be able to do. I am going to try and keep to my goal last month of one thousand words a day, and see where I am on July 1st, and evaluate from there.</p>
<p>In terms of distractions last month, I had two guests: my friend Chris from High School visited for five days, and Melissa visited for seven. Both of those were visits were wonderful, but definitely impeded writing.</p>
<p>The other thing I am incredibly proud of is I performed music in front of people for the first time since... Elementary school? That was a blast, and now I have another show to perform July 12th. Making, composing and performing music has been a good creative outlet, and it has been inspiring to help me write. It is a competing use of time outside of work, but the positive feedback I received made me more excited to create and share more.</p>
<p>Given that, I think my goal for this week should be to finish one story (i.e. writing not editing) and then share it. Partially because it&#39;s a better milestone for me than raw output numbers, but also so I can get some feedback.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your encouraging words of feedback, please keep it coming.</p>
<p>/Nat</p></div></div>
