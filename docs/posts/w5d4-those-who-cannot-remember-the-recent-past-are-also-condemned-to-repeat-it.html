      <div><p>My notes on what I&#39;m doing daily have become more sparse, note to self to be more verbose.</p><p>What is in my notes is reading Vicki Boykis&#39; <a href="https://vickiboykis.com/2023/07/18/what-we-dont-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-building-ai-apps/">post</a>Â &#34;What we don&#39;t talk about when we talk about building AI apps&#34;. In particular, even though we&#39;re moving into this new paradigm of LLMs, we still have to contend with bloated Docker containers. The post describes images with deep learning libraries as large as 10 GB!</p><p>This actually reminded me of work I did at Airtable to reduce Docker image size, by<br/></p><ol>
<li>Reordering the Docker file to have instructions that update less frequently higher in the file,</li>
<li>Removing unused Python modules, and</li>
<li>Setting the AWS Codebuild to git deep vs shallow copy</li>
</ol><p>I know, it&#39;s nothing fancy. The last one was particularly counter-intuitive, but the AWS rep said they&#39;re using a Go git client and apparently that made a difference (it&#39;s also unclear the last hack still works). That said, all-in-all a 60% image reduction size.</p><p>Modal <a href="https://erikbern.com/2022/12/07/what-ive-been-working-on-modal.html">discusses</a> building a Docker-compatible custom container runner, image builder and filesystem. Nice.</p></div>
