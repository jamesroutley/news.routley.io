					<h3>February 01, 2023</h3>
					<p>This morning I received an interesting scam email. It might not be a new scam, but it was the first time I’d seen it.</p>

<p><img src="https://anderegg.s3.amazonaws.com/paypal-scam.png" width="454" height="502" alt="An image of an invoice email with a payment button. Includes the following body text: Seller note to customer: Dear Customer, You sent a payment of $479.00 USD to Coinbase Corporation. If you did not make this payment or to cancel this transaction , please call our Help Desk number: PHONE NUMBER REDACTED. Cancellation after 24 hours from this email won&#39;t be valid for a refund. Have a great day! PayPal® Help Desk PHONE NUMBER REDACTED"/></p>

<p>Inspecting the source, the email looked like it actually came from PayPal (SPF, DKIM, and DMARC all passed). The button also linked to what looked like a legitimate PayPal URL (starting with “<em>https://www.paypal.com/invoice</em>”). It took a second to dawn on me that it was a legit email. I had just been sent a random “invoice” from a scammer.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/how-do-i-create-and-send-an-invoice-help319">PayPal has documentation on how to send an such an invoice</a>, which also currently includes a link at the top <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/cshelp/article/Help201#Invoice">mentioning this sort of scam</a>.</p>

<p>There was also a note in the footer of the email:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Don’t know this seller?</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started out thinking this was a very sophisticated phishing attempt, but it turned out to be quite low-tech. Still, I think it’s rather clever (poor punctuation on the “seller note” aside). The note about cancellations only being valid within 24 hours is an anxiety-heightening touch.</p>

<p>It also seems like a convenience feature that PayPal should consider locking down. I immediately assumed this was some form of scam and was only interested in the technical details. It seems far too easy to pull off, and I worry that others might fall for it.</p>
