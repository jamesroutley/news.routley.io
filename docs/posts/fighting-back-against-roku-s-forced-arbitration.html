    <h1>Ask HN: Fighting back against Roku&#39;s forced arbitration?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I received an email a few days ago from Roku telling me that they&#39;ve updated their dispute resolution terms to require forced arbitration:</p><p>https://docs.roku.com/published/disputeresolution/en/us</p><p>The new terms are obviously skewed entirely in Roku&#39;s favor. They say that consumers can&#39;t sue Roku in court and can&#39;t participate in class-action lawsuits.</p><p>You can opt-out, a detail they conveniently omitted in the notification email, but it has to be in writing within 30 days.</p><p>It irritates me that Roku and other corporations are allowed to force millions of customers into spending an hour or so to read these new terms and send a letter in the mail.</p><p>Are there things that I can do as a consumer to fight back against this bad behavior by Roku? In the long term, I&#39;ll support candidates and federal bills that make forced arbitration illegal, but in the short term, what can I do to discourage this behavior by Roku and other companies?</p></div></div></div>
