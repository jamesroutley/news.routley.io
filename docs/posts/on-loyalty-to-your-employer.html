  <p>I’ve just returned to London having spent the past two weeks back home in Cork where I spent an awful lot of time with my father, a man who set up his first ever email account less than a year ago and has spent the past 30 years working for the same employer. My Dad is the antithesis of the tech industry in every sense.</p><p>Considering the average ‘career’ with each employer in the tech industry is a touch under three years, the idea of spending 30 years working for the same employer is mind boggling. Despite this enormous disparity, I’m constantly witness to colleagues in the tech industry posting on LinkedIn about how great their employer is and why everyone should drop everything and come and work with them, only for them to announce a few short years later that they are moving on “to bigger and better things”.</p><p>I’m going to be the first to hold my hands up and admit to being extremely guilty of doing exactly that on a regular basis in the past. I work in recruitment. Employers pay me a lot of money to wax lyrical about how great they are. They pay me to convince you that the grass is not only greener, but their grass is more flexible and inclusive too. So how do I reconcile my apathy towards every employer claiming to be the best, and my ability to do a good job?</p><h3><strong>Transparency &amp; Honesty</strong></h3><p>My criteria for vetting an employer worth working with is very straightforward. Anything beyond these four criteria is a bonus (and extremely subjective) but the four criteria below are my absolute zero compromise criteria.</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong><em>Do you pay reasonable salaries?<br/></em></strong>Fortunately, due to my line of work, asking for specifics around salaries is par for the course and not something an employer can easily lie about. To put it simply, if your salaries aren’t at least competitive then we’re wasting each other’s time. Pay fairly or pay well and we’re off to a good start.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Do you treat your people well?<br/></em></strong>Glassdoor is your friend. If there are a slew of negative comments, look for consistencies. Were they all posted around the same time? Are there consistent themes? Raise these points and ask for the employers perspective. A quality employer will be honest and highlight what steps they took to address those issues. Not every company has a helpful Glassdoor profile (a lot of startups have yet to be reviewed) so take to social media, and look up current and former employees to see if there are any red flags.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Are you financially secure?<br/></em></strong>This is startup 101 folks. Do your due diligence. Companies House, Crunchbase, etc are a good start. Enquire about their runway (how long they can survive if their current income and expenses stay constant). If they aren’t willing to be open and honest about their finances, walk away immediately.</p></li><li><p><strong><em>Are you open to trying new things?<br/></em></strong>This criteria is quite specific to the work I do and may not be universally applicable. If you’re asking me to team up with you to improve your ability to hire people then you categorically need to be open and willing to try new things. No amount of money will be enough to convince me to join your company and follow your same old tired recipe just because it worked well a couple of times in the past.</p></li></ol><p>If you hit all of the above criteria then I can do the thing that enables me to convince great people to work for your company. I can be absolutely transparent and honest with people.</p><h3><strong>Delicious Kool-Aid</strong></h3>
