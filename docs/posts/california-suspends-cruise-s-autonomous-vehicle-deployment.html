    <h1>California suspends Cruise&#39;s autonomous vehicle deployment</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div confirmation_email_sent_page_url="/confirmationsent/" legal_marketing_page_url="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products/reuters-legal-news" sign_in_page_url="/account/sign-in/" sign_up_page_url="/account/register/sign-up/" terms_page_url="/info-pages/terms-of-use/"><div><div><p data-testid="paragraph-0">SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - California on Tuesday ordered General Motors&#39; <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/GM.N" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">(GM.N)</a> Cruise unit to remove its driverless cars from state roads, calling the vehicles a risk to the public and saying the company had &#34;misrepresented&#34; the safety of the technology.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-1">California&#39;s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) said it suspended Cruise&#39;s autonomous vehicle deployment and driverless testing permit, ending efforts by the company for the time being to test the cars without safety drivers.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">&#34;Based upon the performance of the vehicles, the department determines the manufacturer&#39;s vehicles are not safe for the public&#39;s operation,&#34; the DMV said in a statement, citing &#34;an unreasonable risk to public safety.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">The DMV added that Cruise had &#34;misrepresented any information related to safety of the autonomous technology of its vehicles.&#34; The state agency said Cruise is allowed to challenge the suspension within five days. The company did not say if it planned to do that.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">The suspension, following a series of accidents involving Cruise vehicles, is a major setback to the self-driving business that GM has called a major growth opportunity and to the autonomous vehicle (AV) industry. But unionized transit workers and <a data-testid="Link" href="https://teonbrooks.com/blog/San%20Francisco%20drives%20tech;%20will%20it%20drive%20away%20robot%20taxis?" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">other critics</a> of robotaxis hailed the suspension, which was effective immediately.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">&#34;This could be a big blow to Cruise,&#34; said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina. &#34;This plays into the narrative about the technology and the companies failing. The whole industry will suffer as a result.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Cruise said in a statement: &#34;We will be pausing operations of our driverless AVs in San Francisco. Ultimately, we develop and deploy autonomous vehicles in an effort to save lives.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Cruise said the DMV was reviewing an Oct. 2 incident, where one of its self-driving vehicles was braking but did not avoid <a data-testid="Link" href="https://teonbrooks.com/world/us/us-agency-california-gathering-details-self-driving-crash-2023-10-03/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">striking a pedestrian</a> previously struck by a hit-and-run driver.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">&#34;When the AV tried to pull over, it continued before coming to a final stop, pulling the pedestrian forward,&#34; Cruise said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">&#34;Our teams are currently doing an analysis to identify potential enhancements to the AV&#39;s response to this kind of extremely rare event,&#34; it added.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">The DMV order said Cruise had not initially disclosed all video footage of the accident and said &#34;Cruise&#39;s vehicles may lack the ability to respond in a safe and appropriate manner during incidents involving a pedestrian.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">Cruise could not immediately be reached to comment on DMV report the company had not initially shared all videos of the incident.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">GM executives have repeatedly called Cruise a giant growth opportunity, repeating that view during an earnings conference call on Tuesday before California&#39;s DMV announced its decision.</p><div data-testid="gallery-0"><div><div><p data-testid="Body"><b data-testid="Body">[1/2]</b><span>A close up of a Bolt EV car is seen during a media event by Cruise, GM’s autonomous car unit,  in San Francisco, California, U.S. November 28, 2017.
