    <h1>Monumental (if correct) advance in number theory posted to ArXiv by Yitang Zhang</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Yitang Zhang, the mathematician behind the 2013 breakthrough on bounded gaps in primes, posted to the arxiv today a result which (if correct) comes close to proving the nonexistence of Landau--Siegel zeros: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02515" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02515</a>.</p><p>To give a sense of the scale of this claim: If correct, Zhang&#39;s work is the most significant progress towards the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis in a century. Moreover, I think this result would not only be a more significant advance than Zhang&#39;s previous breakthrough, but also constitute a larger leap for number theory than Wiles&#39; 1994 proof of Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem (which was, in my opinion, the greatest single achievement by an individual mathematician in the 20th century).</p><p>Some discussion / explanation of Siegel zeros and Zhang&#39;s claim can be found here:</p><p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/math/comments/y93a86/eliundergraduate_the_hype_around_yitang_zhangs/" rel="nofollow">https://old.reddit.com/r/math/comments/y93a86/eliundergradua...</a></p><p><a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/433949/consequences-resulting-from-yitang-zhangs-latest-claimed-results-on-landau-sieg" rel="nofollow">https://mathoverflow.net/questions/433949/consequences-resul...</a></p><p>An account of Zhang&#39;s remarkable story (and his previous breakthrough) can be found here.
