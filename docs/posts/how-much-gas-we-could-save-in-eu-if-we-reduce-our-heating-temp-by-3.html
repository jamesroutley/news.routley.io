    <h1>Ask HN: How much gas we could save in EU if we reduce our heating temp by 3°?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>This question is related to the potential SWIFT block that might happen any time soon.<p>It sounds maybe naive but I was thinking that if we almost all turn down our heating system by ~3° Celsius (compared to our current settings) we could potentially save gas consumption that can be better used for other purposes. What do you think?</p></div></div>
