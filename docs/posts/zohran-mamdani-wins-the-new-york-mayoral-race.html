    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p id="anchor-e2060e">Meanwhile, Republicans are eager to turn Mamdani’s left-wing platform into a wedge issue in competitive races far beyond New York City’s borders.</p><p id="anchor-7c0f40">NBC News exit polling found that Mamdani won across racial demographics — with white, Black, Latino, Asian and voters of other races all backing his candidacy over Cuomo’s and Sliwa’s.</p><p id="anchor-59815a">Younger voters overwhelmingly backed Mamdani, with NBC News exit polling showing that voters under 45 years old favored him over Cuomo by 43 points. Voters over 45, meanwhile, backed Cuomo by a 10-point margin.</p><p id="anchor-5d083c">Education played a big role, too, the exit polling showed. And <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/new-york-city-divide-shaping-contentious-mayoral-race-rcna233912" target="_blank">one of the biggest divides</a> in the election was between New Yorkers who were born in the city and those who had moved to New York within the last 10 years.</p><p id="anchor-037249">Meanwhile, with Mamdani’s pro-Palestinian activism having become a key issue in the race, NBC News exit polling found that Jewish voters favored Cuomo over Mamdani by 29 points, 60% to 31%.</p><p id="anchor-29a217">Speaking to supporters after his defeat on Tuesday, Cuomo thanked Adams, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and former New York Gov.

This campaign was to contest the philosophies that are shaping the Democratic Party, the future of this city and the future of this country. And this coalition transcended normal partisan politics.”</p><p id="anchor-50e30c">The closing weeks of the race turned into a brawl between Mamdani and Cuomo, the onetime front-runner who spent the general election trying to play catch-up. The two had heated debates in recent weeks, with Cuomo calling Mamdani a “divisive force in New York” while Mamdani painted Cuomo as Trump’s “puppet.”</p><p id="anchor-2e99c4">Trump made a late jump into the race Monday night, endorsing Cuomo on social media and saying a vote for Sliwa, the Republican nominee, was essentially a vote for Mamdani in the split general election field.</p><p id="anchor-746b05">Interestingly, exit polling showed self-identified Republicans favored Cuomo over Sliwa, with 61% of Republicans him while just 35% backed Sliwa.</p></div></div></div>
