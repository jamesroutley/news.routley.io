    <h1>Why can&#39;t HTML alone do includes?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
<p>I’m obsessed with this basic web need. </p>



<p>You’ve got three pages:</p>



<ul>
<li>index.html</li>



<li>about.html</li>



<li>contact.html</li>
</ul>



<p>You need to put <strong>the same</strong> header on all three pages. </p>



<p>Our developer brains scream at us to ensure that we’re not copying the exact code three times, we’re creating the header <strong>once<em> </em></strong>then “including” it on the three (or a thousand) other pages.</p>

<p>We don’t need to list them all here. I <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-simplest-ways-to-handle-html-includes/">documented <em>some</em> of them</a> one time, but there are many more. </p>



<p>We’ve got JavaScript to go <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch">fetch</a> the HTML and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentElement">insert</a> it. We’ve got <a href="https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/ssi.html">old school web server directives</a>. Any <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/">static site generator</a> can do it. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-include">Task runners</a> can do it. <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/partials.html">Templating languages</a> tend to have include functionality. Any <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php">backend language</a> can generate HTML on the fly. I’ve seen several <a href="https://www.keithcirkel.co.uk/i-html/">Web Components</a> purpose-built for this. We’ve got <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, which technically is a pure HTML solution, but they are bad for overall performance, accessibility, and generally extremely awkward here, but we <a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/html-includes/#another-demo%3A-including-another-html-file">can extract them</a>. We can just not worry about includes at all and trust our code editors powerful find and replace tools.</p>

<p>None of these are a straightforward HTML tag. None of these are just some HTML way of saying “go get this HTML and put it here”, like <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> is for “go get this image and put it here. </p>

<p>No, really, <em>why?</em></p>



<p>CSS can import CSS. JavaScript can import JavaScript. HTML cannot import HTML.</p>



<p>I’m sure there are reasons. Normally, web standards and browsers are all about “paving the cowpaths”, that is, providing solutions around what developers are already doing. We were reaching for third-party JavaScript to help with dates, so <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal">the web platform stepped in</a>. We were using frameworks for page transitions, so <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API">the web platform stepped in</a>. We used libraries for positioning elements next to each other safely, so <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning">the web platform stepped in</a>. There are countless examples like this.</p>



<p>I’d wager (counts fingers) pretty much <em>all</em> websites need this ability, and all of them reach for different additional non-web-standard tooling to get it done. That’s <em>weird</em>.</p>



<p>So what are those reasons?</p>



<ul>
<li>Does it wreck the <a href="https://web.dev/articles/preload-scanner">preload scanner</a>? As in, it could have very bad web performance issues?</li>



<li>Would it have to be async and thus have issues with jerky/shifty loading experiences?</li>



<li>Does it introduce some kind of complexity that harms the purity of HTML or something?</li>



<li>Is it the difficulty of handling nested includes? Circular includes?</li>



<li>Is it pushback from web hosting that a feature like this would increase web requests dramatically?</li>



<li>Would the restrictions be too strict to make it useful? Like for whatever reason it’s cool to load images and CSS and JS from other domains, but HTML would likely be restricted.</li>



<li>Is there something problematic about the idea that I haven’t listed here?</li>



<li>Is there actually no real desire for this and I’m just a weirdo thinking there is?</li>
</ul>



<p>If anyone has been a part of these discussions or knows exactly why this is, or you just have general thoughts, leave a comment!</p>
