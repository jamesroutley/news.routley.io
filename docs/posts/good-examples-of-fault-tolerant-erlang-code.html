    <h1>Ask HN: Good examples of fault-tolerant Erlang code?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN! I&#39;m trying to learn more about Erlang and how it achieves fault-tolerance. I am pretty up-to-date on the talks that Joe Armstrong gave, and I&#39;ve read his thesis.
This is already quite informative, but I wonder if there are any codebases out there which are good examples of fault-tolerance.</p><p>I&#39;m particularly curious about when to split off a new process, and what &#34;if things fail, do something simpler&#34; means in practice.</p><p>Any suggestions?</p></div></div></div>
