  <p>What is an action?</p>
<p>Well, they <em>do</em> things. What does that mean? It means something starts out some way and changes. Old states become new ones.</p>
<p>Given a transition map <code>T: a x s -&gt; s</code>, we can rewrite it as <code>a -&gt; (s -&gt; s)</code>. This means actions can be seen as maps between states, so we say <code>act: state â†’ state</code>. Because they&#39;re maps, we can compose them. The actions of <code>mix batter</code> and <code>put in oven</code> can be composed into the action <code>mix batter, THEN put in oven</code>.</p>
<h2 id="important-example">Important example.</h2>
<p>Dots and arrows. The arrows are the actions, carrying dots to new dots. Chaining arrows is the same as composing actions. Much can be represented this way.</p>
<h2 id="to-infinity">To infinity</h2>
<p>The setup is currently discrete: each action is basically a sudden jump.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s use the <em>hyperdiscrete</em> idea: hyperfinitely many infinitesimal, discrete things is a continuous object (at least after taking a standard part).</p>
<p>Imagine taking lots of actions, but each one only has a tiny influence, so each successor state is really close to its source state. Then hyperfinitely many of these actions are a flow.</p>
<p>For a visual of how discrete actions are transformed into a flow, think of an equilateral triangle, oriented counterclockwise. The vertices are the dots, and the edges are the actions, carrying one vertex to another. If we perform a walk, then we will see a 3-cycle.</p>
<p>Now go to infinitely many sides while keeping the perimeter fixed. We get a polygon that&#39;s (infinitely close to) a circle, and the walk is now a flow.</p>
<p>Following arrows gives a smooth path, such as going from the top to the bottom of the circle along the left or right half of the perimeter, which is now a circumference.</p>
<p>Most important example of a flow: motion through space.</p>
<h2 id="discrete-and-continuous">Discrete and Continuous</h2>
<p>This is just another example of the link between discrete and continuous, specifically realizing the continuous as the hyperdiscrete.</p>
