        <p>I recently realized that all the various programming philosophies are concerned with state, and can be boiled down into a simple statement about how to work with state.</p>
<p><strong>Object-Oriented</strong> - Modifying a lot of state at once is hard to get correct; encapsulate subsets of state into separate objects and allow limited manipulation of the encapsulated sub-state via methods.</p>
<p><strong>Functional</strong> - Modifying state is hard to get correct; keep it at the boundaries and keep logic pure so that it is easier to verify the logic is correct.</p>
<p><strong>Declarative</strong> - Modifying state is hard to get correct; use a language to describe how state should be manipulated and allow the machine to determine the steps required.</p>
<p><strong>Imperative</strong> - Modifying state is hard to get correct; minimize the number of conceptual layers between how the computer operates and how the code is written.</p>
<p><strong>Monolith</strong> - Modifying state distributed among many services is hard to get correct; keep it centralized.</p>
<p><strong>Service-Oriented-Architecture</strong> - Modifying all of the state in one service is hard to get correct; distribute it among multiple services.</p>
<p><strong>MicroServices</strong> - Modifying any state in a service is hard to get correct; have many services that are primarily stateless.</p>

<p>What this shows is that every programming philosophy is about how to manage state, and each philosophy comes with trade-offs. What this means is that there is no &#34;one true way&#34; to deal with state, and that each programming philosophy is useful and important in the correct domain. It also shows how important <em>minimizing</em> state is.</p>
