	<h2>A small open-source operating system for deeply-embedded computer systems.</h2>
	<p>Hubris is an operating system for microcontrollers developed by <a href="https://oxide.computer/">Oxide Computer Company</a>.
	</p><p>Hubris provides preemptive multitasking, memory isolation between
separately-compiled components, the ability to isolate crashing drivers and
restart them without affecting the rest of the system, and flexible
inter-component messaging that eliminates the need for most syscalls — in about
2000 lines of Rust. The Hubris debugger, Humility, allows us to walk up to a
running system and inspect the interaction of all tasks, or capture a dump for
offline debugging.</p>

<p>However, Hubris may be more interesting for what it doesn&#39;t have. There are no
operations for creating or destroying tasks at runtime, no dynamic resource
allocation, no driver code running in privileged mode, and no C code in the
system. This removes, by construction, a lot of the attack surface normally
present in similar systems.</p>
