<!-- cache hit 190:single/related:7ba88e1ee67c37a1bf3d15289038e5d1 --><!-- empty -->
<p>These days, many of us live online, where machine-generated content has begun to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/technology/ai-generated-content-discovered-on-news-sites-content-farms-and-product-reviews.html">pollute</a> the Internet with misinformation and noise. At a time when it&#39;s hard to know what information to trust, I felt delight when I recently learned that World Book <a href="https://www.worldbook.com/worldbookencyclopedia2023">still prints</a> an up-to-date book encyclopedia in 2023. Although the term &#34;encyclopedia&#34; is now almost synonymous with <a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>, it&#39;s refreshing to see such a sizable reference printed on paper. So I <a href="https://amzn.to/3qBdY1p" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought one</a>, and I&#39;ll tell you why.</p>

<p>Based in Chicago, World Book, Inc. first published an encyclopedia in 1917, and it has released a new edition almost every year since 1925. The company, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway">Berkshire Hathaway</a>, claims that its encyclopedia is &#34;the only general reference encyclopedia still published today.&#34; My research seems to back up this claim; it&#39;s true even for other languages. Its fiercest competitor of yore, The Encyclopedia Britannica, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/net-us-encyclopediabritannica/encyclopedia-britannica-ends-print-goes-digital-idUSBRE82C1FS20120314">ended its print run</a> in 2012 after 244 years in print.</p>
<p>In a nod to our present digital age, World Book also offers its encyclopedia as a <a href="https://www.worldbook.com/digital.aspx">subscription service</a> through the web. Yet it&#39;s the print version that mystifies and attracts my fascination. Why does it still exist?</p>
<p>&#34;Because there is still a demand!&#34; Tom Evans, World Book&#39;s editor-in-chief, told Ars over email.</p>
<p>Today, up-to-date information flows freely thanks to the Internet. It&#39;s only a Google search away. Many people rely on Wikipedia, which is a nonprofit collaborative resource, for reference purposes. Despite that, some people and organizations apparently still buy paper encyclopedias. Evans said that sales of the print edition are &#34;in the thousands&#34; and that World Book always prints just enough copies to satisfy demand.</p>

<p>A World Book rep <a href="https://qz.com/1271013/does-anyone-still-sell-world-book-encyclopedias">told Quartz</a> in 2019 that the print encyclopedia sold mostly to schools, public libraries, and homeschooling families. Today, Evans says that public and school libraries are still the company&#39;s primary customers. &#34;World Book has a loyal following of librarians who understand the importance of a general reference encyclopedia in print form, accessible to all.&#34;</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>As a kid, our family owned a 1968 edition of World Book that I relied on for school reports and projects all the way until my high school graduation in 1999, although I briefly used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta">Microsoft Encarta</a> on CD-ROM and a <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/685/retro-scan-of-the-week-the-compuserve-school-report">CompuServe encyclopedia</a> in the 1990s. At the time, even with electronic references, instantaneous, up-to-date information didn&#39;t seem as important. We were still largely operating at the speed of paper. While that concept seems foreign to us in our current world, there was a certain kind of comfort in that slowness.</p>
<p>Speaking of slow, a paper encyclopedia set certainly can&#39;t run away from you. Back in the day, our family&#39;s encyclopedia set took up a large dedicated shelf in our family room. Just like my old 1968 edition, the new print edition of World Book is a physically hefty reference. The 2023 version spans 17,000 articles spread over 14,000 pages in 22 volumes. The company says it features over 25,000 photographs, illustrations, diagrams, and maps.</p>
<p>All this paper-bound content can&#39;t possibly come cheap, you might think. And, of course, you&#39;re right. At a time when most information comes to us for free online (with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">strings attached</a>, of course), it&#39;s easy to have sticker shock at the $1,199 retail price for the 2023 edition of World Book, although shoppers might occasionally find it for as low as $799 on Amazon (to compare, the online subscription costs <a href="https://www.worldbook.com/World-Book-Online">$250 per year</a>). Earlier editions are available for much lower prices.</p>
<p>I know it may seem weird to prefer the print edition since you can get the same content in the online version in a space-saving and portable format. But with the paper version, the World Book will always be yours. It can&#39;t be edited stealthily or taken down if the company needs the server space or goes out of business.</p>
<p>So I took the plunge.</p>
