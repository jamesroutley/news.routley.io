            <h2>Answer</h2>
	<p><a href="http://www.virtualroanoke.com/conquin/fullsize/cdcc.jpg" target="_self"><img src="https://bugwhisperer.dev/blog/static-site-hosting-on-bunnynet/myndir/kaffiblettur_240602.jpg"/></a>There are many things around us that are so taken for granted that it never occurs to us to give them a second thought until we look a little closer. Coffee stains are one such thing. When coffee dries it leaves stains that are dark at the edges and lighter inside. The explanation may not be obvious but it is in fact rather simple.</p>
<p>
When a drop lands on a table, it spreads and tries to dampen as large an area as possible. Though the table surface may seem smooth there are always some imperfections where the edges of the drop will stop. This can be compared to deep ruts in a track from which it is difficult to steer a vehicle&#39;s wheels.  In the same way the movement of the edges of the drop is hindered and it needs energy to diminish its circumference on the table.</p>
<p>
Near the edge of the drop the upper surface slopes at an angle to the table surface. So the area of the drop&#39;s upper surface is greater than the area of its lower surface. Evaporation is in proportion to the drop&#39;s upper surface. So the evaporation per unit of area of the table surface is greatest at the edge of the drop.</p>
<p>
The circumference and the edges of the drop remain unchanged as liquid in the drop evaporates. Because the evaporation is faster at the edges, liquid has to flow there. When all the liquid has evaporated, proportionately more has evaporated from the edges of the area that it covered on the table. There is a strong colour agent in coffee that is carried by the flow of liquid and remains when the liquid has evaporated. So the colour agent is in higher concentrations at the edges of the drop than in the middle. The same happens if we have a clear drop of water. As it has no colour agent we cannot see the process with our bare eyes.</p>
