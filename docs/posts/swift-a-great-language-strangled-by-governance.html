Across evenings and weekends in the early 2010s, he wrote the foundations of the language we know and love today.</span></p><p><span>Apple’s senior leadership team was packed to the gills with the OG NeXT crew, all on first-name terms with Jobs, who built their careers on Objective-C. It took a </span><em>lot</em><span> of internal politicking to get the green-light for Swift.</span></p><p><span>In classic Apple secrecy, prior to the WWDC 2014 announcement, only 250 internal employees even </span><em>knew</em><span> about the project that would eventually make their codebases obsolete. </span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Lattner’s vision?</strong></p><p><span>Simple things that compose.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Next year, in 2015, Lattner achieved the unthinkable: convincing the world’s </span><a href="https://blog.jacobstechtavern.com/p/jailbreak-enemies-with-a-link-remote-execution" rel="">second-most</a><span> secretive company to </span><a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=34" rel="">open-source Swift</a><span>.</span></p><p>The open-sourced Swift language evolved over the years; driven by 3 tribes who kept each other in check:</p><ol><li><p>Lattner himself, driving his core vision and keeping a lid on tech debt.</p></li><li><p>The open-source community, who fundamentally want what’s best for the language, but in aggregate behave like a trash bag full of cats.</p></li><li><p>Apple, the behemoth that pays the Swift team’s salaries, which has an unwavering commitment to profit.</p></li></ol><p><span>In 2017, Chris buggered off to mess around with </span><a href="https://www.modular.com/company/about" rel="">AI</a><span>. Tim Cook’s MBA buddies began to wriggle their tendrils into Swift and guide it towards its next life stage.</span></p><blockquote><p>“Swift has turned into a gigantic, super complicated bag of special cases, special syntax, special stuff…”</p><p><span> — </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovYbgbrQ-v8" rel="">Chris Lattner, 2024</a></p></blockquote><p>In 2024, we are stuck with the aforementioned 217 keywords.

This might be an individual, a team at a company, or a large distributed community.</p><p>Languages all have their own rules about how changes, features, &amp; extensions are selected, designed, &amp; implemented. This is critical for a sense of stability, continuity, improvement, &amp; backwards-compatibility. For any language used by millions of developers, they need to have confidence in their livelihood.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the governance models used by the most popular and successful languages around.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/python" rel="">Python</a></strong><span> was created by </span><a href="https://x.com/gvanrossum" rel="">Guido van Rossum</a><span> in 1990 (and named after Monty Python). Guido was the BDFL (</span><em>benevolent dictator for life)</em><span>, a title which is rad as hell (and basically a euphemism for “lead maintainer”). Ultimately, the fiery debate over </span><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/759558/" rel="">assignment expressions</a><span> led to Guido’s abdication in 2018.</span></p><p><span>Today, Python is governed by a steering council of 5 engineers, who are elected annually by the hundred-ish open-source maintainers. Changes to Python are proposed via </span><a href="https://github.com/python/peps" rel="">PEPs</a><span>, on which the open-source community deliberates. Steerco gets the final say.</span></p><blockquote><p>“Python development is generally evolutionary. Python makes slow and careful steps towards new features and versions. The current steering council, while being open to all sorts of language improvement ideas also has generally a very strong focus on preserving backwards compatibility.”</p><p><span> — </span><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/40/2022/10/MSFT_Transkript_GuidovanRossum_EN.pdf" rel="">Guido van Rossum</a></p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust" rel="">Rust</a></strong><span> was initially a personal project by Graydon Hoare, which was adopted by Mozilla, his employer, and eventually became supported by the Rust Foundation — a non-profit formed by AWS, Huawei, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla. </span></p><p><span>Changes to the Rust language are welcomed from their open-source community and discussed via an </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments" rel="">RFC</a><span> process, with steering from Foundation teams such as </span><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/lang" rel="">language</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler" rel="">compiler</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/dev-tools" rel="">dev tools</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>While this might sound utopian, the Rust community, like all open-source communities, </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36101501" rel="">is not</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MD7tcupioh8" rel="">without its drama</a><span>.</span></p><blockquote><p>Each major decision in Rust starts as a Request for Comments (RFC). Everyone is invited to discuss the proposal, to work toward a shared understanding of the tradeoffs. Though sometimes arduous, this community deliberation is Rust’s secret sauce for quality.</p><p><span> —</span><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance" rel=""> Rust Governance</a><span> </span></p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin" rel="">Kotlin</a></strong><span> was created by JetBrains, the IDE company, in 2011, who </span><a href="https://www.techyourchance.com/jetbrains-invented-promotes-kotlin/" rel="">hoped to sell more copies of IntelliJ and cross-sell other dev tools</a><span>. In a huge coup, Google announced Kotlin support for Android in 2017. </span></p><p><span>Kotlin is governed by </span><a href="https://kotlinfoundation.org/" rel="">the Kotlin Foundation</a><span>, co-created by Google and JetBrains. The foundation’s board of directors appoints the </span><a href="https://kotlinfoundation.org/news/foundation-changes-oct-23/" rel="">lead language designer</a><span>, who is basically a high-ranking JetBrains engineer. Community members may submit a </span><a href="https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP" rel="">KEEP</a><span> for discussion by the community, and developers may test out </span><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.experimental/" rel="">experimental APIs</a><span> before they are finalised.</span></p><blockquote><p><span>“Language design is cast in stone,</span></p><p><span> — </span><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-evolution-principles.html#principles-of-pragmatic-evolution" rel="">Kotlin Design Team</a></p></blockquote><p>All these languages have an open-source community which proposes and discusses changes. They also have a more centralised faction which maintain and extend the language itself, and have the final say on evolution. </p><p>Fundamentally, programming language governance is all about aligning incentives. Every programming language has 3 main constituencies:</p><ol><li><p>The end-user developers who use the language day-to-day.</p></li><li><p>The community submitting (and implementing) language proposals.</p></li><li><p>The steering group with the final say.</p></li></ol><p><span>The </span><strong>end-user developers</strong><span> just want to work with a nice language. The language </span><em>is</em><span> their incentive, and they vote with their keyboards. This cohort numbers in the millions, however they actually have the least amount of influence due to extremely high language switching costs: most won’t throw away their years of experience.</span></p><p><span>The </span><strong>community</strong><span> is formed of the most passionate end-user developers, alongside a collection of full-time teams directed by the steering group. This faction generally has the purest incentives; wanting to improve their favoured language. However, they are subject to a couple of other opposing forces:</span></p><ul><li><p>Résumé-driven-development spurs engineers to take part in discussions simply to bolster their personal employability. Furthermore, hard work is hard work. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/bikeshedding#" rel="">Bikeshedding</a><span> is a common driver of behaviour: instead of focusing on the technical design of a proposal, it’s easy to take the path of least resistance and focus energy on trivia like syntax and naming. </span></p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Swift’s evolution forums are notorious for pages upon pages of syntactic bikeshedding.</p></blockquote><p><span>The </span><strong>steering group</strong><span> with decision-making authority is easily the most powerful constituency, and can have drastically different incentives based on governance structure.</span></p><p>In some instances, such as with Python or Rust, the steering group is formed of the most influential community members, aligning their imperfect set of incentives towards something resembling “what’s best for the language”. </p><p>In other cases, such as with Kotlin, the businesses that run the language have a profit motive: selling IDEs (JetBrains) and increasing the numbers and productivity of Android developers (Google). </p><p><span>Fortunately, these governance incentives align nicely with the incentives of the other constituencies:</span><strong> creating a good language will help towards these aims</strong><span>.</span></p><p>Apple and Swift creates the worst of all worlds. </p><p><span>Apple is unambiguously </span><a href="https://www.swift.org/community/#community-structure" rel="">the dictator of Swift</a><span>. They pay the salaries for most of the core team, and have the power to arbitrarily appoint project leadership team members. </span></p><p><span>Apple has the purest incentive of all: </span><strong>maximise profit for shareholders</strong><span>.</span></p><p>There’s an extent to which this profit motive aligns them with the weak cohort of millions of iOS developers. A better language means more iOS engineers, which means more apps, which means more store revenue &amp; device sales.</p><p>But this incentive puts them dangerously at odds with the open-source community that drives the language forwards. To a lesser extent, it puts them at odds with the Swift core team itself.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-5.1-released/" rel="">Swift 5.1</a></strong><span> is the canonical example of Apple not giving a sh*t about the community. It introduced </span><a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0244-opaque-result-types.md#" rel="">opaque result types</a><span> with </span><code>some</code><span>, </span><a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0255-omit-return.md" rel="">implicit returns</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0258-property-wrappers.md" rel="">property wrappers</a><span>. It even implemented </span><a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/pull/1046" rel="">function builders</a><span> in the compiler without any evolution process whatsoever!</span></p><p><span>These features together form the syntactic backbone of SwiftUI, the shiny new UI framework of the future</span><strong>™</strong><span>. Apple’s own internal timelines dictated the unilateral approval (or lack thereof) for these features, instead of giving the community a fair say. </span></p><p><span>As a result, SwiftUI looks a bit nicer than it would if we </span><code>return</code><span>ed the View explicitly.

The </span><a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/core-team-to-form-language-workgroup/55455/6" rel="">explanation for his departure</a><span>forecasted a pessimistic outlook for Swift:</span></p><blockquote><p><span>…after several discussions generating </span><a href="https://forums.swift.org/t/if-let-shorthand/54230/188" rel="">more heat than light</a><span>, when my formal proposal review comments and concerns were ignored by the unilateral accepts, and the general challenges with transparency working with core team, I decided I was just wasting my time.</span></p><p>…several community members feel they don’t understand the real motivation for the proposal, aren’t being listened to.</p><p>Many pressures (including lofty goals, fixed schedules, deep bug queues to clear, internal folks that want to review/design things before the public has access to them, and pressures outside their team) induce odd interactions with the community. </p><p>By the time things get out to us, the plans are already very far along and sometimes the individuals are attached to the designs they’ve put a lot of energy into.

Who cares if we annoy some whinging nerds? </p><p>Chris Lattner has, on podcast appearances, spoken several times about the backlog of technical debt in the compiler. This was inevitable early on, while his tiny team successfully kept millions of devs happy as he migrated their entire development environment from Objective-C, and from Swift 2 to 3.</p><p>These days, away from the light of his influence, the compiler now has extremely silly tech debt from which it may never recover.</p><p>Modern Swift is a slave to the top-down whims of the Apple MBA cabal: who prize secrecy and sneer at community input. Unshackled from Lattner’s influence, or even the relentless drive to craftsmanship imposed from Jobs, it’s all about shipping the latest proprietary profit driver.</p><p>Apple isn’t behaving unreasonably with Swift given their incentive structure.
