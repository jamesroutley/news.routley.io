The company aims to produce its first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/mammoths" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/mammoths"><u>mammoth</u></a> look-alike calves by 2028, and &#34;it is highly likely that one could see another species before then,&#34; Lamm said, referring to Colossal&#39;s other de-extinction projects.</p><p>Woolly mammoths lived in the Arctic between 300,000 and 10,000 years ago. To produce the calves, Colossal scientists will first identify the genes encoding the woolly mammoth&#39;s most emblematic physical traits, such as shaggy hair, curved tusks, fat deposits and a dome-shaped cranium. They will then insert these genes into the genome of closely related, and therefore genetically similar, Asian <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/elephants" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/land-mammals/elephants"><u>elephants</u></a> (<em>Elephas maximus</em>).</p><p>&#34;De-extinction&#34; can have different meanings — and our capability for de-extinction depends on how we define it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://palaeogenetics.com/people/36-2/" target="_blank" data-url="https://palaeogenetics.com/people/36-2/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Love Dalén</u></a>, a paleogeneticist and professor of evolutionary genomics at Stockholm University, told Live Science in an email. De-extinction in the sense of &#34;creating a form of hybrid species that looks like the extinct one by replacing a limited number of key genes&#34; is possible if there is available DNA from the extinct species, said Dalén, who sits on Colossal&#39;s advisory board. (There is no available DNA from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/dinosaurs" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/extinct-species/dinosaurs"><u>dinosaurs</u></a>, so creating a Jurassic Park is currently more of a pipe dream.)</p><p>Creating an animal that is genetically identical to the extinct species is trickier and depends on the species. For species that went extinct very recently and for which there are high-quality DNA samples, like Celia, &#34;this could be possible,&#34; Dalén said. That&#39;s not the case for mammoths, however.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"/><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-320-80.jpg" alt="An illustration of two woolly mammoths fighting on a snowy tundra" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn-1200-80.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2uAH4dpg6rE9TbtSehojn.jpg"/></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>Using DNA extracted from tusks and skin preserved in Arctic permafrost, scientists have managed to recreate large chunks of the woolly mammoth genome.

For one, de-extinct animals may be sickly, given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/woolly-mammoth-genetic-problems.html" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/woolly-mammoth-genetic-problems.html"><u>pool of available DNA</u></a> for each species is relatively small.</p><p>Sustaining populations requires a sufficient number of creatures that are genetically different enough to buffer against diseases and harmful mutations.</p><p>It&#39;s also worth considering who would be liable if large-scale mammoth reintroductions went wrong. &#34;The ecosystem has been adapting to the absence of mammoths since mammoths started going extinct,&#34; Lynch said. &#34;What if there&#39;s an unintended consequence and something bad happens?&#34;</p><p>Other experts echoed these concerns. &#34;To get some impact, you need to have a lot of animals,&#34; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sophie-Monsarrat" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sophie-Monsarrat" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Sophie Monsarrat</u></a>, an ecologist and the rewilding manager at Rewilding Europe, told Live Science.</p><p>Reintroductions can lead to clashes between humans and wildlife. &#34;In Africa, if you look at elephant conservation and reintroductions, then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2018.00235" target="_blank" data-url="https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2018.00235" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>there are conflicts</u></a>,&#34; Monsarrat said. In Kenya alone, human-elephant conflicts killed 200 people between 2010 and 2017, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/elephants/human_elephant_conflict/" target="_blank" data-url="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/knowledge_hub/endangered_species/elephants/human_elephant_conflict/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>WWF</u></a>. If scientists were to succeed in creating a viable mammoth population, they would have to roll out continent-wide education programs &#34;teaching people how to react in front of a mammoth,&#34; Monsarrat said.</p><p>The makeup of the reintroduced population matters too, Schmitz said. Brown bears (<em>Ursus arctos</em>) that were brought from Slovenia to the Italian Alps in the 2000s are thriving, but it turns out that the source population was particularly aggressive, Schmitz said. Ecologists &#34;didn&#39;t necessarily do their homework,&#34; he said. &#34;They reintroduced them, and now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/animals/bears/bear-kills-jogger-in-italian-alps-what-does-this-mean-for-the-effort-to-bring-bears-back-to-the-region" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/animals/bears/bear-kills-jogger-in-italian-alps-what-does-this-mean-for-the-effort-to-bring-bears-back-to-the-region"><u>they&#39;re attacking livestock and people</u></a>.&#34;</p><p>There&#39;s also no guarantee that animals will stay where we release them, Schmitz said. In 1995, gray wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) were reintroduced to Yellowstone National Park but have roamed far beyond the park&#39;s boundaries.<strong> </strong>&#34;If you unleash something in nature, these animals are going to find places that are the most suitable for them and may not be the places where you think they will stay,&#34; Schmitz said.</p><p>And although megaherbivores helped with carbon storage during the last ice age, &#34;restoring megafauna may just as well have a negative impact on climate change,&#34; Dalén said. For instance, mammoths could theoretically contribute to global warming by eroding the permafrost during the warm season and by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/tellusb.v38i3-4.15135" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3402/tellusb.v38i3-4.15135" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>emitting methane</u></a>, he said.
