            <span>Abstract:</span>There is probably not a black hole in the center of the sun. Despite this detail, our goal in this work to convince the reader that this question is interesting and that work studying stars with central black holes is well motivated. If primordial black holes exist then they may exist in sufficiently large numbers to explain the dark matter in the universe. While primordial black holes may form at almost any mass, the asteroid-mass window between $10^{-16} - 10^{-10} ~ \textrm{M}_\odot$ remains a viable dark matter candidate and these black holes could be captured by stars upon formation. Such a star, partially powered by accretion luminosity from a microscopic black hole in its core, has been called a `Hawking star.&#39; Stellar evolution of Hawking stars is highly nontrivial and requires detailed stellar evolution models, which were developed in our recent work. We present here full evolutionary models of solar mass Hawking stars using two accretion schemes: one with a constant radiative efficiency, and one that is new in this work that uses an adaptive radiative efficiency to model the effects of photon trapping.
