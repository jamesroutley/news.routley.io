At the same time, employee expenses have grown, even as we have introduced significant cost-cutting measures and adjusted or paused hiring plans. This is ultimately not a sustainable trajectory and we must change it.&#34;</p><p>The news comes alongside updated fourth-quarter guidance for Etsy. The company now expects gross merchandise sales to decline between 1% and 2% during the period from the year-ago quarter and revenue to increase between 2% and 3%. It&#39;s expecting adjusted EBITDA margin of between 27% and 28%, up from previous guidance of 26% to 27%. </p><p>Shares of Etsy fell 7% following the announcement.</p><p>&#34;Etsy is intensely focused on reigniting growth, driving sales for our nearly 7 million sellers around the world, and delivering value to all of our stakeholders. Today, we announced that we are reorganizing our internal structure so that we can double down on these efforts, which unfortunately means saying goodbye to approximately 225 of our colleagues,&#34; Silverman said in a statement to CNBC. </p><p>The layoffs come two days after toymaker <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-2"><a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/quotes/HAS/">Hasbro</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> announced it was cutting 1,100 employees as it grapples with soft sales that have continued into the crucial holiday shopping season. Hasbro had about 6,300 employees as of earlier this year, <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/75d5bb34-0400-4ffc-8ecb-26ceed89b963" target="_blank">according to a company fact sheet</a>.</p><p>Etsy&#39;s layoffs will cost between $25 million and $30 million, the bulk of which will be used for severance payments, employee benefits and other related costs, the company said in a securities filing<strong>.</strong> Over time, the restructuring is expected to &#34;deliver meaningful operational efficiencies and cost savings and/or cost avoidance,&#34; especially when it comes to salary costs and benefits.</p><p>The restructuring is expected to be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2024. </p><p>As part of the restructuring, Etsy&#39;s chief marketing officer Ryan Scott will be leaving the company and his position will be consolidated under the chief operating officer role, which is currently held by Raina Moskowitz, a former <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-4"><a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/quotes/AXP/">American Express</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> executive. </p><p>Etsy&#39;s chief human resources officer Kimaria Seymour will also be leaving the company and will be replaced by Toni Thompson, the company&#39;s current vice president of global people and talent strategy. </p><p>Considering the layoffs come in the middle of the holiday season when many employees are shopping for gifts for their loved ones, Etsy said it would pay affected staff through at least Jan. 2, even though the last working day for most staff will be Wednesday. </p><p>They&#39;ll receive severance of 16 weeks of base pay, plus one week for each full year of service, along with other benefits such as extended COBRA health insurance benefits and the ability to keep their company laptop.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/05/five-stocks-to-buy-before-the-year-end-according-to-the-pros.html"><em>Five stocks to buy before the year-end, according to the pros</em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/04/morgan-stanley-fund-manager-names-4-top-stocks-to-buy-on-the-cheap.html"><em>Morgan Stanley fund manager names 4 top stocks to buy &#39;on the cheap&#39;</em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/10/jpmorgan-picks-china-stocks-to-buy-now-alibabas-not-on-the-list.html"><em>JPMorgan picks China stocks to buy now.
