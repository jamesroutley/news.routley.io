                    <p>Technologists and publicists gush about how Large Language Models (LLMs) will revolutionize the way we work, learn, play, communicate, create, and connect to another. </p>
                    <p>They are right that artificial intelligence (AI) will affect nearly every aspect of our daily lives. </p>
                    <p>And they are right that by providing a way for people to talk with machines in ordinary language, LLMs constitute a dramatic step forward in making computing accessible to everyone. </p>
                    <p>Yet for all the good that AI systems will do, they will also saturate our information environment with bullshit at a scale weâ€™ve never before encountered.</p>
