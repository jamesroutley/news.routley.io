    <ul>
<li>taking recommendations for non-fiction books to read of any genre, so long as they&#39;re either very entertaining or very educational.</li>
<li>listening to a podcast on witches called <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001mc4p">witch</a> and enjoying it a lot. i think the episode on placebo/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocebo">nocebo</a> was a bit handwavey, but i&#39;m all for useful fictions.</li>
<li>&#34;most people don&#39;t know who their family are beyond their great-grandparents&#34; from the witch podcast. bold of them to assume i know anything about my great-grandparents, but i&#39;m spurred on to ask! I&#39;d probably have to go to Nigeria to look further back, and I&#39;m trying to work out if I&#39;m up for that.</li>
<li>i&#39;m not really drawn to thinking about my direct ancestors as some spiritual people are, but i would like to know definitively if there&#39;s anything more that&#39;s recoverable. i think when i&#39;m awed by the human <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_%28philosophy%29">sublime</a> I usually just think about a general person, maybe in similar categories to me personally like queer, rather than anyone blood related to me.</li>
<li>trying to use firefox and non-chromium browsers. so far i&#39;ve noticed <a href="https://speechify.com/">speechify</a> doesn&#39;t have an extension in firefox, too many tabs (or specifically gmail tabs??) seem to crash it, and i don&#39;t think it has native spellcheck.</li>
<li>pattern testing - when you check out a sewing pattern by sewing it before it&#39;s available to the public - some trousers and a bit nervous i&#39;ll run out of time. pray for me, i have until the 9th and my toile/practice fabric hasn&#39;t turned up yet!</li>
<li>bought some gorgeous fabric in the sales but i&#39;ll wait until i receive and sew it up to tell you about it i think! i&#39;m officially not allowed any more fabric (unless the vinted parcel doesn&#39;t arrive, of course) for a while.</li>
<li>been eating a lot of mince pies. drinking lots of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_%28British_drink%29">rio</a> and hotel chocolat hot chocolate (say five times fast).</li>
<li>assuming my next video will be next year at this point. if you want to join a blog/video/podcast/other online content crit and review circle, let me know! it&#39;ll probably be very techie heavy, but i&#39;d appreciate you, and you can <a href="https://olu.online/contact">email me or dm me</a>.</li>
<li>very excited that <a href="https://piccalil.li/complete-css/">complete css</a> is out!</li>
