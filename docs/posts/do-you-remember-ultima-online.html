<p><img src="https://en.karelkremel.com/wp-content/uploads/blackthorn-scaled.jpg" alt="Do you remember Ultima Online?"/></p><p>It has already been twenty-five years since we could go to Sosaria together. It was pretty new to play with other people in a graphical game. Ultima Online wasnâ€™t the first online MMORPG (although now itâ€™s assumed the term came with this game). But I do believe it was the best one. Why do I think so? I will get to it. But first, a bit of history lesson.</p>



<p><a href="https://uo.com/">Ultima Online</a> was released on 24 September 1997. If you would count closed alpha and beta, itâ€™s even older for some people, but for us mere mortals, itâ€™s twenty-five years old! What an achievement.</p>



<p>The official servers are still on, not like with some other games. While writing this post, I checked on them â€“ theyâ€™re online but empty. I have visited 10 servers and found barely anyone. And those I saw were just standing in the bank and didnâ€™t react to my attempts to communicate. It was sad. I remember the game flourishing with life those almost twenty years ago when I left.</p>



<p>But I should start at the beginning, not at the end. I was just finishing primary school and totally oblivious to UOâ€™s existence when it launched. I found out about it about two years later. But it was inaccessible to me. You needed a credit card that had enabled internet payments â€“ not doable at that point in the Czech Republic. My temporary workaround was playing on some Czech unofficial servers and waiting for any of the Czech banks to acknowledge the internet.</p>



<h3>No endgame</h3>



<p>Can you even imagine it? No endgame content. Everything is available from the beginning. No scaling of difficulty. No content to run towards? Nothing to skip because itâ€™s below your current level? As there werenâ€™t any areas scaled by character level, people were everywhere, and all the dungeons were full. And this was the time before anything was instantiated, so you could see the world flourishing with life.</p>



<h3>Equipment wasnâ€™t that important</h3>



<p>The variety of equipment wasnâ€™t significant. You didnâ€™t have fifty variants of a sword (with two hundred different visuals). There was no need to grind for better gear, spending a week in a dungeon to get â€˜the swordâ€™. And it was good, especially considering that all your equipment stayed in your dead body whenever you were killed. Free to loot by anyone.</p>



<h3>Crafting was valuable</h3>



<p>Almost all the items in the game were craftable by players. It made economic sense to craft and sell what youâ€™ve produced. Technically everything was consumable (even armour if used long enough), so every crafting skill was monetisable.</p>



<h3>Player Housing &amp; Vendors</h3>



<p>You could own a house. Your unique home. Not just another instance of a place a thousand other players have. Could anything else in the game give you more feeling of belonging somewhere? It wasnâ€™t cheap, but it was another achievement to collect enough money to get it.</p>



<h3>Shards with a limited population</h3>



<p>Shards (separated world) were a way to overcome a hardware limitation of its time. The shard limit was around 2500 simultaneously logged-in characters.</p>



<h3>No perfect build</h3>



<p>There were no hard-defined classes for the characters. You could combine any skill with others if you fit under the skill cap of 700 (seven skills to one hundred per cent). With forty-nine skills, the number of combinations was almost limitless. The skill cap was a catch, though. For a perfect build, you needed eight skills or moreâ€¦ you were always missing ðŸ˜€</p>



<h3>No pay to win</h3>



<p>There was just a monthly payment. That was it, nothing else.</p>



<h3>Cooperation</h3>



<p>So many of the game aspects promoted player cooperation.</p>



<ul><li>Surviving alone was challenging but more manageable with a friend.</li><li>Training all the crafts were time-consuming, but you could share the load with your friends.</li><li>Only player characters could fix your equipment.</li><li>Were you going away for the holidays? Ask a friend to visit your house in the meantime to keep it standing.</li><li>Shards had a small enough population to know people. To build relations.</li><li>Telling your story just to yourself is boring. You need friends to merge their stories with yours.</li><li>As you were forced to grow your character instead of buying a fully trained one, you were likely to find some friends on your way.</li></ul>



<p>The game gave us so much happiness and so much frustration too. But one could not exist without the other. It also gave me some good friends Iâ€™m keeping twenty years later.</p>

<p>To my surprise, Iâ€™ve managed to recover my old account while fact-checking my memories. There was nobody to play with. So Iâ€™ve also checked the free servers (run by enthusiasts) and found one quite close: <a href="http://uorenaissance.com/">Renaissance</a> â€“ close to what I consider the best version of Ultima Online. Sure, they have some deviations, but Iâ€™m inclined to forgive them, as theyâ€™re the closest option to my memories of the best MMORPG of my life.</p>
