<li>omg i&#39;ve been m.i.a. (tw for car crash, gore/blood in the lyrics: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZXXFkmYFTk">&#34;i&#39;ve always liked this singer i remember that you were the one that told me that her name was either mia or m.i.a.&#34;</a>)!</li>
<li>i had a blast at <a href="https://frontendnorth.com/">fen 2025</a>! had a bunch of really cool convos and all the talks were great.</li>
<li>very glad the heat has dissipated in london a bit, and enjoying the storms.</li>
<li>i started reading <em>unmasking for life</em> and <em>empire of normality</em> as i&#39;m apparently on a big understanding my autism kick! both seem good so far.</li>
<li>back on music the albums <a href="https://malblum.bandcamp.com/album/the-villain">the villain by mal blum</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCuCdnh8-13dd9gqYCDq75sY1HScrAr-O">. (period) by kesha</a> both came out recently so i&#39;m living.</li>
<li>digitised a bunch of paper planning materials. felt a lot more heavy going through all my plans since 2016 than i assumed it would, which is laughable. you thought the weight of your biggest dreams and loftiest aspirations would be light, bro?? some of the things i wanted in 2016 still haven&#39;t come to pass, so yeah, emotional!</li>
<li>i wrote a post about boycotting certain services, <a href="https://olu.online/no">no</a>. reminded me to update my <a href="https://olu.online/ai">ai</a> page, which i will try and do after writing this!</li>
<li>back to capacities/my bullshit for planning and notetaking, obsidian just has too much configurability for me to use it for planning, and i like my plans and notes to be in the same place. workflowy added ai stuff, and i&#39;d like a few more layout options, it&#39;s a bit expensive for what it is, especially since the mobile app never fit my brain very well.</li>
<li>still working on a video! it will be out before the end of the year i swear. a friend mentioned thinking about what in particular is blocking you and it&#39;s helped a lot (rather than trying to break through the block on sheer strength of will, which wasn&#39;t helping lol). i love having creative community.</li>
<li>been drinking bubble tea, squash with sparkling water and plentiful amounts of lemonade. i&#39;ve been eating salads (various), pasta, rice and bread in various combinations but rarely all together. i want garlic bread and pasta now.</li>
<li>hope you have a great week! ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
