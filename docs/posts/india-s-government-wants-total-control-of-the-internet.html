    <h1>India’s government wants total control of the internet</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p><span>Akash Banerjee isn’t</span> sure whether he’s allowed to talk about the BBC documentary <em>India: The Modi Question</em> on his YouTube channel. The documentary examines Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s alleged role in deadly riots in the West Indian state of Gujarat in 2002, and the government has worked hard to keep Indians from watching it. Screenings at universities have been banned; in one case, students said authorities <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-64371327">shut off</a> electricity and the internet to stop it being shown, and clips of the documentary itself have been removed from Twitter and YouTube after the Indian government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jan/23/india-emergency-laws-to-ban-bbc-narendra-modi-documentary">cited controversial emergency powers</a>.</p><p>“The fact is that emergency powers are for something which is a very serious grave security implication that threatens the sovereignty of the nation, the peace of the nation,” says Banerjee, a seasoned journalist who runs The Deshbhakt (“the patriot”), a satirical YouTube channel covering politics and international affairs. Using that, the government has banned a documentary that talks about “something that happened years ago.” </p><p>This has left Banerjee, whose channel has nearly 3 million regular viewers, uncertain about where the red lines are. “I don’t know if I make a video on the BBC documentary, can the government pull that off, also citing emergency powers?” Banerjee says. For the time being, he’s self-censoring, holding off on posting anything about a drama that has gripped Indian politics for weeks.</p><p>Banerjee’s reluctance to address the controversy reflects the chilling effect of the Indian government’s multidimensional squeeze on the internet. Over the past few years, the administration has handed itself new powers that tighten controls over online content, allowing authorities to legally intercept messages, break encryption, and shut down telecoms networks during moments of political turmoil. In 2021 alone, the government resorted to internet blackouts more than 100 times. Over the past 10 months, the administration has banned over 200 YouTube channels, accusing them of spreading disinformation or threatening national security. </p><p>Over the next few months, the government will add yet more legislation that will likely expand its powers. Lawyers, digital rights activists, and journalists say this amounts to an attempt to reshape the Indian internet, creating a less free, less pluralistic space for the country’s 800 million users. It’s a move that could have profound consequences beyond India’s borders, they say, forcing changes at Big Tech companies and setting norms and precedents for how the internet is governed.</p><p>“There appear to be continuing attempts to strengthen the government’s control over the digital space—whether to censor content or to shut down the internet,” says Namrata Maheshwari, Asia Pacific policy counsel at Access Now. These proposals “empower the executive to issue rules on a broad range of issues, which could be used to solidify unilateral power.”</p><p>The Indian government’s Big Tech battle began with a dispute over farm laws. In late 2020 and early 2021, tens of thousands of farmers marched on Delhi to protest proposed agricultural reforms (which were repealed by the end of 2021). The movement was <a data-offer-url="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/tractor-to-twitter-how-farmers-developed-their-social-media-plan-to-convey-their-views/articleshow/80075943.cms" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/tractor-to-twitter-how-farmers-developed-their-social-media-plan-to-convey-their-views/articleshow/80075943.cms&#34;}" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/tractor-to-twitter-how-farmers-developed-their-social-media-plan-to-convey-their-views/articleshow/80075943.cms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">mirrored online</a>, with farmers and unions using social media platforms—including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram—to galvanize support.

They spoke anonymously, as they aren’t allowed to talk to the media.</p><p>The changes to the rules were so fundamental that the tech platforms expected to get more time. “There also wasn’t enough consultation, and no one in the industry was prepared to make such a fundamental shift in their India operations,” the person said. </p><p>But as the deadline inched closer, the government made it clear that it wouldn’t budge.

The new rules allow the authorities to demand that messaging platforms identify the originator of any message when asked—something that is incompatible with WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption. WhatsApp <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/whatsapp-india-traceability-encryption/">sued the government</a> to challenge the law.

One mandates that intermediaries respond to user complaints within 24 hours and resolve them in the next 15 days; it also asks social media platforms to take down certain “contentious” content within 72 hours of reporting. Malicious mass reporting of content is already a common tactic in India.</p><p>“If 1,000 people gang up—which is not uncommon in the world of social media—and if they mass-email me, then I will be left with nothing else but to write back replies,” Banerjee says. “If it comes into play, it will be the death knell of many social media channels, especially the smaller ones.”</p><p>While the government <a data-offer-url="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/new-it-rules-designed-to-empower-ordinary-users-of-social-media-india-tells-un-11624182887737.html" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.livemint.com/news/india/new-it-rules-designed-to-empower-ordinary-users-of-social-media-india-tells-un-11624182887737.html&#34;}" href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/new-it-rules-designed-to-empower-ordinary-users-of-social-media-india-tells-un-11624182887737.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">has said</a> that the 2021 IT Rules were designed to “empower ordinary users of social media” and stop the circulation of dangerous content and financial fraud, Banerjee believes the crackdown is more about reasserting control over the media. Over the past few years, there has been a proliferation of online media, with high-profile journalists setting themselves up as independents and more of the national conversation now happening on social media. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Despite their vocal opposition to the rules, Big Tech companies have limited room to maneuvre.

And they have banned a major social media platform before. In June 2020, the government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/29/india-bans-tiktok-dozens-of-other-chinese-apps/">ordered</a> networks in India to block TikTok, along with 58 other Chinese-owned apps, after a border standoff.

But the way the government is approaching regulation suggests a different motive.</p><p>“These are two things that sort of play together—elements of growth and national security,” said Prateek Waghre, policy director at Internet Freedom Foundation. “But a side effect or consequence of this, or what you’re also seeing in subsequent drafts in the rules that are being notified, is also an increase in centralization of authority.”</p><p>For Banerjee, there are small and big signs that the public square in India is being constrained by those with power and influence. </p><p>In January, another scandal rocked the Indian establishment.

More than $110 billion has been wiped off the Adani Group’s stock market valuation since the report.
