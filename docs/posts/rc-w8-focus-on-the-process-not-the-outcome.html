    <h1>RC W8 - Focus on the process, not the outcome</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_1963945">
    
      <div><p>In thinking about my next role, I find it helpful to reconnect with friends and ex-colleagues to hear what they&#39;ve been working on, as well as to catch up on life more broadly. When I reach out and I don&#39;t hear back, it&#39;s often helpful to try again. The time of the retry might be a better time.</p><p>There are those with more definite long term goals, which they use to work backwards from. This is from Sam Altman&#39;s <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short">post</a>.</p><blockquote>
<p>Have clear goals for yourself every day, every year, and every decade.</p>

</blockquote><p>If you operate differently, that&#39;s OK. Another model is Naval Ravikant, whose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200608132908im_/https://episodes.buzzsprout.com/prc908fnlrzbdbtma85i566mn8bg">advice</a> focuses on improving the leverage you have with your time. The clip is from Samantha Ryan&#39;s podcast.<br/></p><blockquote><p>It&#39;s very important to be honest with yourself so you can actually succeed without hurting yourself, without being in self conflict all the time and without being ineffective. Because if you&#39;re effective and you just get what you want, you can trade it for other things.<br/></p></blockquote><p>A recent gem I found, credits to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/stevenqzhang_jobsearch-recruiting-interview-activity-7048686213448249345-ny4e">Steven Zhang</a>, is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVPxwh2UHOk&amp;t=562s" title="Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVPxwh2UHOk&amp;t=562s">clip</a> of Bryan Cranston telling us to focus on the process, not the outcome.</p></div>
