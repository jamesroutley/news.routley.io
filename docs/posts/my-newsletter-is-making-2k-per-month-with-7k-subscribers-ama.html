    <h1>My newsletter is making $2k per month with 7k subscribers – AMA</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Hi HN!<p>Roughly two years ago when the pandemic had people shifting to a WFH environment, I started a twice-weekly newsletter called Workspaces that gives readers a behind the scenes tour of their favorite entrepreneurs, designers, developers, etc. new desk setups.</p><p>Growth has remained consistent week to week, relying on the featured guests Twitter presence to help spread the word.</p><p>I have featured 175 workspaces to date (70+ more in the backlog) and have grown the newsletter to 7,000 subscribers while maintaining a &gt;50% open rate.</p><p>I published the fist 117 editions of the newsletter without a sponsor. I had inbound requests but I was focused on growing the subscriber base as much as possible. With the new year, I shifted this focus slightly and began offering one sponsor slot per newsletter edition.</p><p>Since then, the newsletter has been sold out weekly and the price has risen from the initial $150 to $250, earning $2,000 per month from sponsorships.</p><p>I think it’s important to note that this was not an immediate cash cow… sending out 117 editions of a newsletter without receiving a dime can be draining. You have to truly enjoy the content you are putting out (I do!).</p><p>However, I think this shows that consistency rules and as long as you continue to show up, put out great content and iterate based on feedback you will continue to see your newsletter grow and ultimately the money will come.</p><p>Happy to answer any questions around newsletter growth, finding sponsors, etc!</p></div></div>
