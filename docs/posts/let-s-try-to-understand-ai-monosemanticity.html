    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p>You’ve probably heard AI is a “black box”. No one knows how it works. Researchers simulate a weird type of pseudo-neural-tissue, “reward” it a little every time it becomes a little more like the AI they want, and eventually it becomes the AI they want. But God only knows what goes on inside of it.</p><p>This is bad for safety. For safety, it would be nice to look inside the AI and see whether it’s executing an algorithm like “do the thing” or more like “trick the humans into thinking I’m doing the thing”. But we can’t. Because we can’t look inside an AI at all. </p><p><span>Until now! </span><strong><a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html" rel="">Towards Monosemanticity</a></strong><span>, recently out of big AI company/research lab Anthropic, claims to have gazed inside an AI and seen its soul.

When you switch to a weaker AI with “only” a few hundred neurons and build special tools to automate the stimulus/analysis process, the neurons aren’t this simple. A few low-level ones respond to basic features (like curves in an image). But deep in the middle, where the real thought has to be happening, there’s nothing representing “dog”.

So it would be helpful if you could use 1,000 neurons to represent much more than 1,000 concepts.</p><p><span>Here’s a way to make two neurons represent five concepts (</span><a href="https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html" rel="">adapted from here</a><span>):</span></p><figure data-component-name="Image3Dynamic"><div><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 2912w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_4368,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 4368w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 1456w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_2912,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 2912w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_4368,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0ec5a30b-ddcb-4114-8b1d-bca34aef713f_472x393.png 4368w" width="1456"/></picture></div></div></figure><p>If neuron A is activated at 0.5, and neuron B is activated at 0, you get “dog”. </p><p>If neuron A is activated at 1, and neuron B is activated at 0.5, you get “apple”. </p><p>And so on.</p><p>The exact number of vertices in this abstract shape is a tradeoff.

It also occasionally fires on non-standard text like HTML tags.” Probably this is because you can’t really understand AIs at the real-neuron-by-real-neuron level, so the summarizing AI - having been asked to do this impossible thing - is reading tea leaves and saying random stuff.</span></p><p>But at the feature level, everything is nice and tidy! Remember, this AI is trying to predict the next token in a text. At this level, it does so intelligibly. When Feature #2663 is activated, it increases the probability of the next token being “bless”, “forbid”, “damn”, or “-zilla”.</p><p>Shouldn’t the AI be keeping the concept of God, Almighty Creator and Lord of the Universe, separate from God- as in the first half of Godzilla? Probably GPT-4 does that, but this toy AI doesn’t have enough real neurons to have enough simulated neurons / features to spare for the purpose.

They got GPT-4 to inspect each of GPT-2’s 307,200 neurons and report back on what it found.</span></p><p>It found a collection of intriguing results and random gibberish, because they hadn’t mastered the techniques described above of projecting the real neurons into simulated neurons and analyzing the simulated neurons instead. Still, it was impressively ambitious. Unlike the toy AI in the monosemanticity paper, GPT-2 is a real (albeit very small and obsolete) AI that once impressed people.</p><p>But what we really want is to be able to interpret the current generation of AIs. The Anthropic interpretability team admits we’re not there yet, for a few reasons.</p><p><em>First</em><span>, scaling the autoencoder:</span></p><blockquote><p>Scaling the application of sparse autoencoders to frontier models strikes us as one of the most important questions going forward. We&#39;re quite hopeful that these or similar methods will work – Cunningham et al.&#39;s work seems to suggest this approach can work on somewhat larger models, and we have preliminary results that point in the same direction. However, there are significant computational challenges to be overcome. Consider an autoencoder with a 100× expansion factor applied to the activations of a single MLP layer of width 10,000: it would have ~20 billion parameters. Additionally, many of these features are likely quite rare, potentially requiring the autoencoder to be trained on a substantial fraction of the large model&#39;s training corpus. So it seems plausible that training the autoencoder could become very expensive, potentially even more expensive than the original model. We remain optimistic, however, and there is a silver lining – it increasingly seems like a large chunk of the mechanistic interpretability agenda will now turn on succeeding at a difficult engineering and scaling problem, which frontier AI labs have significant expertise in.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, in order to even begin to interpret an AI like GPT-4 (or Anthropic’s equivalent, Claude), you would need an interpreter-AI around the same size. But training an AI that size takes a giant company and hundreds of millions (soon billions) of dollars. </p><p><em>Second</em><span>, scaling the interpretation. Suppose we find all the simulated neurons for God and Godzilla and everything else, and have a giant map of exactly how they connect, and hang that map in our room. Now we want to answer questions like:</span></p><ul><li><p>If you ask the AI a controversial question, how does it decide how to respond?</p></li><li><p>Is the AI using racial stereotypes in forming judgments of people?</p></li><li><p>Is the AI plotting to kill all humans?</p></li></ul><p>There will be some combination of millions of features and connections that answers these questions. In some case we can even imagine how we would begin to do it - check how active the features representing race are when we ask it to judge people, maybe. But realistically, when we’re working with very complex interactions between millions of neurons we’ll have to automate the process, some larger scale version of “ask GPT-4 to tell us what GPT-2 is doing”. </p><p><span>This probably works for racial stereotypes. It’s more complicated once you start asking about killing all humans (what if the GPT-4 equivalent is the one plotting to kill all humans, and feeds us false answers?) But maybe there’s some way to make an interpreter AI which itself is too dumb to plot, but which can interpret a more general, more intelligent, more dangerous AI. You can see more about how this could tie into more general alignment plans in </span><a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/elk-and-the-problem-of-truthful-ai" rel="">the post on the ELK problem</a><span>. I also just found </span><a href="https://www.ai-transparency.org/" rel="">this paper</a><span>, which I haven’t fully read yet but which seems like a start on engineering safety into interpretable AIs.</span></p><p>Finally, what does all of this tell us about humans?</p><p>Humans also use neural nets to reason about concepts. We have a lot of neurons, but so does GPT-4.  Our data is very sparse - there are lots of concepts (eg octopi) that come up pretty rarely in everyday life. Are our brains full of strange abstract polyhedra? Are we simulating much bigger brains?</p><p><span>This field is very new, but I was able to find one paper, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11431" rel="">Identifying Interpretable Visual Features in Artificial and Biological Neural Systems</a><span>. The authors say:</span></p><blockquote><p>Through a suite of experiments and analyses, we find evidence consistent with the hypothesis that neurons in both deep image model [AIs] and the visual cortex [of the brain] encode features in superposition. That is, we find non-axis aligned directions in the neural state space that are more interpretable than individual neurons. In addition, across both biological and artificial systems, we uncover the intriguing phenomenon of what we call feature synergy - sparse combinations in activation space that yield more interpretable features than the constituent parts. Our work pushes in the direction of automated interpretability research for CNNs, in line with recent efforts for language models. Simultaneously, it provides a new framework for analyzing neural coding properties in biological systems.</p></blockquote><p><span>This is a single non-peer-reviewed paper announcing a surprising claim in a hype-filled field. That means it </span><em>has</em><span> to be true - otherwise it would be unfair!</span></p><p>If this topic interests you, you might want to read the full papers, which are much more comprehensive and interesting than this post was able to capture.
