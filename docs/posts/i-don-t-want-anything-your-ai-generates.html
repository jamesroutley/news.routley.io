AI output is fundamentally derivative and exploitative (of content, labor and the environment).</p><p>I can&#39;t trust the answers it provides or the text it generates. It&#39;s not a replacement for search, it simply makes search worse.</p><p>The images it generates are, at best, a polished regression to the mean. If you want custom art, pay an artist.</p><p>I want to talk to a person, not a chatbot. The chatbot wastes time while you wait for a person that can actually help.</p><p>I don&#39;t want music recommendations from something that can&#39;t appreciate or understand music. Human recommendations will always be better.</p><p>I don&#39;t want AI mediating social interactions that it cannot and does not understand (though it may appear to). If I&#39;m weary of too much volume on any social platform or in any news feed, I&#39;ll cut back on what I&#39;m following.</p><p>If you&#39;re having AI attend a meeting for you, it probably wasn&#39;t that important. If you&#39;re having AI write your email, it probably wasn&#39;t that important. If it&#39;s screening job candidates for you, you&#39;re missing quality candidates.</p><p>I don&#39;t like the idea of it being trained on anything I&#39;ve written or created.</p><p>I&#39;ll concede that Copilot is better than traditional autocomplete, but that feels like a pretty low bar.</p><p>These tools will improve. The cost to the environment will increase, it will help companies deskill jobs and muddy public discourse. The &#34;benefits&#34; it provides to end users are, at best, dubious â€” though everyone responsible for creating it will most certainly enrich themselves.</p><p>This all portends a future I can&#39;t imagine wanting or even being interested in.</p></div></div>
