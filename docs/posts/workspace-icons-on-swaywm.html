    <p>Since switching over to Fedora as my day-to-day operating system I’ve been using and loving <a href="https://swaywm.org/">swaywm</a> as my desktop manager. As a longtime vim user, controlling my desktop environment with a plethora of keyboard shortcuts just feels right.</p>

<p>One thing I love about using sway, especially coming from macOS, is how customizable everything is. I’ve been able to tweak everything to <em>exactly</em> the way I enjoy using it- a blessing and a curse given how much of a time sink the tweaks can become.</p>

<p>I wanted to share a recent tweak I’ve added which allows me to label my sway workspaces with emoji, helping me discern what each is being used for. If you’re not a regular user of a tiling window manager, this is how the top status bar normally looks when you have a bunch of workspaces open:</p>

<p>As you can imagine it can be a bit difficult to remember what each workspace has on it. My little tweak allows you to make that same status bar look like this:</p>

<p><img width="80%" src="https://www.stevegattuso.me/static/blog-images/sway-icons-with.png"/></p>

<p>Nifty, right? The trick is a small script, attached to a keyboard shortcut, that launches <a href="https://github.com/Mange/rofi-emoji">rofi-emoji</a>. I can search for an emoji and, upon hitting enter, it updates the icon of the currently selected workspace accordingly.</p>

<p>For anybody who wants to give it a shot, you can find the script in question <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/~vesto/54e297c9445119ed3dc9a60993fe50a84481516c">here</a>. If you end up trying it and have any suggestions for improvements feel free to <a href="mailto:steve@stevegattuso.me">send me an email</a>. I’d love to hear if others’ are having fun with this!</p>
