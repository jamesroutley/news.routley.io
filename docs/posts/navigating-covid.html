<h4>2022-09-29</h4>

<p>For quite a few months now, it&#39;s seemed the world has &#34;moved on&#34; from covid. The remaining mask mandates are slowly lifting, travel is becoming less restricted, etc. And during these months, I&#39;ve mostly moved on too. I&#39;ve gone out to eat at restaurants frequently, had friends over, and — with the exception of masking on trains — generally behaved as if covid wasn&#39;t an issue.</p>
<p>Part of my logic was the following: If we are no longer waiting for a better vaccine, and covid has gotten much much more contagious, how are we going to avoid it? Might as well accept it and enjoy life.</p>
<p>I think I needed that in the moment. Society felt very fragmented; people felt distant. I&#39;m glad to have rekindled some friendships and to have seen a few more faces!</p>
<p>But my logic wasn&#39;t particularly sound. I didn&#39;t think about the cumulative chance of me developing long covid: it increases with each exposure. This seem true regardless of vaccination status or age.</p>
<p>Now of course I don&#39;t want to isolate forever! Nor do I want to mask all the time. I am glad to live in a society where I can see people&#39;s faces and they can see mine. It feels more human.</p>
<p>But I will try to <em>cut down</em> my risk over the long term. I&#39;ll pay attention to when covid cases are high and maybe skip any movie theaters or restaurants when they are. I&#39;ll wear a mask in crowds and in poorly ventilated, somewhat populated rooms. If I can cut down my covid exposure by 50% over the next decade, I can reduce my chance of getting long covid by a seemingly equal proportion ...right? That seems worth it, for me.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to make any claim on how <em>you</em> should live or that there is one right way of doing things. There is no such thing. I&#39;m hoping to practice writing and publishing justification for my beliefs, and if this can be helpful to someone, all the better for it!</p>
<p>Here&#39;s to life in 2023 and beyond!</p>
