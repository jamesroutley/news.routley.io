They transform both speaker and hearer; they feed energy back and forth and amplify it. They feed understanding or emotion back and forth and amplify it,” Ursula K. Le Guin wrote in her exquisite manifesto for <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/10/21/telling-is-listening-ursula-k-le-guin-communication/">the magic of real human conversation</a>. Each word is a portable cathedral in which we clarify and sanctify our experience, a reliquary and a laboratory, holding the history of our search for meaning and the pliancy of the possible future, of there being richer and deeper dimensions of experience than those we name in our surface impressions. In the roots of words we find a portal to the mycelial web of invisible connections undergirding our emotional lives — the way “sadness” shares a Latin root with “sated” and originally meant a fulness of experience, the way “holy” shares a Latin root with “whole” and has its Indo-European origins in the notion of the interleaving of all things.</p>
<p>Because we know their power, we ask of words to hold what we cannot hold — the complexity of experience, the polyphony of voices inside us narrating that experience, the longing for clarity amid the confusion. There is, therefore, singular disorientation to those moments when they fail us — when these prefabricated containers of language turn out too small to contain emotions at once overwhelmingly expansive and acutely specific.</p>

<p>John Koenig offers a remedy for this lack in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Obscure-Sorrows-John-Koenig/dp/1501153641/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</em></strong></a> (<a href="https://search.worldcat.org/title/1285131339" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>public library</em></a>) — a soulful invitation to “get to work redefining the world around us, until our language more closely matches the reality we experience.”</p>
<p>The title, though beautiful, is misleading — the emotional states Koenig defines are not obscure but, despite their specificity, profoundly relatable and universal; they are not sorrows but emissaries of <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/06/05/susan-cain-bittersweet/">the bittersweet</a>, with all its capacity for affirming the joy of being alive: <em>maru mori</em> (“the heartbreaking simplicity of ordinary things”), <em>apolytus</em> (“the moment you realize you are changing as a person, finally outgrowing your old problems like a reptile shedding its skin”), <em>the wends</em> (“the frustration that you’re not enjoying an experience as much as you should… as if your heart had been inadvertently demagnetized by a surge of expectations”), <em>anoscetia</em> (“the anxiety of not knowing ‘the real you&#39;”), <em>dès vu</em> (“the awareness that this moment will become a memory”).</p>
<p>Koenig composites his imaginative etymologies from a multitude of sources: names and places from folklore and pop culture, terms from chemistry and astronomy, the existing lexicon of languages living and dead, from Latin and Ancient Greek to Japanese and Māori. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>In language, all things are possible. Which means that no emotion is untranslatable. No sorrow is too obscure to define. We just have to do it.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>Despite what dictionaries would have us believe, this world is still mostly undefined.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are various words addressing the maddening uncertainty of the two fundamental dimensions of human life: time and love.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>ÉNOUEMENT</strong></p>
<p>French <em>énouer</em>, to pluck defective bits from a stretch of cloth + <em>dénouement</em>, the final part of a story, in which all the threads of the plot are drawn together and everything is explained. Pronounced “ey-noo-mahn.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>QUERINOUS</strong></p>
<p>Mandarin 确认 (<em>quèrèn</em>), confirmation. Twenty thousand days is roughly fifty-five years. Pronounced “kweh-ruh-nuhs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are words that reckon with the challenges of self-knowledge.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>AGNOSTHESIA</strong></p>
<p>Ancient Greek ἄγνωστος (<em>ágnōstos</em>), not knowing + διάθεσις (<em>diáthesis</em>), condition, mood. Pronounced “ag-nos-thee-zhuh.”</p>

<p>There are words that anchor us in both the smallness and the grandeur of existence, its fierce fragility, its devastating beauty; words tasked with holding the hardest truth — that we are children of chance, born of a billion bright improbabilities that prevailed over the <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2021/07/25/richard-dawkins-death/">infinitely greater odds of nonexistence</a>, living with only marginal and mostly illusory control over the circumstances of our lives and other people’s choices, forever vulnerable to the accidents of a universe insentient to our hopes. </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>GALAGOG</strong></p>
<p>From galaxy, a gravitationally bound system of millions of stars + agog, awestruck. Pronounced “gal-uh-gawg.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>CRAXIS</strong></p>
<p>Latin <em>crāstinō diē</em>, tomorrow + <em>praxis</em>, the process of turning theory into reality. Pronounced “krak-sis.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>SUERZA</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>MAHPIOHANZIA</strong></p>

<p>Emerging from the various entries is a reminder, both haunting and comforting, that despite how singular our experience feels, we are all grappling with just about the same core concerns; that our time is short and precious; that all of our confusions are a single question, the best answer to which is love. </p>
