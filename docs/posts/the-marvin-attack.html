    <h1>The Marvin Attack</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

         <p>The Marvin Attack is a return of a 25 year old vulnerability that
         allows performing RSA decryption and signing operations as an attacker
         with the ability to observe only the time of the decryption operation
         performed with the private key.
         </p>

         <p>In 1998, Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered that the error
         messages given by SSL servers for errors in the PKCS #1 v1.5
         padding allowed an adaptive-chosen ciphertext attack; this attack
         fully breaks the confidentiality of TLS when used with RSA
         encryption.
         <a href="https://robotattack.org/">In 2018</a>,
         Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky, and Craig Young have
         shown 19 years later that many internet servers were still vulnerable
         to slight variations of the original attack.
         </p>

         <p>We show that many implementations previously thought
         immune, are vulnerable to the timing variant of the same attack.
         </p>

         <p>While the main venue of attack are TLS servers, the core issues
         that caused its wide spread are applicable to most
         asymmetric cryptographic algorithms (Diffie-Hellman, ECDSA, etc.),
         not just to RSA. Lessons learned are also applicable to testing
         the majority of cryptographic algorithms that can be vulnerable to
         side-channel attacks, not just public key cryptography.
         </p>

        <h3>What can the attackers gain?</h3>

        <p>For a vulnerable implementation the attacker is able to decrypt
        RSA ciphertexts and forge signatures.</p>

        <p>For a TLS server that defaults to RSA encryption key exchanges, that
        means the attacker can record a session and decrypt it later.</p>

        <p>For TLS hosts that use forward secure ciphersuites, the attacker
        would have to perform a massively parallel attack to forge a server
        signature before a client would time out during the connection attempt.
        That makes the attack hard, but not impossible.
        </p>

        <p>The attack is also applicable to other interfaces that perform
        RSA decryption in automated manner but don&#39;t provide the attacker
        ability to perform
        arbitrary operations with the private key. Examples include
        S/MIME, JSON web tokens, or hardware tokens (HSMs, smartcards, etc.).
        </p>

        <h3>Who is affected?</h3>

        <p>We have identified the vulnerability in multiple implementations
        and confirmed fixes in few of them,
        but belive that most of cryptographic implementations are vulnerable
        in practice.</p>

        <a id="patches"></a>

        <p>We also found few APIs that are handling errors or numbers in a way
        that will be vulnerable to timing attacks.</p>

        <a id="bad-API"></a>

        <ol><small>
            <li>The API may be secure only if the returned data is used with a KDF that is fed also random, outside attacker&#39;s control, data, like in TLS</li>
        </small></ol>

        <p>Finally, so far we have verified just one implementation that
        was not vulnerable
        when tested in a particular environment:</p>

        <a id="tested-negative"></a><table>
            <tbody><tr><td>BoringSSL (<a href="https://github.com/google/boringssl/commit/be84aeed7">6 Sep 2023</a>, TLS)</td><td>Intel i9-12900KS @5.225GHz, x86_64, Friedman test negative (p-value=0.074, n=17.3M, k=36), 95% confidence interval for 45% trimmed mean of pairwise differences: ±574ps.</td></tr>
            <tr><td><a href="https://crates.io/crates/rustls" <="" a="">rustls</a> 0.21.9 (TLS)</td><td>no support for TLS_RSA_* ciphersuites (inherently not vulnerable)</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>

        <p>Implementations not listed above have either not been tested
        or have been verified as vulnerable, but the issues are embargoed.
        We will continue updating the lists as we learn of new vulnerabilites
        or once embargoes are lifted.</p>

        <p>We have provided tools to detect the issue both on TLS server
        level and help with testing on API level.</p>

        <a name="mitigation"></a><h3>What should I do?</h3>

        <p>If you use one of the affected implementations, you should install
        the relevant updates. However we are reiterating the previous
        recommendations:</p>

        <h4>Stop using RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 encryption!</h4>

        <p>On the TLS level, only servers that enable RSA encryption are
        affected. Most modern clients support the use of Elliptic Curve Diffie
        Hellman, thus disabling ciphersuites that use RSA encryption is
        the recommended way to fix this vulnerability.</p>

        <p>Older clients will be able to use Finite Field Diffie Hellman,
        which will be secure as long as server uses fresh DHE key shares
        for every connection (protection against the Racoon attack) and
        well known parameters (or safe primes in general) for the general
        protection against cryptologic attacks. Both of those things
        are trivial to check for and verify compared to testing, let alone
        fixing, the issues in the RSA key exchange.
        </p>

        <h4>I depend on this legacy mode</h4>

        <p>While cryptographic protocols and formats allow, and have defaulted
        to use of the
        PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, they either don&#39;t need it any more for
        interoperability (like TLS), or have been updated to support
        RSA-OAEP (S/MIME, JWT, etc.). If your software or hardware doesn&#39;t
        allow use of RSA-OAEP, pressure the vendor to fix it.</p>

        <h4>I&#39;m a developer of a cryptographic library</h4>

        <p>Our recommendation is similar: deprecate and disable support for
        PKCS#1 v1.5 padding for encryption. While we do provide a way to
        handle errors in a way that should be compatible with any API
        and not leak the information relevant to the Bleichenbacher attack
        to the calling application <b>we recommend against its use</b>.
        </p>

        <p>We have had 25 years of people trying to patch this fundamentally
        broken padding mode. ROBOT have shown that the far easier workaround
        was implemented incorrectly by a large number of implementations.
        Implementing the
        Marvin workaround <i>correctly</i> is much more tricky, as it must
        include actually testing it for side channel leakage.</p>

        <p>While we focus on PKCS#1 v1.5, the vulnerability is not limited
        to just that mode, any RSA padding mode can be attacked if blinding is
        not implemented using side-channel free code, or conversion from
        numerical representation to a byte-string is not made using
        side-channel free code. You should verify that the deblinding
        operation and conversion to byte-string is side-channel free also
        with RSA-OAEP and RSASVE interfaces. Only when you&#39;re able to
        confidently verify that they are side-channel free, we would suggest
        looking into making PKCS#1 v1.5 side-channel free.</p>

        <p>Finally, we don&#39;t believe that this is limited to RSA itself,
        any implementation that uses general purpose integer implementation
        (like the default mode of OpenSSL&#39;s BIGNUM, NSS&#39;s MPI,
        Java&#39;s BigInteger, Python&#39;s <tt>int</tt>, Rust&#39;s <tt>apint</tt>,
        Gnu MP&#39;s <tt>mpz_t</tt>, Go&#39;s <tt>math/big Int</tt>,
        etc.) will suffer from the same issues. Given that there are attacks
        that exploit high order bits being zero in other algorithms, like
        <a href="https://minerva.crocs.fi.muni.cz/">Minerva</a> against
        ECDSA and <a href="https://raccoon-attack.com/">Racoon attack</a>
        against FFDH (attack against ECDH works fundamentally the same way,
        it just requires higher precision of the timing side-channel),
        any cryptographic implementation that depends on general purpose
        integer arithmetic library will be similarly vulnerable.
        See the <tt>mpn</tt> interface of GNU MP for an example of an
        <a href="https://gmplib.org/manual/Low_002dlevel-Functions#Low_002dlevel-functions-for-cryptography">
        interface well suited for side-channel free programming</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I test for it?</h3>

        <p>We have released a
        <a href="https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/blob/master/scripts/test-bleichenbacher-timing-pregenerate.py">script</a>
        for testing TLS servers as well as
        <a href="https://tlsfuzzer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/timing-analysis.html">instructions</a>
        on how to execute it.
        It&#39;s very reliable (i.e. if it reports a vulnerability, there&#39;s
        by default a 1 in 100 thousand chance that it&#39;s a false positive)
        unless it&#39;s executed with <tt>--static-enc</tt> option, or executed
        against a server that implements a Marvin workaround.
        </p>

        <p>In case the server implements the Marvin workaround
        (implicit rejection), you can
        verify that that code is implemented correctly using either the
        TLS based <a href="https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/blob/master/scripts/test-bleichenbacher-timing-marvin.py">test script</a>,
        or, in case you&#39;re testing the API directly,
        <a href="https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/tlsfuzzer/blob/master/scripts/marvin-ciphertext-generator.py">a script to generate decryption inputs</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Upon execution the script reports the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value"><i>p</i>-value</a>
        of sign tests
        and Friedman test. If they&#39;re consistently small or very small (smaller
        than 10<sup>-9</sup>) then it&#39;s extremely likely that the tested
        implementation is vulnerable.</p>

        <p>For testing APIs, we&#39;ve also prepared few scripts to make testing
        them easier in the
        <a href="https://github.com/tomato42/marvin-toolkit">marvin-toolkit</a>
        repo.</p>

        <p>Please note that to <i>exclude</i> the possibility of a side channel
        the test needs to report a 95% confidence interval for bootstrapped
        differences of around a nanosecond and the statistical tests need
        to still be negative (have <i>p</i>-values larger than
        10<sup>-5</sup>). In practice that means collecting a data set
        of at least few million connections.</p>

        <h3>How do I fix it?</h3>
        <p>While we can&#39;t give general instructions, as any fixes depend on
        where the leak happens and how the code is implemented, we wrote
        a separate article about debugging the code with the use
        of the tlsfuzzer tooling in the
        <a href="https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2023/09/29/debugging-timing-side-channel-leaks/">

        <h4><a name="faq-name"></a>Where does the Marvin name comes from?</h4>

        <p>The previous comprehensive attack against RSA was called ROBOT.
        Given the
        complexity and fragility of required fixes we don&#39;t believe that this
        attack will generally go away. Thus we named it after an android
        that lasted till the end of the universe in
        <i>The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy</i>.</p>

        <h4><a name="faq-details"></a>What are the technical details?</h4>

        <p>For the complete details, see
        our <a href="https://people.redhat.com/~hkario/marvin/marvin-attack-paper.pdf">full technical
        paper</a>.</p>

        <p>In technical terms, the Marvin Attack is not new, both
        vulnerabilities
        to timing side-channels and vulnerability of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padding
        in general were known already in the 1990&#39;s.
        The main contribution we bring is related to how to test for side
        channel timing leakage in a way that provides high accuracy,
        high precision (if provided with large data set), and thus very low
        false positive rate.
        Additionally, because we measure the whole end-to-end operation,
        by performing a complete TLS handshake,
        we&#39;re able to find issues in places other than the low level numerical
        calls (e.g. the GnuTLS vulnerability was in code that was making a
        decision about what kind of error message to print if debugging
        mode was enabled) and able to test different implementations
        relatively easily and quickly.
        </p>

        <p>In other words, we got results because we were thorough, not
        because we used novel techniques.</p>

        <h4><a name="faq-cve"></a>Is there a CVE for the Marvin Attack?</h4>

        <p>No. While it is a fundamental flaw in the RSA decryption, it
        has been widely known that padding errors need to be handled in
        constant time. But because of the complexity of implementing it in
        practice, every implementation will likely have a slightly different
        bug in the code.</p>

        <h4><a name="faq-practical"></a>How easy is it to carry out the attack? Is it practical?</h4>

        <p>Yes. We’ve been able to execute the attack against M2Crypto and
        pyca/cryptography in just a couple of hours in a normal environment
        on a mid-range laptop.
        Estimating the practically of attacks on TLS servers is more complex as
        it critically depends on the key sizes used, CPU model of the victim,
        hardware and OS configuration, the RSA implementation in question, and
        how closely to the server can the attacker
        co-locate the probe measuring the response times.
        For an attacker that can get access to a host connected to the
        same network switch as the victim, a worst case scenario (for the
        victim) would
        require a few days to perform the attack against a vulnerable version
        of OpenSSL and couple of hours to attack NSS.</p>

        <h4><a name="faq-small"></a>The test script reports a very small side-channel, does it mean I&#39;m not vulnerable in practice?</h4>

        <p>No. While previously the general consensus was that very small
        side channels, on the order of a few hundred nanoseconds, were not
        considered to be exploitable, that was based on flawed testing.
        </p>

        <p>All statistical tests make some assumptions about tested data.
        The most common assumption is that the compared samples are
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_and_identically_distributed_random_variables">Independent and Identically Distributed</a> (IID).
        That assumption is also central to the Box Test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov
        test and Mann-Whitney U test.
        In practice, we haven&#39;t found that the timing data was independent,
        in fact, for many tests of independence, just a few hundred
        observations were sufficient to absolutely exclude that possibility.
        For context, to get precise measurements we commonly need thousands to
        millions of measurements, so the lack of independence will affect
        large samples only more.</p>

        <p>Since the requirements of the test were not met, it gave incorrect
        results and thus incorrect
        conclusions from it were drawn.</p>

        <p>In our approach to testing, we use
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paired_difference_test">
        paired difference tests</a> which require idependence of the
        <i>differences</i> within pairs of measurements, not measurements
        themselves. That property is much easier to achieve if we have
        complete control over the executed test (in which order the individual
        connections are executed), and is met for the collected data.
        </p>

        <p>By using this kind of tests (sign test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
        bootstrapping of the median of paired differences, etc.) we were able
        to both show no false positives for very large samples in practice
        (hundreds of millions of observations) and the ability to detect very
        small
        differences in timing, in the order of a few CPU clock cycles, even
        when measuring across a production network, a few kilometers away,
        and 6 router hops between
        victim and attacker.</p>

        <p>In other words, the size of the side channel affects only <b>how
        many</b> observations will the attacker need to perform, <b>not if</b>
        they will be able to measure the difference at all.</p>

        <p>Also, because the paired difference tests require consistent
        environment only within each pair, parallelization of the attack
        is trivial.</p>

        <h4><a name="faq-exploited"></a>Is the vulnerability currently being exploited by attackers?</h4>

        <p>While we have no reason to believe that the Marvin Atttack has been
        exploited
        in the wild prior to this disclosure, the original ROBOT attack did
        suggest that timing variants of the vulnerability may also be possible.
        Since the details of the
        vulnerability are now public, attackers may start exploiting
        it at any time, and we recommend taking the
        countermeasures <a href="#mitigation">explained above</a> as
        soon as possible.</p>

        <h4><a name="faq-whycare"></a>RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 has been known to be insecure for 25 years. What’s the big deal?</h4>

        <p>Indeed, while problems with RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 padding have been
        known for over 25 years, and just as long we had alternatives
        in form of RSA-OAEP, protocol and format designers valued backwards
        compatibility over inheritent security of better options.
        While protocols like S/MIME (a.k.a CMS) also date from that era,
        protocols like JSON Web Tokens have been concieved well after
        RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 was known to be hard to implement correctly, yet
        included it anyway. We need to go to standards as new as WebCrypto
        to find standards that omit this bad padding completely.
        </p>

        <p>The other is complacency of implementers and protocol designers
        in considering that there are side channels that are &#34;too small to be
        detectable&#34;. Best illustrated by subsequent versions of TLS, that
        included more and more complex workarounds for the attacks against
        ciphersuites with CBC padding and RSA key exchange, only to finally
        remove them completely in TLS 1.3.
        </p>

        <h4><a name="faq-oaep"></a>I don&#39;t use RSA with PKCS#1 v1.5 padding, only OAEP, does that mean I&#39;m safe?</h4>

        <p>No. At least, not universally. Both OpenSSL and NSS bugs were in
        the numerical library, not in the padding or error reporting code.
        That code is shared between all padding modes, be it PKCS#1 v1.5, OAEP,
        or RSASVE. As such, any decryption operation will leak the same kind
        of information, and thus can be used to attack messages encrypted
        with any padding method.</p>

        <p>Only RSA-OAEP implementations that use constant-time mathematical
        library (specifically, constant-time code for deblinding and
        converstion of the large precision integer to a byte string),
        and ignore the value of the first byte of padding will not
        be vulnerable to the Marvin attack.</p>

        <h4><a name="faq-privatekey"></a>Does the Marvin Attack allow an attacker to steal the server’s private key?</h4>

        <p>No. The Marvin Attacks allows an attacker to decrypt one ciphertext
        (connection) or sign a message at a
        time. The attacker does not learn the server’s private
        key.</p>

        <h4><a name="faq-mitm"></a>Can the Marvin Attack be also used to perform MitM attacks?</h4>

        <p>Yes, but not easily. If the server supports RSA key exchange
        and is vulnerable to the Marvin Attack
        it&#39;s possible to forge a signature on an arbitrary message,
        including a ServerKeyExchange in TLS 1.2 or CertificateVerify in
        TLS 1.3. The difficulty is that both of those signatures include
        a random value selected by a client. Thus the signature needs to be
        forged before the connection times out on the client side. In practice
        that means that the attacker will need to attack multiple servers
        at once, all of which will need to provide quite clear timing signal.
        </p>

        <h4><a name="faq-cert"></a>Do I need to get a new certificate for my server?</h4>

        <p>Probably not. As the attacker does not learn the server’s
        private key, there’s no need to obtain new certificates.
        While continued use of the same key is necessary for the attacker
        to be able to decrypt previous sessions, if the server doesn&#39;t
        enable RSA encryption ciphersuites the attack is impossible
        either way.
        </p>

        <h4><a name="faq-update"></a>Do I need to update my browser?</h4>

        <p>No.  There is nothing practical that web browsers or other
        client software can do to prevent the Marvin Attack on TLS servers.
        While WebCrypto does specify RSA-OEAP decryption operation that
        may be vulnerable, there are no known fixes that address that.
        </p>

        <h4><a name="faq-detect"></a>Can I detect if someone has exploited this against me?</h4>

        <p>Possibly. If you run a server and can be certain no one
        made a large number of connections that attempted RSA key exchange
        to any of your
        servers (for example, by examining IDS or server logs), then
        you weren’t attacked.  Your logs may contain a small number of
        RSA key exchange connections from the Internet-wide scans or
        very old clients. In best case scenario an attack requires
        tens of thousands of connections per decryption.</p>

        <h4><a name="faq-fips"></a>My cryptographic module is FIPS certified, do I still have to take action?</h4>

        <p>Yes. FIPS certification for cryptographic modules doesn&#39;t require
        robust testing of side-channel protections.
        Only on Level 4 certification are <i>protections</i> against
        side-channel attacks mandatory.
        </p>

        <h4><a name="faq-ssllabs"></a>SSLLabs says I have RSA disabled. That means I’m safe,
        right?</h4>

        <p>Unfortunately, no. Although <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSLLabs</a>
        provides an invaluable suite of security tests, right now it
        only checks whether your HTTPS server directly allows RSA key exchange.
        You’re just as much at risk if your site’s certificate or key
        is used anywhere else on a server that does support RSA.
        Common examples include SMTP, IMAP, and POP mail servers, and
        secondary HTTPS servers used for specific web
        applications.</p>

        <h4><a name="faq-code"></a>Are you planning to release the code for your
        implementation of the attack?</h4>

        <p>Sort of... while we have already released the tlsfuzzer scripts
        to check if a server is vulnerable or not (i.e. tool to run a single
        oracle call), and a toolkit to make testing APIs easier,
        we do not plan to release a complete attack script.
        </p>

        <h4><a name="faq-factors"></a>What factors contributed to the Marvin Attack?</h4>

        <p>Testing for constant-timeness is <i>hard</i>.
        While there exists a
        <a href="https://neuromancer.sk/article/26">multitude of tools</a>
        to do that, their usability is not conducive to them
        being used by
        <a href="https://crocs.fi.muni.cz/_media/publications/pdf/2022-sp-jancar.pdf">developers</a>
        or <a href="https://neuromancer.sk/article/29">researchers</a>.</p>

        <p>Any tool that requires code annotations to work is also
        subject to user error.</p>

        <p>The other factor is the disregard of small side-channels,
        for example, in TLS 1.2 specification we read:
        </p><blockquote>This leaves a small timing channel, since MAC
         performance depends to some extent on the size of the data fragment,
         but it is not believed to be large enough to be exploitable, due to
         the large block size of existing MACs and the small size of the
         timing signal.</blockquote><small>
         <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5246#page-24">RFC5246</a></small>

        <h4><a name="faq-time"></a>Why did this research take so long?</h4>

        <p>While indeed the first CVEs were assigned in 2020, the last major
        fixes were performed in 2023. This was caused by two problems:
        first is that we were struggling with false positives caused by
        the timing signal generated by the <i>harness</i> (test script),
        and that caused the other issue. Because of unreliable results
        it was hard to pinpoint the particular cause for the timing signal
        and without that, it was hard to convince upstream developers to
        work on the issue. Only when we created a constant-time test
        harness were we able to move forward with fixes (and that happened
        in the middle of 2022).
        </p>

        <h4><a name="faq-example"></a>I&#39;d like to learn about side-channel attacks, do you have some example code for that?</h4>

        <p>Yes. If you&#39;d like to see if side-channel attacks are easy
        to perform against particularly vulnerable services, or
        how introduction of a network between the attacker and the
        victim impacts the statistical tests, or even try to implement
        simple password comparison using side-channel free code,
        we have published a blog post with relevant resources:
        <a href="https://securitypitfalls.wordpress.com/2023/10/16/experiment-with-side-channel-attacks-yourself/">
        Experiment with side-channel attacks yourself!</a></p>

        <h4><a name="faq-previous"></a>How is this related to previous research?</h4>

        <p>First practical timing attacks against DH, RSA, and DSA were presented
        <a href="https://paulkocher.com/doc/TimingAttacks.pdf">by Paul Kocher in 1996.</a>.</p>

        <p>Originally this type of attack was
        <a href="http://archiv.infsec.ethz.ch/education/fs08/secsem/bleichenbacher98.pdf">discovered by Daniel Bleichenbacher in 1998</a>.</p>

        <p>Klima, Pokorny and Rosa
        <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2003/052">improved the attack and discovered the bad-version oracle in 2003</a>.</p>

        <p>In 2012 Romain Bardou and others <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/417">developed a much more efficient Bleichenbacher attack algorithm</a>
        that reduces the number of needed connections.</p>

        <p>In 2014
        <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity14/technical-sessions/presentation/meyer">Christopher Meyer and others discovered Bleichenbacher vulnerabilities in JSSE and other products</a>
        and describe the first practical timing attacks.</p>

        <p>Tibor Jager and colleagues discovered that
        <a href="https://www.nds.rub.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2015/08/21/Tls13QuicAttacks.pdf">it is possible to use a cross-protocol Bleichenbacher attack against TLS 1.3 and QUIC</a>.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://drownattack.com/">DROWN attack</a> is a protocol
        level Bleichenbacher vulnerability in SSL version 2. The DROWN research
        also contains further insights on cross-protocol scenarios.</p>

        <p>In 2018, Hanno Böck, Juraj Somorovsky, and Craig Young
        <a href="https://robotattack.org/">did show that a lot of HTTPS
        hosts are still vulnerable against a slight variation of the original
        Bleichenbacher attack</a>.</p>

        <p>In 2019, Eyal Ronen and others have
        <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8835216">shown that a
        lot of cryptographic libraries can be attacked using cache timing
        attacks</a>.</p>
