<p>Given the integral role of computers in my daily life, perfecting my relationship with my keyboard has been something I’ve always been fascinated with. More specifically, the ubiquitous usage of <span>QWERTY</span> despite its known inefficiencies. Approximately a year ago, the Colemak layout caught my attention, promising increased typing efficiency and reduced finger movement.</p>
<p>The Switch to Colemak:</p>
<p>Intrigued by the claims of reduced muscle fatigue with Colemak, I decided to make the switch. Some interesting tidbits from the transition:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>OSX</span> has built-in Colemak support, but Windows does not.</li>
<li>You can use <span>AHK</span> or other portable programs to use Colemak without requiring administrative access. This is helpful if you’re using a<span></span> <span>‘</span>locked-down’ computer but still quite annoying because I would have to carry a small <span>USB</span> key for every computer that I used or redownload the programs.</li>
<li>Speed was terrible and painful at the onset. I initially started out at 10 <span>WPM</span>. I used keybr.com pretty much exclusively to train with their typing program, tests, and challenging others. You can use other sites, but I noticed that my <span>WPM</span> varied between different sites.</li>
<li>It took about 5 months before I was able to reach around 86 <span>WPM</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Return to <span>QWERTY</span>:</p>
<p>Colemak was great for one thing: comfort. It was amazing to type without your fingers having to do any significant movement. They could just rest on the middle row and you’d occasionally have to move a row up or down. There were a few problems, though.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Speed - I knew that I could easily type at 90-100 <span>WPM</span> before the switch, but I seemed to stagnate in the mid 80’s.</li>
<li>Compatibility - Because I use multiple different computers and occasionally other people’s computer, I found it more and more annoying that Colemak support was not built into Windows computers and the fact that I had to carry around a <span>USB</span> just to type.</li>
<li>Vim bindings - As a heavy Vim user, my muscle memory went haywire with the switch.</li>
</ol>
<p>After six months of using Colemak, I decided to switch back to <span>QWERTY</span>. To my dismay, my typing speed drastically plummeted to a mere 10 <span>WPM</span> initially but now its back higher than it was before.</p>

<p>Lessons Learned:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Switching keyboard layouts requires substantial time and effort.</p></li>
<li><p>Before making a significant change, assess how the switch may affect your workflow.</p></li>
<li><p>Colemak is pretty awesome if your goal isn’t to be the fastest typer. I really think it should be the default keyboard layout taught.</p></li>
</ol>
