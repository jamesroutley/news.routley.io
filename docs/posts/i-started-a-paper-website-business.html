          <p> <i>December 14th 2021</i> </p><p> TLDR; I started a business that lets you <a href="https://paperwebsite.com/" target="_blank">build websites using pen &amp; paper</a>. In the process I went viral on Twitter, made $1,000 in two days, and blew $720 on 100 paper notebooks from Alibaba. </p><h3>📖 Can you build a website from a piece of paper?</h3><p> One day, a riddle popped into my brain: </p><p> <i>&#34;Can you build a website from a piece of paper?&#34;</i> </p><p> I&#39;m a man who <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/projects/mailoji" target="_blank">once bought 300 emoji domain names from Kazakhstan,</a> but, even to me, the idea of building a website from a piece of paper seemed a <i>bit</i> strange. </p><p> Around this time though, I&#39;d been planning to start a brand new daily blog. </p><p> I began picturing myself in a dressing gown, with a cup of tea and a biro, somehow writing this online blog from a page in a notebook. </p><p> This idea seemed <i>very</i> funny. </p><p> Can you build a website from a piece of paper? I decided to at least try it. </p><h3>🧙‍♂️ Paper website experiment #1</h3><p> Feeling confident, I got out some paper and wrote down a chorus from <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</i> (don&#39;t ask). </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639142559083.png?alt=media&amp;token=6e3c2fd2-21d1-449e-9cda-65ea04c17a95" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> If I could transform these handwritten words into pixel words, then it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to convert that into the HTML code for a website. </p><p> I took a photo of the page with my phone, and eagerly fed the image into some software that could recognise handwriting. </p><p> A few moments later, I had the results. </p><h3>😱 These results may shock you</h3><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639142567580.png?alt=media&amp;token=15fd8e80-676d-47c3-91eb-b31c0e28b414" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> There were a lot of mistakes. </p><p> Despite being left-handed and smudging every birthday card I&#39;ve ever written in, my handwriting is quite neat, so a paper website was not looking promising. </p><p> The software kind of understood my words, so I wondered if I could just fix the spelling mistakes somehow. </p><p> All I needed was a really good spellchecker. </p><h3>🤖 A really good spellchecker</h3><p> GPT-3 has been hailed a breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence. </p><p> Billions of parameters work together like a human brain. It can generate whole books, brand new ideas, and chat like a human. </p><p> I needed it for one thing, and one thing only: to be a glorified spellchecker. </p><p> My idea was to feed this world-class AI sentences with spelling mistakes, and examples of how they should be corrected. </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639142615331.png?alt=media&amp;token=38f149ec-1e68-4727-bc29-4857b5734c40" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> With some luck, it should then learn how to fix mistakes on all future sentences for my paper website. </p><h3>🧪 Paper website experiment #2</h3><p> I strapped GPT-3 onto my handwriting recognition code, and retried the experiment. </p><p> <b><i>&gt; Snap picture. Upload. Cross fingers.</i></b> </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639142623074.png?alt=media&amp;token=b12523d8-7482-4d31-90f2-3016dd911c71" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> Somehow, it worked! </p><p> It didn&#39;t take too much extra effort to build a small prototype that let me upload a photo of my page, turn it into code, and host it on a tiny website. </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639475066242.png?alt=media&amp;token=e9d71744-69f0-4cc0-8190-a3786f052be1" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> I also built a basic editor that let me add links, images and headings to make the website more interesting. </p><p> Can you build a website from a piece of paper? It seemed like it. </p><p> Was it practical to use paper for a <i>real</i> website though? No idea. </p><h3>🌄 The first ever paper website</h3><p> A few days later, I set off for a week&#39;s holiday in the Peak District. Being me, I thought this would be the perfect time to build a test paper website about the trip. </p><p> On the first morning, I got up early and began writing my website on paper. </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639474586662.png?alt=media&amp;token=8b7ce2ef-dd17-424f-8adb-9de6d56ecbe9" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> My girlfriend watched me, puzzled. After convincing her that I hadn&#39;t gone crazy, I proudly took a photo of my page, and sent her the URL of my newly created paper blog post. </p><p> Although this was the lamest mic drop of all time, I think she was impressed. </p><h3>📝 One week of paper blogging</h3><p> Every morning I kept adding to my new paper website until I had written a <a href="https://weekinthepeaks.com/" target="_blank">whole tiny travel blog</a> about the trip. </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639142676075.png?alt=media&amp;token=f290fc46-74b2-4eaa-847d-e9598dbcad91" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> Despite no one reading it, I found myself genuinely looking forward to writing a new post each morning. </p><p> I wrote more without the distractions of the internet, and it was refreshing not being in front of a screen. It was also just really fun. </p><p> This made me wonder: </p><p> If I enjoyed this way of building websites, perhaps others would too? </p><h3>💻 Starting a paper website business</h3><p> Fueled by the excitement of my paper travel blog, I decided to start a service that would let anyone build their own paper website. </p><p> Over a few weeks I fleshed out my prototype. I built an app for easily taking paper pictures, and created a payment system using Stripe for subscriptions. </p><p> The last step was choosing a name. Fortunately, <a href="https://paperwebsite.com/" target="_blank">paperwebsite.com</a> was available for £10, so I creatively called my service: <a href="https://paperwebsite.com/" target="_blank">Paper Website.</a> </p><p> Now I just needed some customers. </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639142687737.png?alt=media&amp;token=993b8ba7-5b97-4f17-8eff-5e935a941bc3" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3>🏷️ Marketing tips from the top</h3><p> To entice some potential customers, I decided to conjure up <i>the ultimate deal.</i> </p><p> For $99, you&#39;d get a year long paper website, and a free Moleskine notebook to build your website in. </p><p> It was everything you needed to start your own paper website (although arguably, a pen might also be useful). </p><p> I started dropping links everywhere to spread the good word. </p><h3>📈 Mysterious traffic</h3><p> One afternoon, I was sat in a cafe ready to chow down on some serious work. </p><p> I briefly opened Google Analytics, and noticed that for some reason there were 30 people on paperwebsite.com. </p><p> This was a lot more than the usual 0 website visitors. <i>Things</i> were happening. </p><p> After some investigation, I found that Paper Website had randomly been featured as a tiny footnote in a <a href="https://thehustle.co/%E2%9B%B3-golf-is-blowing-up/" target="_blank">massive newsletter.</a> </p><p> Just as I cracked the case, something amazing happened. </p><h3>🎉 First customer</h3><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639142697110.png?alt=media&amp;token=c858ea05-fa01-4326-b285-4147c7775bf4" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> I watched as Paper Website went from £0 in sales, to £7 as it got its first monthly subscription customer. </p><p> I let out a tiny fistpump in the middle of the cafe that I desperately hope no one saw. </p><p> It wasn&#39;t over yet though. Soon after, somebody was lured in by <i>the ultimate deal.</i> </p><p> I had two customers! Now my girlfriend was impressed: </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639168620794.png?alt=media&amp;token=cd5c9b0f-a841-4692-b62c-99c3895aec8c" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> I was the Dunder Mifflin of the internet. </p><h3>🚚 Notebook woes</h3><p> My new users began building their paper websites, whilst I realised I now had to ship somebody a Moleskine notebook as part of <i>the ultimate deal.</i> </p><p> I loaded up the Moleskine website and saw this was going to cost a staggering $30. </p><p> Paper Website would go bankrupt at these prices, so somehow I needed to reduce costs. </p><p> Then I wondered: could I just create my own notebooks? </p><h3>💳 Buying 100 custom notebooks</h3><p> I opened my browser and went to Alibaba.com. Ten minutes later I was talking to the <i>Jiaxing Banana Import &amp; Export Co.</i> - apparent experts in creating notebooks. </p><p> Their minimum order was 100 notebooks at $3.25 each. I could even have a custom logo on the front. </p><p> This was a point of no return. By purchasing these notebooks I was commiting to an idea that had only been validated by 2 sales. Shipping was also $395. </p><p> But hey, it would be really cool to have my own notebooks. </p><p> I clicked buy. They&#39;d arrive in 4 weeks. </p><h3>📦 Notebook Delivery</h3><p> One month later, two large brown cardboard boxes arrived on my doorstep. </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639142711973.png?alt=media&amp;token=219c9ea3-aad8-4d4d-94c5-53a6d531ad4b" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> I eagerly cracked them open to see what on earth I&#39;d purchased. </p><p> Fortunately, the <i>Jiaxing Banana Import &amp; Export Co.</i> hadn&#39;t let me down. </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639142715882.png?alt=media&amp;token=dccb1a3c-f3a1-423c-84ac-3b22e25198f6" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> 100 white notebooks, each with my logo on the front. They were the perfect operating system for my paper-based internet. </p><p> My brief, unofficial partnership with Moleskine ended, and I proudly added the new notebooks to my website. </p><h3>📆 Preparing for launch</h3><p> Now I had 100 notebooks sat in my kitchen, I needed to actually sell them, otherwise a lot of my family would be getting notebooks for Christmas. </p><p> I decided the best plan would be to generate some hype and do a big launch. </p><p> Over the next week I fine tuned my website, and created a video to try and explain to the public what on earth this paper website thing was. </p><p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/643430868?title=0&amp;byline=0" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><p> On November 10th 2021, I typed up a launch tweet. </p><p> Then, I tweeted it. </p><h3>💸 Going viral on twitter</h3><p> It couldn&#39;t have gone better. The tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/tinyprojectsdev/status/1458414762203795460" target="_blank">blew up.</a> </p><p> It quickly spread from my little following to other people on twitter, getting 230k impressions, over 1500 likes, and 300 retweets. </p><p> More importantly though, I was selling some paper websites! </p><p> Over 2 days I sold 11 subscriptions netting ~$1000/yr in revenue, a lot of them were <i>the ultimate deal</i>. </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639142721019.png?alt=media&amp;token=3b4f6e60-e8ca-4d72-94f3-a785bdb292ed" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3>🎊 Launch success</h3><p> After finishing <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/paper-website">4th on Product Hunt</a> a few days later, Paper Website was sitting at a modest ~$3,600/yr in subscriptions. </p><p> Loads of people had also now started to build their own paper websites. </p><p> There were websites about <a href="https://doughnuts.design/" target="_blank">game design</a>, <a href="https://angry-catfish-36.web.app/" target="_blank">puzzles</a>, and even <a href="https://thirasoap.com//" target="_blank">making soap</a> - all created from pen &amp; paper. It was so awesome to see. </p><p> Can you build a website from a piece of paper? People were doing it right now! </p><h3>📬 Becoming a mailman</h3><p> When the chaos died down, I bought some padded envelopes, and started packaging my notebooks into them. </p><p> Then, I opened my door, walked down the road, and posted the first ever paper website notebook to someone in London. </p><p> This was a surreal experience, when I first imagined a paper website, I never expected things to go this far. </p><p> But, here I was. This is where my story ends, standing in the middle of a random street in England, dropping a notebook into a Royal Mail postbox. </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639142726875.png?alt=media&amp;token=484ecf78-de0f-417f-9dbc-b40c8405f63f" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3>📘 The end</h3><p> The other day my dad (who&#39;s a farmer) tried out Paper Website, and created a <a href="https://red-chicken-48.web.app/" target="_blank">page</a> about building a gate out of horseshoes. </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639472924737.png?alt=media&amp;token=3126def4-25ef-4674-b30e-9733c93bcd75" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> Although I still have a big box of notebooks in my kitchen, what I&#39;m really excited about is seeing more websites like his. </p><p> There&#39;s a lot of weird, wonderful and interesting ideas out there (like horseshoe gates) that never make it to the internet. Perhaps if starting a website was as simple as picking up a pen, we might see more of them. </p><p> Unknowingly stumbling across someone&#39;s paper website also sounds like a lot of fun, and I think the internet should be more fun. </p><p> By the way, I did end up starting my new daily blog. </p><p> I&#39;m currently sat in my dressing gown, with a cup of tea and a biro, writing my latest post for it right now on a piece of paper. </p><p> It&#39;s called: <i>I blew $720 on 100 notebooks from Alibaba and started a Paper Website business.</i> </p><p> You&#39;ve been reading a paper website this whole time. </p><figure><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/paper-website.appspot.com/o/xc4sR7hXDtRiHQ9HeqbzlQ2O9Vv1%2FppRd7MWIR2a1BDbOQdwp%2FSiteImages%2F1639389131965.png?alt=media&amp;token=12be4dfa-72c5-4f7a-95c0-3b8db78bcf9e" alt=""/><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p> I make <a href="https://tinyprojects.dev/">tiny projects</a> </p>
