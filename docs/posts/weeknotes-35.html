<ul>
<li>feeling a bit more head empty than usual as I&#39;m coming off a three day headache, but i am glad to be here as ever.</li>
<li>i finished reading tiny experiments. i am not sure overall whether i recommend it overall but it was helpful for my &#34;process over goals&#34; outlook configuration lol.</li>
<li>it was my birthday this week! I hung out at the <a href="https://www.londonnightcafe.co.uk/">london night café</a> with some friends. i went to a meetup by <a href="https://future-inventions.net/">future inventions</a> about digital gardens. i went to <a href="https://www.chishuru.com/">chishuru</a> (second black woman ever and first black brit to get a michelin star!) and i rested in the sun and it was lovely! big recommend taking the week off if you can swing it with your work and/or life situation!</li>
<li>speaking of digital gardens, i think the notes blog (if you know you know) is no more and i&#39;ll no longer be linking out to it or regularly updating it. i was hoping for more conversation but it feels like social media is where you do that; especially if the only way to comment is to use your github account!</li>
<li>i also am nervous to <a href="https://buttondown.com/oluonline">post a newsletter</a> so i will think about how i can Provide Subscriber Value (caps so you know i mean it).</li>
<li>due to the tiny experiments reading i&#39;m thinking maybe i&#39;ll try and post &#34;something, anything&#34; change-wise to this blog daily? might be just too much work for myself though. posting once a week on top of weeknotes was one i promised myself before but it was too flexible and i didn&#39;t do it (or left it to the last minute and didn&#39;t enjoy what i wrote), plus i often let my drafts sit for too long and decided they were bad. much to think about!</li>
<li>trying to pitch more tech-flavoured non-fiction writing at the moment! i heard back from one thing that i&#39;m excited about and got in, so i&#39;ll tell you about that when it&#39;s out!!</li>
<li>thinking more about <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/olu.online/post/3lkyruqbm5k2t">llm assisted coding</a> over on bluesky.</li>
<li>need to pick an m word for <a href="https://olu.online/blog/?q=alphabet-superset">alphabet superset</a> and tempted to choose &#34;mentorship&#34; and chat about how help in upskilling in tech is hard to find, and that&#39;s part of the appeal of ai help. what feels more prescient at the minute is a post about spheres of social existence online but i can&#39;t think of a m word for that lol.</li>
<li>i might read more blood in the machine (the book on luddites) after this even though the last bit i read about the factory injuries was harrowing.</li>
<li>this week i ate and drank botanical, non-caffeinated energy drinks, sausage rolls, sour chewy sweets, barbecue crisps, and cheese crisps.</li>
<li>hope you had a great week, see you soon!</li>
