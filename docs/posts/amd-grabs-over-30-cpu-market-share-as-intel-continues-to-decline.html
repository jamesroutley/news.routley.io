    <h1>AMD Grabs over 30% CPU Market Share as Intel Continues to Decline</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

						
			<p>AMD has achieved a historical market share of over 30% within the overall CPU segment thanks to its EPYC CPUs. The latest share statistics were shared by Mercury Research for the fourth quarter of 2022 which highlight the progress of Intel and AMD in the processor space.</p>
<h2>AMD&#39;s EPYC Win! CPU Share Grew Past 30% In Q4 2022 As Intel Continues To Decline</h2>
<p>According to the report by Mercury Research (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/amd-wins-nearly-third-processor-market-arms-climb-slows-analyst-report-2023-02-09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Reuters</a>), it&#39;s being reported that AMD now has a market share of 31.3% (up from 28.5% in Q4 2021) versus Intel&#39;s 68.7% (down from 71.5%). That&#39;s more than a quarter of the overall market that AMD has managed to grab with its server &amp; client chips and this is just the start.</p>
<p>The research outlet also pointed out that both Intel and AMD saw the biggest shipment decline in more than 30 years. This had a major effect on the client side of chip sales where both companies reported a loss during the previous earnings (Intel / AMD). The yearly decline of CPU shipments is currently at 34% while the quarterly drop is around 19%.</p>
<blockquote><p>“For the year, 2022 unit shipments were 374 million (excluding ARM processors) and revenues were $65 billion, down 21 and 19%, respectively,” Mercury Research added. “While this appears very gloomy, note that overall processor market revenue was still higher in 2022 than any year ever with the exception of 2020 and 2021.”</p>

<p>AMD&#39;s <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-reaffirms-epyc-bergamo-cpus-in-1h-2023-instinct-mi300-apus-in-2h-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EPYC &amp; Instinct chips</a> are expected to push the company&#39;s <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-epyc-cpus-including-genoa-bergamo-expected-to-push-server-market-share-beyond-30-percent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">market share well beyond 30% </a>by the end of this year. The company really has a strong roadmap laid out in the server segment &amp; we can&#39;t wait to see how things evolve in the coming quarters. Meanwhile, other <a href="https://wccftech.com/dram-demand-to-rebound-in-mid-2023-as-intel-sapphire-rapids-xeon-cpus-likely-to-be-adopted-by-amazon-google-meta-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysts predict</a> that Intel&#39;s recent Sapphire Rapids Xeon CPUs might just be the turning tide for the blue team with large customers upgrading to the new chips which will also prove to be very positive for the DRAM space.</p>
<p>Overall, Intel still remains at the top position in the server space but they will have to make some radical changes to stop the dominating spree that AMD has managed to make over the past years with its EPYC line of CPUs. The company also has a strong client roadmap laid out which should go against Intel&#39;s own plans later this year. Both companies also introduced a strong mobility lineup &amp; that is definitely going to mark a heated battle in the laptop segment.</p>
