The addition of realtime support to Linux is a long story; it first 
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/106010/">shows up in LWN</a> in 2004.  For much of that
time, it has seemed like only a little more work was needed to get across
the finish line; thus we ran headlines like <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/345076/">the
realtime preemption endgame</a> — in 2009.  At the <a href="https://lpc.events/">2023 Linux Plumbers Conference</a>, Thomas
Gleixner informed the group that, now, the end truly is near.  There is
really only one big problem left to be solved before all of that work can
land in the mainline.
</p><p>

The point of realtime preemption is to ensure that the highest-priority
process will always be able to run with a minimum (and predictable) delay.
To that end, it makes the kernel preemptible in as many situations as
possible, with the exceptions being tightly limited in scope.  The basic
mechanics of how that works have been established for a long time, but
there have been a lot of details to resolve along the way.  The realtime
preemption work has resulted in the rewriting of much of the core kernel
over the years, with benefits that extend far beyond the realtime use case.
</p><p>
Gleixner started by noting that, while the realtime preemption project has
been underway for nearly 20 years, it is actually closer to
25 years for him — he started working on realtime support for Linux in
1999.  Once it&#39;s done, he said, there will be &#34;a big party&#34;.  Is that point
at hand?  The answer, he said, is &#34;yes — kind of&#34;.  There is one last
holdout to be dealt with: <tt>printk()</tt>.
</p><p>
Whenever code in the kernel needs to send something to the system consoles
and logs, it calls <tt>printk()</tt> or one of the numerous functions built
on top of it.  One might not think that printing a message would be a
challenging task, but it is.  A call to <tt>printk()</tt> can come from any
context, including in non-maskable-interrupt handlers or other
<tt>printk()</tt> calls.  The information being printed may be crucial,
especially in the case of a system crash, so <tt>printk()</tt> calls have
to work regardless of the context.  As a result, there are a lot of
concurrency and locking issues, and lots of driver-related complications.
</p><p>
<tt>printk()</tt>, Gleixner said, is fully synchronous in current kernels;
a call will not return until the message has been sent to all of the
configured destinations.  That is &#34;stupid&#34;; much of what is printed is
simply noise, especially during the boot process, and there is no point to
waiting for it all to go out.  Beyond being pointless, that waiting
introduces latency, which runs counter to the goals of the realtime work,
so the realtime developers have long since moved <tt>printk()</tt> output
into separate threads, making it asynchronous.  That code is a bunch of
hacks rather than a real solution, though.  A better job must be done to
make this work useful for the rest of the kernel.
</p><p>
The <tt>printk()</tt> problem has been worked on seriously since 2018,
resulting in about 300 patches that have either gone upstream or are
waiting in linux-next; this work has been <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/780556/">covered here</a> at times.  There are, he said,
three final patch sets currently in the works to finish the job.  A few
tricky details are still being worked on.  One of those is the handover
mechanism; if the kernel has an emergency message to put out (it&#39;s
crashing, for example), it may need to grab control of a console that is
currently printing a lower-priority message.  Doing that safely from any
context is not an easy thing to do.
</p><p>
Another ongoing task is marking console drivers that are not safe to use in
some contexts; if, for example, outputting a message during a non-maskable
interrupt requires doing video-mode setting, it&#39;s just not going to work.
</p><p>
Gleixner finished the prepared part of his talk by saying that, even
though it&#39;s getting close, nobody should ask him when the work will be
done.  <tt>printk()</tt> is unpredictable, and he is no longer willing to
even try.  Even so, he expressed hopes that the rest of the realtime
preemption code would be in mainline before the 20th anniversary comes late
in 2024.

An audience member asked whether there had been any interesting changes in
the <tt>printk()</tt> code over the last year; Gleixner answered that there
have been no fundamental conceptual changes.  John Ogness, who has done
much of the <tt>printk()</tt> work, said that the handover code has been
reduced somewhat, but that some work remains; there are 76 console drivers
in the kernel that need to be fixed, and it may take a while until they are
all done.  The handover code has been changed to allow drivers to be
updated one at a time rather than requiring that this work all be done at
once.  (See <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/909980/">this article</a> for more
discussion on the recent <tt>printk()</tt> work).
</p><p>
Masami Hiramatsu asked which kernel messages need to be printed
synchronously; Gleixner answered that almost everything should be made
asynchronous.  Beyond reducing latency associated with <tt>printk()</tt>
calls, asynchronous output allows the creation of a separate kernel thread for
each console, letting the faster consoles go at full speed rather than
waiting for the slowest one.  He also said that the code has been changed
to ensure that important messages are fully copied into the message buffer
before the first line is output, just in case a faulty console driver brings
the whole system down in flames.  Further safety is obtained by writing to
the known-safe consoles first.  If, for example, there is a
persistent-memory store available, messages are put there before being sent
to physical devices, once again preserving the output even if a faulty
driver kills the system.
</p><p>
As the session closed, Clark Williams asked whether, once the
<tt>printk()</tt> patches go upstream, Gleixner would try to push the rest
of the realtime code (which wasn&#39;t discussed in this session) in the same
merge window.  The answer was a qualified &#34;yes&#34;; he might try if all of the
code is staged in linux-next and seems ready to go.
