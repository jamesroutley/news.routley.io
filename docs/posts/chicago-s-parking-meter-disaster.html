    <h1>Chicago’s parking meter disaster</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In the annals of infrastructure investing,  Chicago is best known for getting fleeced in a notorious parking meter deal under ex-Mayor Richard M. Daley. We regret to report that short of declaring bankruptcy, the city is more stuck than ever with this ball-and-chain agreement for decades to come.</p><p>The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this month <a href="http://media.ca7.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/OpinionsWeb/processWebInputExternal.pl?Submit=Display&amp;Path=Y2023/D04-07/C:22-1166:J:Wood:aut:T:fnOp:N:3027710:S:0">affirmed</a> the deal with Chicago Parking Meters LLC, known as CPM, the private company that profits outrageously from Daley’s folly. The judges upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit brought by Chicago motorists who said the deal created a price-gouging monopoly that violates federal law aimed at preserving competitive markets.</p><p>The lawsuit claimed the deal left the city with no real control over on-street meters, and stymied efforts to expand public transit, create bike lanes or otherwise respond to changing times in any way that would interfere with the flow of meter money to CPM. Chicago, the suit alleged, had become a puppet of the investors, unable to act in the public interest without financial penalties that made action unaffordable and therefore impossible.</p><p>Alas, the appellate judges made mincemeat of that argument. While the deal “might have been foolish, short-sighted or worse,” the court said, perhaps employing some irony Chicago was within its rights to undertake the giveaway, and still retains enough regulatory authority to put a kibosh on the lawsuit’s monopoly claim.</p><p>So much for a creative legal effort to win back some leverage on behalf of the suckers otherwise known as Chicago’s citizens.</p><p>The deal came about in 2008, as Daley and the City Council — whose lapdog aldermen were the real puppets in this case — sought to close a budget shortfall. After due diligence so cursory as to not deserve the name, Chicago agreed to sell a 75-year lease on its parking meter system for just $1.16 billion. Within a few years, the city had spent that money, and sharply jacked up parking rates, as required in the deal. The investors, meantime, recouped their original outlay within a decade, and made millions in additional profits with much more still to come.</p><section id="gallery_div_SBGRPPKBBBHRVAIZDWOV5RYN3M"><section aria-roledescription="carousel" aria-label="Tribune cartoonist’s decadeslong critique of Chicago’s parking meter deal"><p><span>After the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the deal with Chicago Parking Meters LLC, the city is more stuck than ever with this ball-and-chain parking meter deal. </span>(Scott Stantis/For the Chicago Tribune)</p></section></section><p>The investors were fiendishly clever in guaranteeing their interests. Under the contract, the city must maintain at least 30,000 meters in any given year, according to the 7th Circuit ruling. With a few trivial exceptions, if the city cuts parking fees, reduces the number of spaces or the hours of operation, or even just fails to keep up with inflation, it is obliged to pay CPM for “lost” revenue.</p><p>After those so-called true-up payments became a political scandal in 2013, ex-Mayor Rahm Emanuel amended and reapproved the contract, further binding the city to it. As it stands, Chicago has paid more than $150 million in true-ups to CPM, according to the court’s ruling, and there’s every reason to expect it will be paying more in the future.</p><p>This is where we thought the lawsuit made a very good point. While Chicago has the authority to set parking rates and revise the number and location of meters, those powers are toothless, as the lawsuit said, because the city can’t use them freely without paying a fortune to its CPM overlords.</p><p>The court didn’t see it that way. The city has shown it still regulates its parking by, for instance, adding meters in new zones that are treated differently from those covered under the deal. “The fact that the city pays a price for certain actions cannot be enough to undermine the whole concession,” the court found. “Regulation is possible even if the city must conduct a cost-benefit analysis before it takes a given step.”</p><p>Benefits? What benefits?</p><p>Well, the original check didn’t bounce. CPM paid the $1.16 billion upfront, temporarily saving Daley and his henchmen from making budget cuts or raising taxes while enabling them, in typical Illinois fashion, to kick financial obligations down the road.</p><p>CPM also agreed to some changes in 2013 that made the deal <a href="https://www.metroplanning.org/work/project/29/subpage/3?utm_source=%2fparking&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=redirect&amp;RedirectReferrer=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.com%2f">slightly less terrible</a> for the city. Plus, it invested a substantial sum (though nowhere near its profits to date) in replacing old-fashioned coin meters with electronic ones, updating the system for mobile apps and handling payments. The system works efficiently, at least compared with those in other cities that haven’t updated their meters.</p><p>But the cost!</p><p>Way back in 2009, Chicago’s <a href="http://dig.abclocal.go.com/wls/documents/060209parkingmeter.pdf">inspector general</a> confirmed that the city had sold out for far less than the lease’s value. A report by Bloomberg Business said CPM stood to earn about <i>10 times</i> what it paid over the life of the contract. Any way you slice it financially, Chicago got taken to the cleaners.</p><div id="news_letter_div"><div><div><p><img src="https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/_j7aoDIYkhkbQAu2Gz60E2VD_qw=/84x84/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/PGWZQSUOSVFADASMRE3G2YHBKY.jpg" width="84" height="84"/></p><div><p><h3>Chicago Tribune Opinion</h3></p><p>Weekdays</p><p>Read the latest editorials and commentary curated by the Tribune Opinion team.</p></div></div></div></div><p>Worse still, the deal makes it harder for Chicago to get greener and otherwise change with the times. It commits the city to devoting vast stretches of public real estate to metered parking at the expense of initiatives that de-emphasize motor vehicles.</p><p>Closing streets for outdoor dining, street fairs and festivals becomes more costly, as does making the city friendlier to pedestrians, cyclists, public transit and ride-sharing. The deal also complicated Chicago’s pandemic response, so, yes, it’s bad for public health too.</p><p>We wish we had better news, but at least there’s this: Can we all agree that Chicago must never, never, <i>never </i>let another parking meter deal happen?</p><p>The next time an arrogant mayor tries to ram through a megabucks contract lasting damn-near forever with no real analysis, remember the parking deal!</p><p>We have a message for the CPM investors too. You were far smarter than the city of Chicago and you made a fortune. How about making some voluntary concessions or giving at least a smidgen of that moola back to the city?</p><p><i>Join the discussion on Twitter </i><a href="https://twitter.com/chitribopinions"><i>@chitribopinions</i></a><i> and on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/chitribopinion/"><i>Facebook</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><i>Submit a letter, of no more than 400 words, to the editor </i><a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/letters/chi-submit-a-letter-to-the-editor-htmlstory.html"><i>here</i></a><i> or email </i><a href="mailto:letters@chicagotribune.com"><i>letters@chicagotribune.com</i></a><i>.</i></p></article></div>
