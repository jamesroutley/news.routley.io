<dt><a href="https://github.com/punchagan/expense-tracker">Expense Tracker</a></dt>
<dd>I built a personal Expense Tracker over the month of
October using SQLite and Streamlit, because I wasn’t comfortable sharing my
financial data with a 3rd party. I’ve tried to keep it simple, so it’s not a
pain to use.  But, I’ve also tried to keep it extensible, for others to try
and use.
<p>The last few months have been quite busy personally, and I haven’t been able
to use it as much as I would like to, but hopefully things will settle down
soon.  A couple of things that I’d like to improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Sqlite file is stored locally, and the data is not synced between
different computers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tagging/categorization of expenses is very manual, and a little bit
more automation would be handy.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<dt><a href="https://github.com/punchagan/artful-dodger/">artful-dodger</a></dt>
<dd>A Next.js project for hosting an art/photo gallery with
metadata stored in a Google Spreadsheet and images in a Google Drive (with an
optional CDN, recommended). I built this for a friend, who is experimenting
with creating “a more equitable model for curating, buying, and selling
art”. The gallery is currently in “private beta”, and I can’t link to
it. But, here’s a sample gallery <a href="https://punchagan.github.io/artful-dodger/">here</a>, whose configuration lives <a href="https://github.com/punchagan/artful-dodger/blob/main/.env.local.default">here</a>.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/punchagan/ox-gist">ox-gist</a></dt>
<dd>I released my first Emacs MELPA package – <a href="https://melpa.org/#/ox-gist">ox-gist</a> – an Orgmode
backend to export and update sub-trees and buffers to GitHub gists.  It was a
great experience contributing to MELPA.  I wrote a blog post about it <a href="https://punchagan.muse-amuse.in/blog/ox-gist/">too</a>.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/punchagan/android-dotfiles/tree/main/bin">Termux scripts</a></dt>
<dd>I’ve started using Termux on my Android phone and have
found the Text-to-Speech (TTS) API quite handy.  I’ve a couple of scripts on
my phone that lets me use TTS to read out contents on the clipboard or an
article from my browser.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/india-ultimate/fantasy">Fantasy League Site</a></dt>
<dd>With help from a bunch of volunteers collecting and
validating data, <a href="https://github.com/Joe2k">Jonny</a> and I built a <a href="https://fantasy.indiaultimate.org/">website</a> for the Fantasy League for
Indian Ultimate State Championships. There was nothing technically
challenging about the project, but it just involved a lot of data cleaning
and co-ordination between the volunteers. The data was collected using pen
and paper, instead of a digital app for collecting the stats.  This made the
data cleaning and validation significantly harder. I’d definitely push for
digital data collection if people try to do something like this again.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/punchagan/bookmarklets">Bookmarklets</a></dt>
<dd>A <a href="https://punchagan.github.io/bookmarklets/">web-page</a> with a bunch of Bookmarklets from my browser’s
Bookmarks bar. I’ve had most of them around for a while, but putting them on
a web page makes it easy to share and find myself on other
browsers/computers.</dd>
<dt>Music</dt>
<dd>Unlike 2021, I’ve only been able to record a couple of songs. And
this year (2023) hasn’t been any better, so far. I hope I’ll be able to make
amends to this, soon, though.</dd>

<h2 id="review-of-2021-projects">Review of 2021 projects</h2>
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/punchagan/earworm/">Earworm</a></dt>
<dd>I didn’t make any updates to the package, not because it’s perfect
but because I didn’t use it much in 2022 – thanks to how little I’ve been
able to record.
<p>While, writing this blog post I realized that workflow had a couple of
annoyances. I improved the code to fix them.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I need to move an audio file back-and-forth between my phone and my
laptop, one full round trip to add ID3 tags and cover image.  This makes
me put off uploading recorded files to the site.  Also, the new media file
needs to be named in a specific format.  I’ve added a new CLI subcommand
to automate all of this for me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I always need the full collection of the music files on the computer,
where I’m updating the site from. I can just <code>scp</code> the existing site onto
my computer and merge the media directories.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</dd>
<dt><a href="https://ukulele.muse-amuse.in/">Ukulele Tutorials Aggregator</a></dt>
<dd>The job of manually updating the site is a
lot of work, and I haven’t had the interest to keep doing it.</dd>
<dt>RPi Server and Phone Backup</dt>
<dd>The physical setup was accidentally dismantled
by folks I share my physical space with, and I haven’t been able to put back
everything in place, yet.  I’m hoping I’ll be able to get back to doing this
at some point this year.</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="outro">Outro</h2>
<p>I’ve already built a couple of small things in 2023, and I hope I am able to
find some interesting things to do this year.</p>
