    <h1>IBM sued for age discrimination by former global software director</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>IBM and its IT infrastructure spinoff Kyndryl were this week taken to court by an axed exec who had put decades of her life into the tech giant.</p>
<p>MaryKathryn Doheny, who served IBM for 23 years as a Certified Client Executive, transitioned to Kyndryl in September 2021 as Director of Global Software when it was carved from Big Blue.</p>
<p>In March this year, Kyndryl subjected her to a &#34;Resource Action&#34; – a euphemism for a layoff in IBM&#39;s world.</p>

    

<p>Doheny, age 64, sued both companies on Thursday for age discrimination, alleging that Kyndryl, though now an independent business, continues to execute IBM&#39;s strategy for getting rid of older workers, even down to using Big Blue&#39;s severance resources.</p>

        


        

<p>In February, 2022, IBM went to unusual lengths to distance itself from ProPublica&#39;s 2018 <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://features.propublica.org/ibm/ibm-age-discrimination-american-workers/">report</a> that it discriminated against employees on the basis of age and from the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)&#39;s <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/14/ibm_age_discrimination_finding/">findings</a> to that effect in 2020.</p>
<p>&#34;Discrimination of any kind is entirely against our culture and who we are at IBM, and there was (and is) no systemic age discrimination at our company,&#34; said IBM&#39;s Chief Human Resources Officer Nickle LaMoreaux in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-Chief-Human-Resources-Officer-Addresses-False-Claims-of-Systemic-Age-Discrimination">a public statement</a> posted to the company&#39;s website last year.</p>

        

<p>And yet IBM has been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/04/ibm_settles_more_discrimination_claims/">settling</a> many of the age discrimination cases filed against the corporation following the ProPublica report, not to mention <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ofccp/ofccp20211004-1">gender-</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/16/former_ibm_sales_manager_fired/">race-discrimination</a> claims.</p>
<p>Doheny&#39;s complaint, filed by Boston-based Lichten &amp; Liss-Riordan PC, contends that Kyndryl, as indicated by its use of terms like &#34;Resource Action&#34; and its reliance on IBM severance materials, has carried over IBM&#39;s alleged discriminatory layoff practices.</p>
<p>&#34;Unfortunately, Kyndryl has continued IBM’s playbook of age discrimination,&#34; the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.598685/gov.uscourts.nysd.598685.1.0.pdf">complaint</a> [PDF] says. &#34;It has recently laid off hundreds of employees, a group which appears to have included a disproportionately high number of employees over the age of forty (40).&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>Attorney Shannon Liss-Riordan, whose law firm represents Doheny, spoke to <em>The Register</em> by phone about the complaint.</p>
<p>&#34;We have been taking on IBM for a number of years now for targeting older workers and an attempt to build a younger workforce,&#34; said Liss-Riordan. &#34;And we&#39;ve had cases in court, we&#39;ve had many cases in arbitration. We uncovered <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/14/ibm_age_discrimination_court_documents/">pretty shocking evidence</a> of explicit discriminatory bias by top executives, and one would have thought that after all of this scrutiny, IBM would have put this behind them.&#34;</p>

        

<p>&#34;But unfortunately, we have reason to believe that it is continuing and it appears to be continuing with its new spin-off company Kyndryl.&#34;</p>
<h3>Targeted</h3>
<p>Liss-Riordan said that what&#39;s particularly troubling is that Kyndryl has now started a round of layoffs that seems to be replicating what IBM has done, where older workers bear the brunt of the job cuts.</p>
<p>&#34;IBM appears to be trying to distance itself from this and act as though it has nothing to do with this latest round of layoffs because [Kyndryl] is a new company,&#34; she said. &#34;But as we put forth in the complaint, IBM&#39;s fingerprints are all over this.&#34;</p>
<p>The complaint asserts that not only is Kyndryl using IBM terminology like &#34;Resource Action,&#34; but it is providing affected employees with the same information resources to do so, right down to the letter.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>As we put forth in the complaint, IBM&#39;s fingerprints are all over this</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#34;The severance package which Kyndryl has offered to laid off employees appears to be based on the severance packages that IBM had offered its laid off employees,&#34; the complaint states. &#34;Indeed, they even include the same language, font, and spacing. The resources that Kyndryl has provided electronically to laid off employees were provided on IBM URLs.&#34;</p>
<p>And to sign in to the portal associated with those URLs, Doheny is said to have had to provide her IBM employee identification number rather than her Kyndryl number.</p>
<p>Last month, when <em>The Register</em> wrote about layoffs at IBM and Kyndryl, a spokesperson for the spinoff wrote in to take issue with our headline, &#34;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/04/ibm_and_kyndryl_are_cutting/">IBM, Kyndryl cut jobs even after cutting ties</a>.&#34;</p>
<p>Kyndryl&#39;s spokesperson said, &#34;You may already be aware that we are a separate company, but the headline could lead someone to think there is a connection between us and IBM. To be sure, our actions have nothing to do with IBM’s.&#34;</p>
<p>Kyndryl did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Doheny&#39;s complaint. Neither did IBM for that matter.</p>
<p>Liss-Riordan said, &#34;[IBM&#39;s] attitude all along has been to deny, which is not unusual for a company accused of wrongdoing.&#34;</p>
<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>Her firm&#39;s litigation efforts also involve a pending argument before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals (In Re: IBM Arbitration Agreement, No. 22-1728 (2d Cir.)) on May 22 to challenge IBM&#39;s practice of using arbitration agreements to prevent people from pursuing discrimination claims.</p>
<p>IBM has been partially successful in compartmentalizing former employees&#39; complaints by preventing the sharing of evidence, she said.</p>
<p>&#34;When we would obtain this very incriminating evidence, in one case, IBM attempted to block us from using it in another case, claiming that arbitrations were confidential,&#34; explained Liss-Riordan. &#34;And we couldn&#39;t share evidence across cases.&#34;</p>
<p>IBM, she said, has often used arbitration clauses in severance agreements to prevent employee discrimination claims from ever being heard.</p>
<p>&#34;So this is an extremely important question for the Second Circuit to address now: whether a company can use arbitration to take away rights that an employee would have in court,&#34; said Liss-Riordan.</p>
<p>&#34;Unfortunately, after all of these years of litigation and the news coming out and the EEOC investigation, which reached the probable cause determination, it&#39;s just disappointing to see that IBM is still up to the same tricks.</p>
<p>&#34;So we filed [this complaint on behalf of MaryKathryn Doheny] and we may be seeking a court order to get notice out quickly to laid-off Kyndryl employees who have a very important choice to make because they&#39;ve been offered a severance agreement. And if they sign the severance agreement, they may be releasing their claims to pursue a discrimination charge.&#34; ®</p>
