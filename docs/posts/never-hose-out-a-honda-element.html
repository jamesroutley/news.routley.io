    <h1>Never hose out a Honda Element</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1529167844056_62558"><div>


<h2>How did the rumor begin?</h2><p>When the Model X (aka Honda Element Concept) appeared at auto shows in 2001, it was claimed that it &#34;can be hosed out&#34;.  Honda never printed this information to our knowledge, they only claimed it was &#34;washable&#34;, which it is, just not with a hose. Again this was a concept vehicle, not the production Element. Many of the features of the Model X did not make it into production (this is very common with concept vehicles).</p><p>Back to the rumor, here is the video that may have started it all (40 seconds in) &#34;You can kind of completely hose out the inside if you want to&#34; and &#34;This particle version has a lift up rear roof section&#34;. In the video you can clearly see that the rear roof does not lift up, but retracts. We know this is nit picking, we are pointing our that what the interviewee says and what the vehicle offers are actually different. Watch the entire video to see all the concepts that did not make it into production. Notice how careful they are with the vehicle, as if it could break at any moment, one of the fog light doesn&#39;t even work. A hose would have certainly destroyed the Model X as well.</p><p>Read the complete press release posted on the video (click though to the YouTube to read)</p><h3>excerpt from the press release</h3><blockquote><p><em>Model X was conceived at the inaugural X Games in San Diego in 1998.</em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em>While the silhouette of Model X provides a rough and tough appearance, the interior is designed to be resilient and </em><strong><em>&#34;washable.&#34;</em></strong><em> The interior floor is flat and wide and made of textured resin that is easy to clean.</em></p></blockquote>
