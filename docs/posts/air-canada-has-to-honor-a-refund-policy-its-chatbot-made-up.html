    <h1>Air Canada Has to Honor a Refund Policy Its Chatbot Made Up</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>After months of resisting, Air Canada was <a data-offer-url="https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bccrt/doc/2024/2024bccrt149/2024bccrt149.html" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bccrt/doc/2024/2024bccrt149/2024bccrt149.html&#34;}" href="https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bccrt/doc/2024/2024bccrt149/2024bccrt149.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">forced</a> to give a partial refund to a grieving passenger who was misled by an airline chatbot inaccurately explaining the airline&#39;s bereavement travel policy.</p><p>On the day Jake Moffatt&#39;s grandmother died, Moffat immediately visited Air Canada&#39;s website to book a flight from Vancouver to Toronto. Unsure of how Air Canada&#39;s bereavement rates worked, Moffatt asked Air Canada&#39;s chatbot to explain.</p><p>The chatbot provided inaccurate information, encouraging Moffatt to book a flight immediately and then request a refund within 90 days. In reality, Air Canada&#39;s policy explicitly stated that the airline will not provide refunds for bereavement travel after the flight is booked. Moffatt dutifully attempted to follow the chatbot&#39;s advice and request a refund but was shocked that the request was rejected.</p><p>Moffatt tried for months to convince Air Canada that a refund was owed, sharing a screenshot from the chatbot that clearly claimed:</p><blockquote><p>If you need to travel immediately or have already travelled and would like to submit your ticket for a reduced bereavement rate, kindly do so within 90 days of the date your ticket was issued by completing our Ticket Refund Application form.</p></blockquote><p>Air Canada argued that because the chatbot response elsewhere linked to a page with the actual bereavement travel policy, Moffatt should have known bereavement rates could not be requested retroactively. Instead of a refund, the best Air Canada would do was to promise to update the chatbot and offer Moffatt a $200 coupon to use on a future flight.</p><p>Unhappy with this resolution, Moffatt refused the coupon and filed a small claims complaint in Canada&#39;s Civil Resolution Tribunal.</p><p>According to Air Canada, Moffatt never should have trusted the chatbot and the airline should not be liable for the chatbot&#39;s misleading information because, Air Canada essentially argued, &#34;the chatbot is a separate legal entity that is responsible for its own actions,&#34; a <a data-offer-url="https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bccrt/doc/2024/2024bccrt149/2024bccrt149.html" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bccrt/doc/2024/2024bccrt149/2024bccrt149.html&#34;}" href="https://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bccrt/doc/2024/2024bccrt149/2024bccrt149.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">court order</a> said.</p><p>Experts <a data-offer-url="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/air-canada-told-it-is-responsible-for-errors-by-its-website-chatbot" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/air-canada-told-it-is-responsible-for-errors-by-its-website-chatbot&#34;}" href="https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/air-canada-told-it-is-responsible-for-errors-by-its-website-chatbot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">told the <em>Vancouver Sun</em></a> that Moffatt&#39;s case appeared to be the first time a Canadian company tried to argue that it wasn&#39;t liable for information provided by its chatbot.</p><p>Tribunal member Christopher Rivers, who decided the case in favor of Moffatt, called Air Canada&#39;s defense &#34;remarkable.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Air Canada argues it cannot be held liable for information provided by one of its agents, servants, or representatives—including a chatbot,&#34; Rivers wrote. &#34;It does not explain why it believes that is the case&#34; or &#34;why the webpage titled &#39;Bereavement travel&#39; was inherently more trustworthy than its chatbot.&#34;</p><p>Further, Rivers found that Moffatt had &#34;no reason&#34; to believe that one part of Air Canada&#39;s website would be accurate and another would not.</p><p>Air Canada &#34;does not explain why customers should have to double-check information found in one part of its website on another part of its website,&#34; Rivers wrote.</p><p>In the end, Rivers ruled that Moffatt was entitled to a partial refund of $650.88 in Canadian dollars off the original fare (about $482 USD), which was $1,640.36 CAD (about $1,216 USD), as well as additional damages to cover interest on the airfare and Moffatt&#39;s tribunal fees.</p><p>Air Canada told Ars it will comply with the ruling and considers the matter closed.</p><p>Air Canada’s Chatbot Appears to Be Disabled</p><p>When Ars visited Air Canada&#39;s website on Friday, there appeared to be no chatbot support available, suggesting that Air Canada has disabled the chatbot.</p><p>Air Canada did not respond to Ars&#39; request to confirm whether the chatbot is still part of the airline&#39;s online support offerings.</p></div></div></div></div>
