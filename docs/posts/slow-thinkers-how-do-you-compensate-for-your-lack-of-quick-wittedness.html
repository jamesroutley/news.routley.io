    <h1>Ask HN: Slow thinkers, how do you compensate for your lack of quick-wittedness?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Slow thinking HN members, what are some strategies you&#39;ve use to overcome and compensate for the lack of quick thinking.</p><p>E.g. I found I&#39;m great at analysis or putting together elaborate argument but if I&#39;m in a situation where I need to make a quick decision or get in actual argument I lose all of that capacity and usually drop to the level of IQ 85 if I/m to be judged by the outcomes. Nevertheless a slow thinker does have that potential there he&#39;s jut not able to tap into it if he falls into my category. In martial arts, rehearsing overcomes a lot of that - what has worked in real life for you?</p></div></div></div>
