    <h1>The hit film about overworked nurses that&#39;s causing alarm across Europe</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p><span>T</span>he world could face a <a href="https://nursesinternational.org/2023/05/global-nursing-shortage-by-2030/" data-link-name="in body link">shortage of 13 million nurses by the end of this decade</a>. For her new film, Swiss director Petra Volpe imagined the consequences of just one missed shift on a busy night at a hospital, and found herself making a disaster movie.</p><p>With Late Shift, Volpe aimed to shine a light on the frontlines of the looming healthcare catastrophe through the eyes of the dedicated, exhausted Floria. Played by German actor Leonie Benesch, the young nurse shows an initially acrobatic grace in her workday, whose first half resembles a particularly hectic episode of the restaurant kitchen series The Bear, but with life-and-death stakes.</p><p>Arriving for her shift cheery and energetic and taking the time to ask about her colleague’s recent holiday, Floria soon hears that another nurse has called in sick. The looming workload suddenly grows exponentially, compounding the stress and driving up the likelihood she will make a fateful mistake.</p><p>The Swiss-born Volpe says she chose the film’s German title <em>Heldin</em> (Heroine) because it took a mythic term often reserved for warriors and applied it to the bravery and self-sacrifice of care work.</p><figure id="3b22a182-2dc7-4376-a967-887237708dce" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77e8170e51383cf434dca19337fecd8d192ad42e/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77e8170e51383cf434dca19337fecd8d192ad42e/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77e8170e51383cf434dca19337fecd8d192ad42e/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77e8170e51383cf434dca19337fecd8d192ad42e/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77e8170e51383cf434dca19337fecd8d192ad42e/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77e8170e51383cf434dca19337fecd8d192ad42e/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Leonie Benesch in Late Shift." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77e8170e51383cf434dca19337fecd8d192ad42e/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>‘The work is extremely complex and emotionally charged’ … Leonie Benesch in Late Shift.</span> Photograph: Salvatore Vinci</figcaption></figure><p>“This work, which is extremely complex and emotionally charged, is completely devalued in our societies,” Volpe says. “I find it very symptomatic because it’s women’s work – 80% of the people [in many countries] who do this work are female.”</p><p>Volpe was inspired by a longtime roommate who worked as a nurse, and by the autobiographical novel Our Profession Is Not the Problem – It’s the Circumstances by German former care worker Madeline Calvelage, who advised her on the script.</p><p>“My heart was pounding from the first chapter and I thought to myself – this reads like a thriller,” Volpe says. “But within that stress you find the most tender, human moments.”</p><p>The film revolves around the escalating and competing needs of patients on a hospital ward, with a different set of medical and emotional demands lurking behind each door, signalled to the staff by a shrieking call bell.</p><p>Benesch’s turbo-driven career has already included roles on The Crown and Babylon Berlin as well as film parts in Michael Haneke’s The White Ribbon, Munich Olympics attacks drama September 5 and German Oscar nominee The Teachers’ Lounge. She says a common thread in her most recent characters is “people who burn for what they do”. But she notes it was rare in TV medical dramas to see nurses and their everyday feats front and centre.</p><figure id="5c7423ae-ac86-4337-a36f-408898254ed1" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56958e03f04768d7308887a681e40c1761eb57b6/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56958e03f04768d7308887a681e40c1761eb57b6/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56958e03f04768d7308887a681e40c1761eb57b6/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56958e03f04768d7308887a681e40c1761eb57b6/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56958e03f04768d7308887a681e40c1761eb57b6/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56958e03f04768d7308887a681e40c1761eb57b6/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Nursing staff from various hospitals in Berlin demonstrate in front of the Zoo Palast on the fringes of the premiere of Heldin in February." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56958e03f04768d7308887a681e40c1761eb57b6/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.637" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Nursing staff from various hospitals in Berlin demonstrate in front of the Zoo Palast on the fringes of the premiere of Heldin in February.</span> Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/Alamy</figcaption></figure><p>“You’re used to getting the physicians as the heroes and then in the backdrop a nurse might hang an infusion bag or drink a coffee or have an affair with the senior doctor,” Benesch says. “Before this it wasn’t clear to me how much of the actual medical responsibility rests on nurses’ shoulders.”</p><p>Benesch, who trained at London’s Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama, said she spent several shifts trailing real nurses at a Swiss hospital to learn the “choreography” of interactions between staff and patients, and the manual skills of prepping a syringe or taking blood pressure. “I wanted real nurses not to be able to tell the difference between me and a professional,” she says. “I just hope people aren’t scared off by a film with subtitles because the story is absolutely universal.”</p><p>Late Shift has stoked heated policy reform debates and proved a critical and box office success in German-speaking Europe, even besting the latest Bridget Jones movie in Swiss cinemas.</p><p>At the world premiere at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/berlinfilmfestival" data-link-name="in body link">Berlin film festival</a> in February, several nurses were invited to appear in their uniforms on the red carpet and take the stage after the screening for a round of applause.

Asked what she’d advise Floria, Aurich says: “I would say go back to work tomorrow because like her I can’t imagine doing anything else with my life. But join a union, so you don’t have as many shifts like this one.”</p><figure id="4a991fe8-993b-4d1a-8273-68360b9e5818" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:20,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Late Shift review – pressure is on in badly understaffed hospital as compassion shines through&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;4a991fe8-993b-4d1a-8273-68360b9e5818&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/29/late-shift-review-pressure-is-on-in-badly-understaffed-hospital-as-compassion-shines-through&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;design&#34;:10,&#34;display&#34;:2,&#34;theme&#34;:3}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-20 | 20" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>Volpe, who divides her time between Berlin and New York, says she was gratified to see nurses going in groups to see the film, and hopes it will make the rest of the audience into better patients. “Nurses should be at the very top of our social hierarchy but we live in a world where it’s just the opposite,” she says. “This film is a love letter to the profession.”</p><p>While the film is set in Europe’s creaking but still intact social infrastructure, Volpe said she saw in the US where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/04/rural-americans-medicaid-cuts-trump-bill" data-link-name="in body link">Donald Trump’s swingeing cuts to Medicaid,</a> which mainly serves poor and disabled people, threatened to hurt the most vulnerable. “You see a great cruelty in all these measures,” she says.</p><p>“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2025/apr/08/empathy-sin-christian-right-musk-trump" data-link-name="in body link">Elon Musk said he saw empathy as the biggest problem of our time </a>which is of course completely monstrous.
