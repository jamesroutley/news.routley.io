<p>More than a decade ago, when I was applying to graduate school, I went through a period of deep uncertainty. I had tried the previous year and hadn’t gotten in anywhere. I wanted to try again, but I had a lot going against me.</p>



<p>I’d spent most of my undergrad building a student job-portal startup and hadn’t balanced it well with academics. My GPA needed explaining. My GMAT score was just okay. I didn’t come from a big-brand employer. And there was no shortage of people with similar or stronger profiles applying to the same schools.</p>



<p>Even though I had learned a few things from the first round, the second attempt was still difficult. There were multiple points after I submitted applications where I lost hope.</p>



<p>But during that stretch, a friend and colleague kept repeating one line to me:</p>



<p><em>“All it takes is for one to work out.”</em></p>



<p>He’d say it every time I spiraled. And as much as it made me smile, a big part of me didn’t fully believe it. Still, it became a little maxim between us. And eventually, he was right – that one did work out. And it changed my life.</p>



<p>I’ve thought about that framing so many times since then.</p>



<p>It’s unbelievably powerful in any high-stakes search:</p>



<p>You don’t need every job to choose you. You just need the one that’s the right fit. </p>



<p>You don’t need every house to accept your offer. You just need the one that feels like home. </p>



<p>You don’t need every person to want to build a life with you. You just need the one.</p>



<p>You don’t need ten universities to say yes. You just need the one that opens the right door.</p>



<p>These processes – college admissions, job searches, home buying, finding a partner – can be emotionally brutal. They can get you down in ways that feel personal. But in those moments, that truth can be grounding.</p>



<p>All it takes is for one to work out.</p>



<p>And that one is all you need.</p>
