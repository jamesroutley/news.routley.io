</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642947024275_56520"><div><p>It‚Äôs easy to feel out of your depth at the start of a project. There are a gazillion things you don‚Äôt know yet, but you <em>need</em> to know them because everyone‚Äôs looking to you for answers. You might not be sure yet what success looks like, or what the constraints are, or even 100% what your job is here, but here you are being expected to have opinions and direction and thoughts on what the first milestones will be. It can get a little imposter-y. ‚ÄúCan I really achieve this thing? Should they have picked someone else?‚Äù (They shouldn‚Äôt. You‚Äôve got this.)</p><p><strong>Is it just me or‚Ä¶</strong></p><p>So I changed direction with the chapter and started by writing about all of the <em>feelings</em> at the start, and about being overwhelmed. But a few paragraphs in I started to doubt myself. Yes, I was writing the advice I needed a decade ago, but did <em>anyone else</em> need this? Past-me is my first audience, always, but I probably shouldn‚Äôt write a whole book just for her. So I took the question to the #staff-principal-engineering channel on <a href="https://randsinrepose.com/welcome-to-rands-leadership-slack/"><strong>Rands Leadership Slack</strong></a>, a little nervous that everyone would say ‚ÄúUh, no? Competent people never feel like that. Oh, you sometimes do? ‚Ä¶Interesting.‚Äù üòÖ</p><p>But nah, that‚Äôs not the kind of place it is.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642359679072_20815"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642359679072_24233"><div><p>The conversation that followed was empathetic and vulnerable and low-ego, as it almost always is on that channel. People shared stories and talked about what had worked for them and what hadn‚Äôt. I left with a sense that, yeah, this feeling of overwhelm affects a lot of people, and also with some more ideas for what to say about it. And I don‚Äôt know for sure, but I bet that some folks who are newer to leading projects saw that conversation and felt a little more secure, a little safer in their roles.</p><p><strong>Community</strong></p><p>Staff+ folks haven‚Äôt had a lot of community until recently. It‚Äôs been a weird job, sort of under the radar and under-discussed for a long time. I remember writing that I love the <a href="https://leaddev.com">Lead Dev conferences</a> because <a href="https://noidea.dog/blog/leaddevnewyork2019">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the few conferences that really acknowledge that the senior IC path exists and is a thing people might want to do.‚Äù</a>, but even at Lead Dev conferences I didn‚Äôt meet a <em>ton</em> of Staff engineers: it was more likely to be managers. Lovely managers, to be clear, but people coming from a different context and different concerns. Staff engineers didn‚Äôt really have a place to show up and ask ‚Äúuh, does anyone else not really know what their job is?‚Äù or ‚Äúdoes it matter where in the org chart I report in to?‚Äù or ‚Äúshould I be coding more/less than I am? /o\‚Äù You know, the classics. üòÅ </p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642947028688_19194"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1642947028688_23556"><div><p>Tell me if I‚Äôm wrong about this, but I think that two years ago, there were no Staff+ communities at all. Maybe there were some company-internal things, but I don‚Äôt know of anything public. The RLS #staff-principal-engineering channel didn‚Äôt exist until February 2020 and even that was quiet at the start, enough that the Slack‚Äôs cleanup automation had the channel on a list for deletion a couple of months later. But it survived and ramped up and now it‚Äôs a busy place. I like it a lot.</p><p><strong>Conferences</strong></p><p>The last two years have had an explosion of Staff+ content. Last summer the <a href="https://leaddev.com">Lead Dev</a> folks ran <a href="https://leaddev.com/course/leaddev-live?active_module_id=9781"><strong>Staff Plus Live</strong></a>, a one day virtual conference. I cohosted so obviously I&#39;m biased but it really was a fantastic experience and the energy of the ‚Äúhallway track‚Äù in the #staffplus channel of the Lead Dev Slack was like nothing I‚Äôd ever seen before. As someone said afterwards, ‚Äúit felt like a community finding each other for the first time‚Äù. </p><p>Lead Dev have done a bunch more panels and webinars for Staff+ folks since then, (like <a href="https://leaddev.com/events/influencing-without-management-authority-senior-individual-contributor">this one</a> and <a href="https://leaddev.com/ic-leadership/making-bigger-impact-through-collaboration-senior-individual-contributor">this one</a> and <a href="https://leaddev.com/ic-leadership/understanding-role-principal-engineer">this one</a>), and <a href="https://leaddev.com/staffplus/how-expand-your-scope-staff-plus-engineer">some</a> <a href="https://leaddev.com/process/getting-big-changes-implemented-staff-level">great</a> <a href="https://leaddev.com/career-paths-progression-promotion/reality-being-principal-engineer">articles</a> <a href="https://leaddev.com/audience-insights/who-are-staff-principal-and-distinguished-engineers">too</a>. It‚Äôs all excellent stuff, so I was a bit starry-eyed ü§©when they told me they were aiming to do a conference in New York in April and invited me to be part of it. The schedule for <a href="https://leaddev.com/staffplus-new-york"><strong>Staff Plus New York</strong></a><strong> </strong>(April 4th and 5th, 2022), just went up on the site, and I‚Äôm delighted that there‚Äôs at least one presentation about the need for community: David Daly‚Äôs talk on <a href="https://leaddev.com/staffplus-new-york/agenda">building peer groups</a>. But the whole schedule looks amazing. I‚Äôm really looking forward to this conference. The idea of an entire conference where almost everyone is a Staff+ engineer kind of blows my mind. </p><p>It looks like <a href="https://plus.qconferences.com/plus2022/track/staff-plus-engineer-path"><strong>QCon</strong></a> has a Staff+ track coming soon at a future conference too. I haven‚Äôt heard anything about this track yet, but I‚Äôm excited for what they come up with. (If anyone reading this knows more, I‚Äôd love to hear.) And I‚Äôm seeing a ton of incidental other articles about the IC track, medium posts, Twitter lists, and company blogs explaining what Staff+ means to them. [Edit: and I forgot to mention this <a href="https://podcast.staffeng.com">podcast</a>!] I love it all.</p><p><strong>Thanks, Will!</strong></p><p>Of course I attribute all of this to Will Larson, who started his site <a href="http://staffeng.com">staffeng.com</a> around two years ago: the snowball that kicked off the avalanche. Will‚Äôs interviews with people doing Staff+ roles showed models for different ways to do the job, and became a focus point that let Staff+ folks start finding each other. If you haven‚Äôt read Will‚Äôs book, <a href="https://staffeng.com/book">Staff Engineer</a>, I recommend it a lot.</p><p>Staff engineering is still a kind of a weird and ambiguous job. I think that‚Äôs the strength of it‚Äìwe adapt to the needs of the situation. But the ambiguity means we even more need a community and the ability to learn from each other. I‚Äôm happy that‚Äôs coming together at last.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
