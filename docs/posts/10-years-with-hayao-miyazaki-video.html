    <h1>10 years with Hayao Miyazaki [video]</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>An exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at the genius of Japan&#39;s foremost living film director, Hayao Miyazaki -- creator of some of the world&#39;s most iconic and enduring anime feature films. Miyazaki allowed a single documentary filmmaker to shadow him at work, as he dreamed up characters and plot lines for what would become his 2008 blockbuster, &#34;Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea.&#34; Miyazaki explores the limits of his physical ability and imagination to conjure up memorable protagonists. This program is the first of a 4-part documentary, &#34;10 Years with Hayao Miyazaki.&#34;</p>
