    <h1>Show HN: Tech Compensation in Europe</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><strong>The same role <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/">can pay 2-4x more at different companies</a> in tech.</strong> However, it&#39;s extremely hard to tell which companies pay more, and which pay less. I&#39;m building this site to democratize access to compensation information in Europe for anyone in tech.</p>
      <p>I&#39;ve been a hiring manager in the UK and the Netherlands, working at companies like Uber and Skyscanner. I saw how the tech market is becoming <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/">increasingly trimodal</a> in compensation.</p>
      <p>
          <strong>But how much do <em>specific</em> companies pay in Europe?</strong> How is compensation structured? What benefits do they offer? If we had access to this information, it would make job hunting and offer negotiation much easier. 
          I would know - as I helped several people in tech negotiate <a href="https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1392090746988208128?s=20">up to â‚¬45,000 more per year in compensation at big tech companies</a>. 
          Negotiation is much easier when you know how high you can reasonably go up to - which is what this site helps with.
      </p>
      <p><strong>The site is built with anonymous compensation sharing in mind</strong>. I know that many people are uncomfortable sharing compensation that can identify them. For example, if you&#39;re the only person with a specific title at a small company, you can be identified easily if you share your data. This is why you can choose to anonymize the data you share: meaning details on company name or title are only shown if multiple people from the same company or same title share their compensation.</p>
      <p><strong>This site is focused on Europe</strong> because this is the market I know very well, and because I found no good tech compensation sites for Europe. European compensation is different from US or other regional ones in many ways, and this site attempts to capture all of this.</p>
      <p><strong>The site is work in progress</strong> and being built by <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/">Gergely Orosz</a>. If you have thoughts or feedback, please send it to hello (at) techpays.com .</p>
