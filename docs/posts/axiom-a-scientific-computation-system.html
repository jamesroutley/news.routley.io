  Axiom is a general purpose Computer Algebra system. It is useful for
  research and development of mathematical algorithms. It defines a
  strongly typed, mathematically correct type hierarchy. It has a
  programming language and a built-in compiler.

  Axiom has been in development since 1971. At that time, it was called
  Scratchpad. Scratchpad was a large, general purpose computer algebra
  system that was originally developed by IBM under the direction of
  Richard Jenks.  The project started in 1971 and evolved slowly.  Barry
  Trager was key to the technical direction of the project. Scratchpad
  developed over a 20 year stretch and was basically considered as a
  research platform for developing new ideas in computational
  mathematics. In the 1990s, as IBM&#39;s fortunes slid, the Scratchpad
  project was renamed to Axiom, sold to the Numerical Algorithms Group
  (NAG) in England and became a commercial system.  As part of the
  Scratchpad project at IBM in Yorktown

  worked on all aspects
  of the system and eventually helped transfer the product to NAG. For a
  variety of reasons it never became a financial success and NAG
  withdrew it from the market in October, 2001.

  NAG agreed to release Axiom as free software. The basic motivation was
  that Axiom represents something different from other programs in a lot
  of ways. Primarily because of its foundation in mathematics the Axiom
  system will potentially be useful 30 years from now.  In its current
  state it represents about 30 years and 300 man-years of research
  work. To strive to keep such a large collection of knowledge alive
  seems a worthwhile goal.

  Efforts are underway to extend this software to 
  </p><ul>
  <li> (a) develop a better user interface 
  </li><li> (b) make it useful as a teaching tool 
  </li><li> (c) develop an algebra server protocol 
  </li><li> (d) integrate additional mathematics 
  </li><li> (e) rebuild the algebra in a literate programming style 
  </li><li> (f) integrate logic programming 
  </li><li> (g) develop an Axiom Journal with refereed submissions.
