    <h1>US consumer spending dashboard built on data from 50M&#43; cards now on Snowflake</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-testid="dimension-transition-content"><div><div><p>The Consumer Spending Foundation App includes consumer card transactions (i.e., credit/debit) from over 50M cards in the United States to show spend trends across companies and industries. The card panel is made up of data from a number of banks and financial institutions and aggregated to create a representative panel of activity in the US consumer economy.

The app uses Streamlit to create an interactive dashboard where users can visualize historical sales patterns and compare trends across industries and companies. Trends are further broken down into trends by demographic groups including age and income brackets. The interactive dashboard allows users to quickly explore high-level information before diving into the underlying data for a custom analysis.

Measures in the data include the following:
* Sales
* Transactions
* Average order value (AOV)

More detail
Snowflake Native Apps are a type of application that operate within the Snowflake environment. They allow users to use Snowflake resources to access interactive charts and functions (UDFs) to visualize and process data while keeping all data within the Snowflake ecosystem for a more integrated user experience.

The data is available at the company, NAICS industry (MARTS) and merchant category code (MCC) levels. Additionally, the data is cut by demographics including both age ranges and income brackets. Data is aggregated to quarterly, monthly, and weekly periods.

All Cybersyn products follow the EAV (entity, attributes, value) model with a unified schema. Entities are tangible objects (e.g. geography, company). Entities may have characteristics (i.e. descriptors of the entity) in an index table and values (i.e. statistics, measure) in a timeseries table. Refer to Cybersyn Concepts for more details. [Visit docs.cybersyn.com for more details.]

The listings contains the following tables:
* consumer_spending_timeseries - year-over-year measures of spend and transactions by date with data going back to the start of 2019
* consumer_spending_attributes - detailed breakdowns of each series available in the consumer_spending_timeseries table. Joinable on variable
* company_index - Log of company entities and common identifiers used in Cybersyâ€™s data. Joinable to the consumer_spending_timeseries</p></div></div></div></div></div>
