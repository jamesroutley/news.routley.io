      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>A couple of years back I started dabbling in the social sciences and humanities (my background is in ecology / evolutionary biology), and became interested in one discipline after another. From psychology to history of science to anthropology and sociology, to economics and politics, to philosophy and religious studies and cultural studies, etc.<p>I find it intrinsically motivating to move from ignorance slowly towards understanding. I love reading textbooks to learn basic concepts and looking through academic titles just to swim in their ideas.</p><p>While I loved university, I won&#39;t be able to handle the demands of formal schooling (especially not while raising a family). I also wouldn&#39;t want to do any advanced research degrees as I have no patience in studying a small set of problems (I tried it for science and it was horrendous).</p><p>While I have no issue just continuing to explore these subjects privately, I feel like something is missing. I feel like I want to do something more tangible with this breadth of interests, but I&#39;m coming up empty in terms of ideas. I like writing and can imagine having some sort of blog, but that&#39;s seems so cliche?</p><p>Any suggestions? Perhaps examples of something others have done with their broad interests?</p><p>What does one do with an intellectual life other than swimming through intellectual content?</p></td></tr>
