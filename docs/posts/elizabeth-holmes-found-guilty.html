    <h1>Elizabeth Holmes found guilty</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and former CEO of blood-testing company Theranos, on Monday was found guilty of conspiracy and fraud against certain investors by a California jury. </p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Holmes was the poster child of Silicon Valley hubris, taking &#34;fake it till you make it&#34; to illegal extremes. She was found not guilty on several charges relating to patients and company ads in Arizona. </p><ul><li>Holmes was found guilty of four charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud with regards to certain investors (though the jury <a data-vars-link-text="couldn&#39;t reach a verdict" data-vars-click-url="https://www.axios.com/elizabeth-holmes-deadlock-jury-855f9ff2-c69a-4878-9056-533ca860d0cc.html" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.axios.com/elizabeth-holmes-deadlock-jury-855f9ff2-c69a-4878-9056-533ca860d0cc.html" target="_self">couldn&#39;t reach a verdict</a> in the case of three counts relating to investors). </li><li>Holmes is expected to appeal. Each guilty verdict carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison though she would likely serve them concurrently, the <a data-vars-link-text="New York Times notes" data-vars-click-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/03/technology/elizabeth-holmes-trial-verdict" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/03/technology/elizabeth-holmes-trial-verdict" target="_blank">New York Times notes</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>This case was specifically about what Holme</strong>s told Theranos investors, although her lies also impacted partners and patients.</p><ul><li>The company raised over $1 billion, including at a valuation of nearly $11 billion, from an eclectic mix of investors that included Rupert Murdoch, Tim Draper, Betsy DeVos, James Mattis, the Walton family and the Cox family. </li><li>Theranos dissolved in 2018, laying off all remaining employees and giving back what little cash it had left to creditors.</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Prosecutors keyed in on what they called &#34;knowingly false statements&#34; made by Holmes, particularly over what could and couldn&#39;t be done by Theranos&#39; blood analysis technology.</p><ul><li>Defense attorneys portrayed Holmes as more naïve than duplicitous, and as the victim — both psychologically and sexually — of former Theranos COO Sunny Balwani, whose own trial is slated for next year.</li></ul><p><strong>What&#39;s next:</strong> During a hearing next week, federal prosecutors are expected to tell the court how they&#39;d like to proceed with the three counts that have been declared a mistrial. </p><ul><li>While Holmes will not be detained for now, prosecutors have asked for her to be out on a secured bond. A sentencing hearing will be set at a later date. </li><li>Balwani is now set to stand his own trial on similar charges, next month. </li></ul><p><em>Editor&#39;s note: This post has been updated with new details throughout. </em></p></div></div>
