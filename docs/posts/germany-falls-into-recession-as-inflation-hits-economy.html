Industrial orders are also weaker, reflecting the impact of higher energy prices on businesses.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The persistence of high price increases continued to be a burden on the German economy at the start of the year,&#34; the federal statistics agency Destatis <a href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2023/05/PE23_203_811.html">said in a statement</a>.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Originally, the agency had estimated zero growth for the first quarter of this year, suggesting Germany would side-step a recession.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, the revised figures showed household spending was 1.2% lower than in the previous quarter. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Government spending was 4.9% lower, and car sales also fell after government grants for electric and hybrid cars were scaled back.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The recession was less severe than some had predicted, given Germany&#39;s heavy reliance on Russian energy. A mild winter and the reopening of China&#39;s economy, helped ease the impact of higher energy prices.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Private sector investment and exports rose, but that was not enough to get Germany out of the &#34;danger zone&#34; for recession, analysts said.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The early indicators suggest that things will continue to be similarly weak in the second quarter [of 2023],&#34; said LBBW bank analyst Jens-Oliver Niklasch.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, the German central bank, the Bundesbank, expects the economy to grow modestly in the April to June quarter, with a rebound in industry offsetting stagnating consumer spending.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The IMF has predicted that <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2023/04/11/world-economic-outlook-april-2023">Germany will be the weakest</a> of the world&#39;s advanced economies, shrinking 0.1% this year, after it upgraded<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65669399"> its forecast for the UK from minus 0.3% to growth of 0.4%</a>.</p></div></div></article></div></div>
