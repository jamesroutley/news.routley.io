  <p>I’ve published a Lua implementation of TypeId:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/pushcx/typeid-lua">https://github.com/pushcx/typeid-lua</a></p>

<p>TypeID is a nice standard for creating unique id tokens with a Stripe-like<label for="stripe"> ⊕</label><span>An aside to Stripe from an Xtripe: Please write a <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/engineering">eng blog</a> post about the features and history of tokens. It would be pillar content that would be enormously popular for meaningfully advancing the state of the art to a new standard (Not the post about <a href="https://dev.to/stripe/designing-apis-for-humans-object-ids-3o5a">using them</a>.)</span>

  <p>TypeIDs are a modern, type-safe extension of UUIDv7. Inspired by a similar use of prefixes in Stripe’s APIs.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>TypeIDs are canonically encoded as lowercase strings consisting of three parts:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>A type prefix (at most 63 characters in all lowercase snake_case ASCII [a-z_]).</li>
    <li>An underscore ‘_’ separator</li>
    <li>A 128-bit UUIDv7 encoded as a 26-character string using a modified base32 encoding.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s an example of a TypeID of type <code>user</code>:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <div><div><pre><code>user_2x4y6z8a0b1c2d3e4f5g6h7j8k
└──┘ └────────────────────────┘
type    uuid suffix (base32)
</code></pre></div>  </div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>A <a href="https://github.com/jetify-com/typeid/tree/main/spec">formal specification</a> defines the encoding in more detail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cleverly, the spec comes with a suite of labeled <a href="https://github.com/jetify-com/typeid/tree/main/spec">test
cases</a> of valid and invalid
examples.
I wish more specs did this!</p>

<p>I’m happy with the functionality my library offers, and there was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ducG55pfCMQ">familiar delight of making things</a> the first time I round-tripped a TypeID.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>TypeID</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;typeid&#34;</span><span>)</span>
<span>-- or in dev: TypeID = require(&#34;./typeid&#34;)</span>

<span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeID</span><span>.</span><span>generate</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;comment&#34;</span><span>)</span>
<span>-- t = {</span>
<span>--   prefix = &#34;comment&#34;,</span>
<span>--   suffix = &#34;01jvbhbbdje07rnyqkvstpvcge&#34;</span>
<span>-- }</span>

<span>-- TypeID tables implement __tostring</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>-- &#34;comment_01jvbhbbdje07rnyqkvstpvcge&#34;</span>

<span>-- You can extract a standard UUID string</span>
<span>t</span><span>:</span><span>uuid</span><span>()</span> <span>-- &#34;0196d715-adb2-700f-8afa-f3de756db20e&#34;</span>

<span>-- and round trip that back into a TypeID</span>
<span>TypeID</span><span>.</span><span>from_uuid_string</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;comment&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;0196d715-adb2-700f-8afa-f3de756db20e&#34;</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- parse and validate a TypeID from a string</span>
<span>TypeID</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;comment_01jvbhbbdje07rnyqkvstpvcge&#34;</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- finally, you can generate with a unix timestamp in ms:</span>
<span>TypeID</span><span>.</span><span>generate</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;comment&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>-- &#34;comment_0000000001e8avt0nh7a68v2jc&#34;</span>

<p>This was a fun practice project for me.
I’ve used Lua more and more over the last few years in video game scripts and <a href="https://awesomewm.org/">my window manager</a>,
and while 1-based array indexes will always feel odd, I think there’s a lot of potential in the language.</p>

<p>I experimented with style while implementing, and a lot of what I’m taking away from it is idioms I’m ignorant of.
The <code>TypeID</code> is more OO style and returns an object with a method; the <code>Base32</code> and <code>UUID7</code> modules work on primitives.
After implementing, I guess users would probably prefer getting a primitive back, as there doesn’t seem to be an idiomatic way to type-check.
A module can export a trusted constructor, but without types there’s no way to
use that to prevent instantiating invalid objects; everything is a table anyways.
Coming from Ruby and ActiveRecord it’s frustrating to have most of a solution to the pervasive problem of passing around invalid objects but not be able to complete it.</p>

<p>I guess have to read popular libraries to get a feel for style.
I don’t really know what level to aim at between “data-hiding high-level interface” and “yolo, all primitives and seams showing for perf”.
Maybe it’s different inside and outside of games.</p>

<p>Along those lines, I ported <code>Base32</code> from the official TypeID Golang implementation and then wrote <code>UUID7</code> in bytes to match it.
But all that intermediate bit twiddling could be simplified by generating a UUID7 directly into the Base32 encoding if I wanted to spend a lot more time on this.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m looking under the wrong name, but it seems odd there isn’t a bitfield type I could use, given Lua’s popularity in games.
Some searching turned up <a href="https://github.com/JohnHind/Lua_Bitfield">a library</a> but the absence of multi-bit operations seems inconvenient.
Which points to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- typeid.lua</span>
<span>uuid</span> <span>=</span> <span>function</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>UUID7</span><span>.</span><span>to_string</span><span>(</span><span>Base32</span><span>.</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>suffix</span><span>))</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There’s a code smell in <code>TypeID</code>: the nested conversions in the metatable <code>uuid</code> function suggest the internal representation of <code>suffix</code> is wrong.
The syntactic distinction between <code>.field</code> and <code>:method()</code> means duplicating the data into two fields, exposing the internal representation by it being a field and the other a method, or getting away from what seems like common struct-y style and making both into methods.
I’ve really grown to like the way Ruby’s optional parenthesis blur the line on fields and methods.</p>

<p>I wrote this library because I’d like to add a TypeID request identifier as a trace ID that nginx would generate and log, and pass along through Rails logs to MariaDB logs.
It’s overkill for <a href="https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters">Lobsters</a> but once a year I really wanted the ability to correlate logs like that.
While the ROI may not really justify the time, it was a uniquely well-scoped small practice project.</p>

<p>Writing in Lua and adding the Lua module support to nginx seemed an easier path than writing in C and adding that compilation step to the deploy pipeline.
Ultimately though, I’m not going to write that wrapper module.</p>

<p>On a parallel track, our <a href="https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters-ansible">ansible setup</a> has slowly been succumbing to bit rot and my inexpert maintenance.
I learned that <a href="https://hatchbox.io">Hatchbox</a> could fill the same role and paying a couple bucks a month means it’s maintained by an expert professional.
So <a href="https://lobste.rs/~355e3b">355e3b</a> are going to move our hosting over soon, and it uses <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddy_\(web_server\)">Caddy</a> instead of nginx, so I guess I’ll wrap the official TypeID <a href="https://github.com/jetify-com/typeid-go">Golang implementation</a> in a Caddy module instead.
Still, it’s rewarding to <a href="https://github.com/jetify-com/opensource/pull/494">contribute to TypeID’s list of supported languages</a>.</p>
