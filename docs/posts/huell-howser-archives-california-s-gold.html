For a guided tour with our archives staff, please make an appointment during our appointment hours (see below). Please book guided tours at least two weeks in advance. The exhibit space is small; about the size of one classroom. Most visits will take approximately 40-60 minutes. Research visits are by appointment and scheduled on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p><strong>Hours, walk-in:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Closed Saturday and Sunday<br/>

<p><strong>For visitors to the exhibit and archives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In accordance with Chapman University’s COVID-19 guidelines, face masks are no longer required to enter the exhibit, but are recommended. Those who are personally at high-risk, or in contact with high-risk individuals, or who are more comfortable wearing a mask should continue to do so.</li>
<li>Total number of visitors inside the exhibit <strong>must not exceed 10 people </strong>at any given time, due to the small exhibit space.</li>
<li>For any group larger than 20 people, they will be divided into smaller groups and will be rotated in and out of the exhibit. The group(s) waiting for their turn may visit the other public areas of the library or campus until it is their tour time.</li>
