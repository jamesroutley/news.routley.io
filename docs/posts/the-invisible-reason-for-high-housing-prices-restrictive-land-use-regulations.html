  <p>It is extremely difficult to build housing in Rhode Island. It’s also expensive to buy homes, with prices having increased by 34% since the summer of 2020. Why? Adam A. Millsap <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2023/05/26/zoning-reforms-not-public-housing-will-fix-rhode-islands-housing-problem/?sh=544bdb4f93cd">makes the case in <em>Forbes</em></a> that because Rhode Island zoning laws are overly restrictive, developers are unable to meet the current and past needs of housing. Millsap writes:</p><p>“Places with fewer land-use regulations and more flexible zoning have lower housing prices and slower rent growth. Land-use regulations such as density restrictions, height restrictions, minimum lot sizes, parking requirements, and complicated set-back rules prevent developers from building more housing, especially more affordable housing.” </p><p>In this episode of <em>Upzoned</em>, join host Abby Kinney as she talks with guest Nolan Gray, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arbitrary-Lines-Zoning-Broke-American/dp/1642832545/%20https://books.apple.com/us/book/arbitrary-lines/id1623268388?ign-itscg=30200&amp;ign%E2%80%A6%20https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/arbitrary-lines-nolan-gray/1140526473?ean=97816%E2%80%A6%20https://bookshop.org/books/arbitrary-lines-how-zoning-broke-the-american-city-an%E2%80%A6%20Arbitrary%20Lines%20How%20Zoning%20Broke%20the%20American%20City%20and%20How%20to%20Fix%20It"><em>Arbitrary Lines</em></a>, about his perspective on zoning laws and Rhode Island’s efforts to address their housing crisis.</p>
