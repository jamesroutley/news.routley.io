    <h1>Debian 13 &#34;Trixie&#34;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">

<p><strong>August 9th, 2025</strong></p>
<p>After 2 years, 1 month, and 30 days of development, the Debian
project is proud to present its new stable version 13 (code name <q>trixie</q>).</p>
<p><q>trixie</q> will be supported for the next 5 years thanks to the
combined work of the <a href="https://security-team.debian.org/">Debian Security team</a>
and the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">Debian Long Term Support</a> team.</p>
<p>Debian 13 <q>trixie</q> ships with several desktop environments, such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Gnome 48,</li>
<li>KDE Plasma 6.3,</li>
<li>LXDE 13,</li>
<li>LXQt 2.1.0,</li>
<li>Xfce 4.20</li>
</ul>
<p>This release contains over <b>14,100</b> new packages for a total count of
<b>69,830</b> packages, while over <b>8,840</b> packages have been removed
as <q>obsolete</q>. <b>44,326</b> packages were updated in this release.
The overall disk usage for <q>trixie</q> is <b>403,854,660 kB (403 GB)</b>, and
is made up of <b>1,463,291,186</b> lines of code.</p>
<p>Thanks to our translators who have made the <b>man</b>-pages for
<q>trixie</q> available in multiple languages.</p><p>
The manpages-l10n project has contributed many improved and new translations
for manual pages. Especially Romanian and Polish translations are greatly
enhanced since bookworm.
All architectures other than i386 now use a 64-bit time_t ABI, supporting dates
beyond 2038.
Debian contributors have made significant progress towards ensuring package
builds produce byte-for-byte reproducible results. You can check the status for
packages installed on your system using the new package debian-repro-status, or
visit <a href="https://reproduce.debian.net/">reproduce.debian.net</a> for
Debian&#39;s overall statistics for trixie and newer.
</p><p>Debian 13 <q>trixie</q> includes numerous updated software packages
(over 63% of all packages from the previous release), such as:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache 2.4.64</li>
<li>Bash 5.2.37</li>
<li>BIND DNS Server 9.20</li>
<li>Cryptsetup 2.7</li>
<li>curl/libcurl 8.14.1</li>

</ul>
<p>
With this broad selection of packages and its traditional wide
architecture support, Debian once again stays true to its goal of being
<q>The Universal Operating System</q>. It is suitable for many different
use cases: from desktop systems to netbooks; from development servers to
cluster systems; and for database, web, and storage servers. At the same
time, additional quality assurance efforts like automatic installation and
upgrade tests for all packages in Debian&#39;s archive ensure that <q>trixie</q>
fulfills the high expectations that users have of a stable Debian release.
</p>
<p>
This release for the first time officially supports the riscv64
architecture, allowing users to run Debian on 64-bit RISC-V hardware and
benefit from all Debian 13 features. A total of seven architectures are officially supported for <q>trixie</q>:
</p>
<ul><q>trixie</q>
<li>64-bit PC (amd64),</li>
<li>64-bit ARM (arm64),</li>
<li>ARM EABI (armel),</li>
<li>ARMv7 (EABI hard-float ABI, armhf),</li>
<li>64-bit little-endian PowerPC (ppc64el),</li>
<li>64-bit little-endian RISC-V (riscv64),</li>
<li>IBM System z (s390x)</li>
</ul>
<p>
i386 is no longer supported as a regular architecture: there is no official
kernel and no Debian installer for i386 systems. The i386 architecture is now
only intended to be used on a 64-bit (amd64) CPU. Users running i386 systems
should not upgrade to trixie. Instead, Debian recommends either reinstalling
them as amd64, where possible, or retiring the hardware.
</p>
<p>
<q>trixie</q> will be the last release for the armel architecture. See <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.html#last-release-for-armel">5.1.3.
Last release for armel</a> in the release notes for more information on our ARM
EABI support.
</p>
<p>The Debian Cloud team publishes <q>trixie</q> for several cloud computing
services:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon EC2 (amd64 and arm64),</li>
<li>Microsoft Azure (amd64),</li>
<li>OpenStack (generic) (amd64, arm64, ppc64el),</li>
<li>PlainVM (amd64, arm64, ppc64el),</li>
<li>NoCloud (amd64, arm64, ppc64el)</li>
</ul>
<p>
The genericcloud image should be able to run in any virtualised environment,
and there is also a nocloud image which is useful for testing the build process.
</p>
<p>Cloud images provide automation hooks via ``cloud-init`` and prioritize
fast instance startup using specifically optimized kernel packages and
grub configurations.
</p>
<h3>Want to give it a try?</h3>
<p>
If you simply want to try Debian 13 <q>trixie</q> without installing it,
you can use one of the available <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/live/">live images</a>
which load and run the complete operating system in a read-only state via your
computer&#39;s memory.
</p>
<p>
These live images are provided for the <code>amd64</code> and
<code>arm64</code> architectures and are available for DVDs, USB sticks,
and netboot setups.
The user can choose among different desktop
environments to try: GNOME, KDE Plasma, Cinnamon, MATE, LXDE, LXQt, and Xfce.
Debian Live <q>trixie</q> has a standard live image, so it is also possible
to try a base Debian system without any of the graphical user interfaces.
</p>
<p>
Should you enjoy the operating system you have the option of installing
from the live image onto your computer&#39;s hard disk. The live image
includes the Calamares independent installer as well as the standard Debian
Installer. More information is available in the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/releasenotes">release notes</a> and the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/live/">live install images</a> sections of the Debian
website.
Multi-architecture Debian <q>trixie</q> container images are also available on
<a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/debian">Docker Hub</a> . In addition to the
standard images, a <q>slim</q> variant is available to reduce disk usage.
The Debian Installer and Debian Live Images can now be booted using
<q>HTTP Boot</q> on supported UEFI and U-Boot firmware.
</p>
<p>
To install Debian 13 <q>trixie</q> directly onto your computer&#39;s storage
device you can choose from a variety of installation media types to
<a href="https://www.debian.org/download">Download</a>
such as: Blu-ray Disc, DVD, CD, USB stick, or via a network connection.
See the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/installmanual">Installation Guide</a>
for more details.
</p>
<p>
Debian can now be installed in 78 languages, with most of them available
in both text-based and graphical user interfaces.
</p>
<p>
The installation images may be downloaded right now via
<a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/torrent-cd/">bittorrent</a> (the recommended method),
<a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/#which">jigdo</a>, or
<a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/">HTTP</a>; see
<a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/">Debian on CDs</a> for further information. <q>trixie</q>
will soon be available on physical DVD, CD-ROM, and Blu-ray Discs from
numerous <a href="https://www.debian.org/CD/vendors">vendors</a> too.
</p>
<h3>Upgrading Debian</h3>
<p>
Upgrades to Debian 13 <q>trixie</q> from the previous release, Debian 12
<q>bookworm</q>, are automatically handled by the APT package
management tool for most configurations.
</p>
<p>Before upgrading your system, it is strongly recommended that you make a
full backup, or at least back up any data or configuration information you
can&#39;t afford to lose. The upgrade tools and process are quite reliable, but
a hardware failure in the middle of an upgrade could result in a severely
damaged system.</p>
<p>The main things you&#39;ll want to back up are the contents of /etc,
/var/lib/dpkg, /var/lib/apt/extended_states and the output of:
</p>
<p><code>$ dpkg --get-selections &#39;*&#39; # (the quotes are important)</code></p><p>We welcome any information from users related to the upgrade from
<q>bookworm</q> to <q>trixie</q>. Please share information by filing a bug in the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/amd64/release-notes/ch-about.en.html#upgrade-reports">Debian
bug tracking system</a> using the <b>upgrade-reports</b> package with your results.
</p>
<p>
There has been a lot of development on the Debian Installer since its previous
official release with Debian 12, resulting in improved hardware support and
some very useful new features such as
</p><ul>
<li>Improved hardware and software support for speech synthesis</li>
<li>Initial and restricted support for rescuing Debian installed to a btrfs subvolume</li>
<li>Changed default unit from MB to GB when partitioning disks</li>
<li>Disabled cdrom sources if installation medium is not a real CD (USB stick, SD card, ISO file), because APT cannot use it after the installation</li>
<li>Plus support for secure boot with systemd-boot</li>
</ul>

<p>It is advisable to remove bookworm-backports entries from APT source-list
files before the upgrade; after the upgrade consider adding <b>trixie-backports</b>.
</p>
<p>
If your APT configuration also involves pinning or <code>APT::Default-Release</code>,
it is likely to require adjustments to allow the upgrade of packages to the new
stable release. Please consider
<a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/upgrading.html#disabling-apt-pinning">disabling APT pinning</a>.
</p>
<p>
Under some circumstances, issues might arise during the upgrade process, or
while running <q>trixie</q>.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the TLS support in the OpenLDAP client <b>libldap2</b> and server <b>slapd</b>
is now provided by OpenSSL instead of GnuTLS. This affects the available
configuration options, as well as their behavior. If no TLS CA
certificates are specified, the system default trust store will now be loaded automatically. If you do not want
the default CAs to be used, you must configure
the trusted CAs explicitly. For more information about LDAP client configuration,
see the <a href="https://manpages.debian.org/trixie/ldap.conf.5">ldap.conf.5</a>
man page.
</p>
<p>
We have documented this and other possible issues at <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.html">5. Issues to be aware
of for trixie</a> in the release notes. You&#39;re advised to read that before upgrading.
</p>
<p>
As always, Debian systems may be upgraded painlessly, in place,
without any forced downtime, but it is strongly recommended to read
the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/releasenotes">release notes</a> as
well as the <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/trixie/installmanual">installation
guide</a> for possible issues, and for detailed instructions on
installing and upgrading. The release notes will be further improved and
translated to additional languages in the weeks after the release.
