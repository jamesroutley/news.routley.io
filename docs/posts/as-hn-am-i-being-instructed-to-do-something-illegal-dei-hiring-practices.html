      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I work in an engineering department at a tech company in the USA. I&#39;ve worked on many hiring projects over the years but the latest project is different to the others.<p>In the spreadsheet that lists all the open positions, there&#39;s a new column next to open positions with DEI comments. It has a line like this:</p><p>Senior Software Engineer (<i>must</i> be female)</p><p>If I follow this spreadsheet and exclude male applicants, then would I break any laws? Or if not laws, then would I violate other regulations or ethical standards in the industry?</p><p>I ask because my understanding of anti-discrimination law is that there are certain classes of people that cannot be excluded from job openings. Things like sex and race.</p><p>If this is illegal then what&#39;s the right way to handle this? Are there other ways I should think about this besides legal/illegal or ethical/unethical? Does region or state within the USA matter?</p><p>A little more context:</p><p>As a SSE I would do interviews or screen candidates but now in a Sr Manager role I&#39;m more involved in the early planning and management of the process. In the first meeting where I saw the comments I said nothing. I followed up a few days later with an email to VP eng to say I opposed. 2 days after that I had a call with VP eng where I raised the issue again and they insisted that the requirement remain. I&#39;ve taken no more action after that.</p></td></tr>
