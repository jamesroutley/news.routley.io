<p>Reddit is getting ready to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/reddits-api-pricing-results-in-shocking-20-million-a-year-bill-for-apollo/">slap third-party apps</a> with millions of dollars in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/">API fees</a>, and many Reddit users are unhappy about it. A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/">widespread protest</a> is planned for June 12, with hundreds of subreddits planning to go dark for 48 hours.</p>
<p>Reddit started life as a geeky site, but as it has aged, it has been trying to work more like a traditional social network. Part of that push included the development of a first-party app for mobile devices, but the 17-year-old site <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/04/07/reddit-launches-its-first-official-apps-for-ios-and-android/">only launched</a> an official app in 2016. Before then, it was up to third-party apps to pick up the slack, and even now, the revenue-focused official app is <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13zq2ki/reddit_official_app_fucking_sucks_lmao/">generally considered</a> inferior to third-party options.</p>
<p>Reasonable API pricing would not necessarily mean the death of third-party apps, but the pricing Reddit communicated to some of its biggest developers is far above what other sites charge. The popular iOS client Apollo announced it was facing a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/reddits-api-pricing-results-in-shocking-20-million-a-year-bill-for-apollo/">$20 million-a-year</a> bill. Apollo&#39;s developer, Christian Selig, hasn&#39;t announced a shutdown but admitted, &#34;I don&#39;t have that kind of money or would even know how to charge it to a credit card.&#34;</p>
<p>Other third-party apps are in the same boat. The developer of Reddit is Fun has said the API costs will &#34;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/">likely kill</a>&#34; the app. Narwhal, another third-party app, will be &#34;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/">dead in 30 days</a>&#34; when the pricing kicks in on July 1, according to its developer.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Selig broke the news of the new pricing scheme, saying, &#34;I don&#39;t see how this pricing is anything based in reality or remotely reasonable.&#34; Selig said Reddit wants to charge $12,000 for 50 million requests, while Imgur, an image-focused site that&#39;s similar to Reddit, charges $166 for 50 million API calls. A <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh2te/what_we_want/">post pinned to the top of the new /r/Save3rdPartyApps subreddit</a> calls for a pricing decrease &#34;by a factor of 15 to 20,&#34; saying that would &#34;put API calls in territory more closely comparable to other sites, like Imgur.&#34;</p>
<p>Reddit is Fun (RIF) developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/">/u/talklittle</a> said Reddit&#39;s API terms also require &#34;blocking ads in third-party apps, which make up the majority of RIF&#39;s revenue.&#34; Talklittle says the pricing and ad restriction will &#34;force a paid subscription model&#34; onto any surviving apps. Reddit&#39;s APIs also exclude adult content, a major draw for the site.</p>
<p>While Reddit is a company that makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year, the content moderation and community building is all done by volunteer moderators. This means that you get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/07/reddit-revolts-after-site-lays-off-ask-me-anything-employee/">fun civil wars</a>, where the users and mods can take up arms against the site administrators. The <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/">full list</a> of subreddits participating in the June 12 shutdown is currently over a thousand subreddits strong. Many of the site&#39;s most popular subreddits, like r/gaming, r/Music, and r/Pics, are participating, and each has over 30 million subscribers. The Reddit administrators have yet to respond.</p>
