  <p>(some writing without hesitation or editing. possibly with repetition and deviation.)</p>

<p>The classic reinforcement technique is carrot and stick.</p>

<p>Pure stick tends to breed resentment and laziness. Pure carrot breeds similarly, since you’re not <em>doing</em> anything.</p>

<p>There’s a divine carrot too: doing things because they are sacred to you. They are worthwhile.</p>

<p>Go work in the desert and at night, dance around on drugs and feel sacred things.</p>

<p>Pull your actions into the world. All of the world, including the strange bits of experience that spark curiosity.</p>

<p>Enough of that and the stick can fade. Genuine curiosity can take its place. Even if each moment does not spark that curiosity, a genuine desire to see the end point because you’ve never seen it before can.</p>

<p>Over a long enough timeline, even punishments lose their sting as long as they can be survived.</p>

<p>Rewards lose their luster as one acclimates.</p>

<p>Overdoing the desert strategy isn’t much better, since it pulls the unusual too far into ordinary experience, and diminishes the sense of awe that drives one in the first place.</p>
