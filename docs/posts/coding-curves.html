    <h1>Coding Curves</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>



<p>For a number of years, I’ve been wanting to writing a book called “Coding Curves”. There are all kinds of really fascinating curves that are fun to code and understand and create very interesting images. I’ve started this book at least three times. I’m feeling the urge to to it again, but I’m going to be more realistic about it this time. I don’t think I’m going to sit down and write a book cover to cover and get it formatted and edited and self publish it. I’ve accepted that that’s just not going to happen. But I want to write about this stuff.</p>



<h2>The Plan</h2>



<p>So I’m going to try to do it as a series of blog posts. I don’t know how often these posts will come out. Maybe once a week if I’m diligent. Maybe more often if I get on a roll. Maybe less if I get bored, distracted, or busy with other things. But even if there’s a gap, I can pick back up where I left off and continue.</p>



<p>Maybe, when it’s all done (will it ever be?) there will be enough there to actually compile into a book. Who knows.</p>



<h2>Table of Contents</h2>



<p>This is the plan. It may differ, but we gotta start somewhere. I’ll link the posts as they come out here, so this post can continue to serve as an index.</p>

<p>In general we’ll be covering two-dimensional curves. Some of these subjects will take multiple posts to cover. I’ll update the TOC as it evolves. There may be more subjects too, and I’m open to suggestions.</p>



<h2>The Format</h2>



<p>Most of what I’ve written before has been tailored to a specific language. For example, I wrote <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.playingwithchaos.net/" target="_blank">Playing With Chaos</a> using JavaScript and HTML 5 Canvas. The idea was that it should be generic enough to convert to any language or platform, but I felt I needed to base it in some concrete language.</p>



<p>After recently reading a couple of really fantastic books on ray tracing (<a href="https://www.bit-101.com/blog/2022/10/my-raytracing-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered here</a>), which were completely language agnostic and only included pseudocode samples, I’ve changed my thinking about this. So all “code samples” in this series will actually be “pseudocode samples”.</p>



<p>So write in whatever language or platform you want. The main requirements will be:</p>



<p>A. The ability to set up and size a canvas or drawing surface of some kind.</p>



<p>B. The ability to draw lines of different colors and widths on said canvas.</p>



<p>C. Typical language features and control structures like functions, variables, for loops, conditionals, etc. We’ll probably need some kind of array or list as well as some structured object type, so we can have a <code>point</code> object that has <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> properties. Most of this is all table stakes for any modern language, though it may look different in each one.</p>



<p>Additionally, it will be nice if you can draw circles (or at least arcs, which can become circles) and rectangles, and be able to fill an area with a given color. Extra credit if your drawing api lets you write text to the canvas.</p>



<p>A simple pseudocode example might look like this:</p>


<div><pre title="">canvas(800, 800)

setLineWidth(5)
setColor(1, 0, 0) // red
moveTo(100, 100)
lineTo(700, 700)
stroke()
</pre></div>


<p>This should output an image like this:</p>

<p>I’ll avoid going as deep as OOP or FP as those can look quite different on different platforms, but we’ll need some functions, so I’ll keep those pretty basic:</p>


<div><pre title="">canvas(500, 100)
foo(100)

function foo(count) {
  for (i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    moveTo(i * 10, 10)
    lineTo(i * 10, 90)
  }
  stroke()
}
</pre></div>


<p>Resulting in:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="100" src="https://www.bit-101.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/out-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.bit-101.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/out-1.png 500w, https://www.bit-101.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/out-1-300x60.png 300w, https://www.bit-101.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/out-1-400x80.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"/></figure>



<p>A few things to note here. </p>



<p>First, I’m calling the function before it’s defined. That might work in your language, or it might not. If not, you’ll have to rearrange things.</p>



<p>Secondly, the drawing api functions are written like global functions. It’s likely that in your drawing api, these will need to be called as methods of some kind of canvas object, which may have to be passed into the function, or might be able to be defined globally. I’m going to ignore that and assume that you can figure stuff like that out. The focus here is on covering concepts, not best coding practices.</p>



<p>Also, I’m not bother with types for vars, args or returns, unless in some instance it becomes non-obvious and important.</p>



<p>As I get deeper into the series, my pseudocode style might change somewhat. If so, I’ll come back here and update things.</p>



<h2>Wait for it!</h2>



<p>Look for the first installment soon!</p>
