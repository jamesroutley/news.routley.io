	<p>When people turn data into <span>HTML</span> tables using JavaScript, they either use the <span>DOM</span> methods (createElement() and the likes), but most of the time just append a huge string and use innerHTML, which always is a security concern. However, did you know that <span>HTML</span> tables also have an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLTableElement" title="">old, forgotten <span>API</span></a> ? Using this one, you can loop over tables, create bodies, rows, cells, heads, footers, captions an summaries (yes, <span>HTML</span> tables have all of those) and access the table cells. Without having to re-render the whole table on each change. Check out the <a href="https://codepen.io/codepo8/pen/RNrVPzq?editors=1111" title="">Codepen</a> to see how you can create a table from a nested array:</p>

	<div><div><pre>let table <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>[</span><span>&#39;one&#39;</span><span>,</span><span>&#39;two&#39;</span><span>,</span><span>&#39;three&#39;</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
  <span>[</span><span>&#39;four&#39;</span><span>,</span><span>&#39;five&#39;</span><span>,</span><span>&#39;six&#39;</span><span>]</span>
<span>]</span><span>;</span>
let b <span>=</span> document.<span>body</span><span>;</span>
let t <span>=</span> document.<span>createElement</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;table&#39;</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
b.<span>appendChild</span><span>(</span>t<span>)</span><span>;</span>
table.<span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>row<span>,</span>ri<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  let r <span>=</span> t.<span>insertRow</span><span>(</span>ri<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  row.<span>forEach</span><span>(</span><span>(</span>l<span>,</span>i<span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    let c <span>=</span> r.<span>insertCell</span><span>(</span>i<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    c.<span>innerText</span> <span>=</span> l<span>;</span>  
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>




	<p>You can then access each table cell with an index (with t being a reference to the table):</p>

	<div><div><pre>console.<span>log</span><span>(</span>t.<span>rows</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span>.<span>cells</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>]</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>// =&gt; &lt;td&gt;five&lt;/td&gt;</span></pre></div></div>




	<p>You can also delete and create cells and rows, if you want to add a row to the end of the table with a cell, all you need to do is:</p>

	<div><div><pre>t.<span>insertRow</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
t.<span>rows</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>.<span>insertCell</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
t.<span>rows</span><span>[</span><span>2</span><span>]</span>.<span>cells</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>]</span>.<span>innerText</span> <span>=</span> <span>&#39;foo&#39;</span><span>;</span></pre></div></div>




	<p>There are a few things here that are odd – adding a -1 to add a row at the end for example – and there seems to be no way to create a TH element instead of a TD. All table cells are just cells.</p>

	<p>However, seeing how much of a pain it is to create tables, it would be fun to re-visit this <span>API</span> and add more functionality to it. We did add a lot of things to <span>HTML</span> forms, like formData and the change event, so why not add events and other features to tables. That way they’d finally get the status as data structures and not a hack to layout content on the web.</p>
