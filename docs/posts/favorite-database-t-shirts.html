    <h1>Favorite Database T-Shirts</h1>

            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I like wearing database shirts. MongoDB&#39;s original shirt from the early 2010s is the vanguard. You should never opt for a cheaper material.
</li></ul>

<p>When I was an undergrad, I was really into shirts from obscure indie and punk bands (see <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&#39;/outgoing/52colony.com&#39;);" href="http://52colony.com/modules5862.html">example #1</a><sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup> and <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&#39;/outgoing/52colony.com&#39;);" href="http://52colony.com/modules3171.html">example #2</a><sup><a href="#footnote2">[2]</a></sup> from 2004). It was my (pretentious) way of trying to be different by wearing shirts from bands that broke up after only one album<sup><a href="#footnote3">[3]</a></sup>. I&#39;m older now and I don&#39;t run basement shows anymore. So now that same zeal that I had back then for band shirts is now channeled towards database shirts. I now wear shirts from database companies that broke up and no longer exist (e.g., <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&#39;/outgoing/www.bizjournals.com&#39;);" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/startups/2013/07/akiban-acquired-by-foundationdb-with.html">Akiban</a>, <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&#39;/outgoing/en.wikipedia.org&#39;);" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeround">Xeround</a>).</p>
<p>Promoting your database system or start-up with a shirt is almost as important as getting the thing to actually run. As I&#39;ve told my students several times, in the world of databases you <em>don&#39;t sell the steak, you sell the sizzle</em>. Over the years, I&#39;ve collected a number of shirts from database companies (mostly newer NoSQL and NewSQL start-ups). A good shirt can get people to feel like your DBMS is going to solve all of their application&#39;s database problems. Of course this means you have to have good branding and logo design. But all of these efforts should be in the name of working towards the goal of making an impressive shirt that people will want to wear and promote your system.</p>
<p>In this article, I provide a list of my top five favorite database shirts. I have other ones that I like a lot (and ones that I think are dreadful<sup><a href="#footnote4">[4]</a></sup>), but the shirts listed below are the ones that feel are a step above the others. Eventually we will conduct a more scientific evaluation of these systems, but I thought that it would be fun to compare them based on their shirts. I evaluate the shirts based on the following metrics: </p>
<ol>
<li><b>Material Quality:</b> How soft and thick is the shirt? Does it feel sturdy and a high quality?</li>
<li><b>Fit:</b> How well does the shirt fit on someone with a normal body shape?</li>
<li><b>Design:</b> Is the artwork on the shirt interesting and something that one could wear in public?</li>
</ol>
<!-- For some companies, I have more than one shirt. I also have two zip-up hoodies. Each of these will be evaluated separately at some point. I also  -->
<p>Per Margo Seltzer&#39;s <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview(&#39;/outgoing/mis-misinformation.blogspot.com&#39;);" href="http://mis-misinformation.blogspot.com/2012/10/gender-and-swag.html">guidelines</a>, extra points are given to companies that provide a women&#39;s cut shirt.</p>
<p>I recognize that companies typically make nicer items for their employees (e.g., MemSQL has Patagonia jackets). The shirts in this review are only ones that the companies give out to non-employees (e.g., customers, professors). </p>
