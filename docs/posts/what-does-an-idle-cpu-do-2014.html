    <h1>What does an idle CPU do? (2014)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>In the <a href="https://manybutfinite.com/post/when-does-your-os-run">last post</a> I said the fundamental axiom of OS behavior is that <em>at any
given time</em>, exactly <strong>one and only one task is active</strong> on a CPU.  But if
there’s absolutely nothing to do, then what?</p>
<p>It turns out that this situation is extremely common, and for most personal
computers it’s actually the norm: an ocean of sleeping processes, all waiting on
some condition to wake up, while nearly 100% of CPU time is going into the
mythical “idle task.” In fact, if the CPU is consistently busy for a normal
user, it’s often a misconfiguration, bug, or malware.</p>
<p>Since we can’t violate our axiom, <em>some task needs to be active</em> on a CPU.
First because it’s good design: it would be unwise to spread special cases all
over the kernel checking whether there <em>is</em> in fact an active task. A design is
far better when there are <em>no exceptions</em>. Whenever you write an <code>if</code> statement,
Nyan Cat cries. And second, we need to do <em>something</em> with all those idle CPUs,
lest they get spunky and, you know, create Skynet.</p>
<p>So to keep design consistency and be one step ahead of the devil, OS developers
create an <strong>idle task</strong> that gets scheduled to run when there’s no other work.
We have seen in the Linux <a href="https://manybutfinite.com/post/kernel-boot-process">boot process</a> that the idle task is process 0,
a direct descendent of the very first instruction that runs when a computer is
first turned on. It is initialized in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.17/init/main.c#L393" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rest_init</a>, where <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.17/kernel/sched/core.c#L4538" target="_blank" rel="noopener">init_idle_bootup_task</a>
initializes the idle <strong>scheduling class</strong>.</p>
<p>Briefly, Linux supports different scheduling classes for things like real-time
processes, regular user processes, and so on. When it’s time to choose a process
to become the active task, these classes are queried in order of priority. That
way, the nuclear reactor control code always gets to run before the web browser.
Often, though, these classes return <code>NULL</code>, meaning they don’t have a suitable
process to run - they’re all sleeping. But the idle scheduling class, which runs
last, never fails: it always returns the idle task.</p>
<p>That’s all good, but let’s get down to just <em>what exactly</em> this idle task is
doing. So here is <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.17/kernel/sched/idle.c#L183" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cpu_idle_loop</a>, courtesy of open source:</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>cpu_idle_loop</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span>while</span> (<span>1</span>) {</span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p>I’ve omitted many details, and we’ll look at task switching closely later on,
but if you read the code you’ll get the gist of it: as long as there’s no need
to reschedule, meaning change the active task, stay idle. Measured in elapsed
time, this loop and its cousins in other OSes are probably the most executed
pieces of code in computing history.  For Intel processors, staying idle
traditionally meant running the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.17/arch/x86/include/asm/irqflags.h#L52" target="_blank" rel="noopener">halt</a> instruction:</p>
<figure><figcaption><span>native_halt</span></figcaption><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1</span></pre></td><td><pre><span><span><span>static</span> <span>inline</span> <span>void</span> <span>native_halt</span><span>(<span>void</span>)</span></span></span></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
<p><code>hlt</code> stops code execution in the processor and puts it in a halted state. It’s
weird to think that across the world millions and millions of Intel-like CPUs
are spending the majority of their time halted, even while they’re powered up.
It’s also not terribly efficient, energy wise, which led chip makers to develop
deeper sleep states for processors, which trade off less power consumption for
longer wake-up latency. The kernel’s <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/384146/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cpuidle subsystem</a> is
responsible for taking advantage of these power-saving modes.</p>
<p>Now once we tell the CPU to halt, or sleep, we need to somehow bring it back to
life. If you’ve read the <a href="https://manybutfinite.com/post/when-does-your-os-run">last post</a>, you might suspect <em>interrupts</em> are
involved, and indeed they are.  Interrupts spur the CPU out of its halted state
and back into action. So putting this all together, here’s what your system
mostly does as you read a fully rendered web page:</p>
<p><img id="idle" src="https://manybutfinite.com/img/os/idle.png" usemap="#mapidle"/></p><map id="mapidle" name="mapidle">
<area shape="poly" coords="110,6,110,96,20,96,20,6" href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.17/kernel/sched/idle.c#L183"/>
<area shape="poly" coords="593,6,593,96,503,96,503,6" href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.17/kernel/time/tick-common.c#L78"/>
<area shape="poly" coords="754,6,754,96,664,96,664,6" href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.17/kernel/sched/idle.c#L183"/>
</map>
<p>Other interrupts besides the timer interrupt also get the processor moving
again. That’s what happens if you click on a web page, for example: your mouse
issues an interrupt, its driver processes it, and suddenly a process is runnable
because it has fresh input. At that point <code>need_resched()</code> returns true, and the
idle task is booted out in favor of your browser.</p>
<p>But let’s stick to idleness in this post. Here’s the idle loop over time:</p>
<p><img id="idleCycles" src="https://manybutfinite.com/img/os/idleCycles.png"/></p><p>In this example the timer interrupt was programmed by the kernel to happen every
4 milliseconds (ms). This is the <em>tick period</em>. That means we get 250 ticks per
second, so the <em>tick rate</em> or <em>tick frequency</em> is 250 Hz. That’s a typical value
for Linux running on Intel processors, with 100 Hz being another crowd favorite.
This is defined in the <code>CONFIG_HZ</code> option when you build the kernel.</p>
<p>Now that looks like an awful lot of pointless work for an <em>idle CPU</em>, and it is.
Without fresh input from the outside world, the CPU will remain stuck in this
hellish nap getting woken up 250 times a second while your laptop battery is
drained.  If this is running in a virtual machine, we’re burning both power and
valuable cycles from the host CPU.</p>
<p>The solution here is to have a <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.17/Documentation/timers/NO_HZ.txt#L17" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dynamic tick</a> so that when the CPU is idle, the
timer interrupt is either <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.17/Documentation/timers/highres.txt#L215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deactivated or reprogrammed</a> to
happen at a point where the kernel <em>knows</em> there will be work to do (for
example, a process might have a timer expiring in 5 seconds, so we must not
sleep past that). This is also called <em>tickless mode</em>.</p>
<p>Finally, suppose you have <em>one active process</em> in a system, for example
a long-running CPU-intensive task. That’s nearly identical to an idle system:
these diagrams remain about the same, just substitute the one process for the
idle task and the pictures are accurate. In that case it’s still pointless to
interrupt the task every 4 ms for no good reason: it’s merely OS jitter slowing
your work ever so slightly. Linux can also stop the fixed-rate tick in this
one-process scenario, in what’s called <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v3.17/Documentation/timers/NO_HZ.txt#L100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adaptive-tick</a> mode. Eventually,
a fixed-rate tick may be gone <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/549580/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">altogether</a>.</p>
<p>That’s enough idleness for one post. The kernel’s idle behavior is an important
part of the OS puzzle, and it’s very similar to other situations we’ll see, so
this helps us build the picture of a running kernel. More next week, <a href="https://manybutfinite.com/feed.xml">RSS</a> and
