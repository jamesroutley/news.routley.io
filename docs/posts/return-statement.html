    <h1>Return Statement</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Long story short, my batch at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> at the beginning of
this year constituted the best 3 months of my life.</p>

<p>For the first 20-some years of my life, there was always a logical next step, something to work toward.
There were activities that I enjoyed, but ultimately my day to day was structured around reaching the next milestone.</p>

<p>My time at RC has helped me embrace the day-to-day and find joy in creating software.
Instead of using my career as a means to an end, my new high-level goal is to use my career as a means to learn, grow and
build valuable tools for myself and others.</p>

<p>RC encourages you to introspect and find intrinsic motivation, while fostering an inquisitive, supportive community.</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more I could write; and I plan to include much of that in future posts. But I&#39;ve procrastinated long enough writing this post. RC was a life-changing experience and I would recommend it to anyone who can find the time.</p>
