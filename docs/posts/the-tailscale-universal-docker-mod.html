    <h1>The Tailscale Universal Docker Mod</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Imagine a world where you could add applications to your tailnet the same way you add machines to it. This would mean that <code>http://wiki</code> would go to your internal wiki, <code>http://code</code> would take you to an IDE, and <code>http://chat</code> would take you to your internal chat server. This is the world that Tailscale lets you create, but historically the details on how you would actually do this are left as an exercise for the reader.</p><p>Today, we&#39;re introducing a new way to add Tailscale to your Docker containers: our brand new <a href="https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">universal Docker mod</a>. This lets you add Tailscale to any Docker container based on <a href="https://linuxserver.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">linuxserver.io</a> images. This lets you have applications join your tailnet just as easily as machines can. You can set up a wiki on <code>http://wiki</code>, an IDE at <code>http://code</code>, and a chat server at <code>http://chat</code> and have them all be accessible over your tailnet. You can even use this to expose your internal applications to the public internet with <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1112/funnel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Funnel</a>.</p><div><p><img alt="the avatar for Xe Iaso" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p>&lt;<b>Xe</b>&gt; </p><p>You can even use this to SSH into containers!</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="A picture of the character Aoi in a coffee mood.}" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fxe%2Fstickers%2Faoi%2Fcoffee.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fxe%2Fstickers%2Faoi%2Fcoffee.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fxe%2Fstickers%2Faoi%2Fcoffee.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/><br/></p><div><p>&lt;<b>Aoi</b>&gt; </p><p>You can <em>what</em> into a container?</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="the avatar for Xe Iaso" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p>&lt;<b>Xe</b>&gt; </p><p>Yep! <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/ssh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tailscale SSH</a> lets you SSH into containers when you enable the <code>TAILSCALE_USE_SSH</code> setting and <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1193/tailscale-ssh/#ensure-tailscale-ssh-is-permitted-in-acls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">permit access in the ACLs</a>. This is a great way to get into a container without having to SSH into the docker host and run <code>docker exec -it &lt;container&gt; bash</code>.</p></div></div><p>To add this to your existing Docker containers with linuxserver.io images, add the following environment variables to your docker-compose.yml file:</p><p>This will add Tailscale to your container so that you can access it over your tailnet.

When you consume the same Docker image at two time intervals T0 and T1, you get the same image with the same code, just as you expect.</p><p>When a Docker container is run, it usually runs on top of an ephemeral filesystem that gets destroyed when the container is stopped. This means that restarting the container will reset it back to the state that was there when the image was created. This is normally convenient when working on applications that make temporary changes to the filesystem, such as an image converter that uses temporary files to do the conversion logic.</p><p>This is less convenient when you want to run things like database servers in Docker. However, most of the time when you do things that need persistent state, that persistent state is usually limited to a single file or directory. Docker provides external persistent state with <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">volumes</a>. They&#39;re basically directories that are plunked into the container at runtime, but it maintains the state between container runs. This is great for things like databases because you wouldn&#39;t want to lose all your data when you restart the container.</p><p><img alt="The expected hierarchies of Docker containers and their statefulness" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/images/universal-docker-mod/docker-normal.svg" width="623" height="490" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><p>So, from here we can create a hierarchy for docker and statefulness. You expect docker containers to have state for <em>data</em>, and you also expect the docker container to be running the same code every time you run the same image. You don&#39;t expect anything else to be running, everything is deterministic at T0, T1, or TN.</p><div><p><img alt="the avatar for Xe Iaso" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p>&lt;<b>Xe</b>&gt; </p><p>This is a valid hierarchy because it&#39;s what you expect from docker. You expect the same code to run every time you run the same image.</p></div></div><h3 id="what-is-humor"><a href="#what-is-humor" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span></span></a>What is humor?</h3><p>Humor is a complicated concept that is almost universal throughout human cultures. It&#39;s a way of conveying concepts like absurdity, irony, the absurdity of irony, and normally frustrating things in ways that aren&#39;t quite as much of a downer. It&#39;s really about being able to communicate subtle things like common errors that everyone makes when learning things (such as English and its rule of all the rules having exceptions, even for the exceptions). It&#39;s also a tool that you can use to help describe the abstract and nonphysical things like emotions, feelings, ideas, the human condition, and how Kubernetes works.</p><div><p><img alt="the avatar for Xe Iaso" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p>&lt;<b>Xe</b>&gt; </p><p>Humor is also really hard to convey properly in a written medium. This is even more difficult when the humor is about technology, which is usually hard to understand in the first place. I&#39;m going to try to explain the humor in this article with these asides so that y&#39;all can follow along, but if you already get why this is funny it may ruin the joke for you. Sorry!</p></div></div><p>In his famous presentation <a href="https://youtu.be/ar9WRwCiSr0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reverse emulating the NES</a>, fellow philosopher in arms <a href="http://tom7.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tom7</a> introduced the idea of a type of humor called &#34;invalid hierarchies&#34;. In this he does rather abusrd things to an NES using a custom circuit board and a raspbery pi to allow him to (among other things) run an SNES emulator on the NES. This video is quite possibly one of my favorite technical communication videos and is a huge influence to how I write humorous things for this blog.</p><div><p><img alt="the avatar for Xe Iaso" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p>&lt;<b>Xe</b>&gt; </p><p>This creates an invalid hierarchy because you expect the NES to only run 8-bit NES games, but not 16-bit SNES games. This is funny. If you&#39;ve never seen that video before, it&#39;s well worth a watch.</p></div></div><p><img alt="The expected hierarchies of NES and SNES consoles and their games" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/images/universal-docker-mod/nes-snes.svg" width="359" height="490" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><h3 id="docker-mods"><a href="#docker-mods" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span></span></a>Docker mods</h3><p>Docker mods let you install extra packages and services into containers at runtime. If the <code>ONBUILD</code> hook lets you run a series of commands when an image is built, you can think of docker mods as a missing <code>ONRUN</code> hook that lets you customize an image at runtime.</p><p><img alt="How Docker mods change the statefulness of a container" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/images/universal-docker-mod/docker-mod.svg" width="703" height="716" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p><img alt="the avatar for Xe Iaso" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p>&lt;<b>Xe</b>&gt; </p><p>This creates an invalid hierarchy because we think about the code in a container being deterministic between invocations and this allows you to make something <em>nondeterministic</em>. This is funny.</p></div></div><h3 id="docker-mods-and-s6"><a href="#docker-mods-and-s6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span></span></a>Docker mods and s6</h3><p>At a high level, a docker mod is a series of files that add additional instructions to the start phase of a docker container. It works because the <a href="https://www.linuxserver.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">linuxserver.io</a> containers preinstall <a href="https://skarnet.org/software/s6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">s6</a> via <a href="https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">s6-overlay</a> and then start it in the background to manage the lifecycle of services in the container.</p><div><p><img alt="the avatar for Xe Iaso" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p>&lt;<b>Xe</b>&gt; </p><p>This is also funny because usually Docker containers aren&#39;t supposed to have multiple processes running in them for simplicity, but it turns out that when you want to do things like put your wiki seamlessly on your tailnet, you want to have multiple processes running. This is another invalid hierarchy because you expect the container to only have one process running, but it has multiple with a service manager, just like the host OS.</p></div></div><p>When I made the docker mod, I had to create a few s6 services to help it run:</p><ul><li>One to set a list of packages that Tailscale needs to run (<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">jq</a> to process some data from the packages server, and <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iptables</a> to configure the firewall inside the container for Tailscale to run in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TUN</a> device).</li><li>One to download Tailscale to the container.</li><li>One to start the Tailscale node agent <code>tailscaled</code>.</li><li>One to authenticate you to the tailnet with <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1241/tailscale-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>tailscale up</code></a> and set other settings like <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1242/tailscale-serve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>tailscale serve</code></a>.</li></ul><div><p><img alt="the avatar for Xe Iaso" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p>&lt;<b>Xe</b>&gt; </p><p>This is also hilarious because this roughly mirrors the process that you have to do on your host OS to get Tailscale running. This is another layer of invalid hierarchy because you expect containers to ship with all the software they need, but here is this container that needs to download software at runtime. This is funny because it&#39;s like a container that needs to download software at runtime, just like your host OS. As above, so below, eh?</p></div></div><p>Each of these is connected together like this (arrows indicate dependencies):</p><p><img alt="The s6 dependency web" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/images/universal-docker-mod/s6.svg" width="318" height="550" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p><img alt="the avatar for Xe Iaso" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p>&lt;<b>Xe</b>&gt; </p><p>If you&#39;ve ever worked deeply with the Heroku ecosystem, you can think about Docker mods as akin to all of the hilarous hacks you can do with buildpacks at dyno boot time.</p></div></div><h2 id="configuration"><a href="#configuration" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span></span></a>Configuration</h2><p>The Docker mod exposes a bunch of environment variables that you can use to configure it. You can see the full list of environment variables in the <a href="https://github.com/tailscale-dev/docker-mod" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">documentation</a>, but here are the important ones:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Environment Variable</th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>DOCKER_MODS</code></td><td>The list of additional mods to layer on top of the running container, separated by pipes.</td><td><code>ghcr.io/tailscale-dev/docker-mod:main</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>TAILSCALE_STATE_DIR</code></td><td>The directory where the Tailscale state will be stored, this should be pointed to a Docker volume. If it is not, then the node will set itself as ephemeral, making the node disappear from your tailnet when the container exits.</td><td><code>/var/lib/tailscale</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>TAILSCALE_AUTHKEY</code></td><td>The authkey for your tailnet. You can create one in the <a href="https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">admin panel</a>. See <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/auth-keys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> for more information about authkeys and what you can do with them.</td><td><code>tskey-auth-hunter2CNTRL-hunter2hunter2</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>TAILSCALE_HOSTNAME</code></td><td>The hostname that you want to set for the container. If you don&#39;t set this, the hostname of the node on your tailnet will be a bunch of random hexadecimal numbers, which many humans find hard to remember.</td><td><code>wiki</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>TAILSCALE_USE_SSH</code></td><td>Set this to <code>1</code> to enable SSH access to the container.</td><td><code>1</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>TAILSCALE_SERVE_PORT</code></td><td>The port number that you want to expose on your tailnet. This will be the port of your DokuWiki, Transmission, or other container.</td><td><code>80</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>TAILSCALE_SERVE_MODE</code></td><td>The mode you want to run Tailscale serving in. This should be <code>https</code> in most cases, but there may be times when you need to enable <code>tls-terminated-tcp</code> to deal with some weird edge cases like HTTP long-poll connections. See <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1242/tailscale-serve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a> for more information.</td><td><code>https</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>TAILSCALE_FUNNEL</code></td><td>Set this to <code>true</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>t</code> to enable <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1243/funnel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">funnel</a>.

Here is how to do that with the docker commandline:</p><p>Then you can mount it into a container by using the volume name instead of a host path:</p><p>If you want to use kernel networking mode, you will need to add the <code>NET_ADMIN</code> and <code>NET_RAW</code> capabilities to the container, as well as pass the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/tuntap.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><code>/dev/net/tun</code></a> device into the container. Here is an example of how to do that with the docker commandline:</p><p>In a <code>compose.yaml</code> file, it will look like this:</p><p>This can be useful when you are running applications on your tailnet <em>without</em> <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1242/tailscale-serve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">tailscale serve</a>, and you want the underlying service to know the exact remote IP address (such as when running a Minecraft server).</p><h2 id="fun-things-you-can-do"><a href="#fun-things-you-can-do" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span></span></a>Fun things you can do</h2><p>Normally when I write these articles, I tend to give you one functional example so that you can fill in the blanks here. This time, I want to give you a few functional and genuninely useful examples so that you can get started with our Docker mod right away.</p><p>If you want to test this with a simple command-line shell, you can run this docker command to create a volume for Tailscale state, and then run a container with the Docker mod installed:</p> <div><p><img alt="the avatar for Xe Iaso" srcset="/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=64&amp;q=75 1x, /_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://vaibhavsagar.com/_next/image?url=%2Favatars%2Fxe.png&amp;w=128&amp;q=75" width="64" height="64" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"/></p><div><p>&lt;<b>Xe</b>&gt; </p><p><code>trap-sun</code> is the name of the container that we will be running.
