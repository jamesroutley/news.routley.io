    <h1>Google to turn on activity tracking for many users who turned it off</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I received an email from Google yesterday that communicated, with much obfuscation, the following key points:<p>- The “Web &amp; App Activity” setting for Google Workspace users will be ignored by Gmail, Drive, Docs, Calendar, Chat, Meet, Keep, and several other services.</p><p>- Tracking for these services will be controlled by a new user setting, “Google Workspace Search History”, which will default to on regardless of the user’s Web &amp; App Activity setting.</p><p>- The ability of Google Workspace organizations to turn off “Web &amp; App Activity” for all users will be removed.</p><p>- These changes will take effect on 2022-03-29.</p><p>Full email text: https://pastebin.com/raw/5ayJTDDp</p><p>More info from Google: https://support.google.com/a/answer/11194328</p></td></div></div>
