Like, years? As it happens, I had to face facts when I got serious about overhauling my Emacs config. My Emacs 26 was three major versions behind. But underneath lurked my OS, at the fag end of its LTS support window. So <em>of course</em>, the OS <em>had</em> to be upgraded first. Two major LTS version upgrades later I had to let it rest. Then I fell into writing my <a href="https://github.com/adityaathalye/shite">site-maker</a>, because otherwise how would I blog about reduxing my dotemacs?</p><p>Meanwhile, desire to actually redux my config waned.</p><p>Now it waxes eloquent.</p><p>Plus, I am in-batch at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">the Recurse Center</a>, as I type this.
