    <h1>Open-Source Is Just That</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>As someone who has been known to write open-source software and contribute to open-source projects, I have some thoughts on the matter. Particularly, the growing sense of entitlement among users.</p>
<p>When software is open-source, it means it is open-source – that the source is open – nothing more. This simple fact is frequently misunderstood, so let me be crystal clear about what open-source does <em>not</em> automatically mean by default:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does not mean open to contributions;</li>
<li>It does not mean support is offered;</li>
<li>It does not mean you’re entitled to feature requests;</li>
<li>It does not mean the developer owes you their time;</li>
<li>It does not mean you’re entitled to anything;</li>
<li>It does not mean it is <em>free</em> and open-source (FOSS).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some open-source projects choose to offer these things, but they should not be expected. It is up to the discretion of the project and maintainers. Being provided the software at all is a privilege, <em>not</em> a right – anything further doubly so. <sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>When software is open-source, it is open-source, not necessarily free and open-source (FOSS), and even if it is FOSS, it might still have a restrictive licence. <sup><a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#footnote-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> The code being available in and of itself <em>does not</em> give you a right to take it, modify it, or redistribute it.</p>
<h2 id="abuse-of-devs">Abuse of Devs</h2>
<p>I can’t count the amount of times I’ve seen entitled script kiddies spam issues on GitHub or flood a chatroom begging for support on a project run by a volunteer who is fresh out of money, running on caffeine fumes, and yet is working out of love for their common man in the pursuit of improving the world – even if just by a little.</p>
<p>What makes this particularly egregious is that these very much entitled people believe it their right to receive this support and will become combative about it when confronted. It sickens me to see people do this – to verbally abuse the very developers who created the tools they’re using freely.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a concerning number of people who side with the script kiddies on this, stating that “maintainers shouldn’t have started or released their project if they didn’t want to provide support” or that “project maintainers just need a thicker skin”. What a <em>disgusting</em> way to act – such unwarranted entitlement has no place in the open-source community or any community for that matter.</p>
<p>The world runs on open-source. The site you are reading this on was written using FOSS software and is source-available itself. I think it’s important to have open code, but the mere act of making code public now seems to create an expectation that developers must accept pull requests, manage issues, offer support, etc – all without compensation.</p>
<p>Even ickier is when people try to exploit maintainer goodwill in the name of profit, such as when corporations request features without intent to give anything in return. This corporate exploitation is even more reprehensible than some no-name script kiddy doing so. It is my opinion that the right thing to do if you’re turning a profit using open-source software is to contribute financially back to the people who develop and maintain the tools enabling your success.</p>
<h2 id="seeking-support">Seeking Support</h2>
<p>When I emphasise that support isn’t automatically offered when publishing open-source software, I mean it. That said, some projects do offer support, and I think it’s important to know how to go about it respectfully and effectively to avoid wasting both your own time and the time of those helping you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do your homework first: Search through existing issues, documentation, and forums before asking questions.</li>
<li>Provide complete information: Give all relevant details in your initial contact. No one should have to waterboard you just to find out what environment you’re using.</li>
<li>Be patient and respectful: Remember that unless you’re paying for support, the developer owes you nothing. Be polite and consider donating if you find the software valuable.</li>
<li>Use proper channels: Don’t spam developers on their personal social media or email if they’ve established official support channels. They have lives and a right to switch off.</li>
<li>Contribute where possible: Consider fixing small bugs yourself or improving documentation if you have the skills.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if you are paying or donating, still ensure you remember the person. <strong>Money doesn’t substitute manners.</strong></p>
<h2 id="making-improvements">Making Improvements</h2>
<p>There is unwarranted entitlement surrounding open-source software, and that isn’t acceptable. If you’d like to help do something about it, you can help by calling people out and standing up for maintainers when the situation arises (though take care to do it in a respectful manner). Educate, don’t ridicule. You could also consider a financial contribution, reaching out to show gratitude, setting realistic expectations yourself, and defining proper boundaries if you’re a maintainer.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Remember: access to someone else’s code is not an entitlement to their time, attention, or additional labour.</p>
