    <h1>Ask HN: How do I find my “purpose”?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>(This is a serious question, despite my username)</p><p>There are plenty of studies that show that having a &#34;purpose&#34; and working after it is correlated with higher happiness or well being. &#34;Purpose&#34; is vague enough, so to make things worse I am going to conflate it with &#34;life meaning&#34;, &#34;calling&#34; or &#34;personal values&#34;. I recently came across the Japanese &#34;Ikigai&#34; which seems related.</p><p>Ok, I buy this, however, what is this &#34;purpose/ meaning/ calling/ value&#34; thing? What does it mean, really? How do I find mine?</p><p>I think this is the kind of thing a fair amount of people here in HN have thought about, so I thought of asking.</p><p>Is there any research that goes into what is &#34;purpose&#34; and how to figure it out? I&#39;ve come across plenty that talks about how good it is, but nothing that goes into how to find it. Any serious books that you may recommend?</p></div></div></div>
