Amazon said in November it was looking to cut staff, including in its devices and recruiting organizations. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/amazon-is-looking-to-trim-headcount-through-a-voluntary-buyout-program.html">CNBC reported</a> at the time that the company was looking to lay off about 10,000 employees.</p><p>Amazon is trimming its head count after it went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic. The company&#39;s global workforce swelled to more than 1.6 million by the end of 2021, up from 798,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p><p>The company is also confronting slowing sales growth, rising expenses and a worsening economic outlook. In addition to the layoffs, Amazon has implemented a hiring freeze across its corporate workforce, slowed its warehouse expansion, and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/12/amazon-cost-cuts-under-andy-jassy-reflect-new-reality-after-25-years.html">shuttered</a> some experimental projects, including its telehealth service and a quirky, video-calling projector for kids.</p><p>Amazon isn&#39;t the only tech company making cuts to its workforce. Companies including Salesforce, Meta and Twitter have made sweeping reductions to their head counts amid a deepening economic downturn.</p><p><strong>WATCH: </strong><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/01/05/tech-layoffs-mount-as-amazon-announces-its-cutting-another-18000-workers.html">Tech layoffs mount as Amazon announces it&#39;s cutting another 18,000 jobs</a></p></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107174665"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107174665" data-vilynx-id="7000280030" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107174666-16729456621672945659-27561525142-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1672947104&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Tech layoffs mount as Amazon announces it&#39;s cutting another 18,000 workers"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
