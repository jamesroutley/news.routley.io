          I started learning Vietnamese on Duolingo three months ago. My goals
          are simple: to speak Vietnamese with my girlfriend&#39;s family, to
          communicate with locals on our future trips to Vietnam, and to teach
          Vietnamese to any children we might have.
        </p>
        <p>
          Duolingo offers exercises to learn vocabulary, translate sentences
          between English and Vietnamese, and transcribe spoken Vietnamese. I&#39;ve
          already learned basic words for fruits, vegetables, and clothing, plus
          some useful verbs. Today, I practiced question words like &#34;who&#34; and
          &#34;what.&#34;
        </p>
        <p>
          Vietnamese pronunciation doesn&#39;t depend on context. In this area, it&#39;s
          easier to learn Vietnamese than English. For example, in English, the
          &#34;a&#34; in &#34;mat&#34; is pronounced differently than the &#34;a&#34; in &#34;mate&#34;. In
          Vietnamese, &#34;a&#34; has the same pronunciation in every word.
        </p>
        <p>
          To compensate for this, Vietnamese has 12 vowels (&#34;a&#34;, &#34;ă&#34;, &#34;â&#34;, &#34;e&#34;,
          &#34;ê&#34;, &#34;i&#34;, &#34;y&#34;, &#34;o&#34;, &#34;ô&#34;, &#34;ơ&#34;, &#34;u&#34;, and &#34;ư&#34;) and an extra consonant
          letter, &#34;đ&#34;. I&#39;m still practicing the pronunciations of some of these.
          In particular, &#34;ư&#34;—a nasal &#34;u&#34; sound—was tough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vietnamese also has multiple dialects with different pronunciation. My
          girlfriend&#39;s family is from South Vietnam, but Duolingo&#39;s speech
          samples have a Northern accent and include Northern-only vocabulary.
          Thankfully, my girlfriend is teaching me Southern pronunciation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vietnamese is the first tonal language I&#39;ve learned. A single
          combination of consonant and vowel sounds (e.g., &#34;ma&#34;) can have up to
          six different meanings depending on inflection. For example, &#34;ma&#34;
          (said with the same pitch all the way through) means &#34;ghost&#34;, while
          &#34;mà&#34; (said with a falling pitch) means &#34;but&#34;. It&#39;s a challenge to
          distinguish between these tones. However, my girlfriend tells me she
          often figures out words&#39; tones from context.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me, learning any language&#39;s vocabulary is tough. On top of this,
          Vietnamese has few cognates with other languages I know. (This does
          save me from false cognates, something I struggle with in French and
          Spanish.) Vietnamese does have many loan words from both English and
          French. For example, the French word &#34;café&#34; influenced &#34;cà phê&#34;
          (Vietnamese for &#34;coffee&#34;).
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn&#39;t expect that Vietnamese would have so many words that are fun
          to say. Two of my favourites so far are &#34;thịt nướng&#34; (meaning &#34;grilled
          meat&#34;) and &#34;xe đạp&#34; (meaning &#34;bicycle&#34;).
