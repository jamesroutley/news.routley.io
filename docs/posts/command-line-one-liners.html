    <div>
        <p><strong>commandlinefu.com</strong> is the place to record those command-line gems that you return to again and again.
        That way others can gain from your <abbr title="Command-line interface">CLI</abbr> wisdom and you from theirs too.  All commands can be commented on, discussed and 
        voted up or down. </p>

    <h3>Check These Out</h3>
			
				<p>Turn your terminal into digital clock.</p>
				
			
				<p>For Mac OS X users only</p>
				
			
				<p>Usage: cmdfu hello world</p>
				
			
				<p>Set Remote Server Date using Local Server Time (push)</p>
				
			
				<p>Kill all processes with foo in them. Similar to pkill but more complete and also works when there is no pkill command. 

Works on almost every Linux/Unix platform I have tried.</p>
				
			
				<p>Shows all block devices in a tree with descruptions of what they are.</p>
				
			
				<p>Note: you&#39;ll want to set up pub-key ssh auth. Gives you a quick means of changing volume/tracks/etc for rhythmbox on a remote machine. E.g.:

rc --next # Play next track
rc --print-playing # Grab the name
rc --volume-down 
rc --help</p>
				
			
				
			
				<p>Create a tgz archive of all the files containing local changes relative to a subversion repository. 

Add the &#39;-q&#39; option to only include files under version control:
$svn st -q | cut -c 8- | sed &#39;s/^/\&#34;/;s/$/\&#34;/&#39; | xargs tar -czvf ../backup.tgz

Useful if you are not able to commit yet but want to create a quick backup of your work. Of course if you find yourself needing this it&#39;s probably a sign you should be using a branch, patches or distributed version control (git, mercurial, etc..)</p>
				
			
				<p>When you use a &#34;for&#34; construct, it cycles on every word. If you want to cycle on a line-by-line basis (and, well, you can&#39;t use xargs -n1 :D), you can set the IFS variable to .</p>
