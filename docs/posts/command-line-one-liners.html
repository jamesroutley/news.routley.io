    <div>
        <p><strong>commandlinefu.com</strong> is the place to record those command-line gems that you return to again and again.
        That way others can gain from your <abbr title="Command-line interface">CLI</abbr> wisdom and you from theirs too.  All commands can be commented on, discussed and 
        voted up or down. </p>

    <h3>Check These Out</h3>
			
				<p>We have for example :

func () {
echo FOO 
echo BAR 
}

Place the cursor under a bracket and press d + %.
It will cut everything inside and the brackets.
It let : func ()

You can copy text with y + %</p>
				
			
				<p>Installs pip packages defining a proxy</p>
				
			
				<p>Create a .png from output command or whatever, the upload and give URI from ompdlr.org</p>
				
			
				<p>This gives you lots of nifty Cisco network information like VLAN tag, port and switch information.</p>
				
			
				<p>swap out &#34;80&#34; for your port of interest. Can use port number or named ports e.g. &#34;http&#34;</p>
				
			
				<p>A null operation with the name &#39;comment&#39;, allowing comments to be written to HISTFILE. Prepending &#39;#&#39; to a command will *not* write the command to the history file, although it will be available for the current session, thus &#39;#&#39; is not useful for keeping track of comments past the current session.</p>
				
			
				<p>I recently found myself with a filesystem I couldn&#39;t write to and a bunch of files I had to get the hell out of dodge, preferably not one at a time. This command makes it possible to pack a bunch of files into a single archive and write it to a remote server.</p>
				
			
				<p>Sort disk usage from directories in the current directory</p>
				
			
				<p>Just added -sn1
-s = silent
-n1 = only one symbol needed to continue after the insert</p>
