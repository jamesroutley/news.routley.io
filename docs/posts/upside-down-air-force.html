The Air Force Research Laboratory / Information Directorate,
located at the Rome Research Site (formerly Griffiss Air Force
Base), tests electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment on
various airframes for blind spots in the EMC equipment, or
for interference by the aircraft&#39;s external munitions on the
EMC equipment.  Instead of flying the aircraft over test
antennae, the airframes (usually minus their tails) are
suspended upside-down, under or near the instrumentation.<br/>
</p><p>
Although unofficially known as the Upside Down Air Force,
airframes from the other services are also tested here.

All of these pictures were taken from public access highways.
