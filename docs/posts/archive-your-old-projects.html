    <h1>Archive Your Old Projects</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article><header></header><p>Yesterday, while looking through a folder called <em>old things lol glhf</em>, I fell
into a rabbit hole of old abandoned projects—mostly websites and graphic
design, but I also found one or two Flash projects and compiled <code>.exe</code>
files.</p>
<p>And, while it was really fun remembering projects I’ve long forgotten, there
was no structure, and it was often difficult to figure out what a project did
and what it looked like—some even missed crucial data.
This made me think about how I want to archive my projects going forward.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here is my new strategy:</p>
<h2><a href="#leave-it-online" aria-hidden="true" id="leave-it-online"></a>Leave it online</h2>
<p>If the project is on the web, doesn’t require maintenance and doesn’t cost you
money, leave it online.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you’ll need to move to a different domain, for example when re-doing
a website.
When talking to <a href="https://flbn.sh">Ollie</a> about this, he told me that some people
leave their old websites online at <code>&lt;year&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;</code> and I love that idea.</p>
<p>You can look up old content and redirect links, so your
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">URIs stay cool</a>.
And in ten years it’ll probably still be online.</p>
<h2><a href="#archive-it" aria-hidden="true" id="archive-it"></a>Archive it</h2>
<p>If you can’t leave it online, save it to your file system.
You don’t have to go all <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com">Johnny.Decimal</a>, but at
least create a dedicated folder and subfolders for every year.</p>
<p>But instead of just copying your project to the archive folder and be done with
it, consider these points to make life easier for your future self:</p>
<dl><dt>Make screenshots</dt>
<dd>
<p>Having a screenshot allows you to relive your memories more easily without
going through the hassle of setting up a project.
If you want to go the extra mile, do a screen recording showcasing your
project—this has the bonus effect of hearing your voice from years ago, and it
has more context.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Add a README</dt>
<dd>
<p>Explain what the project did, when it was created and abandoned, who
contributed and how to get it running again.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Back up the database</dt>
<dd>
<p>Some of my projects are missing a database dump, so all the actual content is
gone. Run <code>sqldump</code> or whatever export functionality your database supports
and add it next to your files.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Keep generated assets</dt>
<dd>
<p>When using static site generators, add the folder containing the built HTML,
CSS &amp; JS to the archive.
That way, all you have to do is run a static file server to be able to browse
the complete website.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2><a href="#save-it-to-the-internet-archive" aria-hidden="true" id="save-it-to-the-internet-archive"></a>Save it to the Internet Archive</h2>
<p>If you don’t own your platform (maybe you’re publishing to Substack or Notion),
you can at least save your website to the
<a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a>.
I would also advise saving your content somewhere you control.</p>
<h2><a href="#show-me-yours" aria-hidden="true" id="show-me-yours"></a>Show me yours</h2>
<p>So that’s it, that’s my new project archival strategy.</p>
<p>How are you archiving your projects?
Am I missing anything?
