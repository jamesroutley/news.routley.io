        <p dir="auto">In a move to streamline development and strengthen our commitment to the open-source community, AMD is unifying its Linux Vulkan driver strategy and has decided to discontinue the AMDVLK open-source project, throwing our full support behind the RADV driver as the officially supported open-source Vulkan driver for Radeonâ„¢ graphics adapters.</p>
<p dir="auto">This consolidation allows us to focus our resources on a single, high-performance codebase that benefits from the incredible work of the entire open-source community. We invite developers and users alike to utilize the RADV driver and contribute to its future.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Learn more about RADV: <a href="https://docs.mesa3d.org/drivers/radv.html" rel="nofollow">Mesa RADV Documentation</a></li>
<li>Contribute to the code: <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/tree/main/src/amd/vulkan" rel="nofollow">Mesa GitLab Repository</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We are excited about this focused path forward and are committed to the continued success of open-source Vulkan on Radeon.</p>
