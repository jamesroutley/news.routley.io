    <p>A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands — including RadioShack, Modell&#39;s Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports — out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme. </p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.</p><p>Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens &#39;n Things were also among their acquisitions. </p><p>REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/radioshacks-long-decline-ends-in-bankruptcy/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">first filed</a></span> for Chapter 11 protection in 2015. In 2023, Unicomer Group acquired RadioShack, and in 2024, relaunched it as an e-commerce platform. RadioShack&#39;s current owners are not named in the lawsuit.</p><p>Modell&#39;s Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/modells-files-for-bankruptcy-plans-to-close-all-stores/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">March 2020</a></span>, when it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV <a href="https://chainstoreage.com/modells-sporting-goods-assets-acquired-live-online" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">bought</a> the Modell&#39;s brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports — which still exists as an online store — declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.</p>

    

<p>The SEC&#39;s suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, &#34;made material misrepresentations&#34; to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were &#34;on fire&#34; and that &#34;cash flow is strong.&#34; They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be invested in that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC&#39;s lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.</p><p>&#34;Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,&#34; the suit states. &#34;Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.&#34; </p><p>Neither Mehr nor Lopez immediately responded to CBS News&#39; request for comment. </p><p>The SEC alleges that at least $5.9 million of returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors, as opposed to companies&#39; profits. </p>

    
    

<p>Additionally, the federal regulatory agency claims that Mehr and Lopez allocated $16 million worth of investments for their own use, according to the filing. </p><p>REV Chief Operating Officer Maya Burkenroad is also accused of aiding Lopez and Mehr&#39;s alleged crimes. On REV&#39;s website, Burkenroad, who is Lopez&#39;s cousin, was described as having &#34;over 10 years of experience managing multi-million-dollar companies,&#34; according to the complaint. </p><p>But the SEC claims Lopez and Mehr misrepresented her experience. Before joining REV, she had worked as a substitute preschool teacher, a promoter at a radio station, and as an assistant to Lopez at a prior endeavor, the complaint alleges.</p><p>Burkenroad didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>
