<li>Tesla sales in Germany plunged by 59.5% in January 2025 and 76.3% in February.</li>



<li>In Australia, the EV maker’s deliveries dropped 65.5% in the first two months of 2025.</li>



<li>Tesla’s February 2025 sales in China fell 49.16%, signaling a market share decline.</li>

<p>Tesla was proudly proclaiming less than a year ago that it would be selling 20 million electric vehicles annually by 2030. Fast forward to today, and things have taken a sharp downturn. After seemingly abandoning this lofty goal mid-2024, the company has also seen its first annual sales decline in a decade. Now, Tesla’s sales are continuing to slide in several major markets, including Germany, Australia, and, of course, China.</p>
		
		



<p><a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2025/03/tesla-sales-plunge-44-in-norway-despite-ev-market-soaring-by-53/">Earlier this week</a>, we reported that <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/tesla/">Tesla</a> sales in Norway collapsed by 44.4% through January and February, despite the country’s overall EV market growing by 53.4%. Things are even worse in Germany. New data from the KBA – Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority – shows that in January 2025, Tesla sales plummeted by 59.5%, with just 1,277 new cars registered in the country.</p>

<p>The situation only worsened in February. Sales were down a staggering 76.3% compared to February 2024, with just 1,429 units sold. Through January and February, Tesla has delivered 2,706 vehicles in <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/germany/">Germany</a>, marking a massive 70.6% drop from the same period last year. Tesla’s decline is even more pronounced when you consider that overall BEV sales in Germany climbed 30.8% in February.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/australia/">Australia</a> isn’t much better. Data from the nation’s Electric Vehicle Council shows that Tesla shifted 1,592 vehicles in February, a massive 71.9% decline from the 5,665 sold in February 2024. Through the first two months of the year, Tesla delivered 2,331 vehicles to Australians, a 65.5% decline from the 6,772 vehicles sold over the same two months in 2024. </p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that the highly anticipated, heavily updated Model Y has just started being sold in Australia—though only in the premium (A$73,400) Launch Edition variant, with the standard version still unavailable. So, the sales slump isn’t entirely surprising. </p>



<p>Even so, the outgoing Model Y saw a 55.4% decline, shifting only 924 units. Meanwhile, sales of the refreshed Model 3 are down a dramatic 81.4%, with just 668 cars sold. It seems Australians aren’t quite as eager to embrace the “Tesla dream” as they once were.</p>



<p><strong>Chinese Struggles</strong></p>
		
		



<p>And then there’s <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/china/">China</a>, where things are also looking grim for Tesla in one of its most important markets worldwide. Preliminary data from China’s Passenger Car Association reveals that Tesla built and sold 30,688 vehicles in February 2025—a 49.16% drop from the 60,365 cars moved in February 2024. This total includes both domestic sales and exports, but it’s clear that Tesla’s Chinese market share is shrinking. When you factor in competition from local EV manufacturers, the picture becomes even murkier.</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that Tesla’s global growth trajectory has hit some roadblocks. While the company remains a leader in the electric vehicle space, its once-unassailable dominance in key markets is showing signs of distress. Whether it’s product fatigue, the controversial nature of its CEO, market saturation, or just bad timing—especially with the transition surrounding its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, the shine is definitely starting to wear off.</p>
