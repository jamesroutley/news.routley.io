<p><span>Red Hat, Inc. v. Daniel Pocock /
Software Freedom Institute SA</span></p>

<p><span>Claim Number: FA2201001980642</span></p>



<h2><span>PARTIES</span></h2>

<p><span>Complainant
is<b> Red Hat, Inc. </b>(“Complainant”), represented by<b> Maury M. Tepper</b>,
<b>III</b> of <b>Tepper &amp; Eyster, PLLC</b>, North Carolina, USA. 
Respondent is<b> Daniel Pocock / Software Freedom Institute SA </b>(“Respondent”),
Switzerland.</span></p>



<p><b><span>REGISTRAR AND DISPUTED DOMAIN
NAME </span></b></p>

<p><span>The
domain name at issue is<b> &lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</b>, registered with <b>Gandi
SAS</b>.</span></p>



<p><b><span>PANEL</span></b></p>

<p><span>The
undersigned certifies that he has acted independently and impartially and to
the best of his knowledge has no known conflict in serving as Panelist in this
proceeding.</span></p>



<p><a name="_Hlk97648257"><span>Alan L. Limbury</span></a><span>, as Panelist.</span></p>



<h2><span>PROCEDURAL
HISTORY</span></h2>

<p><span>Complainant
submitted a Complaint to the <span>Forum </span>electronically
on January 17, 2022. The <span>Forum </span>received
payment on January 17, 2022.</span></p>



<p><span>On
January 18, 2022, Gandi SAS confirmed by e-mail to the <span>Forum</span> that the<b> &lt;wemakefedora.org&gt; </b>domain name
is registered with Gandi SAS and that Respondent is the current registrant of
the name.  Gandi SAS has verified that Respondent is bound by the Gandi SAS
registration agreement and has thereby agreed to resolve domain disputes
brought by third parties in accordance with ICANN’s Uniform Domain Name Dispute
Resolution Policy (the “Policy”).</span></p>



<p><span>On
January 18, 2022, the <span>Forum</span> served
the Complaint and all Annexes, including a Written Notice of the Complaint,
setting a deadline of February 28, 2022 by which Respondent could file a
Response to the Complaint, via e-mail to all entities and persons listed on
Respondent’s registration as technical, administrative, and billing contacts,
and to postmaster@wemakefedora.org.  Also on January 18, 2022, the Written
Notice of the Complaint, notifying Respondent of the e-mail addresses served
and the deadline for a Response, was transmitted to Respondent via post and
fax, to all entities and persons listed on Respondent’s registration as
technical, administrative and billing contacts.</span></p>



<p><span>A
timely Response was received and determined to be complete on February 28, 2022.</span></p>



<p><span>On
March 7, 2022, pursuant to Complainant&#39;s request to have the dispute decided by
a single-member Panel, the <span>Forum</span>
appointed Alan L. Limbury as Panelist.</span></p>



<h2><span>RELIEF
SOUGHT</span></h2>

<p><span>Complainant
requests that the domain name be </span><span>transferred from Respondent to
Complainant.</span></p>



<h2><span>PARTIES&#39;
CONTENTIONS</span></h2>

<p><span>A.
Complainant</span></p>

<p><span>Complainant
<span>is a leading provider of open-source software and
support</span>. Complainant offers a range of products, including Linux
platforms, middleware, cloud computing and storage for companies in a wide
range of industries, and provides support and training and certification
courses for its software.  </span></p>



<p><span>Complainant
has used the trademark FEDORA in connection with these goods and services since
at least as early as September, 2001<a name="_Hlk97655020"> and has advertised them
over the Internet via the web site “www.getfedora.org” since 2014. Complainant
has rights in the FEDORA mark through registration of the mark with the United
States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). Respondent’s<b> <span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</span> </b>domain name
is confusingly similar to Complainant’s mark.</a></span></p>



<p><span>Respondent
has no rights to or legitimate interests in the <b><span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</span></b> domain name. Respondent is not
commonly known by the domain name. <a name="_Hlk97987719">Complainant has not
consented to Respondent’s use of the domain name </a>and has not authorized or
licensed to Respondent any rights in the FEDORA mark. Additionally, Respondent
does not use the domain name for any <i>bona fide</i> offering of goods or
services or legitimate noncommercial or fair use. Instead, Respondent’s
adoption of a name that is virtually identical to Complainant’s registered
trademark to offer or to discuss software and software design and development
services does not constitute any right or legitimate interest in the domain
name on the part of Respondent.</span></p>



<p><span>Respondent
registered the <b><span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</span></b>
domain name in bad faith with actual knowledge of Complainant’s rights in the FEDORA
mark and did so in order to disrupt Complainant’s business.  Respondent uses the
domain name in bad faith to divert Complainant’s customers for commercial gain.
</span></p>



<p><span>B.
Respondent</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU">The prefix “We Make” is not
confusing. It is entirely accurate. As an open-source     product, volunteers
make Fedora side by side with the employees of Complainant. This is noted in Complainant’s
founding documents, Exhibit 104:</span></p>



<p><i><span lang="EN-AU">“There is a place in
Fedora for anyone who wants to help, regardless of technical skill level, as
long as they believe in our core values. Like any friends, we occasionally
disagree on details, but we believe in finding an acceptable consensus to serve
the interests of advancing free software. We believe in a strong partnership
between Red Hat and our enormous volunteer community, since they both provide
essential contributions that help the Fedora Project succeed.”</span></i></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">This statement makes it clear
that Respondent’s Software Freedom Institute SA and other institutions are
welcome collaborators on Complainant’s Fedora product. Complainant operates an
official site, <i>FedoraPlanet.org </i>which aggregates blogs from volunteers.
It is very similar to </span><b><span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</span></b><span lang="EN-AU">. Nonetheless, <i>FedoraPlanet.org
</i>has chosen to censor the contributions of some volunteers (Exhibit 114). </span><b><span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</span></b><i><span> </span></i><span lang="EN-AU">includes the censored blogs.
This is an important distinction that justifies the existence of a web site
that is inevitably similar.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">To avoid any confusion, there is
a disclaimer at the top of the web page informing visitors about the trademark
and giving visitors a direct link to the trademark holder&#39;s official web page.</span></p>



<p><span>As
to legitimacy, </span><span lang="EN-AU">on
March 30, 2021, Complainant acknowledged and consented to the use of the
trademark by volunteers (Exhibits 101 and 102). For 10 months after that email
exchange Complainant did not make any legal complaint, despite being well aware
of Respondent’s web site.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Complainant does not pay us for
contributions of intellectual property but gives us badges recognizing our
efforts. These further convey the rights of all volunteers to assert We Make
Fedora. As We Make Fedora, we are authoring a software product as volunteers
and as a community. We have a clear right and interest in asserting our
authorship. </span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">During 2021 various community
members published blogs that were censored from the official aggregation site
operated by Complainant (<i>FedoraPlanet.org</i>) but they appeared uncensored
on the </span><b><span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</span></b><i><span> </span></i><span lang="EN-AU">aggregation site, which provides
a means for volunteers to highlight their work, past and present, despite the
efforts of other parties to delete or disparage those contributions. </span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">As to bad faith, Complainant has
submitted five articles posted by different volunteers on </span><b><span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</span></b><span lang="EN-AU"> in early October
2021 which appear to describe technical subjects and social phenomena in the
open-source community (Exhibit 4). None of these articles appear to be asking
for money. None of them are asking visitors to abandon <a name="_Hlk97897009">Complainant’s</a>
Fedora product and use an alternative. These blogs complement the development
of Complainant’s Fedora product. Through its founding documents (Exhibit 104), Complainant
encourages volunteers to contribute content and speak freely.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Respondent’s </span><b><span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</span></b><i><span> </span></i><span lang="EN-AU">website does not feature banner
advertising or any other additions to the content. It only contains the
original content created by Fedora volunteers. The only banner on the site is
the disclaimer encouraging people to download Fedora, which includes
contributions from the volunteers, from Complainant&#39;s official download page.
Therefore, the claim that Respondent is operating the site for commercial gain
is unsubstantiated and somewhat vexatious.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The Complaint appears to be
about stifling the voices of volunteers in the community and suppressing
evidence of our authorship of intellectual property in the open-source products
distributed under the trademark FEDORA.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Respondent clearly has an
interest in the domain name due to the communication from the trademark owner
at the time of registration, public statements made by Complainant encouraging
us to engage in free ways of working and the longstanding history of joint
authorship of the trademarked product, FEDORA.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The domain name is not used in
bad faith, given that the web site directs people back to the trademark owner&#39;s
site, doesn&#39;t ask for money, doesn&#39;t run banner advertising, doesn&#39;t ask for
personal registration. It has been demonstrated that the trademark owner is
suppressing the blogs of some volunteers with authorship rights and Respondent’s
site exists to give those voices an equal status. The founding documents
published by the trademark owner (Exhibit 104) encourage us to give voice to
all sides.</span></p>



<h2><span>FINDINGS</span></h2>

<p><span>Complainant
has failed to establish all the elements entitling it to relief and has <span>brought the Complaint primarily to harass the domain-name
holder</span>.</span></p>



<h2><span>DISCUSSION</span></h2>

<p><span>Paragraph
15(a) of the Rules instructs this Panel to &#34;decide a complaint on the
basis of the statements and documents submitted in accordance with the Policy,
these Rules and any rules and principles of law that it deems applicable.&#34;</span></p>



<p><span>Paragraph
4(a) of the Policy requires that Complainant must prove each of the following
three elements to obtain an order that a domain name should be cancelled or
transferred:</span></p>



<p><span>(1)<span>Â  </span></span><span>the domain name registered by Respondent
is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which
Complainant has rights; and</span></p>

<p><span>(2)<span>Â  </span></span><span>Respondent has no rights or
legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and</span></p>

<p><span>(3)<span>Â  </span></span><span>the domain name has been
registered and is being used in bad faith.</span></p>



<h3><u><span>Identical
and/or Confusingly Similar</span></u></h3>

<p><span>Complainant
has shown that it has rights in the FEDORA mark through registration of the
mark with the USPTO (<i>e.g., </i>Reg. No. 3,283,928 registered August 21, 2007).<i>
</i></span></p>





<p><span lang="EN-AU">“It is well accepted
that the first element functions primarily as a standing requirement. The
standing (or threshold) test for confusing similarity involves a reasoned but
relatively straightforward comparison between the complainant’s trademark and
the disputed domain name.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">This test typically
involves a side-by-side comparison of the domain name and the textual
components of the relevant trademark to assess whether the mark is recognizable
within the disputed domain name…”</span></p>



<p><span>Applying
this test, the Panel finds </span><span>Respondent’s<b>
<span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</span> </b>domain
name to be confusingly similar to Complainant’s mark because it incorporates the
FEDORA mark in its entirety and adds the descriptive words “we make”, which do
not distinguish the domain name from the mark, and the inconsequential “.org” generic
top-level domain (“gTLD”), which may be ignored. </span></p>



<p><span>Complainant
has established this element.</span></p>



<h3><u><span>Rights
or Legitimate Interests</span></u></h3>

<p><a name="_Hlk38207291"><span>Paragraph 4(c) of the Policy
sets out three illustrative circumstances as examples which, if established by
Respondent, shall demonstrate rights to or legitimate interests in the domain
name for purposes of paragraph 4(a)(ii) of the Policy, <i>i.e.</i></span></a></p>



<p><span>(i)         before
any notice to Respondent of the dispute, the use by Respondent of, or
demonstrable preparations to use, the domain name or a name corresponding to
the domain name in connection with a <i>bona fide</i> offering of goods or
services; or</span></p>



<p><span>(ii)        Respondent
(as an individual, business or other organization) has been commonly known by
the domain name, even if Respondent has acquired no trademark or service mark
rights; or</span></p>



<p><span>(iii)       Respondent
is making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the domain name, without
intent for commercial gain to misleadingly divert customers or to tarnish the
trademark or service mark at issue.</span></p>



<p><span>The
<a name="_Hlk97985599"><b><span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</span></b>
</a>domain name was registered on March 29, 2021, many years after the
registration of Complainant’s FEDORA mark, at a time when Respondent has shown
that he had been contributing for some years as an unpaid volunteer to the
content of Complainant’s website and had received numerous badges in
recognition of his efforts.<span> </span></span></p>



<p><span>Complainant says it has not consented to Respondent’s use of the
domain name. However, in an email dated March 30, 2021 (</span><span lang="EN-AU">Exhibit 101), Complainant
consented to Respondent’s use of the domain name so long as the website
followed Complainant’s trademark guidelines relating to Community sites and accounts</span><span>.  </span></p>



<p><span>Those guidelines are as follows:</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">“Community
sites and accounts</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU">Fedora
defines <a name="_Hlk97986357">community sites and accounts </a>as pages
related to the Fedora Project, but not officially maintained by Marketing team
members or Social Media administrators. Often, these groups are specific to a
region or country. These pages are usually run by an individual contributor or
a group of contributors. These sites are non-commercial in nature (they are not
selling a product).</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Examples
of these pages include (but are not limited to):</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU">·<span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
</span></span><span lang="EN-AU">placing the Fedora Trademarks on a personal web site or blog to
support Fedora</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU">·<span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
</span></span><span lang="EN-AU">making a page on a social networking web service to support Fedora</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU">·<span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
</span></span><span lang="EN-AU">linking to Fedora from a wiki to provide information or show
support for Fedora</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">While
these online community sites and accounts are not officially endorsed by the
Fedora Project or Red Hat, because they are part of the Fedora Community (and
use the Fedora trademarks to identify themselves), their site owners,
moderators, administrators, and users are required to comply with
theÂ Fedora Code of Conduct. Community sites and accounts which are unable
to meet this standard of conduct will be required to cease use of the Fedora
trademarks, and will be not be promoted/advertised by Fedora. Our intent is for
all Fedora community members to have a positive and welcoming experience in all
community spaces, official and unofficial.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">It is
permissible to use the Fedora Trademarks on community sites and accounts to
show your support for the Fedora Project, provided that:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU">·<span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
</span></span><span lang="EN-AU">where possible, the design logo hyperlinks to the Fedora Project
website,Â http://fedoraproject.org/, or if that is not possible, the site
includes a prominent link to the Fedora Project website
atÂ http://fedoraproject.org/.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU">·<span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
</span></span><span lang="EN-AU">the site indicates clearly that it is not affiliated with or
endorsed by the Fedora Project; in addition, where possible:</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU">o<span>Â Â Â  </span></span><span lang="EN-AU">the site
must include the text &#34;This site is not affiliated with or endorsed by the
Fedora Project&#34; prominently on any page that includes the Fedora
Trademarks, and</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU">o<span>Â Â Â  </span></span><span lang="EN-AU">if the
Fedora Trademarks appear in a page header or any area that is designed to be
presented on more than one page, the notice must also be designed to be
presented on all of those pages as well. (i.e., if the Fedora Trademarks appear
in a site-wide header, the informational text must appear in that header or an
identically site-wide footer.)</span></p>

<p><span>·<span>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
</span></span><span lang="EN-AU">the site does not use visual styling that could be confusing to
viewers or visitors as to whether the site is hosted by or on behalf of the
Fedora Project.”</span></p>



<p><span>The
<b><span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt;</span></b> domain
name resolves to a web site containing multiple blog posts on topics related to
software, including in particular, uncensored versions of blogs previously appearing
in censored form on Complainant’s website.  The landing page of Respondent’s
web site prominently features the name “We Make Fedora”, indicating that “we”
are contributors to Complainant’s </span><span lang="EN-AU">community sites and accounts</span><span>. </span></p>



<p><span>Complainant
has shown that Respondent’s website also features prominently<span> </span>the following statement, including links
to Complainant’s web pages: </span></p>



<p><span>“Fedora is a Trademark of Red
Hat, Inc,  an operating system built by volunteers around the world.  This page
is provided so that independent volunteers can showcase our contributions to
Fedora and Free Software  in general. Official Fedora Download page ” (Complaint
Exhibit 4).</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">There are no advertisements on
the Respondent&#39;s website. There is no evidence that Respondent is a competitor
of Complainant, nor is there any evidence that Respondent has operated the website
for any commercial purpose. The Panel rejects Complainant&#39;s submission,
unsupported by evidence, that Respondent&#39;s conduct is likely to have been
undertaken for commercial gain.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The Panel finds that Respondent
is operating a genuine, noncommercial website from a domain name that contains
an appendage (&#34;we make&#34;) that, as noted in the Response, is clearly
an identifier of contributors to Complainant’s website. In registering the domain
name using an appendage that identifies Complainant’s contributors, Respondent is
not attempting to impersonate Complainant nor misleadingly to divert Internet
users. Rather, Respondent is using the FEDORA mark in the domain name to
identify Complainant for the purpose of operating a website that contains some criticism
of Complainant. Such use is generally described as &#34;fair use&#34; of a
trademark.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Accordingly, t</span><span>he Panel finds that the
Respondent has rights or legitimate interests in the <b><span>&lt;wemakefedora.org&gt; </span></b>domain name both because Complainant
consented to Respondent’s use of the domain name s</span><span lang="EN-AU">o long as the website followed
Complainant’s trademark guidelines</span><span>
and because Respondent is making a legitimate noncommercial or fair use of the
domain name, without intent for commercial gain misleadingly to divert Internet
users or to tarnish Complainant&#39;s FEDORA trademark. </span></p>



<p><span>Complainant
has failed to establish this element.</span></p>



<h3><u><span>Registration
and Use in Bad Faith</span></u></h3>

<h3><span>In light of the Panel’s findings in relation to the second
element, it is unnecessary to consider this element.</span></h3>



<h3><u><span>Reverse Domain Name Hijacking</span></u></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-AU">Respondent requests that the
Panel consider whether the Complaint amounts to harassment under UDRP Rule
15(e).</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">Paragraph 15(e) of
the Rules provides that if “after considering the submissions the panel finds
that the complaint was brought in bad faith, for example in an attempt at
Reverse Domain Name Hijacking or was brought primarily to harass the
domain-name holder, the panel shall declare in its decision <a name="_Hlk53403759">that the complaint was brought in bad faith and constitutes
an abuse of the administrative proceeding</a>”. Reverse Domain Name Hijacking
(RDNH) is defined under the Rules as “using the UDRP in bad faith to attempt to
deprive a registered domain-name holder of a domain name”.</span></p>



<p><span lang="EN-AU">The mere lack of
success of the complaint is not itself sufficient for a finding of Reverse
Domain Name Hijacking; rather, as<span> stated in
the </span></span><span lang="EN-AU">WIPO
Jurisprudential Overview 3.0, paragraph<b> </b></span><span lang="EN-AU">4.16:
</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-AU">“</span><span lang="EN-AU">Reasons
articulated by panels for finding RDNH include: (i) facts which demonstrate
that the complainant knew it could not succeed as to any of the required three
elements – such as the complainant’s lack of relevant trademark rights, clear
knowledge of respondent rights or legitimate interests, or clear knowledge of a
lack of respondent bad faith (see generally section 3.8) such as registration
of the disputed domain name well before the complainant acquired trademark
rights…”</span></p>



<p><span>Despite
Complainant having consented, on the day after Respondent registered the domain
name, to Respondent’s use of the domain name for a website, so long as Respondent
complied with Complainant’s trademark guidelines, the Complaint does not
contain contend that Respondent has failed to comply with those guidelines.
Instead, the Complaint asserts that Complainant has not consented to
Respondent’s use of the domain name and that Respondent’s adoption of a name
that is virtually identical to Complaint’s registered trademark to offer or to
discuss software and software design and development services does not
constitute any right or legitimate interest in the domain name on the part of
Respondent.</span></p>



<p><span>In light of these circumstances the Panel finds that
Complainant brought this proceeding despite having clear knowledge of Respondent’s
rights or legitimate interests in the domain name and that the proceeding was
brought </span><span>primarily
to harass the domain-name holder. </span></p>



<h2><span>DECISION</span></h2>

<p><span>Complainant
having failed to establish all three elements required under the ICANN Policy,
the Panel concludes that relief shall be <b>DENIED </b>and<b> </b><span>declares that the Complaint was brought in bad faith and
constitutes an abuse of the administrative proceeding.</span></span></p>



<p><span>Accordingly,
it is Ordered that the<b> &lt;wemakefedora.org&gt; </b>domain name <b>REMAIN
WITH</b> Respondent.</span></p>
