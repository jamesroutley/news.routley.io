    <p>I&#39;ve been using Feeder to keep up with the news for awhile now. For a long time, I just checked AllSides.</p>
<p>But then I found out NPR in my state supports RSS, my local news org supports RSS, and YouTube even supports RSS!</p>
<p>One outlet I really like is GovTrack.us, and they did not support RSS - so I emailed them about it, and they added support.</p>
<p>Feeder&#39;s news website wasn&#39;t working with the Feeder app, so I emailed them and they fixed it.</p>
<p>I learned my State Senator&#39;s website supports RSS, but my state&#39;s GOP website does not - so I emailed the GOP asking for RSS. We&#39;ll see.</p>
<p>I emailed Ubisoft/Nadeo asking for RSS support on the Trackmania news website. They replied that they&#39;ll send the suggestion to dev team. We&#39;ll see.</p>
<p>I spoke at my Library&#39;s Board meeting last night asking for RSS support on their website. Seemed well-received. We&#39;ll see.</p>
<p>Substack supports RSS. Jurist.org supports RSS. Justia&#39;s supreme court summaries support RSS (<em>I used to read those, but I don&#39;t any more</em>). Blogger supports RSS.</p>
<p>So yeah - If you are interested in an organization&#39;s updates, then get a feed reader app, and subscribe to their feed on their website. If they don&#39;t have a feed, just ask them to add one!</p>
<p>You&#39;ll be surprised how nice it is to keep up with things you actually care about in a way that you&#39;re completely in control of, without bloat, without ads, without algorithms.</p>
<p>Please advocate for more RSS support - especially with orgs you want to stay up-to-date with. This can be video game news websites, government organizations, political news websites, entertainment platforms, blogs, or whatever.</p>
