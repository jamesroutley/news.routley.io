    <h1>Ask HN: What is your experience with Nano-Hydroxyapatite toothpaste?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have really bad tooth sensitivity and I recently learned about n-Ha toothpaste being a solid treatment for it (mainly the one Boka sells) The fact that n-Ha is the compound that enamel is made of seems really promising but I don’t know enough about it to know if it’ll work and it’s really hard to trust product reviews. Money is in short supply so I really want to make sure I’m not buying into a fad.</p><p>I know you all are not dentists or chemists (I’m assuming anyway), but we’ll have the same teeth, so if you happened to use it for a similar purpose and saw good results, I want to know about your experience.</p><p>Thank you all.</p></div></div></div>
