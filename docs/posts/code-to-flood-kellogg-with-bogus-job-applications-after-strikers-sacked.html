                        <p>An activist on TikTok posted code online meant to flood the Kellogg website with fake job applications in protest against the company&#39;s decision to permanently replace striking workers. </p><p>Kellogg <a href="https://newsroom.kelloggcompany.com/2021-12-07-Employees-reject-tentative-agreement-Kellogg-focuses-on-continuing-operations" data-analytics-module="body_link">announced</a> on Wednesday that it would replace almost <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kellogg-replacing-1400-striking-workers-reject-deal-wage-increase-2021-12" data-analytics-module="body_link">1,400 unionized workers</a> after the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers, and Grain Millers union rejected a pay deal. The workers have been on strike <a href="https://bctgm2021rteccontract.com/?playlist=59ee60ab&amp;video=1c9ee01" data-analytics-module="body_link">since October</a> over what they say is unfair pay and benefits. </p><p>&#34;The prolonged work stoppage has left us no choice but to continue executing the next phase of our contingency plan, including hiring replacement employees in positions vacated by striking workers,&#34; Kellogg&#39;s press release said. </p><p>The company advertised for the permanent replacements at four production sites: in Omaha, Nebraska; Battle Creek, Michigan; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; and Memphis, Tennessee. </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p><a href="https://jobs.kellogg.com/job/Omaha-Permanent-Production-Associate-Omaha-NE-68103/817685900/z" data-analytics-module="body_link">The advertisements</a> directly cited the dispute: &#34;The Unions representing Kellogg employees in these plants are on strike, and we are looking for employees to  permanently replace them, joining hundreds of Kellogg salaried employees, hourly employees, and contractors to keep the lines running.&#34;</p><p>Earlier job adverts for temporary workers encouraged applicants to <a href="https://www.insider.com/kelloggs-hiring-strike-replacement-workers-labor-union-cross-picket-line-2021-10" data-analytics-module="body_link">&#34;cross the picket line&#34;</a> to join the company. </p><p>People on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/rcacru/apply_now_kellogg_is_hiring_scabs_online_lets/" data-analytics-module="body_link">popular subreddit r/antiwork</a> took up the workers&#39; cause on Thursday. </p><p>A user with the handle BloominFunions posted links to the four job applications and encouraged the subreddit&#39;s 1.3 million-strong membership to individually submit fake applications, or as they put it, &#34;clog their toilet of an application pipeline.&#34;</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Kellogg &#34;don&#39;t even hide the fact that they&#39;re hiring scabs,&#34; user BloominFunions wrote, using a dismissive term for workers who ignore strikes. The post had been upvoted 62,000 times at the time of writing. </p><p>After that, the activist and developer Sean Black, who uses the handle black_madness21 on TikTok, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@black_madness21/video/7039823665294232878" data-analytics-module="body_link">told his followers</a> how he&#39;d made the application process even easier. </p><p>&#34;Apparently Kellogg are planning to replace workers who are fighting for better workplace conditions and better pay,&#34; Black said. He added, &#34;You know what I had to do.&#34;</p><p>Demonstrating the code in process, Black said it automatically creates an account, fills in all personal details, and uploads a résumé on the company&#39;s site. &#34;Not bad for a day&#39;s work, I&#39;d say,&#34; he said.</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>It&#39;s not the first time Black has used this tactic. In September, he made similar code to help activists <a href="https://www.insider.com/texas-abortion-prolife-whistleblower-website-heartbeat-bill-anti-abortion-2021-9" data-analytics-module="body_link">flood a website</a> set up by the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life. </p><p>The website encouraged people to submit tips about those who broke the newly enacted law known as the Texas Heartbeat Act, which drastically reduced abortion access. The effort prompted people on social-media platforms to encourage the submission of <a href="https://www.insider.com/people-are-spamming-a-pro-life-tip-line-in-texas-2021-8" data-analytics-module="body_link">fake tips</a> to overwhelm the site. </p>
