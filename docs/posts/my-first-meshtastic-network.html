    <h1>My First Meshtastic Network</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
          
          <p>I first heard about <a href="https://meshtastic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meshtastic</a> from <a href="https://blog.noforeignland.com/off-grid-boat-communications-with-meshtastic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a blog post</a> that made the rounds on Hacker News.</p>

<h2>My First Radio</h2>

<p>Out of the box, the devices had outdated firmware and wouldn&#39;t communicate with current Meshtastic apps. Fortunately, flashing the latest firmware was straightforward using the official <strong>Meshtastic Web Flasher</strong> (a browser-based tool at <a href="https://flasher.meshtastic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flasher.meshtastic.org</a>). By connecting the device via USB and using Chrome (which supports the WebSerial API), I flashed the newest Meshtastic firmware without installing any software.</p>

<h2>Initial Setup</h2>

<p>After setup, I had my two devices chatting with each other. Sending a message from one device would pop up on the other in a few seconds. Meshtastic uses a mesh protocol where every node repeats messages, so two devices in direct range will communicate one-to-one, and if more nodes are around they can hop messages further. I noticed that if I tried sending when only one device was on, the app would show <q>Waiting to be acknowledged...</q> and eventually <q>Maximum retransmission reached.</q> In other words, my message went nowhere because no other node heard it.</p>

<h2>First Contact</h2>

<p>Up to this point, I hadn&#39;t heard any traffic besides my own test messages. I suspected I was the only Meshtastic user in my immediate area (the far west suburbs of Chicago). I left one radio powered on and placed it by a second-story window facing toward the city. The next morning, I was surprised to see that it had logged messages from a handful of unknown nodes overnight.</p>

<p>Looking up the node identifiers online, I discovered a website called <a href="https://meshmap.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MeshMap</a> that shows public Meshtastic nodes on a map. Sure enough, some of the node names I saw appeared on a community mesh map of the Chicagoland area. A few even had labels referencing <q>ChiMesh</q>. There&#39;s an active group of Meshtastic enthusiasts in Chicago, <a href="https://chicagolandmesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chicagoland Mesh</a>, and somehow my little device had picked up their transmissions from roughly 40-50 miles away. This was an early sign that mesh networking can extend beyond line-of-sight with the help of intermediate nodes.</p>

<h2>Joining a Local Community</h2>

<p>Excited by this discovery, I joined the Chicagoland Mesh (ChiMesh) Discord server and introduced myself. To my surprise, there was another member only a mile or two from my house. We coordinated a simple experiment: he sent a test message from his device at home, and I was able to receive it on mine. However, when I tried to reply, he never saw my message. It became clear that while I could <q>hear</q> the network, my transmission range was too short for others to hear me.</p>

<p>Community members quickly pointed to the antenna as the culprit. The stock rubber-duck antenna that came with my Heltec radio was likely low-quality. I switched to the high-gain antenna I bought and tried again. This time my messages started getting through. Antenna quality (and placement) makes a huge difference in radio range.</p>

<h2>Expanding the Network</h2>

<p><img src="https://rickcarlino.com/notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020251228224246.png" alt="Pasted image 20251228224246.png"/></p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p><img src="https://rickcarlino.com/notes/images/Pasted%20image%2020251228224347.png" alt="Pasted image 20251228224347.png"/></p>

<p>In the coming months, we plan to upgrade to better antennas (perhaps an outdoor mounted one on a mast) and add more nodes at strategic spots. I&#39;m also interested in experimenting with Meshtastic&#39;s other capabilities. For example, it can interface with sensors and send telemetry. A fun project idea is an off-grid weather station broadcasting its data over the mesh network.</p>

<h2>Continuing the Exploration</h2>

<p>Working with Meshtastic has been fun. It&#39;s impressive how a few inexpensive devices can form a communications network covering many miles. The system is limited, but within those constraints it feels magical to send a message into the ether and have it hop across a county line to a stranger.</p>

<p>Meshtastic isn&#39;t very useful alone, but as more people join, the mesh becomes stronger and more useful for everyone. If you&#39;re in the Illinois Fox Valley area and interested, feel free to reach out or drop by our makerspace meetup - we&#39;d love to grow the network. And if you&#39;re elsewhere, consider looking up <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/community/local-groups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meshtastic groups in your region</a>. I hope to see you on the air.</p>
