(A &#34;dumpster,&#34; by the way, is the American word for the big metal garbage bin that is called a &#34;skip&#34; in the UK and Australia. Also it&#39;s been a few years since I wrote this, and now I do almost no dumpster diving because I&#39;m based in Spokane where all the stores have trash compactors. Even in Seattle it seems like the best ones have dried up, but probably there are new good ones that I don&#39;t know about.)</p></div>
