            <p>These weeks are passing by faster and faster. I too would like to <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/speed-matters/?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">work faster</a>, but I didn&#39;t think vibe coding was going to be it. I work with AI everyday, and I mostly have it do basic debugging or explaining Python minutiae to me. I know what it&#39;s capable of. However, YC claims much of the code in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IACHfKmZMr8&amp;ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">current batch are being vibe coded</a> and when playing with Codebuff and Claude Code, I recognized it was a leap forward. I&#39;m always up for trying new ways to work, so I tried <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/lab-note-063-vibe-coding-a-scheduler/" rel="noreferrer">generating the scheduler</a>. It&#39;s cost me about a week and a half&#39;s worth of time, cleaning up and understanding what it did.</p><p>This week, I spent most of the time pushing on and cleaning up the scheduler. I found that there were a lot of minor design choices that I wouldn&#39;t have made on closer examination (and I wouldn&#39;t have made them for very specific reasons!) I still think AI-assisted programming is still valuable, but it&#39;s not going to be the panacea everyone makes it out to be, as impressive as it is. </p><p><a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/" rel="noreferrer">Simon Willison also clarified what Andrej Karparthy meant by vibe coding</a>–namely, that not all AI-assisted coding is vibe coding. </p><blockquote>There’s a new kind of coding I call “vibe coding”, where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and <strong>forget that the code even exists</strong>. It’s possible because the LLMs (e.g. Cursor Composer w Sonnet) are getting too good. Also I just talk to Composer with SuperWhisper so I barely even touch the keyboard.</blockquote><p>Vibe coding should be for when projects are low stakes, with low security requirements, and your money isn&#39;t on the line. But obviously, that&#39;s not what people are doing. A lot of people, both experience and novice programmers are accepting everything as it&#39;s generated. </p><figure><img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/content/images/2025/03/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="640" height="640" srcset="https://interjectedfuture.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/image-3.png 600w, https://interjectedfuture.com/content/images/2025/03/image-3.png 640w"/><figcaption><span>I think I saw this once in </span><a href="https://youtu.be/jF6RzK50fDs?si=teofW_ltMcarmngC&amp;t=175&amp;ref=interjectedfuture.com"><span>Job Simulator</span></a><span>.</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI-assisted programming isn&#39;t going away, and it&#39;ll be what most people call vibe coding, despite its original intent and definition. But I think the human still needs to drive the process. Abdicating direction and responsibility will look like it works in the beginning for a little bit, and all the incentives might be to just ship what kinda works in the name of speed and product market fit. But I suspect this will be just a different kind of technical debt that people will find when the chickens come home to roost.</p><p>The thing I&#39;m wrestling with right now is how to indicate when something is an async computation. The obvious choice is native async/await, but I had hesitated on doing so because:</p><ol><li>I wanted to be able to cancel long-running async promise, and in Javascript you couldn&#39;t.</li><li>I wanted to leave room in my design for <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/can-you-enable-multiple-resumption-by-implementing-your-own-call-stack/" rel="noreferrer">multiple-resumption in my algebraic effects</a>. This was really the whole reason for embarking on a scheduler in the first place.</li><li>I didn&#39;t think people would find an enforced async to be intuitive for a computational graph.</li></ol><p>But after turning this design space over and over, #3 might just be fine if I just tell people: &#34;hey this is an async computational graph, because it supports async effects&#34;. And it turns out #1 is false because in Python, you can cancel futures (its name for promises).</p><p>So I&#39;m left with a couple options.</p><ol><li>Every reactive function returns a wrapped type <em>ReactiveValue[T]</em>. This is like using a <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/how-the-free-monad-and-functors-represent-syntax/" rel="noreferrer">Free Monad to construct a description of the computation</a>. But that leaves a lot of work to work out how to compose these things together.</li><li>Use <code>with</code> and write a kind of &#34;do-notation&#34; for waiting for async values to resolve. This is like just re-implementing await all over again.</li><li>Go with the native async/await.</li></ol><p>It&#39;s impossible to make it completely transparent, short of writing my own language, because the fundamental assumption in program evaluation for most any language is that you can&#39;t intercept a call to a function and suspend that execution–unless it&#39;s awaited. And perhaps you want that distinction, so users are aware, just as they need to be aware of what effects are being raised for controlled state manipulation.</p><p>Given everything, I&#39;m leaning more towards #3, despite having sunk-costs. The original reasons for embarking on a custom scheduler seem less compelling, now that I&#39;ve learned more. Futures are cancelable, async reactive computation isn&#39;t such bad UX if you tell devs up front, and multiple resumptions isn&#39;t currently a hard requirement.</p><p>The only current application for multiple resumption is a simpler handler for websocket pushes. So I can&#39;t quite justify this direction any longer. Psychologically, I&#39;ll have to take the loss, and tell myself to take the longer view. Look, there&#39;s other hard problems already visible, and you don&#39;t need the win on this one. The longer you fight it, the more time will be lost.</p><p>Here&#39;s the interesting links that I looked at this week.</p><ul><li>Continued learning all about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUQ0mmbIdxs&amp;list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_&amp;index=13&amp;ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">bifunctors</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REqRzMI26Nw&amp;list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_&amp;index=15&amp;ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">function objects and exponentials</a> in category theory. </li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcVA8Nj6HEo&amp;ref=interjectedfuture.com">What is PLUS times PLUS?</a> In my post on <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/visual-programming-is-stuck-on-the-form/" rel="noreferrer">visual programming</a>, I was looking for that visualization of lambda calculus, but couldn&#39;t remember the name. This week, I found someone made an explainer video on Tromp Diagrams.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4poHENv4kR0&amp;list=PLSdFiFTAI4sQ0Rg4BIZcNnU-45I9DI-VB&amp;ref=interjectedfuture.com">Categories for AI 1: Why Category Theory?</a> A light intro explainer on a category theory course. The thing interesting here was the Optics category that helps with bidirectionality. I&#39;d run into it in <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/cambria/?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">Cambria</a> for schema migrations, but I think it might help for visual programming UI as well, so that you can edit the code and change the visuals or vice versa. In addition, it mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheaf_(mathematics)?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">sheaves</a>, and hints that it&#39;s a way to help understand how global effects arise from local effects. This <em>seems</em> related to <a href="https://www.santafe.edu/what-is-complex-systems-science?ref=interjectedfuture.com" rel="noreferrer">complex systems</a>, but I&#39;m not sure...</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTSQlYX5DU0&amp;ref=interjectedfuture.com">React 2014 : What does it mean to be Reactive?</a> Erik Meijer frames the push and pull of reactive systems as a type system. Super interesting given what I&#39;m doing right now. Maybe I should revisit this despite declaring on giving up on the scheduler. 🤔</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xAaVZD8hpQ&amp;ref=interjectedfuture.com">What is a (side) effect?</a> A pondering on what side effects are. I thought of it differently after this talk.</li></ul>
