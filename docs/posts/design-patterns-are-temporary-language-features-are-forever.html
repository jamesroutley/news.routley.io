    <h1>Design Patterns Are Temporary, Language Features Are Forever</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>Design patterns are these cool things that make you go &#39;hell yeah&#39; because they make a certain problem easier to deal with. Whether it&#39;s applicable to all languages, or due to a language constraint, they&#39;re pretty nice. Of course, some people go crazy with them rather than doing the simple thing that works. Other times, you&#39;ll naturally do a design pattern without even knowing about it.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, I like to go through design patterns that are &#39;commonly applicable&#39; to Java as a thought experiment to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have I seen this in a codebase before?</li>
<li>Does this look like something that would&#39;ve helped me with before?</li>
<li>Is this a solution to a problem which doesn&#39;t exist?</li>
</ul>
<p>and so on.</p>
<p>A few times I have come across patterns such as &#39;visitor&#39; and never truly grasped what it was solving, or why I would use it. Young Joel was unsure, probably due to poor explanations, which I think can be a big problem when it comes to concepts today. In jiujitsu, it&#39;s extremely evident when a concept or a technique is practical and not bullshido (if you go to a gym which competes at least in my anecdotal experience). But for the visitor pattern, explanations to me have always been:</p>
<p>&gt;&#34;here&#39;s how the pattern works&#34;</p>
<p>&gt;just randomly logs stuff</p>
<p>Not exactly helpful presenting how to use &#39;x&#39; with an unrealistic use case.</p>
