He was interested in music from an early age and began learning the guitar aged seven.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I always used to get a musical instrument either for Christmas or on my birthday, so I went through plastic trumpets, saxophone, keyboard - I tried a bit of everything,&#34; <a href="https://wayoutradio.wordpress.com/2016/04/18/an-interview-with-andy-rourke-the-smiths/">Rourke said in a 2016 interview.</a></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I played a bit of cello later on, but I made that up as I went along because it was needed on a Smiths record so I just bought one, tuned it up like a bass and went from there.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He struck up a friendship with Marr aged 11. &#34;We were best friends, going everywhere together. When we were 15, I moved into his house with him and his three brothers and I soon came to realise that my mate was one of those rare people that absolutely no one doesn&#39;t like,&#34; Marr recalled.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Marr and Rourke formed a band called Freak Party but did not release any music. In 1982, when Marr formed The Smiths with Morrissey and Joyce, the group initially trialled two other bassists before permanently enlisting Rourke. Marr described playing the bass as Rourke&#39;s &#34;true calling&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The group became the defining Manchester act of the 1980s and an icon of British alternative rock, with hits including Heaven Knows I&#39;m Miserable Now and Girlfriend in a Coma.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Riaz Gomez</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Johnny Marr (left) and Andy Rourke became friends aged 11 and maintained their friendship over decades</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Rourke was briefly sacked for two weeks in 1986 for taking heroin, but returned to record The Queen Is Dead album later that the same year. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In 1989, Rourke and Joyce took Morrissey and Marr to court, arguing they were owed an equal share of earnings, having only earned 10% each of the group&#39;s performance and recording royalties. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Rourke settled for a lump sum of £83,000, but Joyce persisted with the legal action and was awarded around £1m in backdated royalties, and 25% thereafter. Rourke later filed for bankruptcy in 1999.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But, Marr said: &#34;We maintained our friendship over the years, no matter where we were or what was happening</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Andy reinvented what it is to be a bass guitar player. Watching him play those dazzling basslines was an absolute privilege and genuinely something to behold.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Later in his career, Rourke became a radio presenter on the radio station then known as XFM.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/billybragg/status/1659479104758882304">Singer Billy Bragg tweeted:</a> &#34;Very sorry to hear that Smiths bassist Andy Rourke has passed away. I have great memories of him playing with Johnny Marr and myself on the Red Wedge tour. He was a lovely guy and an amazing bass player. My condolences to his family and friends.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Presenter <a href="https://twitter.com/terrychristian/status/1659471873506177025">Terry Christian described Rourke</a> as a &#34;lovely guy&#34;, adding: &#34;Another hole left In the history of Manchester music.&#34;</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The Smiths, pictured performing in 1984, were the defining Manchester act of the decade</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Burgess/status/1659466791519674370">The Charlatans singer Tim Burgess added:</a> &#34;Such sad sad news about Andy Rourke - he was an inspirational musician, with a style that made so many of us pick up a bass guitar; and the driving force for [benefit concert] Manchester Versus Cancer. Our thoughts are with everyone who knew him. Travel well x.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Music journalist and fellow bassist John Robb told BBC Radio 5 Live: &#34;In Manchester, because it&#39;s such a tightly-knit musical scene and musical family, it feels like you&#39;ve lost someone from your family. You feel like you&#39;ve lost one of your own. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;[Rourke&#39;s] talent, you have to celebrate it. He was a kind and beautiful man. He was one of those people who&#39;s good to be in the company of. He was affable, gentle, kind spirit. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;But his basslines were so key to The Smiths. They were melodic - driving the songs along. He was the melodic spine to those songs and really made those songs.&#34;</p></div></article></main></div></div>
