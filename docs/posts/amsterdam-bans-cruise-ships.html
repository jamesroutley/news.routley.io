A 2021 study of one big cruise ship found that <a href="https://ce.nl/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CE_Delft_210101_Emissions_of_the_Marella_Discovery_Def.pdf">it had produced the same levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in one day as 30,000 trucks</a>.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Other mooring sites away from the city centre have been under consideration for some time but no decision has yet been taken.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In a separate development, Amsterdam has announced plans to beef up night-time culture for young people. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><a href="https://www.amsterdam.nl/nieuws/nieuwsoverzicht/miljoen-nacht/">The city has outlined its aim</a> to find nightclub locations such as disused tunnels and garages to develop the talent of &#34;creative young people who want to organise something at night&#34;.</p></div></article></div></div>
