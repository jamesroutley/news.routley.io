        <div><h2 data-block-key="iodg0">Try Android XR on the new Galaxy XR</h2><p data-block-key="61hc5">Galaxy XR gives you an infinite screen to explore your apps, with Gemini by your side. It lets you switch between being fully immersed in a virtual environment and staying present in the real world, and you can navigate the interface naturally with your voice, hands and eyes.</p><p data-block-key="7n2pa">Since it’s Android, you can fill its infinite screen with your favorite apps from Google Play. You can access Google apps that have been reimagined for XR, totally new experiences made for Android XR by developers, and millions of mobile and tablet apps, including:</p><ul><li data-block-key="2euk4">Apps from top streaming services like Crunchyroll, HBO Max, Peacock, and more</li><li data-block-key="d5df1">New versions of Google Maps, Google Photos, YouTube, Google TV, Chrome and Meet.</li><li data-block-key="2g94p">Immersive games from studios like Mirrorscape, Owlchemy Labs, and Resolution Games.</li><li data-block-key="do1i8">Over 50 new experiences made for XR from Adobe, Calm, Fox Sports, MLB and more</li></ul><p data-block-key="2mfct">And because Android XR is built on open standards with support for tools like OpenXR, WebXR, and Unity, even more innovative content is on the way.</p><p data-block-key="7pv7v">But what makes this experience truly transformative is that Gemini is built for it. On Galaxy XR, Gemini Live can better understand what you’re seeing and doing, making it easier to get the help you need or take action on your behalf across your apps — with just a conversation.</p><p data-block-key="4cjd4">Here’s three examples of how Galaxy XR opens up new ways to watch, explore and create:</p></div>

        <div><h2 data-block-key="iodg0">Enjoy movies and memories</h2><p data-block-key="ctjel">When it’s time to unwind, the Galaxy XR turns any room into your private theater. With YouTube, you can dive into the world’s largest library of immersive 180 and 360-degree VR content, or check out the new spatial tab for content that creators have converted to 3D. You can also kick back and watch movies in Google TV on a massive, resizable screen.</p><p data-block-key="8v8j5">With Google Photos, you can convert your entire existing library of 2D photos and videos into 3D, letting you step into your memories.<br/></p><p data-block-key="1v761">As you&#39;re watching videos, viewing photos, or playing games, Gemini is ready to help. For example, if you&#39;re catching up on basketball highlights, you can just ask about the stats of a player on-screen. Gemini understands what you’re seeing and gets you the info in real time.</p></div>
