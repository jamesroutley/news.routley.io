<p>Just got word that the<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69221176/169/wpengine-inc-v-automattic-inc/"> court dismissed several of WP Engine and Silver Lake’s most serious claims</a> — antitrust, monopolization, and extortion have been knocked out! These were by far the most significant and far-reaching allegations in the case and with today’s decision the case is narrowed significantly. This is a win not just for us but for all open source maintainers and contributors. Huge thanks to the folks at <a href="https://www.gibsondunn.com/">Gibson</a> and <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> who have been working on this.</p>



<p>With respect to any remaining claims, we’re confident the facts will demonstrate that our actions were lawful and in the best interests of the WordPress community.</p>



<p>This ruling is a significant milestone, but our focus remains the same: building a free, open, and thriving WordPress ecosystem and supporting the millions of people who rely on it every day. </p>
