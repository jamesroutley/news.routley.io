    <h1>Ask HN: What is the morale like inside Reddit, as an employee?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m curious if anyone who works for Reddit might want to chime in anonymously or give insight. Is this going to turn out like Twitter with a huge purge of Reddit staff too, Spez said he wanted to do to Reddit what Elon did to Twitter.</p><p>As an employee do you support the blackout secretly? What is your opinion of things? Some huge subs have migrated to other platforms, how do you think this ends?</p></div></div></div>
