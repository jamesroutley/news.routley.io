    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><b>Bonus</b></p><p>Adjustments &amp; Bargaining</p><p>If you used separate funds to pay for something relating to marital property (e.g. paying the mortgage on a property you owned together) , you could for example, claim more of the marital property to offset your separate property contribution.</p><p>Under the same guidelines, if marital funds (e.g. income earned while married) were used on a separate property, a portion of this may be owed to the other spouse (who doesnâ€™t own the separate property). This can be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.</p></div></div>
