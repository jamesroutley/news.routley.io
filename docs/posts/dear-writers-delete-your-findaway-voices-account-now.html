    <h1>Dear writers: Delete your Findaway Voices account NOW</h1>

		<p>When Findaway Voices first appeared, it made it comparatively easy for independent authors to do audiobooks. Audio was still hard, mind you, but it was possible.</p>
<p>Spotify bought Findaway. They began playing with payments, refunds, and returns. And now, the <a href="https://my.findawayvoices.com/terms-of-use">licensing terms have changed</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Accordingly, you hereby grant Spotify a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid, irrevocable, worldwide license to reproduce, make available, perform and display, translate, modify, create derivative works from (such as transcripts of User Content), distribute, and otherwise use any such User Content through any medium, whether alone or in combination with other Content or materials, in any manner and by any means, method or technology, whether now known or hereafter created, in connection with the Service, the promotion, advertising or marketing of the Service, and the operation of Spotify’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including for systems and products management, improvement and development, testing, training, modeling and implementation in connection with the Spotify Service. Where applicable and to the extent permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive, and not to enforce, any “moral rights” or equivalent rights, such as your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content. Nothing in these Terms prohibits any use of User Content by Spotify that may be taken without a license.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Spotify may now do anything they want with your audiobook. They will–not can, <em>will</em>–feed it to their AI system and use it to rip off your work. They specifically declare you can’t complain about derogatory uses. They can mix your book with work you find abhorrent and release it as a new product. They can use a speech recognition system and create a printed version of your book.</p>
<p>I have one audiobook. I pulled it from distribution when the royalties problems started and I stopped getting paid. <a href="https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com/product/audiosbs/">That audiobook became exclusive to my store on 17 January 2023</a>. It has fewer sales, but I’ve made more than I did in all the years before. (“But exposure,” some folks will say. People die of exposure.)</p>
<p>It’s not enough to stop distributing your work via Findaway. If you use them to store your audio files and nothing else, the new terms apply. They have no automatic option to delete titles from their site. I just sent this email to their technical support.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Findaway’s new terms of service are unacceptable. Please delete my</p>
<p>Thank you.
</p></blockquote>
<p>No need to be rude. It’s not the tech support flunky’s fault.</p>
<p>Also, I’m super happy with how my one lone audiobook came out. If it sold more, I’d do more.</p>
