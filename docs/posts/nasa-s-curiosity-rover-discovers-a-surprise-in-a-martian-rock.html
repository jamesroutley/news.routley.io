    <h1>NASA&#39;s Curiosity rover discovers a surprise in a Martian rock</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p data-block-key="833vq">“This was not a quiet period on Mars,” said Becky Williams, a scientist with the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and the deputy principal investigator of Curiosity’s Mast Camera, or <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/science-instruments/#h-mastcam">Mastcam</a>. “There was an exciting amount of activity here. We’re looking at multiple flows down the channel, including energetic floods and boulder-rich flows.”</p><h3 data-block-key="b1o8c"><b>A Hole in 41</b></h3><p data-block-key="1fo2c">All this evidence of water continues to tell a more complex story than the team’s early expectations, and they’ve been eager to take a rock sample from the channel in order to learn more. On June 18, they got their chance.</p><p data-block-key="4nqk2">While the sulfur rocks were too small and brittle to be sampled with the drill, a large rock nicknamed “Mammoth Lakes” was spotted nearby. Rover engineers had to search for a part of the rock that would allow safe drilling and find a parking spot on the loose, sloping surface.</p><p data-block-key="69md5">After Curiosity bored its 41st hole using the powerful drill at the end of the rover’s 7-foot (2-meter) robotic arm, the six-wheeled scientist trickled the powderized rock into instruments inside its belly for further analysis so that scientists can determine what materials the rock is made of.</p><p data-block-key="28kmt">Curiosity has since <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/blogs/sols-4236-4238-one-more-time-for-contact-science-at-mammoth-lakes/">driven away from Mammoth Lakes</a> and is now off to see what other surprises are waiting to be discovered within the channel.</p><h3 data-block-key="1ntcr"><b>More About the Mission</b></h3><p data-block-key="a89km">Curiosity was built by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which is managed by Caltech in Pasadena, California. JPL leads the mission on behalf of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington.</p><p data-block-key="23pss">For more about Curiosity, visit:</p><p data-block-key="fo00b"><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity">science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity</a></p></div></div></div></div>
