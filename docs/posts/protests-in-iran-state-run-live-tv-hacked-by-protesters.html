The 22-year-old Iranian Kurd died in custody on 16 September, three days after her arrest.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Her death has sparked an unprecedented wave of protest across the country.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Saturday&#39;s TV news bulletin at 21:00 (17:30 GMT) was interrupted with images which included Iran&#39;s supreme leader with a target on his head, photos of Ms Amini and three other women killed in recent protests. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>One of the captions read &#34;join us and rise up&#34;, whilst another said &#34;our youths&#39; blood is dripping off your paws&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The interruption lasted only a few seconds before being cut off. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Such displays of rebellion against Ayatollah Ali Khamenei are historically rare, and he wields almost complete power within Iran. But following Ms Amini&#39;s death, there has been widespread open dissent.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Also on Saturday, social media videos emerged which seemed to show female students at a university in Tehran chanting &#34;get lost&#34; during a visit by President Ebrahim Raisi.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Earlier in the day, two people were killed in Sanandaj, including a man shot in his car after he sounded his horn in support of protesters. A video shared online also showed a woman shot in the neck lying unconscious on the ground in Mashhad.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In Sanandaj, a police official said a man had been killed by &#34;counter-revolutionaries&#34;, the state-run news agency IRNA reported.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On Friday, Iran&#39;s Forensic Medicine Organisation said Ms Amini had died from multiple organ failure caused by cerebral hypoxia - and not from blows to the head, as her family and protesters contend.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Rights groups say more than 150 people have been killed since the protests in the Islamic Republic began on 17 September.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Shops in several cities have shut in support of the protesters, including in Tehran&#39;s bazaar where some set fire to a police kiosk and chased the security forces away. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The protests reaching the bazaar in Tehran will ring alarm bells with Iranian leaders who have counted the merchants as among their supporters.</p></div><div data-component="video-block"><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Watch: The protests currently sweeping the country have their roots in changes made after the 1979 revolution</p></figcaption></figure></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
