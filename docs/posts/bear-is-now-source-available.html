    <p>When I started building Bear I made the code available under an <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit" target="_blank">MIT license</a>. I didn&#39;t give it much thought at the time, but knew that I wanted the code to be available for people to learn from, and to make it easily auditable so users could validate claims I have made about the privacy and security of the platform.</p>
<p>Unfortunately over the years there have been cases of people forking the project in the attempt to set up a competing service. And it hurts. It hurts to see something you&#39;ve worked so hard on for so long get copied and distributed with only a few hours of modification. It hurts to have poured so much love into a piece of software to see it turned against you and threaten your livelihood. It hurts to believe in open-source and then be bitten by it.</p>
<p>After the last instance of this I have come to the difficult decision to change Bear&#39;s license from MIT to a version of copyleft called the Elastic Licenseâ€”created by the Elastic Search people.</p>
<p>This license is almost identical to the MIT license but with the stipulation that the software cannot be provided as a hosted or managed service. You can view the specific wording <a href="https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/blob/master/LICENSE.md" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>After spending time researching how other projects are handling this, I realise I&#39;m not alone. Many other open-source projects have updated their licenses to prevent &#34;free-ride competition&#34; in the past few years.<sup><a href="https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-licenses" target="_blank">1</a><a href="https://github.com/usefathom/fathom" target="_blank">2</a><a href="https://grafana.com/blog/2021/04/20/grafana-loki-tempo-relicensing-to-agplv3/" target="_blank">3</a><a href="https://snowplow.io/blog/introducing-snowplow-limited-use-license" target="_blank">4</a><a href="https://www.scylladb.com/2024/12/18/why-were-moving-to-a-source-available-license/" target="_blank">5</a><a href="https://blog.sentry.io/introducing-the-functional-source-license-freedom-without-free-riding/" target="_blank">6</a></sup></p>
<p>We&#39;re entering a new age of AI powered coding, where creating a competing product only involves typing &#34;Create a fork of this repo and change its name to something cool and deploy it on an EC2 instance&#34;.</p>
<p>While Bear&#39;s code is good, what makes the platform special is the <a href="https://bearblog.dev/discover/" target="_blank">people who use it</a>, and the <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/manifesto/" target="_blank">commitment to longevity</a>.</p>
<p>I will ensure the platform is taken care of, even if it means backtracking on what people can do with the code itself.</p>
