<p><img alt="Cartoon mastodon tossing paper airplane with its trunk" height="194" src="https://www.w3.org/media/images/mastodon-elephant.width-500.png" width="253"/></p><p data-block-key="r0ct">I do wish that Mastodon&#39;s migration tools also included a built-in way to migrate all my posts to the new account; they don&#39;t, so my old posts remain on Mastodon.social, and I exported them to have a local backup. Also, I could not download an archive of my favorites (posts by others that I had fave-starred), but I could download an archive of my bookmarks, so I worked around that by looking at my favorites and bookmarking them all, then downloading that archive.</p><h2 data-block-key="3glot">Reasons to use, and to move from, Mastodon.social</h2><p data-block-key="2csqi">In the past few weeks, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63539246">Twitter&#39;s shown signs of business and technical instability</a>. And <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/11/08/1062886/heres-how-a-twitter-engineer-says-it-will-break-in-the-coming-weeks/">will probably develop more</a>. So a lot of people are joining the Fediverse, and the easiest Mastodon instance to find has been the famous one, Mastodon.social -- it doesn&#39;t charge you money to be a user, and it&#39;s a general-interest place for all geographies, so it&#39;s immediately appealing as a starting place.</p><p data-block-key="f9ea">But. Since so many people joined Mastodon.social recently, you may have to cope with some performance problems. <a href="https://ar.al/2022/11/09/is-the-fediverse-about-to-get-fryed-or-why-every-toot-is-also-a-potential-denial-of-service-attack/">One blogger points out some technical reasons why a single big instance is a single point of failure when popular people engage in a lot of conversation.</a> As the instance suffers slowdowns and timeouts and glitches, one way to remediate is to throw money at more cloud computing resources. But will the money be available? Quite a lot of the people coming to Mastodon.social are used to cost-free platforms like Twitter, and it seems unlikely to me that voluntary donations from a small fraction of them will cover increased costs, so maintenance and performance will suffer.</p><p data-block-key="crvem">And, since the big wave of new Mastodon.social users includes some really unpleasant-to-deal-with people, and since Mastodon.social doesn&#39;t have a lot of hands-on moderation to dissuade the unpleasant folks, some other instances are talking about &#34;defederating&#34; from Mastodon.social, at least temporarily. That would mean that, if your account is on Mastodon.social, folks on other servers would be less likely to get/read your posts, and you&#39;d have a harder time reading/getting theirs too.</p><p data-block-key="8tfd3">If you just made your first Mastodon account and it&#39;s on Mastodon.social, and you want to avoid getting caught in the ripple effects of the dynamics I just described, I suggest you move to a different instance (server). I of course like social.coop, but you can use <a href="https://instances.social/">https://instances.social/</a> to browse instances and choose one that suits you. I like <a href="https://hub.fosstodon.org/longevity-and-fosstodon/">Fosstodon.org&#39;s clear explanation of their sustainability plans</a>.</p><p data-block-key="9v73f">Treat mastodon.social like the general &#34;lobby&#34; that America On-Line chat threw users into when they first joined. A place to start.</p><p data-block-key="efnro">And, wherever you are in the Fediverse, come <a href="https://social.coop/@brainwane/109317543871159400">visit my thread about fanciful feelings about square numbers</a>, where we&#39;re having silly fun.</p>
