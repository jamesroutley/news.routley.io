    <h1>Sora Update #1</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_2228126">
    
      <div><p>We have been learning quickly from how people are using Sora and taking feedback from users, rightsholders, and other interested groups. We of course spent a lot of time discussing this before launch, but now that we have a product out we can do more than just theorize.</p><p>We are hearing from a lot of rightsholders who are very excited for this new kind of &#34;interactive fan fiction&#34; and think this new kind of engagement will accrue a lot of value to them, but want the ability to specify how their characters can be used (including not at all). We assume different people will try very different approaches and will figure out what works for them. But we want to apply the same standard towards everyone, and let rightsholders decide how to proceed (our aim of course is to make it so compelling that many people want to). There may be some edge cases of generations that get through that shouldn&#39;t, and getting our stack to work well will take some iteration.Â </p><p>Please expect a very high rate of change from us; it reminds me of the early days of ChatGPT. We will make some good decisions and some missteps, but we will take feedback and try to fix the missteps very quickly. We plan to do our iteration on different approaches in Sora, but then apply it consistently across our products.<br/></p></div>
