        The voices of the everyday people that wait to cross the street, honk their horns,
        drink coffee on benches, and carry in their groceries are critical in every 
        community&#39;s mission to build a successful city.</p> <p>This project&#39;s goal is to help those voices be heard.</p></section> <section>   <ul><a href="https://littlefixes.xyz/city/san-francisco"><li>San Francisco</li></a><a href="https://littlefixes.xyz/city/palo-alto"><li>Palo Alto</li></a><a href="https://littlefixes.xyz/city/boston"><li>Boston</li></a><a href="https://littlefixes.xyz/city/homer-ak"><li>Homer, AK</li></a></ul> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-u570ty">Don&#39;t see your city?

She told me
            that she needed to go to the store, didn&#39;t have a car that day, and didn&#39;t
            feel safe walking along the street, so she was taking the ditch, knee-high
            weeds and all. I observed the well-worn path she was treading and realized
            this was a struggle being shared with others.</p> <p>I met an elderly woman going down the street using a walker, climbing 
            over mounds of snow left by the snowplow. She told me she had no 
            choice but to get to the pharmacy that day. She pointed out that the
            street was cleared of snow but the sidewalk wasn&#39;t, so she was walking
            where she had to.</p> <p>...</p> <p>[These] are the kind of thing people accept, the gradually diminishing
                expectations of a long decline.</p></div> </blockquote></section></div></div>
