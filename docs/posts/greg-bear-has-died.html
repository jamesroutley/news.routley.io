<p>Five-time Nebula winner Greg Bear died November 19, a week after heart surgery from which he never awoke. A CT scan showed stroke damage was caused to many parts of the brain by clots that had been hiding in a false lumen of the anterior artery to the brain ever since an earlier surgery eight years ago. After a review of the possible outcomes by the medical team, and following the wishes expressed in his advance directive, Bear was taken off life support and died two hours later.</p>



<p>The author of over 50 books, Bear’s novels won Nebulas for <em>Moving Mars </em>(1995) and <em>Darwin’s Radio. </em>Three other works of short fiction won Nebulas, and two of those – “Blood Music” (1984) and “Tangents” (1987) — also won the Hugo.</p>



<p>Bear’s writing was very successful in translation, too. He twice won Japan’s Seiun Award, as well as the Ignotus Award (Spain), and Prix Apollo (France). Altogether his works have been translated into 19 languages.</p>



<p>Bear sold his first short story, “Destroyers”, to <em>Famous Science Fiction</em> at age 15, and along with high-school friends helped found San Diego Comic-Con.</p>



<p>He also published work as an artist at the beginning of his career, including illustrations for an early version of the <em>Star Trek Concordance,</em> and covers for <em>Galaxy</em> and <em>F&amp;SF</em>. He was a founding member of the Association of Science Fiction Artists. He even created the cover for his novel, <em>Psychlone</em>, a 1988 reprint from Tor.</p>
