			<h3>About MicTests.com</h3>

<p>This website provides a simple online mic test that allows you to check if microphone is working properly. Since it’s a browser microphone test, you don’t have to download or install any third-party software. Moreover, even if it may seem too simple, <strong>MicTests.Com</strong> will test your microphone regardless of its type or the device and operating system you are using. And to surprise you even more, this mic test will display a lot of useful information about your microphone (for example, its name, number of audio channels, latency, sample size and sample rate, as well as if it supports echo cancellation or noise suppression). In addition, if the tester will detect any problems with your microphone, you will receive tips on how to fix them.</p></div>
