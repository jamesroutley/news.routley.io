    <h1>FSF40 Hackathon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="parent-fieldname-text-ceef094de6ac4f3b9ef27b075f59b4bc">
            <p>When we first announced plans to celebrate the Free Software Foundation&#39;s (FSF) fortieth anniversary, we promised to do so in the spirit of bringing the international free software community together. On November 21--23, we invite you to participate in a global, online hackathon to help improve important libre software projects. It&#39;s at the core of the FSF&#39;s mission to foster free software development. With this hackathon, we want to spotlight the indispensable and hard work free software hackers are carrying out in the background, often without being seen and valued enough.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://my.fsf.org/civicrm/event/info?reset=1&amp;id=134">Register now</a> to participate in the FSF40 hackathon.</strong> </p>
<h3>Participating projects</h3>
<p>Here is the list of projects so far that have declared that they will 
participate in the FSF40 hackathon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t track bugs: track valuable discussions, a tool to help 
   contributors track bugs, patches, featured requests, and other 
   valuable discussions shared on mailing lists;<br/>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Main_Page">Free Software Directory</a>, the FSF&#39;s free software catalog; </li>
<li><a href="https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gnuboot/">GNU Boot</a>, a boot software distribution that can replace 
   nonfree boot software like BIOS or UEFI on specific computers; </li>
<li><a href="https://guix.gnu.org/">GNU Guix</a>, a reproducible package manager;<br/>
</li>
<li>Lewa, an interactive platform to learn African writing systems; <br/>
</li>
<li>LibreVR, a project working on ethical replacements for nonfree VR 
   games;</li>
<li>op-mattermost, OpenProject integration for Mattermost; and<br/>
</li>
<li><a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org Mode</a>, the notes management and organizer for GNU Emacs.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You don&#39;t need to be a developer to participate in the FSF40 hackathon. There will be tasks for all kinds of interests and every experience level. 
In addition to advancing the 
participating projects, the goal of this hackathon is also to learn from each other, acquire skills, and sharpen 
them. Adding entries to the <a href="https://directory.fsf.org/wiki/Main_Page">Free Software Directory</a>, for example, 
is a dedicated exercise to deepen the understanding of licenses and 
how to codify software freedom. GNU Boot and op-mattermost are 
actively looking for non-developers to help write and improve 
documentation that can be understood by anyone.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you have any of the following skills, your experience could be very 
helpful for the following hackathon projects: <br/>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic knowledge of JavaScript, Node.js, Mocka, Chai, and Sinon is 
   ideal for op-mattermost;  <br/>
</li>
<li>Basic Python and web development skills for Lewa; <br/>
</li>
<li>Emacs Lisp hacking experience for Org Mode; and<br/>
</li>
<li>Understanding of DIY hardware, which is welcome but not necessary 
   for LibreVR.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Participation</h3>
<p>You can either choose to participate in the hackathon as an individual or as 
a team consisting of up to four people. To team up, just state 
in the Libera.chat IRC channel #fsf-hackathon that you&#39;re looking 
for fellow team members to work on one of the projects together.<br/>
</p>
<p>Upon registration, you&#39;ll be asked to specify one or two projects you would like to contribute to 
during the hackathon. Registration is gratis, but <a href="https://donate.fsf.org/">donations</a> are encouraged and will 
support the FSF&#39;s work as well as the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU operating system</a>, which 
the FSF sponsors. You can also choose to <a href="https://my.fsf.org/civicrm/contribute/transact?reset=1&amp;id=50">donate to GNU Guix</a> 
through the FSF&#39;s <a href="https://www.fsf.org/working-together/fund">Working Together for Free Software Fund</a>.</p>
<p>We will award prizes to participants who have not contributed 
to a free software package before and a team that includes at least 
one new free software contributor, as well as for diverse and 
inclusive teams. On top of these prizes, a jury will award a prize for 
the most impactful contribution made during the hackathon. </p>
<p>We&#39;re also happy to hand out a certificate that 
acknowledges the work you&#39;ve accomplished during the hackathon, which can then serve as a valuable reference for job applications.</p>
<p>We encourage contributions to free software projects any time 
but, for fairness, only work accomplished between November 21, 10:00 EST (15:00 UTC) and 
November 23, 10:00 EST (15:00 UTC) will be considered for the awards. 
If you will need to work on submissions in shifted timezones, please 
request an exception upon registration.</p>
<p>Any code that is part of a hackathon contribution must be free 
software and may only be produced with free software.</p>
<p>Before registering, please carefully read the hackathon <a href="https://www.fsf.org/fsf40/hackathon/terms-and-conditions">terms and conditions</a>.<br/>
