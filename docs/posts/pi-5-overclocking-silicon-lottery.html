    <h1>Pi 5 overclocking: Silicon Lottery</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Silicon lottery</em>.</p>

<p>Now that the Raspberry Pi 5s been readily available (at least in <em>most</em> regions) for a few months, more people started messing with clocks, trying to get the most speed possible out of their Pi 5s.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" alt="Argon THRML Tower Cooler installed on Raspberry Pi 5 for Overclocking test" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-5-argon-thrml-tower-cooler.jpg"/></p>

<p>Unlike the Pi 4, the Pi 5 is typically comfortable at 2.6 or even 2.8 GHz, and some Pi 5s can hit 3.0 GHz (but no higher—more on why tomorrow).</p>

<p>After some testing, I found the <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/overclocking-and-underclocking-raspberry-pi-5">default 2.4 GHz clock on the Pi 5 is pretty much the efficiency sweet spot</a>, and after a <em>lot</em> more testing recently, I can confirm that&#39;s still the case, testing a number of Pi 5 samples.</p>

<p>Also unlike the Pi 4, the Pi 5&#39;s not very picky about cooling. While the chip runs a little hotter, it doesn&#39;t need exotic cooling like spraying ice, water cooling, or LN2, to run at its highest possible clock speeds. It does need <em>some</em> cooling, but I&#39;ve found the biggest factor affecting how fast your Pi 5 will go is the chip itself.</p>

<p>The <em>silicon lottery</em> basically states that among samples of the exact same silicon chip—in this case the BCM2712 at the heart of the Pi 5—there are variations affecting performance, thermals, etc.</p>

<p>These variations are almost imperceptible at the 2.4 GHz default clock Raspberry Pi chose for the board, but they can affect how fast your Pi 5 can go, no matter what cooling solution you use.</p>

<p>To prove that, over the past 5 months, I&#39;ve slowly acquired 10 Pi 5s from vendors around the world (1 at a time), to make sure they come from different batches, and I&#39;ve been testing overclocking performance on each. I also had another project slated for a number of these Pis (which I&#39;ll reveal tomorrow), but one thing I wanted to quantify is how many of the Pi 5s would hit 3.0 GHz.</p>

<p>And the answer? Out of the ten <em>I</em> bought, only one! It was an 8GB model (I did buy a few 4GB Pi 5s as well, since <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1854">the performance characteristics can be slightly different</a>, and it runs at 3 GHz reliably with <em>any</em> form of active cooling.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tested it with:</p>

<ul>
<li>Raspberry Pi&#39;s own Active Cooler</li>
<li>Argon THRML (a giant tower cooler for the Pi 5)</li>
<li>Argon Neo (a case with a larger heatsink and PWM fan for the Pi 5)</li>
<li>EDATEC Pi 5 Fanless Case (a top + bottom heatsink cover for the Pi 5)</li>
</ul>

<p>And in all cases, it worked fine.</p>

<p>I tested my other Pis with all those cooling solutions, and even tried a couple on my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/water-cooling-overkill-pi-5">massively-overkill water cooling setup</a>, and no matter what, none of them reached 3.0 GHz. The closest I got was 2.9 GHz on a couple of them. The rest maxed out at 2.8 GHz.</p>

<p>The result of that 3.0 GHz overclock? A marginally-improved <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/5297916">Geekbench 6 score of 1662</a>, versus <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/2808487">1507</a> with no OC. To achieve that 10% speedup, it ate up about 20% more power, so efficiency-wise, it&#39;s not worth it.</p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re <em>only</em> concerned about raw performance and efficiency, an RK3588-based SBC might be the better option regardless—it gives almost double the maximum performance, using about the same power! (notwithstanding software issues and vendor / community support.)</p>

<p>Bottom line: not every Pi 5 can achieve a 3.0 GHz overclock—in fact, in my testing, <em>most can&#39;t</em>. 2.4 GHz is the most efficient clock for the C0 BCM2712 silicon running on the Pi 5, at least based on my testing.</p>

<p>More on the Pi 5&#39;s silicon coming tomorrow—which happens to be Pi Day :)</p></div></div>
