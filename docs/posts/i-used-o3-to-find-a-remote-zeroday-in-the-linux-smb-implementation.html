I found the vulnerability with nothing more complicated than the o3 API – no scaffolding, no agentic frameworks, no tool use. </p>



<p>Recently I’ve been auditing ksmbd for vulnerabilities. ksmbd is “<em><a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.6/filesystems/smb/ksmbd.html">a linux kernel server which implements SMB3 protocol in kernel space for sharing files over network.</a></em>“. I started this project specifically to take a break from LLM-related tool development but after the release of o3 I couldn’t resist using the bugs I had found in ksmbd as a quick benchmark of o3’s capabilities. In a future post I’ll discuss o3’s performance across all of those bugs, but here we’ll focus on how o3 found a zeroday vulnerability during my benchmarking. The vulnerability it found is CVE-2025-37899 (fix <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/2fc9feff45d92a92cd5f96487655d5be23fb7e2b">here</a>), a use-after-free in the handler for the SMB ‘logoff’ command. Understanding the vulnerability requires reasoning about concurrent connections to the server, and how they may share various objects in specific circumstances. o3 was able to comprehend this and spot a location where a particular object that is not referenced counted is freed while still being accessible by another thread. As far as I’m aware, this is the first public discussion of a vulnerability of that nature being found by a LLM. </p>



<p>Before I get into the technical details, the main takeaway from this post is this: with o3 LLMs have made a leap forward in their ability to reason about code, and if you work in vulnerability research you should start paying close attention. If you’re an expert-level vulnerability researcher or exploit developer the machines aren’t about to replace you. In fact, it is quite the opposite: they are now at a stage where they can make you <em>significantly</em> more efficient and effective. If you have a problem that can be represented in fewer than 10k lines of code there is a reasonable chance o3 can either solve it, or help you solve it. </p>



<h2>Benchmarking o3 using CVE-2025-37778</h2>



<p>Lets first discuss CVE-2025-37778, a vulnerability that I found manually and which I was using as a benchmark for o3’s capabilities when it found the zeroday, CVE-2025-37899.  </p>



<p>CVE-2025-37778 is a use-after-free vulnerability. The issue occurs during the Kerberos authentication path when handling a “<em>session setup</em>” request from a remote client. To save us referring to CVE numbers, I will refer to this vulnerability as the “<em>kerberos authentication vulnerability</em>“.</p>



<p>The root cause looks as follows:</p>


<div><pre title="">static int krb5_authenticate(struct ksmbd_work *work,
			     struct smb2_sess_setup_req *req,
			     struct smb2_sess_setup_rsp *rsp)
{
...
	if (sess-&gt;state == SMB2_SESSION_VALID) 
		ksmbd_free_user(sess-&gt;user);
	
	retval = ksmbd_krb5_authenticate(sess, in_blob, in_len,
					 out_blob, &amp;out_len);
	if (retval) {
		ksmbd_debug(SMB, &#34;krb5 authentication failed\n&#34;);
		return -EINVAL;
	}
...
</pre></div>


<p>If <code>krb5_authenticate</code> detects that the session state is <code>SMB2_SESSION_VALID</code> then it frees <code>sess-&gt;user</code>. The assumption here appears to be that afterwards either <code>ksmbd_krb5_authenticate</code> will reinitialise it to a new valid value, or that after returning from <code>krb5_authenticate</code> with a return value of <code>-EINVAL</code> that <code>sess-&gt;user</code> will not be used elsewhere. As it turns out, this assumption is false. We can force <code>ksmbd_krb5_authenticate</code> to not reinitialise <code>sess-&gt;user</code>, and we can access <code>sess-&gt;user</code> even if <code>krb5_authenticate</code> returns <code>-EINVAL</code>.</p>



<p>This vulnerability is a nice benchmark for LLM capabilities as:</p>



<ol>
<li>It is interesting by virtue of being part of the remote attack surface of the Linux kernel.</li>



<li>It is not trivial as it requires:
<ul>
<li>(a) Figuring out how to get <code>sess-&gt;state == SMB2_SESSION_VALID</code> in order to trigger the free.</li>



<li>(b) Realising that there are paths in <code>ksmbd_krb5_authenticate</code> that do not reinitialise sess-&gt;user and reasoning about how to trigger those paths.</li>



<li>(c) Realising that there are other parts of the codebase that could potentially access <code>sess-&gt;user</code> after it has been freed.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>While it is not trivial, it is also not insanely complicated. I could walk a colleague through the entire code-path in 10 minutes, and you don’t really need to understand a lot of auxiliary information about the Linux kernel, the SMB protocol, or the remainder of ksmbd, outside of connection handling and session setup code. I calculated how much code you would need to read at a minimum if you read every ksmbd function called along the path from a packet arriving to the ksmbd module to the vulnerability being triggered, and it works out at about 3.3k LoC.</li>
</ol>



<p>OK, so we have the vulnerability we want to use for evaluation, now what code do we show the LLM to see if it can find it? My goal here is to evaluate how o3 would perform were it the backend for a hypothetical vulnerability detection system, so we need to ensure we have clarity on how such a system would generate queries to the LLM. In other words, it is no good arbitrary selecting functions to give to the LLM to look at if we can’t clearly describe how an automated system would select those functions. The <em>ideal</em> use of an LLM is we give it all the code from a repository, it ingests it and spits out results. However, due to context window limitations and regressions in performance that occur as the amount of context increases, this isn’t practically possible right now. </p>



<p>Instead, I thought one possible way that an automated tool could generate context for the LLM was through expansion of each SMB command handler individually. So, I gave the LLM the code for the ‘session setup’ command handler, including the code for all functions it calls, and so on, up to a call depth of 3 (this being the depth required to include all of the code necessary to reason about the vulnerability). I also include all of the code for the functions that read data off the wire, parses an incoming request, selects the command handler to run, and then tears down the connection after the handler has completed. Without this the LLM would have to guess at how various data structures were set up and that would lead to more false positives. In the end, this comes out at about 3.3k LoC (~27k tokens), and gives us a benchmark we can use to contrast o3 with prior models. If you’re interested, the code to be analysed is <a href="https://github.com/SeanHeelan/o3_finds_cve-2025-37899/blob/master/session_setup_code.prompt">here</a> as a single file, created with the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> tool.</p>



<p>The final decision is what prompt to use. You can find the system prompt and the other information I provided to the LLM in the .prompt files in <a href="https://github.com/SeanHeelan/o3_finds_cve-2025-37899">this</a> Github repository. The main points to note are:</p>



<ol>
<li>I told the LLM to look for use-after-free vulnerabilities.</li>



<li>I gave it a brief, high level overview of what ksmbd is, its architecture, and what its threat model is.</li>



<li>I tried to strongly guide it to not report false positives, and to favour not reporting any bugs over reporting false positives. I have no idea if this helps, but I’d like it to help, so here we are. In fact my entire system prompt is speculative in that I haven’t ran a sufficient number of evaluations to determine if it helps or hinders, so consider it equivalent to me saying a prayer, rather than anything resembling science or engineering. Once I have ran those evaluations I’ll let you know.  </li>
</ol>



<p>To run the query I then use the <code>llm</code> tool (<a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm">github</a>) like:  </p>



<pre>$ llm --sf system_prompt_uafs.prompt                \ </pre>



<p>My experiment harness executes this N times (N=100 for this particular experiment) and saves the results. It’s worth noting, if you rerun this you may not get <em>identical</em> results to me as between running the original experiment and writing this blog post I had removed the <a href="https://github.com/SeanHeelan/o3_finds_cve-2025-37899/blob/master/session_setup_code.prompt">file</a> containing the code to be analysed, and had to regenerate it. I believe it is effectively identical, but have not re-run the experiment.</p>



<p>o3 finds the kerberos authentication vulnerability in the benchmark in 8 of the 100 runs. In another 66 of the runs o3 concludes there is no bug present in the code (false negatives), and the remaining 28 reports are false positives. For comparison, Claude Sonnet 3.7 finds it 3 out of 100 runs and Claude Sonnet 3.5 does not find it in 100 runs.<em> </em>So on this benchmark at least we have a 2x-3x improvement in o3 over Claude Sonnet 3.7.</p>



<p>For the curious, I have uploaded a sample report from o3 (<a href="https://github.com/SeanHeelan/o3_finds_cve-2025-37899/blob/master/o3_finds_CVE-2025-37778.txt">here</a>) and Sonnet 3.7 (<a href="https://github.com/SeanHeelan/o3_finds_cve-XXXX-YYYY/blob/64545eb240239636d88ca477cfd7aa7ae050227f/claude_3_7_finds_CVE-2025-37778.txt">here</a>). One aspect I found interesting is their presentation of results. With o3 you get something that feels like a human-written bug report, condensed to just present the findings, whereas with Sonnet 3.7 you get something like a stream of thought, or a work log. There are pros and cons to both. o3’s output is typically easier to follow due to its structure and focus. On the other hand, sometimes it is too brief, and clarity suffers. </p>



<h2>o3 finds a 0-day (CVE-2025-37899)</h2>



<p>Having confirmed that o3 can find the kerberos authentication vulnerability (CVE-2025-37778) when given the code for the session setup command handler, I wanted to see if it could find it if I give it the code for <strong>all </strong>of the command handlers. This is a harder problem as the command handlers are all found in <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/smb/server/smb2pdu.c">smb2pdu.c</a>, which has ~9k LoC. However, if o3 can still find vulnerabilities when given all of the handlers in one go then it suggests we can build a more straightforward wrapper for o3 that simply hands it entire files, covering a variety of functionality, rather than going handler by handler.</p>



<p>Combining the code for all of the handlers with the connection setup and teardown code, as well as the command handler dispatch routines, ends up at about 12k LoC (~100k input tokens), and as before I ran the experiment 100 times. </p>



<p>o3 finds the kerberos authentication vulnerability in 1 out of 100 runs with this larger number of input tokens, so a clear drop in performance, but it does still find it. More interestingly however, in the output from the other runs I found a report for a similar, but novel, vulnerability that I did not previously know about. This vulnerability is also due to a free of <code>sess-&gt;user</code>, but this time in the session logoff handler.</p>


<div><pre title="">int smb2_session_logoff(struct ksmbd_work *work)
{
	struct ksmbd_conn *conn = work-&gt;conn;
	struct ksmbd_session *sess = work-&gt;sess;
	
    ...
	
    ksmbd_close_session_fds(work);
	ksmbd_conn_wait_idle(conn);
    
    ...
	
    down_write(&amp;conn-&gt;session_lock);
	sess-&gt;state = SMB2_SESSION_EXPIRED;
	up_write(&amp;conn-&gt;session_lock);

	if (sess-&gt;user) {
		ksmbd_free_user(sess-&gt;user);
		sess-&gt;user = NULL;
	}
    ...
</pre></div>


<p>I’ll let o3 explain the issue:</p>



<pre>Short description</pre>



<p>Reading this report I felt my expectations shift on how helpful AI tools are going to be in vulnerability research. If we were to never progress beyond what o3 can do right now, it would still make sense for everyone working in VR to figure out what parts of their work-flow will benefit from it, and to build the tooling to wire it in. Of course, part of that wiring will be figuring out how to deal with the the signal to noise ratio of ~1:50 in this case, but that’s something we are already making progress at. </p>



<p>One other interesting point of note is that when I found the kerberos authentication vulnerability the fix I proposed was as follows:</p>

<p>When I read o3’s bug report above I realised this was insufficient. The logoff handler <em>already</em> sets <code>sess-&gt;user = NULL</code>, but is still vulnerable as the SMB protocol allows two different connections to “bind” to the same session and there is nothing on the kerberos authentication path to prevent another thread making use of <code>sess-&gt;user</code> in the short window after it has been freed and before it has been set to NULL. I had already made use of this property to hit a prior vulnerability in ksmbd but I didn’t think of it when considering the kerberos authentication vulnerability.</p>



<p>Having realised this, I went again through o3’s results from searching for the kerberos authentication vulnerability and noticed that in some of its reports it had made the same error as me, in others it had not, and it had realised that setting <code>sess-&gt;user = NULL</code> was insufficient to fix the issue due to the possibilities offered by session binding. That is quite cool as it means that had I used o3 to find and fix the original vulnerability I would have, in theory, done a better job than without it. I say ‘in theory’ because right now the false positive to true positive ratio is probably too high to definitely say I would have gone through each report from o3 with the diligence required to spot its solution. Still, that ratio is only going to get better. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>LLMs exist at a point in the capability space of program analysis techniques that is far closer to humans than anything else we have seen. Considering the attributes of creativity, flexibility, and generality, LLMs are far more similar to a human code auditor than they are to symbolic execution, abstract interpretation or fuzzing. Since GPT-4 there has been hints of the potential for LLMs in vulnerability research, but the results on real problems have never quite lived up to the hope or the hype. That has changed with o3, and we have a model that can do well enough at code reasoning, Q&amp;A, programming and problem solving that it can genuinely enhance human performance at vulnerability research. </p>



<p>o3 is not infallible. Far from it. There’s still a substantial chance it will generate nonsensical results and frustrate you. What is different, is that for the first time the chance of getting correct results is sufficiently high that it is worth your time and and your effort to try to use it on real problems.  </p>
