<h3>This 9-line summary of textbook physics agrees with 400 years of
experiments.</h3>

<p>9 lines state that general relativity and  the 
standard model of particle physics describe all of nature.  The free physics
volume telling more about each line is linked.<!--<p>Motion has no surprises. Nature follows rules.-->

<p> Find one and
	become famous!


</p><p> The nine lines determine all equations of
physics:
 
</p><p>  Lines 1, 2 and 3, together,
uniquely determine special and general relativity, cosmology, the Hilbert
Lagrangian and Einstein&#39;s field equations, <a href="https://www.motionmountain.net/maximumforce.html">as told here.</a>

</p><p>  Lines 1, 2 and 4 to 9,
together, uniquely determine quantum field theory and the Lagrangian of 
the standard model of particle physics, with massive neutrinos.


</p><p> The nine lines resulted from the work of millions
of scientists and engineers.

</p><p> Galileo started around the 
year 1600; line 1 resulted after over 150 years. 
Line 5 arose from 1824 to 1929, line 6 arose</p><p> The nine lines contain physics, chemistry, material 
science, biology, medicine, geology, astronomy, engineering and computer
science. 

</p><p> It appears 
	that the nine lines contain all natural sciences!


</p><p> The nine 
lines contain all present knowledge about nature, including
all textbook physics and all observations ever made.

</p><p> Isn&#39;t this incredible?

the 9 lines – or are there phenomena <i>beyond</i> present textbook physics?
