Most Technical Problems Are Really People Problems

tragedy is that they are incredibly productive ICs, but may fail
 with bigger initiatives because they are only one person - a single 
processor core can only go so fast.  Perhaps equally valuable is the &#34;heads <i>up</i> coder&#34; - the person who is deeply technical, but also able to pick their head up &amp; see project risks coming (technical &amp; otherwise) and steer the team around them.</p>
