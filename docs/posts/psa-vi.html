    <h1>PSA VI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I’m pleased to announce that I introduced HTTPS to my blog today! From now on you can read my blog posts through the comfort of a secure connection, powered by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>. I didn’t deploy it any sooner because <a href="http://n-gate.com/software/2017/07/12/0/">I really don’t have to use HTTPS</a>, seeing as my blog doesn’t have any interactive content. It’s all just static diatribes of yours truly, no strings attached.</p>
<p>But of course I have some security-minded folks in my inner friend circle who’ve been wanting to read my blog through HTTPS, and as it really isn’t that much work to set it up I decided to give the people what they want. Thanks to Let’s Encrypt, it’s also free for me.</p>
<p>Anyway, I won’t force you to use HTTPS in the future and the HTTP version will still remain online, so there is something for everyone.</p>
<p>I also have two blog posts about Carp in the pipeline, so stay tuned!</p>
