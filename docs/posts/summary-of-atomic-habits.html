    <h1>Summary of Atomic Habits</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><time datetime="2021-09-18">September 18, 2021</time></p><p>The most important ideas in your typical 300-page book can usually be distilled into several pages. These several pages are the <em>thinner book</em>. The smaller the difference in size between the actual book and the thinner book, the better the book. For example, almost every paragraph in Lessons of history by Will and Ariel Durant contains some profound piece of information. This is no surprise, as the book itself is an aggregation of frequently occurring patterns and ideas the authors identified while writing an eleven-volume series on the history of civilization. It goes without saying, lessons of history is a <em>great</em> book. This post is the first of many where I&#39;ll attempt to liberate the thinner books that live within some of my own favorite books.</p></article></div>
