<p>In 1900, in his book &#34; The 300-Meter Tower &#34;, Gustave Eiffel wrote, &#34;<strong><em>We will most likely never realize the full importance of painting the Tower, that it is the essential element in the conservation of metal works and the more meticulous the paint job, the longer the Tower shall endure</em></strong>.&#34;</p>
<p>The Tower has been re-painted 19 times since its initial construction, an average of once every seven years. It has changed colour several times, passing from red-brown to yellow-ochre, then to chestnut brown and finally to the bronze of today, slightly shaded off towards the top to ensure that the colour is perceived to be the same all the way up as it stands against the Paris sky.</p>

                                    <p>The Eiffel Tower is built using puddle iron, a material with a practically eternal lifespan if it is just regularly repainted! Indeed, there are various factors that can threaten this metal such as rust, the unavoidable pollution in a city, and bird droppings.</p>

<ul><li><strong>1887/88</strong> : &#34;Venetian red&#34; paint, applied in the workshop before the parts were assembled.</li>
<li><strong>1889 </strong>: Application of a very thick, reddish-brown coat.</li>
<li><strong>1892</strong> : The Tower turns &#34;ochre brown&#34;.</li>
<li><strong>1899</strong> : A coat of 5 colours is painted in shaded tones from yellow-orange at the base to light yellow at the top. It was after this repainting campaign that the 7-year cycle was adopted for the renewal of the paintwork.</li>
<li><strong>1907-1917-1924-1932-1939-1947</strong> : The colour is called &#34;yellow-brown&#34;. The 1917 repainting was delayed because of the war.</li>
<li><strong>1954-61</strong> : A new colour for the Eiffel Tower: &#34;brownish-red&#34;.</li>
<li><strong>Since 1968</strong> : The colour “Eiffel Tower Brown” is chosen for its harmony with the Parisian cityscape. It was applied in three shaded tones, with the darkest at the bottom and the lightest at the top.</li>

                <h2>A Guide to the Repainting Campaigns:</h2>
<h3><strong>First things first: security equipment</strong></h3>
<p>Before the painters begin, specialists in work on tall buildings first fit safety nets and safety lines.</p>
<h3><strong>Safety Lines </strong></h3>
<p>Painters are equipped with harnesses to work on the Eiffel Tower&#39;s beams. Their security is ensured under the best possible conditions thanks to the systematic installation of safety lines (lignes de vie), which allow the workers to move around freely while staying attached to the structure at all times.</p>
<h3><strong>Safety nets</strong></h3>
<p>Safety nets are fitted to secure the work areas (against falling objects) and to catch any paint flakes. In 2009 they were equipped with an “anti-drip” system for the first time, using polymer film.</p>
<h3><strong>Tool safety</strong></h3>
<p>All of the tools used are attached to the painters’ belts or wrists, including paint pots and brushes.</p>
<ul></ul>

                <h2><strong>The Painter’s Work: to form an assessment, to clean, to apply the paint</strong></h2>
<p>The extent and complexity of the work requires a rigorous methodology that includes a preparatory stage to search for the most corroded areas. These areas are then stripped, and a first coat of an anti-rust primer is applied, followed by a second application to strengthen the rust-proofing. Lastly, a final coat of paint is applied.</p>
<h3><strong>The course of Campaigns</strong></h3>
<p>Campaigns can lasts between 18 months and over 3 years, interruptions due to the weather considered:</p>
<ul><li>painting is impossible if the structure is too cold,</li>
<li>the paint does not stick well if the structure is wet.</li>
</ul><ul></ul>
