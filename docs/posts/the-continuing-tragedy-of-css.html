    <h1>The continuing tragedy of CSS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I promised myself I wouldnâ€™t attend any web conferences this year, yet here I am writing about <a href="https://cssday.nl/2023"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Day</a> just two weeks before <a href="https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2023/130/a1/ux_london/">I speak at UX London</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe Iâ€™m weak-willed, but when offered an opportunity, I try to say yes. Hopefully, I wonâ€™t regret saying yes to speaking at UX London. I certainly havenâ€™t regretted saying yes to <a href="https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2015/163/s1/css_day/">speaking at <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Day eight years ago</a>, not least because Peter-Paul and Krijn kindly offer me a badge for each subsequent edition.</p>
<p>The last time I took them up on this offer was in 2019. A lot has happened since.</p>
<p>In previous editions, talks focused on proposed features of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> or ways to work around features that remained painfully absent. This year it felt like the complete opposite was true. Indeed, a common complaint heard in discussions during breaks was that there is now too much <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
<h2 id="increased-surface-area">Increased surface area</h2>
<p>To take one example, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1/">the original <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> specification</a> included 3 relative units for defining a length:</p>
<ul>
<li>pixels (<code>px</code>) relative to the resolution of the canvas</li>
<li>x-height (<code>ex</code>) relative to the height of the letter â€˜xâ€™</li>
<li>ems (<code>em</code>) relative to the font size of the parent container</li>
</ul>
<p>Including rarely used absolute units (<code>in</code>, <code>cm</code>, <code>mm</code>, <code>pt</code> and <code>pc</code>) and percentages, there was just under a handful of length units to remember.</p>
<p>Today there are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units#lengths">18 relative units for length</a> (with pixel now considered an absolute measure), a six-fold increase. Itâ€™s a similar â€“ albeit far more complicated â€“ story for defining colour.</p>
<p>These raw numbers tell an underlying story; websites now appear in a number of different shapes, sizes and <a href="https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2023/157/a1/vision_pro/">dimensions</a>, and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> needs to account for that.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not only the fundamentals of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> that have evolved. With new or expanded modules for layout, typography, animation, audio (<a href="https://tink.uk/why-we-need-css-speech/">though sadly not speech</a>) and more, itâ€™s possible to specialise in a subset of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. Yet when aspects of frontend development not involving JavaScript are seen as ignorable by employers, few will get this opportunity.</p>
<h2 id="google%E2%80%99s-embrace">Googleâ€™s embrace</h2>
<p>The growing surface area of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is countered by developers no longer needing to understand pre-processors or other tools. Sass served the community well, but as <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> slowly morphs into a (more evident) programming language, its days seem numbered. Having the browser do more of the heavy lifting has its benefits.</p>
<p>Yet itâ€™s hard to shake the feeling (real or imagined) that <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and other open standards are defined by an ever-narrowing group of implementors.</p>
<p>This year the conference was sponsored solely by Google (with 3 of the people on stage in its employ). This is a reflection, not only of the current economic climate, but the sheer dominance they hold within the world of web standards.</p>
<p>For all the whooping and hollering, I simply donâ€™t trust Google. With Chrome came the embrace, with Blink the extensions (or â€˜experimentsâ€™). The company tried very hard to complete the journey by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23711172/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages-search-publishers-lawsuit">extinguishing the open web with <abbr title="Accelerated Mobile Pages">AMP</abbr></a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://una.im">Una</a> opened the conference with a fast-paced overview of the state of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. Multiple slides showed support across the four major browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Safari, yet this hid the fact that there are now only three rendering engines: Blink, Gecko and Webkit. Itâ€™s easy to celebrate adoption and compatibility with one less implementation to worry about.</p>
<p>Googleâ€™s developer advocates talk a good game about browser diversity, and point to contributions from Apple and Mozilla, yet these only serve as exceptions to the rule.</p>
<p>And yet. While Google dominates, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> couldnâ€™t be in ruder health. Even <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is getting in on the act, with <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/whats-new-css-ui-2023/#selectmenu"><code>&lt;selectmenu&gt;</code></a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog"><code>&lt;dialog&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/popover"><code>popover</code></a> making common UI patterns easier to implement, the web hopefully a little more accessible as a result.</p>
<p>Like it or not, the web has always flourished under the direction of benevolent dictators, be that Tim Berners-Lee, Ian Hickson, or now the Chrome development team.</p>
<p>So too has it been a clash of western cultures. European post-war idealism created a framework for open collaboration among its scientists, who not only discovered the â€˜<a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/higgs-boson">God Particle</a>â€™, but birthed an <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">openly licensed technology for sharing information</a>. American capitalist ideology and market-led innovation popularised and developed it to the point that the web has become an essential part of everyday life.</p>
<p>The continual push-pull between these competing ideas means the web keeps powering forward, forever <a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/08/ff-webrip/">pronounced dead</a>, yet never more alive.</p>
<h2 id="food-for-thought">Food for thought</h2>
<p>In closing her talk, Una shared this Oscar Wilde quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are only two tragedies in life: one is not getting what one wants, and the other is getting it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel seen. Iâ€™ve long <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/the-web-aesthetic/">advocated embracing the constraints of the platform</a>; does <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> <em>really</em> need <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/sin">trigonometric functions</a>? Yet one personâ€™s creative constraints is anotherâ€™s reason for ignoring <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> entirely. Perhaps thatâ€™s why JavaScript flourished while <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> was consigned to being a â€˜toy languageâ€™.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Day was once again a thought-provoking (sometimes head-exploding) event, with equally thoughtful organisation. And yes, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitterballen">Bitterballen</a> didnâ€™t disappoint. But one <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> conference isnâ€™t enough. This language is now so broad and deep, its implementation across browsers never more stable and complete, that opportunities to grow the community abound.</p>
<p>This community also needs to flourish to keep Silicon Valleyâ€™s giants in check; to prevent them from addressing their own theoretical needs and to keep them focused on helping developers serve user needs. For a web dictated by Google would be a real tragedy, whichever way you look at it.</p>
