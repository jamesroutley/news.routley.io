    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rating: üëé</p><p>Heavily opinionated claims and spoilers ahead.</p><p>I did not enjoy and do not recommend The Diamond Age, by Neil Stephenson. It was a particularly disappointing read for
me because of how much I enjoyed <a href="https://theleo.zone/books/snow-crash">Snow Crash</a> last month.</p><p>The Diamond Age should be called The Rough (Unpolished) Diamond, as this could have been a great book. Imagining what a
post-scarcity world full of accessible nanotechnology and universal 3D ‚Äúmatter printers‚Äù looks like is cool!</p><p>But the story just whipped around between these vignettes. I never really knew who to care about, and if a character
had been around long enough that it seemed like I probably should care about them, I just‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt? I was never
particularly excited to return to the book, and it took me a long time to read because of my general apathy towards
the story.</p><p>Skull guns - cool. Blood-based electro-mites creating mega-consciousness collectively designing the next generation
of matter creation - sweet. Storybooks teaching a teen about Turing machines through interactive castle-based
puzzles - wicked.</p><p>Teenage rape (again) and not-so-subtle mentioning of how hot/perfect young girls are - Jesus, dude. Underground orgies
culminating in spontaneous combustion - somehow boring? Another main character wielding a sword - less cool the second
time around. Unrelated characters interacting in ways that are meant to be but don‚Äôt feel meaningful, grim settings I
can‚Äôt (or don‚Äôt care to) imagine fully, and a general lack of a thread - painful.</p></div></div>
