    <h1>Sony completes $3.6B deal to buy Bungie</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The developer behind <em>Destiny</em> is now a part of the Sony universe. Sony Interactive Entertainment officially closed on a $3.6 billion deal today to buy the independent game studio and publisher Bungie, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1547990161517973519?s=20&amp;t=ATM90hXhWsf4447PwTWTFw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><ins>tweets</ins></a> from both Bungie and PlayStation Studios. Under the terms of the acquisition, Bungie will still maintain creative control over its operations and independently develop its games. As <a href="https://www.sie.com/en/blog/bungie-joining-playstation-the-playstation-studios-perspective/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><ins>leaders</ins></a> from <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50988" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><ins>both</ins></a> <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonys-ceo-says-bungie-acquisition-marks-a-major-step-forward-in-becoming-more-multiplatform/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><ins>companies</ins></a> have noted since the deal was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buy-bungie-destiny-studio-180905449.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">announced</a> in January,  Bungie will be considered an independent subsidiary of Sony and won’t be required to make either current or future games exclusive to PlayStation consoles.</p>

<p>As<em> TechCrunch </em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/26/sony-live-service-bungie-destiny/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><ins>noted</ins></a>, Sony is hoping Bungie’s expertise with games like <em>Destiny </em>will help it expand its own live service game offerings. The company plans to spend 55 percent of PlayStation’s budget on live service games by 2025, revealed Sony CEO Jim Ryan at a May investor presentation. PlayStation plans on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><ins>releasing</ins></a> 10 live service games before March 2026, and Sony believes Bungie’s assistance will be crucial in this effort.</p>
<p>Sony this week also closed on a deal to acquire Montreal-based Haven Studios, which is working on a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/03/21/welcoming-haven-studios-to-the-playstation-studios-family/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><ins>multiplayer title</ins></a> for PlayStation. And Sony is far from finished. The company plans to acquire even more studios over the next few years in a bid to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-26/sony-plans-to-buy-more-game-studios-grow-with-live-services-pc" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><ins>grow</ins></a> its live service and PC offerings, as Ryan has noted in several <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/jim-ryan-sony-buying-studios/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><ins>interviews</ins></a>. And on the Xbox side, Microsoft’s $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard is expected to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0"><ins>close</ins></a> next summer.</p></div><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
