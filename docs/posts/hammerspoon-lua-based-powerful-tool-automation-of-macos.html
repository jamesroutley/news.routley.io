<h2 id="what-is-hammerspoon">What is Hammerspoon?</h2>

<p>This is a tool for powerful automation of OS X. At its core, Hammerspoon is just a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine.
What gives Hammerspoon its power is a set of extensions that expose specific pieces of system functionality, to the user.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-it-do-for-me">What can it do for me?</h2>

<p>You can write Lua code that interacts with OS X APIs for applications, windows, mouse pointers, filesystem objects, audio devices, batteries, screens, low-level keyboard/mouse events, clipboards, location services, wifi, and more.</p>

<p>If you want to explore the options Hammerspoon offers, check out the <a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/go/">Getting Started Guide</a> and the <a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/">full API documentation</a> as well as the already pre-made plugins called <a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/Spoons/">Spoons</a>.</p>

<p>Typically you would write a configuration file in Lua that connects events to actions. You might want to bind a keyboard shortcut to a series of window operations, or an applescript. You might want to run a series of commands when your wifi interface connects to your home network. You might want to display an alert when your battery drops below a certain percentage. You might want to do something crazy like have iTunes automatically start playing when your Mac detects you are in Paris.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-install-it">How do I install it?</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon/releases/latest">Download the latest release</a> and then drag the application to <code>/Applications/</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h2>

<p>Out of the box, Hammerspoon does nothing. You will need to create a Lua script in  <code>~/.hammerspoon/init.lua</code> using our APIs and standard Lua APIs.</p>

<p>If you are new to Hammerspoon, read the <a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/go/">Getting Started Guide</a> with reference to the <a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/docs/">full API documentation</a>.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the Lua scripting language at <a href="https://www.lua.org/docs.html">lua.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-contribute">How can I contribute?</h2>

<p>More extensions will always be a huge benefit to Hammerspoon. They can either be pure Lua scripts that offer useful helper functions, or you can write Objective-C extensions to expose new areas of system functionality to users.
