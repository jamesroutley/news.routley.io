    <h1>40 years on, Former Nintendo employees reveal what it took to launch the NES</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>A panel at the recent Portland Retro Gaming Expo has celebrated the 40th anniversary of the U.S. <a href="https://hanafuda.report/articles/tag/nes/">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> launch, discussing the market challenges faced at the time, various design considerations, and the enduring legacy of the 8-bit home console.</p>



<p>This rare panel, hosted by Frank Cifaldi of the <a href="https://gamehistory.org">Video Game History Foundation</a>, is well worth a watch — bringing together three former Nintendo of America employees to discuss the pivotal 1985 debut. </p>



<p>The discussion features former VP of Sales Bruce Lowry, former marketing manager Gail Tilden, and former designer Lance Barr. They, along with some other guests, discuss the console’s road to release in this roughly hour and 45 minute chat. </p>



<p>It’s packed with stories and interesting tidbits — they recount a focus group of mothers taking issue with the NES Zapper, the origins of the term ‘Game Pak’, CES trade-show tricks, snakes in the Nintendo warehouses and much more.</p>
