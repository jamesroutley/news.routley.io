<p>When you use the ping command, sometimes you get a “pipe” value at the end of the rtt statistics. So what does this mean? I had to dive into the actual ping source code to find out. Here it is <img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20130302161137im_/http://www.vincentverhagen.nl/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)"/> </p>
<p>The “pipe” number is the maximum number of echo request packets that have been under way at one time, without having been answered by an echo reply packet (but did get answered in the end).</p>
<p>Normally, ping will send a so called echo request, wait for a second an then send the next echo request.</p>
<p>You can test this by pinging a system that has a relatively long round trip time (rtt).</p>

<p><code>[root@mail]# ping -c 4 -i 0.01 218.101.61.162</code></p>
