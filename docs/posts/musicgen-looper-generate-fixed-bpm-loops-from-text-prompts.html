    <h1>MusicGen-Looper: Generate fixed-bpm loops from text prompts</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p><em>Generate fixed-bpm loops from text prompts</em></p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
<p>First a piece of music is generated by running the prompt (appending <code>&#34;, {bpm} bpm&#34;</code>) through <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft" rel="nofollow">MusicGen</a>. Then <a href="https://github.com/mjhydri/BeatNet" rel="nofollow">BeatNet</a> detects beats and downbeats. An even number of bars is extracted from the output audio.</p>
<p>Variations are created by using MusicGen&#39;s continuation feature, passing the last bar of the first variation as input to the continuation model.</p>
<p>All variations are time stretched with <a href="https://github.com/bmcfee/pyrubberband" rel="nofollow">Rubberband</a> to match the requested tempo exactly. If the actual tempo of the first variation is +/-10 bpm from the requested tempo, an error is thrown.</p>
<h2>Failure cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>BeatNet often struggles to pick the right downbeat, which causes loops to start on a different beat than 1.</li>
<li>MusicGen has its own limitations, e.g. it can&#39;t generate vocals</li>
</ul>
