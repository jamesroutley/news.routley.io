    <h1>Reverse Engineering iOS 18 Inactivity Reboot</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3312850032502776883">
<p>iOS 18 introduced a new inactivity reboot security feature. What does it protect from and how does it work? This blog post covers all the details down to a kernel extension and the Secure Enclave Processor.</p><h2>Security Before First Unlock / After First Unlock</h2><p>Did you know that entering your passcode for the first time after your phone starts is something very different then entering it later on to unlock your phone?</p><p>When initially entering your passcode, this unlocks a key store in the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP) that encrypts your data on an iPhone.</p><p>The state before entering your passcode for the first time is also called <b>Before First Unlock</b> (BFU). Due to the encrypted user data, your iPhone behaves slightly differently to later unlocks. You&#39;ll see that Face ID and Touch ID won&#39;t work and that the passcode is required. But there&#39;s more subtle things you might notice: Since Wi-Fi passwords are encrypted, your iPhone won&#39;t connect to Wi-Fi networks. If your SIM is not PIN-protected, your iPhone will still connect to cellular networks. That means, technically, you can still receive phone calls. Yet, if you receive a call, even if that number is in your contacts, the contact name won&#39;t be shown, as the contacts haven&#39;t been decrypted yet. Similarly, when you receive notifications about new messages, you&#39;ll see that you got messages, but you won&#39;t see any message previews. You can easily try this yourself!</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEihQqOut8zLHRxuz_g8ornTF1A-X69IoWpX8lZPnZBisvc1t80zBRGebsCj4x4Vz_6C_i_ImG5AszaaQ-rXnFEJeB1-Dfaj4bSBwajxyKLYoKQNdJ8dZZtaqhexYUc1rZL7w_6yXkMj5APTe30fHOMRlg3da55UCxSZhmTFRLWmBEh_iWVgPSyKuVCEQ_48"><img alt="" data-original-height="3936" data-original-width="7142" height="352" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEihQqOut8zLHRxuz_g8ornTF1A-X69IoWpX8lZPnZBisvc1t80zBRGebsCj4x4Vz_6C_i_ImG5AszaaQ-rXnFEJeB1-Dfaj4bSBwajxyKLYoKQNdJ8dZZtaqhexYUc1rZL7w_6yXkMj5APTe30fHOMRlg3da55UCxSZhmTFRLWmBEh_iWVgPSyKuVCEQ_48=w640-h352" width="640"/></a></p></div></div>
