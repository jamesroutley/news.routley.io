    <h1>The Reddit blackout has left Google barren and full of holes – TechRadar</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Over 8,000 subreddits have gone dark in <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-end-of-reddit-heres-why-most-of-the-site-is-down-and-what-happens-next"><u>protest of Reddit&#39;s upcoming API changes</u></a>, and it’s highlighted just how empty Google becomes without access to those subreddits.</p><p>The sheer number of very specific subreddits (essentially smaller forums dedicated to a certain topic) means there is something for everyone, and if you’ve got a question, someone out there will have the answer. Even if you don’t just tag ‘Reddit’ to the end of your search query, the site usually turns up close to the top of most searches anyway, so even if you don’t actively use the platform, you’re likely to have gotten some useful information from there at some point.</p><h2 id="hard-to-find-answers">Hard to find answers</h2><p>For example, I’m currently playing <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and I’ve been having trouble figuring out a lot of the shrines in the game. There are hundreds of shrines, and instead of crawling through YouTube videos or tearing through a walk-through only to realise I have no idea what’s going on, I would just go onto Reddit.</p><p>With many threads no longer showing up (or appearing private, so you cannot read the content) when you’re using Google, you realise just how much Reddit carried the search engine for a lot of people. While the protest was only set to be for 48 hours, it is unclear if a majority of the protesting subreddits will stick to this time frame or if things will go on for longer.</p><p>Hopefully, the protest will end soon (ideally with Reddit management acknowledging the community’s concerns over its proposed API changes), otherwise, Reddit’s blackout will continue to have repercussions for the wider internet, and not just one website.</p>
