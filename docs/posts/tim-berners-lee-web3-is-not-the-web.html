    <h1>Tim Berners-Lee: Web3 is not the web</h1>

In fact, Web3 is not the web at all.&#34;</p><p>Web3 is a nebulous term in the tech world used to describe a hypothetical future version of the internet that&#39;s more decentralized than it is today and not dominated by a handful of powerful players such as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/">Google</a>.</p><p>It involves a few technologies, including blockchain, cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens.</p><p>While breaking our personal data out of Big Tech&#39;s clutches is an ambition shared by Berners-Lee, he&#39;s not convinced blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, will be the solution.</p><p>&#34;Blockchain protocols may be good for some things but they&#39;re not good for Solid,&#34; a web decentralization project led by Berners-Lee, he said. &#34;They&#39;re too slow too expensive and too public. Personal data stores have to be fast, cheap and private.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Ignore the Web3 stuff, random Web3 that was built on blockchain,&#34; he added. &#34;We&#39;re not using that for Solid.&#34;</p><p>Berners-Lee said people too often conflate Web3 with &#34;Web 3.0,&#34; his own proposal for reshaping the internet. His new startup, Inrupt, aims to give users control of their own data, including how it&#39;s accessed and stored. The company raised $30 million in a funding round in December, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/09/tim-berners-lee-inrupt-fundraise/" target="_blank">TechCrunch reported</a>.</p><p>Berners-Lee says that our personal data is siloed by a handful of Big Tech platforms, like Google and Facebook, that use it to &#34;lock us into their platforms.&#34;</p><p>&#34;The result was a big data race where the winner was the one corporation that controlled the most data and the losers were everybody else,&#34; he said.</p><p>His new startup aims to address this through three ways:</p><ul><li>A global &#34;single sign-on&#34; feature that lets anyone log in from anywhere.</li><li>Login IDs that allow users to share their data with others.</li><li>A &#34;common universal API,&#34; or application programming interface, that lets apps pull data from any source.</li></ul><p>Berners-Lee&#39;s not the only notable tech figure with doubts about Web3. The movement has been a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/21/elon-musk-and-jack-dorsey-are-talking-about-web3-heres-why.html">punching bag</a> for some leaders in Silicon Valley, like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TWTR/">Twitter</a> co-founder <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/jack-dorsey/">Jack Dorsey</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/">Tesla</a> CEO <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>. </p><p>Critics say it&#39;s prone to the same issues that come with cryptocurrencies, like fraud and security flaws.</p></div><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107071289" data-vilynx-id="7000248866" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107071290-GettyImages-1354808056.jpg?v=1654481187&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Crypto enthusiasts want to remake the internet with &#39;Web3.&#39; Here&#39;s what that means"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div>
