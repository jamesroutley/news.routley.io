    <h1>GitHub Renamed Me (2014)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div>
            <p>In preparation for <a href="http://www.russbishop.net/contextlocal-t">a new post</a>, I logged in to GitHub recently. I created my account two years ago in anticipation of being able to open-source more code and I wanted to reserve my name; I had a couple of forked repos but that&#39;s it. A new baby and a wife with major back surgery will do that to you. </p>

<p>Imagine my surprise when I logged in today and found that my account had been renamed. No longer was I known as <code>github.com/rbishop</code>. Instead, I was now relegated to <code>github.com/rbishop-xx</code>. </p>

<p>How <em>curious</em>.</p>

<p>I next noticed a warning about verifying my SSH key. </p>

<p><em>&#34;Why self, I don&#39;t remember uploading an SSH key just yet&#34;</em></p>

<p><em>&#34;Well self, that&#39;s because you <strong>haven&#39;t</strong>&#34;</em></p>

<p>Now I was even more <em>curious</em>. Had my account been hacked? Had I made a mistake somewhere? That&#39;s when I checked Account Settings, Security, Security History and behold two months ago:</p>

<p><img alt="Silvrback blog image" src="https://silvrback.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/e29665d2-2220-4d46-88c3-3b0cd4be4bcd/rathjenc_key_large.png"/></p>

<p>Whoever this <em>rathjenc</em> character was, he had not only renamed my account but <strong>he uploaded an SSH key, thus allowing him to modify my repos at-will.</strong></p>

<p>Just who was this rathjenc fellow?</p>

<p><img alt="Silvrback blog image" src="https://silvrback.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/c103f12c-1287-4fe3-ad03-984b35d258e5/rathjenc_large.png"/></p>

<p>Now I am merely left with questions. </p>

<p><strong>Why is an official Github representative renaming accounts and modifying people&#39;s SSH keys without so much as an email to the account holder?</strong> </p>

<p>There is now a new owner of the <code>rbishop</code> name: Richard B; is he a friend of Chris? Was Chris doing his buddy a favor by kicking me off? </p>

<p>Or perhaps it&#39;s because Richard B is a member of their Developer program. Maybe people who pay more or develop Github integrations have priority on names?</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s just policy that you can take someone else&#39;s name if you ask <em>real nice</em> ?</p>

<p>Whatever the case, I certainly couldn&#39;t find any documentation of this forced-renaming policy on Github&#39;s website, and as we all know they&#39;re a professional organization. <a href="http://recode.net/2014/03/15/prominent-github-engineer-julie-ann-horvath-quits-claiming-gender-based-harassment/">They certainly don&#39;t have founder&#39;s non-employee wives running around intimidating employees.</a> </p>

<p>As I said earlier, how <em>curious</em>.</p>
