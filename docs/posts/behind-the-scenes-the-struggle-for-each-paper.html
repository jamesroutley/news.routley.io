<p>
	The start of my sabbatical has given me a moment to reflect on my publications. But <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/CurriculumVitae.pdf">my CV</a> only shows a list of neatly cataloged papers: title, authors, conference. Each one appearing no different from another. But how each paper ended up published is its own story, a story about people and opportunity.
</p>
<p>
	Using notes from <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/productivity_text_file/">my research journal</a> and conference records, I reassembled the &#34;Behind the scenes&#34; story for each of my full research papers: 15 papers as a student, and 15 papers after becoming a professor (excluding papers not led by my research group, as I feel it&#39;s not my place to tell those stories). This is as much a <a href="#introspection">reflective exercise for myself</a> than it is for an audience.
</p>
<p>
	If you read this page in its entirety, it will take about 30 minutes. But you can skip any story, and it should still make sense. The first half are my <a href="#student_papers">student stories</a>, and the second half are my <a href="#professor_papers">professor stories</a>, so you can even just read the half that&#39;s more interesting to you. This would probably be more enticing as a series of Tweets or a Substack newsletter, but I&#39;d rather post it all at once.
</p>
<p>
	I&#39;d love to read the backstories of other peoples&#39; publications too. So if you feel comfortable sharing, post yours and email me if you want it linked at the bottom of this page so we can start a collection. Anyways, here goes.

<h3>Part 1: Papers as a student author</h3>
<hr/>

<ol><li>
I first stumbled upon research in September 2003 while I was a second-year undergraduate student. My inbox popped up the message, <em>&#34;call me or track me down in class, &#39;cause a full explanation will take a lot of typing. -Bo&#34;</em>.</li><hr/><li>
My next paper was sadly my first and only full paper with my original advisor, <a href="https://efthi.ischool.uw.edu/">Efthi, before he passed</a>. I don&#39;t remember coming up with this idea to study query reformulations, so it must have been he who led me to it. It was intended to be something easy but original—a starter project analyzing the sequences in existing data released by AOL.</li><hr/><li>
I met Ryen from Microsoft Research when he was a visiting speaker in Efthi&#39;s class, and he must have found my internship application that mentioned my paper about query reformulations. Well it turned out he was interested in search trails, which are essentially a series of reformulations, so I was able to continue along that line of work.</li><hr/><li>
This related paper came out of the same summer internship with Ryen. I was lucky to be included in the author list because I had a small role and never even met the first author. Besides my initial work over the summer that was moreso for the paper above this, I contributed only a paragraph of original writing. After reading this paper, I felt like it was better than the one I had contributed more, but it has received fewer than half the citations.
</li><hr/><li>
I met a brilliant intern during that same summer, Anna, who was doing her <em>first of two</em> Math PhDs at that time and often seemed idle. She explained, &#34;the people who are always busy never seem to get much done.&#34; So sensing her free time, I asked her to help solve a made-up hypothetical problem that simplified assumptions from the information retrieval community.</li><hr/><li>
After the summer, I was looking for new ideas to pursue outside my usual information retrieval topics. A friend in the Ph.D. program Gifford came to me with the suggestion that watching people playing video games was an overlooked phenomenon. But no one was paying attention. At that time, you could really only watch low-resolution videos of Korean players with amateur commentary dubbed in English.</li><hr/><li>
This became the most important paper during my Ph.D., and it was minutes from not happening. The idea was one of three that I tossed around during my interview to be a Research Intern at Bing. But to apply this idea to the search engine required a complex series of software integration steps that I was not too familiar with; yet it had to be committed by deadlines that occurred every two weeks.</li><hr/><li>
Back at school, and with momentum from our previous paper about gaming, Gifford and I looked at one of his rejected papers about Texas Hold&#39;em, and expanded it with data from another game, Halo 2. We repeated our formula of qualitative analysis, and submitted to CSCW. It received borderline ratings from our reviewers, but CSCW was experimenting with a &#34;revise and resubmit&#34; process that we were lucky to go through.
</li><hr/><li>
At this point, one of my friends from the summer internship, Abdi, felt like I had &#34;the magic touch&#34; so I offered to help out with a rejected internship paper. I only helped brainstorm and edit, but it did end up getting accepted without much fanfare. While this one worked out, a year later I tried to rescue another paper with him, but it only ended up in the bin. Same effort, opposite outcomes.
</li><hr/><li>
Now it was the end of my third year, and I felt guilty that I only had one dissertation chapter ready. I had co-founded a startup as part of Techstars Seattle while teaching a class in the evening, so those things had occupied all of my time. Our startup eventually ran out of money and my co-founders left for other opportunities, so in the summer I returned to Microsoft Research for my third internship. Again I joined a different group, this one managed by Sue who a year later became my Ph.D. advisor.</li><hr/><li>
A Bing employee, Georg, had collected a nice dataset from a study for one purpose, but it seemed like it could be used to study something closer to what I had done before. He graciously lent me the data, and I did enough analysis to produce this paper. However, one reviewer felt that the descriptive results were not that novel (just a bigger study), nor were the predictive analysis that successful, summarizing &#34;with their paper they now try to add more to this field, but I don&#39;t see the important contribution that would justify the publication at CHI.&#34; The opinions were ultimately divided.</li><hr/><li>
The third paper of that summer was an easier analysis with a novel idea—that sophisticated use of browser tabs was a central part to finding information. I recruited another student from my university, Tom, who happened to be there interning the same summer. The metareviewer remarked quite correctly, &#34;The paper is not rocket science but [...] to my knowledge has not really been looked at, at least not at this large scale.&#34;</li><hr/><li>
As a bonus for the summer, Georg was writing his own paper, and I had a minor contribution that he deemed enough for a co-authorship. It got a decent number of citations and filled a nice gap in the research field, as well as in my dissertation. So it became a lucky 4-paper summer. I was exhausted by the end of it and took a nice long break.
</li><hr/><li>
Besides the two papers with Gifford about gaming, I wasn&#39;t doing any research during the school year, as all my other papers were from internships. Without an advisor, I served as a teaching assistant every quarter (sometimes for two or even three classes at once), and got a bit distracted with some other activities.</li><hr/><li>
I wasn&#39;t originally planning to do another research internship at Microsoft in my last summer, but Tom and Nachi reached out to me about an opportunity I couldn&#39;t say no to—a summer to study gaming with large-scale Xbox data. So in my last summer, I joined their gaming research initiative. It was a collaboration between Microsoft Research and folks from Xbox, and along the way I learned a few techniques for time-series analysis.</li>

<h3>Part 2: Papers as a faculty author</h3>
<hr/><li>
Up to this point, I was feeling comfortable leading a paper from start to finish, but the job changed when I became faculty. While I could come up with the idea and advise the process, the initial drafts would be written by students.</li><hr/><li>
While teaching my graduate seminar, I was overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of the students so I started assigning projects that students could recycle into research. This became the first of a few papers that were born from class projects in my HCI seminars. Each student worked on their own mini-study, and we combined it into a meta analysis, which is a formula that worked for a couple more papers in later years as well.</li><hr/><li>
I led my first Ph.D. student Alexandra in a few unfruitful directions trying to continue ideas from my Ph.D. that ended up with two unpublished papers worth of work (so I&#39;m grateful for her patience). But one day while laying in bed I realized we could flip the story from estimating attention with the cursor, to using the webcam while the cursor auto-calibrates the webcam model during regular web browsing. We could deploy this as a library, basically shipping a product.</li><hr/><li>
I admitted a second student, Nedi, to our Ph.D. program who had prior work on sleep diary research during her undergrad. My brainstorming notes in the months before she arrived was, &#34;we will use data-driven techniques across a large populations sleep data to make (personalized) prescriptive sleep recommendations&#34;. By coincidence, I met some new collaborators who had clinical research expertise for this, so Nedi and her team of research assistants set out with these collaborators to develop the software and the study.</li><hr/><li>
This paper followed from Alexandra&#39;s previous one, so was a bit more straightforward as a follow-on application to our previous work. Reviewers like it, and it received an honorable mention. I wish I had more to say, but it was one of the rare times where the idea was universally agreeable and the results were as expected. Later I learned that during my tenure application, an external letter writer remarked that I didn&#39;t have many follow-up papers (sequels) at that time, in fact just this one.
</li><hr/><li>
Work on this paper started mid-2015, led by Shaun, a Masters student who became a Ph.D. student later. It was a fairly complex product so it took the team substantial time to build it out, and the paper was not published until 2 years later. What&#39;s nice is the paper had some broad impacts: two of the undergraduate students working on it are in Ph.D. programs now, and there are still active users of the online web application 6 years since the work started.</li><hr/><li>
We followed a similar formula as before, having students in the HCI seminar run mini-studies, which became a meta study for this paper. But things were not so easy this time around, as the first version of the paper with one cohort struggled to reveal enough compelling findings. So we had to develop a new procedure for students in the seminar in another year, and combined the results from both cohorts for the submission.</li><hr/><li>
This paper was an exhausting amount of work for Alexandra, collecting a high-quality dataset with the hopes to release it as a contribution. The setup, lengthy procedure, and large number of participants were meant to provide stronger validity for the general topic of eye tracking during interactions.</li><hr/><li>
My most recent Ph.D. admit, Jing, came with a unique design and technical background, so started working on an ambitious virtual reality project. However, that idea had trouble producing consistent results in practice, but I noted in my research journal on October 2016 that the &#34;motion movement physical device that Jing built that can be used for replay too&#34;. So we pivoted to building the product for a different use case which became this paper.</li><hr/><li>
After meeting with Eda, a Masters student who wanted to work on a research project with me, the first note in my research journal was &#34;discussed rewind: cool idea but low chance of publishing&#34;. I had no idea how true that would be, as this became the most challenging paper my group would publish. What started in January 2015 was published December 2018, 4 years later, and was passed from student to student after each one graduated. I lost count of the number of rejections.</li><hr/><li>
This was the first time I had been involved in a project with both hardware and software components, so the system itself took longer than expected, and we were writing this paper down to the deadline. The paper had to be carefully crafted to describe a complex configuration, with 3D-printed parts, augmented reality, cameras and sensors, computer vision, heating and energy issues, and both wired and wireless networking.</li><hr/><li>
Nedi turned her earlier SleepCoacher paper into a fully automated process, completing our vision from the seed of an idea 6 years ago. The product described in this paper was shipped to the app stores and used by whoever would come across and download it, basically real usage by people we did not recruit. We maintained Android and iOS apps separately, and a server to do the calculations. It was a costly mistake to build out three separate systems; we should have started with something cross-platform and performed the calculations in the app itself to reduce the software maintenance from three systems to one.</li><hr/><li>
This idea grew out of my NSF CAREER Award as the required educational component, where I proposed a classroom tool for large-class simultaneous design activities. But the code was written and rewritten several times by different teams even after that, because running a real-time collaborative system with over 100 simultaneous users introduced its own share of problems.</li><hr/><li>
In 2014, I met with a faculty member in Psychiatry and Human Behavior to discuss a collaboration, where we concluded that the area of mental health lacked innovative computational techniques. I did a rough prototype of our initial idea in 2015, then students picked it up the following year. The work was passed between teams of students, mainly supporting the application development and real usage from a growing list of collaborators. It turns out that many clinical researchers felt the same, and this became our most funded project.</li><hr/><li>
We had been wanting to expand Nedi&#39;s SleepBandits app beyond sleep to all sorts of self-experimentation, and finally got a chance when NSF extended one of my expiring grants to fund this paper.</li></ol><hr/>
<h3 id="introspection">Introspection</h3>
<hr/>
<p>After reviewing these notes, I&#39;m a bit ambivalent. When I was a clueless student, I got lucky with my collaborators and acceptance decisions, which made all the difference. After becoming a professor, I had the experience yet the papers take even longer to publish.</p>
<p>Part of <em>why</em> is the focus on systems papers, which are <a href="http://dubfuture.blogspot.com/2009/11/i-give-up-on-chiuist.html">known to take 3-4 years</a>, but shipping them as products has been an even longer 4+ year agenda. Worth it, sure, but we&#39;ll never be like most groups that publish 5+ papers a year.</p>
<p>But I also think about how my group has encountered a lot of rejection, and keeping up morale was sometimes difficult. Bad news injects doubt and discouragement into students&#39; minds, who then have to rally the team to continue the work in hope that acceptance is just around the corner. This dissonance is hard to manage.</p>
<p>The other thing I noticed is that papers that get the most citations later often got poor reviews or multiple rejections. They&#39;re usually about a new phenomenon, but the novelty can always be recast as &#34;old thing, but just on the web&#34; or &#34;mostly engineering work, with so-so results&#34;. With this in mind, I should probably be generous in my own interpretation of what&#39;s novel when I review papers.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I am grateful for many key collaborators for their extra help in those times, and that some conferences like UIST accepted papers despite some obvious flaw because those papers ended up defining long-term research programs for multiple young researchers.</p>
