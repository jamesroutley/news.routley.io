    <h1>Piece of paper quiets Intel Alder Lake stock coolers</h1>

        In 2022, Intel redesigned their stock CPU coolers to make them beefier, more performant, but primarily better looking. Still, it was a necessary upgrade, as their previous line was not adequate at cooling 12th gen CPUs.

        Looking at the images, I noticed a difference between their i5 cooler (on the left) and their i9 cooler (right): the i9 cooler had a blue plastic cowl around the fan, while the i5 had some weird open-air plastic fin design.
        </p>
        <h2>What happens if I add a cowl to the i5 cooler?</h2>
        <p>
        I created a cowl out of a piece of paper, taping the ends together to form a cylinder. It took finesse, but I managed to get the paper fitting snugly inside the cooler without the fan hitting it. No glue needed!

        In fact, I did more than just that. I actually tested a few cowls of different heights, from under an inch, to over three inches in height. Below are the results of testing using <a href="https://openbenchmarking.org/test/pts/blender-1.9.1">Blender as my benchmark</a>.

            <tr>
                <td>No cowl</td>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I was amazed at how quiet short cowls made the cooler. To give you an idea of how each sound, here is the stock noise, sounding like a dental drill:</p>
