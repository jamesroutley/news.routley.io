  <h2><a name="AboutFrink">About Frink</a></h2>
  <p>
   Frink is a practical calculating tool and programming language designed to
   make physical calculations simple, to help ensure that answers come out
   right, and to make a tool that&#39;s really useful in the real world.  It
   tracks units of measure (feet, meters, kilograms, watts, etc.) through all
   calculations, allowing you to mix units of measure transparently, and helps
   you easily verify that your answers make sense.  It also contains a large
   <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkdata/units.txt">data file</a> of physical quantities,
   freeing you from having to look them up, and freeing you to make
   effortless calculations without getting bogged down in the mechanics.
  </p>

  <p>
   Perhaps you&#39;ll get the best idea of what Frink can do if you skip down to
   the <a href="#SampleCalculations">Sample Calculations</a> further on this
   document.  Come back up to the top when you&#39;re done.
  </p>

  <p>
   Frink was named after one of my personal heroes, and great scientists of
   our time, the brilliant Professor John Frink.  Professor Frink noted,
   decades ago:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    <i>&#34;I predict that within 100 years, computers will be twice as powerful,
     ten <b>thousand</b> times larger, and so expensive that only the five
     richest kings of Europe will own them.&#34;</i>
   </p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2><a name="Features">Features</a></h2>
  <p>
   For those with a short attention span like me, here are some of the
   features of Frink.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><a href="#HowFrinkIsDifferent">Tracks units of measure</a> (feet,
    meters, tons, dollars, watts, etc.) through all calculations and allows
    you to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them effortlessly, and makes
    sure the answer comes out correct, even if you mix units like gallons and
    liters.

   </li><li><a href="#NumericTypes">Arbitrary-precision math</a>, including huge
    integers and floating-point numbers, rational numbers (that is, fractions
    like 1/3 are kept without loss of precision,) complex numbers, and
    intervals.

   </li><li><a href="#CommonFunctions">Advanced mathematical functions</a>
    including trigonometric functions (even for complex numbers,) <a href="#NumberTheory">factoring and primality testing</a>, and <a href="#AllYourBaseConversions">base conversions</a>.

   </li><li><a href="#Conversions">Unit Conversion</a> between thousands of unit
     types with a <em>huge</em> built-in <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkdata/units.txt">data
      file</a>.

   </li><li><a href="#DateTimeHandling">Date/time math</a> (add offsets to dates,
    find out intervals between times,) timezone conversions, and
    user-modifiable date formats.

   </li><li><a href="#TextTranslation">Translates</a> between several human
    languages, including English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch,
    Korean, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, Swedish, and Arabic.

   </li><li>Calculates historical buying power of the <a href="#HistoricalUSPriceData">U.S. dollar</a> and <a href="#HistoricalBritishPriceData">British pound</a>.

   </li><li>Calculates <a href="#InternationalExchangeRates">exchange rates</a>
    between most of the world&#39;s currencies.

   </li><li>Powerful <a href="#RegularExpressions">regular expression</a>
    capabilities and text processing.

   </li><li>Supports <a href="#UnicodeInFrink">Unicode</a> throughout, allowing
    processing of almost all of the world&#39;s languages.

   </li><li>Supports <a href="#IntervalArithmetic">Interval Arithmetic</a> (also
    known as <em>Interval Computations</em>) in calculations, allowing you to
    automagically calculate error bounds and uncertainties in all of your
    calculations.

   </li><li>Reads <a href="#InputAndOutput">HTTP and FTP-based URLs</a> as easily
    as reading local files, allowing fetching of live web-based data.

   </li><li>Runs on most major operating systems (anything with Java 1.1 or later,)
    as an <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/FrinkApplet.html">applet</a>, through a <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/frink.fsp">web-based interface</a>, on <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/android.html">Android</a>, and on <a href="#SmallDevices">many
     mobile  phones and hand-held devices</a>.

   </li><li>Installs itself on your system in seconds using <a href="#JavaWebStart">Java Web Start</a> and automatically keeps itself
    updated when new versions of Frink are released.

     Interface</a> (Swing, AWT, and <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/android.html">Android</a>) or a
     command-line interface. 

   </li><li>User interface has a <a href="#ProgrammingMode">Programming Mode</a>
    which allows you to write, edit, save, and run extremely powerful programs
    even on a handheld device.

   </li><li>Frink has a simple but powerful system for drawing <a href="#Graphics">graphics</a> which are resizable, support transparency
    and anti-aliasing, and can be printed or written to image files.  Graphics
    can also have exact lengths, so that a 3-centimeter line is three
    centimeters long when printed.

   </li><li>Powers <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/fspdocs.html">Frink Server Pages</a>, a system for
    providing dynamic web pages powered by Frink.

  <h2>Using Frink</h2>
  <h3><a name="TryAsYouRead">Try as you read</a></h3>
  <p>
   If you want to try the calculations as you&#39;re reading,
   <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/frink.fsp" target="_blank">click here to open the web-based
    interface in a new window.</a>  The web-based interface gives hints for
   new users, which may make it the easiest way to learn how to use Frink.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   If you have a frames-enabled browser, and you don&#39;t see a Frink sidebar to
   the left, you can also <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/frinkframe.html">click here to try Frink in
    a sidebar</a> as you read this.  (The sidebar mode doesn&#39;t give as many
   hints, though.)
  </p>

  <h3><a name="JavaWebStart">Download using Java Web Start</a></h3>
  <p>
   <b>Quick Start:</b> On many platforms, if you already have Java installed,
   you can start Frink in the GUI mode by simply downloading and
   double-clicking the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frink.jar"><code>frink.jar</code></a> file.  For more
   startup options, see the <a href="#DownloadingFrink">Downloading Frink</a>
   section.
  </p>

  <p>
   Another method of installation requires Java Web Start, which is installed
   with most versions of Java.  Using Java Web Start <del>is</del> used to
   be a great way to run Frink if you don&#39;t need to run programs from the
   command-line.  (But you <em>can</em> still write and run programs from the
   GUI using Java Web Start!)  If you do want to run programs from the
   command-line, see the <a href="#DownloadingFrink">Downloading Frink</a>
   section below.  Java Web Start will allow you to automatically get the
   latest version of Frink and will update Frink automatically when new
   versions are available.
  </p>

  <h4>Installation Steps</h4>
  <ol>
   <li>If you <em>don&#39;t</em> have a recent version of Java, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://java.com/">get it from Sun.</a>
    (Link opens in new window.)
     
   </li><li>(<i>Optional</i>) If you&#39;ve never installed anything with Java Web
   Start, please read and understand the <a target="_blank" href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/faq.html#AboutSecurityWarnings">FAQ entry about the security warnings
   you&#39;ll see</a> (link opens in new window) and your alternate download
    options.

   </li><li><b>Warning:</b>  Most major browsers have now disallowed Java plugins to
    run in the browser.  However, if you have a Java Virtual Machine
    installed, you probably still have Java Web Start installed, which you
    need to invoke from the command-line with the command
    <code>javaws</code>.  In Fedora, you can make sure this is installed by
    installing the <code>icedtea-web</code> package from your package manager,
    <i>e.g.</i> as root, typing <code>dnf install icedtea-web</code> and then
    one of the commands below.  In Debian-like environments, you may install
    this by installing the <code>icedtea-netx</code> package, <i>e.g.</i> as
    root, typing <code>apt-get install icedtea-netx</code> and then one of the
    commands below.

   </li><li><b>Warning:</b> If you&#39;re using Java version 7u51 or later, they
    silently and incompatibly decided to change default security settings so
    you&#39;ll need to open the Java Control Panel to allow Frink to run.
    Otherwise you will see a dialog that says something like &#34;Application
    blocked by security settings&#34; or &#34;Your security settings have blocked a
    self-signed application from running.&#34;  (This silent change was made after
    12+ years of the aforementioned method working fine.)
    <p>
     The best way to allow Frink to run is to follow the instructions <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/upcoming_exception_site_list_in" target="_blank">listed here</a> and add <code>http://futureboy.us</code>
     to the exceptions list in step 7.
     
     </p><p><b>Note:</b> As always, Java&#39;s instructions and installer are
     terrible, and the Java Control panel on Windows may actually be under
     your Start menu as <code>Java</code> | <code>Configure Java</code>, or
     under your Windows Control Panel, or if you start your Control Panel and
     don&#39;t see it, Java&#39;s control panel will be hidden under &#34;32-bit Control
     Panel.&#34;  And sometimes you&#39;ll have multiple versions of Java installed
     and the one that gets started isn&#39;t the latest version. I had
     <em>lots</em> of problems until I manually uninstalled <em>all</em> the
     versions of Java on the Windows machine, reinstalled the latest version,
     and uninstalled Frink and reinstalled it.  Sorry about that.  Windows and
     Java integration is terrible.  (The <code>icedtea-web</code> package for
     Fedora and other installations contains a vastly better implementation of
     Java Web Start.)

   </p></li><li>Click one of the options below to install Frink: (see the screenshots below):
    <ul>
     <li><a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frink.jnlp">Swing Interface</a>
      Prettier.  Requires Java 1.5.0 or later.
      <p>
       <b>Note:</b> If your browser no longer supports Java in the browser,
       you can probably install this from the command-line by typing:
      </p>

      <p>
       <code>javaws https://futureboy.us/frinkjar/frink.jnlp</code>
      </p>
      
     </li><li><a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frinkwithlibs.jnlp">Swing Interface with standard
       libraries</a>.  This is a version of Frink that contains a variety of <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/frinklibs.fsp">standard libraries</a> and useful programs.
      It&#39;s a larger download, but the standard libraries change somewhat
      infrequently and should only get downloaded when changes are made.

      <p>
       <b>Note:</b> If your browser no longer supports Java in the browser,
       you can probably install this from the command-line by typing:
      </p>

      <p>
       <code>javaws https://futureboy.us/frinkjar/frinkwithlibs.jnlp</code>
      </p>

      
     </li><li><a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frinkawt.jnlp">AWT Interface</a> -
      Not as pretty as the Swing mode, but will run on older JVMs.
      <p>
       <b>Note:</b> If your browser no longer supports Java in the browser,
       you can probably install this from the command-line by typing:
      </p>

      <p>
       <code>javaws https://futureboy.us/frinkjar/frinkawt.jnlp</code>
      </p>
    </li></ul>
  </li></ol>

  <p>
   If you&#39;ve read those <a target="_blank" href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/faq.html#AboutSecurityWarnings">security notes</a>, and understood
   what the security messages are telling you, and the warnings are still too
   scary, (and you don&#39;t want to send me the $400 per year it would cost me to
   remove at least one of them,) and you&#39;d rather download a limited version
   of Frink that runs in the most restrictive security sandbox (breaking some
   features), then <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frinklimited.jnlp">click here to install
   a limited version of Frink.</a> Again, please read those <a target="_blank" href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/faq.html#AboutSecurityWarnings">security notes</a> to see what
   features will be unavailable if you choose this option.  You can always get
   the full version of Frink later if you need those features.
  </p>

  <p>
   If someone wants to send me the $400 necessary to get a VeriSign &#34;Code
   Signing Cerificate&#34;, I&#39;ll sign it just for you.  It won&#39;t work any
   differently.)
  </p>

  <p>
   If you have an old version of Java Web Start, Frink will probably show up
   in the &#34;Downloaded Applications&#34; section of the Java Web Start panel which
   isn&#39;t immediately visible.  Use the <code>View</code> menu option to select
   the Downloaded Applications tab.  It will also let you create a Frink
   shortcut on your desktop or in your start menu.  The defaults in Java Web
   Start before version 1.4.2 are set oddly so that the <em>second</em> time
   you run Frink, it will ask you if you want to make a shortcut.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you&#39;re using Linux, and Sun&#39;s Java release, only Java version 1.5 beta
   and later will install shortcuts onto your desktop and start menu.  Highly
   recommended.
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="UserInterfaceOptions">User Interface Options</a></h2>
  
  <h3><a name="SwingUserInterface">Swing User Interface</a></h3>
  
  <p>
   The Swing version allows mixed fonts and colors.  Due to some performance
   bugs in Sun&#39;s Swing implementation (like large paragraphs taking several
   minutes to paint every time you resize or scroll,) it can be problematic.
   As of 2008-08-25, the capabilities of the Swing and AWT interfaces are
   about the same.

   The AWT user interface has several modes.  The two-line conversion mode and

   devices usually can&#39;t run Swing, but all Java platforms should be able to
   run AWT.

  <h3><a name="FrinkAsAnApplet">Frink As An Applet</a></h3>
  <p>
   If your web browser supports Java 1.3.1 or later, try the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/FrinkApplet.html">Java Applet-based interface</a>.  It looks and
   works just like the GUI above, but it requires you to be connected to the
   internet and must download for each session.

   Your browser must support Java 1.3.1 or later, or you will need to get <a target="_blank" href="https://java.com/">download a newer version of Java
    from Sun.</a>  It is extremely highly recommended that you have Java 1.5.0
   update 2 or later.  This has been tested with Internet Explorer, Netscape
   4.x, Netscape 6+, Mozilla (Windows and Linux), and Opera.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you don&#39;t have a recent version of Java, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://java.com/">get it from Sun.</a> (Link opens in
   new window.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
   (The certificate is just signed by me, so you&#39;ll get a warning.
   Network access is necessary to use the network portions of Frink... like
   currency calculations, translations, etc.  If you deny network access, the
   non-network parts of Frink will work just fine.  If someone wants to send
   me the $400 necessary to get a VeriSign &#34;Code Signing Cerificate&#34;, I&#39;ll
   sign it just for you.  It won&#39;t work any differently.)
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="WebInterface">Web Interface</a></h3>
  <p>
   If the applet doesn&#39;t work for you, try the
   <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/frink.fsp">web interface.</a>
   It should allow you to use the latest version of the Frink engine.  It is
   now powered by <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/fspdocs.html">Frink Server Pages</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   In this web interface, you can enter any Frink expression in the &#34;From:&#34;
   box.  If you also enter a value in the &#34;To:&#34; box, it is treated as the
   right-hand side of a conversion expression (that is, to the right of the
   conversion operator <code>-&gt;</code> )
  </p>

  <p>
   Thus, to convert 10 meters to feet, you can enter
   <code>10 meters</code> in the &#34;From&#34; box and
   <code>feet</code> in the &#34;To&#34; box, or, equivalently, type
   <code>10 meters -&gt; feet</code> in the
   &#34;From&#34; box and leave the &#34;To&#34; box empty.  It does exactly the same thing.
  </p>


  <h2><a name="DownloadingFrink">Downloading Frink</a></h2>
  <p>
   <b>Quick Start:</b> On many platforms, if you already have Java installed,
   you can start Frink in the GUI mode by simply downloading and
   double-clicking the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frink.jar"><code>frink.jar</code></a> file.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   If you&#39;re just using Frink for interactive calculations, or are happy using
   the built-in programming mode and you&#39;re not writing running programs from
   the command-line, see the 
   <a href="#JavaWebStart">Java Web Start</a> section above.
  </p>

  <p>
   (If you&#39;re looking for an installer for handheld devices, like Android, see
   the <a href="#SmallDevices">Small Devices</a> section below.)
  </p>

  <p>
   If you want to write full Frink programs <em>and</em> run them from
   the commmand-line, you will need to get your own copy of Frink, and
   have a Java 1.1 or later runtime environment on your machine,
   1.4.2+ is recommended as it&#39;s less buggy.  The date calculations in
   anything before Java 1.3 are rather bad,) you may download the
   latest executable <code>jar</code> file.  (Note that this changes
   almost daily as I do more work, so download often.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Otherwise, here are the steps to downloading Frink:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>
    If you don&#39;t have a recent version of Java, you can <a target="_blank" href="https://java.com/">get it from Sun.</a> (Link opens in
    new window.)

   </li><li><a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frink.jar">Download frink.jar</a>.

   </li><li>(Double-clicking the file you just downloaded might start Frink in GUI
    mode, depending on your operating system.  If that&#39;s not enough, read on.)

   </li><li>
    See the <a href="#RunningFrink">Running Frink</a> section below for

  </li></ul>

  <p>
   (Note that the Linux/Unix shell script above has the option to run with
   the <code>rlwrap</code> program, which gives you the ability to use the
   up/down arrows to repeat and edit calculations, and even perform unit and
   function completion!  See the instructions inside that file for configuring
   rlwrap, and downloading the optional associated
   files:   <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/unitnames.txt">unitnames.txt</a> and <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/functionnames.txt">functionnames.txt</a>)

   In the samples below, you may need to replace <code>java</code> or
   <code>javaw</code> with the full path to your Java Virtual Machine,
   whatever that may be.  Note that <code>javaw</code> is a Windows-only
   command that simply starts Java without opening a console window.  You&#39;ll
   probably replace this with <code>java</code> on other platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
   The most general way to start Frink is to launch the
   <code>frink.gui.FrinkStarter</code> class:
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>java -cp frink.jar frink.gui.FrinkStarter
    <i>[options]</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   (The above starter scripts use this class.  Look at them first.)  By
   default, this starts in text mode but allows many command-line options to
   start in different modes:
  </p>
  
  <table summary="FrinkStarter options">
    <tbody><tr><th>Switch</th><th>Description
    </th></tr><tr><td>--swing</td><td>Starts in Swing GUI mode
    </td></tr><tr><td>--gui</td><td>Starts in Swing GUI mode
    </td></tr><tr><td>--awt</td><td>Starts in AWT GUI mode
    </td></tr><tr><td>--fullscreen</td><td>Starts fullscreen
    </td></tr><tr><td>--prog</td><td>Starts in programming mode with a blank program
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>-open <i>filename</i></td><td>Starts the specified filename
      in programming mode (this option is passed by double-clicking a file in
      Windows if you have file associations set up.)
    </td></tr><tr><td>-1</td><td>Starts Frink in Swing mode, using the one-line
      input mode (default is two-line input mode).  This is similar to
      starting Frink and choosing the menu item <b>Mode | One-Line</b> or
      hitting <code>Ctrl-1</code>.
    </td></tr><tr><td>-3</td><td>Starts Frink in Swing mode, using the multi-line
      input mode (default is two-line input mode.)  This is similar to
      starting Frink and choosing the menu item <b>Mode | Multi-Line</b> or
      hitting <code>Ctrl-3</code>.
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  <p>
   Other start options are listed below, if you want to use them.  I&#39;d suggest
   using one of the scripts above and modifying it.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   To run the jar file in text mode (only), use: </p>

  <p>
   To run the jar file with the Swing GUI, (shown above under
   <a href="#JavaWebStart">Java Web Start</a>,) use: </p>

  <p>
   The Swing GUI is the default action for the jar file, so this is the same as
   saying:</p>
  
  <p>
   To run the jar file with the AWT GUI, which gives access to several modes,
   including programming mode, use: </p>

  <p>
   To run the jar file and start the AWT GUI in programming mode, use: </p>

  <p>
   To run the jar file and start the Swing GUI in programming mode, use: </p>
  
  <p>
   If a single filename is specified in programming mode, this file will be
   loaded into the interface.
  </p>

  <p>
   To run the AWT GUI in full-screen size (this is primarily for small
   devices,) use: </p>

  <p>
   Depending on your operating system, I recommend that you write a shell
   script, batch file, or create a shortcut to let you run this even more
   easily (see below for samples.)  To exit, use Ctrl-C, or send your
   platform&#39;s end-of-file character (usually Ctrl-Z or Ctrl-D), possibly
   followed by carriage return.  Or just close the window.

  <h3><a name="CommandLineOptions">Command-Line Options</a></h3>
  <p>
   Arguments passed in on the command-line are treated as names of Frink
   programs to be executed.  Other command-line options are listed below.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   If you just want to have Frink calculate something and exit, you can pass
   arguments on the command line using the <code>-e <i>[string]</i></code>
   switch. Each command-line argument following the -e will be interpreted as
   a Frink expression, making it easy to run Frink from other applications:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>java -cp frink.jar frink.parser.Frink -e &#34;78 yards -&gt; feet&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   Other command-line options:
  </p>
  
  <table summary="Command-line options">
    <tbody><tr><th>Switch</th><th>Description

    </th></tr><tr><td>-f <i>filename</i></td><td> Allows you to specify
    multiple Frink source files to load and run.  Multiple <code>-f <i>filename</i></code> options may be specified.  If this option is
    specified, the specified file will <em>not</em> receive any following
    command-line arguments. <em>The <code>-f</code> switch is no longer
    required or recommended unless you are loading multiple files.</em>
    Normally, you will just specify the filename to load as the last
      command-line argument.
      <p>
       For example, to load your own definitions from
       <code>mydefs.frink</code> before loading the main program
       <code>main.frink</code>, you may do something like:
      </p>

      <p>
       <code>frink -f mydefs.frink main.frink <i>args</i></code>
      </p>
     </td>
     
   </tr><tr><td>-k</td><td>Remain in interactive mode
      after loading files or parsing command-line arguments.  This is very
      useful if you want to load definitions from one or more files and then
      go into an interactive session.

   </td></tr><tr><td>-u <i>filename</i></td><td>Specify a different
      units file than the default.  This allows you to change the fundamental
      dimensions that you like to use, or change my definitions that you don&#39;t
      agree with.  You can download my 
      <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkdata/units.txt">latest data file</a> (normally included
      in the <code>.jar</code> file) and modify it to suit your needs.</td>

    </tr><tr><td>--nounits</td><td>Don&#39;t load a units file at all
      on startup.  This will improve startup time, but will break all programs
      that use any of the standard units.  No units of measure will be defined
      at all.

    </td></tr><tr><td>-I <i>path</i></td>
     <td>Appends the specified path to the paths that will be searched when a
      <code>use</code> statement is encountered in a program.  This may be
      either an absolute or relative file path.  You may specify multiple
      <code>-I</code> arguments on the command-line, and the paths will be
      searched in the order they are specified.
     
    </td></tr><tr><td>--encoding <i>str</i>

     </td><td>Specify the character encoding of all following Frink program files.
     <em>This option must precede the filename that it modifies.</em> Frink
      programs can now be more directly written in any language and encoding
      system.  This switch is only necessary if your system&#39;s default encoding
      (as detected by Java) is different than that of the program file you&#39;re
      loading.

      <p>
       The encoding is a string representing any encoding that your version of
       Java supports, <i>e.g.</i> <code>&#34;UTF-8&#34;</code>,
       <code>&#34;US-ASCII&#34;</code>, <code>&#34;ISO-8859-1&#34;</code>,
       <code>&#34;UTF-16&#34;</code>, <code>&#34;UTF-16BE&#34;</code>,
       <code>&#34;UTF-16LE&#34;</code>.  Your release of Java may support more
       charsets, but all implementations of Java are required to support the
       above.  The sample program  
           <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=encodings.frink">encodings.frink</a> also demonstrates how to list all of the encodings available on your system (and 
   their aliases.)
      </p>      

      <p>
       If you specify multiple files having different encodings using multiple
       <code>-f</code> directives, you can use something like
       <code>--encoding &#34;&#34;</code> to set the encoding back to your
       system&#39;s default.
      </p>

      <p>
       This flag does <em>not</em> alter the behavior of files opened using
       commands like <code>read[]</code> or <code>lines[]</code>.  To change
       their behavior, use the
       <a href="#SpecifyingAlternateEncodings">two-argument versions of these
        commands.</a>
      </p>
     </td>

   </tr><tr><td><code>-v</code></td><td>Print out
      the Frink version and exit.  (From inside a program, you can call the
      function <code>FrinkVersion[]</code> to return the current version.)

   </td></tr><tr><td>--sandbox</td><td>Enables Frink&#39;s internal &#34;sandbox&#34; mode
    so you can run untrusted code.  This is different from Java&#39;s sandbox, in
    that it enables only Frink&#39;s notions of what should and shouldn&#39;t be 
    allowed.  It disallows programs to define functions and many other things,
    so it&#39;s rarely useful to the end-user, and hardly any programs will run
       this way.  It&#39;s really more for my testing.

   </td></tr><tr><td>--ignore-errors</td><td>Ignores syntax errors when parsing a
    program and attempts to ignore those lines and recover and run the
    program.  Generally a very bad idea, but this flag was added to preserve
    old, excessively-permissive behavior.

  <h3><a name="ExperimentalVersions">Experimental Versions</a></h3>
  <p>
   For those who want a standalone, all-in-one Frink download, there is an
   <em>experimental, unsupported</em> version of Frink compiled for Windows
   only using an experimental, unreleased version of the GNU compiler for Java
   (GCJ).  This only works in command-line mode, but requires no other
   downloads and may start up more quickly.  It is appropriate for quick
   calculations and command-line scripts.  Not all functions may work.  Let me
   know about parts that do or don&#39;t work for you.  It is compressed with UPX
   to reduce the file size (possibly at the cost of some startup time.)  This
   version starts up more quickly than the Sun JVM, but runs programs about
   5-6 times slower.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><b>Experimental, Unsupported</b> executable for Windows: <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frinkx.exe">frinkx.exe</a>.
  </li></ul>

  <p>(Unfortunately, it&#39;s compiled without optimization, because that pegs the
  CPU for over 72 minutes, and then blows out my system after trying to use
  over a gigabyte of virtual memory.  Anyone want to donate me a new computer
  with tons of memory?  Or try compiling it with -O3?)  For Windows, you can
  use this experimental <a href="http://www.thisiscool.com/gcc_mingw.htm#gcj43ecj">gcj 4.3
  eclipse-merge-branch</a> version.
  </p>
    
  <p>
   Hint:  If you install the gcj package linked above, or have a working GCJ
   (4.3 or later is required) for other platforms, the command line to
   compile with full optimization will be something like:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    gcj -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer --main=frink.parser.Frink -o frinkx.exe <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frink.jar">frink.jar</a>
   </code>
  </p>
   
  <h3><a name="SmallDevices">Small Devices</a></h3>
  <p>
   Frink can run entirely on handheld devices like the any phone running
   the Android platform, Sony Ericcson P800,
   P802, or P900 smartphone, the Nokia 92x0 Communicator (Nokia 9210,
   9210i, and 9290), and the Sharp Zaurus.
  </p>

  <p>
   The installer is built as part of the Frink release process, so these
   versions will be up-to-date with the latest Frink.  (The version numbers in
   the installers may not change, though.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Download the installer for the following platforms:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
   <li><b><a href="https://futureboy.us/temp/frink.apk">Android</a></b> - All of Frink&#39;s
    functionality, including graphics, is available on the Android mobile
    phone platform.  See the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/android.html">Frink on Android</a> page
    for more information on using Frink on Android.  As Android is a stable,
    complete, widely-available, well-designed, multi-platform and multi-vendor
    environment, it will probably be the primary platform for Frink on
    handheld devices in the future.  Other proprietary platforms that require
    extensive porting and packaging for every phone model may go away.
       
   </li><li><b><a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frink.sis">Sony Ericsson P800, P802 or P900, and

     9210, 9210i, and 9290)</a></b> (and perhaps other Symbian 6.0 devices
    with the &#34;Crystal&#34; (wide-screen) user interface).  You need 3 to 4
    megabytes of free memory to run Frink.

   </li><li><b><a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frink_arm.ipk">Sharp Zaurus</a></b> (despite the
    filename, this isn&#39;t ARM-processor specific--it&#39;s pure Java, and might
    work on other platforms that use the <code>.ipk</code> package format.)
    Note:  I need help testing and improving this installation package.
    Please contact <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">Alan Eliasen</a> if
    you have experience with Zaurus installer packages.  <i>Hint for
     helpers:</i>  an <code>.ipk</code> file is just a <code>.tar.gz</code>
    file, so you can open it up and poke around, but I don&#39;t have a Zaurus to
    test on.

   </li><li><b>Experimental:</b> <b><a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkjar/frink80.jar">Nokia 9300,

    devices.)  I need help testing this one.  The Series 80 devices evidently
    crash when you try to add menubars, so some functions are impossible to
    access.  This is a jar file customized for Series 80, and not an
    <code>.sis</code> installer.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   Notes about running Frink on other devices, including notes about why I
   probably <em>won&#39;t</em> provide releases for newer Symbian devices that
   require their &#34;Symbian Signed&#34; abomination, please see <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/faq.html#WillFrinkRun">this FAQ entry</a>.

  <p>
   If you have problems running any of these, please contact <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">Alan Eliasen</a>.  Since I don&#39;t own
   any of these devices, I rely on others for testing and detailed bug
   reports.  (The emulators don&#39;t always work like the real devices!)  It&#39;s
   possible for bugs to slip in that work under normal testing, but cause
   problems on the limited/different JVMs on these devices.
  </p>

  <p>
   If anyone knows of a Symbian 6.0 device with the &#34;Quartz&#34; user interface
   that supports PersonalJava, please let me know and I can give you an
   installer to test.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you know of a device that supports PersonalJava 1.1 or better, including
   the <code>java.math</code> package and floating-point math, and you think
   Frink would run on this device and you would like to help test it, please

   want to make a pared-down (or even empty) units file and use that when
   running your programs.

  <h3><a name="PerformanceTips">Performance Tips</a></h3>
  <p>
   There are several things you can do to make your Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
   run Frink more quickly:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>
    Java 8 contains my algorithmic improvements to make large integers work
    <em>much</em> more quickly for multiplication, base conversion, etc.  (It
    only took the Java people 11+ years to import my patches.)  If you want
    faster integer and decimal performance, make sure you are
    using <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/experimental.html">Frink:The Next Generation</a> and Java
    1.8 or later which uses my vastly improved algorithms.
    
   </li><li>For long-running programs, if you&#39;re using Sun&#39;s Java Virtual Machine
    (JVM), use the <code>-server</code> command-line switch to the
    <code>java</code> executable.  This starts the Server VM which optimizes
    more aggressively and often improves performance of long-running programs
    by a factor of 2, but at the expense of increased start-up time.  Note that
    the server VM may not be available if you just downloaded the Java Runtime
    Environment (JRE), and not the full Java Software Development Kit (SDK).

   </li><li>If you&#39;re <em>not</em> starting long-running programs, and want the
    fastest start-up time, <em>don&#39;t</em> use the Server VM.
    
   </li><li>Like all Java programs, Frink can often run much faster if you allow
    the JVM to use more memory at startup, leading to less-frequent garbage
    collection.  In Sun&#39;s implementation, this is achieved by passing the
    options <code>-Xmx<i>&lt;size&gt;</i></code> (for maximum Java heap size)
    and <code>-Xms<i>&lt;size&gt;</i></code> (for initial Java heap size) to
    the <code>java</code> executable.  The <i>size</i> arguments are something
    like <code>256M</code> for 256 megabytes.  Note that this is at the expense
    of other processes running on your system, and should be used sparingly
    because allocating too much memory may cause your system to swap
    excessively or run out of memory if set too high.
    
   </li><li>(<i>Probably obsolete</i>) If you&#39;re doing mostly large integer work
   (factoring, primality testing, other number theory,) where most of the
   runtime is spent in mathematical operations on very large integers, the <a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">Kaffe</a> Virtual Machine compiled with the
   incredibly fast <a href="https://gmplib.org/">GMP</a> numerical libraries
   works literally thousands of times faster than Sun&#39;s VM and its horribly
   naïve algorithms.
    
    <p><b>Warning:</b> Make sure that GMP is compiled with the
     configure option <code>--enable-alloca=malloc-reentrant</code> or you&#39;ll
     blow out the stack and crash with very large integers.

    </p><p><b>Warning:</b> As of the 2004-07-18 release of Kaffe, you must now
     explicitly pass the <code>-Xnative-big-math</code> argument when running
     Kaffe in order to use the GMP libraries.
  </p></li></ul>

  <h3><a name="ProxyConfiguration">Proxy Configuration</a></h3>
  <p>
   If you use a HTTP or FTP proxy server, you need to add some options to your
   command lines (say, right after the word <code>java</code>) to use the
   proxy if you want certain functions to work.  HTTP and FTP are used for the
   following:

  </p><ul>
   <li><a href="#TextTranslation">Language translations</a> (HTTP)
   </li><li><a href="#InternationalExchangeRates">Currency/Exchange Rate
     conversions</a> (HTTP, will fall back to static file if unavailable)
   </li><li><a href="#HistoricalUSPriceData">Historical values of the
     U.S. dollar</a> (FTP, will fall back to static file if unavailable)
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   The following are settings for Sun&#39;s distribution of Java 1.4.1.  You may
   need different options depending on your Java distribution.  See
   <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/net/properties.html">Sun&#39;s
    Networking Properties documentation</a> for more properties you may need
   if you&#39;re on a network that requires more proxy settings.
  </p>

  <p>
   HTTP proxy:</p>

  <p>
   FTP proxy:</p>

  <p>
   These settings should <em>not</em> be necessary when using the applet
   version or the Java Web Start version, as these inherit the proxy settings
   from your browser or the Java Web Start Application Manager respectively.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="HowFrinkIsDifferent">How Frink is Different</a></h2>
  <p>
   Frink is, first and foremost, designed to make it easy to figure out
   things.  If there&#39;s a unifying principle in Frink, it could be considered
   to be the <em>normalization of information</em>.  I&#39;m trying to
   simplify and unify the representation of data so that you can perform all
   sorts of interesting operations on them.  Whatever that means.
  </p>

  <p>
   Frink is optimized for doing quick, off-the-cuff calculations with a
   minimum of typing, primarily so it can be used with handheld devices which
   can make text entry difficult (especially symbols).  This doesn&#39;t mean that
   Frink is unsuitable for doing large, very high accuracy calculations.  It
   does those well, too, and the complicated calculations look just like the
   simple ones.
  </p>

  <p>
   To give an example, Frink represents <em>all</em> numerical quantities as
   not simply a number, but a number and the units of measurement that
   quantity represents.  So you can enter things such as &#34;3 feet&#34; or &#34;40
   acres&#34; or &#34;4 tons&#34;, and add, subtract, multiply, etc. these things
   together.  Frink will track the resulting quantities through all
   calculations, eliminating a large category of errors.  You can add feet,
   meters, or rods all in the same calculation and the details are handled
   transparently and correctly.
  </p>

  <p>
   It also knows the ways that these units are interrelated-- a length times a
   length is an area; length<sup>3</sup> is a volume (if you believe in the
   hypothetical Z axis); mass times distance times acceleration is energy.  If
   you know something in one system of measurement you can convert it to any
   other system of measurement.
  </p>

  <p>
   All units are standardized and normalized into combinations a small number
   of several &#34;Fundamental Dimensions&#34; that cannot be reduced any further.
   These are completely arbitrary and configurable but are currently:
  </p>

  <p>
   Look at the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkdata/units.txt">data file</a> for these
   definitions (and my editorializing on the boneheadedness of many these
   choices.)  The data file recursively defines all measurements in terms of
   the fundamental units.
  </p>

  <p>
   An exponent can be attached to each dimension.  For example, an area is
   length * length which might be represented as <code>meters^2</code>.  Of
   course, a negative exponent indicates <em>division</em> by that quantity,
   so meters/second will be displayed as <code>m s^-1</code>, or acceleration
   (which can be represented as meters per second per second) is represented
   as <code>m s^-2</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   A subtle but important design goal of Frink is to &#34;do the right thing&#34; with
   numbers.  Numeric values are automatically promoted to and from integers,
   rational numbers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers and more, all
   without overflow or undefined behavior or rounding error.  Frink tries to
   get the <em>right</em> answer, not the wrong answer as fast as possible.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="NumericTypes">Numeric Types</a></h2>
  <p>
   Numeric values in Frink are represented in one of several ways:
  </p>

  <dl>
   <dt>Integer</dt> <dd>An arbitrarily large number with no decimal part.
   Represented as a number with no decimal point, (<i>e.g.</i>
   <code>1000000000</code>) or the special &#34;exact exponent&#34; form
   <code>1ee9</code>.  An integer can also contain underscores for better
   readability, <i>e.g.</i> <code>1_000_000_000</code></dd>
   
   <dt>Rational</dt>
   <dd>An arbitrarily large number which can be written as
    integer/integer ( such as <code>1/3</code> or <code>22/7</code> ).
    Rational numbers are first reduced to smallest terms; that is,
    <code>2/10</code> is stored as <code>1/5</code> and <code>5/5</code> is
    stored as the integer <code>1</code></dd>
   
   <dt>Floating Point</dt>
   <dd>An arbitrary-precision floating-point number.
    Currently, the number of decimal places calculated or displayed is limited
    to 20 for efficiency reasons.  Any number containing a decimal point is a
    floating-point number, such as <code>1.</code> or <code>1.01132</code>, as
    well as any approximate exponential such as <code>2e10</code> or
    <code>6.02e23</code>.
    
    <p>
     As of the 2018-12-11 release, if a number with a decimal point has the
     &#34;exact exponent&#34; indicator <code>ee</code>, it is turned into an exact
     rational number or integer.  For example, the new exact SI value for
     Avogadro&#39;s number <code>6.02214076ee23</code> will become an exact
     integer.  The exponents can also be negative, which will usually lead to
     an exact rational number, such as <code>6ee-1</code> which produces the
     exact rational number <code>3/5 (exactly 0.6)</code>.
    </p> 
   </dd>

   <dt>Complex Numbers</dt>
   <dd>Complex numbers are any number with an imaginary part.  The imaginary
    unit is specified by the symbol <code>i</code>.  For example, <code>40 +
     3 i</code>.  The real and imaginary parts of a complex number can be any
    of the numerical types listed above.</dd>

   <dt>Intervals</dt>
   <dd>An interval represents a range of values, such as <code>[2.1, 3]</code>
    where, depending on your interpretation, the actual number is unknown, but
    contained within this range, or the number simultaneously takes on all
    values within the range.  See the <a href="#IntervalArithmetic">Interval
    Arithmetic</a> section of the documentation for more information.</dd>
  </dl>


  <h2><a name="DataLibraries">Data Libraries</a></h2>

   Frink knows about a wide variety of measurements.  You can usually type a
   unit of measurement in a variety of ways.  Plurals are usually understood.
   Case is important (and somewhat arbitrary until I do some normalization and
   cleanup of the units file, but usually lowercase is your best choice.)  The

   If you&#39;re looking for a specific unit, and don&#39;t know how it&#39;s spelled or
   capitalized, see the <a href="#IntegratedHelp">Integrated Help</a> section
   below.
  </p>

  <p>
   Or, if you&#39;re using the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/frink.fsp">web interface</a>,
   type part or all of the name in the &#34;Lookup:&#34; field and click &#34;lookup&#34;.
   Selecting the &#34;exact&#34; checkbox will only return exact matches, otherwise
   you will get all lines containing that substring.  Try it for something
   like &#34;<a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/frink.fsp?lookup=cubit">cubit</a>&#34; and you&#39;ll see that
   there are often lots of variations.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Important:</b> You&#39;ll learn the most if you look at the voluminous and
   fascinating <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkdata/units.txt">data file</a> for more examples
   of things you can do, and measurements that Frink knows about.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="IntegratedHelp">Integrated Help</a></h2>
  <p>
   If you don&#39;t know the name of a unit or function, but can guess at it, you
   can either read the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkdata/units.txt">data file</a> for more
   information, or use the integrated help.  Keep in mind that Frink is
   case-sensitive, so you&#39;ll need to use the right capitalization of the names.
  </p>

  <p>
   Unit or function names can be looked up by preceding part or all of the
   name with a question mark.  This will return a list of all units and
   function names <em>containing</em> that string, in upper- or lower-case.
   For example, to find the different types of cubits:
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>?cubit</code></p>

  <p>
   Or, if you want to know the name of the currency used in Iran,
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>?iran</code></p>

  <p>
   Simply enter the name of the unit you&#39;re interested in to see its value:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>biblicalcubit</code></p>

  <p>
   If you want to see the results in specific units of measurement, you
   can use the arrow operator <code>-&gt;</code> as described in the
   <a href="#Conversions">Conversions</a> section below:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>biblicalcubit -&gt; inches</code></p>

  <p>
   Or, if you want to see the sizes of all the units as a single unit type,
   and they&#39;re all the same, you can use the arrow operator on the list.  The
   following sample shows all the different types of cubits the world
   has defined and converts them to inches:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>?cubit -&gt; inches</code></p>

  <p>
   If you don&#39;t want to see exact fractions, you can (as always) multiply the
   right-hand-side by <code>1.0</code> or <code>1.</code> (without a zero
   after the decimal point) to get approximate numbers:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>?cubit -&gt; 1.0 inches</code><br/>
  </p>

  <p>
   If you use two question marks, the units that match that pattern will be
   displayed <em>and their values in the <a href="#SettingDisplayUnits">current
     display units</a>:</em>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>??moon</code></p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> If you use the form with two question marks, you
   <em>cannot</em> convert them to a specified unit with the
   <code>-&gt;</code> operator, as they have already been converted to a
   single string.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> As of the 2016-07-06 release, the double-question-mark
   operator now returns <em>a single string</em> with newlines separating each
   entry, instead of a list of strings.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that functions are displayed at the end of the list, and can be
   distinguished from units by the square brackets following them:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>??call</code></p>

  <p>
   In addition, the <code>functions[]</code> function will produce a list of
   all functions.

  <h2><a name="EditingFrink">Editing Frink</a></h2>

   If you&#39;re writing Frink programs, you can edit Frink files in your favorite

   rudimentary <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinktools/emacs/frink-mode.el">Frink mode for
    Emacs</a>.  It&#39;s somewhat rough at this moment, but it has syntax

  <h2><a name="Conversions">Conversions</a></h2>
  <p>
   By default, the output is in terms of the &#34;fundamental units&#34;.  To convert
   to whatever units you want, simply use the &#34;arrow&#34; operator
   <code>-&gt;</code> (that&#39;s a minus sign followed by a greater-than sign,)
   with the target units on the right-hand side:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>38 feet -&gt; meters</code></p>

  <p>
   <b>Formatting Shortcut:</b> If the right-hand-side of the conversion is in
   double quotes, the conversion operator will both evaluate the value in
   quotes as a unit and append the quoted value to the result.  So, the above
   example could be performed as:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>38 feet -&gt; &#34;meters&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   In this case, because the ratio between feet and meters is an
   exactly-defined quantity, so the answer comes out as an exact rational
   number.  This is also displayed as a decimal number for your convenience.
   If you just want the decimal value, you can multiply by an approximate
   decimal number (any number containing a decimal point) such as
   <code>1.0</code> or <code>1.</code> without anything after the 
   decimal point:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>38. feet -&gt; &#34;meters&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> If you are using the web-based interface, simply enter
   everything left of the arrow in the &#34;From:&#34; box and everything to the right
   of the arrow in the &#34;To:&#34; box.  Or you can enter the whole expression
   <em>including</em> the arrow in the &#34;From:&#34; box and leave the &#34;To:&#34; box
   empty.  It does the exact same thing.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the units on either side of a conversion are not of the same type, Frink
   may try to help you by suggesting conversion factors:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>55 mph -&gt; yards</code></p>

  <p>
   If you get an error like this, you can list all the units that have the
   specified dimensions by typing <code>units[time]</code> or
   <code>units[frequency]</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   Yes, sometimes it gives digits which aren&#39;t significant in results.  As I
   improve the symbolic reduction of expressions, this will get better,
   although I still need to work out ways of specifying and tracking precision
   (and uncertainty?) throughout all calculations.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="MultipleConversions">Multiple Conversions</a></h3>
  <p>
   If the right-hand-side of the conversion is a comma-separated list in
   square brackets, the value will be broken down into the constituent
   units.  For example, to find out how long it takes the earth to rotate on
   its axis:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>siderealday -&gt; [hours, minutes, seconds]</code></p>

  <p>
   or, to maintain symmetry with the quoted-right-hand-side behavior noted
   above, arguments on the right-hand-side can be quoted:
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>siderealday -&gt; [&#34;hours&#34;, &#34;minutes&#34;, &#34;seconds&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   This behavior can also be used to break fractions into constituent parts:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>13/4 -&gt; [1,1]</code></p>

  <p>
   If the first term is the integer <code>0</code> (zero), any leading terms
   with zero magnitude will be suppressed:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>siderealday -&gt; [0, &#34;weeks&#34;, &#34;days&#34;, &#34;hours&#34;, &#34;minutes&#34;, &#34;seconds&#34;]</code></p>
  
  <p>
   If the last term is the integer <code>0</code> (zero), any remaining
   fractional part  will be suppressed:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>siderealday -&gt; [&#34;hours&#34;, &#34;minutes&#34;, &#34;seconds&#34;, 0]</code></p>

  <h2><a name="MathOperators">Math Operators</a></h2>
  <p>
   Math is very straightforward: the current parser accepts the normal
   mathematical operators, with normal operator precedence.  (Exponentiation
   first (see notes below,) then multiplication and division, then addition
   and subtraction.  And more tightly parenthesized expressions are performed
   before anything else.)  All expressions can be arbitrarily complex.
   Parentheses can be used to group expressions.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Important:</b> Whitespace between any two units implies multiplication!
   This has the same precedence as multiplication or division.  If there&#39;s one
   thing you need to keep in mind, it&#39;s this.  You <em>must</em> parenthesize
   units on the right-hand-side of a division operation, if you expect them to
   be multiplied before the division takes place.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following are all valid expressions.  (Note
   that if you are using the web-based interface you can enter the right-hand
   side of the arrow operator in the &#34;To:&#34; box.)

       feet)^3</code>, indicating a cube 3 feet on a side, or 27 cubic feet.
      This cubes the multiplicative terms on its left-hand-side.  Cubed has a
      precedence between multiplication and addition.
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> If a number comes out as a fraction, like
   <code>20/193209</code>, you can get a decimal result by repeating the
   calculation with a non-integer number (that is, one with a decimal point in
   it like <code>20./193209</code>) or by multiplying by <code>1.0</code>, or
   simply <code>1.</code> (without anything after the decimal point.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Both sides of a conversion can be arbitrarily complex.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Factorials">Factorials</a></h3>
  <p>
   The implementation of factorials is subtle and important enough to warrant
   a few notes.  The factorial operator <code>!</code>
   follows after an expression and has a precedence <em>above</em>
   exponentiation, following normal mathematical precedence rules.  Yeah, when
   I say <code>6!</code> or <code>n!</code> or <code>(n-m)!</code>, I&#39;m not
   just being super-enthusiastic about that number.  It&#39;s a common
   mathematical operator.
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>Reminder:</i> the factorial of a non-negative integer <code>n!</code> is
   the product of all the numbers from <code>1</code> to <code>n</code>.  For
   example, the factorial <code>6!</code> is equal to
   <code>1*2*3*4*5*6=720</code>.  These grow rapidly and become hard to
   calculate, but Frink calculates them exactly.
  </p>

  <p>
   Here are some notes about the implementation of factorials:
  
  </p><ul>
   <li>Factorials are calculated once and cached in memory so further
    recalculation is fast.

   </li><li>There is a limit to the size of factorials that gets cached in memory.
    Currently this limit is <code>10000!</code>.  Numbers larger than this
    will not be cached, but re-calculated on demand.

   </li><li>When calculating a factorial within the caching limit, say,
    <code>5000!</code>, all of the factorials smaller than this will get
    calculated and cached in memory.

   </li><li>As of the 2017-04-04 release, calculations of huge factorials larger
    than the cache limit <code>10000!</code> are now calculated by a <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=BinarySplittingFactorial.frink">binary splitting
     algorithm</a> which makes them significantly faster on Java 1.8 and later.
    (Did you know that Java 1.8&#39;s BigInteger calculations got drastically
    faster because Frink&#39;s internal algorithms were contributed to it?)

   </li><li>As of the 2017-04-04 release, functions that calculate binomial
     coefficients like <code>binomial[<i>m,n</i>]</code> are more efficient
     because of the use of <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=BinarySplittingFactorial.frink">binary
     splitting algorithms,</a> especially for large numbers.

     <p>
       <b>Note:</b>  <code>binomial[<i>m,n</i>]</code> is of the number of ways
       <code>m</code> things can be chosen <code>n</code> at a time, with
       order being unimportant.  This is sometimes called &#34;m choose n&#34; or &#34;m C
       n&#34;.  This is equivalent to <code>m!/(n! (m-n)!)</code> although
       calculating that way 
       often leads to way-too-big numbers.  For example, <code>binomial[10000,
         9998]</code> is equal to 49995000, but if you calculated it naively,
       you&#39;d have to calculate 10000! which is a 35660-digit number, and divide
       it by another huge number, which could be inefficient and slow.
     
     </p></li><li>The function <code>factorialRatio[<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>]</code> allows
    <em>efficient</em> calculation of the ratio of two factorials <code>a! /
     b!</code>, using a <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=BinarySplittingFactorial.frink">binary
     splitting algorithm</a>.
  </li></ul>

  <h2><a name="Variables">Variables</a></h2>
  <p>
   By default, all variables in Frink can contain any type.  Variable names
   begin with any (Unicode) letter followed by 0 or more letters, digits, or
   the underscore (<code>_</code>) character.
  </p>

  <p>
   You do not need to declare variables before using them.  The variable will
   be defined in the smallest containing scope.
  </p>

  <p>
   To assign a value to a variable, use the <code>=</code> operator:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = 10 feet</code>  (assigns a single value)</p>

  <h3><a name="DeclaringVariables">Declaring Variables</a></h3>
  <p>
   Variables <em>may</em> be declared before they are used using the
   <code>var</code> keyword.  For example, to
   declare a variable called <code>t</code>:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>var t</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This defines the variable t in the smallest containing scope and sets its
   initial value to the special value <code>undef</code>.  You may also
   specify an initial value:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>var t = 10 seconds</code>
  </p>

  <h3><a name="ConstraintsOnVariables">Constraints on Variables</a></h3>
  <p>
   When a variable is declared, you can constrain the type of values that it
   can contain.  The constraints are checked at runtime.  If you try to set a
   value that does not meet the constraints, a runtime error occurs.  For
   example, to make sure that the variable <code>t</code> only contains values
   with dimensions of time, you can declare it using the <code>is</code>
   keyword which defines constraints.
  </p>
    
  <p>
   <code>var t is time = 10 seconds</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   In this case, the initial value is necessary to ensure that <code>t</code>
   contains a value with dimensions of time <em>at all times</em>.  (The
   special value <code>undef</code> is applied if no initial value is
   supplied.)  If a valid initial value is not supplied, this will produce an
   error at runtime.
  </p>

  <p>
   Multiple constraints can be specified by placing them in square brackets.
   <em>All</em> constraints must be met.  (If you want to do an &#34;OR&#34; of
   constraints, see the <a href="#ConstraintFunctions">Constraint
    Functions</a> section below.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>var t is [time, positive] = 10 seconds</code>
  </p>
  
  <h4><a name="ConstrainingByDimensions">Constraining by Dimensions</a></h4>
  <p>
   Built-in constraint types include all of the dimension types defined in
   your program.  For example, you can list all of the defined dimension types
   (<i>e.g.</i> <code>length, mass, power, energy</code>) with the
   <code>dimensions[]</code> or the <code>dimensionsWithValues[]</code>
   functions.  All of these defined types can be used as constraints.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="ConstrainingToBuiltInTypes">Constraining to Built-In Types</a></h4>
  <p>
   The following built-in constraints can be used to verify that the value is
   of one of the built-in types.  For example,
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>var name is string = &#34;Frink&#34;</code>
  </p>

  <table summary="Built-in Constraint Types">
    <tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description
    </th></tr><tr><td>array</td><td>Value must be an <a href="#Arrays">array</a>.
    </td></tr><tr><td>boolean</td><td>Value must be a boolean value
      <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> (and not just
      a type that can be coerced to boolean; see the <a href="#Truth">Truth</a> section.)
    </td></tr><tr><td>date</td><td>Value must be a <a href="#DateTimeHandling">date/time</a>.
    </td></tr><tr><td>dict</td><td>Value must be a <a href="#Dictionaries">dictionary</a>.
    </td></tr><tr><td>set</td><td>Value must be a <a href="#Sets">set</a>.
    </td></tr><tr><td>regexp</td><td>Value must be a <a href="#RegularExpressions">regular expression</a>.
    </td></tr><tr><td>subst</td><td>Value must be a <a href="#SearchAndReplace">substitution</a> (search-and-replace) expression.
    </td></tr><tr><td>string</td><td>Value must be a <a href="#Strings">string</a>.
    </td></tr><tr><td>unit</td><td>Value must be a <a href="#DataLibraries">unit of measure</a> of any type (including
      dimensionless numbers).  You will probably use this rarely; it&#39;s more
      likely that you&#39;ll want to constrain based on <a href="#ConstrainingByDimensions">dimension type</a>.
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  <h4><a name="ConstrainingByObjectType">Constraining by Object Type</a></h4>
  <p>
   A class name can also be a constraint name.  If, for example, you&#39;ve
   defined a class called <code>Sphere</code>, the following will work.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a is Sphere = new Sphere[]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This constraint check also works with interface names.  If the name of the
   constraint is the name of an interface, this check will ensure that any
   object assigned to the variable implements that interface.  See the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=interfacetest.frink">interfacetest.frink</a> file for an example.
  </p>
  
  <h4><a name="ConstraintFunctions">Constraint Functions</a></h4>
  <p>
   You may define your own functions that will be used as constraints.  The
   function must take one argument and return a <code>true</code> value if the
   constraint is met.  Returning <code>false</code> or another value will
   cause the constraint to fail.  The following defines a function called
   <code>positive</code> that returns <code>true</code> if a value is a
   positive dimensionless value.
  </p>

  
  
  <h3><a name="TestingVariables">Testing Variables</a></h3>
  <p>
   You can test to see if a variable is defined using the following functions:
  </p>

  <table summary="Variable Testing Functions">
    <tbody><tr><th>Function</th><th>Definition
    </th></tr><tr><td>isDefined[<i>x</i>]</td><td>Returns true if the symbol is
      defined either as a local variable in the current scope (i.e. with the
      <code>=</code> operator), or as a unit (i.e. with the <code>:=</code>
      operator.)
    </td></tr><tr><td>isVariableDefined[<i>x</i>]</td><td>Returns true if the
      symbol is defined as a local variable in the current scope (i.e. with the
      <code>=</code> operator).
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  <p>
   Both functions can be called either with a raw variable name or with a
   string.  For example:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    isVariableDefined[a]</code>
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="GlobalVariables">Global Variables</a></h3>
  <p>
   Ha ha...just kidding.  There are no global variables in Frink.  However, if
   you need to access some sort of &#34;global&#34; values from anywhere in your
   program, without passing them explicitly to each function, you can simulate
   it with class-level variables in a class that you define.  These are
   defined using the <code>class var</code> keywords, and are similar to
   <code>static</code> class-level variables in languages like C++ and Java.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you want to use a &#34;global&#34; variable in only a few functions, you can
   encapsulate those functions into a <code>class</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   For samples of class-level variables and how to access them, see <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=classtest.frink">classtest.frink</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="UnicodeInFrink">Unicode in Frink</a></h3>
  <p>
   For internationalization, Frink allows <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a> characters anywhere.  For
   maximum portability, and maximum editability with non-Unicode-aware
   editors, you can use Unicode escapes to embed these characters in program
   files.

  </p><p>
   Variable names can contain Unicode characters, indicated by
   <code>\u</code> followed by exactly 4 hexadecimal digits [0-9a-fA-F]
   indicating the Unicode code-point, for example: <code>\u210e</code> .  In
   addition, a Unicode character can be specified with anywhere from one to
   six hexadecimal digits by placing the digits in brackets, for example:
   <code>\u{FF}</code> or <code>\u{1f638}</code> (this is the Unicode
   character &#34;GRINNING CAT FACE WITH SMILING EYES&#34;.  So, yes, you can have
   kitty faces as variable names!)  This allows Unicode characters to be
   placed into any ASCII text file, and edited by programs that don&#39;t
   understand Unicode.  It also allows <em>any</em> Unicode character to be
   used in an identifier.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you <em>do</em> have a nifty editor that handles Unicode, or other
   character encodings, you can write your Frink program in full Unicode, and
   load it using the <a href="#CommandLineOptions"><code>--encoding
    <i>str</i></code></a> command-line switch.  Keep in mind that in this
   case, identifiers can only consist of Unicode letters, digits, &#34;other
   symbols&#34; and the underscore.  You still have to use the <code>\u00a5</code>
   Unicode escape trick if your identifier contains other classes of
   characters.
  </p>

  <p>
   For example, Unicode defines the character <code>\u201e</code> for Planck&#39;s
   constant.  In the data file, we define Planck&#39;s constant as the normal
   character <code>h</code> (which is easier to type) and also as the Unicode
   character.  These definitions look like:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    h := 6.62606876e-34 J s</code> </p>

  <p>
   <em>Note:</em> The <code>:=</code> notation simply defines a
   <em>global</em> unit, that is available from all functions.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="SettingDisplayUnits">Setting Display Units</a></h2>
  <p>
   By default, units are displayed with their dimensions given as multiples of
   the
   <a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/units.html">International System
    of Units (SI)</a> base units.  These are often not very intuitive.  For
   example, volts are displayed as:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>1 volt</code></p>

  <p>
   Of course, you could convert to volts explicitly using the
   <code>-&gt;</code> operator, but if you have to do that repeatedly, it&#39;s a
   hassle.  Instead, you can define the default output format for a unit type
   by using the <code>:-&gt;</code> operator:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>electric_potential :-&gt; &#34;volts&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   The left-hand side is the dimension list identifier like
   <code>electric_potential</code> or <code>time</code> or <code>power</code>
   (you can see what this is named for any given unit by entering an
   expression of that type--see the first &#34;volt&#34; sample above.)
  </p>

  <p>
   The right-hand side is any expression that can go on the right-hand-side of
   a conversion operator <code>-&gt;</code> , including multiple conversions:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>time :-&gt; [0, &#34;days&#34;, &#34;hours&#34;, &#34;minutes&#34;, &#34;seconds&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   The right-hand-side can even be a function that takes a single argument:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>HMS[x] := x -&gt; [0, &#34;hours&#34;, &#34;minutes&#34;, &#34;seconds&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   If you want, you can define a function that displays distances in
   millimeters if it&#39;s small, kilometers if it&#39;s bigger, and light-years if
   it&#39;s huge.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="SettingPrecision">Setting Precision</a></h2>
  <p>
   Floating-point calculations are performed to a limited number of digits.
   You can change the number of digits of working precision by the
   <code>setPrecision[<i>digits</i>]</code> function:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    setPrecision[50]</code>
   <code>0.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that this will only affect calculations performed <em>after</em> this
   flag is set, of course.  Currently, not all operations (notably
   trigonometric functions) can be performed to arbitrary precision.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also see the current working precision by calling the
   <code>getPrecision[]</code> function:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    getPrecision[]<br/>
   </code>
   <code>50</code>
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="SettingNumberFormats">Setting Number Formats</a></h2>
  <p>
   By default, floating-point numbers are displayed in scientific notation
   with one digit before the decimal point.  This can be changed to
   &#34;engineering&#34; format where 1 to 3 digits are placed before the decimal
   point and the exponent is a multiple of 3.  This allows you to more easily
   see it as &#34;milli-&#34;, &#34;micro-&#34;, &#34;million&#34;, etc.  The call to enable this is:
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>setEngineering[true]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Example without engineering mode:
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>d = 140.5 million meters</code></p>

  <p>
   Now notice the change if you set &#34;engineering mode&#34; to true.  The result
   comes out so you can more easily read it as &#34;140.5 million meters&#34;:

  </p><p>
    <code>setEngineering[true]</code></p>

  <p>
   In addition, rational numbers are, by default, displayed with a
   floating-point approximation to their values:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>1/10</code></p>
  
  <p>
   <code>1/3</code></p>

  <p>
   This behavior can be suppressed by calling
   <code>showApproximations[<i>false</i>]</code>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>showApproximations[<i>false</i>]</code></p>

  <p>
   You can tell Frink to always <em>display</em> rational numbers as
   floating-point approximations by calling
   <code>rationalAsFloat[true]</code>.  The numbers will still continue to be
   represented internally as rational numbers.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>rationalAsFloat[<i>true</i>]</code></p>

  <p>
   Frink tries to produce a human-readable description of units of measure,
   such as &#34;power&#34; or &#34;energy&#34; or &#34;temperature&#34;:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>1 K</code></p>

  <p>
   This suggestion can be suppressed by calling
   <code>showDimensionName[false]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>showDimensionName[false]</code></p>

  <h2><a name="Comments">Comments</a></h2>
  <p>
   Frink allows C/C++/Java-style comments:
  </p>

  

  <p>
   <code>a = 1 </code>
  </p>
  

  <h2><a name="Functions">Functions</a></h2>
  <p>
   If you repeat a calculation, you may want to define it as a function.
   Functions in Frink are denoted by the function name followed by arguments
   in square brackets, separated by commas.  A function can be defined like
   the following:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>circlearea[radius] := pi radius^2</code><br/>
  </p>

  <p>
   Then, to call the function, say, to find the area of my telescope mirror,
   which has a radius of 2 inches:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>circlearea[2 inches]</code></p>

  <p>
   But that comes out in standard units... let&#39;s try again, converting to
   square inches.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>circlearea[2 inches] -&gt; in^2</code></p>

  <p>
   You may define multiple functions with the same name but different number
   of arguments.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="MultiLineFunctions">Multi-line Functions</a></h3>
  <p>
   Multi-line functions can be built; just put the body in curly braces.  It
   may be more legible to use the <code>return</code> statement in your
   function.  For example, the factorial function could be written as:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
   factorial[x] :=</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If a function does not explicitly return a value, the value returned is the
   value of the last expression evaluated.  A <code>return</code> statement
   with no value on the right-hand-side returns a special void type.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="DefaultValues">Default Values</a></h3>
  <p>
   Function declarations can have default values.  Default values are
   specified by putting &#34;<code>= <i>value</i></code>&#34; after a parameter name
   in the function declaration.  For example, if your Willard pocket organizer
   goes out, you can use Frink to calculate the tip on your dinner check, and,
   to make it easy, you can default the tip rate to 15 percent of the bill.
   The function declaration with default parameters is:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>tip[amount, rate=15 percent] := amount * rate</code><br/>
  </p>

  <p>
   Now, when you get to the restaurant, you can easily calculate the tip using
   the default rate:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>tip[80.75 dollars]</code></p>

  <p>
   Or, if service is outstanding and you want to tip at 20%, you can specify
   the second argument instead of leaving it at the default:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>tip[80.75 dollars, 20 percent]</code></p>

  <h3><a name="MultipleReturnValues">Multiple Return Values</a></h3>
  <p>
   The previous tip example probably has you thinking, &#34;Well, it would be nice
   if it calculated the total too!&#34;  I&#39;m bad at math, also... that&#39;s why I&#39;m
   developing Frink.
  </p>

  <p>
   In Frink, values surrounded by square brackets and separated by commas form
   a list of values.  These lists can be returned from a function, assigned to
   a variable, or whatever.  A better version of the above function would
   be defined to return a list containing the tip <em>and</em> the total as a
   list:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>tipandtotal[amount, rate=15 percent] := [amount * rate,
   amount * (1+rate)]</code><br/>
  </p>

  <p>
   Note the square brackets on the right-hand-side of the definition.  Then, to
   calculate the tip, it&#39;s as easy as before:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>tipandtotal[80.75 dollars]</code></p>

  <p>
   I&#39;ll let you do the rounding in your head, or you can use the
   <a href="#RoundingFunctions">rounding functions</a> below.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="RecursiveFunctions">Recursive Functions</a></h3>
  <p>
   Yes indeedy-o, functions can be recursive.  The classic example is the
   factorial:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>factorial[x] := x&gt;1  ?  x factorial[x-1]  :  1</code><br/>
  </p>

  <p>
   This uses the conditional expression <code>condition ? trueClause :
    falseClause</code>.  The condition is first evaluated (it should evaluate
   to a boolean value,) and if it&#39;s true, the true clause is evaluated and
   returned, the false clause otherwise.  Let&#39;s try a big number, just big
   enough that it would overflow my old solar calculator:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>factorial[70]</code></p>

  <p>
   You can still blow out the stack if you go too deep, or forget to put in a
   condition such that the function terminates.  Don&#39;t come crying to me.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="ConstrainingFunctionArguments">Constraining Function Arguments</a></h3>
  <p>
   Like other variables, formal arguments to functions can have constraints.
   The syntax for constraining is just the same as setting <a href="#ConstraintsOnVariables">Constraints on variables.</a>  For example,
   if you want to make sure that a function that calculates the volume of a
   sphere is passed a radius, the declaration looks like:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>sphereVolume[radius is length] := 4/3 pi radius^3</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The constraint(s) are checked at runtime, and if all constraints are not
   met, the function call produces an error.
  </p>

  <p>
   At some point in the future, I&#39;d like to have this choose an appropriate
   function based on the constraints, if more than one is possible.  My
   underlying function dispatching is designed to allow this, but functions
   with constraints may be slower to resolve.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="IfThenElse">If/Then/Else</a></h2>
  <p>
   You can control program flow with the if/then/else construct.  If the
   condition is true, it will execute the first clause, otherwise, if there is
   an (optional) <code>else</code> clause, it will execute the
   <code>else</code> clause.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    if a&lt;10</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> Note that putting the brackets and statements on separate
   lines is currently important.  Also, please note that the <code>else</code>
   keyword goes on the same line as the closing bracket of the
   <code>then</code> clause.
  </p>

  <p>
   If either the <code>then</code> or <code>else</code> clause is a single
   line, the curly braces for that clause can be eliminated.  The following is
   the same as the code above:
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>
    if a&lt;10</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The condition must be able to be turned into a boolean value.  When testing
   for equality, be sure to use the double equals sign, (a single equals
   indicates assignment) <i>e.g.</i>:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    if a==b</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If, for some reason, you need to jam everything into one line, you need to
   add the <code>then</code> keyword:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    if a==b then println[&#34;Equal.&#34;] else println[&#34;Not equal.&#34;]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Alternatively, there is a conditional operator (sometimes called the
   &#34;ternary operator&#34;) that can be placed inside an expression.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    <i>condition</i> ? <i>trueClause</i> : <i>falseClause</i>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If <code>condition</code> evaluates to <code>true</code>, then the result
   is <code>trueClause</code>, otherwise the result
   is <code>falseClause</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   The ternary conditional operator can be used in any expression:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    println[&#34;I have $numCats &#34; + ( numCats == 1 ? &#34;cat&#34; : &#34;cats&#34; ) + &#34;.&#34;]
   </code>
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Truth">Truth</a></h2>
  <p>
   The condition in an if/then/else statement or a loop needs to be a boolean
   (true/false) value.  This can either be represented by the special values
   <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, or the following types can be
   used in places where a boolean value is required:
  </p>

  <table summary="Boolean-Equivalent Expressions">
    <tbody><tr><th>True</th><th>False
    </th></tr><tr><td>true</td><td>false
    </td></tr><tr><td>Any non-empty string</td><td>The empty string <code>&#34;&#34;</code>
    </td></tr><tr><td>Any list (even a zero-element list)</td><td>
    </td></tr><tr><td></td><td>The special undefined value <code>undef</code>
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  <p>
   Any other value will cause a runtime error.  See the <a href="#BooleanOperators">Boolean Operators</a> section below for operators
   that return boolean values.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Loops">Loops</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="WhileLoop">While Loop</a></h3>
  <p>
   The <code>while</code> loop is a loop with a condition and a body.  The
   body is executed repeatedly while the condition is true.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    i=0</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If the body is a single line, the braces can be omitted:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    i=0</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can use the <code>next</code> statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a <code>while</code> loop.  You can use a labeled
   <code>next</code> statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher
   loop.  See the <a href="#ForLoop">for loop</a> section for an
   example.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   You can use the <code>break</code> statement to exit the smallest
   containing loop.  You can also use labeled break statements to break out to
   a higher loop:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    i=0</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The label must precede the loop <em>on a separate line</em> and be followed
   by a colon.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="UntilLoop">Until Loop</a></h3>
  <p>
   The <code>until</code> loop is a loop with a condition and a body.  The
   body is executed repeatedly until the condition is true.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    i=0</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If the body is a single line, the braces can be omitted:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    i=0</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can break out of an <code>until</code> loop using <code>break</code>
   and <code>next</code> statements exactly as specified in
   the <a href="#WhileLoop"><code>while</code></a> loop documentation above.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="DoWhileLoop">Do...While Loop</a></h3>
  <p>
   The <code>do...while</code> loop is much like the <code>while</code> loop,
   the only difference being that with the <code>do</code> loop, the body of
   the loop is always executed at least once, and then the condition is
   checked.  The body of the loop then repeats as long as the condition is
   true.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    i=0</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If the body is a single line, the braces can be omitted, but each part of
   the loop has to be on a different line:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    i=0</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can use the <code>next</code> statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a <code>do...while</code> loop.  You can use a labeled
   <code>next</code> statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher
   loop.  See the <a href="#ForLoop">for loop</a> section for an
   example.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can use the <code>break</code> statement to exit the smallest
   containing loop.  You can also use labeled break statements to break out to
   a higher loop.  See the <a href="#WhileLoop">while loop</a> section of the
   documentation for an example.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="DoUntilLoop">Do...Until Loop</a></h3>
  <p>
   The <code>do...until</code> loop is much like the <code>do...while</code>
   loop, the only difference being that the body of the loop repeats until the
   condition becomes true.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    i=0</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If the body is a single line, the braces can be omitted, but each part of
   the loop has to be on a different line:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    i=0</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   You can break out of a <code>do..until</code> loop using <code>break</code>
   and <code>next</code> statements exactly as specified in
   the <code>while</code> loop documentation above.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="ForLoop">For Loop</a></h3>
  <p>
   The above <code>while</code> loop can also be written as:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    for i = 1 to 1000000</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If the body is a single line, the curly braces can be omitted.  The above
   sample can be written as:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    for i = 1 to 1000000</code>
  </p>


  <p>
   The range and step size can be specified using the <code>step</code>
   keyword:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>for i = 1 to 1000 step 3</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The step is <em>required</em> to be specified for any range in which the
   limits are not dimensionless integers.  For example:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>for i = 0 miles to 1 mile step 1 foot</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This also works with a date range, but the step <em>must</em> be specified
   and it must have dimensions of time:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>for time = #2001-01-01# to #2002-01-01# step 1 day</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   A loop can loop over single-character strings.  The loop will normally loop
   upwards, but this can be changed by specifying a negative integer for
   the <code>step</code>.  Each value will be a single-character string.  This
   cannot be used to iterate over undefined Unicode codepoints.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    for c = &#34;a&#34; to &#34;z&#34;</code>
   <code>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    for c = &#34;z&#34; to &#34;a&#34; step -1</code>
   <code>zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The boundaries of a loop may also be boolean values:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>for x = false to true</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Other orderings are allowed such as <code>true to false</code> or
   <code>true to true</code> (the latter only goes through the loop once.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The <code>for</code> loop is also used to iterate over the contents of
   an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> or array.  (You can think of it as a &#34;for each&#34;
   loop, which is really what it is.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = [&#34;zero&#34;, &#34;one&#34;, &#34;two&#34;]</code>
   <code>
    zero</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code>rangeOf[<i>array</i>]</code> function returns an enumeration of
   all the indices in an array.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = [&#34;zero&#34;, &#34;one&#34;, &#34;two&#34;]</code>
   <code>
    index 0 contains zero</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also use the <code>for</code>
   loop to iterate over the contents of Java objects.  See the <a href="#IteratingOverJavaCollections">Iterating over Java Collections</a>
   section of the documentation for more.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> produces a list, and you want to break apart
   that list into named variables in the <code>for</code> loop, write it as:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    for [<i>var1</i>, <i>var2, ...</i>] = <i>enumerating_expression</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Again, if the body is a single line, the curly braces may be
   omitted:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    for [var1, var2] = <i>enum</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   See the <a href="#InputAndOutput">Input and Output</a> section below for a
   sample of its use.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can use the <code>next</code> statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a <code>for</code> loop.  You can use a labeled
   <code>next</code> statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher loop:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    OUTERLOOP:</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The label must precede the loop <em>on a separate line</em> and be followed
   by a colon.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   You can use the <code>break</code> statement to exit the smallest
   containing loop.  You can also use labeled break statements to break out to
   a higher loop.  See the <a href="#WhileLoop">while loop</a> section of the
   documentation for an example.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   (<i>Note to programmers:</i> The special keyword <code>to</code> creates an
   <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> that successively takes on all values from the
   beginning to the end, inclusive, with the default step being 1.  (The step
   size can be changed as shown below.)  You can use this <code>to</code>
   notation anywhere to create an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> that takes on
   successive values.  You can even make it into an array using the
   <code>array</code> function:)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = array[1 to 10]<br/></code>
    <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can create an more flexible <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> that does the same
   as the above by using the format: <code>new range[1, 10]</code> or
   <code>new range[1, 10, 2]</code> formats.  Use this if you&#39;re going to
   assign to variables or use the range symbolically.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="MultiforLoop">Multifor Loop</a></h3>
  <p>
   For programs that require nested <code>for</code> loops for which it&#39;s not
   known in advance how many nested loops will be needed, the
   <code>multifor</code> construct allows multiple loops to be created simply:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    multifor [a, b, c] = [1 to 2, 1 to 3, 1 to 5]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   An similar (and technically better in almost all ways) way of writing
   the loop above would be to create new <code>range</code> objects:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    bounds = [new range[1,2], new range[1,3], new range[1,5]]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   A typical idiom for creating a multi-loop is to use the
   <code>makeArray</code> function to create array bounds.  For example, the
   following creates in effect 8 nested loops, each running from 1 to 2.  The
   results are assigned as an array to the variable <code>d</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    upper = 2</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   As of the 2012-09-04 release, the bounds of one loop can now depend on the
   bounds of the loops to its left, for example:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    multifor [f,g] = [new range[1,3], new range[f+1,3]]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can use the <code>next</code> statement to prematurely jump to the next
   iteration of a <code>multifor</code> loop.  You can use a labeled
   <code>next</code> statement to jump to the next iteration of a higher
   loop.  See the <a href="#ForLoop">for loop</a> section for an
   example.
  </p>

  <p>
   There&#39;s a version of the <code>next</code> statement that jumps to a
   specified level of a <code>multifor</code> loop.  The leftmost/highest
   level is level 0, and the next levels increment to the right.  The loop
   must be labeled and the index to jump to follows the label in the
   <code>next</code> statement.  For example <code>next LOOP i</code> 
  </p>

  <p>
   The program <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=multinexttest.frink">multinexttest.frink</a>
   demonstrates the use of this construct.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="GrayCodes">Gray Codes</a></h3>
  <p>
   A Gray code is a sequence in which only one element of the sequence changes
   at a time.  The best-known Gray code is called the &#34;binary reflected Gray
   code&#34; but a large number of different Gray codes are possible.  You can
   iterate through finite and infinite Gray code sequences using
   the <code>grayCode</code> function.
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code>grayCode</code> functions return an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> that
   returns an array of values.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Finite-length (n, k) Gray Code</b>:  An (n, k) Gray Code is a Gray code
   with <code>n</code> states per element and <code>k</code> elements.  For
   example, the typical binary reflected Gray code is a (2, k) code.  This is
   generated by calling <code>grayCode[<i>n</i>, <i>k</i>]</code>
   where <code>n</code> and <code>k</code> are integers.  For example to
   generate a binary Gray code with 3 digits:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    for c = grayCode[2, 3]</code>
   <code>
    [0, 0, 0]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Finite-length Gray Code with arbitrary states</b>:  You can generate a
   finite-length Gray code where each element can have an arbitrary set of
   states, specified as an array of arrays:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    args = [ [&#34;A&#34;, &#34;B&#34;], [1, 3, 5] ]</code>
   <code>
    [A, 1]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <b>Infinite-length Gray Code</b>:  You can generate a
   infinite-length Gray code where each element has the same number of
   states.  This is different from the other Gray code examples because the
   least-significant element is returned as element 0 in the array, which gets
   longer as more elements are needed.  For example, to generate a binary
   reflected Gray code, use <code>grayCode[2]</code>:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    for c = grayCode[2]</code>
   <code>
    [0]</code>
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="SelfEvaluation">Self-Evaluation</a></h2>
  <p>
   Frink can evaluate a string as a Frink expression.  If that means something
   to you, good.  It&#39;s cool.  You can make programs that write and run their
   own programs.  Frink became self-aware on December 7, 2001 at 9:26 PM MST.
   This is 1561.926 days after Skynet became self-aware.  History will be the
   judge if <em>this</em> December 7th is another date that will live in
   infamy.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>eval[&#34;2 + 2&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   This behavior can also be used to convert a string into a number.  It
   allows users to enter information as any Frink expression such as <code>&#34;6
    billion tons&#34;</code> or <code>2+2</code> and have it handled correctly.
   See the <a href="#Input">Input</a> section below for examples of its use.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>eval[]</code> can also be used to perform another layer of evaluation
   on a value that is not a string.
  </p>

  <p>
   If <code>eval[]</code> is passed an array, all elements of the array will
   be individually evaluated and the result will be returned in an array.
  </p>

  <p>
   There is also a two-argument version, <code>eval[<i>expression</i>,
   <i>rethrows</i>]</code> where the <code>rethrows</code> argument is a
   boolean flag indicating if we want evaluation errors to be thrown or just
   suppressed and <code>undef</code> returned.  If it is true, errors will be
   rethrown as Java exceptions, otherwise an error returns <code>undef</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   There is also a three-argument version, <code>eval[<i>expression</i>,
   <i>rethrows</i>, <i>hidesLocals</i>]</code> where the
   <code>hidesLocal</code> argument is a boolean flag indicating if we want
   to hide local variables before evaluation.
  </p>
  <h3><a name="SecurityRestrictionsOnEval">Security Restrictions on eval[]</a></h3>
  <p>
   The <code>eval[]</code> function restricts some insecure operations from
   being performed (<i>e.g.</i> you can&#39;t read files from the local
   filesystem.)  If you need all functions to be available from your
   evaluation, use the intentionally frighteningly-named
   <code>unsafeEval[<i>str</i>]</code>
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Arrays">Arrays</a></h2>
  <p>
   Arbitrarily-dimensional, non-rectangular, heterogeneous arrays are
   possible.  (If you&#39;re playing &#34;buzzword bingo,&#34; you just won.)  Array
   indices are zero-based.  Arrays are indicated by square brackets.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>c = [1, 2, 3]</code><br/>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can break arrays into multiple lines by inserting newlines after the
   commas:
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>b = [1, 2, 3,</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Think of multidimensional arrays as being a list of lists.  For example,
   to create a 2-dimensional array:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = [[1, 2, 3],</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   To get elements out, use the lovely @ operator (yes, I&#39;m running out of
   bracket types... square brackets would be indistinguishable from function
   calls):
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a@0</code></p>

  <p>
   The method <code><i>array</i>.get[<i>index</i>, <i>altValue</i>]</code>
   can be used to look up the value corresponding to
   the non-negative integer <code>index</code> or return the alternate
   value <code>altValue</code> if the array does not contain that index.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Arrays can be modified in place and automatically extended:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>a@3= &#34;Monkey&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   To get the length of an array, use the <code>length</code> function:</p>

  <p>
   With the advent of array manipulation, I&#39;ve proven to myself that Frink is
   capable of simulating a Turing machine, and thus, as of December 12, 2001,
   at 10:16 PM MST, Frink is theoretically capable of calculating anything
   calculable by any other programming language.
  </p>

  <p>
   To create a new empty array, use the notation:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = new array</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   or use one of the <code>makeArray</code> functions described in the next
   section to create arrays and initialize them.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="InitializingArrays">Initializing Arrays</a></h3>
  <p>
   One-dimensional or multi-dimensional &#34;rectangular&#34; arrays can be
   constructed with the <code>makeArray[<i>dims</i>,
   <i>initialValue</i>]</code> function where <code>dims</code> is an
   <em>array</em> of integers indicating the dimensions of the array, and
   <code>initialValue</code> is the initial value to set in each cell.
   Multi-dimensional arrays are implemented as arrays of arrays.
  </p>

  <p>
   Create a 1-dimensional array with 10 elements, with each element
   initialized to 0:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = makeArray[[10], 0]</code></p>

  <p>
   Create a 2-dimensional array with size 3x4, initialized to 0:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = makeArray[[3,4], 0]</code></p>
  
  <p>
   If called without an initial value, the array is initialized as sparse and
   compact to conserve memory, but you may get errors if reading elements
   you haven&#39;t initialized.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = makeArray[[3,4]]</code></p>

  <p>
   Array elements can still be assigned to, and the appropriate rows will get
   extended to fit them:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a@2@2 = 0</code></p>

  <p>
   <b>Note</b>: <em>All</em> arrays can still be automatically extended by
   assigning to a value outside their currently-defined range.  Creating an
   array with the <code>makeArray</code> methods does <em>not</em> prevent
   arrays from being extended nor prevent them from becoming non-rectangular.
   It is <em>never</em> necessary to pre-allocate a one-dimensional array of a
   specific size, as all arrays will automatically resize on assignment.
  </p>

  <p>
   If <code>initialValue</code> is a function (it can be
   an <a href="#AnonymousFunctions">Anonymous Function</a>), then that
   function is called to provide the value for each cell.  The function must
   have the same number of arguments as the dimensions of the array, and it is
   passed the indices of the cell.  For example, element [0,0] of the array
   will be passed the arguments [0,0].
  </p>

  <p>
   The following makes a cell with each value initialized to twice its index.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>makeArray[[10], {|x| 2x}]</code></p>

  <p>
   A two-dimensional array requires a function with 2 arguments.  The
   following builds a multiplication table:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>makeArray[[5,5], {|a,b| a*b}]</code></p>

  <p>
   If the <code>makeArray</code> function needs additional data, you can use
   the three-argument
   version <code>makeArray[<i>dimensions</i>, <i>function</i>, <i>data</i>]</code>
   which passes an arbitrary <code>data</code> expression to
   <code>function</code> as a last argument.  For example, the following
   creates a &#34;diagonal&#34; matrix with the specified values passed in as an array
   as the diagonal entries:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [1,2,3]</code>
   <code>[[1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 3]]</code>
  </p>
  
  
  <h3><a name="ArrayMethods">Array Methods</a></h3>
  <h4><a name="Copying">Copying</a></h4>
  <p>It is very important to note that arrays are normally passed by
   reference.  This means that if you assign an array to another variable, and
   modify the second variable, then you are modifying the original!
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = [3,2,1]</code></p>

  <p>
   To avoid this behavior, use the method
   <code><i>array</i>.shallowCopy[]</code>.  This makes a shallow copy of the
   object.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>a = [3,2,1]</code></p>
  
  <h4><a name="PushingAndPopping">Pushing and Popping</a></h4>
  <p>
   Arrays can be automatically extended and used as a stack by using the
   methods:
  </p>

   <li><code><i>array</i>.push[<i>x</i>]</code> : Appends an item to the end

   </li><li><code><i>array</i>.pop[]</code> : Removes an item from the end of the
    array (top of stack) and returns it.
    
   </li><li><code><i>array</i>.peek[]</code> : Returns the item from the end of

    the <a href="#Concatenating"><code>concat[<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>]</code></a>
    function if you do not want to modify in-place.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   <code>array = [1, 2]</code></p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [1, 2, 3]</code> now contains <code>[1, 2]</code></p>

  <p>
   Items can also be inserted or popped from the <em>front</em> of an array by
   using the methods <code><i>array</i>.pushFirst[<i>x</i>]</code> and
   <code>a.popFirst[]</code> methods.
  </p>

  <p>
   The contents of one array can be appended to another array using the
   <code><i>array</i>.pushAll[<i>array1</i>]</code> method, which modifies the
   original array in place:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a = [1, 2, 3]</code>
   <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code><br/>

   function if you do not want to modify in-place.
  </p>
  
  <h4><a name="Dimensions">Dimensions</a></h4>
  <p>
   The dimensions of a possibly-multi-dimensional array can be obtained with
   the <code><i>array</i>.dimensions[]</code> method.  The arrays do not have
   to be rectangular; this returns the highest index of any sub-array.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Warning:</b>  This may be a computationally-expensive call because it
   must traverse every element of every sub-array.  Do not use it repeatedly
   in a tight loop on large arrays.
  </p>

  <p>
   For example, the following array has 2 rows and 3 columns so it
   returns <code>[2, 3]</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]</code>
   <code>[2, 3]</code><br/>
  </p>

  <h4><a name="ColumnOperations">Column Operations</a></h4>
  <p>
   You can retrieve and set all of the values in a column of a 2-dimensional
   (or higher) array using the <code>getColumn</code>
   and <code>setColumn</code> functions, and in most cases, with
   the <code>getColumn</code> and <code>setColumn</code> methods of
   the <code>array</code> class.

   Note that there not corresponding <code>getRow</code>
   and <code>setRow</code> operations because rows in a 2-dimensional array
   are already arrays and can be obtained with the <code>@</code>
   array-dereferencing operator.  For example, row 0 of the two-dimensional
   array <code>ary</code> can be obtained and set with <code>ary@0</code>.

   The following example performs a spreadsheet-like operation of summing each
   of the columns of a two-dimensional array and appending the totals of each

  <h4><a name="Concatenating">Concatenating</a></h4>
  <p>
   You can concatenate two arrays (or
   other <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expressions</a>) using
   the 
   <code>concat[<i>array1</i>, <i>array2</i>]</code> function.  (Note that
   this is a <em>function</em>, not a method on arrays!)  This returns a new
   array that is the concatenation of the elements of both arrays.  For now,
   the result is always an array, but this may change
   to be more memory-efficient by letting arbitrary <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expressions</a>
   to follow each other.
  </p>

  <p>
   This does not do any deep copying of the elements.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = [1, 2, 3]</code>
   <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code><br/>
  </p>

  <h4><a name="InsertingAndRemoving">Inserting And Removing</a></h4>
  <p>Items can be inserted into an array using the method
   <code><i>array</i>.insert[<i>index</i>, <i>value</i>]</code>.  This inserts
   the specified value <em>before</em> the item at the specified index.  If the
   index is greater than or equal to the size of the array, the array is
   extended to fit the new elements, setting any unspecified values to the
   undefined value <code>undef</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [0, 1, 2]</code> now contains <code>[first, 0, 1, 2]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Items can be removed from an array using the method
   <code><i>array</i>.remove[<i>index</i>]</code>.  This removes the item with
   the specified index and returns it, so you can do something with the value
   if desired.  If the specified index does not exist, this generates an error.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>array = [&#34;a&#34;, &#34;b&#34;, &#34;c&#34;]</code> now contains <code>[&#34;a&#34;, &#34;c&#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   A range of values can be removed with the
   <code><i>array</i>.remove[<i>start</i>, <i>end</i>]</code> method which
   removes elements starting with index <code>start</code> (inclusive) and
   ending <em>before</em> index <code>end</code> (exclusive.)  The number of
   items that will be removed is <code>start-end</code>.  The return value is
   the number of items that were actually removed.  (The end index is allowed
   to run off the end of the array.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> now contains <code>[0, 1, 4, 5]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Similarly, a range of values can be removed with the
   <code><i>array</i>.removeLen[<i>start</i>, <i>length</i>]</code> method
   which removes elements starting with index <code>start</code> (inclusive)
   and removes <code>length</code> number of items.  The return value is the
   number of items that were actually removed (the length may run off the end
   of the array.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> now contains <code>[0, 1, 4, 5]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Items with a specified <em>value</em> can be removed from an array using
   the method <code><i>array</i>.removeValue[<i>value</i>]</code>.  This
   removes the first item having the specified <em>value</em> from the array.
   If a matching item is found, this returns <code>true</code>, otherwise
   returns <code>false</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [&#34;one&#34;, &#34;two&#34;, &#34;three&#34;]</code> now contains <code>[&#34;one&#34;, &#34;three&#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code><i>array</i>.removeAll[<i>value</i>]</code> method removes
   <em>all</em> elements in the array which have the specified value.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>array = [1,2,3,1]</code>
   <code>[2, 3]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   A random item can be removed from an array using the method
   <code><i>array</i>.removeRandom[]</code>.  This removes a random item and
   returns its value.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [&#34;a&#34;, &#34;b&#34;, &#34;c&#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <h4><a name="SearchingArrays">Searching Arrays</a></h4>
  <p>
   You can test if an item is contained in an array with the
   <code><i>array</i>.contains[<i>value</i>]</code> method:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>array = [1,2,3,1]</code>
   <code>true</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   You can find the first indexes of items in an array with the methods:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    <i>array</i>.indexOf[<i>value</i>]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If the item does not exist, these return <code>-1</code>.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="Permutations">Permutations</a></h4>
  <p>
   You can obtain all of the permutations of the array by using the
   <code>permute[]</code> method.  This returns an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> that
   lazily generates the permutations.  Note that the permutations are
   currently in reflected Gray code order, but this may change.
  </p>

  <p>
   The number of items returned will
   be <code>permutationCount[<i>m,m</i>]</code> (which equals <code>m!</code>
   in this case where all items are taken) where <code>m</code> is the length
   of the array.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [1, 2, 3]</code>
   <code>[[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1], [2, 1, 3]]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   If you need the results in lexicographical order, with duplicates removed,
   you can obtain all of the permutations of the array by using the
   <code>lexicographicPermute</code> method.
   This returns an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> that lazily generates the
   permutations.  Note that all of the elements of the array <em>must be
    comparable to each other</em>, a constraint which is not necessary in the
   <code>permute</code> method.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [1, 2, 3]</code>
   <code>[[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also specify an ordering function to be used by the
   <code>lexicographicPermute</code> method.  The function should take two
   arguments and return -1, 0, or 1 to indicate if item <code>a</code> is less
   than, equal to, or greater than item <code>b</code> respectively.  The
   following example sorts by length.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [&#34;aa&#34;, &#34;bbb&#34;, &#34;c&#34;]</code>
   <code>
    [[c, aa, bbb], [c, bbb, aa], [aa, c, bbb], [aa, bbb, c], [bbb, c, aa], [bbb, aa, c]]
    </code>
  </p>
  
  <h4><a name="Combinations">Combinations</a></h4>
  <p>
   You can obtain all of the combinations of the array by using the
   <code>combinations[<i>take</i>]</code> method.  This returns an enumerating
   expression that lazily generates combinations.  Note that the combinations
   are currently in lexicographical order, (without duplicates removed,) but
   this may change.  For example, to take 3 items at a time from a list:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [1, 2, 3, 4]</code>
   <code>[[1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4]]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The number of combinations that will be generated
   is <code>binomial[num,take]</code> where <code>num</code> is the number of
   items in the array and <code>take</code> is the number of items to take at
   a time.
  </p>

  <p>
   The sample program <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=pokerhands.frink">pokerhands.frink</a>
   demonstrates using this method to enumerate all possible 5-card poker hands.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="SlicingArrays">Slicing Arrays</a></h4>
  <p>
   You can take the first items from an array (or any <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a>)
   using the <code>first[<i>expr</i>, <i>num</i>]</code> function.  This
   returns an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> that returns the first <code>num</code>
   items and discards the rest.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = new range[1, 10]</code>
   <code>
    [1, 2, 3, 4]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The opposite of <code>first[<i>expr</i>, <i>num</i>]</code>
   is <code>rest[<i>expr</i>, <i>num</i>]</code>.  This returns
   everything <em>after</em> the first <code>num</code> elements in the list.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a = new range[1, 10]</code>
   <code>
    [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If you only want the first element as as single expression, you can
   use <code>first[<i>expr</i>]</code> .  This is like the
   ridiculously-named <code>car</code> function in other languages (whose name
   is a badly-chosen name from a 1950s-era computer.  <em>Please stop using the
   names <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> in modern languages.</em>)
  </p>

  <p>
   The opposite of <code>first[<i>expr</i>]</code>
   is <code>rest[<i>expr</i>]</code>.  This returns everything <em>after</em>
   the first element in the list.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = [1, 2, 3]</code>
   <code>
    1
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can take the last items from an array (or any <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a>)
   using the <code>last[<i>expr</i>, <i>num</i>]</code> function.  This
   returns an array that returns the last <code>num</code> items and discards
   the rest.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a = new range[1, 10]</code>
   <code>
    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
   </code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   If you only want the last element as as single expression, you can
   use <code>last[<i>expr</i>]</code> .
  </p>
  
  <p>
   You can get an arbitrary &#34;slice&#34; out of an array using
   the <code>slice</code> and
   <code>sliceLength</code> functions.  (Note that these are functions, not
   methods.)
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code>slice[<i>array</i>, <i>start</i>, <i>end</i>]</code> function
   returns a slice of an array starting with index <code>start</code> and
   ending <em>before</em> index <code>end</code>.  If the indices are beyond
   the ends of the array, only existing items will be returned.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]</code>
   <code>[1,2]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If <code>start</code> or <code>end</code> are the special value
   <code>undef</code>, then the slice will contain the start of the array
   or the end of the array respectively.
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code>sliceLength[<i>array</i>, <i>start</i>, <i>length</i>]</code>
   function returns a slice of an array starting with index <code>start</code>
   and containing <code>length</code> items.  If the indices are beyond the
   end of the array, only existing items will be returned.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]</code>
   <code>[1,2,3]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The inverse of <code>slice</code> and <code>sliceLength</code> are the
   functions <code>removeSlice</code> and <code>removeSliceLength</code> which
   <em>remove</em> the parts specified by the <code>slice</code> commands and
   return the rest.
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code>removeSlice[<i>array</i>, <i>start</i>, <i>end</i>]</code>
   function removes array elements starting with index <code>start</code>
   and ending <em>before</em> index <code>end</code>.  If the indices are
   beyond the ends of the array, only existing items will be removed.
   (Note that this is the inverse of what is returned by <code>slice</code>
   with the same arguments.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
   If <code>start</code> or <code>end</code> are the special value
   <code>undef</code>, then the function will remove from the beginning of the
   array or to the end of the array respectively.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]</code>
   <code>[0, 3, 4]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The <code>removeSliceLength[<i>array</i>, <i>start</i>,
    <i>length</i>]</code> function removes a slice of an array starting with
   index <code>start</code> and containing <code>length</code> items.  If the
   indices are beyond the end of the array, only existing items will be
   removed.  (Note that this is the inverse of what is returned by
   <code>sliceLength</code> with the same arguments.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]</code>
   <code>[0,4]</code>
  </p>

  <h4><a name="Flattening">Flattening</a></h4>
  <p>
   A list of lists can be flattened with the <code>flatten[<i>list</i>]</code>
   function:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = [ [1,2], 3, [4, [5,6]] ]</code>
   <code>
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   </code>
  </p>

  <h4><a name="Subsets">Subsets</a></h4>
  <p>
   To obtain all of the possible subsets of the elements in the array (this is
   also called the &#34;power set&#34;,) you can use
   the <code><i>array</i>.subsets[]</code> method.  This returns an
   <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> which iterates through all the subsets of items in
   the array, including the empty set and the original set itself.  Each
   return value is itself an array of elements, with the elements preserving
   the same order as in the original array:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = [1,2,3]</code>
   <code>
    [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also request the subsets of the array and exclude either the empty
   set or the original set by using the
   <code><i>array</i>.subsets[<i>allowEmptySet</i>, <i>allowOriginalSet</i>]</code>
   method.  If <code>allowEmptySet</code> is <code>true</code>, the empty set
   will be returned as one of the elements.  If <code>false</code>, the empty
   set will be excluded. If <code>allowOriginalSet</code> is
   <code>true</code>, the full original set will be returned as one of the
   elements.  If <code>false</code>, the full original set will be excluded,
   and only &#34;proper&#34; subsets will be returned.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a = [1,2,3]</code>
   <code>
    [[1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that output of the empty set and the original set are suppressed in
   the example above.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="Shuffling">Shuffling</a></h4>
  <p>
   The contents of an array can be shuffled randomly with the
   <code><i>array</i>.shuffle[]</code> method (using the Fisher-Yates-Knuth
   algorithm):
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = [1,2,3]</code>
   <code>
    [3, 1, 2]
   </code>
  </p>

  <h4><a name="Clearing">Clearing</a></h4>
  <p>
   The contents of an array can be cleared with the
   <code><i>array</i>.clear[]</code> method:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = [1,2,3]</code>
   <code>
    []
   </code>
  </p>

  <h4><a name="Transpose">Transpose</a></h4>
  <p>
   While Frink does not have a complete implementation of matrix operations,
   (for an external class with some matrix operations, see <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=Matrix.frink">Matrix.frink</a>, and please
   contribute algorithms to that file,) it has some built-in methods that
   support matrix calculations.
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code><i>array</i>.transpose[]</code> method transposes the
    elements of a 2-dimensional array, like in matrix calculations.  This
    means that rows and columns are switched.  In other words, the element at
    <code><i>array</i>@i@j</code> becomes the element at
    <code><i>array</i>@j@i</code>.
  </p>

  <p>

   the <a href="#EnumeratingExpressionFunctions">enumerating expression
   functions</a> such as <code>first</code>, <code>last</code>, etc. will work
   on arrays.  Note that they are <em>functions</em> that work on a
   variety of data types, and not methods on the array.  That is, you call
   them as <code>first[<i>array</i>]</code> and
   <em>not</em> <code><i>array</i>.first[]</code>.  See the following section
   for more information.
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="EnumeratingExpressions">Enumerating Expressions</a></h2>
  <p>
   Some functions can return a lazily-produced list of results.  These may be
   finite or infinite, and you often don&#39;t know in advance how long they will
   be, so the <code>length</code> function does not work on them.  Frink calls
   these &#34;Enumerating Expressions&#34;.  For example, the
   function <code>primes[]</code> returns an infinite list of prime numbers.
   Other enumerating expressions may be finite, such as the
   commonly-seen <code>1 to 10</code> notation, usually used in
   a <code>for</code> loop, which sequentially returns the integers from 1 to
   10.
  </p>

  <p>
   You usually don&#39;t want to print out all of the values of an enumerating
   expression directly (because they may be infinite), but rather use it in
   a <code>for</code> loop and handle each value individually.  After a value
   is returned from an enumerating expression, it is &#34;forgotten&#34;, which helps
   reduce memory usage.
  </p>

  <p>
   It is important to note that many or most enumerating expressions are
   &#34;use-once&#34;; the values produced by the expression are only produced once.
   Even printing the values in Frink&#39;s interactive mode causes the values to
   be consumed.  If you need the values multiple times, it is beneficial to
   wrap them in something like a <code>toArray[<i>expr</i>]</code> call.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can test if an expression is an enumerating expression with
   the <code>isEnumerating[<i>expr</i>]</code> function.  Note that many of
   Frink&#39;s data types are also enumerating expressions,
   including <code>array</code>, <code>dict</code>,
   <code>set</code>, <code><a href="#OrderedList">OrderedList</a></code>, <code>RingBuffer</code>, etc.,
   and will return <code>true</code> to this query.

  <h3><a name="EnumeratingExpressionFunctions">Enumerating Expression Functions</a></h3>
  <p>
   This is a partial list of functions that have special behavior that makes
   them useful for working with (possibly infinite) enumerating expression.
   Note that arrays are enumerating expressions, so all of these will work
   with arrays.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><code>first[<i>expr</i>]</code> returns the first element of an array
    or enumerating expression as a single expression.

   </li><li><code>first[<i>expr</i>, <i>count</i>]</code> returns the
    first <code>count</code> elements of an array or enumerating expression.
    If the expression passed in is an array, the result is an array,
    otherwise it is a (possibly-infinite) enumerating expression.

   </li><li><code>rest[<i>expr</i>]</code> returns everything <em>after</em> the
    first element of an array or enumerating expression.  If the expression
    passed in is an array, the result is an array, otherwise it is a
    (possibly-infinite) enumerating expression.  This is the opposite of
    <code>first[<i>expr</i>]</code>
    
   </li><li><code>rest[<i>expr</i>, <i>num</i>]</code> returns
    everything <em>after</em> the first <code>num</code> elements of an array
    or enumerating expression.  If the expression passed in is an array, the
    result is an array, otherwise it is a (possibly-infinite) enumerating
    expression.  This is the opposite of <code>first[<i>expr</i>, <i>num</i>]</code>
    
   </li><li><code>last[<i>expr</i>]</code> returns the last element of an array
    or enumerating expression as a single expression.

   </li><li><code>last[<i>expr</i>, <i>count</i>]</code> returns the
    last <code>count</code> elements of an array or enumerating expression.
    The result is an array.

   </li><li><code>slice[<i>expr</i>, <i>begin</i>, <i>end</i>]</code> returns a
    slice of an array or enumerating expression starting with
    index <code>start</code> and ending <em>before</em>
    index <code>end</code>.  If the indices are beyond the ends of the
    array, only existing items will be returned.  If <code>begin</code>
    or <code>end</code> is the value <code>undef</code>, the results will
    include the beginning or end of the expression respectively.  If the
    expression passed in is an array, the result is an array, otherwise it
    is a (possibly-infinite) enumerating expression.

   </li><li><code>sliceLength[<i>expr</i>, <i>begin</i>, <i>length</i>]</code>
    returns a slice of an array or enumerating expression starting with
    index <code>start</code> and having <code>length</code> items.  If the
    expression passed in is an array, the result is an array, otherwise it
    is an enumerating expression.

   </li><li><code>chunks[<i>expr</i>, <i>size</i>]</code> returns an enumerating
    expression which breaks <code>expr</code> into a series of chunks of
    length <code>size</code>, where each chunk is an array.

    <p>
     For example, </p>
    
   </li><li><code>chunks[<i>expr</i>, <i>size</i>, <i>step</i>]</code> returns an
    enumerating expression which breaks <code>expr</code> into a series of
    chunks of length <code>size</code>, advancing by <code>step</code>
    elements at each step, where each chunk is an array.
    
    <p>
     For example, </p>
    
   </li><li><code>nth0[<i>expr</i>, <i>index</i>]</code> returns the specified
    element of an array or enumerating expression, treating the first element
    as element 0.  This replaces the function called <code>nth</code> (which
    is still available but deprecated.)

   </li><li><code>nth1[<i>expr</i>, <i>index</i>]</code> returns the specified
    element of an array or enumerating expression, treating the first element
    as element 1.  For example, to return the millionth
    prime:  <code>nth[primes[], million]</code>
    
   </li><li><code>toArray[<i>expr</i>]</code> turns a finite enumerating expression
    into an array.

   </li><li><code>countToArray[<i>expr</i>]</code> counts the number of times that
    each unique expression occurs in an enumeration and returns the count as a
    sorted array of <code>[<i>element</i>, <i>count</i>]</code> pairs with the most
    common items first.  This can be used to count letter frequencies
    (with <code>charList</code>,) word frequencies
    (with <code>wordList</code>,) occurrences of repeated lines in 
    a file (with <code>lines</code>,) etc.  See also
    the <code>countToDict</code> function below.

    <p>
     For example, counting the array </p>
    
   </li><li><code>countToDict[<i>expr</i>]</code> counts the number of times that
    each unique expression occurs in an enumeration and returns the count as a
    dictionary where the key is the element and the value is the count.  See
    also the <code>countToArray</code> function above.

    <p>
     For example, counting the array</p>

   </li><li><code>mostCommon[<i>expr</i>]</code> counts the number of times that
    each unique expression occurs in an enumeration and returns only the
    item(s) that occur the most commonly.  This returns <code>[vals,
    count]</code> where <code>vals</code> is an array of only the items which
    occur the most often and <code>count</code> is the number of their count.
    For more general counting, see the <code>countToArray</code>
    and <code>countToDict</code> functions above.

    <p>
     For example, </p>

    <p>
     This can be used to find the <i>mode</i> of a distribution (that is,
     similar to mean and median, the statistical definition of the <i>mode</i>
     is the value(s) that occur the most times in a distribution.)
    </p>

    <p>
     <code>modes[nums] := mostCommon[nums]@0</code>
     <code>[1, 4]</code>
    </p>

   </li><li><code>leastCommon[<i>expr</i>]</code> counts the number of times that
    each unique expression occurs in an enumeration and returns only the
    item(s) that occur the least commonly.  This returns <code>[vals,
    count]</code> where <code>vals</code> is an array of only the items which
    occur the least often and <code>count</code> is the number of their count.
    For more general counting, see the <code>countToArray</code>
    and <code>countToDict</code> functions above.

    <p>
     For example, </p>

    <p>
     <code>a =  [1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 5]</code>
     <code>
      2 occurs 1 times</code>
    </p>
     
   </li><li><code>count[<i>start</i>]</code> creates an
    infinte <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> that
    counts up from the specified number, incrementing by 1 each time.  Note
    that this will produce infinite output if you even try to print it, so you
    probably want to call it from a <code>for</code> loop (perhaps with
    a <code>break</code> statement) or from something
    like <code>first[count[1], 100]</code>

   </li><li><code>count[<i>start</i>, <i>step</i>]</code> creates an
    infinte <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> that
    counts from the specified number, adding <code>step</code> (which
    can be negative) each time.  Note
    that this will produce infinite output if you even try to print it, so you
    probably want to call it from a <code>for</code> loop (perhaps with
    a <code>break</code> statement) or from something
    like <code>first[count[2, 2], 100]</code>
    
   </li><li><code>allSame[<i>expr</i>]</code> returns <code>true</code> if all of
    the items in an EnumeratingExpression are all the same.  This
    returns <code>true</code> for an empty list.  If the argument is not an
    enumerating expression, this returns <code>true</code>.
    
   </li><li><code>allDifferent[<i>expr</i>]</code> Returns <code>true</code> if all
    of the items in an EnumeratingExpression are all different.  All items in
    the list must be HashingExpressions.  This returns <code>true</code> for
    an empty list.  If the argument is not an enumerating expression, this
    returns <code>true</code>.

   </li><li><code>allEqual[<i>list</i>, <i>target</i>]</code>
    Returns <code>true</code> if all of the items in the EnumeratingExpression
    <code>list</code> are equal to <code>target</code>. This
    returns <code>true</code> for an empty list.  If the argument is not an
    enumerating expression, this returns <code>true</code>.
  </li></ul>
  
  <h2><a name="OrderedList">OrderedList</a></h2>
  <p>
   An <code>OrderedList</code> is an array that is always kept in order.  Of
   course, this implies that all items in an <code>OrderedList</code> must be
   comparable with each other.  It extends the <code>array</code> class and
   almost all methods and functions that operate on <code>array</code> will
   work with <code>OrderedList</code>, unless those methods would violate the
   ordering (e.g. <code>pushFirst</code>).
  </p>

  <p>
   By default, the ordering is the default ordering produced by the
   <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> <a href="#ThreeWayComparison">three-way
   comparison</a> operator.  If another user-defined ordering is desired, it
   can be specified by one of the constructors explained in the next section.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="InitializingOrderedList">Initializing OrderedList</a></h3>
  <p>
   An <code>OrderedList</code> with the default ordering (that is, identical
   to the <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> <a href="#ThreeWayComparison">three-way
   comparison</a> operator) can be created by
   calling <code>new OrderedList</code>:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = new OrderedList
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If you want to specify a user-defined ordering, you can pass a (possibly <a href="#AnonymousFunctions">anonymous</a>) function as the first argument to
   the constructor.  This function must take two arguments (we&#39;ll call them)
   <code>[a,b]</code>, and return -1 if <code>a&lt;b</code>, 0 if
   <code>a==b</code>, and 1 if <code>a&gt;b</code>.  (These are the values
   returned by
   the <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> <a href="#ThreeWayComparison">three-way
   comparison</a> operator, so you may be able to use it in your comparison
   function.)
  </p>

  <p>
   For example, if you want to use an ordering that simply sorts shorter
   strings before longer strings, (say that six times speedily,) you can do the
   following:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    </code>
   <code>
    [z, aa, bbb] 
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   An OrderedList can also take a piece of arbitrary data that is passed to
   the comparison function.  This data is passed as the second argument to the
   constructor.  If the first argument to the constructor is
   <code>undef</code>, the default orderer will be used.  The data will be
   passed as a third argument to the comparison function.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    </code>
   <code>
    [3, 4, 1, -2] 
   </code>
  </p>

  <h3><a name="OrderedListMethods">OrderedList Methods</a></h3>
  <p>
   Since <code>OrderedList</code> extends <code>array</code>, <a href="#ArrayMethods">array methods</a> are available on OrderedList unless
   they would interfere with preserving ordering.  New methods and methods
   with altered effects are listed below.
  </p>

  <table summary="OrderedList Methods">
    <tbody><tr><th>Method</th><th>Definition
      
    </th></tr><tr><td>binarySearch[<i>expr</i>]</td><td>Returns the index of the
      item to insert <em>before</em> to put the item in the right order.  If
      the item is found anywhere in the list, this returns the index of the
      matching item in the list.  If the item is not found in the list, this
      still returns the index before which it should be inserted.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>contains[<i>value</i>]</td><td>Returns true if the list
      contains 1 or more instances of the specified value, false if it does
      not.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>indexOf[<i>expr</i>]</td><td>Returns the index of one of
      the occurrences of the specified value in the list, <code>undef</code>
      if it does not occur.  If multiple instances of the same value occur in
      the list, this may return the index of any of the instances.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>insert[<i>value</i>]</td><td>Inserts the specified value
      into the appropriate place in the list.  If it&#39;s already there, this
      inserts a duplicate before the existing element.  (See the
      <code>insertUnique</code> method if you don&#39;t want duplicates.) Returns
      the index where the item was inserted, but this behavior may change.

    </td></tr><tr><td>insertUnique[<i>value</i>]</td><td>Inserts the specified
      value into the appropriate place in the list.  If it&#39;s already there, a
      new value is not added.  Returns the index where the item was inserted,
      but this behavior may change.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>insert[<i>pos</i>, <i>value</i>]</td><td><b>Disallowed</b>

    </td></tr><tr><td>shuffle[]</td><td>This differs from the behavior of
      <code><i>array</i>.shuffle[]</code> in that it does not modify the
      structure in place, but rather returns a new (unordered)
      <code>array</code> which is shuffled randomly.
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  <h2><a name="RingBuffer">RingBuffer</a></h2>
  <p>
   A <code>RingBuffer</code> is a type of array, but with a fixed maximum
   size.  It is efficient to append items to the end of the list using the
   <code>push[<i>item</i>]</code> method, and to remove them from the beginning
   using the <code>popFirst[<i>item</i>]</code>, which is how it will usually
   be used.  If more items are pushed than the fixed capacity allows, the item
   at the front of the buffer is discarded.
  </p>

  <p>
   Items can also be accessed randomly using the array index <code>@</code>
   operator.  The first item is always element 0.  When an item is popped from
   the beginning of the list using the <code>popFirst[]</code> method, the
   item that was previously at index 1 becomes index 0, and so on.  If you
   attempt to access an item that does not exist, this raises an error, but
   this behavior may change.
  </p>

  <p>
   A <code>RingBuffer</code> is constructed by specifying its size as a
   positive integer:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>rb = new RingBuffer[10]</code><br/>
  </p>

  <p>
   Like other Frink collections, you can find out how many items are contained
   with the <code>length[<i>expr</i>]</code> function.  You can also turn it
   into a traditional array with the <code>toArray[<i>ringBuffer</i>]</code>
   function.  Its elements can be enumerated with a <code>for</code> loop.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following demonstrates using a RingBuffer to capture the last
   <code>n</code> elements of an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> (this could be a list,
   or the lines of a file from the <code>lines</code> function, etc.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    last[expr, n]:=</code>
  </p>

  <h3><a name="RingBufferMethods">RingBuffer Methods</a></h3>
  <p>
   The following methods operate on <code>RingBuffer</code>.  They are mostly
   the same as the corresponding <a href="#ArrayMethods">array methods</a>,
   with differences as noted below:
  </p>
  <table summary="RingBuffer Methods">
    <tbody><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description
    </th></tr><tr><td>push[<i>expr</i>]</td><td>Pushes the specified expression
      onto the end of the list.  If the <code>RingBuffer</code> is at
      capacity, this will throw away the item at the beginning and change the
      indices of the array.  The first element is always element 0 of the list.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>pushFirst[<i>expr</i>]</td><td>Pushes the specified
      expression to the beginning of the list.  If the <code>RingBuffer</code>
      is at capacity, this will throw away the item at the end.  The new
      element becomes element 0 of the list.

    </td></tr><tr><td>pop[]</td><td>Removes the last element from the list and
      returns its value.  If the list is empty, this currently throws an error
      but this behavior may change.

    </td></tr><tr><td>popFirst[]</td><td>Removes the first element from the list
      and returns its value.  This will change the indices for the remaining
      items.   If the list is empty, this currently throws an error
      but this behavior may change.

    </td></tr><tr><td>pushAll[<i>collection</i>]</td><td>Pushes all the elements
      in the specified collection (which can be an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a>,)
      individually, onto the end of the list.  If the collection is an array
      with known length, this is done efficiently.

    </td></tr><tr><td>isEmpty[]</td><td>Returns true if the
      <code>RingBuffer</code> is empty, false otherwise.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>isFull[]</td><td>Returns true if the
      <code>RingBuffer</code> is full, false otherwise.

    </td></tr><tr><td>contains[<i>expr</i>]</td><td>Returns true if the given

    </td></tr><tr><td>indexOf[<i>expr</i>]</td><td>Returns the index of the first
      occurrence of the specified expression in the list, <code>-1</code> if
      it does not exist in the list.

    </td></tr><tr><td>indexOf[<i>expr</i>, <i>startIndex</i>]</td><td>Returns the
      index of the first occurrence of the specified expression in the list,
      beginning the search at index <code>startIndex</code>.  This returns
      <code>-1</code> if it does not exist at that point or later in the list.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>lastIndexOf[<i>expr</i>]</td><td>Returns the index of the

  </td></tr></tbody></table>
  
  <h2><a name="Input">Input</a></h2>
  <p>
   You can request input from the user with the
   <code>input[<i>prompt</i>]</code> or
   <code>input[<i>prompt</i>, <i>defaultValue</i>]</code> function.
   The result always comes back as a string, but you can parse it into a unit,
   a date, or whatever, using the <code>eval[str]</code> function:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>radius = input[&#34;Enter the radius of a sphere: &#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   This allows your users to enter things like &#34;3 inches&#34; or &#34;1 mile&#34; or any
   units that Frink knows about (like &#34;earthradius&#34;,) and everything will Just
   Work.  (That &#34;Self-Evaluation&#34; section above seemed irrelevant at the time,
   but it turns out it&#39;s quite useful.)
  </p>

  <p>
   If the user cancels the input dialog, or, for text input, if end-of-file is
   reached, this returns the special value <code>undef</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   In command-line mode, these <code>input</code> functions also allow you to
   read from standard input (stdin).  (User input is actually taken from stdin
   in command-line mode, as you may expect.)  Lines can be read one at a time,
   <em>and have trailing carriage returns/linefeeds removed.</em>  On
   end-of-file (EOF), the input function returns the special value
   <code>undef</code>.  A short-program to read from standard in and echo its
   output may look like:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>while (line = input[&#34;&#34;]) != undef</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If, for some reason, you&#39;re in a GUI mode and you still want to read from
   standard input, you can call <code>readStdin[]</code> to read one line
   from standard input.  This is just like calling <code>input[&#34;&#34;]</code> from
   command-line mode, which is what you really want to be calling if you&#39;re
   trying to make programs that work both interactively and non-interactively,
   and in GUI mode and non-GUI mode.  But if you&#39;re sure you only ever want to
   read from standard input, and don&#39;t want to trigger a GUI input window, use
   <code>readStdin[]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>while (line = readStdin[]) != undef</code>
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="MultiInput">Multi-Input</a></h3>
  <p>
   If you want to request multiple input items from the user, you can use the
   &#34;multi-input&#34; version of the input function, where the second argument is an
   array of items you&#39;re going to prompt for:
  </p><p>
   <code>[first, last] = input[&#34;What is your name&#34;, [&#34;First Name&#34;, &#34;Last Name&#34;]]</code><br/>
  </p>

  <p>
   This will produce a graphical user interface which prompts the user for
   their input.  This works on AWT, Swing, Android, and in text mode if you&#39;re
   running in a pure text environment.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The results will be returned as an array of strings, in the same order as
   they were specified.  As in the <a href="#Input">Input</a> section above,
   you can use the <code>eval[<i>str</i>]</code> function to parse them into
   numeric or other values.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the user cancels the input dialog, or, for text input, if end-of-file is
   reached, this returns the special value <code>undef</code> instead of an
   array.  When in text mode, if end-of-file is reached before filling the
   second or later item, then partial results will be returned (with the
   special value <code>undef</code> being returned for each incomplete value.)
  </p>

  <p>
   If any of the items in the array is a two-element array, the second
   argument will be used as the default value:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>[first, last] = input[&#34;What is your name&#34;,[[&#34;First
    Name&#34;, &#34;Jeff&#34;], [&#34;Last Name&#34;, &#34;Albertson&#34;]]]</code>

  <p>
   The following program demonstrates an idiom for creating a simple
   interactive GUI that finds roots of numbers until you cancel.  The
   <code>while</code> loop exits when the user cancels calculations.  Previous
   results are displayed to the user at the top of the input dialog, and the
   user&#39;s previous input is maintained (verbatim) in the input fields.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    n = &#34;10000&#34;</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This code works whether the user is running with a Swing or AWT or Android
   GUI, or in text mode.  The user cancels input by closing the input dialog
   (in Swing or AWT), hitting the &#34;back&#34; button on Android, or with
   end-of-file (EOF) in text mode (EOF can be simulated by Control-D on
   Unixlike systems, Control-Z on Windows.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that the idiomatic use of the &#34;eval&#34; function to turn the string
   inputs into Frink expressions.  This means that the user can enter any
   expression that Frink understands, such as &#34;<code>2+2</code>&#34;, &#34;<code>1
    trillion</code>&#34;, &#34;<code>sin[30 degrees]</code>&#34; or &#34;<code>32
    m^2</code>&#34;.  It&#39;s like a generalized calculator inside of a specialized
   calculator!

  <h2><a name="Output">Output</a></h2>
  <p>
   To print, use the <code>print</code> or <code>println</code> functions,
   each of which take one argument.  The only difference is that
   <code>println</code> sends a linefeed afterwards.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>println[&#34;The volume of the sphere is &#34; + (volume -&gt;

  <h2><a name="BooleanOperators">Boolean Operators</a></h2>
  <p>
   I&#39;m just going to list a forest of cryptic boolean expressions here without
   explanation.  You pick out the ones you like.  They all work, and there are
   usually multiple equivalents for the same thing, taken from different
   languages.  I&#39;ve tried to keep precedence the same as Java.  There is no
   difference between the different versions of, say,
   <code>and</code>, <code>AND</code>,
   and <code>&amp;&amp;</code> .
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    true TRUE false FALSE == != &lt;&gt; &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;= &amp;&amp; and
    AND || or OR ! NOT not nand NAND nor NOR xor XOR implies IMPLIES
   </code>
  </p>

  <h2><a name="ThreeWayComparison">Three-Way Comparison</a></h2>
  <p>
   The three-way comparison operator, <code>&lt;=&gt;</code>, also called the
   &#34;spaceship&#34; operator, compares two arguments and returns their relative
   ordering:
  </p>

  <p>
   For <code>a &lt;=&gt; b</code>, this returns:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><code>-1</code> if <code>a &lt; b</code>
   </li><li><code> 0</code> if <code>a == b</code>
   </li><li><code> 1</code> if <code>a &gt; b</code>
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   These are the values expected by ordering functions, such as those used in
   user-defined <a href="#Sorting">sorting</a>.

  <h2><a name="Dictionaries">Dictionaries</a></h2>
  <p>
   A dictionary is an associative data structure that lets you map arbitrary
   keys to values (currently, keys can be strings, units, (that is, numbers),
   <a href="#Sets">sets</a>, other dictionaries, arrays, date/time values, or
   objects created from a <code>class</code>.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The syntax is identical to the syntax for array element manipulation.  (This
   means that you can switch back and forth between an array and (sparse)
   dictionary representation for integer-indexed data structures!)
  </p>

  <p>
   Create an empty dictionary using <code>new dict</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = new dict</code>  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    b = new dict</code>  </p>

  <p>
   You can also enumerate over <code>[key, value]</code> pairs directly in a
   dictionary.  They are not returned in any guaranteed order.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>for [key, value] = a</code></p>
  
  <h3><a name="DictionaryConstructors">Dictionary Constructors</a></h3>
  <p>
   Create an empty dictionary:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = new dict</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Create a dictionary from an array (or <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a>) where each
   element in the array is a two-item list which are treated as a key and a
   value:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [[&#34;one&#34;, 1], [&#34;two&#34;, 2]]  </code>
   <code>1</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   You can also turn an array (or other types) into a dictionary by calling
   the <code>toDict[<i>array</i>]</code> function on it, which behaves exactly
   like calling the single-argument constructor above.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   Create a dictionary from two arrays (or <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expressions</a>) where the
   first array contains keys and the second array contains values.  The first
   element in the keys array will be matched with the first element in the
   values array.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    keys = [&#34;one&#34;, &#34;two&#34;]</code>
   <code>1</code></p>

  
  <h3><a name="DictionaryMethods">Dictionary Methods</a></h3>
  <p>
   You can get an enumeration of the keys in a dictionary by using the
   <code>keys</code> method.  This method does not return the keys in any
   defined order, but you can sort them with the <a href="#Sorting">sorting
    functions</a> below.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>for key = a.keys[]</code></p>

  <p>
   The following enumerates through key, value pairs sorted by key.  This
   works because the <code>sort</code> function works by coercing
   an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> (of
   which <code>dict</code> is one) into an array
   of <code>[<i>key</i>, <i>value</i>]</code> pairs and sorting by column 0
   which is the key:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>for [key, val] = sort[a, byColumn[0]]</code></p>
  
  <p>
   You can get an enumeration of the values in a dictionary by using the
   <code>values</code> method.  This method does not return the keys in any
   defined order, but you can sort them with the <a href="#Sorting">sorting
    functions</a> below.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>println[join[&#34;, &#34;, a.values[]]</code></p>

  <p>
   The following enumerates through key, value pairs sorted by key.  This
   works because the <code>sort</code> function works by coercing
   an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> (of
   which <code>dict</code> is one) into an array
   of <code>[<i>key</i>, <i>value</i>]</code> pairs and sorting by column 1
   which is the key:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>for [key, val] = sort[a, byColumn[1]]</code></p>
  
  <p>
   The syntax <code><i>dict</i>@<i>key</i></code> looks up the value of an
   dictionary corresponding to a specific key and returns it
   or the special value <code>undef</code> if the dictionary does not contain
   that key.  The method <code><i>dict</i>.get[<i>key</i>,
   altValue=undef]</code> can be used to look up the value corresponding to
   the key or return the alternate value <code>altValue</code> if the
   dictionary does not contain that key.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a.get[4]</code></p>
  
  <p>
   A dictionary can be queried to see if it contains a specific key using the
   <code>containsKey[<i>key</i>]</code> method:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>b.containsKey[1]</code></p>

  <p>
   Entries in a dictionary can be removed with the
   <code>remove[<i>key</i>]</code> method.  This returns the value
   corresponding to the key, or the special value <code>undef</code> if that
   key is not in the dictionary.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>b.remove[1]</code></p>

  <p>
   You can invert the contents of a dictionary by using the
   <code>invert</code> method which returns a new dictionary with key-value
   pairs reversed.  If the values are not hashable, this will print a
   warning.  If the same value appears multiple times, this will print a
   warning.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>c = b.invert[]</code></p>
  
  <p>
   A dictionary can be cleared by using the <code>clear</code> method:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a.clear[]</code>
   <code>
    []
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
    A dictionary is often used to count occurrences of an item.  The
    methods <code>increment[<i>key</i>]</code>
    and <code>increment[<i>key</i>, <i>increment</i>]</code> method increments
    the value corresponding to the specified key by the specified count (in
    the first method, it increments by 1.)  It returns the new total.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    d=new dict</code>
   <code>
    [[a,2],</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   A dictionary is often used to store a list of occurrences corresponding to
   the specified key.  The
   functions <code>addToList[<i>key</i>, <i>value</i>]</code>
   or <code>addToSet[<i>key</i>, <i>value</i>]</code> pushes the specified
   value onto the list or set corresponding to the key and returns the new
   list or set.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    d=new dict</code>
   <code>
    [[a, [1, 2]],</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    d=new dict</code>
   <code>
    [[a, [1, 2]],</code>
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="Sets">Sets</a></h2>
  <p>
   A set is a data structure that contains items with no duplicates.  A set
   can currently contain strings, units, (that is, numbers),
   other sets, dictionaries, arrays, date/time values, or
   objects created from a <code>class</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   You simply create an empty set using <code>new set</code>, a literal set by
   calling something like <code>new set[1,2,3]</code>, or turn an array or
   <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> into a set by calling
   <code>toSet[<i>expr</i>]</code>.

  </p><p>
   <code>
    a = new set</code>  <br/>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    b = new set[1,2,3]</code>  <br/>
  </p>

    <p>
     <code>
      c = [3,6,9]  </code>
    </p>
  
  <p>
   Note that sets
   do not preserve any order of the items contained in them.  There are a
   variety of methods for modifying sets:
  </p>

  <p>
   Items are inserted into a set using the <code>put</code> method:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a.put[1]</code>
   <code>
    [1,2]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Multiple items from an array, set, or other <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> can be
   inserted into a set as separate items using the <code>putAll</code> method: 
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    b = new set</code>
   <code>
    [2,3,1]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Items are removed from a set using the <code>remove</code> method:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a.remove[2]</code>
   <code>
    [1]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   A set can be tested to see if it contains a value by using the
   <code>contains</code> method:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a.contains[1]<br/>
   </code>
   <code>
    true
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can get a shallow copy of a set by calling its
   <code>.shallowCopy[]</code> method.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    b = a.shallowCopy[]</code>
   <code>
    [1,2]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can make a shallow copy of a set and then add or remove an item from
   the set using its <code>.copyAndPut[<i>value</i>]</code>
   and <code>.copyAndRemove[<i>value</i>]</code>methods.  These are often
   useful in recursive routines.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   A set can be cleared by using the <code>clear</code> method:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a.clear[]</code>
   <code>
    []
   </code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   You can also enumerate over values contained in a set:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>for value = a</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The following demonstrates turning an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> into a set (the
   <code>lines[<i>url</i>]</code> function returns an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a>
   of all of the lines in a file,) turning that into an set (to remove
   duplicates) and sorting it (implicitly turning it into an array in the
   process.) The result is a sorted array containing all of the unique lines
   in a file, discarding duplicates.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    sort[toSet[lines[&#34;file:myfile.txt&#34;]]]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   To obtain all of the possible subsets of the elements in the set, you
   can use the <code><i>set</i>.subsets[]</code> method.  This returns an
   <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> which iterates through allt he subsets of items in
   the set, including the empty set and the original set itself.  Each
   return value is itself an set of elements.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = new set[1,2,3]</code>
   <code>
    [[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also request the subsets of the set and exclude either the empty
   set or the original set by using the
   <code><i>set</i>.subsets[<i>allowEmptySet</i>, <i>allowOriginalSet</i>]</code>
   method.  If <code>allowEmptySet</code> is <code>true</code>, the empty set
   will be returned as one of the elements.  If <code>false</code>, the empty
   set will be excluded. If <code>allowOriginalSet</code> is
   <code>true</code>, the full original set will be returned as one of the
   elements.  If <code>false</code>, the full original set will be excluded,
   and only &#34;proper&#34; subsets will be returned.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a = [1,2,3]</code>
   <code>
    [[1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3]]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that output of the empty set and the original set are suppressed in
   the example above.

      <em>either</em> set <code>a</code> <em>or</em> set <code>b</code>.

    </td></tr><tr><td>intersection[<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>]</td><td>Returns a new set
      whose value is the intersection of sets <code>a</code> and

      <code>b</code>.

    </td></tr><tr><td>setsIntersect[<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>]</td><td>Returns true if
      the two sets have a non-empty intersection.  That is, both sets contain
      at least one element in common.

      whose value is the difference of sets <code>a</code> and

      In other words, the new set contains only the elements
      that exist in set <code>a</code> <em>but not</em> in set
      <code>b</code>.  If the arguments are not sets, this tries to coerce the
      arguments into sets, so it can be used to get the differences of arrays
      as sets, for instance.  Note that ordering will be lost when
      differencing arrays.

    </td></tr><tr><td>symmetricDifference[<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>]</td><td>Returns a
      new set whose value is the &#34;symmetric difference&#34;, also known as the

      <code>b</code>.  In other words, the new set contains only the elements
      that are in either set <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> <em>but not</em>
      in both.  For example, the symmetric difference of the sets {1,2,3} and
      {3,4} is {1,2,4}.  If the arguments are not sets, this tries to coerce
      the arguments into sets, so it can be used to get the differences of

  <h2><a name="CommonFunctions">Common Functions</a></h2>
  <p>
   The most common trigonometric functions are built in.  They, as everything
   else in Frink, are best used when you explicitly specify the units.  For
   the following functions, input should be an angle, and output will come out
   dimensionless.  (If no unit is specified for input, it should act like
   radians, because radians <em>are</em> dimensionless units and really
   indistinguishable from pure numbers.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>sin[90 degrees]</code></p>

  <p>
   For inverse operations, the input must be dimensionless, and the output
   will come out in angular units.  (Radians, by default.)  This is easily
   converted to whatever angular units you want, as above.  You don&#39;t see that
   the output is in radians because radians are essentially dimensionless
   numbers.  You just gotta be a bit careful with angles.

  <h3><a name="FormattingFunctions">Formatting Functions</a></h3>
  <p>
   The following functions can be used to format numeric and unit expressions
   to a variety of formats.
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>Note:</i> the <code>-&gt;</code> operator is a formatting operator
   that <em>always returns a string</em>, so you can&#39;t format it any
   further.
  </p>

  <p>
   <em>This is wrong:</em></p>

  <p>
   This is right, and only converts and formats on output, which is
   usually what you want to do:</p>

  <p>
   In the following functions, the value can be number with units of measure,
    or any <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a>
    (array, set, <a href="#OrderedList">OrderedList</a>, etc.) with numerical values.  If the value is
    an array or other collection, these functions return an array of
    strings, which can then be formatted using other functions
    like <code>join</code>, <code>joinln</code>, etc.
  </p>
  
  <table summary="Formatting Functions">
   <tbody><tr><th>Function</th><th>Definition
      </th></tr><tr><td>format[value, divideBy, decPlaces]</td><td><b>Fixed-decimal-places format:</b>  Divides
      <code>value</code> by <code>divideBy</code> and returns a string with a
       fixed number (<code>decPlaces</code>) of digits <em>after</em> the
       decimal point.  If the value is
       an array or other collection, these functions return an array of
       strings, which can then be formatted using other functions
       like <code>join</code>, <code>joinln</code>, etc.  If the number is
       dimensionless without size, <code>divideBy</code> should be
      <code>1</code>. For example:
      
      <p>
       <code>format[3 meters, feet, 2]<br/></code>
       <code>9.84</code>
      </p>

       reasons:
      </p>

      <ul>
       <li>It requires additional work behind the scenes which makes it
        slower.  (That is, it needs to predict how many digits will be
        in the result after division, and then has to increase its working
        precision to calculate the full number of digits after the decimal
        point.)
       </li><li>It is not a very readable representation for very large or very
        small numbers.
       </li><li>It loses information for small numbers (less-significant digits
        may be lost or rounded or the number may be lost entirely.)
       </li><li>It is rarely a good choice for large numbers, as many of the
        decimal places will be meaningless or displayed as zero.
       </li><li>It&#39;s not quite as flexible as the other functions. It will not work
        if its arguments are not real numbers (<i>e.g.</i> complex numbers or
        intervals.  The other formatting functions <em>will</em> work in this
        case.)
      </li></ul>

      <p>
       The previous behavior of the <code>format</code> function was preserved
       to keep old programs working, but the default behavior of
       <code>format</code> <em>may</em> change in the future to another one of
       the formatting functions below.  The <code>formatFix</code> and
       <code>formatFixed</code> functions (which are identical to each other)
       will keep their current behavior, so it&#39;s probably better to use
       <code>formatFix</code> instead of <code>format</code> to future-proof
       your programs if this is the behavior your want to keep.

     functions will format a two-dimensional (or higher) array as a

     returns the result as a single string with embedded newlines
     and <code>formatTableLines</code> returns an array of strings with no
     newlines so you can layout and compose more complicated layouts.

      number of columns.  This can be used with the table formatting functions
      above to pretty-print a large array in columns for display.  For
      example, the following prints the first 25 prime numbers in 5 columns:
      
     <p>
      <code>formatTable[columnize[first[primes[], 25], 5], &#34;right&#34;]</code></p>

     To make the values in the table increase top-to-bottom then
     left-to-right, call the <code>.transpose[]</code> method on the output
     of <code>columnize</code>:
     <p>
      <code>formatTable[columnize[first[primes[], 25], 5].transpose[], &#34;right&#34;]</code></p>
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  <p>
   For example, to format a simple multiplication table:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = new array[[10,10],{|a,b| (a+1)*(b+1)}]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code> 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This can be combined with the formatting functions to, say, format a table
   of numbers to 5 significant digits:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>c = makeArray[[5,5], {|a,b| randomFloat[a,b]}]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>0.0000  0.70580 0.56481 6.0658e-2 0.95933</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Or, with <code>formatTableBoxed</code>, the table can be drawn with Unicode
   box-drawing characters.  These of course require a monospaced font and
   require your environment to be configured for Unicode output.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>b = [[1,2], [3,10]]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
┌─┬──┐</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If passed a one-dimensional array, <code>formatTable</code> will format it
   into column form, with optional alignment.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>b = makeArray[[5], {|a| 10^a}]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>    1</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   This can also be used for formatting fractions.

  <p>
   <code>symbolicMode[true]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>     F     </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   These formatting functions can work with multi-line strings, and as a
   result, they can be called recursively to typeset equations.  This is quite
   powerful.  See the sample
   program, <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=formatEquation.frink">formatEquation.frink</a>,
   which demonstrates more formatting of expressions using these functions.

    <tbody><tr><th>Function</th><th>Description

    </th></tr><tr><td>bitLength[<i>x</i>]</td><td>Returns the number of bits in
      the minimal two&#39;s-complement representation of an integer,
      <em>excluding</em> a sign bit.  In other words, this returns the index
      of the highest bit that differs from the sign bit.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>getBit[<i>num</i>, <i>bit</i>]</td><td>Returns an
      integer, either 0 or 1, indicating the value of the specified bit in an
      integer.  Bit 0 is the least-significant bit.  The number is treated as
      a two&#39;s-complement representation with infinite length.  That is, the
      high bits on a negative number will always be 1, and the high bits on a
      positive number or zero will always be 0.

    </td></tr><tr><td>getBitBool[<i>num</i>, <i>bit</i>]</td><td>Returns a
      boolean value, either false for 0 or true for 1, indicating the value of
      the specified bit in an integer.  Bit 0 is the least-significant bit.
      The number is treated as a two&#39;s-complement representation with infinite
      length.  That is, the high bits on a negative number will always be true,
      and the high bits on a positive number or zero will always be false.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>getLowestSetBit[<i>num</i>]</td><td>Returns the index of
      the rightmost (lowest-order) one bit in an integer (the number of
      zero bits to the right of the rightmost one bit). Returns -1 if the
      integer contains no one bits.

    </td></tr><tr><td>shiftLeft[<i>num</i>, <i>bits</i>]</td><td>Shifts the bits
      of an integer left by the specified number of bits.  New bits will
      contain zero.  This is equivalent to multiplying by 2<sup>bits</sup> but
      is usually more efficient.

    </td></tr><tr><td>shiftRight[<i>num</i>, <i>bits</i>]</td><td>Shifts the bits
      of an integer right by the specified number of bits, losing the bits
      pushed off the right side.  This is equivalent to performing a
      <code>div</code> by 2<sup>bits</sup> but is usually more efficient.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>bitAnd[<i>n</i>, <i>m</i>]</td><td>Returns the bitwise
      <code>AND</code> of two integers, treated as two&#39;s complement numbers
      with infinite sign bits.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>bitOr[<i>n</i>, <i>m</i>]</td><td>Returns the bitwise
      <code>OR</code> of two integers, treated as two&#39;s complement numbers
      with infinite sign bits.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>bitXor[<i>n</i>, <i>m</i>]</td><td>Returns the bitwise
      <code>XOR</code> (exclusive-or) of two integers, treated as two&#39;s
      complement numbers with infinite sign bits.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>bitNot[<i>n</i>]</td><td>Returns the bitwise
      <code>NOT</code> of an integer, treated as a two&#39;s complement number with
      infinite sign bits.  This means that performing a <code>bitNot</code> on
      a positive number will return a negative number, and vice-versa.  This
      may be unexpected if you&#39;re unfamiliar with two&#39;s complement notation,
      but functions like <code>getBit[<i>num</i>, <i>bit</i>]</code> and
      <code>bitLength[<i>num</i>]</code> will do the right thing, and will
      handle all leading sign bits correctly without you needing to specify
      the length of your numbers.  Please look up two&#39;s complement
      number representation if you&#39;re unfamiliar with this.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>bitNand[<i>n</i>, <i>m</i>]</td><td>Returns the bitwise
      <code>NAND</code> (an AND followed by a NOT) of two integers, treated as
      two&#39;s complement numbers with infinite sign bits.  See notes about
      <code>bitNot[<i>num</i>]</code> above.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>bitNor[<i>n</i>, <i>m</i>]</td><td>Returns the
      bitwise <code>NOR</code> (an OR followed by a NOT) of two integers,
      treated as two&#39;s complement numbers with infinite sign bits.  See notes
      about <code>bitNot[<i>num</i>]</code> above.

    </td></tr><tr><td>setBit[<i>n</i>, <i>bit</i>]</td><td>Sets the
      specified bit of a number (least significant bit is 0) to 1 and returns
      a new number. This is equivalent to
      <code>bitOr[<i>n</i>, shiftLeft[1, <i>bit</i>]]</code>.
      <code>n</code> is treated as a two&#39;s complement number with infinite
      sign bits.  See notes about <code>bitNot[<i>num</i>]</code> above.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>clearBit[<i>n</i>, <i>bit</i>]</td><td>Clears the
      specified bit of a number (least significant bit is 0) to 0 and returns
      a new number. This is equivalent to
      <code>bitAnd[<i>n</i>, bitNot[shiftLeft[1, <i>bit</i>]]]</code>.
      <code>n</code> is treated as a two&#39;s complement number with infinite
      sign bits.  See notes about <code>bitNot[<i>num</i>]</code> above.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>flipBit[<i>n</i>, <i>bit</i>]</td><td>Flips the
      specified bit of a number (least significant bit is 0) and returns
      a new number. This is equivalent to
      <code>bitXor[<i>n</i>, shiftLeft[1, <i>bit</i>]]</code>.
      <code>n</code> is treated as a two&#39;s complement number with infinite
      sign bits.  See notes about <code>bitNot[<i>num</i>]</code> above.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>rotateLeft[<i>n</i>, <i>bits</i>, <i>bitLength</i>]</td><td>Rotates
      the bits of an integer <code>n</code> left by <code>bits</code> bits,
      treating the number as <code>bitLength</code> (e.g. 32 is common) bits
      wide.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>rotateRight[<i>n</i>, <i>bits</i>, <i>bitLength</i>]</td><td>Rotates
      the bits of an integer <code>n</code> right by <code>bits</code> bits,
      treating the number as <code>bitLength</code> (e.g. 32 is common) bits
      wide.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>gcd[<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>]</td><td>Returns the greatest
      common divisor of the integers <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.

    </td></tr><tr><td>gcd[<i>array</i>]</td><td>Returns the greatest common
      denominator of an array
      (or <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a>) of
      integers.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>lcm[<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>]</td><td>Returns the least
      common multiple of the integers <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.

    </td></tr><tr><td>lcm[<i>array</i>]</td><td>Returns the least
      common multiple of an array
      (or <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a>) of
      integers.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>isPrime[<i>x</i>]</td><td>Returns false if the integer
      <code>x</code> is composite, true if the number is prime (or probably
      prime.)  This test uses trial division and then Rabin-Miller strong
      pseudoprime tests to determine primality.  The bases used in the
      Rabin-Miller test are known to <em>prove</em> primality for numbers
      smaller than 3,317,044,064,679,887,385,961,981, (see <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00864">Sorenson and Webster</a>) but for larger numbers
      this function can erroneously declare a composite number to be prime.
      (If it returns false, the number is definitely composite.)
      
      <p>
       If the number is larger than this, the test is performed against 78
       random prime bases.  This gives a <em>very</em> small probability of
       about 1 in 10<sup>47</sup> that the function may return
       <code>true</code> for a composite number.  (And that&#39;s a worst-case;
       for randomly-chosen large numbers, the probability of error is actually
       far, far lower for most numbers, especially big ones.  The above
       assumes the ridiculously low estimate that the pseudoprime test fails
       1/4 of the time.  The reality is orders of magnitude lower.  For better
       estimates, see <a href="https://primes.utm.edu/notes/prp_prob.html" target="_blank">Probable primes: How Probable?</a>)
      </p>
      
      <p>
       It is more likely that any of the following will happen:
      </p>

      <ul>
       <li>You cut-and-pasted the wrong number to be tested, maybe missing one
        digit.  (In my experience in prime number groups, this is <em>by
         far</em> the most likely source of error.)
        
       </li><li>Your hardware will fail and return the wrong answer (perhaps due to
        a cosmic ray hitting it.)

       </li><li>You&#39;ll flip a coin 156 times in a row and it will land on &#34;heads&#34;
        every time.

       </li><li>You&#39;ll play roulette and your number will get picked 29 times in a
        row.

       </li><li>You&#39;ll test a trillion numbers every second for the known lifetime
        of the universe and you&#39;ll still only have a miniscule 1 in
        10<sup>17</sup> chance of getting a single wrong answer.
      </li></ul>

      <p>
       And these are ridiculously generous estimates.  The actual probability
       of failure is usually astronomically lower than this.
      </p>

      <p>
       As of the 2005-11-13 release, <code>isPrime[<i>x</i>]</code> was
       extended to automatically use a faster Lucas-Lehmer test if <i>x</i> is
       of the form 2<sup>n</sup>-1 (<i>i.e.</i> Mersenne numbers).  Note that
       the Lucas-Lehmer test is sufficient to <em>prove</em> primality for
       numbers of this form, regardless of their size.
      </p>

      <p>
       Also note that <code>isPrime[1]</code> will return <code>true</code>.
       This simplifies recursive factor-finding algorithms, but I know it may
       not match the modern definition of primes.  This behavior may change,
       so try not to rely on it.

       Frink is not vulnerable to the attacks in the very
       interesting <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/749.pdf">Prime and
       Prejudice</a> paper.  You can test it with the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=PrimeAndPrejudice.frink">PrimeAndPrejudice.frink</a>
       sample program.
      </p>
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>factor[<i>x</i>]</td><td>Returns the prime factors of an
      integer <code>x</code> as a two-dimensional list.  This uses trial
      division, then the Pollard <i>p-1</i> method, and then the Pollard Rho
      method to find factors.  The factor list consists of a list of pairs of
      prime factors and the exponent of each factor:

      <p>
       <code>factor[1000]</code></p>

      <p>
       This indicates that the prime factors of 1000 are 2<sup>3</sup> *
       5<sup>3</sup>.
      </p>
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>factorFlat[<i>x</i>]</td><td>Returns the prime factors of an
      integer <code>x</code> as a one-dimensional list.  This uses trial
      division, then the Pollard <i>p-1</i> method, and then the Pollard Rho
      method to find factors.  The factor list consists of a list of prime
      factors, each possibly repeated.  This performs identically to the
      <code>factor[<i>x</i>]</code> function above; the output format is just
      different.

      <p>
       <code>factorFlat[1000]</code></p>
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>allFactors[<i>n</i>, <i>include1=true</i>,
      <i>includeN=true</i>, <i>sort=true</i>, <i>onlyToSqrt=false</i>]</td><td>Returns <em>all</em> factors
      of the integer <code>n</code>, <em>not just prime factors</em>.  The
      optional arguments <code>include1</code> and <code>includeN</code>
      indicate if the numbers 1 and n are to be included in the results.  If
      the optional argument <code>sort</code> is true, the results will be
      sorted. If the optional argument <code>onlyToSqrt</code>=true, then only
      the factors less than or equal to the square root of the number will be
      produced.  It currently returns an array, but that may change to an
      <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> someday to be more memory-efficient for numbers
      with huge amounts of factors.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>JacobiSymbol[<i>a,n</i>]</td><td>Returns the Jacobi symbol
      (often written as (a/n) ) of the integers <code>a</code> and
      <code>n</code>.  <code>n</code> must be a positive, odd integer.  This
      function is used in factorization and primality testing.  The Jacobi
      symbol is a generalization of the Legendre symbol, so it can be used to
      calculate the Legendre symbol of two numbers.  (The Legendre symbol is
      only defined if <code>n</code> is prime.)

    </td></tr><tr><td>isStrongPseudoprime[<i>num</i>, <i>base(s)</i>]</td><td>
      Returns true if <code>num</code> is a strong pseudoprime to base
      <code>base</code>.  If this returns false, the number is definitely
      composite.  If it returns true, the number <em>may</em> be prime.  This
      does <em>not</em> prove that a number is actually prime, as
      numbers can fail this test for up to 1/4 of bases.  This can be used as a
      component of a prime sieving algorithm (but be sure to do things like
      verify that the number is odd first!)

      <p>
       The argument <code>base</code> can also be an array of integers, in
       which case all of the bases are tested, bailing out when the number is
       known to be composite.  This may be slightly faster (and easier to
       code) in some cases.  You may be able to use this along
       with <a href="https://miller-rabin.appspot.com/" target="_blank">minimal sets of bases</a> (link opens in new window) to
       make an even faster primality test.

      </p><p>
       While the above paragraph correctly states that this test can fail for
       <em>up to</em> 1/4 of bases, the actual failure rate for larger numbers
       is many orders of magnitude smaller than that!  See <a href="http://primes.utm.edu/notes/prp_prob.html" target="_blank">Probable primes: How Probable?</a> (link opens in new
       window) for an estimate of how much lower the failure rate becomes.

    </p></td></tr><tr><td><code>nextPrime[<i>n</i>]</code></td><td>Returns the next
      prime number <em>greater than</em> <code>n</code>.  The value of
      <code>n</code> may be any real number.  This method uses a wheel
      factoring method to completely avoid testing composite numbers with
      small factors.

    </td></tr><tr><td><code>previousPrime[<i>n</i>]</code></td><td>Returns the
      previous prime number <em>smaller than</em> <code>n</code>.  The value
      of <code>n</code> may be any real number.  If <code>n</code> is smaller
      than 2, this returns <code>undef</code>.  This method uses a wheel
      factoring method to completely avoid testing composite numbers with
      small factors.

    </td></tr><tr><td><code>primes[]</code></td><td>Returns an infinite
      <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> that lists
      all of the prime numbers in ascending order.  Note that this will
      produce infinite output if you even try to print it, so you probably
      want to call it from a <code>for</code> loop or from something
      like <code>first[primes[], 100]</code>
      
    </td></tr><tr><td><code>primes[<i>begin</i>]</code></td><td>Returns an
      infinite <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a>
      that lists all of the prime numbers greater than or equal
      to <code>begin</code> in ascending order.  Note that this will produce
      infinite output if you even try to print it, so you probably want to
      call it from a <code>for</code> loop or from something
      like <code>first[primes[3], 100]</code>
      
    </td></tr><tr><td><code>primes[<i>begin</i>, <i>end</i>]</code></td><td>Returns
      a finite <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a>
      that lists all of the prime numbers greater than or equal
      to <code>begin</code> and less than or equal to <code>end</code>.
      If <code>begin</code> is <code>undef</code>, the enumeration begins with
      2.  If <code>end</code> is <code>undef</code>, the enumeration is
      potentially infinite.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td><code>nthPrime[<i>num</i>]</code></td><td>Returns the nth
      prime number (indexed with 1, that is, <code>nthPrime[1]</code> returns
      2 and <code>nthPrime[2]</code> returns 3.)
        
    </td></tr><tr><td><code>partitionCount[<i>n</i>]</code></td><td>Returns the
      number of ways that the integer n can be partitioned.  This uses Euler&#39;s
      pentagonal number algorithm to find the partition count somewhat
      efficiently, and caches the results so subsequent calls to this function
      will be efficient.

    </td></tr><tr><td><code>partitions[<i>n</i>]</code></td><td>Returns an
      enumeration of the partitions of the integer n.  For example:

      <p>
       <code>
        for a = partitions[4]</code>
       <code>
        [4]</code>
      </p>

    </td></tr><tr><td><code>partitionsCompact[<i>n</i>,
       <i>countPermutations=false</i>]</code></td><td>Like the
      <code>partitions</code> 
      function above, but returns a more compact enumeration of the partitions
      of the integer n.  Each list contains [num, count] pairs indicating the
      number and its count in a partition.  For example, compare the following
      representation with the one from the <code>partitions</code> function
      above.

      <p>
       <code>
        for a = partitionsCompact[4]</code>
       <code>
        [[4, 1]]</code>
      </p>

      <p>
       If the optional argument <code>countPermutations</code> is
       <code>true</code>, then each element also contains the number of
       possible permutations of the list.
      </p>

      <p>
       <code>
        for a = partitionsCompact[4, true]</code>
       <code>
        [[[4, 1]], 1]</code>
      </p>
      
    </td></tr><tr><td><code>binomial[<i>m,n</i>]</code></td><td>Returns the
     binomial coefficient.  This is of the number of ways <code>m</code>
     things can be chosen <code>n</code> at a time, with order being
     unimportant.  This is sometimes called &#34;m choose n&#34; or &#34;m C n&#34;.  This is
     equivalent to <code>m!/(n!*(m-n)!)</code> although calculating that way
     often leads to way-too-big numbers.  For example, <code>binomial[10000,
     9998]</code> is equal to 49995000, but if you calculated it naively,
     you&#39;d have to calculate 10000! which is a 35660-digit number, and divide
      it by another huge number, which could be inefficient and slow.
      <p>
       This will give the number of items returned by the
       the <a href="#Combinations"><code><i>array</i>.combinations[<i>take</i>]</code></a>
       method where <code>m</code> is the length of the array

    </td></tr><tr><td><code>permutationCount[<i>m,n</i>]</code></td><td>Returns
     the number of permutations of <code>m</code> things being
     taken <code>n</code> at a time, with order being important. This is
     sometimes called &#34;mPn&#34;.  This is equivalent to <code>m!/((m-n)!)</code>
     but calculated efficiently by calling <code>factorialRatio[m,m-n]</code>
     internally.
      <p>
       This will give the number of items returned by the
       the <a href="#Permutations"><code><i>array</i>.permute[]</code></a>
       method when <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are both the length of
       the array.

    </p></td></tr><tr><td><code>eulerPhi[<i>n</i>]</code></td><td>Returns Euler&#39;s
     Totient (also known as the phi function or Euler&#39;s Phi) of the given
     integer.  This is the number of positive integers less than n that share
      no factors with n.

      the factorial operator <code>!</code>.
      
      <p>
       <i>Reminder:</i> the factorial
       of a non-negative integer <code>n</code> is the product of all the

      It is better to use this function than to call <code>numerator</code>
      and <code>denominator</code> separately, as it&#39;s more efficient.

      <p>
       If <code>splitRationals</code> is <code>true</code> (the default), the
       numerator and denominators of rational numbers will be split into the
       numerator and denominator of the result.  If <code>false</code>, the
       rational numbers will be kept as rational numbers in the numerator of
       the result.
      </p>

      <p>
       If <code>splitDimensions</code> is <code>true</code> (the default),
       dimensions of units of measure with positive exponents will be split
       into the numerator and units of measure with negative exponents will be
       put into the denominator of the result.  If <code>false</code>, the
       dimensions will be kept together in the numerator of the result.

      <p>
       As you can see, sometimes it&#39;s more helpful to set both options
       to <code>false</code> when displaying results that are units of
       measure, and to set both to <code>true</code> when formatting symbolic
       equations.

      <p>
        If you specified the optional second or third arguments for the DFT

  <h2><a name="CryptographicFunctions">Cryptographic Functions</a></h2>
  <p>
   The <code>messageDigest[...]</code> functions can calculate a variety of
   cryptographic hashes of various strings or arrays of bytes.  The parameters
   for all are of the form:
  </p><p>
   <code>messageDigest[<i>input</i>,<i>algorithm</i>]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Each function can take as input either a string or an array of Java bytes.
   The <code>algorithm</code> parameter is a string containing one of any
   hashing algorithms your Java platform supports, which probably includes:
   <code>&#34;MD2&#34;, &#34;MD5&#34;, &#34;SHA&#34;, &#34;SHA-256&#34;, &#34;SHA-384&#34;, &#34;SHA-512&#34;</code>.  You
   can see the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=cryptoProviders.frink">cryptoProviders.frink</a>
   sample program to see how to dump all message digest types available on
   your virtual machine.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> As of the 2016-09-29 release, the behavior of the
   <code>messageDigest</code> functions may have changed.  Previously, to turn
   the characters of a Unicode string into bytes, the function used your
   platform&#39;s default character encoding.  Now the functions always convert
   the bytes to UTF-8 before creating the digest.  (Your default was likely to
   have been UTF-8 already.)  Using the default encoding made programs
   non-repeatable from one machine to another.  If you want to force a certain
   encoding of Unicode strings into bytes, use the <a href="#OtherStringFunctions"> <code>stringToBytes[<i>string</i>,
   <i>encoding</i>]</code></a> function before calling these functions.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following calculates the MD5 hash of the string <code>&#34;abc&#34;</code> and
   returns it as a hexadecimal string:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>messageDigest[&#34;abc&#34;, &#34;MD5&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   The <code>messageDigestInt</code> function returns the value as an integer,
   which can then be displayed in various bases, have its individual bits
   tested, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>messageDigestInt[&#34;abc&#34;,&#34;MD5&#34;] -&gt; octal</code></p>

  <p>
   The <code>messageDigestBytes</code> function returns the value as an
   array of Java bytes.  <b>Note:</b> Most of the underlying cryptography
   routines in Java work with arrays of bytes, as these are safer than Strings
   which are immutable after construction and are eventually
   garbage-collected.  Using arrays of bytes means that you can zero-out input
   buffers as soon as you&#39;re done with them.

  <h3><a name="CustomBaseConversions">Custom Base Conversions</a></h3>
  <p>
   The above base conversions assume that the characters are taken from an
   alphabet like the one for base 36:
   <code>&#34;0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz&#34;</code>, which is common and
   reasonable.  For example, hexadecimal uses the first 16 characters of
   this, <code>&#34;0123456789abcdef&#34;</code>.  However, it&#39;s not as clear when you
   go beyond base 36 what characters should be used.  You can declare a custom
   &#34;alphabet&#34; of any size to be used in base conversions.
  </p>

  <p>
   For example, Bitcoin addresses use a base-58 alphabet consisting of the
   characters:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>&#34;123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz&#34;</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that this alphabet does not include <code>0</code> (zero),
   <code>O</code> (uppercase o), <code>I</code> (uppercase i), <code>l</code>
   (lowercase L), as those are indistinguishable in some fonts.
  </p>

  <p>
   To convert a number to a string using this alphabet, you can use the
   <code>base[<i>num</i>, <i>alphabet</i>]</code> function where
   <code>alphabet</code> is a string which contains the character for the
   &#34;zero&#34; position first.  The radix will be equal to the number of characters
   in the alphabet string.  (In the below example, base 58.)  The following
   turns a numeric value into a Bitcoin address string:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>alphabet = &#34;123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz&#34;</code>
   <code>6UwLL9Risc3QfPqBUvKofHmBQ7wMtjvM</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   (Note that this alphabet does not have a zero as the first character (it
   has a 1,) so if you need to pad it to a certain length, you need to pad
   with the first character in the alphabet.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Conversely, you can parse an integer with a custom alphabet by using the
   <code>parseInt[<i>str</i>, <i>alphabet</i>]</code> function, which takes
   the same format for its alphabet string.  The example below parses a
   Bitcoin address.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>alphabet = &#34;123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz&#34;</code>
   <code>25420294593250030202636073700053352635053786165627414518</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   (Note that the number obtained above is the decimal equivalent of the
   Bitcoin address encoded above; it could instead be formatted in hexadecimal
   or other formats.)
  </p>

  <p>
   The strings are allowed to contain any Unicode characters.  If you attempt
   to parse a string that contains characters outside your alphabet, the
   special value <code>undef</code> will be returned.
  </p>

   <code>supAlphabet = &#34;\u2070\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3&#34; + char[0x2074 to 0x2079]</code>
   <code>10²³</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Or, conversely, to parse a stream of these superscript numerals as a single
   number:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>supAlphabet = &#34;\u2070\u00b9\u00b2\u00b3&#34; + char[0x2074 to 0x2079]</code>
   <code>23</code>

   Unicode superscript numerals can be used to perform exponentiation, such as
   <code>10⁻²³</code>, which is equivalent to
   <code>10^-23</code>, or <code>x³</code>, which is equivalent to
   <code>x^3</code>.
  </p>

  <p><b>Note:</b> Web pages usually <em>won&#39;t</em> use Unicode superscript

  <h3><a name="UnicodeInStrings">Unicode in Strings</a></h3>
  <p>
   For internationalization, Frink allows
   <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a> characters anywhere.
   Strings can contain Unicode characters, indicated in one of a few ways:

  </p><ul>
   <li>Directly entered with a Unicode-aware editor. If you <em>do</em> have a
    nifty editor that handles Unicode, or other character encodings, you can
    write your Frink program in full Unicode, and load it using the <a href="#CommandLineOptions"><code>--encoding <i>str</i></code></a>
    command-line switch.
    
   </li><li><code>\u</code>
    followed by exactly 4 hexadecimal digits [0-9a-fA-F] indicating the Unicode
    code-point.  For example, <code>&#34;\u2764&#34;</code> indicates the Unicode
      character &#34;HEAVY BLACK HEART&#34;.

   </li><li><code>\u{<i>XXXXXX</i>}</code> where <code>XXXXXX</code> is anywhere
    from 1 to 6 hexadecimal digits.  For example, <code>&#34;\u{1f435}&#34;</code> is
    the Unicode character &#34;MONKEY FACE&#34;.  Note that using this format is
    required because the hexadecimal value has more than 4 digits.

   </li><li>High Unicode characters (those with value higher than
    <code>\uFFFF</code>) can also be represented as a Unicode &#34;surrogate
    pair.&#34;  For example, the Unicode character &#34;MONKEY FACE&#34; can also be
    represented as two 4-hex-digit characters: <code>&#34;\ud83d\udc35&#34;</code>.
    This is for compatibility with environments (such as Java) that represent
    a character as 16 bits.  (The <a href="#InputForm"><code>inputForm[<i>expr</i>]</code></a> function
    will produce this format for cross-platform and cross-Java-version
    compatibility.)
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   The latter two allow Unicode characters to be placed into any ASCII text
   file, and edited by programs that don&#39;t understand Unicode.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>&#34;The symbol for micro is \u00b5&#34;</code></p>

  <h3><a name="UnicodeCharacterCodes">Unicode Character Codes</a></h3>
  <p>
   You can convert a character to its Unicode character code by using the
   <code>char[<i>x</i>]</code> function.
  </p>

  <p>
   If passed an integer, it returns the character with that Unicode character
   code:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>char[00b5\\16]</code></p>

  <p>
   If passed a single-character string, it returns the Unicode character code:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>char[&#34;A&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   If passed a multiple-character string, it returns the Unicode character
   code for each character in an array:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>char[&#34;Frink&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   If you always need an array of character codes, use the
   <code>chars[<i>x</i>]</code> function which turns a string into an array of
   character codes, even when passed a string containing only one character.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>chars[&#34;F&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   You can also obtain the results in a different base:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>hex[chars[&#34;Frink&#34;]]</code></p>

  <p>
   If passed an array of integers, the <code>char[<i>x</i>]</code> function
   returns a string:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>char[ [70, 114, 105, 110, 107] ]</code></p>

  <p>
   The <code>charList[<i>str</i>]</code> function returns a list of the
   characters in a string, each as a string of a single codepoint length.  As
   of the 2024-10-17 release, it uses an efficient cache to return results.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>charList[&#34;Frink&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   The <code>charNames[<i>str</i>]</code> function returns a list of the
   Unicode names of the characters (codepoints) in a string.  (Requires Java
   1.7 or later.)  This returns an empty string if a Unicode codepoint is
   undefined or if the Java Virtual Machine does not know its name (JVMs lag
   far behind the latest Unicode definitions.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>charNames[&#34;\u{1f63a}!&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   If passed an array of positive
   integers, <code>charNames[<i>ints</i>]</code> returns a list of the Unicode
   names of the characters in a string.  (Requires Java 1.7 or later.)  Note
   that Unicode characters are usually specified in hexadecimal, which
   requires prefixing hexadecimal integer values with <code>0x</code>:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>charNames[[0x1f63a, 0x21]]</code></p>

  <p>
   The <code>charName[<i>str</i>]</code> function works similarly to
   the <code>charNames</code> functions above but if passed a single-character
   string, it will return a single string.  (Requires Java 1.7 or later.)
   This returns an empty string if a Unicode codepoint is undefined or if the
   Java Virtual Machine does not know its name (JVMs lag far behind the latest
   Unicode definitions.)
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>charName[&#34;X&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   If passed a multiple-character string, <code>charName[<i>str</i>]</code>
   behaves the same as the <code>charNames</code> function and returns an
   array of character names.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The <code>charName[<i>int</i>]</code> function can also take a single
   integer as an argument.  It returns the name of the specified Unicode
   codepoint. (Requires Java 1.7 or later.)  Note that Unicode characters are
   usually specified in hexadecimal, which requires prefixing hexadecimal
   integer values with <code>0x</code>:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>charName[0x1f63a]</code></p>
   
  <h3><a name="CorrectStringParsing">Correct String Parsing</a></h3>
  <p>
   Frink provides several functions to process strings correctly using Unicode
   rules.  When working with Unicode, almost all algorithms should work on
   entire <em>strings</em> to be correct, not individual characters.  (This is
   why Frink doesn&#39;t even have a character type.)
  </p>

  <p>
   The following functions operate on strings and allow you to enumerate
   through their parts.  Each of the following returns an enumerating
   expression that allows you to loop through the contents of a string in
   different, Unicode-correct ways:
  </p>

  <table summary="Correct string parsing functions">
    <tbody><tr>
     <th>Function</th><th>Description
    </th></tr><tr>
     <td>graphemeList[<i>string</i>]
     </td><td>This returns an enumerating list of the <i>graphemes</i> in a string,
      each as a string of 1 or more Unicode codepoints.

      <p>
       To quote the Unicode standard:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        &#34;It is important to recognize that what the user thinks of as a
        &#39;character&#39;--a basic unit of a writing system for a language--may not
        be just a single Unicode code point. Instead, that basic unit may be
        made up of multiple Unicode code points. To avoid ambiguity with the
        computer use of the term character, this is called a user-perceived
        character. For example, &#39;G&#39; + acute-accent is a user-perceived
        character: users think of it as a single character, yet is actually
        represented by two Unicode code points. These user-perceived
        characters are approximated by what is called a grapheme cluster,
        which can be determined programmatically.&#34;
       </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
       For example, the string <code>&#34;g\u0308o&#34;</code>
       represents a <code>g</code> with combining diaeresis followed by the
       letter <code>o</code>.  Or, in other words,
       <code>&#34;g̈o&#34;</code>.  Note that while there are three
       Unicode codepoints, only two &#34;graphemes&#34; are displayed.
      </p>

      <p>
       As another example, the Devanagari string
       <code>&#34;\u0915\u094D\u0937\u093F&#34;</code>
       (shown as क्षि ) is recognized as a single
       grapheme and should generally be kept intact and counted as a single
       display glyph in functions like <code>graphemeLength[<i>str</i>]</code>
       below.
      </p>

      <p>
       The <code>reverse[<i>string</i>]</code> function now uses a
       grapheme-based reverse algorithm.  See below.
      </p>

    </td></tr><tr><td>graphemeLength[<i>str</i>]</td><td>Returns the length of a
      string in <em>graphemes</em>, counting multiple Unicode codepoints that
      should be combined together as a single display glyph as a single
      character.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>reverse[<i>str</i>]</td><td>Reverses the characters in a
      string.
      <p>
       <b>Note:</b>As of the 2016-05-27 release, this is a smarter reversal
       that follows Unicode rules to keep combining characters together and
       properly ordered.
      </p>

      <p>
       For example, the string <code>&#34;g\u0308o&#34;</code>
       represents a <code>g</code> with combining diaeresis followed by the
       letter <code>o</code>.  Or, in other words,
       <code>&#34;g̈o&#34;</code>.
       Reversing this naïvely would cause the diaeresis to incorrectly
       show over the <code>o</code> instead of the <code>g</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
       As another example, the Devanagari string
       <code>&#34;\u0915\u094D\u0937\u093F&#34;</code>
       (shown as क्षि ) is recognized as a single
       grapheme and the 4 Unicode codepoints that make it up are kept intact
       and not reversed.
      </p>

      <p>
       Yes, this stuff is tricky.  It may not always reverse strings to the
       exact rules used in your language, but it will attempt to reverse the
       string according to the rules encoded in the Unicode standard.
      </p>

      <p>
       If you, for some reason, need a naïve and broken string reversal,
       you can do something like:
      </p>

      <p>
       <code>reverse[charList[<i>string</i>]]</code>
      </p>

      <p>
       but keep in mind that this will <em>still</em> do the right thing like
       keeping surrogate pairs ordered correctly.  You&#39;ll have to try hard to
       make Frink do the wrong thing.  Don&#39;t do this.  It&#39;s never right for
       Unicode strings.  Frink tries to always work on Unicode
       <em>strings</em>, and not individual characters, as working on
       individual characters or codepoints is almost always the wrong thing to
       do when processing Unicode.

       <i>Unicode Normalization Forms</i></a>.

      <p>
       A Unicode string can use various methods to encode what is essentially
       the same character/glyph.  For example, the character
       <code>ô</code> can be represented as either <code>&#34;\u00F4&#34;</code>
       or <code>&#34;\u006F\u0302&#34;</code>.  The former is a &#34;precomposed&#34;
       character, &#34;LATIN SMALL LETTER O WITH CIRCUMFLEX&#34;, and the latter is
       two Unicode codepoints, an <code>o</code> followed by &#34;COMBINING
       CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT&#34;.  (This is usually referred to as a &#34;decomposed&#34;
       representation.)   Unicode normalization rules can convert these
       &#34;equivalent&#34; encodings into a canonical representation.
      </p>

      <p><a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/" target="_blank">Unicode
       Standard Annex #15</a> currently defines four different methods of
       converting between these representations.  (You might get the best idea
       of the differences between these by looking at figure 6 in the
       document.)
      </p>

      <p>The <code>method</code> parameter is a string containing the names of
       one of these conversion methods, which can consist of
       <code>&#34;NFC&#34;</code> (the default), <code>&#34;NFD&#34;</code>,
       <code>&#34;NFKD&#34;</code>, and <code>&#34;NFKC&#34;</code>.  Please read <a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/">Unicode Standard Annex #15</a>
       for a description of the differences in these algorithms, as the
       procedures involved are quite detailed and beyond the scope of this
       document.  Again, figure 6 in that document will give you a quick idea
       of the diferences.
      </p>

      <p>
       In short, for many purposes, <code>&#34;NFC&#34;</code> is recommended for
       interchange, and for its compactness and simplicity, and is thus the
       default.
      </p>

      <p>
       If the string is already normalized to the requested form, the
       original string is returned unmodified.
      </p>

      <p>
       This normalization process is useful when, say, using Unicode strings
       as dictionary keys.  Two different keys that might be considered
       identical may not have the same representation without normalization.

     <td>substr[<i>string</i>, <i>startPos</i>, <i>endBefore</i>]</td><td>
      Takes the substring of string <code>str</code> beginning with
      <code>startPos</code> and ending <em>before</em> the character position
      <code>endBefore</code>.
      The length of the substring will be <code>endBefore-startPos</code>.

      <code>startPos</code> and containing <code>len</code> characters.

    </td></tr><tr>
     <td>left[<i>string</i>, <i>len</i>]</td><td>
      Returns a string containing the leftmost or rightmost characters of the
      given string with the specified length.  If <code>len</code> is
      negative, it returns a string with <code>-len</code> characters removed,
      that is, if the original string is 5 characters long, and
      <code>len</code> is <code>-1</code>, 4 characters are returned.  In any
      case, if the original string is shorter than the number of characters
      requested, the string returned will contain only the number of
      characters available, but will not return an error.

       To quote the Unicode standard:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        &#34;It is important to recognize that what the user thinks of as a
        &#39;character&#39;--a basic unit of a writing system for a language--may not
        be just a single Unicode code point. Instead, that basic unit may be
        made up of multiple Unicode code points. To avoid ambiguity with the
        computer use of the term character, this is called a user-perceived
        character. For example, &#39;G&#39; + acute-accent is a user-perceived
        character: users think of it as a single character, yet is actually
        represented by two Unicode code points. These user-perceived

  <h3><a name="UnicodeProperties">Unicode Properties</a></h3>
  <p>
   The Unicode standard defines various properties of each character (called
   codepoints).  Frink gives you several functions to query properties of
   each codepoint.
  </p>

  <p>
   The Unicode &#34;General Category&#34; property defines long and short category
   names for each type of character, for example, &#34;<code>Letter, uppercase</code>&#34; and
   &#34;<code>Lu</code>&#34;.  See
   the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch04.pdf">The
   Unicode Standard, section 4.5</a>.

   For example, the following program prints a table of all currency symbols
   (general category &#34;<code>Sc</code>&#34;) defined in Unicode :
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>for i=0 to 0x1FFFF</code>

  <h3><a name="MultiLineStrings">Multi-Line Strings</a></h3>
  <p>
   Text surrounded by three sets of double-quotes is a multi-line string (like
   in Python.)  Newlines are allowed and retained in the string. Hopefully,
   this is less burdensome and error-prone than Perl&#39;s &#34;here-document&#34; syntax.
   For example:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    lyrics = &#34;&#34;&#34;Oh, Danny Boy,</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This is also useful when you have strings that contain double quotes, as it
   eliminates the need for escaping those quotes:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>quote = &#34;&#34;&#34;We will say &#34;ni&#34; to you again if you do not appease us.&#34;&#34;&#34;</code>
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="StringInterpolation">String Interpolation</a></h3>
  <p>
   If a double-quoted string or multi-line string contains a dollar sign
   (<code>$</code>) followed by a variable name (which must begin with a
   letter), the value of that variable is replaced in the string at evaluation
   time.  This is (probably) faster than string concatenation which could be
   used to get the same effect.  There are certain optimizations to make sure
   that this isn&#39;t significantly more inefficient if the string doesn&#39;t need
   replacement.  (The string is checked for dollar signs at compile time.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>first = &#34;Inigo&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   If you need to explicitly mark where the variable name begins and ends, you
   can put it in curly braces as below:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>last=&#34;Frink&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   Since a variable name must begin with a letter, it&#39;s fine to put a quantity
   like <code>$2.00</code> into the string, and no substitution will be
   attempted, and there will be no runtime performance penalty.  To put a
   literal dollar sign into the string immediately preceding an letter
   character, use two dollar signs:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>&#34;I want my $$USD 2.00.  Plus tip.&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   For best performance, <em>don&#39;t</em> use double dollar signs like this
   unless they directly precede an letter character.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can always use this technique to coerce a numeric value, or a unit, or
   a date, etc., to a string representation by enclosing it in quotes:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>n = 2^13367-1</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   After the above code, the variable <code>stringRep</code> contains the
   result of the calculation <em>as a string</em> which you can use to grab
   certain characters, truncate, etc. Note that the
   <code>toString[<i>expr</i>]</code> function does the same thing, and can
   often be used on the same line.

  <p>
   Nice translation.  All of these are equivalent to calling the same-named
   function:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>German[&#34;My hovercraft is full of eels.&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   Or, to translate <em>from</em> another language, use the
   <code>From<i>Language</i></code> conversion, or the appropriate keyword:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code><span lang="es">&#34;Yo quiero un burrito.&#34;</span> -&gt;
    FromSpanish</code></p>

  <p>
   (Thanks to Brian C. White discovering the above gem of translation, which
   is literally correct.)  So it&#39;s not perfect, and it sure helps if your
   operating system is set up to display Unicode characters correctly.  Or,
   you can do round-trips:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>&#34;The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.&#34; -&gt;
    Spanish -&gt; <span lang="es">Ingles</span></code></p>

  <p>
   You can also define a function to do the same as the above:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>corrupt[x] := x -&gt; Spanish -&gt; <span lang="es">Ingles</span></code></p>

  <p>
   You can also build up more complex strings:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>&#34;The German word for \&#34;dog\&#34; is \&#34;&#34; + German[&#34;dog&#34;] + &#34;.\&#34;&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   And you can use Frink to not just translate the words, but the words and
   the units:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>&#34;My farm is &#34; + (220000 acres -&gt; &#34;hectares&#34;) + &#34;,
    but it&#39;s not arable land.&#34; -&gt; German</code></p>

  <p>
   <code>&#34;Gasoline costs &#34; + (round[1.37 USD/gallon /
    (EUR/liter), 0.01]) + &#34; Euro/liter in the United States.&#34; -&gt; German</code></p>

  <p>
   Ooh, that&#39;s cool.  If I had this when I lived in Germany, I might have
   seemed semi-literate.

  <h3><a name="GoogleTranslations">Google Translations</a></h3>
  <p>
   As of 2011-12-01, Google has eliminated free access to their translation
   APIs, so they are no longer available through Frink.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="TranslatorProgram">Translator Program</a></h3>
  <p>
   Here&#39;s a small program that can be used to make a mini-translator for a
   specific language.  It allows you to enter phrases to be translated without
   entering the quotes and other bits.  It will continue to translate phrases
   until you click the &#34;OK&#34; button without entering a phrase, or until you
   cancel the dialog using your windowing system&#39;s methods.  (See <a href="#MakingInteractiveInterfaces">Making Interactive Interfaces</a> for
   more details.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>while phrase=input[&#34;Enter phrase in Portuguese: &#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <h2><a name="ParsingJSON">Parsing JSON</a></h2>
  <p>
   Even though <a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">JSON</a>
   (JavaScript Object Notation) is a terrible standard based on an even more
   terrible language, (JavaScript doesn&#39;t even have <em>integers</em>, if
   you can believe that,) you can still parse it easily in Frink.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>parseJSON[<i>string</i>]</code> will parse a JSON document and return
   it as a Frink datatype.  Objects are converted to a Frink <code>dict</code>
   with the keys stored as strings.  The <code>null</code> type is converted
   to <code>undef</code>.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></h3>  
  <p>
   As a demonstration of JSON parsing, the following example reads from a
   remote URL which returns a JSON document, making the current value of
   Bitcoin into a globally-accessible Frink unit according to the CoinDesk
   Bitcoin Index (Powered by <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/price/" target="_blank">CoinDesk</a>).  See the <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/api/" target="_blank">CoinDesk API</a> for
   information about the various data sources available.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that the following program is essentially a one-line program that
   parses a JSON document and extracts its data with correct units of measure
   in the result.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    bitcoin := parseJSON[read[&#34;http://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice/USD.json&#34;]]@&#34;bpi&#34;@&#34;USD&#34;@&#34;rate_float&#34; USD</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The value of a certain number of Bitcoins can be then converted like any
   other currency.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>0.1 bitcoin</code></p>

  <p>
   Or, you can convert in the reverse direction, for example, if you want to
   pay someone 10 Euro:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>10 Euro -&gt; bitcoin</code></p>
  

  <p>
   This code is available, with more comments, in the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=bitcoin.frink">bitcoin.frink</a> sample program.
  </p>

  <p>
   Also, if this is useful to you, you can pay me in Bitcoin at the address: <code>1dersa3eR2tXQATLCqTrqQ84aecpQBVmm</code>

  </p><h2><a name="DateTimeHandling">Date/Time Handling</a></h2>
  <p>
   Frink has the ability to define specific points in time and add time
   intervals to them, to convert between timezones, or to subtract dates from
   each other.  Date literals are surrounded by pound signs (<code>#</code>)
   and can be entered in a wide variety of formats, but I prefer a format like:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code># yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss #</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that I&#39;ve chosen to have most-significant digits first, as is only
   logical (the world will realize this someday.) You can have whitespace
   preceding or following the # signs for readability.  All of the predefined
   formats are defined in
   <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkdata/dateformats.txt"><code>/data/dateformats.txt</code></a>.
   Check that file first to see the formats that are already defined.  If the
   format you want is not there, see below for ways to define your own
   formats.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also parse a string into a date using the
   <code>parseDate[<i>string</i>]</code> function.  This returns the string
   parsed into a date/time datatype, or returns <code>undef</code> if the
   string cannot be parsed as a date using any of the defined date formats.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="SpecifyingTimezones">Specifying Timezones</a></h3>
  <p>
   All date/time formats also allow a timezone specifier at the end.  This
   timezone specifier can be a 3-letter code like &#34;UTC&#34; or &#34;MST&#34;, but you can
   also use the name of a country or U.S. state (if the country or state has a
   single time zone) or a selected city (of course, not all cities are
   available.)  This means that you don&#39;t have to know when daylight savings
   time starts and ends.  The names are chosen from the globally-used Olson
   timezone database, and Frink allows shortening of the Olson timezones, say,
   from &#34;Europe/Paris&#34; to simply &#34;Paris&#34;.  The following are all valid inputs:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code># 2002-01-03 10:00 AM New York #</code></p>

  <p>
   If you do <em>not</em> specify a timezone, the timezone used will be the
   timezone obtained from your Java Virtual Machine (which is probably the
   timezone set on <em>your</em> computer.)
  </p>

  <h4><a name="CustomTimezones">Custom Timezones</a></h4>
  <p>
   While the Olson timezone database is very complete, and has named rules for
   basically all official timezones in the world, sometimes your data source
   only tells you the offset from UTC or GMT, or may even have custom offsets
   in minutes.  If this is the case, the timezone offset from UTC can be
   specified in one of the following formats:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>+0700
   </li><li>-0700
   </li><li>+07:00
   </li><li>-07:00
   </li><li>GMT+0700
   </li><li>GMT-0700
   </li><li>GMT+07:00
   </li><li>GMT-07:00
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   (Please note that, due to the plus and minus symbols, these timezone
   specification must be in double quotes on the right-hand-side of
   the <code>-&gt;</code> operator:)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code># August 25, 2019 16:00 # -&gt; &#34;GMT+07:00&#34;</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   So, for example, if your data source is in the ISO-8601 format that doesn&#39;t
   allow you to use named timezones (it only allows only numbered timezones or
   the letter <code>Z</code>) and looks like:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>2014-06-02T02:24:10-06:00</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Then Frink will parse the trailing <code>-06:00</code> as a timezone
   specification.  (Again, see all the date formats that Frink parses by
   default in the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkdata/dateformats.txt"><code>/dateformats.txt</code></a> file.)
  </p>

  <p>
   The trailing <code>Z</code> (for &#34;Zulu time&#34;, an alias for UTC,) in the
   following ISO-8601 format indicates that the time is in UTC.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>2014-06-02T02:24:10Z</code>
  </p>

  <h4><a name="TimezoneWarning">Timezone Warning</a></h4>
  <p>
   <b>Warning:</b> The Olson timezone database and the POSIX standard (and the
   Java Virtual Machine) define timezones called something like
   <code>Etc/GMT+7</code> (or, using Frink&#39;s shorter notation,
   <code>GMT+7</code>), but you must be <em>most strongly warned</em> that the
   sign convention of these zones is <em>opposite</em> of what any rational
   person would choose, and <em>opposite</em> of the other sign conventions in
   Frink!  In the Olson/POSIX/Java world, <code>GMT-7</code> is actually 7
   hours <em>ahead/east</em> of GMT.  Yes, in that weird world,
   <code>GMT-7</code> means GMT <em>plus</em> seven hours.  Augh.  (And you
   wonder why all of my documentation is full of diatribes against the
   stupidity of almost every major standard.)
  </p>

  <p>
   This is a horrible, insane convention and it <em>will</em> bite you or the
   people you try to communicate with (unless you both accidentally share the
   same random form of insanity and wrongness.)  They will think you are crazy
   if you follow this convention.  Yet it&#39;s the convention used by a large
   fraction of the world&#39;s software, so Frink keeps these timezones around
   (for now) in case you have to communicate with other software that uses the
   insane Olson/POSIX conventions.  But <em>do not</em> use these conventions
   otherwise.
  </p>

  <p>
   The 4-digit timezone formats listed in the <a href="#CustomTimezones">Custom Timezones</a> section above use correct and
   rational definitions of these sign conventions.  If you are using custom
   timezones, you are most strongly warned to use the 4-digit versions like
   <code>GMT+0200</code> or <code>GMT+12:00</code>.  These will be correct.
   <code>GMT+0200</code> will mean GMT <em>plus</em> 2 hours.  But don&#39;t
   confuse these 4-digit versions with the shorter 1- or 2-digit
   Olson/POSIX/Java versions like <code>GMT+2</code> or <code>GMT+12</code> or
   <code>Etc/GMT+2</code> which should be considered weird and wrong (unless
   you&#39;re communicating with a source that produces these timezone names
   according to the weird and wrong Olson/POSIX/Java rules.  For now, Frink
   will let you use those weird conventions, but it will scowl and furrow its
   brow at you and someday in the future it may not allow them at all.  I might
   completely disallow the shorter versions of these timezone names
   (<i>i.e.</i> reject <code>GMT+7</code> while still allowing the more
   foolhardy <code>Etc/GMT+7</code>)
  </p>

  <h3><a name="ListingTimezones">Listing Timezones</a></h3>
  <p>
   The function <code>timezones[]</code> will return an enumeration of all
   known time zone names.
  </p>

  <p>
   Please note that your Java implementation may not
   have all of the timezones named in these examples.  Notably, Java 1.1
   distributions tended to use only a small number of three-letter timezones,
   like <code>JST</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   The function <code>timezones[<i>pattern</i>]</code> with one argument will
   return all timezone names that match the specified pattern.  The pattern
   can be anything matched by the <a href="#select">select</a> function: that
   is, a function (that returns <code>true</code> for matches,) a regular
   expression, or an exact substring.  The following returns all the names of
   all timezones that contain the exact string <code>&#34;Central&#34;</code>:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>timezones[&#34;Central&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   The following example will return the timezones that contain the specified
   string &#34;Den&#34; with a case-insensitive match, using the <a href="#select"><code>select</code></a> function and a <a href="#RegularExpressions">regular expression</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>select[timezones[], %r/Den/i]</code></p>

  <p>
   The function <code>timezone[]</code> with no arguments will return the name
   of the default timezone.
  </p>
  
  <!-- Let's consider this not working. 
  <H3><A NAME="SettingDefaultTimezone">Setting Default Timezone</A></H3>
  <P>
   By default, Frink displays and parses all dates using the timezone
   specified by your operating system, unless the date string being parsed
   contains an explicit timezone (see <A HREF="#SpecifyingTimezones">
   "Specifying Timezones"</A> section above,) or if the output format contains 
   an explicit timezone name (see <A HREF="#TimezoneConversions">"Timezone
   Conversions"</A> section.)
  </P>

  <P>
   You can change the default timezone (used for parsing <EM>and</EM> output)
   by calling the function:
  </P>
  
  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">setDefaultTimezone[<I>tzstring</I>]</CODE>
  </P>

  <P>
   where <CODE><I>tzstring</I></CODE> is the name of a timezone that Frink
   recognizes.  If the timezone name is not recognized, an error will be
   displayed and the default timezone will be unchanged.  For example, if you
   want all times to be parsed and displayed as if they were in Universal
   Coordinated Time (unless an explicit timezone identifier is given,) you can
   call:
  </P>

  <P CLASS="code">
   <CODE CLASS="input">setDefaultTimezone["UTC"]</CODE>
  </P>
  -->

  <h3><a name="SloppyTimeSpecifications">Sloppy Time Specifications</a></h3>
  <p>
   If you don&#39;t specify an exact date, the date will be treated roughly as
   &#34;today.&#34;  This is useful for getting a quick-and-dirty timezone conversion,
   but if you want to get the day right, you should specify the date as above.
  </p>

  <p>
   Conversion to local timezone, assuming today:</p>

  <p>
   Conversion of local time to another timezone:</p>
   
  <p>
   Conversion between arbitrary timezones:</p>

  <p>
   Note that running the above simplified conversions at different times of
   the year will give you different results because of differences in the
   Daylight Savings Time rules for each country.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Also, please note that your Java implementation may not
   have all of the timezones named in these examples.  Notably, Java 1.1
   distributions tended to use only a small number of three-letter timezones,
   like <code>JST</code>.  Use the <a href="#ListingTimezones"><code>timezones[]</code></a> function to list the
   timezones defined on your system.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="CurrentTime">Current Time</a></h3>
  <p>
   The function <code>now[]</code> will return the current
   date/time.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   In an interactive session, you can use the string <code>##</code> as shorthand for &#34;now.&#34;  This should evaluate to
   the time at which the value was <em>parsed</em>, which is why it won&#39;t
   usually do what you intend in a program... the value would be the time the
   program was originally run and parsed.
  </p>

  <p>
   Time is only as accurate as your computer&#39;s clock
   setting.  (I use <a href="http://www.atomtime.com/">AtomTime</a> on Windows
   machines to keep the clock synchronized to the atomic clock.)
  </p>


  <h3><a name="TimezoneConversions">Timezone Conversions</a></h3>
  <p>
   By default, times are displayed in the local timezone and using your locale
   information (but are internally stored correctly in Julian Day relative to
   Universal Time.)  You can also convert to another time format by specifying
   it after the arrow operator.  &#34;JD&#34; for Julian Day, &#34;JDE&#34; for Julian Day
   (Ephemeris) referenced to Dynamical Time, &#34;MJD&#34; for Modified
   Julian Day are supported, as well as finding the times in selected
   timezones, cities and countries:
  </p>

  <p>Example: <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> predicted 
   that the peak of this year&#39;s Perseid meteor shower might be around August
   12, 2001 at 0400 UTC:
  </p>

  <p>Converting to local time (the default behavior:)</p>

  <p>Converting to another time zone:</p>

  <p>
   Current time in Germany:</p>

  <p>
   Current time in another state that just has a single timezone:</p>

  <p>
   Current Julian Day:</p>

  <p>
   Current Julian Day Ephemeris:</p>

  <p>
   Convert Julian Day Ephemeris to a date:</p>

  <p>
   Actually, since 2003-06-12, Frink uses full precision (usually rational
   numbers) when storing dates, so the Julian day may come out as a rational
   number like:

   If you don&#39;t desire this much precision, you can use the
   <code>JD[<i>date</i>]</code> or <code>MJD[<i>date</i>]</code> function and
   divide by <code>1.0 days</code> to get the Julian date as a
   floating-point number, not a string or a rational number:

  <h3><a name="DateTimeArithmetic">Date/Time Arithmetic</a></h3>
  <p>
   You can subtract one date from another, or add/subtract a time interval to
   a date.  So, if I wanted to find out when I was 1 billion seconds old, I
   add it to my birthdate:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>#1969-08-19 16:54 Mountain# + 1 billion seconds</code></p>

  <p>
   That was pretty recently.  You not only forgot my birthday but you forgot
   my 1-billion-second-anniversary.  Bastard.  I have a 
   <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/wishlist/1HBWTNB5L6H3J/ref=wl_em_to?add-fav=1">wish list</a> at Amazon.com if you still want to buy me something.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> You may notice that adding units of months or years (or
   commonyear, etc.)  may not give you the results you expect--that is because
   months and years are <em>not</em> fixed-size units, and even having a unit
   called &#34;month&#34; or &#34;year&#34; is inherently ill-advised.  Perhaps later there
   will be &#34;increment/decrement&#34; of these individual fields on Date objects,
   but it&#39;s better to make sure that you understand these are <em>also</em>
   inherently troublesome and often meaningless operations.  (<i>e.g.</i> what
   does it mean to increment the month on a date representing Jan. 31?)  Use
   fixed-size units if you can.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can subtract one date from another, and receive an answer as a Unit
   with dimensions of time (that you can convert to any scale you
   want... you&#39;re used to this by now.)  For example, if you want to know how
   many days until Christmas:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>#2002-12-25# - now[] -&gt; days</code></p>

  <p>
   (Try inverting the above calculation to see exactly when I wrote this!)
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that these calculations do not take leap seconds into account by
   default.  If you want these calculations to take leap seconds into account,
   see the <a href="#LeapSeconds">Leap Seconds</a> section of the
   documentation.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="CalendarFunctions">Calendar Functions</a></h3>
  <p>
   The human-defined Gregorian (and Julian) calendars are full of weirdnesses
   and inconsistencies.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   However, sometimes you still need to iterate through these varying-length
   units.  Frink gives a variety of functions to manipulate calendar dates.
   The functions are intentionally chosen to be functions that make sense, and
   Frink tries to avoid providing functions that don&#39;t make sense (for
   example, some date/time libraries let you take a date like January 31, 2019
   and increment the month field.  Since there is no Feburary 31, the results
   simply don&#39;t and can&#39;t make any sense.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that these functions will sometimes produce surprising (but
   consistent) results!  Years and months are of varying length.  Some years
   are longer than others by a day (because of leap days.)  Some years are
   longer than others by a second (because of leap seconds).  Some days or
   months are longer or shorter than others depending on your Daylight Saving
   / Summer Time rules!  For example, in the &#34;US/Mountain&#34; timezone, the month
   of March, 2019 is only 30 days, 23 hours long, not 31 days!  Similarly,
   November, 2019 is 31 days, 1 hour long!  In another timezone, it may be
   exactly 31 days!  Some days are 25 hours long, while others are 23 hours
   long!  Yay calendars!

     </td><td>Returns a date/time corresponding to the beginning of the specific
      timestep (e.g. year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond) and
      (optionally) allows you to increment or decrement that timestep by an
      integer amount.  The parameters are:

      <ul>
       <li><code>date</code>:  A date/time indicating an instance in time.
        
       </li><li><code>field</code>: One of the constants in Calendar.fields that
        indicates which field we&#39;re going to increment.  This is limited to
        the following: Calendar.YEAR, Calendar.MONTH, Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH,
        Calendar.HOUR_OF_DAY, Calendar.MINUTE, Calendar.SECOND,
        Calendar.MILLISECOND.  This field also controls the timestep we&#39;re
        finding the beginning of.  For example, if called with Calendar.YEAR,
        the initial time calculated will be the beginning of the calendar year
        that contains <code>date</code>.  The field constants can be obtained
        by something like:

        <p>
         <code>staticJava[&#34;java.util.Calendar&#34;, &#34;MONTH&#34;]</code>

         This may be positive, negative, or zero, but it must fit into a
         signed 32-bit int due to restrictions in the Java API.

         <p>
          For example,
          if <code>field</code> is <code>Calendar.YEAR</code> and 
          <code>offset</code> is <code>0</code>, this function returns a
          date/time corresponding to the beginning of the calendar year that

          a date/time corresponding to the beginning of the <em>next</em>
          calendar year after the year that contains <code>date</code>.
          Similarly, if <code>offset</code> is <code>-1</code>, this returns
          the beginning of the <em>previous</em> year.
         </p>

        </li><li><code>tz</code>: A string indicating the timezone of the result.

       <p>
        Note that this may produce surprising results!  Under some timezone
        rules, some days (and months) may be an hour longer or shorter than
        you expect due to Daylight Saving / Summer Time rules!  For example,
        in most US timezones, March is one hour shorter than 31 days because
        the clocks are set forward one hour (at 2:00 AM on the second Sunday
        of March)!  In other timezones, (like UTC) this shift may not
        occur.  Handling the varying lengths is necessary for consistency in
        date/time math.

   Lest you think this is simpler than it is, these functions also handle
   historical transformations like the switch between the Julian and Gregorian

  <h3><a name="NotesOnDates">Notes on Dates</a></h3>
  <p>
   <b>Note:</b>  The following notes apply to Frink release 2008-08-02 and
   later.  Previous releases may have handled the transition between Julian
   and Gregorian dates and large BC years inconsistently.
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Frink models the switch between the Julian and Gregorian calendars.
    This switch occurs between October 4, 1582 (Julian) which
    was followed immediately by October 15, 1582 (Gregorian).  However, you
    should be warned that many countries observed the switch from the Julian
    to the Gregorian calendar in later years. (As late as 1918 in Russia, or
    1923 for Greece.)  When reviewing historical dates, you need to verify and
    double-check your author&#39;s assumptions about dates and calendar systems.

   </li><li>Dates prior to this switch date are parsed and displayed as their dates
    in the Julian calendar.

   </li><li>Frink follows Julian leap year rules before the switch date (all years
    divisible by 4 are leap years) and Gregorian leap year rules after the
    switch (if a year is divisible by 100, it is only a leap year if it is
    also divisible by 400.  Otherwise, all other years divisible by 4 are leap
    years.)

   </li><li>Parsing a date between the switch dates will result in undefined
    behavior.

   </li><li>Julian date <code># AD 0001-01-01 #</code> (Julian) was preceded
    immediately by <code># BC 0001-12-31 #</code> (Julian).  There is no year
    0, and negative years are intentionally disallowed when parsing, as they
    are often treated inconsistently by authors and scholars.  Again, if you
    encounter a negative year in a publication, you need to examine your
    author&#39;s assumptions about years before AD 0001.
  </li></ul>

  <h2><a name="DefiningNewDateTimeFormats">Defining New Date/Time Formats</a></h2>
  <p>
   If you want to enter date/time values in a specific format, you can enter
   new date formats on the fly.  Date formats are enclosed between sets of 3
   pound signs: <code>###<i>pattern</i>###</code>.  After defining a new
   pattern, dates between pound signs should be recognized.  For readability,
   you may have leading or trailing space in your formats or dates.  For
   example:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>### yyyy-MM-dd ###</code></p>

  <p>
   You can also define the default <em>output</em> format with 4 pound signs.
   Without a definition in the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkdata/dateformats.txt">dateformats.txt</a> file, you get the
   Java default (which should theoretically get it from your system&#39;s
   settings, or mine if you&#39;re using the web interface,) but for lots of info,
   try something like:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>#### G yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss.SSS a (E) zzzz ####</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Date format expressions can be assigned to variables and/or used on the
   right-hand side of a conversion operator ( <code>-&gt;</code> ).  To output
   a date in a specified format, use something like:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>fmt = ### HH:mm ###</code></p>

  <p>
   If you want to format a date with both a specific format and a timezone,
   make the right-hand-side of the conversion operator into a 2-argument
   bracketed list with the first argument indicating the date format and the
   second a <em>string</em> indicating the timezone name:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>fmt = ### yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm a (E) zzzz ###</code></p>

  <p>
   In these patterns, all ASCII letters are reserved as pattern letters,
   which are defined as the following:

   Internally, all dates are represented as the Julian Day (which is
   essentially just a numeric value indicating the number of days and
   fractions of days since Julian Day 0, which began at noon UTC on January 1,
   4713 B.C. as reckoned on the Julian Calendar.  Yes, <em>noon</em> is the
   beginning of the day in the Julian Day system.)  So noon UTC on September
   10, 2001 is JD 2452163.0.
  </p>

  <p>
   Julian Day (JD) and Modified Julian Day (MJD) can also be parsed.  MJD is
   defined as Julian Day - 2400000.5.  Note that <em>midnight</em> is the start
   of a <em>Modified</em> Julian Day.
  </p>

  <p>
   Many astronomical calculations use Julian Day (Ephemeris), usually
   abbreviated JDE, which is Julian Day with reference to <a href="#DynamicalTime">Dynamical Time</a>, not Universal Coordinated Time
   (UTC).  This can be parsed using the prefix <code>JDE</code>:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code># JD 2452163.0 #</code></p>

  <p>
   You can also use the JDE function to convert a number to the corresponding

   <b>Note:</b> Do not confuse the Julian Day, (which is a single continuous
   numbering system often used by astronomers, who like the day number to
   change at noon when they&#39;re not working,) with a date in the Julian
   Calendar, which is almost identical to the Gregorian Calendar we use today,
   except without the centuries-divisible-by-400 leap-year rules.  (The
   differences are deeper, but that&#39;s the big one.)

  <h3><a name="DynamicalTime">Dynamical Time</a></h3>
  <p>
   Dynamical Time is a time system that adjusts for the varying rotation rate
   of the earth!  This is one of the most accurate time systems and is
   necessary for calculating astronomical events to high accuracy in the past,
   present, and future.
  </p>

  <p>
   The offset ΔT between UTC and Dynamical Time
   (that is, the time that must be <em>added</em> to UTC to get Dynamical
   Time) can be obtained by the function:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>deltaT[<i>date</i>]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You usually won&#39;t use this directly, but instead parse dates in Dynamical
   Time by appending the <code>TD</code> or <code>Dynamical Time</code>
   timezone specifiers when parsing a date.  The <code><a href="#OtherDateFormats">JDE</a></code> (Julian Date Ephemeris) format is
   also referenced to Dynamical Time.  For example, the time represented by
   the Dynamical Time at the year 2000 epoch is:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>epoch = # 2000-01-01 00:00 TD #</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Internally, all times are represented as the Julian Day referenced to UTC,
   but can be displayed in Dynamical Time if you specify Dynamical Time as the
   timezone on the right-hand-side of the conversion operator:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code># 2003-10-10 11:26 PM Mountain # -&gt; TD</code></p>

  <h3><a name="InternationalAtomicTime">International Atomic Time (TAI)</a></h3>
  <p>
   International Atomic Time (TAI) is a system of time based on the &#34;proper
   time&#34; on earth&#39;s geoid.  While dates and times in Frink are internally
   represented as a Julian day referenced to UTC, you can convert between UTC
   and TAI for any given date using the function
   <code>TAIMinusUTC[<i>date</i>]</code> which returns the value TAI-UTC.
   This is the cumulative number of leap seconds that have been introduced
   into the calendar.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>TAIMinusUTC[# 2008-12-01 00:00 UTC#]</code></p>

  <p>
   This facility allows you to adjust for leap seconds, as TAI does not use
   leap seconds, but UTC does.  For more information on handling leap seconds,
   read on.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="LeapSeconds">Leap Seconds</a></h3>
  <p>
   By default, Frink&#39;s date/time math (using the <code>+</code> and
   <code>-</code> operators)  does <em>not</em> correct for leap
   seconds, but it can track leap seconds when requested.  The following
   functions add and subtract dates, taking leap seconds into account:
  </p>

  <table summary="Leap Second Functions">
    <tbody><tr><th>Function</th><th>Description
    </th></tr><tr><td>addLeap[<i>date</i>, <i>offset</i>]</td><td>Adds the
      specified offset (given as a time) to the specified date, taking leap
      seconds into account.  This is equivalent to:
      <p>
       <code>date + offset + TAIMinusUTC[date] - TAIMinusUTC[date+offset]
       </code>
      </p>
       
    </td></tr><tr><td>subtractLeap[<i>date2</i>, <i>date1</i>]</td><td>Returns
      date2-date1 with leap seconds taken into account. (d2 is normally the
      later date.)  This returns a time interval between the dates. This is
      equivalent to: 
      <p>
       <code>date2 - date1 + TAIMinusUTC[date2] - TAIMinusUTC[date1]
       </code>
      </p>
  </td></tr></tbody></table>
  
  <p>
   For example, to find the exact time between two dates nominally a year
   apart:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    d1 = # 2008-12-01 00:00 UTC #</code>
   <code>365 days, 1 s</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that the duration is slightly longer due to the leap second being
   introduced at the end of 2008.
  </p>

  <p>
   Or, to add a specified duration to a date:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    addLeap[d1, 365 days] -&gt; UTC<br/>
   </code>
   <code>AD 2009-11-30 PM 11:59:59.000 (Mon) Coordinated Universal Time</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The functions <code>lengthOfYearLeap, lengthOfMonthLeap,
   lengthOfDayLeap</code> also calculate the length of years, months, days,
   etc.,
   <em>with leap seconds taken into account.</em>  See
   the <a href="#CalendarFunctions">Calendar Functions</a> section of the
   documentation for their use.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that the resulting time is one second earlier than without leap
   seconds, due to the leap second introduced at the end of 2008.  Note that
   the exact second of the resultant date/time value is undefined on the leap
   second boundary (which this calculation includes.)  Frink does <em>not</em>
   represent the leap second as something like <code>23:59:60.1</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   Modern leap seconds were first introduced on
   1972 January 1, where the value of TAI-UTC became exactly 10 seconds, and
   leap seconds have been introduced at irregular intervals since then.  Leap
   seconds may be added just before January 1 or July 1 of each year.
  </p>

  <p>
   It should be noted that from 1961 January 1 to 1972 January 1, instead of
   introducing discrete leap seconds, you had to do linear interpolation to
   convert between TAI and UTC.  <i>Be warned that Frink follows this
   interpolation process between these dates, and the value of UTC-TAI will
   not be an integer during this period!</i> Before 1961 Jan 1, this function
   returns 0 seconds.  For dates after the last known leap second is
   introduced, this function will return the value of TAI-UTC for the
   last-published leap second (<i>e.g.</i> 37 seconds after 2017-01-01.)
  </p>

   The <a href="#DynamicalTime"><code>deltaT[<i>date</i>]</code></a> and <a href="#InternationalAtomicTime"><code>TAIMinusUTC[<i>date</i>]</code></a>

  <h2><a name="RegularExpressions">Regular Expressions</a></h2>
  <p>
   Regular expressions allow you to match complex patterns in strings.  Frink
   matches most all of the regular expressions matched by Perl, and most
   regular expressions are portable between languages like Perl, Ruby, Python,
   Frink, etc.  Frink internally uses the OROMatcher regular expression
   library, which attempts to match as much of Perl 5&#39;s syntax as possible.
  </p>   

  <p>
   There is a quick <a href="#RegularExpressionReference">Regular Expression
    Reference</a> below which describes most of the features available.
  </p>

  <p>
   If a pattern matches, it returns an array (possibly empty) of all of the
   &#34;saved&#34; matches inside parentheses.  If a pattern does <em>not</em> match,
   it returns the value <code>undef</code>.  Since any array (even an empty
   named one) is treated as a <code>true</code> value, and <code>undef</code>
   is treated as <code>false</code> (see the <a href="#Truth">Truth</a>
   section of the documentation,) this makes it easy to test within an
   <code>if</code> statement:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
   for line = lines[&#34;https://frinklang.org/&#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   (Since a matched pattern always returns an array of values, putting
   <code>[email]</code> in square brackets assigns the result, as a single
   string, to the variable named <code>email</code>.  Without the brackets, it
   would assign <em>the whole array</em> to the variable <code>email</code>.)
  </p>

  <p>
   The matching syntax is similar to Perl or Ruby, with the exception that the
   pattern is denoted by <code>%r/<i>pattern</i>/<i>options</i></code> as
   below:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
   line = &#34;New Zealand&#34;</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   In the form listed above, no variable interpolation is done in the string.
   If you need to build up a variable regular expression from a string, use
   the <code>regex[<i>string</i>]</code> or <code>regex[<i>string</i>,
    <i>options</i>]</code> functions.  The sample below is identical to the
   sample above:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    line = &#34;New Zealand&#34;</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Any part of the pattern surrounded by parentheses are saved off and
   returned as an <em>array</em> (even if only one item is returned.)  There
   aren&#39;t shortcut <code>$1</code>... variables like in Perl, and probably
   never will be, as it&#39;s too easy to break code without knowing it.
  </p>

  <p>
   The usual idiom is to get return values by breaking apart the array that is
   returned:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
   line = &#34;My name is Inigo Montoya.&#34;</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If you don&#39;t assign the results to an array in square brackets (even a
   single-element array,) all matching results are assigned as an array to a
   single variable:

  </p><p>
   <code>
   line = &#34;My name is Inigo Montoya.&#34;</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If the <code>/g</code> modifier is used at the end of the pattern,
   (indicating return <em>all</em> times matched, not just the first,) this
   will return an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> of the items matched, and you should
   change the <code>if</code> statement to a <code>for</code> statement:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
   line = &#34;My name is Inigo Montoya.&#34;</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   See the <a href="#IteratingMatches">Iterating Matches</a> section of the
    documentation below for more ways to handle this case.

  <p>
   Repeating regular expression matches (those with the <code>/g</code>
   modifier) can be used in an enumerating context (<i>e.g.</i> in a
   <code>for</code> loop,) in which case each pass through the loop will
   return a match.  The following returns:
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>
   for [email] = read[&#34;https://frinklang.org/&#34;] =~ %r/(\w+@(?:\w|\.)+\.\w+)/g</code>

   <code>
    eliasen@mindspring.com</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   (The above URL contains the e-mail address twice.)  Note that pattern
   matches always return a <em>list</em> of values, (even if only one item is
   returned,) so to get only the first match, the variable <code>email</code>
   must be placed in square brackets.
  </p>

  <p>
   If used in a non-enumerating context (such as simple assignment,) the match
   will return a list-of-lists:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    list = read[&#34;http://futureboy.us/&#34;] =~ %r/(\w+@(?:\w|\.)+\.\w+)/g</code>
   <code>
    [[eliasen@mindspring.com], [eliasen@mindspring.com]]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This list can be flattened with the <code>flatten[<i>list</i>]</code>
   function:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    println[flatten[list]]<br/>
   </code>
   <code>
    [eliasen@mindspring.com, eliasen@mindspring.com]
   </code>
  </p>

  <h2><a name="SearchAndReplace">Search and Replace</a></h2>
  <p>
   A Perl-like search-and-replace operator also exists.  The syntax is:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>line =~
    %s/<i>pattern</i>/<i>replacement</i>/<i>opts</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If the expression on the left-hand-side of <code>=~</code> is assignable,
   it will be modified in-place.  The following fixes a spelling mistake:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    line =~ %s/Frank/Frink/g
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   In the form listed above, no variable interpolation is done in the
   <i>from</i> string.  If you need to build up a variable replacement
   expression from a string, use the <code>subst[<i>fromStr</i>,
   <i>toStr</i>]</code> or <code>subst[<i>fromStr</i>, <i>toStr</i>,
    <i>options</i>]</code> 
   functions.  Note that these <em>do not</em> actually perform the
   substitution, but create an object that can be used later to perform the
   substitution.  The sample below is identical to the sample above:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    fromStr = &#34;Frank&#34;</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can even use the Perl 5 behavior of replacing parenthesized parts of an
   expression.  The first parenthesized pattern on the left-hand side can be
   denoted by <code>$1</code> in the replacement, the second by
   <code>$2</code> and so on.  For example, to change a file with names like
   &#34;Frink, John&#34; to &#34;John Frink&#34;:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    line =~ %s/(\w+), (\w+)/$2 $1/
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can&#39;t use <code>$1</code> and <code>$2</code> outside of the pattern
   match, like you can in Perl, though.  Another difference from Perl is that
   the return value of a search-and-replace is the replaced string, and not
   the number of times replaced.  This may change.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="SubstitutionWithExpressions">Substitution with Expressions</a></h3>
  <p>
   If the <code>/e</code> modifier exists on a search-and-replace operation,
   the right-hand-side of the substitution is treated as an expression.  The
   values saved on the left-hand side in parentheses are put into the
   variables <code>$1</code> , <code>$2</code> , etc.  (<em>Note that these
   variables are only available in the right-hand side of the
   substitution!</em>)
  </p>

  <p>
   The following sample increments every integer it finds in the line.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    &#34;There are 3 lights.  My ship is the NCC-1701-D.&#34; =~ %s/(\d+)/eval[$1]+1/eg
   </code></p>

  <h2><a name="InputAndOutput">Input and Output</a></h2>

  <h3><a name="ReadingLines">Reading Lines</a></h3>
  <p>
   Frink has a useful file/URL input function called
   <code>lines[<i>URL</i>]</code> which reads lines one at a time from the
   specified URL or <code>java.io.InputStream</code>.  The URL can be an HTTP,
   file, or FTP URL.  It is best used with the <a href="#ForLoop"><code>for</code></a> loop.  For example, to fetch and
   display the contents of a web page:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
   for line = lines[&#34;https://frinklang.org/&#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   By default, the <code>lines[<i>URL</i>]</code> function returns an
   <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> which returns each line as requested, and forgets
   about previous lines.  If you want to store each line in an array for later
   use, use the <code>array[]</code> function:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = array[ lines[&#34;file:data/units.txt&#34;] ]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Hint:  You can use the <a href="#URLManipulation"><code>filenameToURL[<i>filename</i>]</code></a>
    function to turn a filename into a correctly-escaped URL, even if it has
    spaces or weird punctuation in it.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the first argument is the special string <code>&#34;-&#34;</code>, then the
   function will return an enumeration which reads lines from standard input
   (stdin) one at a time.  The following implements a simple &#34;echo&#34; program:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    for line = lines[&#34;-&#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Or, a simple program to read in and sort the lines from standard input, and
   print them back out:
  </p><p>
   
   <code>
    println[joinln[sort[lines[&#34;-&#34;]]]]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The argument to the function may also be a <code>java.io.InputStream</code>
   or a <code>java.io.Reader</code> which simplifies reading from other input
   streams (for example, reading from a <code>URLConnection</code> or an
   external process, or a pipe.)  See
   the <a href="#CompressingDecompressingFiles">Compressing/Decompressing
   Files</a> section of the documentation on how to use functions like
   <code>gunzip</code> to decompress files while reading them.
  </p>

  <p>
   See the <a href="#SpecifyingAlternateEncodings">Specifying Alternate
    Encodings</a> section of the documentation to see how to specify the
   encoding of the file.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="ReadingEntireFiles">Reading Entire Files</a></h3>
  <p>
   If you&#39;re carefree and have lots of memory, you can load the entire
   contents of an URL (again, file, HTTP, or FTP URL),
   a <code>java.io.Reader</code>, or a <code>java.io.InputStream</code>,
   a <code>java.io.File</code> or a <code>java.net.URL</code> into
   a single big honkin&#39; string using the <code>read[<i>source</i>]</code>
   function: 
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    bigstring = read[&#34;https://frinklang.org/&#34;]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code>read</code> function can also take
   a <code>java.io.Reader</code>, or a <code>java.io.InputStream</code>,
   a <code>java.io.File</code> or a <code>java.net.URL</code> as an
   argument.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   If the argument is a string, note that this function expects a URL, so to
   open a file, you must provide an absolute or relative file URL beginning
   with <code>file:</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    bigstring = read[&#34;file:///absolute/path/to/file&#34;]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    bigstring = read[&#34;file:relative.html&#34;]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Hint:  You can use the <a href="#URLManipulation"><code>filenameToURL[<i>filename</i>]</code></a>
    function to turn a filename into a correctly-escaped URL, even if it has
    spaces or weird punctuation in it.
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code>readLines[<i>source</i>]</code> functions will read the contents
   of an entire URL, <code>java.io.Reader</code>, or
   a <code>java.io.InputStream</code>, a <code>java.io.File</code> or
   a <code>java.net.URL</code> into an array with one line per entry.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = readLines[&#34;https://frinklang.org/&#34;]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that the same result could be achieved by calling
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    array[lines[&#34;https://frinklang.org/&#34;]]
   </code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Needless to say, this may use up large amounts of memory.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the string is the special value <code>&#34;-&#34;</code> these functions will
   read all the data passed to standard input (stdin) in one fell swoop.  For
   example, the following implements a simple &#34;echo&#34; program:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    println[read[&#34;-&#34;]]
   </code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The argument to the <code>read</code> and <code>readLines</code> functions
   may also be
   a <code>java.io.InputStream</code>, <code>java.io.Reader</code>, or
   a <code>java.io.File</code> or a <code>java.net.URL</code> which simplifies
   the manipulation of other input streams (for example, reading from
   a <code>URLConnection</code> or an external process, or a pipe.  See
   the <a href="#CompressingDecompressingFiles">Compressing/Decompressing
   Files</a> section of the documentation on how to use functions like
   <code>gunzip</code> to decompress files while reading them.
  </p>

  <p>
   See the next section for information about specifying the encoding of the
   file.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also read the contents of a URL (which may be a file) to an array
   of <code>byte</code> by calling <code>readBytes[<i>url</i>]</code>.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="SpecifyingAlternateEncodings">Specifying Alternate Encodings</a></h3>
  <p>
   The functions <code>lines</code> and <code>read</code>
   and <code>readLines</code> that take a URL
   or <code>java.io.InputStream</code> will attempt to set the character
   encoding correctly based on the
   <code>Content-Type</code> HTTP header.  If you are not requesting an HTTP
   URL, or the encoding is not properly specified, or not set in the HTTP
   headers, these functions will use your system&#39;s default character encoding.
   If the default charset is not appropriate for a file or URL, you can
   explicitly specify the character encoding of the file using the
   two-argument versions of the above functions:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>lines[<i>URL</i>, <i>encoding</i>]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The encoding is a string representing any character encoding that your
   version of Java supports, <i>e.g.</i> <code>&#34;UTF-8&#34;</code>,
   <code>&#34;US-ASCII&#34;</code>, <code>&#34;ISO-8859-1&#34;</code>, <code>&#34;UTF-16&#34;</code>,
   <code>&#34;UTF-16BE&#34;</code>, <code>&#34;UTF-16LE&#34;</code>.  Your release of Java may
   support more charsets, but all implementations of Java are required to
   support the above.  Check the release notes for your Java implementation to
   see if other charsets are supported.
  </p>

  <p>
   In addition, see the sample program  
   <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=encodings.frink">encodings.frink</a> which
   demonstrates how to list all of the encodings available on your system (and
   their aliases.)
  </p>

  <h2><a name="WritingFiles">Writing Files</a></h2>
  <p>
   Text files can be written with the <code>Writer</code> class.  For example:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    w = new Writer[&#34;filename.txt&#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code>Writer</code> class can write out any Unicode text properly in
   the encoding that you specify (or your system&#39;s default encoding, if you
   don&#39;t specify an encoding.)  You can also read in files in one encoding and
   translate them to another encoding.
  </p><p>
   For example, the following simple program reads in a file in the UTF-8
   encoding and writes it out in the UTF-16 encoding (or you can use it to
   convert between any encodings that your Java Virtual Machine supports):
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    w = new Writer[&#34;outfile.txt&#34;, &#34;UTF-16&#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   See <a href="#SpecifyingAlternateEncodings">Specifying Alternate Encodings</a>
   for information about supported encodings.

  <h3><a name="WriterConstructors">Writer Constructors</a></h3>
  <p>
   Note that calling any of the constructors below immediately checks
   permissions and opens the file if allowed.  Your operating system may only
   allow one process to open a file for writing at a time.
  </p>

      <code>Writer</code> that opens and will write to the specified filename
      using the specified encoding.  If the encoding is <code>undef</code>
      this will use the operating system&#39;s default encoding.
      <code>append</code> is a boolean value which is <code>true</code> if you
      want to append to the file, <code>false</code> to overwrite it if it
      exists.
      
    </td></tr><tr><td>new

       encoding.  <code>append</code> is a boolean value which is
       <code>true</code> if you want to append to the file, <code>false</code>
       to overwrite it if it exists. <code>bufferSize</code> is the size of
       the internal buffer to use in bytes, and must be greater than 0.
       
      </p><p>
       If you specify a buffer size, the file will not be automatically
       flushed after each <code>println</code> (which is the default
       behavior,) so you must remember to close or flush the file before it
       will all be written.  (This is to let you squeeze out a bit more
       performance.)  Note that if the program is interrupted or exits before
       you call the <code>close[]</code> method, your changes will not be
       guaranteed to be written!  If you use this constructor, it is
       recommended to wrap the code in a <a href="#TryFinally"><code>try/finally</code></a> block and call
       <code>close[]</code> in the <code>finally</code> block.
     </p>
      <p>

   For example, to write to a compressed file:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>file = &#34;compressed.txt.gz&#34;</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   And to read back the contents of the above compressed file:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>file = &#34;compressed.txt.gz&#34;</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Or, similarly,
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>for line = lines[gunzip[&#34;file:compressed.txt.gz&#34;]]</code>

  <p>
   These files can be read/written using standard <code>gzip</code> and

  <h3><a name="EmailHarvesting">E-mail Harvesting</a></h3>
  <p>
   The following sample uses <a href="#RegularExpressions">regular
    expression</a> matching to harvest things that look like e-mail addresses
   from any URL.  The combination of the <code>for</code> loop and the
   <code>/g</code> modifier allows multiple matches to be found in a single
   line.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    url = input[&#34;Enter a URL: &#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Pretty easy, eh?  Now you see why you get so much spam e-mail.  It&#39;s easy
   to grab e-mail addresses from files or Web pages.  Using this capability,
   Frink can be made to grab any kind of data from other web pages easily.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that pattern matches always return a <em>list</em> of values, (even if
   only one item is returned,) so to get only the first match, the variable
   <code>result</code> must be placed in square brackets.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="StrippingHTML">Stripping HTML</a></h3>
  <p>
   The following (ridiculously simple) function fetches the contents of any
   URL and (somewhat naïvely) strips out the HTML markup.

    stripHTML[url] := read[url] =~ %s/&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;//gs
   </code>
  </p>


  <h3><a name="URLManipulation">URL Manipulation</a></h3>
  <p>
   Frink provides a few functions which are useful for manipulating URLs and
   producing web-spiders:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>url[base, relative]</code> returns a new string URL
   made up of the given base and relative parts of a URL.  This is useful in
   resolving relative URLs in an HTML document:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>url[&#34;http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/index.html&#34;, &#34;whatsnew.html&#34;]</code></p>
  
  <p>
   <code>urlHost[url]</code> returns a string indicating the
   hostname of a specifed URL string (e.g. <code>&#34;futureboy.us&#34;</code>, or
   an empty string if no host is specified.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>urlPath[url]</code> returns a string indicating the
   entire path of a specifed URL string,
   (e.g. <code>&#34;http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/whatsnew.html&#34;</code> will 
   return <code>&#34;/frinkdocs/whatsnew.html&#34;</code>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>urlFile[url]</code> returns a string indicating the
   filename of a specifed URL string, that is the last path part of a URL
   (e.g. <code>&#34;http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/whatsnew.html&#34;</code> will
   return <code>&#34;whatsnew.html&#34;</code>)
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>URLEncode[<i>string, encoding=&#34;UTF8&#34;</i>]</code>
   encodes a string for use as part of a URL.  The encoding should probably be
   the string <code>&#34;UTF8&#34;</code> for most applications.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>URLDecode[<i>string, encoding=&#34;UTF8&#34;</i>]</code>
   decodes a string for use as part of a URL.  The encoding should probably be
   the string <code>&#34;UTF8&#34;</code> for most applications.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>urlProtocol[url]</code> returns a string indicating the
   protocol (e.g., <code>&#34;http&#34;</code> of a given URL string.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>filenameToURL[string]</code> turns a string containing
   a filename into a URL string.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>fileURLs[string]</code> takes a string representing a
   file or directory and returns an enumeration of files in that directory.
   Each string is the URL of a file in that directory.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>fileURLsRecursive[string]</code> takes a string
   representing a file or directory and returns an enumeration of files in that
   directory <em>and all its subdirectories.</em>  Each string is the URL of a
   file in that directory.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The following program resolves all of the relative URLs in an HTML
   document and prints their values.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    url = input[&#34;Enter a URL: &#34;]</code>
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="IOFunctions">I/O Functions</a></h3>

        the contents of one <code>java.io.InputStream</code> to
        a <code>java.io.OutputStream</code>.  This closes both streams when
        complete.   This is actually a quite fundamental operation.  For
        example, it is used by
        the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=ZipFile.frink">ZipFile.frink</a>

  <p>
   In Frink, you can define blocks of executable code which can be assigned to
   variables, passed to and from functions, and executed as functions.  These
   work just like functions with no name.  In fact, that&#39;s exactly what they
   are.  The syntax is:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>{ |<i>arglist</i>| <i>body</i> }</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    These can be multi-line functions, too:
  </p>

  <p>
    <code>{ |<i>x, y</i>|</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The arguments in <code>arglist</code> are a (possibly empty)
   comma-separated list of variable names which are treated just like the
   formal parameters to a function.  The body is one or more statements or
   expressions to be executed.
  </p>

  <p>
   How is this useful?  Well, for example the <a href="#select"><code>select</code></a> function can take an anonymous
   function as an argument to help it select items from a list.  See its
   documentation for more information.
  </p>

  <p>
   An anonymous function can be called as a function.  The current syntax looks
   just like a function call:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    isEven = { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 }</code>
   <code>true</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also apply an anonymous function with
   the <code>apply[<i>function</i>, <i>argList</i>]</code>
   function.  <code>argList</code> should be an array of arguments to the
   function.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    isEven = { |x|  x mod 2 == 0 }</code>
   <code>true</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   As of the 2025-02-08 release, an anonymous function can be declared and
   immediately applied to its arguments by enclosing them in square brackets
   after the declaration.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following defines an anonymous function that
   squares its argument and immediately applies it with the
   argument <code>10</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    {|x| x^2}[10]<br/>
   </code>
   <code>100</code>
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Sorting">Sorting</a></h2>
  <p>
   <code>sort[<i>list</i>]</code>will sort lists in which the elements have
   the same type.  When sorting units, the units should be conformal (that is,
   all should have the same dimensions.)  It is important to note that the
   list will be sorted in-place, that is, the original list will be modified!
   To get around this, the array should first be copied with the <a href="#ArrayMethods"><code><i>array</i>.shallowCopy[]</code> method.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b>  If you want to do language-correct sorting of strings,
   especially for languages with accents, use the <a href="#LexicalSorting">Lexical Sorting</a> methods instead.  The default
   <code>sort[]</code> is designed to be simple and fast, but does not sort
   human languages according to their rules.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a = [5,2,3,1,4]</code>
   <code>
    [1,2,3,4,5]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The two-argument version <code>sort[<i>list</i>, <i>func</i>]</code> allows
   you to specify a user-defined comparison routine. The second argument is a
   (possibly anonymous) function which contains a user-defined comparison
   routine.  The comparison routine must take 2 arguments
   (say <code>|a,b|</code>) and return -1 if a is less than b, 0 if a==b, and
   1 if a is greater than b.  (These are the values returned by
   the <a href="#ThreeWayComparison">three-way comparison</a>
   operator, <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> )  The argument <code>func</code> may also
   be an <code>Orderer</code>.
   The following samples are equivalent:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = [5,2,3,1,4]</code>
   <code>
    [1,2,3,4,5]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The default sort is much faster than if you define a user-defined
   comparison function (about 30 times faster in my tests!)  Now I see why
   Perl has so many anomalous and special-cased optimizations around
   user-defined sorting.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the <code>sort</code> function needs additional data to perform its
   work, you can use the three-argument <code>sort[<i>list</i>, <i>func</i>,
   <i>data</i>]</code> function which requires a three-argument comparison
   function to be passed to it, with the first two arguments being items to
   compare and the third argument being the arbitrary data.  The
   argument <code>func</code> may also be an <code>Orderer</code>.  For
   example, to sort a list by a specified column number:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    list = [[1, &#34;c&#34;], [2, &#34;b&#34;], [3, &#34;a&#34;]]</code>
   <code>[[3, a], [2, b], [1, c]]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If you always want to sort a multi-dimensional array by column number, you
   can get an appropriate sorting function that sorts by a specified column by
   calling <code>byColumn[<i>int</i>]</code> and passing that as a sorting
   function.  The column number is zero-based.  For example, the following
   simplifies the above example and sorts by column 1:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    list = [[1, &#34;c&#34;], [2, &#34;b&#34;], [3, &#34;a&#34;]]</code>
   <code>[[3, a], [2, b], [1, c]]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If you need to sort by several columns (that is, if the first column
   compares equal, then sort by column 2, etc, you can get an appropriate
   sorting function by calling <code>byColumns[<i>array of int</i>]</code> and
   passing that as a sorting function.  The column numbers are
   an <em>array</em> and are zero-based.  For example, the following sorts by
   column 0 and then by column 1.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    list = [[1, &#34;c&#34;], [2, &#34;b&#34;], [1, &#34;a&#34;], [3, &#34;d&#34;]]</code>
   <code>[[1, a], [1, c], [2, b], [3, d]]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   If you want the elements in reverse order, you can reverse the sorted list
   by calling the <code>reverse[<i>list</i>]</code> function on the sorted
   list.
  </p>

  <p>
   To sort all of the units with dimensions of time (or by extension, any
   dimension list) by their magnitude, you can use the following.  (Keep in
   mind that the <code>units</code> function returns the <em>names</em> of the
   units as strings.  The function <code>unit[<i>string</i>]</code> returns
   the unit with the specified name.:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    sort[units[time], { |a,b| unit[a] &lt;=&gt; unit[b] }]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Which is equivalent to:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    sort[unitsWithValues[time], byColumn[1]]
   </code>
  </p>

  <h3><a name="LexicalSorting">Lexical Sorting</a></h3>
  <p>
   The default <code>sort[]</code> functions sort strings in a simple and fast
   way (according to the order of characters in Unicode,) but in a way
   that is likely not correct according to the sorting methods for most human
   languages.  To sort strings correctly,
   <code>lexicalSort[<i>list</i>]</code> functions should be used.
  </p>

  <p>
   These functions understand alphabetization rules, Unicode normalization
   rules for characters with accents, alternate ways of specifying the same
   character, as well as the rules for most human languages and the way that
   their alphabetization rules differ.  They are very clever, and will make
   you look smart for using them correctly.
  </p>

  <p>
   The function <code>lexicalSort[<i>array</i>]</code> sorts an array of
   strings using the default language and locale settings defined in your Java
   Virtual Machine:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = [&#34;ökonomisch&#34;, &#34;offenbar&#34;, &#34;olfaktorisch&#34;, &#34;Arg&#34;, &#34;Ärgerlich&#34;, &#34;Arm&#34;, &#34;Assistent&#34;, &#34;Aßlar&#34;, &#34;Assoziation&#34;, &#34;eñe&#34;, &#34;ene&#34;, &#34;enne&#34;]</code>
   <code>
    [Arg, Ärgerlich, Arm, Assistent, Aßlar, Assoziation, ene, eñe, enne, offenbar, ökonomisch, olfaktorisch]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   (Note that this was using an English locale, which also has good default
   rules that work correctly for other languages.)  Compare this to the order
   produced by the basic sort, which doesn&#39;t know anything about special
   characters:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    sort[a]   <br/>
   </code>
   <code>
    [Arg, Arm, Assistent, Assoziation, Aßlar, ene, enne, eñe, offenbar, olfaktorisch, Ärgerlich, ökonomisch]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Which bears no resemblance to any alphabetical ordering that most human
   languages would expect.  The price is that lexical sorting is slower and
   more expensive.  But it&#39;s a small price for being right, and
   internationalization-capable.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that the sorting order depends on <em>your</em> Java Virtual Machine&#39;s
   locale and language settings.  If you want to force sorting for a
   particular language, you can use the <code>lexicalSort[<i>array</i>,
    <i>languageCode</i>]</code> function to specify its language code using
   the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php">ISO
    639-1</a> two-letter code for the language.  For example, repeating the
    above example for Turkish, whose language code is <code>&#34;tr&#34;</code>:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    lexicalSort[a, &#34;tr&#34;]   <br/>
   </code>
   <code>
    [Arg, Arm, Assistent, Assoziation, Aßlar, Ärgerlich, ene, eñe, enne, offenbar, olfaktorisch, ökonomisch]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   (Note that, according to the rules of Turkish, the letter
   <code>ä</code> is treated as a separate character alphabetized after
   <code>a</code>.  The same is true for <code>ö</code> and
   <code>o</code>.)
  </p>


  <p>
   Another example, using Danish and its possibly surprising alphabetization
   rules:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    a = [&#34;Ærø&#34;, &#34;Aalborg&#34;, &#34;Tårnby&#34;, &#34;Vejen&#34;, &#34;Thisted&#34;, &#34;Stevns&#34;, &#34;Sønderborg&#34;]
    </code>
   <code>
    [Stevns, Sønderborg, Thisted, Tårnby, Vejen, Ærø, Aalborg]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   That order is correct, with names beginning with &#34;Aa&#34; alphabetized last.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   If you need extreme control over the sorting order, the second argument of
   <code>lexicalSort[<i>list</i>, <i>languageCode</i>]</code> can be either a
   <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/Collator.html"><code>java.text.Collator</code></a>
   or a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Locale.html"><code>java.util.Locale</code></a>
   object which allows you very detailed control over creating custom sorting
   rules or locales.  Please see the documentation for those classes for
   details on controlling sorting.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also normalize strings containing Unicode characters into a
   &#34;canonical&#34; form.  See the <a href="#CorrectStringParsing"><code>normalizeUnicode[<i>str</i>]</code></a>
   function for more information about this.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the values to be sorted by the <code>lexicalSort</code> functions are
   not strings, they can still be sorted as long as they are comparable to
   each other.  The default sort order will be used when values are not
   strings.
  </p>

  <p>
   As of the 2024-07-11 release, <code>lexicalSort</code> now compares
   sub-arrays also.  For example, in an array of arrays, <code>[1,2,3]</code>
   sorts before <code>[2,1,3]</code>.  Shorter arrays sort before longer ones.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you need a lexical-aware comparison operator that compares two items,
   see the <a href="#CorrectStringParsing"><code>lexicalCompare[<i>str1</i>, <i>str2</i>]</code></a> functions.
  </p>

  <p>
   This is all pretty cool and powerful, right?  Your programs can now
   demonstrate knowledge about many, many human languages and do the right
   thing with them!
  </p>

  <h2><a name="ListComprehensions">List Comprehensions</a></h2>
  <p>
   The following functions operate on all the elements of an array:
  </p>

  <h3><a name="select">select</a></h3>
  <p>
   The <code>select[<i>list</i>,
   <i>proc</i>]</code> function allows you to select the items from a list for
   which <code>proc</code> returns <code>true</code>.  For example, to select
   the even items from a list:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]</code>
   <code>[0,2,4]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This successively assigns each element of <code>array</code> to a new
   local variable <code>x</code>, and returns the list of values for which
   <code>x mod 2</code> equals zero.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the function takes more than one argument, and is passed an array of
   values, the elements of the array are passed individually as function
   arguments.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following sample selects pairs of numbers which are coprime, that is,
   do <em>not</em> contain common factors (this is tested by checking if the
   greatest common factor is 1.):
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]</code>
   <code>[[2, 3], [20, 3], [7, 25]]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> The second argument to <code>select[<i>list</i>,
   <i>regex</i>]</code> can also be a regular expression.  This expects the
   list to contain all strings and returns all of the strings that match the
   regular expression.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> The second argument to <code>select[<i>list</i>,
    <i>substr</i>]</code> can also be a substring.  This expects the
   list to contain all strings and returns items which
   contain the specified substring (with an exact match.)  If you need a
   case-insensitive match, the second argument should be a regular expression.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the <code>select</code> function needs additional data to perform its
   work, you can use the three-argument <code>select[<i>list</i>, <i>func</i>,
   <i>data</i>]</code>
   function which requires a two-argument function to be passed to it, with
   the first argument being the item and the second argument the arbitrary
   data.  For example, to select all the elements of a list that are greater
   a certain number (in the following case, 2):
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]</code>
   <code>[3,4,5]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Similarly, the three-argument <code>select</code> function that passes in
   additional data will pass the data argument as the last argument to your
   selector function.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following example selects pairs whose product is larger than a specific
   number (in this case, 50).
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]</code>
   <code>[[20, 3], [7, 25]]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Behavior change:</b>  As of the 2014-05-09 release, the
   <code>select</code> and <code>remove</code> functions now try
   harder to keep their return values as arrays if passed an array, and an
   <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> if passed an
    enumerating expression.  In addition, they now keep dictionaries as
    dictionaries, <a href="#OrderedList">OrderedList</a>s as OrderedLists, and
    <a href="#Sets">sets</a> as sets.  To obtain other types, <code>toArray[<i>expr</i>]</code>,
    <code>toDict[<i>expr</i>]</code>, and <code>toSet[<i>expr</i>]</code>
    functions.  If in doubt, use these functions directly to change the return
    types.)
   However,closing the results in a <a href="#ForLoop"><code>for</code> loop</a> will still work to enumerate
   through all contained objects, no matter what the return type is.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
   This makes these functions now work properly with infinite series, and work
   more responsively with long-running operations that return information
   periodically. (<i>e.g.</i> searches.)  This change may also allow
   significantly-reduced memory consumption, as you can process each element
   and then forget about it, rather than holding on to a large array of
   values.
  </p>

  <p>
   The inverse of <code>select</code> is <code>remove</code>.  Read below.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="remove">remove</a></h3>
  <p>
   The inverse of the <code>select</code> function is <code>remove</code>
   which works similarly to <code>select</code>, but <em>removes</em> all
   items from a list that match the condition.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   The <code>remove[<i>list</i>,
   <i>proc</i>]</code> function allows you to remove the items from a list for
   which <code>proc</code> returns <code>true</code>.  For example, to remove
   the even items from a list:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]</code>
   <code>[1, 3, 5]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This successively assigns each element of <code>array</code> to a new
   local variable <code>x</code>, and removes all values for which
   <code>x mod 2</code> equals zero.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the function takes more than one argument, and is passed an array of
   values, the elements of the array are passed individually as function
   arguments.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following sample removes pairs of numbers which are coprime, that is,
   do <em>not</em> contain common factors (this is tested by checking if the
   greatest common factor is 1.):
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]</code>
   <code>[[5, 10]]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> The second argument to <code>remove[<i>list</i>,
   <i>regex</i>]</code> can also be a regular expression.  This expects the
   list to contain all strings and removes all of the strings that match the
   regular expression, returning the items that did <em>not</em> match.
  </p>

  <p>
   For example, if you wanted to remove all filenames that contained the
   substring <code>CVS</code> from a list, you might have to write a
   somewhat complicated, non-obvious regular expression that does not match
   that pattern using select: 
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>select[files,  %r/^(.(?!(CVS)))*$/]</code>
  </p><p>
   Or, more simply, use <code>remove</code> and a simpler pattern that matches
   the strings we want to remove:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>remove[files,  %r/CVS/]</code>
  </p><p>
   If the <code>remove</code> function needs additional data to perform its
   work, you can use the three-argument <code>remove[<i>list</i>, <i>func</i>,
   <i>data</i>]</code>
   function which requires a two-argument function to be passed to it, with
   the first argument being the item and the second argument the arbitrary
   data.  For example, to remove all the elements of a list that match a
   certain number (in the following case, 2):
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [0,1,2,3,4,5]</code>
   <code>[0,1,3,4,5]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Similarly, the three-argument <code>remove</code> function that passes in
   additional data will pass the data argument as the last argument to your
   selector function.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following example removes pairs whose product is larger than a specific
   number (in this case, 50).
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>
    array = [[2,3], [5,10], [20, 3], [7, 25]]</code>
   <code>[[2, 3], [5, 10]]</code>
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="map">map</a></h3>
  <p>
   The functions <code>map[<i>function</i>, <i>list</i>]</code>
   and <code>mapList[<i>function</i>, <i>list</i>]</code>
   and <code>mapList[<i>function</i>, <i>list</i>, <i>data</i>]</code> apply
   the specified function to all the members of a list, and returns a new list
   containing the results.  This is usually faster and more concise than
   applying a function to a list of arguments in a loop.
  </p><p>
   There are two different, but similar functions:  <code>map</code>
   and <code>mapList</code>.  Here is how to choose the function you want:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><code>map</code>: If you want to write a function that takes multiple
    arguments, <code>map</code> helps you by splitting an array of arguments
    into named variables for easy use in your function.

   </li><li><code>mapList</code>: If your function just wants to handle an array of
    values <em>as an array</em>, without modification,
    use <code>mapList</code>.  Normally, you provide a <em>one-argument</em>
    function that receives the array.  If you use the three-argument version
    <code>mapList[<i>function</i>, <i>list</i>, <i>data</i>]</code>, your
    function will have <em>two</em> arguments, <code>[list, data]</code>.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   The <code><i>function</i></code> parameter may be either a string
   containing the name of the function or a function, possibly an <a href="#AnonymousFunctions">anonymous function</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   If your list of arguments all have the same number of items, you can pass
   in the function name as a string:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [0,1,4,9]</code>
   <code>[0,1,2,3]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You may want to pass in a reference to the function itself as the first
   parameter.  You can do this by calling the <code>getFunction[<i>name</i>,
   <i>numArgs</i>]</code> function.  For example, to return the greatest
   common denominator of successive pairs of numbers, you might do the
   following:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [[3,5], [2,10], [24, 36]]</code>
   <code>[1,2,12]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Or, defining and using an <a href="#AnonymousFunctions">anonymous
    function</a>:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    array = [1,2,3]</code>
   <code>[2,4,6]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Anonymous arrays with any number of arguments are allowed, as long as each
   element of your list is a list containing the right number of items.
  </p>

  <p>
   Currently, all elements of the list must have the same number of elements
   and will resolve to the same function call.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>For the <code>map</code> function:</b></p>

  <p>
   <code>
    concat = {|i| join[&#34;&#34;, i]}</code>
   <code>[123, 456, 789]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   While this works in the above case, passing a one-argument array does not
   work correctly.  You need to use <code>mapList</code> in that case.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    concat = {|i| join[&#34;&#34;, i]}</code>
   <code>Error when calling function println:</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This is because the <code>map</code> function tries to &#34;break up&#34; the list
   and assign items from the list to named variables, and assigns any
   remaining items to the last variable of the function.  If you
   use <code>mapList</code> in this case, it works correctly.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    concat = {|i| join[&#34;&#34;, i]}</code>
   <code>[1, 45, 789]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can test what your function is receiving by replacing your function
   with something that just returns its value:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    echo = {|i| i}</code>
   <code>[1, [4, 5], [7, 8, 9]]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   As you can see, the first result <code>1</code> is not returned as an
   array.  Use <code>mapList</code> if you always want arrays handled as
   arrays, and not put into individual variables.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you need to pass additional data for the function to do its job, you can
   use the
   three-argument <code>mapList[<i>function</i>, <i>list</i>, <i>data</i>]</code>
   function.  The third argument, <code>data</code> is arbitrary data that
   will be passed to the second argument of <code>function</code> which must
   take two parameters, <code>[list, data]</code>.

  <p>
   The following returns <code>true</code> for all values that are greater
   than the threshold value passed in the variable <code>data</code>.

  <h3><a name="split">split</a></h3>
  <p>
   A string can be split into an array using the <code>split[<i>regex</i>,
   <i>str</i>]</code> function which splits the string into parts.  The first
   argument to the <code>split[<i>pat</i>, <i>str</i>]</code> function
   can be either a regular expression or a string containing the delimiter.
   Conversely, the elements of an array can be joined into a string with a
   fixed delimiter, using <code>join[<i>separator</i>, <i>array</i>]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Splitting a string into an array, splitting on whitespace (the pattern
   <code>\s+</code> matches 1 or more whitespace characters:)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = split[ %r/\s+/, &#34;1 2 3 4 5&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   Or, to split a tab-delimited line into elements:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>array = split[&#34;\t&#34;, line]</code></p>

  <p>
   A string can be split into lines on any newline characters
   (<code>\r\n|\r|\n|\u2028|\u2029|\u000B|\u000C|\u0085</code>) using
   the <code>splitLines[<i>str</i>]</code> function which returns an array of
   strings with the newlines removed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>line = &#34;One\nTwo\nThree&#34;</code></p>
  
  <h3><a name="join">join</a></h3>
  <p>
   The reverse of <code>split</code>
   is <code>join[<i>separator</i>, <i>array</i>]</code> which joins multiple
   array elements into one string, with elements separated by the specified
   string.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>join[&#34;:&#34;, array]</code></p>

  <p>
   The single-argument function <code>joinstr[<i>array</i>]</code> joins array
   elements with no separator.  This is equivalent
   to <code>join[&#34;&#34;, <i>array</i>]</code>
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="joinln">joinln</a></h3>
  <p>
   Returns a string where the elements of <code>array</code> are
   returned as a single string where the elements are separated by your
   platform&#39;s newline character(s).  That is, each element in the list are
   separated by newlines and probably printed on a line by itself.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>joinln[array]</code></p>

  <p>
   The inverse of <code>joinln[<i>array</i>]</code>
   is <code>splitLines[<i>string</i>]</code> which takes a string and splits
   the string on newlines.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="zip">zip</a></h3>
  <p>
   The function <code>zip[<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>]</code> &#34;zips&#34; together
   corresponding elements of lists <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> and
   returns each pair as a two-element array.  (This is what this function is
   usually called in functional programming, and has nothing to do with the
   zip compression format.)  For example:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>zip[1 to 3, 6 to 8]</code></p>

  <p>
   If one list is longer than the other, the shorter list will be
   padded with <code>undef</code> values.  If <em>both</em> arguments are
   <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expressions</a>, the result will be an efficient enumerating
   expression.  Otherwise, the arguments will be converted to arrays and the
   result will be an array (which is potentially large.)  Also note that an
   array <em>is</em> an <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a> too!
  </p>

  <p>
   The results can be processed individually with the <code>for</code> loop:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    for a = zip[1 to million, 3 to million + 3]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If you wish to pad with values other than <code>undef</code>, there is a
   4-argument version of the function <code>zip[<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>,
    <i>defaultA</i>, <i>defaultB</i>]</code> that specifies what values to pad
   each list with.
  </p>

  <p>
   The inverse of the <code>zip</code> function is
   the <a href="#unzip"><code>unzip</code></a> function below.
  </p>
   
  <h3><a name="unzip">unzip</a></h3>
  <p>
   The function <code>unzip[<i>expr</i>]</code> is the inverse of
   the <a href="#zip"><code>zip</code></a> function and &#34;unzips&#34; the columns
   of a given <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expression</a>
   (which can be an array) into seperate arrays and returns an array of
   arrays.  (This is what this function is usually called in functional
   programming, and has nothing to do with the zip compression format.)  (The
   return types are currently arrays, but this may change.)  For example, this
   inverts the list produced by the <code>zip</code> function above and
   separates it into two arrays called <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>a = [ [1,6], [2,7], [3,8] ]</code></p>
  
  <h2><a name="IncludingOtherFiles">Including Other Files</a></h2>
  <p>
   For ease of maintenance, you can separate your program code into multiple
   files and include them in other files.  This is accomplished by the
   <code>use</code> statement.  This includes the contents of the named file
   at compile-time, at the point where the <code>use</code> statement is
   encountered.  For example, to include a file called
   <code>sun.frink</code> in the current directory:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    use sun.frink
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code>use</code> statement searches for the named files in the
   following places:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>Relative to the root of the current classpath or jar file.
    
   </li><li>If the statement specifies a fully-qualified URL, the URL is loaded.
    This includes <code>file:</code>, <code>ftp:</code>, and
    <code>http:</code> URLs.
    
   </li><li>Relative to the current file or URL being parsed.
    
   </li><li>Relative to the current working directory.
    
   </li><li>Relative to all paths specified using the <a href="#CommandLineOptions"><code>-I <i>path</i></code> command-line
     option.</a>

   </li><li>From the internal &#34;standard library&#34; shipped within the jar file&#39;s
    <code>/stdlib</code> directory.  This location may change.
  </li></ol>

  <p>
   The <code>use</code> statement has protection against including a file
   multiple times.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Tip:</b> If you&#39;re including a file that&#39;s <em>not</em> relative to any
   of the above, you&#39;ll need to specify it using an <em>absolute</em>
   <code>file:</code> URL, such as:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>use file:///c:/prog/frink/samples/sun.frink</code></p>

  <p>
   This is necessary because a file or relative URL can legitimately contain
   colons on some operating systems.  For example, on a UNIX-like system, you
   could have a subdirectory called <code>c:</code> and that would be just
   fine.  Frink doesn&#39;t try to duplicate all the quirks of all operating
   systems and their wacky filename rules.
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="ObjectOrientedProgramming">Object-Oriented Programming</a></h2>
  <p>
   Frink allows you to write your programs in object-oriented fashion,
   allowing complex data structures that are still easy to use.  Inheritance
   is not implemented, (and many people may argue that it shouldn&#39;t be
   implemented) but works fine for programs that don&#39;t require inheritance.
  </p>

  <p>
   Classes are defined using the <code>class</code> keyword and a syntax that
   won&#39;t particularly surprise anyone who has worked with Java, C++, Ruby,
   Python, or other object-oriented languages.
  </p>

  <p>
   The format of a class and how to use it is demonstrated in the 
   <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=classtest.frink">classtest.frink</a>
   file.
  </p>

  <p>
   Interfaces are defined using the <code>interface</code> keyword, and is
   similar to Java&#39;s implementation.
  </p>

  <p>
   The format of an interface and how to use it is demonstrated in the 
   <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=interfacetest.frink">interfacetest.frink</a> file.
  </p>

  <p>
   Methods on an object can be listed using the
   <code>methods[<i>obj</i>]</code> function.  If <code>obj</code> is an
   instance of an object, this lists the instance-level <em>and</em>
   class-level methods of that object.  If called with a classname (that gives
   you the &#34;Metaclass Object&#34; for that class,) it displays just the
   class-level methods.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="TryFinally">Try / Finally</a></h2>
  <p>
   Frink has a <code>try/finally</code> block which allows the programmer to
   ensure that code is called no matter what happens in a block of code.  The
   code within the <code>finally</code> block is executed whether the block is
   exited from a <code>return</code> statement, or if an error occurs in the
   code, or whatever.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the body of the <code>try</code> or <code>finally</code> block is a
   single line, it can be written without curly braces.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    try</code>
  </p><h2><a name="Formatters">Formatters</a></h2>
  <p>
   Frink expressions can be formatted in a variety of formats.  There are
   currently different formatters for human-readable and machine-readable
   forms:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><code>outputForm</code>: The default, human-friendly output format.
   </li><li><code>inputForm</code>: A machine-readable format, suitable for passing
    to Frink as input, and parsing with the <a href="#SelfEvaluation"><code>eval[<i>str</i>]</code></a> function.  This lets you
   easily save and load most Frink data structures (and programs,) send them
    over a network, etc., in a simple, safe and reversible
    way.  <code>inputForm</code> converts all ASCII characters outside the
    ASCII range 32-127 into escape codes, making it safe for use in a 7-bit
    ASCII pipeline.
   </li><li><code>inputFormUnicode</code>: A machine-readable format, suitable for passing
    to Frink as input, and parsing with the <a href="#SelfEvaluation"><code>eval[<i>str</i>]</code></a> function.  This
    assumes that you have a working Unicode environment and does not escape
    non-ASCII characters like <code>inputForm</code> does.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   More formatters will follow, possibly for formatting into other languages
   (e.g. JavaScript/JSON).
  </p>

  <p>
   Several new functions have been added to support formatting in
   different formats:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><code>format[<i>expression</i>, <i>format</i>]</code> formats the
    expression to a string using the specified formatter.  Current formatters
    include the strings <code>&#34;Input&#34;</code>
    and <code>&#34;Output&#34;</code>.  <code>&#34;Input&#34;</code> is a formatter that
    provides Frink&#39;s input form that can be easily parsed by a call
    to <code>eval[<i>str</i>]</code>.  <code>&#34;Output&#34;</code> is the
    human-friendly formatter, which has been greatly improved for the
    introduction of multiple formatters.
    
   </li><li><code>formatters[]</code> lists the currently-available
    expression formatters.

   </li><li><code>inputForm[<i>expression</i>]</code>
    and <code>outputForm[<i>expression</i>]</code>
    and <code>inputFormUnicode[<i>expression</i>]</code> are aliases
    for <code>format[<i>expression</i>,&#34;Input&#34;]</code>
    and <code>format[<i>expression</i>,&#34;Output&#34;]</code>
    and <code>format[<i>expression</i>,&#34;UnicodeInput&#34;]</code> respectively.
    
   </li><li>Formatting options such as <code>showApproximations[]</code>,
    <code>rationalAsFloat[]</code>, <code>setEngineering[]</code>, and
    <code>showDimensionName[]</code> and the <code>:-&gt;</code> operator are
    now local to the <em>interpreter</em>, (and only affect the
    <code>&#34;Output&#34;</code> formatter,) not global to the entire Java Virtual
    Machine.  This makes it safer to embed multiple Frink parsers in a single
    virtual machine, each with their own preferences, and makes Java Server
    Pages more robust against poorly-behaved scripts.  (Programs still need
    to pass a security check to set these flags on an interpreter basis.)
  </li></ul>

  <h3><a name="InputForm">InputForm</a></h3>
  <p>
   The <code>inputForm[<i>expr</i>]</code> or <code>format[<i>expr</i>,
    &#34;Input&#34;]</code> function returns the expression in
   a machine-readable format, suitable for passing to Frink as input, and
   parsing with the <a href="#SelfEvaluation"><code>eval[<i>str</i>]</code></a>
   function.  This lets you easily save and load most Frink data structures
   (and programs,) send them over a network, etc., in a simple, safe and
   reversible way.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = new dict</code>  </p>

  <p>
   Notes on <code>inputForm</code>:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Currently, objects created from a <code>class</code> specification will
    be output as a <code>dict</code> with name-value pairs for all instance
    variables.  This may change.  This is currently done because there&#39;s no
    way to guarantee that the Frink interpreter on the other end has loaded
    the same <code>class</code> or a compatible version.  There are potential
    security and correctness issues if the classes are incompatible.  A
    malicious user could also modify the data to get around security or logic
    checks and create invalid or dangerous objects.  It&#39;s currently left up to
    the programmer to take these objects, validate their fields, and turn them
    back into the objects they want on the other end.  This may change.
    
   </li><li>The Julian day parser can now parse rational numbers or date
    intervals, for example:
    <ul>
     <li><b>Rational:</b> <code># JD 212263942857555001/86400000000 #</code>
     </li><li><b>Interval:</b> <code># JD [212263942933679/86400000, 70754647644893/28800000] #</code>
    </li></ul>

   </li><li>Java objects are not currently formatted usefully.  This may change,
    or not.
    
   </li><li>When outputting dates in &#34;input form&#34;, the date will be formatted as
    an exact Julian day (possibly an interval or an exact rational number as
    above) if necessary, or in a human-readable format in UTC, if
    sub-millisecond precision is not required, which allows exact round-trips
    of dates.

   </li><li>Strings and identifiers (e.g. variable names, function names) will be
    encoded into an ASCII-safe form.  Characters outside the ASCII range will
    be escaped into ASCII-safe Unicode escapes.  If you have a Unicode-safe
    environment and want to preserve Unicode unmodified, use
    the <a href="#InputFormUnicode">inputFormUnicode</a> formatter instead.

   </li><li>Added <code>toASCII[<i>str</i>]</code> function to turn a string into
    a network and file-encoding safe ASCII-encoded equivalent.  This is
    useful if you don&#39;t want the full quoting of <code>inputForm</code>.

   </li><li>Formatting options such as <code>showApproximations[]</code>,
    <code>rationalAsFloat[]</code>, <code>setEngineering[]</code>, and
    <code>showDimensionName[]</code> and the <code>:-&gt;</code> operator 
    do not apply in <code>inputForm</code>.
  </li></ul>

  <h3><a name="InputFormUnicode">InputFormUnicode</a></h3>
  <p>
   The <code>inputFormUnicode[<i>expr</i>]</code> or <code>format[<i>expr</i>,
    &#34;UnicodeInput&#34;]</code> function returns the expression in
   a machine-readable format, suitable for passing to Frink as input, and
   parsing with the <a href="#SelfEvaluation"><code>eval[<i>str</i>]</code></a>
   function.
  </p>

  <p>
   Unlike the <code>inputForm</code> formatter described above, it
   does <em>not</em> escape Unicode characters outside the ASCII 32-127 range
   into escape codes.  It assumes that you have a working Unicode
   environment that will not be corrupted by intermediate tools.  For safety
   in other environments, use the <code>inputForm</code> formatter instead.
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="Graphics">Graphics</a></h2>
  <p>
   Frink has a powerful system for drawing graphics in a simple way.  Here are
   some of the features:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li><b>Flexible coordinate system:</b> You can draw your graphics to any
    coordinates you wish, and Frink will, by default, automatically scale and
    center them in your display device, eliminating the tedium and error of
    manual coordinate conversions, adjustment for different window or printer
    sizes, etc.

   </li><li><b>Dimensioned drawings:</b>  Graphics can be specified with explicit
    lengths (such as &#34;3 cm&#34;,) so exactly-sized drawings can be printed.
    (Well, as accurately as your printer&#39;s driver allows them to be!)

   </li><li><b>Infinitely scalable:</b> Frink&#39;s graphics are primarily designed to
    work with shapes, not individual pixels, so they can be re-scaled perfectly
    to display with full resolution on printers, in resizable graphics
    windows, in image files, or in rescalable vector formats.
    
   </li><li><b>High-quality shapes:</b>  Polygons and polylines are drawn with
    properly-joined, angled corners.

   </li><li><b>Anti-Aliasing:</b> Lines and shapes are anti-aliased, eliminating
    jagged edges.  (When running under Java 1.2 or later.  Frink&#39;s graphics
    will also run on Java 1.1, but without antialiased edges.)  Aliasing can
    now be controlled through the <a href="#Antialiasing">Antialiasing</a>
    methods.

   </li><li><b>Transparency (alpha channel):</b> Allows transparent shapes and
    lines, and see-through shapes to be drawn on top of other shapes.
    Anti-aliased edges are drawn with proper transparency so they can be
    overlaid on any background color or image.  (Requires Java 1.2 or later for
    transparency.)

   </li><li><b>High-quality text:</b>  Text can be written into any graphics
    object, with properly transparent anti-aliased edges.  Text may be scaled
    along with the image, or rendered at a constant size.

   </li><li><b>Easy transformations:</b>  All graphics can be translated, scaled,
    and rotated, making it very easy to draw objects to the coordinate system
    that is easiest to use, and translating it into larger drawings.  When
    graphics are scaled and rotated, Frink is smart enough to keep what you&#39;ve
    drawn centered and scaled to fit on the screen or printed page!

   </li><li><b>Easy writing to files:</b> Graphics can be easily written to various
    file formats, including JPEG, PNG, HTML5 canvas, and Scalable Vector
    Graphics (SVG and SVGZ) formats.  PNG supports transparency (alpha channel)
    and allows antialiased, semi-transparent lines and shapes to be overlaid
    over other backgrounds or layers.  SVG format allows infinite rescaling and
    perfect rendering to high-resolution devices such as printers, and perfect
    import into other vector graphics programs.

   </li><li><b>Easy display on different devices:</b> The same graphics object
    can be created and then displayed on screen, printed to a printer, or
    written to a file, using a single command.
  </li></ul>

  <h3><a name="IntroductionToGraphics">Introduction to Graphics</a></h3>
  <p>
   Graphics are drawn and displayed in three steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>Create an object of type <code>graphics</code>:
    <p>
     <code>g = new graphics</code>
    </p>
    
   </li><li>Draw your shapes into the <code>graphics</code> object:
    <p>
     <code>
      g.line[1,100,100,1]</code>
    </p>

   </li><li>Show (or print, or write your image to a file):
    <p>
     <code>
      g.show[]
     </code>
    </p>

    <p>
     <img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/images/graphicsintro.png" width="400" height="300" alt="Graphics Introduction"/>
    </p>
  </li></ol>

  <p>
   That&#39;s it.  Frink takes care of the scaling and centering by default.  The
   coordinates that you choose can be whatever is most convenient and natural
   for you.  You can also create as many <code>graphics</code> objects as you
   want.  By default, when you call <code><i>graphics</i>.show[]</code>, each
   graphics object is displayed in its own resizable window. 
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Coordinates">Coordinates</a></h3>
  <p>
   Coordinates in Frink&#39;s graphics are very flexible.  There are a few things
   to note:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Coordinates are specified as (x, y) with <code>x</code> being the
    horizontal coordinate and <code>y</code> the vertical coordinate.

   </li><li>Horizontal coordinates increase as you move right.

   </li><li>Vertical coordinates increase as you move down.  (Note that this is the
    common convention for almost all computer graphics, but is different than
    the usual mathematical conventions.  You can change this using a <a href="#TransformingGraphics">Graphics Transformation</a>, but be warned
    that will vertically flip text as well.)

   </li><li><b>Arbitrary-sized coordinates:</b>  Coordinates can be as big or small
    as you want.  Any real number that Frink can represent is fine.

   </li><li><b>Automatic centering and scaling:</b> You don&#39;t need to worry about
    the size or location of your rendering window.  By default, all graphics
    are resized and centered to fit into your graphics device (whether it&#39;s a
    resizable window, a printed page, or a graphic file.)  This saves lots of
    time and effort when drawing most graphics.  Even if your graphics have
    been scaled, translated, and rotated, Frink will still ensure that what
    you&#39;ve drawn is scaled and centered.

   </li><li><b>Aspect ratio:</b> Aspect ratio is preserved by default.  That is, if
    a rectangle is 2 units wide and 1 unit high, it will retain that shape on
    resizing.  (You can change that by multiplying all coordinates on one axis
    by a &#34;dummy&#34; dimension that isn&#39;t dimensionless and isn&#39;t a length.)

   </li><li><b>Accurately-scaled drawings</b>: Coordinates may have dimensions of
    length (e.g. &#34;1 inch&#34;), in which case they are treated specially.  In this
    case, the graphics are still translated to fit into your view window, but
    Frink will also attempt to render them at the specified size.  This is
    highly dependent on how your operating system reports its resolution.  It
    works very well for printers, but not as well for monitors (especially in
    Windows, which almost always reports its screen resolution as 96 dpi, no
    matter what it really is.)  This allows you to print exact-sized drawings
    to the accuracy allowed by your operating system and printer drivers.  See
    the notes below about dimensions.

   </li><li><b>Dimensions with units:</b> Including the special case for length,
    all coordinates can have any units of measure, <em>as long as all
     coordinates along the same axis have the same dimensions</em>.  However,
    both axes do <em>not</em> have to have the same dimensions as each other,
    and will be scaled to fit in the window (because preserving aspect ratio is
    meaningless if they don&#39;t have the same units.)
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   For example, the following short program prints graph paper with a 1 mm
   grating:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
g= new graphics</code>
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="ShapesAndColors">Shapes and Colors</a></h3>
  <p>
   All of Frink&#39;s graphics are built out of a small number of basic shapes.
   These are drawn into a <code>graphics</code> object using the methods
   outlined below.  For example, you use them like the following:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    g = new graphics</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/images/circle.png" width="300" height="200" alt="Sample Circle"/>
  </p>

  <p>
   A new <code>color</code> object can also be obtained by calling <code>new
   color[<i>r, g, b, alpha</i>]</code> or <code>new color[<i>r, g,
   b</i>]</code>.  Note that <em>creating the color this way does not set the
   color in any graphics object.</em>  That must be done separately with a
   call to <code><i>graphics</i>.color[<i>c</i>]</code>.
  </p>

  <table summary="Graphics Shape and Color Methods">
    <tbody><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description
    </th></tr><tr><td>color[<i>r, g, b</i>]</td><td>Sets the current
      drawing color.  All following drawings will be made using this color.
      The color is specified with its red, green, and blue
      components which are floating-point values which must range from 0.0 to
      1.0, with 0.0 being completely dark for that component, and 1.0 being
      the brightest value for that component.  In a new graphics object, the
      default drawing color is black.  This also returns the color object so
      you can later re-use it in a <code>color[<i>c</i>]</code> method call.

    </td></tr><tr><td>color[<i>r, g, b, alpha</i>]</td><td>Also specifies a
      color, but with transparency.  The <code>alpha</code> component

      <code>backgroundColor</code> method call in a <code>graphics</code>
      object, and it should be the first method called when drawing.  If more
      than one call to <code>backgroundColor</code> is made, this will raise a
      warning.  (It will also replace any existing background color, but that
      behavior should not be relied on.)  By default, the background color is
      opaque white (or transparent when writing formats like SVG.)

      transparency can already be specified when setting colors.  If a color

  <p>
   Drawing a curve or a polygon out of <code>line</code> primitives might not
   give good results, as the lines don&#39;t know that they&#39;re supposed to be
   connected to each other.  To solve this problem, Frink has 
   <code>polyline</code>, <code>polygon</code> and <code>filledPolygon</code>
   objects which produce high-quality, connected lines with properly-joined
   corners.  Drawing a polygon or polyline to a graphics object consists of a
   few steps:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>Create the graphics object (if you haven&#39;t done so already.)
    <p>
     <code>g = new graphics</code>
    </p>

   </li><li>Create a polygon, filled polygon, <em>or</em> polyline.  (The sample
    below shows all three.  Pick one.)
    <p>
     <code>p = new polygon</code></p>

    <p>
     Alternately, you can pass in a list of points to any of the above
     constructors, in which case you can skip the next &#34;adding points&#34; step.
    </p>

    <p>
     <code>
      a = [ [1,3], [7,4], [6,2] ]</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     Alternately, you can copy a polygon type to another polygon using the copy
     constructors:
    </p>

    <p>
     <code>
      a = [ [1,3], [7,4], [6,2] ]</code>
    </p>
     
   </li><li>Add an arbitrary number of points to the line or polygon using its
    <code>addPoint</code> method.  Each point represents a vertex in the
    polyline or polygon.
    <p>
     <code>
      p.addPoint[<i>x,y</i>]</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     Note that a <code>polygon</code> or <code>filledPolygon</code> is
     <em>automatically closed</em>.  You should <em>not</em> manually connect
     the last point back to the first by repeating it at the end of the list.
     You should only have as many <code>addPoint</code> calls as there are
     vertices in your polygon.
    </p>

   </li><li>Add the polygon to the graphics object.  A polygon can be added to
    multiple graphics objects.  The drawing color and stroke width used in
    rendering the polygon are the ones which are active at the time of the
    <code>.add</code> call.  <em>Note that no points should be added to the
     polygon after it is added to the graphics object!</em>
    <p>
     <code>g.add[p]</code>
    </p>
    
   </li><li>Show the graphics object (or print, or save it to a file, or keep
    drawing into it and show it later...)

  <h4><a name="GeneralPath">GeneralPath</a></h4>
  <p>
   A <code>GeneralPath</code> allows you to create complex shapes consisting
   of straight lines, quadratic and cubic Bézier curves, arcs, and
   ellipses.  These paths can be filled or outlines, and can have multiple
   sub-paths that represent the &#34;inside&#34; and &#34;outside&#34; of an object.  For
   example, rendering a filled letter <code>P</code> in which one can see
   through the &#34;hole&#34; in the P can be obtained with a GeneralPath, and is not
   possible with a <code>polygon</code>.
  </p>

  <p><em>Note:</em> The GeneralPath functionality is only available under
   Java 1.2 and later.  Attempting to draw with a GeneralPath in earlier
   releases will produce a warning and the GeneralPath will not be drawn.

      render text.  The arguments are:
      <ul>
       <li><code><b>fontName</b></code>:  A string indicating the name of the
        font family.  For portability to all platforms and image types
        (including SVG files,) this should be one of <code>&#34;Serif&#34;, &#34;SansSerif&#34;, &#34;Monospaced&#34;</code>.  However,
        any font name available on your system may be used if you don&#39;t care
        about portability.
        
       </li><li><code><b>style</b></code>:  An string containing information about
        the font style.  This should contain one of <code>&#34;plain&#34;, &#34;bold&#34;, &#34;italic&#34;, &#34;bold+italic&#34;</code>.  (It&#39;s
        actually a case-insensitive substring search that just looks for
        &#34;bold&#34; and &#34;italic&#34; so this can be written in a lot of ways.) 
        
       </li><li><code><b>height</b></code>: The height of the font in the current
        coordinate system.  Height is taken as the distance from standard
        baseline to the next standard baseline, not necessarily as the height
        of the tallest characters.  This fits the usual definition of font size
        used in most systems.

        <p>
         If the height is a dimensionless number, (e.g. <code>10</code>) the font will be scaled
         along with the drawing.  If the height has units of length,
         (e.g. <code>10 points</code> or <code>1
          cm</code>) the font will be rendered at that constant height,
         regardless of how the image is scaled.  Note that using a height with
         dimensions of length might force the text out of the viewable area if
         the drawing is scaled too small to accommodate it.
        </p>
      </li></ul>

      <p>
       If you don&#39;t specify a font before drawing text, your system will use
       its default font, which may give different results when the same
       program is run on different systems or rendered to different devices.
       This behavior may change to specify a fixed default font in the future.

   A <code>graphics</code> object can be built up from multiple

   added at their original size, or placed at a certain location and size.
   This makes it easy to create complex graphics from many different graphics

   Frink allows you to rotate, translate, and scale graphics objects, allowing
   you to write simple code using the coordinate system that is most logical,
   and translate or scale it wherever you want.  Like all of Frink&#39;s other
   graphics, Frink ensures that whatever you draw is automatically scaled and
   centered into the display, and can be exported to various file formats.
  </p>

  <p>
   The current graphics transformation can be saved with a call to
   <code><i>graphics</i>.saveTransform[]</code> and should be restored with a
   corresponding call to <code><i>graphics</i>.restoreTransform[]</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following methods are available on a <code>graphics</code> object to
   transform the coordinates.  Each transform is appended to the previous
   transforms.  After making a transformation, all subsequent drawing or
   <code>add[]</code> commands will use the current transform.

  <h3><a name="ClippingGraphics">Clipping Graphics</a></h3>
  <p>
   To constrain the area in which graphics can be drawn, you can specify a
   clipping region on a <code>graphics</code> object.  <em>After</em> you set
   a clipping region, subsequent drawing commands will only be drawn within
   that region.
  </p>

  <p>
   A cool thing about the clipping implementation is that, like all of Frink&#39;s
   graphics, you can draw to any coordinate system that makes sense to you,
   even if it&#39;s rotated, scaled, skewed, and clipped, and Frink will
   automatically center and scale that into your graphics window by default,
   greatly simplifying many graphics programming tasks.  In other words,
   clipping can be used to &#34;zoom in&#34; on a section of a larger graphic--just
   set a clipping region before drawing the graphic and only the section
   within the clipping region will be displayed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Each time you add a clipping boundary, it <em>narrows</em> the existing
   clipping boundary, and the clipping boundary will become the intersection
   of the previous clipping boundary and the new clipping boundary.
  </p>

  <p>
   Clipping boundaries can be saved and restored with the
   <code><i>graphics</i>.saveClip[]</code> and
   <code><i>graphics</i>.restoreClip[]</code> methods.  Currently, these
   must be properly nested with
   <code><i>graphics</i>.saveTransform[]</code> and
   <code><i>graphics</i>.restoreTransform[]</code> calls.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following methods are on a <code>graphics</code> object.
  </p>

      boundary, always making the clipping boundary smaller.)

  <h3><a name="ConstrainingViewport">Constraining Viewport</a></h3>
  <p>
   By default, Frink&#39;s graphics are automatically scaled and centered in the
   display.  All of the graphics that you draw will automatically be visible,
   no matter what coordinate system you use.  However, sometimes you may want
   to have fine-grained control over the region that is displayed, even if you
   don&#39;t fill it entirely, or if you want to draw outside the region, or if
   you want to &#34;zoom in&#34; on just part of a graphic.
  </p>
   
  <p>
   If you want to constrain the viewport of a graphics object, you can do so
   by drawing a transparent rectangle (or other shape) to set the minimum
   size, and by clipping to a rectangle (or other shape) to set the maximum
   size.  This is intentionally somewhat vague because Frink&#39;s graphics
   operations allow for a wide variety of viewport settings with many shapes.
  </p>

  <p>
   For example, to set the viewport to a rectangle, do something like the
   following with your <code>graphics</code> object <em>before</em> drawing to
   it:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    g = new graphics[]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also clip to other shapes, such as circles, ellipses,
   polygons, <code>GeneralPath</code>, etc.  You can also use other
   convenience methods such
   as <code>fillRectSize</code>, <code>fillRectCenter</code>, <code>clipRectSize</code>, <code>clipRectCenter</code>,
   etc., if they are more convenient.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Antialiasing">Antialiasing</a></h3>
  <p>
   By default, graphics and text are antialiased on most platforms.  That is,
   edges of lines and text are smoothed and slightly blurred to reduce jagged
   edges.  This may be unwelcome in some situations, such as when drawing many
   adjacent rectangles.  Antialiasing of graphics and text can be controlled
   by the following methods on a <code>graphics</code> object.

  <table summary="Antialiasing Methods">
    <tbody><tr><th>Method</th><th>Description </th></tr><tr><td>antialiased[<i>boolean</i>]</td><td>If set to <code>false</code>,
      all subsequent shape drawing operations to that <code>graphics</code>
      object will no longer be anti-aliased.  (Note that this does not affect
      anti-aliasing of text, which is controlled separately by the
      <code>antialiasedText</code> function below.)  This may be turned on and
      off over the course of drawing a single <code>graphics</code> object.

      with a transparent background, allowing you to stack and create
      composite images with full anti-aliasing and background support.

      <p>If exactly one of <code>width</code> or <code>height</code> are
       specified as <code>undef</code>, and the other is an integer, the size

      </p>

      <p>
       In the versions of these functions where <code>insets</code> is
       specified, the value of that argument indicates how wide a border
       should be left when drawing.  When specifying <code>1</code> (indicating
       100%) to the <code>insets</code> argument, the drawn image occupies
       100% of the width and height, with no border.  By default, only 95%
       (0.95) of the width or height is used, leaving a small 5% border around
       the drawn graphics.  Specifying the insets is important when rendering
       image files out at their original size.  See the <a href="#Images">Images</a> section of the documentation for more.

        of Java.  <em>Warning:</em>  Due to a deficiency in the SVG standard,
        drawings with dimensions of length (e.g. &#34;1 inch&#34;) may not work
        properly for some shapes, notably polygons, polylines, and GeneralPath.
       </li><li><b>SVGZ</b>: (Scalable Vector Graphics, compressed with GZIP)  This
        is the same as the SVG format, but is compressed with the GZIP
        compression algorithm.  Since SVG files usually contain a lot of
        repetition, using this format will significantly reduce file size and
        should be parseable by most/all programs that can handle SVG files.
       </li><li><a name="html5"><b>HTML</b></a>: (HTML5 canvas support required)
        While HTML5 will not be a finalized specification until at least 2014,
        major modern browsers for desktop and mobile devices (Firefox, Chrome,
        Opera, Safari, IE) support the HTML5 features that Frink requires.
        <ul>
         <li>Transmission of vector graphics in vector formats, allowing
          efficient, antialiased rendering of vector graphics.

         </li><li>Bitmapped images are transmitted within the HTML document as
          embedded <code>data</code> URIs encoded in base-64, allowing you to
          send the entire graphic as a single HTML file.  Bitmapped images are
          transmitted at the end of the file, and displayed as they are loaded,
          allowing progressive display of documents containing multiple
          bitmaps.

         </li><li>All of Frink&#39;s graphics primitives are supported, including
          bitmaps, <code>GeneralPath</code>, partially-transparent graphics,
          rotations, translations, and scaling.

         </li><li>HTML5 is rendered to relatively simple, user-modifiable code.

         </li><li><i>What doesn&#39;t work in HTML5 (future wish list):</i>
          <ul>
           <li>Drawings with dimensions (<i>e.g.</i> a rectangle with width
            <code>1 inch</code>) does not get rendered properly to HTML5.  I&#39;m
            still doing research to see if we can get a reasonable resolution
            figure from the rendering environment.
            
           </li><li>HTML5, for some ungodly reason, for a long time did not not
            support the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even-odd_rule">even-odd
             winding rule</a> for filling graphics, which becomes important
            when drawing an arbitrary <code>GeneralPath</code> and
            self-intersecting or concentric filled polygons.  HTML5 only
            supported the rather stupid and useless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero-rule" target="_blank">nonzero winding rule</a> which will make some 
            objects with &#34;hollow&#34; centers not render the same in HTML5 as they
            do in all other sane environments (e.g. Swing, AWT, Android, SVG,
            PostScript, PDF).
            
            <p>
             However, this problem is being gradually addressed in current
             browsers, (but not yet in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/#fill-and-stroke-styles">official HTML5 Canvas spec</a>!) but your browser
             needs to support the HTML 
             Canvas&#39;s <code>context.fill(&#34;evenodd&#34;)</code> method for Frink&#39;s
             graphics to work properly now.  This appears to be supported in
             current versions of Firefox (21+), Firefox on Android, Chrome
             (27+), Opera (15+), Safari 8.0, and IE11 (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ff975415%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">according to this</a>).

           </p></li><li>Animation is not yet possible in HTML5.  It&#39;s not clear if this
            will be easy without porting all of Frink to JavaScript.

           </li><li>All bitmapped graphics are embedded in PNG format.  These may
           be larger than the corresponding JPEG graphics, but they are
           lossless and allow alpha channels, which JPEG does not allow.  It&#39;s
           possible that there may be a switch in the future to embed bitmaps
           in JPEG format and to control the quality, or the renderer may get
           &#34;smarter&#34; and determine if alpha channels are present, and switch
           rendering formats for efficiency.

           </li><li>When rendering just a portion of a bitmapped image to HTML5,
           the entire original bitmap file is transmitted in the HTML5
           document.

           </li><li>If the browser doesn&#39;t support the HTML5 <code>canvas</code>
           element, Frink could theoretically render a small thumbnail image
           (or full-resolution image, but that would be wasteful) showing the
           user what they&#39;re missing.  If the browser doesn&#39;t support
           <code>canvas</code>, the user is warned about possibly needing to
            open the document in a newer browser.

  <p>
   Bitmap images can be loaded and drawn to a graphics object, displayed in
   their own window, resized, printed (including tiled across several pages,)
   drawn over, saved out to files, etc.  You can also load an image or create
   it in memory, and read or write the values of individual pixels, allowing
   image processing or analysis.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <em>Note that Java 1.1 and earlier did not have a portable, public way to
     read and write individial pixels of images, so many of these methods
     require Java 1.2 or later.</em>
  </p>

  <p>
   To load an image, call <code>new image[<i>URL</i>]</code>, passing it a
   URL.  The URL can be of any type your Java platform understands, including a
   <code>file:</code> URL indicating a file on your local system:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    img1 = new image[&#34;http://futureboy.us/images/futureboydomethumb4.gif&#34;]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   An image can also be loaded from a Java object that contains an
   already-opened <code>java.io.InputStream</code>: <code>new
   image[<i>java.io.InputStream</i>]</code>.  This allows you to create images
   from open files, URLs, network sources, servlet containers, in-memory
   sources, etc., without writing their data to temporary files.
  </p>

  <p>
    To create a new (blank) image, specify the width and height in pixels:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    img3 = new image[640, 480]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   To copy an image, use the copy constructor:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    img4 = new image[img3]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This will make a copy of all of the pixels in the image, so the copy can be
   modified without modifying the original.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can turn a <code>graphics</code> object into a bitmapped image in
   memory by using the method:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    <i>graphics</i>.toImage[<i>width</i>, <i>height</i>]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   or the <code>image</code> constructor:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    new image[<i>graphics</i>, <i>width</i>, <i>height</i>]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   In both of the above functions, both <code>width</code>
   and <code>height</code> are dimensionless integers, or, if exactly one
   of <code>width</code> or <code>height</code> are specified
   as <code>undef</code>, and the other is an integer, the size of the
   undefined axis will be calculated from the defined width or height and the
   aspect ratio of the <code>graphics</code> that is being drawn.
  </p>

  <p>
   This gives you a readable/writable bitmap which allows you to read and
   write the individual pixels of the graphic.  For example, to create a
   graphic and then render it to a bitmapped image in memory, you may do
   something like:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    g = new graphics</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that there are already methods to write graphics to a bitmapped file
   format.  Using this constructor is only necessary if you want to read or
   write specific pixels of the rendered graphic <em>directly in memory</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
   The image can be then shown in its own window by calling the
   <code>.show[]</code> method:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    img1.show[]
   </code>
  </p>

      average color of the pixels within the region specified by the given
      coordinates.  Each coordinate may be a floating-point value, and if an
      incomplete pixel is sampled, it is weighted accordingly.
      The return value is an array of [red, green, blue, alpha]
      components, each between 0 and 1 inclusive.  The values for the
      coordinates can range from 0 to (<code>im.getWidth[]</code> or
      <code>im.getHeight[]</code>,) inclusive, indicating, for example, the
      left and right side of the pixel (or subpixel) to be sampled.  For
      example, in a 2x2 pixel image, you&#39;d want to sample [0,0,2,2] to average
      the whole image.

      color model, that is, to have an 24-bit true color model with an 8-bit
      alpha channel that supports transparency.  By default, when loading an
      image, the color model is preserved and may not support true color nor
      transparency.
        
    </td></tr><tr><td>makeMono[]</td><td>Forces a loaded image to have a one-bit
      monochrome color model, if your platform supports it.  This may perform

      may vary, but the following should be supported:
      
      <ul>
       <li><b>JPEG</b>: Does not support transparency.  Requires Java 1.4 or
        later.
       </li><li><b>PNG</b>: (Portable Network Graphics) Supports transparency and

      a array of (probably 4) <code>ComplexArray2D</code> objects (the class
      may change to be real values only) which correspond to the red, green,
      blue, and alpha channels.  This array can be turned back into

      transform</a> of an image, and reconstructs a 2-dimensional
      <code>ComplexArray2D</code> with the values from the image.  In other
      words, this is the inverse
      of <code>ComplexArray2D.toLogImage[<i>decenter=false</i>]</code>.  The
      behavior of this method will probably change.  See the sample
      program <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=FourierImage.frink">FourierImage.frink</a>
      for a sample of FFT transforming an image, writing it as a log-encoded
      image, reading it back, and inverse-transforming back to the original
      image.

      <p>The boolean center/decenter parameter (default is false) will center
      the DC (zero-frequency) term in the the center of the image to mimic the
      convention used by many digital image processing texts.  In other words,
      if <code>center</code> is true, the DC term will be located at the x
      coordinate (width + 1) div 2 (for an image that is an even number of
      pixels wide, this is just width/2) and at the y coordinate (height + 1)
      div 2 (for an image that is an even number of pixels high, this is just
      height/2).  If <code>center</code> is false, the DC component will be at
      (0, 0) The same flag should be passed to
      <code>toComplexArrayFromLog</code> and
      <code>ComplexArray2D.toLogImage</code>.

      between 0 and 1, where 1 means to use 100% of the window with the graphic
      (no borders.)  An insets value of 0.95 causes 5% of the window&#39;s width

    </td></tr><tr><td>resize[<i>width, height</i>]</td><td>Resizes an image to
      the new specified width and height and returns a new image.  It does not
      modify the original image.  If either <code>width</code> or
      <code>height</code> are the special value <code>undef</code> or
      <code>0</code>, then one dimension is constrained and the other
      dimension is calculated to preserve the aspect ratio of the original
      image.

      <p>
       This is generally <em>not</em> what you want to do when drawing an
       image into a <code>graphics</code> object.  You usually only want to
       do this if you&#39;re going to write the image to a file at a different
       size, or work with individual rescaled pixels.  To draw an
       <code>image</code> into a <code>graphics</code> object at any given
       size, use one of the methods in the <a href="#DrawingImagesIntoGraphics">Drawing images into graphics</a>

    </td></tr><tr><td>unsharpMask[width, amount]</td><td>Performs an unsharp mask
      (sharpening the image) with the specified (1 sigma) width and amount
      (which is usually 1 for 100% sharpening but can be lower or higher) and
      returns a new image. 

    </td></tr><tr><td>edgeDetect[]</td><td>Applies an edge detect filter to an
      image and returns a new image.

    </td></tr><tr><td>applyKernel[<i>array2D</i>]</td><td>Applies an arbitrary
      filter / kernel to an image and returns a new
      image.  <code><i>array2d</i></code> should be a 2-dimensional array of
      numbers with odd edge sizes.  For example, a sharpening filter is
      obtained by the array

      </p>

      <p>
       Note:  If the elements of the matrix sum to (approximately) 1, then the
       average brightness of each pixel in the result should be about the same
       as in the original image, and pixel values outside the range [0,255]
       will be clamped to that range.  However, if the elements of the matrix
       do <em>not</em> sum to 1, the color channels will be normalized so that
       they fall within the range [0,255] so the result is displayable.
       The relative brightness of each color channel is now preserved.

      false, values outside the range 0 to 255 will just be clamped to fit in
      that range.  This may result in a blank image!  However, some
      implementations of, say, edge detect filters do not normalize their
      output and this allows results to look more like other implementations.
      If <code>normalize</code> is true, the ranges will be normalized to fit

  <h3><a name="Animation">Animation</a></h3>
  <p>
   Animation is performed by calling
   the <code>replaceGraphics[<i>g</i>]</code> method on a graphics window
   (obtained by <code><i>graphics</i>.show[]</code>) which replaces the
   graphics object with a new graphics object and repaints the window.
  </p>

   <p>A short sample of animation is available in
   the <a href="http://futureboy.us/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=animate.frink">animate.frink</a>
     sample program.
     
  </p><p>
   An on-screen graphics window can be repainted as items are added to
   its <code>graphics</code> object.  Repainting is not done automatically,
   but is under the programmer&#39;s control.  This allows the screen to be
   repainted only when desired.
  </p>

  <p>
   The <code><i>graphics</i>.show[]</code> method returns an object with a
   <code>repaint[]</code> or <code>replaceGraphics[<i>g</i>]</code> method
   that instructs the graphics window to be painted.  <em>Tip:</em> don&#39;t save
   this object if you&#39;re not planning on doing incremental animation, or set
   the variable to some value such as <code>undef</code> when animation is
   complete.  This will allow the window&#39;s resources to be garbage-collected
   as soon as possible.

  <h3><a name="AnimatedImages">Animated Images</a></h3>
  <p>
   Frink can combine a series of <code>graphics</code> objects into a single
   animated GIF image very simply.  The series of steps is:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>Create an object of type <code>Animation</code>, optionally setting the
    frame rate.  The frame rate can be specified as either a time or a
    frequency, for example, <code>1/30 s</code> or <code>33 ms</code> or
    <code>30/s</code>.

    <p>
     <code>a = new Animation</code>
    </p>

    <p>
     or
    </p>
    
    <p>
     <code>a = new Animation[30/s]</code>
    </p>
    
   </li><li>Create a <code>graphics</code> object for each frame and draw into it
    using the methods described above.

    <p>
     <code>g = new graphics</code>
    </p>
    
   </li><li>Add the <code>graphics</code> object to the <code>Animation</code>
    object using its <code>add</code> method:

    <p>
     <code>a.add[g]</code>
    </p>

   </li><li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each frame of your animation.

   </li><li>Write the animated image to a file at any resolution using the
    <code><i>Animation</i>.write[<i>filename, width, height</i>]</code> method:

    <p>
     <code>a.write[&#34;animation.gif&#34;, 400, 400]</code>

  <h2><a name="TemperatureScales">Temperature Scales</a></h2>
  <p>
   Temperature scales that have their zero point (kelvin, Rankine) at absolute
   zero can be multiplied and converted normally.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>45 Rankine -&gt; K</code></p>
  
  <p>
   Temperature scales like Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Reaumur cannot be
   represented as normal multiplicative unit definitions because their zero
   point is not at absolute zero. 
   Thus, to avoid ambiguous &#34;do what I mean&#34; interpretation, you must use the
   functions <code>Fahrenheit[x]</code> or the shorter
   <code>F[x]</code>, <code>Celsius[x]</code> or the shorter
   <code>C[x]</code>, and <code>Reaumur[x]</code> to convert to/from these
   temperature scales: 
  </p>

  <p>
   To represent a Fahrenheit temperature:</p>

  <p>
   To convert another temperature scale to Fahrenheit:</p>

  <p>
   To represent a Celsius temperature:</p>

  <p>
   To convert another temperature scale to Celsius:</p>

  <p>
   To convert between scales (short version):</p>

  <p>
   This is equivalent to saying:</p>

  <p>
   <b>Note:</b> The units <code>degC</code> and <code>degF</code> only
   indicate the difference in the <em>size</em> of a degree in these various
   scales.  They should only be used when you&#39;re indicating the
   <em>difference</em> between two temperatures, (say, how much energy to
   raise the temperature of a gram of water by 5 degrees Celsius,)
   <em>not</em> for absolute temperatures.  Conversely, the conversion
   functions above should <em>not</em> be used when the <em>difference</em>
    between temperatures in two scales should be compared.
  </p>

  <p>
   The International System of Units (SI) considers the thermodynamic
   temperature in kelvin and the size of a degree in the kelvin system to have
   the same units.  See <a href="http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/13/3/">Resolution 3 of the 13th CGPM
    (1967/68)</a>.  This means that you can use <code>K</code> as either an
   absolute thermodynamic temperature, or a temperature difference.  However,
   this implies that Frink can&#39;t automatically guarantee that &#34;do what I mean&#34;
   calculations with temperature are correct, as it would have to magically
   guess what you mean.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="OtherDataSources">Other Data Sources</a></h2>
  <p>
   One of the main design goals of Frink was to allow new sources of data to
   be added in very easily.  These special sources are not necessarily defined
   in the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/frinkdata/units.txt">data file</a>.  The three data
   sources listed below retrieve data on demand from up-to-the-minute data on
   the Internet (and thus require connection to the Internet.)
  </p>

  <h3><a name="HistoricalUSPriceData">Historical U.S. Price Data</a></h3>

  <p>
   <b>Obligatory Disclaimer:</b> This feature requires connection to the
   internet.  If you are using Frink on a handheld device, you may incur
   connection charges.  Also, since I cannot guarantee the availability of any
   internet sites, this feature is intended only as a bonus that may not work
   reliably if at all.  You may also require some
   <a href="#ProxyConfiguration">proxy configuration</a> if you use an FTP
   proxy server to access the web.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The units &#34;dollar&#34; or &#34;USD&#34; indicate the value of a <em>current</em>
   U.S. dollar (which is arbitrarily chosen as the standard unit of currency.)
   Historical price data is available to allow comparisons between the
   historical &#34;buying power&#34; of U.S. currency.  This allows you to adjust
   historical prices for inflation.  These are represented by specially-named
   units containing both the currency and the year, separated by an
   underscore, for example:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>1.25 dollar_1960
   </li><li>dollar_1902
   </li><li>dollars_1902
   </li><li>10 dollars_1902
   </li><li>10 USD_1902
   </li><li>cent_1910
   </li><li>5 cents_1926
   </li><li>cent_1914
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   <strike>Data after 1913 is fetched live from the U.S. Department of Labor <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>
   Consumer Price Index data, specifially by retrieving and parsing <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/data/CPIAUCNS">this
    file</a>.  If that file is unavailable, the data will be fetched from a
   static file distributed with Frink, which is only as recent as your version
   of Frink.</strike>
  </p>

  <p>
   Since the U.S. Department of Labor <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of
   Labor Statistics</a> no longer maintains a machine-readable Consumer Price
   Index file, the file is fetched from the St. Louis Federal Reserve,
   specifically by
   parsing <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/data/CPIAUCNS">this file.</a>
   The new data is also cached in each Frink jar file in case you don&#39;t have
   network connectivity.  Note that as of 2024-06-30, this file has been
   changed from a nice text file to a giant, poorly-formatted HTML file that
   is 10 times larger so it will cost everyone more time and money to
   download. They said this is &#34;to make the table more accessible for our
   users.&#34;
  </p>

  <p>
   Data from 1700 to 1912 is based on some general economists&#39; guesses and
   should be taken with a grain of salt.  U.S. data before 1700 is not
   available, and probably wouldn&#39;t be meaningful unless you could convert
   between the value of pelts, tinder, and tallow.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Warning:</b> The BLS web and FTP servers seem to have frequent
   outages, and historical data will not be available if the servers are down,
   or if you are not connected to the Internet.  Frink contains an internal
   cache of the CPI data in this case.
  </p>

  <p>
   From 1913-present, you can even use monthly resolution by indicating the
   month after the year.  Months are 2 digits and padded with zeros:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>dollar_1969_08
   </li><li>dollars_1969_08
   </li><li>14.75 dollar_1941_12
   </li><li>14.75 USD_1941_12
   </li><li>dollars_1941_12
   </li><li>dollar_1941_12
   </li><li>15 cents_1965_10
   </li><li>4 cent_1929_01
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   Historical currency values can be converted to the current value.  For
   example to find today&#39;s cost of Mark Twain&#39;s passage to Europe and the Holy
   Land on the steamship <i>Quaker City</i> at a cost of $1250 in 1867
   (detailed in <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/twain/innocents/"><i>The Innocents
   Abroad</i></a>, the conversion of which was one of my first web projects):
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>1250 dollar_1867 -&gt; dollar</code></p>

  <p>
   And, you can add the 5 dollars/day in gold that they were encouraged to
   bring along to cover expenses for the 6-month trip:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>1250 dollar_1867 + 5 dollars_1867/day 6 months
    -&gt; dollar</code></p>

  <p>
   You can translate from one year and month to another, if you have a
   DeLorean, and want to watch a Reagan movie:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>50 cents_1955_11 -&gt; dollars_1985_10</code></p>

  <h3><a name="HistoricalBritishPriceData">Historical British Price Data</a></h3>
  <p>
   The units <code>Britain</code> or <code>Britain_Pound</code> or
   <code>Britain_currency</code> or <code>Great_Britain</code> or
   <code>Great_Britain_Pound</code> or <code>United_Kingdom_Pound</code>, or
   <code>England</code> or <code>England_currency</code> or <code>GBP</code>
   (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">ISO-4217</a>

   <code>pound</code> by itself--that&#39;s a measure of mass.)  The exchange rate
   between the pound and all other world currencies, see below, is fetched
   live from the Internet.
  </p>

  <p>
   Historical price data is available to allow comparisons between the
   historical &#34;buying power&#34; of British currency, both pre- and
   post-decimalization.  Data goes back to the year 1245.  I don&#39;t know if
   data before this would be very meaningful.
  </p>

  <p>
   Historical currency values are represented by specially-named units
   containing both the currency and the year, separated by an underscore.  All
   can be used in the plural, (<i>e.g.</i> <code>pound_1960</code> or
   <code>pounds_1960</code> or <code>GBP_1960</code> are all valid).  The

  <p>
   No wonder they went to decimalization.  It was either that or go to
   base-960 math.  
  </p>

  <p>
   To form combinations you can add them (using parentheses when necessary).
   For example, to convert a historical rate per day to current dollars/year:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>(4 pounds_1860 + 3 shilling_1860 + 5 pence_1860) / day
    -&gt; dollars/year</code></p>

  <p>
   I acknowledge that&#39;s a bit cumbersome.
  </p>

  <p>
   So, you can find out what a great amount of money was
   involved when the British Parliament announced a 20,000 pound prize in 1714
   for solving the 
   <a href="http://www.rmg.co.uk/explore/astronomy-and-time/time-facts/harrison">Longitude Problem</a>:

  <p>
   <code>20000 pound_1714 -&gt; dollars</code></p>

  <h2><a name="IntervalArithmetic">Interval Arithmetic</a></h2>
  <p>
   Frink has the magical ability to perform rigorous interval arithmetic
   throughout calculations.  So what is interval arithmetic?  Well, you can
   think of it as a &#34;new kind of number&#34; that represents a fuzzy range of
   values.  For example, you may know that a value lies between 1 and 2, but
   you&#39;re not quite sure where the value lies in that interval.  Depending on
   your philosophy, you can think of an interval as specifying a fuzzy error
   bound, or you can think of an interval as simultaneously taking on all
   values within its bounds.
  </p>

  <p>
   Frink can take this uncertain interval and propagate the uncertainty
   through its calculations, giving you the ability to see how the initial
   uncertainties in your values affect your final calculations.
  </p>

  <p>
   Currently, the way to indicate that something is an interval is to use the
   <code>new interval</code> syntax (although something more concise will
   likely be added later, and the output format may change.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = new interval[2,3]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The intervals can then be manipulated in mathematical expressions, either
   with ordinary scalar variables or other intervals:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>a * 3</code></p>

  <p>
   <code>a + b</code></p>

  <p>
   <code>a * b</code></p>

  <p>
   Intervals may also have a &#34;middle&#34; or &#34;main&#34; value which indicates the
   best-known value.  Note that values should be specified in increasing
   order.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    d = new interval[2, 2.5, 3]</code>
   <code>[14, 20.5, 28.2]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Of course, all intervals used in a calculation must have &#34;main&#34; values or
   the main value will be dropped, creating an interval with only upper and
   lower bounds.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note:  The boundaries and &#34;main&#34; values for intervals must be real
   numbers.  (These numbers can also have dimensions like feet, meters, etc.)
   Although there is a theory of complex intervals, it&#39;s much harder and may
   not get implemented any time soon, (although a very generous Frink user sent
   a copy of a rare $200 textbook on complex interval arithmetic which will
   help that situation!  Thanks, Joshua!)
  </p>

  <p>
   Lest you think that intervals are simpler than they are, I find that people
   better understand them when they consider the following case:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    x = new interval[-2,2]
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Now, let&#39;s square x.  Note that the values at each endpoint are equal to 4.
   However, over the range [-2,2], the value of x<sup>2</sup> ranges from 4,
   down to 0 (at x=0), and back up to 4.  Frink does the right thing for the
   values over this whole range:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>x^2</code></p>

  <p>
   Yeah, that <em>is</em> cool.  Frink tracks appropriate boundaries for
   intervals throughout all of your calculations.
  </p>

  <p>
   Frink&#39;s interval arithmetic is also rigorous in its treatment of error
   bounds.  It painstakingly controls the rounding direction of arithmetic
   operations so that the boundaries are guaranteed to include the
   next-largest or next-smallest representable floating-point number that
   contains the interval.  (See notes below on <a href="#IntervalArithmeticStatus">implementation status</a>.)  This
   is subtle, but I have spent a lot of work ensuring that the boundaries came
   out trustable, and no bigger than need be. For example:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>m = new interval[3,6]</code></p>

  <p>
   Note that the bottom bound is rounded down, and the top bound is rounded
   up.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Currently, almost all functions have been made interval-aware.
   Implementing all functions <em>to arbitrary precision</em> will take quite
   a bit of effort.  Of course, that would be much slower, too.  Error bounds
   are unfortunately not &#34;sharp&#34; for all operations (meaning as tight as they
   could possibly be with limited precision.)  I&#39;ve noted them as such in the
   <a href="#IntervalArithmeticStatus">Interval Arithmetic Status</a> section
   below.
  </p>

  <p>
   Not all operators such as <code>&lt; &gt; =</code> make unambiguous sense
   when applied to intervals, so Frink has introduced new operators to
   disambiguate these cases, and will implement other operators to work with
   intervals.  See the <a href="#IntervalComparisonOperators">Interval
    Comparison Operators</a> section below for more details.
  </p>

  <p>
   By default, degenerate intervals which have the same upper and lower bounds
   are &#34;collapsed&#34; into a single real number.  If you want to maintain them as
   intervals, call the function <code>collapseIntervals[false]</code> before
   constructing or performing mathematics on those intervals.
  </p>

  <p>
   As everyone uses Interval Arithmetic for the first time, they come upon two
   characteristic problems in the field:  the dependence problem and the
   overestimation problem.  These are common to all interval analysis, and not
   just to Frink, and are covered in extensive detail in the <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/faq.html#IntervalArithmetic">Interval Arithmetic section of the
    Frink FAQ.</a>
  </p>

  <p>

   the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.utep.edu/interval-comp/">Interval Computations</a>
   website. (Link opens in new window.)

  </p><h3><a name="IntervalArithmeticExample">Interval Arithmetic Example</a></h3>
  <p>
   Interval arithmetic is an incredibly powerful feature that allows programs
   that weren&#39;t necessarily written with intervals in mind to track error
   bounds throughout your calculations, and can be magically applied to
   programs that are already written.  For example, let&#39;s take some
   calculations to find the volume and density of a sphere:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    circumference = eval[input[&#34;Enter circumference of a sphere: &#34;]]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Now, you can run the program and enter something like &#34;9.1 inches&#34; for the
   circumference and &#34;5.1 ounces&#34; for the mass and find out the density of your
   baseball.  No surprises there.  But when you read the rules of Major League
   Baseball, you&#39;ll find that section 1.09 states:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    &#34;The ball shall be a sphere formed by yarn wound around a small core of
    cork, rubber or similar material, covered with two stripes of white
    horsehide or cowhide, tightly stitched together. It shall weigh not less
    than five nor more than 5 1/4 ounces avoirdupois and measure not less than
    nine nor more than 9 1/4 inches in circumference.&#34;
   </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
   So, using your exact same program above, and a little interval input,
   Frink can calculate the effects of these allowed variations and show you
   the allowed range of densities of <em>any</em> legal baseball:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>Enter circumference of a sphere:</code>
   <code>new interval[9, 9+1/4] inches</code></p>

  <p>
   The output indicates the range of uncertainties.  Note that two different
   intervals were used to perform this calculation, and the effects of their
   uncertainties was automatically tracked throughout all calculations.  All
   this in a program that wasn&#39;t even written with intervals in mind.
   Unscrupulous teams may also not that the official definition allows for a
   <em>large</em> variation in allowable densities of baseballs, which could
   be manipulated to your advantage.
  </p>

  <p>
   Also note that I put the units of measure (e.g. inches, ounces) outside the
   brackets.  You could put them inside the brackets, but you&#39;d just have to
   write them twice in this case.  Intervals can, of course, contain units of
   measure.
  </p>

  <p>
   By the way, I&#39;m working on a more concise notation for specifying
   intervals.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="IntervalComparisonOperators">Interval Comparison
    Operators</a></h3>
  <p>
   The relational operators (e.g. <code>&lt; == &gt;</code>, etc) work with
   intervals, but there are many ambiguous cases.  These operators try to Do
   The Right Thing when applied to intervals.  If you compare intervals that
   do not overlap, they return the appropriate result.  If, however, the
   intervals <em>do</em> overlap, they terminate the program with an error
   similar to the following:

  </p><blockquote>
   <p>
    Comparison expression: Using operator &gt; to compare intervals [1, 3]
    and [2, 4]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
   To handle the overlapping cases, Frink defines operators like &#34;certainly
   less than&#34; (<code>CLT</code>) and &#34;possibly less than&#34; (<code>PLT</code>).
   These operators can directly replace the normal relational operators.
   These new operators also work with normal real numbers, so you can still
   write programs that run using either intervals or real numbers as input.
  </p>

    <tbody><tr><th>Operator</th><th>Description
    </th></tr><tr><td>CEQ</td><td>Certainly equals

  <p>
   Example:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = new interval[1,3]</code>
   <code>
    true<br/>
   </code>
   <code>
    a CLT b<br/>
   </code>
   <code>
    false
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The “possibly” and “certainly” operators are related to each other by the
   following property: The “possibly” operator is the inverse of the opposite
   “certainly” operator. For example, <code>PLT</code> (possibly less than) is
   the inverse of the <code>CGE</code> (certainly greater than or equal)
   operator.  That is, when <code>PLT</code>
   returns <code>true</code>, <code>CGE</code> returns <code>false</code> and
   vice versa.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="IntervalArithmeticStatus">Interval Arithmetic Status</a></h3>
  <p>
   As noted above, not all functions are implemented for intervals.  The
   following table notes the status of the implementation of various operators
   and functions.  If a function does not appear on this list, it may still
   return values for interval arguments, but you shouldn&#39;t trust it because I
   haven&#39;t evaluated it for discontinuities or non-monotonicity yet.

  <h3><a name="DateTimeIntervals">Date/Time Intervals</a></h3>
  <p>
   An interval can also be composed of date/times.  The syntax is very similar:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    a = new interval[now[], now[] + 3 days]<br/>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    b = new interval[#1969-08-19#, #2005-06-11#]<br/>
   </code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   You can then perform <a href="#DateTimeArithmetic">Date/Time arithmetic</a>
   on the values.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="JavaIntrospection">Java Introspection</a></h2>
  <p>
   Missing a function that you need?  Frink can directly call Java code to let
   you take advantage of any Java library that&#39;s in your classpath.  Thus, you
   can use your favorite graphing package, connect to a database, perform
   lower-level networking, and more, directly from within Frink.
  </p>

  <p>
   Java objects can be manipulated just like Frink objects, by calling their
   methods or accessing their fields:
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Method call:</b>  Note that method calls on Java objects use square
   brackets, as they do in all Frink function and method calls:
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>
    <i>obj.method[args]</i>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Member variable access:</b>
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>
    <i>obj.field</i>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Java objects that implement the interfaces
   <code>java.util.Enumeration</code>, <code>java.util.Iterator</code>, or
   <code>java.lang.Iterable</code> can be used as a Frink enumerating
   expression, allowing them to be used in <code>for</code> loops or other
   places that allow <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expressions</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   The Java <code>null</code> will be converted to/from the Frink type
   <code>undef</code>.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="CreatingJavaObjects">Creating Java Objects</a></h3>
  <p>
   New Java objects can be created with the <code>newJava[classname]</code>
   and <code>newJava[classname, argList]</code> functions.  These call Java
   constructors with the specified arguments.  If the constructor takes a
   single argument, <code>argList</code> can be a single value, otherwise it
   should be an array of values.  If the constructor takes no arguments, then
   the last argument can be eliminated entirely.  The following creates a new
   Frame and calls some methods on the Frame to display it.  Note that the
   method calls require square brackets.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>f = newJava[&#34;javax.swing.JFrame&#34;, &#34;Frink Rules!&#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Arrays of Java objects, including primitives, can be constructed with the
   <code>newJavaArray[<i>classname</i>, <i>length</i>]</code>
   method.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    d = newJavaArray[&#34;byte&#34;, 1024]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   The classname should
   be a string containing either be a fully-qualified classname
   (e.g. <code>&#34;java.util.Hashtable&#34;</code>) or a primitive type name,
   (e.g. <code>&#34;int&#34;</code> or <code>&#34;double&#34;</code>).  Elements of Java
   arrays are addressed the same way as other <a href="#Arrays">arrays</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   Multi-dimensional arrays of Java objects can be created by the same
   function, but with an array of integers specifying the size of each
   dimension.  For example, the following creates a two-dimensional array of
   <code>double</code> with dimensions 3 by 4:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    d = newJavaArray[&#34;double&#34;, [3,4]]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   The initial value of all of the elements of a new Java array can be
   specified with the three-argument version of the
   function: <code>newJavaArray[<i>classname</i>, <i>length</i>, <i>initValue</i>]</code>:
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>
    d = newJavaArray[&#34;double&#34;, [3,4], 3.14]<br/>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Yes, this is <em>much</em> simpler than doing the same thing in Java!
  </p>

  <p>
   The methods on a Java object can be listed using the
   <code>methods[<i>obj</i>]</code> function:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    f = newJava[&#34;javax.swing.JFrame&#34;, [] ]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This makes it easy to experiment with Java libraries without writing
   extensive unnecessary boilerplate code, recompiling, etc.  Frink has been
   called &#34;an easier Java than Java.&#34;
  </p>

  <h3><a name="CallingStaticJavaMethods">Calling Static Java Methods</a></h3>
  <p>
   If you don&#39;t have an instance of the class, you can call static methods in
   Java classes using the <code>callJava[classname, methodname, argList]</code>
   function.  The following uses the <code>java.lang.Math</code> class to
   generate a random number.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>n = callJava[&#34;java.lang.Math&#34;, &#34;random&#34;, [] ]</code></p>

  <p>
   If the method requires no arguments, as in the above example, the last
   argument can be eliminated:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>n = callJava[&#34;java.lang.Math&#34;, &#34;random&#34;]</code></p>
  
  <p>
   Lame example, huh?  Especially when Frink can already generate random
   numbers.  The same syntax can be used to get a database driver, or
   something more interesting.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="AccessingStaticJavaFields">Accessing Static Java Fields</a></h3>
  <p>
   You can access static variables in a class without having an instance of
   the class by calling the <code>staticJava[classname, fieldname]</code>
   function.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>green = staticJava[&#34;java.awt.Color&#34;, &#34;GREEN&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   You can then call methods on that object:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>green.getRed[]</code></p>
  
  <p>
   If you&#39;ve constructed a Frame as in the <a href="#CreatingJavaObjects">Creating Java Objects</a> section above, you
   can set its background color by:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>f.setBackground[green]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   As of the 2014-04-21 release, Frink turns values returned from
   <code>staticJava</code> into their corresponding Frink types.  If you need
   the original, raw Java object (say, for code that checks object identity,)
   then you can call the three-argument version of the function, passing
   <code>false</code> as the third argument (this indicates that the value
   should <em>not</em> be mapped to a Frink type):
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>staticJava[&#34;javax.swing.SwingConstants&#34;, &#34;LEFT&#34;]</code></p>

  <p>
   <code>staticJava[&#34;javax.swing.SwingConstants&#34;, &#34;LEFT&#34;, false]</code></p>
  
  <h3><a name="CallingFunctionsAndMethodsByName">Calling Functions and Methods by Name</a></h3>
  <p>
   Sometimes you may have to call functions or methods by name.  For example,
   calling a method called <code><i>object</i>.next[]</code> on a Java object
   is impossible in Frink because <code>next</code> is a reserved word and
   produces a syntax error!  To get around this, use the
   <code>callByName[<i>object</i>, <i>methodName</i>, <i>argList</i>]</code>
   function.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>callByName[iterator, &#34;next&#34;, [] ]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If the first argument (normally an object) is <code>undef</code>, then the
   function with the specified name will be called.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the argument list is empty, as above, you can eliminate it entirely:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>callByName[iterator, &#34;next&#34;]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If the argument list is a single element, you don&#39;t have to pass it as a
   list: 
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>callByName[undef, &#34;println&#34;, &#34;yo&#34;]</code>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Similarly, you can get a reference to a function by calling
   <code>getFunction[<i>name</i>, <i>numArgs</i>]</code> which returns a
   reference to the function with the specified name (specified as a string)
   and number of arguments.  This can then be assigned to variables, or called
   as noted in the <a href="#AnonymousFunctions">Anonymous Functions</a>
   section of the documentation.

  <h3><a name="IteratingOverJavaCollections">Iterating Over Java Collections</a></h3>
  <p>
   The <code>for</code> loop can be used to iterate over the contents of most
   Java collections, including <code>array</code>, <code>Vector</code>,
   <code>Enumeration</code>, <code>Iterator</code>, <code>Collection</code>,
   <code>Map</code>, (which includes <code>Hashtable</code>,
   <code>HashMap</code>, <code>Properties</code> etc.), <code>Iterable</code>
   (which includes almost <em>all</em> <code>Collection</code> types in Java,
   and anything that can be used in Java&#39;s <code>foreach</code> statement)
   <i>etc.</i>
  </p>

  <p>
   For most Java collections, you can iterate through the contents using a
   <code>for</code> loop (which is really just a &#34;for each&#34; loop.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    for a = <i>javaObject</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If the Java class implements the <code>java.util.Map</code> interface (this
   includes classes like <code>HashMap</code>, <code>Hashtable</code>,
   <code>Properties</code>, etc), it can be treated like a Frink <a href="#Dictionaries">dictionary</a>.  This includes enumerating over
   <code>[key, value]</code> pairs:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    for [key,value] = <i>javaObject</i></code>
  </p>

  <p>
   All of these Java collections can be treated as <a href="#EnumeratingExpressions">enumerating expressions</a> in
   Frink, so all of the functions and methods that can operate on enumerating
   expressions can operate on Java collections.  For example, Java collections
   can be converted to other types using functions like
   <code>toArray</code>, <code>toSet</code>, <code>toDict</code>, or
   manipulated with functions like <code>join</code>, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you are using a Java data structure that puts Frink or Java data types
   into a data structure that needs a <code>java.util.Comparator</code> to
   perform the comparisons (<i>e.g.</i> <code>java.util.PriorityQueue</code>,)
   you can get Frink&#39;s default Comparator (which follows the same semantics as
   Frink&#39;s <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> <a href="#ThreeWayComparison">three-way
   comparison</a> operator,) by calling <code>getDefaultComparator[]</code>.
   Frink&#39;s default comparator will also compare Java objects that implement
   the <code>java.util.Comparable</code> interface so it can be used for Frink
   and Java data types.
  </p>

  <p>
   You can also implement a <code>java.util.Comparator</code> that uses a
   Frink function to perform the comparison.  The function should take two
   arguments <code>[a, b]</code> and return -1 if a&lt;b, 0 if a==b, and 1 if
   a&gt;b
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>c = new Comparator[ {|a,b| a &lt;=&gt; b } ]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   If additional data is needed to perform the comparison, you can pass an
   arbitrary expression as the second argument of the Comparator constructor.
   This data will be passed as a third argument to the function.  For example,
   the following Comparator sorts the elements by their distance from 20.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>c = new Comparator[ {|a,b,data| abs[a-data] &lt;=&gt; abs[b-data] }, 20]</code>
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="EmbeddingFrink">Embedding Frink</a></h2>
  <p>
   Not only can you call Java from Frink, but you can call Frink from Java.
   It&#39;s quite easy to embed a Frink parser into any Java program and give
   those programs all of the power of Frink.  It can take just a few lines of
   Java:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>//At the top of your file...</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Warning</b>: Frink is a Turing-complete programming language, and
   <code>parseString()</code> evaluates a string as a complete program.  A
   Frink interpreter normally has the ability to read your filesystem, call
   arbitrary Java code, execute infinite loops, allocate infinite amounts of
   memory, write large amounts of output, and do other things which may
   compromise your security.  Thus, if you&#39;re taking input from
   untrusted users, it&#39;s critical to call:

  </p><p>
   <code><i>interp</i>.setRestrictiveSecurity(true);</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   before parsing any user input.  This will enable the highest
   level of security, prohibiting all untrusted actions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   There are more methods for calling Frink from within a Java program.  One
   of the major problems is that converting from Frink types to Java types is
   almost always a narrowing operation.
  </p>

  <p>
   For example, if you try to put a Frink value into a Java integer:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>It could be too large.

   </li><li>It could be a non-integer (rational number, floating point).

   </li><li>It could be complex.
    
   </li><li>It may have wrong unit types.

   </li><li>It could be something else like a String or an Object.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   As a result, all of these interface methods throw a variety of exceptions.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="SampleCalculations">Sample Calculations</a></h2>
  <p>
   The following sections demonstrates some of the real-world calculations I&#39;ve
   made with Frink.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="MassAndVolume">Mass and Volume</a></h3>
  <p>
   Let&#39;s say you wanted to fill your bedroom up with water.  How much water
   would it take?  Let&#39;s say your room measures 10 feet by 12 feet wide by
   8 feet high.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>10 feet 12 feet 8 feet -&gt; gallons</code></p>

  <p>
   It would take approximately 7181 gallons to fill it.  Note that you get
   both an exact fraction and an approximation.  (If you don&#39;t want to see the
   fraction, put a decimal point in any of the numbers, like <code>10.</code>
   or <code>10.0</code> .)
   How much would that weigh, if you filled it with water?  Frink has the unit
   &#34;water&#34; which stands for the density of water.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>10. feet 12 feet 8 feet water -&gt; pounds</code></p>

  <p>
   So it would weigh almost 60,000 pounds.  What if you knew that your floor
   could only support 2 tons?  How deep could you fill the room with water?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>2. tons / (10 feet 12 feet water) -&gt; feet</code></p>

  <p>
   So you could only fill it about 0.53 feet deep.  It&#39;ll be a pretty sad pool
   party.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Liquor">Liquor</a></h3>
  <p>
   You can set variables on the fly, by using the assignment
   <code>=</code> operator.  Let&#39;s say you want to define a new unit
   representing the amount of alcohol in a can of (quality) 3.2 beer.  Keep in
   mind that 3.2 beer is measured by alcohol/weight, while almost all other
   liquors (and many beers) are usually measured in alcohol/volume.  The
   density ratio between water and alcohol is given by:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>water/alcohol</code></p>

  <p>
   Water is thus 1.267 times denser than alcohol.  3.2 beer (measured by
   weight) is thus actually 4.0 percent alcohol as measured by volume.  Now
   let&#39;s set that variable in terms of a beer&#39;s density of alcohol per volume
   so we can compare:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>beer = 12 floz 3.2 percent water/alcohol</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Then, you wanted to find out how many beers a big bottle of champagne is
   equal to:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>magnum 13.5 percent -&gt; beer</code></p>

  <p>
   You probably don&#39;t want to drink that whole bottle.  Now let&#39;s say you&#39;re
   mixing Jungle Juice (using a 1.75 liter bottle of Everclear (190 proof!))
   and Kool-Aid to fill a 5-gallon bucket (any resemblance to my college
   parties is completely intentional.)  What percent alcohol is that stuff?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>junglejuice = 1.75 liter 190 proof / (5 gallon)</code></p>

  <p>
   It&#39;s really not <em>that</em> strong.  About 8.8%.  But if you drink 5 cups
   of that, at 12 fluid ounces each, how many beers have you had?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>5 12 floz junglejuice -&gt; &#34;beer&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   Maybe that&#39;s why people were getting punched in the head.  <i>QED.</i>
  </p>

  <h3><a name="MoreLiquor">More Liquor</a></h3>
  <p>
   Some more useful calculations, most thanks to the lovely Steve Clymer:
  </p>

  <p>
   How many cases in a keg?  (A keg is a normal-sized keg, what those in the
   beer industry would call a &#34;half barrel,&#34; or <code>1/2 beerbarrel</code> in
   Frink notation.  I don&#39;t think they sell full barrels.  I&#39;ve never seen
   one.  It would weigh 258 pounds.  A &#34;pony keg&#34; is a &#34;quarter barrel&#34; or, in
   Frink notation, <code>ponykeg</code> or <code>1/4 beerbarrel</code>)
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>keg -&gt; case</code></p>

  <p>
   How many 12 fluid ounce drinks (<i>i.e.</i> cans o&#39; beer) in a keg?
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <code>keg -&gt; 12 floz</code></p>

  <p>
   What is the price in dollars per fluid ounce of alcohol when buying a keg of
   3.2 beer?  (Remember that 3.2 beer is measured in alcohol/weight, so we
   correct by the density ratio of <code>water/alcohol</code> to get alcohol by
   volume:)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>(60 dollars)/(keg 3.2 percent water/alcohol) -&gt; &#34;dollars/floz&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   A bottle of cheap wine?  (A &#34;winebottle&#34; is the standard 750 ml size.)
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>(6.99 dollars)/(winebottle 13 percent) -&gt; &#34;dollars/floz&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   A big plastic bottle of really bad vodka?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>(13.99 dollars)/(1750 ml 80 proof) -&gt; &#34;dollars/floz&#34;</code></p>

  <h3><a name="MovieMagic">Movie Magic</a></h3>
  <p>
   In the movie <i>Independence Day</i>, the alien mother ship is said to be
   500 km in diameter and have a mass 1/4 that of earth&#39;s moon.  If the mother
   ship were a sphere, what would its density be?  (The volume of a sphere is
   4/3 pi radius<sup>3</sup>)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>1/4 moonmass / (4/3 pi (500/2 km)^3) -&gt; water</code></p>

  <p>
   This makes the ship <em>280 times</em> denser than water.  This is 36 times
   denser than iron and more than 12 times denser than any known element!  As
   the ship is actually more a thin disc than a sphere, it would actually be
   even denser.  Since it contains lots of empty space, parts of it would have
   to be much, much denser.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the object is this dense and has such a large mass, what is its surface
   gravity?  Surface gravity is given by G mass / radius<sup>2</sup>, where G
   is the gravitational constant (which Frink knows about):
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>G 1/4 moonmass / (500/2 km)^2 -&gt; gravity</code></p>

  <p>
   The surface gravity of the spaceship is thus at least <em>twice</em>
   earth&#39;s gravity--and that&#39;s on the rim where gravity is weakest.  It
   would actually be much higher since it&#39;s much, much flatter than a sphere.
   I hope you&#39;re not the alien that has to go outside and paint it.

  <p>
   You can calculate the day that your company will run out of cash, based on
   their financial statements.  The following is an example for a real company,
   based on SEC filings, which read as the following:
  </p>

  <table summary="Sample Financial Data">
   <caption>Cash and Cash Equivalents (in thousands)</caption>
   <tbody><tr><th>December 31, 2000</th><th>June 30, 2001
   </th></tr><tr><td>$86,481</td><td>$41,601
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  <p>
   To make this more readable, you can define variables to hold values:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>burnrate = (#2001-06-30# - #2000-12-31#) / ((86481 - 41601) thousand dollars)</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>burnrate -&gt; dollars/day</code></p>

  <p>
   You can calculate the number of days until the money runs out at this rate:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>41601 thousand dollars / burnrate -&gt;
    &#34;days&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   Using date/time math, starting from the last report date (June 30,
   2001) you can find out the exact date this corresponds to:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>#2001-06-30# + 41601 thousand dollars /
    burnrate</code></p>

  <p>
   At the moment, I&#39;m watching CNN which is discussing some land-mines used in
   Afghanistan.  They showed a very small mine (about the size of a bran
   muffin) containing &#34;51 grams of TNT&#34; and they asked how much destructive
   force that carries.  Frink&#39;s data file includes how much energy is in a
   mass of TNT, specified by the unit &#34;TNT&#34;.  How many feet in the air could
   51 grams of TNT throw me, assuming perfect efficiency, and knowing
   <code>energy = mass * gravity * height</code>?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>51 grams TNT -&gt; 185 pounds gravity feet</code></p>

  <p>
   Yikes.  937 feet.  But the only difference between explosives and other
   combustible fuels is the rapidity of combustion, not in the quantity of
   energy.  How much gasoline contains the same amount of energy?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>51 grams TNT -&gt; &#34;teaspoons gasoline&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   1.29 teaspoons?  That&#39;s not much at all.  You&#39;re buying a huge amount of
   energy when you fill up your car.

  <h3><a name="JunkyardWars">Junkyard Wars</a></h3>
  <p>
   I can&#39;t watch <i>Junkyard Wars</i> (or lots of other television shows)
   without having Frink at my side.  This week the team has to float a
   submerged half-ton Cooper Mini... how many oil barrels will they need to
   use as floats?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>half ton -&gt; barrels water</code></p>

  <p>
   They&#39;re trying to hand-pump air down to the barrels, submerged &#34;2
   fathoms&#34; below the water.  If the guy can sustain 40 watts of pumping
   power, how many minutes will it take to fill the barrel?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>2 fathoms water gravity barrel -&gt; 40 watts minutes</code></p>

  <p>
   And how many food Calories (a food Calorie (with a capital &#39;C&#39;) equals 1000
   calories with a small &#39;c&#39;) will he burn to fill a barrel?
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>2 fathoms water gravity barrel -&gt; Calories</code></p>

  <p>
   Better eat a Tic-Tac first.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="BodyHeat">Body Heat</a></h3>
  <p>
   I&#39;ve seen lots of figures about how much heat the human body produces.  You
   can easily calculate the upper limit based on how much food you eat a day.
   Say, you eat 2000 Calories a day (again, food Calories with a capital &#34;C&#34;
   are equal to 1000 calories with a little &#34;c&#34;.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>2000 Calories/day -&gt; watts</code></p>

  <p>
   So, your average power and/or heat output is slightly less than a 100-watt
   bulb.  (Note that your heat is radiated over a much larger area so the
   temperature is much lower.)  Many days I could be replaced entirely with a
   100-watt bulb and have no discernible effect on the universe.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="MicrowaveCookery">Microwave Cookery</a></h3>
  <p>
   I&#39;m heating up yummy mustard greens in my microwave, but I don&#39;t want to
   overheat them.  I just want to warm them up.  If I run my 1100 watt
   microwave for 30 seconds, how much will their temperature increase?  I have
   a big 27 ounce (mass) can, and I&#39;ll assume that their specific heat is about
   the same as that of water (1 calorie/gram/degC):
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>1100 W 30 sec / (27 oz 1 calorie/gram/degC) -&gt; degF</code></p>

  <p>
   30 seconds should raise the temperature by no more than 18 degrees
   Fahrenheit, assuming perfect transfer of microwave energy to heat.
  </p>

  <p>
   Knowing this, I could see how efficiently my microwave <em>actually</em>
   heats food.  I could heat a quantity of water and measure the temperature
   change in the water.  I&#39;ll do that sometime if I can find my good
   thermometer.

  <h3><a name="Superman">Why is Superman so Lazy?</a></h3>
  <p>
   Superman is always rescuing school buses that are falling off of cliffs,
   flying to the moon, lifting cars over his head, and generally showing off.
   So why does he still allow so many accidents to happen?  Shouldn&#39;t he be
   able to rescue <em>everybody</em> who has a Volkswagen parked on their
   chest?
  </p>

  <p>
   While searching for answers, I found out three interesting things about
   Superman:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li>He&#39;s 6 feet 3 inches tall.
   </li><li>He weighs 225 pounds.
   </li><li>He gets his strength from being charged up with solar energy.
  </li></ol>

  <p>
   This is enough information to find some answers.  Frink has units called
   <code>sunpower</code> (the total power radiated by the sun) and
   <code>sundist</code> (the distance between the earth and the sun.)  Thus,
   we can find the sun&#39;s power that strikes an area at the distance of the
   earth (knowing the surface area of a sphere is 4 pi radius<sup>2</sup>):
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>earthpower = sunpower / (4 pi sundist^2)</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   This is about 1372 watts per square meter.  Superman is a pretty big
   guy--let&#39;s say the surface area he can present to the sun is 12 square
   feet.  (This is probably a bit high--it makes him an average of 23 inches
   wide over his entire height.)  This allows Superman to charge up at a power
   of:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>chargerate = earthpower 12 ft^2</code></p>

  <p>
   Superman thus charges up at the rate of 1530 joules/sec or 1530 watts.  At
   this rate, how long does he have to charge up before he can lift a 2 ton
   truck over his head?  (Knowing energy = mass * height * gravity)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>2 ton 7 feet gravity / chargerate -&gt; sec</code></p>

  <p>
   So, charging up for 25 seconds allows him to save one dumb kid who is acting
   as a speed bump.  So his power is huge but not infinite.  He couldn&#39;t
   sustain a higher rate (unless he showed off less by lifting the car only a
   foot or two.)  Lifting a truck every 30 seconds or so isn&#39;t bad,
   though.  He could be saving a lot more people.  So why doesn&#39;t he?
  </p>

  <p>
   Well, we&#39;ve all seen the movie.  He&#39;s using his super-powers to pick up
   chicks.  Literally.  Superman decides to take a break from saving lives and
   takes Lois Lane up in the sky for a joyride.  So how long does he have to
   charge up with solar energy to fly himself and Lois Lane (let&#39;s say she
   weighs 135 pounds) up to 15,000 feet?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>(225 + 135) pounds 15000 feet gravity / chargerate -&gt; minutes</code></p>

  <p>
   So, Superman has to charge up with solar energy for an <em>hour</em> to
   cart Lois up there.  With the same energy, he could have saved over 120
   trapped kids.  Keep in mind that Lois could do her part, too.  If she left
   her camera or big clunky shoes behind, he&#39;d have more energy left over
   to save people.  If she would manage to leave behind just two pounds of
   cargo weight, Superman would have enough energy to save another kid&#39;s life.
  </p>

  <p>
   Sure, he&#39;s a great guy, and, sure, he&#39;s the Defender of Truth, Justice, and
   the American Way, but can&#39;t he find a better use for his super-powers than
   schlepping some shiksa into the stratosphere?  Shovel my walk, he could, in
   3 seconds--and me with the sciatica.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="FartJokes">Fart Jokes</a></h3>
  <p>
   I received one of those endlessly-forwarded e-mails of dubious but
   &#34;interesting facts&#34; which said &#34;if you fart continuously for 6 years and 9
   months, you&#39;ll have enough gas to create the equivalent of an atomic bomb.&#34;
   Hee hee.  Cute.  (Thanks to Heather May Howard... being unable to easily
   calculate the veracity of this statement was one of the primary influences
   that showed how existing programs were too limited and inspired the
   creation of Frink.)  But I didn&#39;t believe it and wanted to check it.  The
   Hiroshima bomb had a yield of 12.5 kilotons of TNT, which is a very small
   bomb by today&#39;s standards.  How many horsepower would that be?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>12.5 kilotons TNT / (6 years + 9 months) -&gt; horsepower</code></p>

  <p>
   Can <em>you</em> produce a 329-horsepower blowtorch of a fart?  I doubt it.
   That&#39;s the power produced by a Corvette engine running just at its melting
   point.  A one-second fart with that much power could blow me 1000 feet
   straight up.  To produce that kind of energy, how much food would you have
   to eat a day?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>12.5 kilotons TNT / (6 years + 9 months) -&gt; Calories/day</code></p>

  <p>
   Ummm... can <em>you</em> eat over 5 million Calories a day?  (Again, note
   that these are <em>food</em> Calories with a capital &#39;c&#39; which are equal to
   1000 calories with a small &#39;c&#39;.)  If you were a perfect fart factory,
   converting food energy into farts with 100% efficiency, and ate a normal
   2000 Calories/day, how many years would it <em>really</em> take?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>12.5 kilotons TNT / (2000 Calories/day) -&gt; years</code></p>

  <p>
   17,000 years is still a huge underestimate; I don&#39;t know how much of your
   energy actually goes into fart production.  Oh well.  To continue the
   calculations, let&#39;s guess your butthole has a diameter of 1 inch (no,
   <em>you</em> go measure it.)  Let&#39;s also guess that the gas you actually
   produce in a fart is only 1/10 as combustible as pure natural gas.  What
   would be the velocity of the gas coming out?
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>12.5 kilotons TNT / natural_gas / (6 years + 9 months)
    / (pi (.5 in)^2) 10 -&gt; mph</code></p>

  <p>
   Nobody likes sitting next to a 280-mile-per-hour fart-machine.
   <i>Lesson:</i> Even the smallest atomic bombs are <em>really
   unbelievably</em> powerful and whoever originally calculated this isn&#39;t any
   fun to be around if they really fart that much.
  </p>

  <p>
   Fart jokes.  Sheesh.  If Frink isn&#39;t a huge success, it&#39;s not because I
   didn&#39;t pander to the Lowest Common Denominator.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="AdvancedFarting">Advanced Farting</a></h3>
  <p>
   The above order-of-magnitude estimate shows how far off the mark that the
   fart e-mail was.  Not content with that, I found some medical studies that
   allowed me to do a more detailed analysis of the average person&#39;s available
   fart energy.
  </p>

  <p>
   What do you think are the most flammable gases in a fart?  Most people
   think it&#39;s methane, but I found some medical studies that disprove this.
   Most people hardly have <em>any</em> methane in their intestines.  For
   example, one study stated that only 4 out of 11 people had any detectable
   methane in their intestines!  So what&#39;s the rest of the gas?
  </p>

  <table summary="Gases Present in Human Intestines by Volume">
    <tbody><tr><th>Gas</th><th>Percent by Volume
    </th></tr><tr><td>Nitrogen</td><td>64%
    </td></tr><tr><td>Carbon Dioxide</td><td>14%
    </td></tr><tr><td>Hydrogen</td><td>19%
    </td></tr><tr><td>Methane</td><td>3.2%
    </td></tr><tr><td>Oxygen</td><td>0.7%
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  <p>
   These studies also note that the average person has 100 milliliters of gas
   present in their intestinal tract at any given time.  The average person
   expels 400-2000 ml of gas daily (and I&#39;m not talking about through the
   mouth and nose.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Okay, that&#39;s almost enough information to figure out available fart energy.
   Now all we need to know is the energy of combustion of the flammable gases.
   Of the above, only hydrogen and methane are readily combustible.  Looking
   up their energies of combustion:
  </p>
  
  <table summary="Combustion energy of gases in human intestine">
    <tbody><tr><th>Gas</th><th>Energy of Combustion in kJ/mol
    </th></tr><tr><td>Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)</td><td>285.8
    </td></tr><tr><td>Methane (CH<sub>4</sub>)</td><td>890.8
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

  <p>
   Okay, that&#39;s plenty enough information to find out how much energy is
   released in a day of farting!  Say you&#39;re on the farty end of the scale,
   and you produce the 2000 ml of gas each day.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that the energies above are given in kJ/mol, but we have volumes in
   milliliters.  As you may have learned in chemistry class, a mole of any gas
   at standard temperature and pressure takes up the same volume.  Frink knows
   this as <code>molarvolume</code>.
  </p>

  <p>
   The total energy in the hydrogen (keeping in mind that hydrogen makes up
   19% of the 2000 ml volume) is given by:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>h2energy = 2000 ml / molarvolume mol * 19 percent * 285.8 kJ/mol</code></p>

  <p>
   The combustible hydrogen thus produces 4800 joules (per day.)  Now, for the
   methane, which makes a smaller percentage, but releases more energy per
   mole:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>methaneenergy = 2000 ml / molarvolume mol * 3.2 percent * 890.8 kJ/mol</code></p>

  <p>
   The energy in the combustible methane is thus about 2500 joules (per day),
   about half the energy produced from the hydrogen.  Thus, the grand total of
   energy produced by combustible farts by a farty person in a day, in food
   Calories (with a capital C, remember--these are what a physicist would call
   a kilocalorie) is:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>methaneenergy + h2energy -&gt; Calories</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Which gives a result of about 1.76 Calories/day of energy available from
   burning your farts.  (About 1.16 Calories from hydrogen, and about 0.60
   Calories from methane.)  This is out of the 2000 Calories that an average
   person eats a day.  Or, one part in about 1133 of the energy in the food
   you eat is available in fart energy, (again, for a gassy person.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Thus, a good estimate to the problem stated above is that a real (gassy)
   human would need to save their farts for:

  </p><p>
   <code>12.5 kilotons TNT / ((methaneenergy + h2energy) / day)
    -&gt; years</code></p>

  <p>
   or about <em>19 million years</em> to make the equivalent of the energy in
   a (small) atomic bomb!  So the estimate given in that e-mail is off by a
   factor of at least 2.8 million!
  </p>

  <p>
   Now, you know the true facts about farts.  Frink is now complete, and I
   couldn&#39;t be prouder.  Umm... thanks, Heather May.

  <h3><a name="MoreIncorrectFacts">More Incorrect Facts</a></h3>
  <p>
   That e-mail has a higher density of incorrect facts than just about
   anything I&#39;ve seen.  Below are several more examples.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="QE2">QE2</a></h4>
  <p>
   &#34;The cruise liner, Queen Elizabeth II, moves only six inches for each gallon
   of diesel that it burns.&#34;
  </p>

  <p>
   From <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/319027.stm">a page of
   facts about the QE2,</a> we find that the ship consumes 18 tons of fuel per
   hour at a service speed of 28 knots.  By legislation in many areas, diesel
   fuel must have a density no higher than 0.85 kg/liter (if it were watered
   down, it would be higher.)
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>18 tons/hour / (28 knot) / (.85 kg/liter) -&gt; feet/gallon</code></p>

  <p>
   They&#39;re very, very wrong.  It actually travels about 33.5 feet per gallon,
   or 157 gallons/mile.  They&#39;re only off by a factor of 67.  Still not great
   gas mileage, though.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="HamburgersAndCars">Hamburgers and Cars</a></h4>
  <p>
   The same e-mail states &#34;pound for pound, hamburgers cost more than new
   cars.&#34;
  </p>

  <p>
   Let&#39;s see... let&#39;s try with a medium-expensive, light car.  A
   2001 Corvette Z06 weighs 3,115 pounds and costs $48,055.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>(48055 dollars) / (3115 lb) -&gt; dollars/lb</code></p>

  <p>
   I know <em>I</em> don&#39;t pay $15/lb for hamburger.
  </p>

  <p>
   Let&#39;s try with a light, very cheap car.  A quick lookup showed that a 2001
   Hyundai Accent costs $10,184 and weighs 2255 pounds.  That&#39;s still $4.51 a
   pound.  Do <em>you</em> pay that much for hamburger?  Maybe a finished
   hamburger in a good restaurant, certainly not for hamburger.  This is
   deceptive if not outright wrong.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="GetTheProvisions">&#34;Get The Provisions...&#34;</a></h4>
  <p>
   By the way, did you ever notice that in the movie <i>Stand By Me</i> that
   Gordie <em>really</em> gets ripped off for hamburger?  Supposedly set in
   1960, Gordie buys &#34;a buck and a half of hamburger&#34; which is slapped down in
   a tiny wrapper that couldn&#39;t contain more than 3/4 of a pound.  Probably a
   half pound--it looks like all wrapper.  (You estimate it.)  Converting to
   modern prices:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>1.50 dollars_1960 / (.75 lb) -&gt; dollars/lb</code></p>

  <p>
   Gordie paid a modern equivalent of $27/lb for that hamburger.  Perhaps a
   smarter shopper <em>could</em> have gotten more for Vern&#39;s 7 cents.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="Typing">Typing</a></h4>
  <p>
   The same e-mail says &#34;the longest word that can be typed using only the
   left hand is &#39;stewardesses&#39;.&#34;  Well, Frink is good for doing word stuff
   too.  Using the single word list from the 
   <a href="http://icon.shef.ac.uk/Moby/">Moby wordlist</a>,
   the following program finds lots of 12-letter alternatives, and several
   longer:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    infile = &#34;<i>path to words file</i>&#34;</code>
   

   
    <code>leftPattern = %r/^[qwertasdfgzxcvb]+$/i</code>
   
   <code>
    matches = select[lines[infile], leftPattern]</code>
   
   <code>
    sort[matches, { |a,b| length[a] &lt;=&gt; length[b] } ]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   (Actually, my original program was only 2 lines, but this is easier to
   read.  The program could be written lots of ways.)  Some of the results are:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>
    12: stewardesses</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   I have no idea what that last word means.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="BiblicalReferences">Biblical References</a></h3>
  <p>
   So you want to build an ark, do you?  And not an Ark of the Covenant, but
   the boat.  How bad was that flood?
  </p>

  <p>
   The bible is also quite precise in its measurement of the flood.  Genesis
   7:19-20 states that &#34;And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth;
   and all the mountains, that were under the whole heaven, were covered.
   Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were
   covered.&#34;
  </p>

  <p>
   Okay, so the highest mountains of the earth were covered, plus an extra 15
   cubits (approx 27 feet) for good measure.  The current measurements for
   highest mountain is Mt. Everest at 29030.8 feet (according to the highly
   dubious and utterly non-trustable 2002 Guinness Book of World Records.)  I
   know that Everest is growing slowly, (best estimates are 2.4 inches/year)
   so we&#39;ll discount for that.
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    depth = 29030 feet + 15 biblicalcubits - (2.4 inches/year 4000 years)
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   About 28257 feet of water.  This was deposited over 40 days.  The rainfall
   was thus:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>rainfall = depth / (40 days)</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Or about 353 inches/hour, or 29 feet/hour.  A good rain around here is
   about an inch an hour.  The very rainiest places on earth like <a href="http://www.extremescience.com/wettest.htm">Cherrapunji</a>
   get about this much rain in a <em>year</em>.  (I&#39;m campaigning Colorado
   farmers to sin a bit more...)

  <h3><a name="Emc2">E=mc<sup>2</sup></a></h3>
  <p>
   Everyone knows Einstein&#39;s E=mc<sup>2</sup> equation, but to apply it is
   often very difficult because the units come out so strange.  Let&#39;s see, I
   have mass in pounds, and the speed of light is 186,282
   miles/second... ummm... what does that come out to?  In Frink the
   calculation becomes transparently simple.
  </p>

  <p>
   If you took the matter in a teaspoon of water, and converted that to
   energy, how many gallons of gasoline would that equal?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>teaspoon water c^2 -&gt; &#34;gallons gasoline&#34;</code></p>

  <p>
   Unbelievable.  The energy in a teaspoon of water, if we could extract it,
   is equal to burning more than 3 <em>million</em> gallons of gasoline.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="DaysOld">Days Old</a></h3>
  <p>
   The November 2001 edition of <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> magazine has a
   charming article called &#34;Stellar Guides for Your Birthday&#34; by Jeff
   A. Farinacci (p. 63), which provides a list of &#34;nearby&#34; stars and their
   distances in light-years or light-days.  This allows you to look at the
   light coming from a star that was emitted the day you were born.  It
   includes a <a href="http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-resources/basic-programs-from-sky-telescope/">28-line
   BASIC program, <code>daysold.bas</code></a> to calculate how many days old
   you are on a certain date. 
   As you know by now, the essential calculation can be done in one line of
   Frink.  For example, the bright star Pollux is about 33.7 light-years away
   (12314 days, based on the Hipparcos satellite&#39;s parallax measurement of
   96.74 milliarcseconds) and the light it emitted on the day I was born will
   finally reach earth on the date:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>#1969-08-19# + 12314 days</code></p>

  <p>
   or, to calculate the date directly from the parallax, we can use the
   following, where <code>au</code> is an astronomical unit (the average
   distance between the earth and the sun,) and <code>c</code> is the speed of
   light, the values of which are known to Frink:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>#1969-08-19# + au / (96.74 milliarcsec) / c</code><br/>
  </p>

  <p>
   This gives the same date as the calculation above (May 7, 2003.)  I was
   amazed to find that the universe has conspired to produce a beautiful
   conjunction on this date.  Pollux will form a straight line with the moon
   and Jupiter in the western sky on that night:
  </p>

  <p>
   <img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/images/conjunction.png" width="412" height="414" alt="View of the sky on May 7, 2003"/></p>
  
  <p>
   (Note:  The three objects aren&#39;t as close together as it may look in this
   picture.  The sky is big.)  These screenshots show how it will look at 10 PM
   Mountain Daylight Time.
  </p>

  <p>
   Below is a 45-degree chunk of sky looking due west.  This will give you a
   better idea of how the sky will look as you face west.  You&#39;ll probably see
   Pollux and Castor quite clearly.  Castor is the bright star directly
   to the right of Pollux.  Castor and Pollux will appear to make a horizontal
   line at this time.
  </p>

  <p>
   <img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/images/conjunction2.png" width="437" height="397" alt="45-degree view of the sky looking West during conjunction"/>
  </p>

  <p>
   It shouldn&#39;t be hard to find.  Look west.  The moon will be the brightest
   object in the sky, and Jupiter will be the second-brightest.  Follow the
   line from Jupiter to the moon.  Pollux is by far the brightest star along
   that line (it has a dimmer twin Castor, which will be on the right.)  The
   moon is in the center and Jupiter and Pollux are equal distances on either
   side of the moon.  Follow the wise men.  Bring gold.  I already have lots
   of frankincense and myrrh.

  <p>
   <b>Alan&#39;s Editorializing</b>: This article also underlines one of the
   things I am growing to miss in most physical equations and all programs
   written in other languages... the loss of units.  Everything is an
   unexplained number, and inscrutable conversion factors are strewn liberally
   throughout.  This is exactly the type of thing that Frink was designed to
   address.  For example, a line in the article indicates:
  </p>

  <p>
   <i>The parallax-to-distance formula is simple: d=1/p, where p is the
    parallax angle in arcseconds and d is the distance in parsecs (3.26
    light-years).</i>
  </p>

  <p>
   This description is unfortunate.  1 divided by an angle (which is
   dimensionless) is still dimensionless, <em>not</em> a distance.  This is
   better specified by saying that the formula is distance=(orbital
   radius)/(parallax angle).  Since the parallax angles are specified with
   respect to Earth&#39;s orbital radius, you can write the equation as
   <code><i>d</i> = au/<i>p</i></code>. &#34;<code>au</code>&#34; is an astronomical
   unit, the average distance between the Earth and the Sun, which is included
   in Frink&#39;s standard data file.  Then, p can be specified in <em>any</em>
   angular units and distance can be automatically converted to light-years or
   light-days instead of parsecs (or into feet, if you want).  As always,
   <em>Frink makes the units of measurement transparent, and helps to ensure
   that your calculations make sense.</em> So, using the <a href="http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS">Hipparcos</a>
   satellite&#39;s measurements for the parallax of the closest star, Proxima
   Centauri (okay, second-closest, smartypants):
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>au / (.7723 arcsec) -&gt; lightyears</code></p>

  <p>
   This way, we learn something about the <em>nature</em> of the physical
   calculation which we can generalize, rather than having an equation that
   only works with one weird system of measurement.  (Although professional
   astronomers like to use parsecs, I think it&#39;s a horrible, intentionally
   exclusive, geocentric measurement and they&#39;re just being difficult.  There
   was even an article in <i>Sky &amp; Telescope</i> a while back which
   intimated that some astronomers would sneer and giggle at you if you used
   light-years in a professional publication or speech.)  Using our deeper
   knowledge, we can see how much more accurate the Hipparcos satellite would
   be if it were put into Jupiter&#39;s orbit, or how accurate its instruments
   need to be to achieve a certain accuracy in distance measurements.  We&#39;ve
   learned something more general.

  <h4>Finding Your Own Star</h4>
  <p>
   Now you want your own star, don&#39;t you?  You might take a look at a list of
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_brightest_stars">the
    brightest stars in the sky</a>
   and look the stars&#39; distances in light-years.  This will give you an idea
   of the bright stars, and give you their Hipparcos catalog numbers.  Using
   the Hipparcos catalog number given in that table, you can look up that star
   from 
   <a href="http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=HIPPARCOS&amp;page=multisearch2">this
    Hipparcos search form,</a> find its Geometrical Parallax (field H11, which
   is probably given in milliarcseconds) and plug that number into the
   equation shown above.  At some point, I may make a Frink Server Page that
   automates this.  But you might learn more just by doing the calculations
   yourself.
  </p>

  <p>
   Whether you have a kid who is 8.6 years old (for Sirius which is the
   brightest star in the sky and 3141 light-days away,) someone turning 11.4
   (Procyon), turning 16.8 (Altair) or someone turning 65.1 (Aldebaran,) a
   star is a great gift and  might just start a love of astronomy.  I can&#39;t
   promise that the moon and the planets will line up for <em>them</em>,
   though.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that there is some uncertainty in measuring parallaxes, often several
   percent, and thus the dates are somewhat uncertain, so it&#39;s a gift you can
   give <em>any</em> time around the date.  For example, the standard error
   for the parallax of Pollux is 0.87 milliarcseconds (parallax error is field
   H16 in the Hipparcos catalog, specified in milliarcseconds) which leads to
   an actual date that can vary from around January 17, 2003 to August 27,
   2003 -- a range of over 7 months.  Just have fun and celebrate your stars
   when you want!
  </p>

  <h3><a name="ModelSolarSystem">Model Solar System</a></h3>
  <p>
   This one is fun.  I didn&#39;t have a grasp of the size difference between the
   Earth and the Moon so I wanted to make a little scale model in my home.  It
   would be best to use spheres of the appropriate sizes, but I don&#39;t have
   that many balls.  Instead, I decided to cut circles out of paper.  My
   deciding dimension was the size of the piece of paper I used to cut out the
   pieces.  I could only get a 7-inch diameter circle for the Earth (3.5-inch
   radius), so this defined my scale, which I saved in a variable for use in
   later calculations:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>scale = earthradius / (3.5 inches)</code></p>

  <p>
   The standard data file contains information about the dimensions of the
   planets, <code>earthradius</code> being one of those.  Now how big should
   the Moon circle be?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>moonradius / scale -&gt; inches</code></p>

  <p>
   Okay, using my rolling ruler, I cut out a circle with radius 0.95 inches
   (diameter 1.9 inches).  There&#39;s the Moon.  It&#39;s interesting to see the
   difference in size between the Earth and Moon:
  </p>

  <p>
   <img src="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/images/earthmoon.jpg" width="280" height="210" alt="Earth-Moon Sizes"/>
  </p>

  <p>
   Now, to place them properly... how far away should they be at that scale?
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>moondist / scale -&gt; feet</code></p>

  <p>
   Okay, stick the Earth to one wall, and then measure a distance 17.5 feet
   away, and stick the Moon to that.  <em>Installed!</em>
  </p>

  <p>
   From each vantage point, you can see how big the other actually looks from
   that distance.  Standing by the Earth, you can see how big the Moon looks
   (you&#39;ve seen the Moon, but it&#39;s a smaller angle than you might guess... the
   Moon really doesn&#39;t take up much sky, only about half a degree in
   diameter.)  You can verify this by holding a fingernail out at arm&#39;s
   length, comparing it to the size of your Moon model, and then going outside
   and doing the same to the Moon, if you can see it.
  </p>

  <p>
   Now walk over to the Moon and look at the Earth.  It would be pretty big!
   Earth would appear about 3.66 times wider in diameter (in Frink notation,
   <code>earthradius/moonradius</code>, or 13.4 times larger in area (
   <code>pi earthradius^2 / (pi moonradius^2)</code> ).
  </p>

  <p>
   Just to verify, I wanted to make sure that the visible angles in my model
   match real life.  The visual angle of an object which does not subtend a
   large angle can be expressed as <code>angle = width / distance</code>.  The
   angle normally comes out in radians if width and distance are in the same
   units, but this is Frink.  You can get the answer out in degrees, or
   arcminutes if that&#39;s where your heart lies:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>1.9 inches / (17.5 feet) -&gt; arcminutes</code></p>

  <p>
   Yep, that&#39;s just the right number of arcminutes.  From Earth, the Sun and
   the Moon both appear just over half a degree in diameter, or about 32
   arcminutes (an arcminute is 1/60 of a degree).  It all works out.  Note
   that in the standard data file, radians are dimensionless units (a radian
   is defined as &#34;1&#34;.)  This is because radians are dimensionless units, but
   you can convert values in radians to other angular units.
  </p>

  <p>
   By the way, a more accurate angular formula that is valid for large
   <em>and</em> small angles subtended by a sphere with a given radius at a
   specified distance is:
  </p>
  
  <p>
   <code>2 arcsin[<i>radius</i>/(<i>radius</i> + <i>distance</i>)] -&gt; degrees</code>
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that inverse trigonometric functions (<code>arcsin</code>,
   <code>arccos</code>, <code>arctan</code>) have their output in radians.
   This is easily converted to whatever angular units you want, as above.  You
   don&#39;t see that the output is in radians (if you use the standard data file)
   because radians are dimensionless numbers.  You just gotta be a bit careful
   here, or make the minor change in your units file to make radians a
   fundamental dimension.  (Read the documentation in the units file... the
   units file is otherwise radians-correct.)

   <b>Nostalgic Digression:</b> I remember a cool black-and-white movie we saw
   in my Kindergarten class about making a scale model of the solar system.
   It involved a <em>huge</em> vertical circular sign representing the Sun
   that somebody had built for the film and a car driving a measured distance
   away to look at it.  (A bit confusing, though.  I remember them saying
   &#34;here we are, 93 million miles away!&#34; and they were still in the same
   park.)  Good stuff, and I&#39;m glad I finally made my own model.  It helps me
   understand how cool the Apollo missions were.  But my enthusiasm is
   tempered by the fact that I&#39;m just now figuring out stuff they tried to
   teach me in Kindergarten.
  </p>

  <p>
   Now go make your own model.  Pick your own scale to fit your surroundings
   and materials.  It&#39;s fun.  In my model, Jupiter would have to
   be a sphere 6.59 feet in diameter, placed about 5.5 miles away right now.
   I&#39;ll have to get a bigger place.

  <p>
   Now that you know how to calculate the size in Frink yourself, I&#39;ve gone
   ahead and built a Frink Server Page that lets you
   <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/solar.fsp"><b>design your own!</b></a>
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Homework:</b>  In your model, figure and/or plot the following:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>Orbit of the Space Shuttle (about 300 km above the surface of the
    Earth)  Wow.  That&#39;s barely up there.
   </li><li>Orbit of a geosynchronous satellite (42164 km from the <em>center</em>
    of the Earth, or about 22300 miles from the <em>surface</em> of the Earth.)
    Stand this far away from the Earth circle... that&#39;s how big it would look.
   </li><li>The sizes of the Sun, other planets, and their moons.
   </li><li>The speed of light in your model.
  </li></ul>

  <h3><a name="MCO">Saving Hundreds of Millions of Dollars</a></h3>
  <blockquote>
   <p>
    &#34;The MCO [Mars Climate Orbiter] MIB [Mishap Investigation Board] has
    determined that the root cause for the loss of the MCO spacecraft was the
    failure to use metric units in the coding of a ground software file,
    &#34;Small Forces,&#34; used in trajectory models.  Specifically, thruster
    performance data in English units instead of metric units was used in the
    software application code titled SM_FORCES (small forces).&#34;</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
   This is not to take away from the designers of a wonderfully complex
   spacecraft that can travel to Mars; that&#39;s an incredibly difficult problem,
   and I couldn&#39;t do it.  However, this is just the type of error that Frink
   was designed to help avoid, and because <em>I</em> make these type of
   errors a lot, I&#39;ve designed this tool to help me.  Frink tracks units
   through <em>all</em> calculations and makes conversions between them
   transparent.  This is why I&#39;m working toward making Frink a feasible
   solution for calculations of this type.
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Update:</b>  I received the following from <a href="http://www.norvig.com/">Peter Norvig</a>:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
   <p>
    &#34;I ran across Frink, and as a member of the MCO review board, I
    appreciate your efforts.  Note, however that more than just language
    support is necessary.  First, you&#39;d have to have conventions on data
    I/O -- the misinterpreted data was from a file, not from another
    function in the program.  Also, there was an issue of software reuse
    -- the errant portion of the system had been used before on a previous
    mission, and in that case it was used in a non-critical,
    non-navigational way.  It was not properly reviewed because the team
    did not realize that in MCO it became critical.&#34;
   </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
   The points above are well-taken.  Proper parsing of units can be easily
   achieved in Frink with a simple, appropriate comment in the data file. <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/fsp/colorize.fsp?f=unittable.frink">unittable.frink</a> shows
   how Frink can parse a file containing units of measure.  All that is needed
   is to add a <em>single comment</em> to the data file that contains the
   units of measure of each data column.  Frink then reads each column with
   the appropriate units of measure and scale, using any units of measure that
   Frink knows about as input, and Frink parses them and works with them
   properly.  See its <a href="https://interjectedfuture.com/explain-a-kleisli-category/unittable.txt">sample data file</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   Frink and its <code>eval[x]</code> function could always trivially handle
   the case where each number in a file has its units of measure specified
   with the number, e.g. &#34;<code>3.5 km/s</code>&#34;.  That&#39;s literally
   <em>zero</em> effort to parse with Frink, and is slightly less compact, but
   that&#39;s a very small price to pay, compared to mission failure.
  </p>

  <p>
   Of course, there&#39;s no simple solution for someone completely not reading
   the specification documents, but the fact that a file completely omits any
   units of measure would be a good warning flag to double-check your sources,
   I&#39;m growing to fear and avoid any system that treats every physical
   measurement as an unexplained dimensionless number, as most programming
   languages have for the past few decades.  We can do better.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="ChangingSyntax">Changing Syntax</a></h2>
  <p>
   Keep in mind that the syntax represented in this document <em>will</em>
   change as Frink evolves.  The current parser just makes it easier for me to
   test certain features, and I intentionally refuse to spend a lot of time on
   it at this point.  The internals of the language should be the first
   concern, and the external representation is free to change.  Frink should
   be equally usable whether you want to load and save your data in the
   current mathematical notation, in a (LISP-like) prefix notation, in a (HP
   calculator-like) Reverse-Polish postfix notation, from a
   visually-based GUI, in MathML, TeX, XML, or whatever other
   flavor-of-the-month format the kids are crazy about these days.  The
   internals of the language are intentionally agnostic on this point, as they
   should be in a flexible design.
  </p>

  <p>
   On the other hand, I always want to keep Frink easy to use and transparent
   for the quick calculations as it is now.  Turning it into a language that
   forces an encumbering programming paradigm is out of the question.

   <b>Alan&#39;s Unsolicited Advice:</b> Anytime you&#39;re involved with a project
   where you hear people saying &#34;we want to use &#39;X&#39; technology&#34; before they&#39;ve
   even thought about representing the problem they&#39;re trying to solve, look
   up for the cloud of doom, which floats nigh.  It&#39;s like hiring a carpenter,
   who, before he knows what you want to make, insists on using
   mortice-and-tenon joints.
