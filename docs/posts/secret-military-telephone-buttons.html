    <h1>Secret Military Telephone Buttons</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>It&#39;s the first of the new year, which means we ought to do something momentous
to mark the occasion, like a short piece about telephones. Why so much on
telephones lately? I think I&#39;m just a little burned out on software at the
moment and I need a vacation before I&#39;m excited to write about failed Microsoft
ventures again, but the time will surely come. Actually I just thought of a
good one I haven&#39;t mentioned before, so maybe that&#39;ll be next time.</p>
<p>Anyway, let&#39;s talk a little bit about phones, but not quite about long distance
carriers this time. Something you may or may not have noticed about the
carriers we&#39;ve discussed, perhaps depending on how interesting you find data
communications, is that we have covered only the physical layer. So far, there
has been no consideration of how switches communicated in order to set up and
tear down connections across multiple switches (i.e. long distance calls).
Don&#39;t worry, we will definitely get to this topic eventually and there&#39;s plenty
to be said about it. For the moment, though, I want to take a look at just one
little corner of the topic, and that&#39;s multifrequency tone systems.</p>
<p>Most of us are at least peripherally familiar with the term &#34;dual-tone
multifrequency&#34; or &#34;DTMF.&#34; AT&amp;T intended to promote Touch-Tone as the consumer
friendly name for this technology, but for various reasons (mainly AT&amp;T&#39;s
trademark) most independent manufacturers and service providers have stuck to
the term DTMF. DTMF is the most easily recognizable <em>signaling</em> method in the
telephone system: it is used to communicate digital data over phone lines, but
generally only for &#34;meta&#34; purposes such as connection setup (i.e. dialed
digits). An interesting thing about DTMF that makes it rather recognizable is
that it is <em>in-band,</em> meaning that the signals are sent over the same audio
link as the phone call itself... and if your telephone does not mute during
DTMF (some do but most do not), you can just hear those tones.</p>
<p>Or, really, I should say: if your phone just makes the beep boop noises for fun
pretend purposes, like cellphones, which often emit DTMF tones during dialing
even though the cellular network uses entirely on-hook dialing and DTMF is not
actually used as part of call setup. But that&#39;s a topic for another day.</p>
<p>DTMF is not the first multi-frequency signaling scheme. It is directly based on
an earlier system called, confusingly, multifrequency or MF. While DTMF and MF
have very similar names, they are not compatible, and were designed for
separate purposes.</p>
<p>MF signaling was designed for call setup between switches, mostly for
long-distance calling. Whenever a call requires a tandem switch, so say you
call another city, your telephone switch needs to connect you to a trunk on a
tandem switch but also inform the tandem switch of where you intend to call.
Historically this was achieved by operators just talking to each other over the
trunk before connecting it to your local loop, but in the era of direct dialing
an automated method was needed. Several different techniques were developed,
but MF was the most common for long-distance calling in the early direct dial
era.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about MF, though, is that it was put into place in a time
period in which some cities had direct long distance dialing but others did
not.  As a result, someone might be talking to an operator in order to set up a
call to a city with direct dial. This problem actually wasn&#39;t a new one, the
very earliest direct dialing implementations routinely ran into this issue, and
so it became common for operators switchboards to include a telephone dial
mounted at each operator position. The telephone dial allowed the operator to
dial for a customer, and was especially important when connecting someone into
a direct dial service area.</p>
<p>MF took the same approach, and so one could say that there were two distinct
modes for MF: in machine-to-machine operation, a telephone switch automatically
sent a series of MF tones after opening a trunk, mainly to forward the dialed
number to the next switch in the series. At the same time, many operators had
MF keypads at their positions that allowed them to &#34;dial&#34; to a remote switch
by hand. The circuitry that implemented these keypads turned more or less
directly into the DTMF keypads we see on phones today.</p>
<p>Like DTMF, MF worked by sending a pair of two frequencies [1]. The frequencies
were selected from the pool of 700, 900, 1100, 1300, 1500, and 1700Hz. That&#39;s
six frequencies, and it is required that two frequencies always be used, so the
number of possible symbol is 6c2 or 15. Of course we have the ten digits, 0-9,
but what about the other five? The additional five possibilities were used for
control symbols. For reasons that are obscure to me, the names selected for
the control symbols were Key Pulse or KP and Start or ST. Confusingly, KP
and ST each had multiple versions and were labeled differently by different
equipment. The closest thing to a universal rule would be to say that MF could
express the symbols 0-9, KP1-KP2, and ST1-ST3.</p>
<p>Part of the reason that the labeling of the symbols was inconsistent is that
their usage was somewhat inconsistent from switch to switch. Generally
speaking, an operator would connect to a trunk and then press KP1, the number
to be called, and then ST1. KP1 indicated to the far-side switch that it should
set up for an incoming connection (e.g. by assigning a sending unit or other
actions depending on the type of switch), while ST1 indicated that dialing was
complete. Most of the time telephone switches used other means (digit-matching
based on &#34;dial plans&#34;) to determine when dialing was complete, but since tandem
switches handled international calls MF was designed to gracefully handle
arbitrary length phone numbers (due to both variance between countries and the
bizarre choice of some countries to use variable-length phone numbers).</p>
<p>The additional KP and ST symbols had different applications but were most often
used to send &#34;additional information&#34; to the far side switch, in which case the
use of one of the control symbols differentiated the extra digits (e.g. an
account number) from the phone number.</p>
<p>MF keypads were conventionally three columns, two columns of digits (vertically
arranged) and one of control symbols on the right.</p>
<p>This is all a time to interject a quick note: the history of MF signaling turns
out to be surprisingly obscure. I had been generally aware of it for years, I&#39;m
not sure why, but when I went to read the details I was surprised by... how few
details there are. Different sources online conflict about basic facts (for
example, Wikipedia lists 6 frequencies which is consistent with the keypad I
have seen and the set of symbols, but a 1960 BSTJ overview article says there
were only five...). So far as I can tell, MF was never formally described in
BSTJ or any other technical journal, and I can&#39;t find any BSPs describing the
components. I suspect that MF was an unusually loose standard for the telephone
system, and that the MF implementation on different switches sometimes varied
significantly. This is not entirely surprising since the use of MF spanned from
manual exchanges to modern digital exchanges (it is said to still be in use in
some areas today, although I am not aware of any examples), covering around 80
years of telephone history.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t really intend to go into so much detail on MF here, but it&#39;s useful to
understand my main topic: DTMF. MF signaling went into use by the late 1940s
(date unclear for the reasons I just discussed), and by 1960 was considered a
main contender for AT&amp;T&#39;s goal of introducing digital signaling not just
between switches but also from the subscriber to the switch [2]. A few years
later, AT&amp;T introduced Touch-Tone or DTMF dialing. Unsurprisingly, DTMF is
really just MF with some problems solved.</p>
<p>MF posed a few challenges for use with subscriber equipment. The biggest was
the simple placement of the frequencies. The consistent 200 MHZ separation
meant that certain tones were subject to harmonics and other intermodulation
products from other tones, requiring high signal quality for reliable decoding.
That wasn&#39;t much of a problem on toll circuits which were already maintained to
a high standard, but local loops were routinely expected to work despite very
poor quality, and there was a huge variety of different equipment in use on
local loops, some of which was very old and easily picked up spurious noise.</p>
<p>Worse, the MF frequencies were placed in a range that was fairly prominent in
human speech. This resulted in a high risk that a person talking would be
recognized by an MF decoder as a symbol, which could create all kind of
headache. This wasn&#39;t really a problem for MF because MF keypads were designed
to disconnect the subscriber when digits were pressed. DTMF, though, was
intended to be simpler to implement and convenient to use while in a call,
which made it challenging to figure out how to disconnect or &#34;mute&#34; both
parties during DTMF signaling.</p>
<p>To address these issues, a whole new frequency plan was devised for DTMF. The
numbers and combinations all seem a bit odd, but were chosen to avoid any kind
of potential intermodulation artifacts that would be within the sensitivity
range of the decoder. DTMF consisted of <em>eight</em> frequencies, which were
organized differently, into a four by four grid. A grid layout was used, in
which there is one set of &#34;low&#34; frequencies and one set of &#34;high&#34; frequencies
and &#34;low&#34; was never mixed with &#34;low&#34; and vice versa, because it allowed much
tighter planning of the harmonics that would result from mixing the
frequencies.</p>
<p>So, we can describe DTMF this way: there are four rows and four columns. The
four rows are assigned 697, 770, 852, and 941 Hz, while the four columns are
1209, 1336, 1477, and 1633 Hz. Each digit consists of one row frequency and
one column frequency, and they&#39;re laid out the same way as the keypad.</p>
<p>Wait a minute... four rows, four <em>columns</em>?</p>
<p>DTMF obviously needed to include the digits 0-9. Some effort was put into
selecting the other available symbols, and for various reasons * and # were
chosen as complements to the digits (likely owing to their common use in
typewritten accounting and other business documents at the time). That makes
up 12 symbols, the first three columns. The fourth column, intended mostly for
machine-to-machine applications [3], was labeled A, B, C, and D.</p>
<p>Ever since, DTMF has featured the mysterious symbols A-D, and they have seen
virtually no use. It is fairly clear to me that they were only included
originally because DTMF was based directly on MF and so tried to preserve the
larger set of control symbols and in general a similar symbol count. The
engineers likely envisioned DTMF taking over as a direct replacement for MF
signaling in switch-to-switch signaling, which did happen occasionally but
was not widespread as newer signaling methods were starting to dominate by
the time DTMF was the norm. Instead, they&#39;re essentially vestigial.</p>
<p>One group of people which would be generally aware of the existence of A-D are
amateur radio operators, as the DTMF encoders in radios almost always provide a
full 4x4 keypad and it is somewhat common for A-D to be used for controlling
telephone patches---once the telephone patch is connected, 0-9, *, and # will
be relayed directly to the phone network, A-D provide an opportunity for four
symbols that are reserved for the patch itself to respond to.</p>
<p>Another group of people to which this would be familiar is those in the
military from roughly the &#39;70s to the &#39;90s, during the period of widespread
use of AUTOVON. While AUTOVON was mostly the same as the normal telephone
network but reserved for military use, it introduced one major feature that
the public telephone system lacked: a precedence, or priority system.</p>
<p>Normally dialed AUTOVON calls were placed at &#34;routine&#34; priority, but
&#34;priority,&#34; &#34;immediate,&#34; &#34;flash,&#34; and &#34;flash override&#34; were successively higher
precedence levels reserved for successively more important levels of military
command and control. While it is not exactly true, it is almost true, and
certainly very fun to say, that AUTOVON telephones feature a button that only
the President of the United States is allowed to press. The Flash Override or
FO button was mostly reserved for use by the national command authority in
order to invoke a nuclear attack, and as you would imagine would result in
AUTOVON switches abruptly terminating any other call as necessary to make
trunks available.</p>
<p>AUTOVON needed some way for telephones to indicate to the switch what the
priority of the call was, and so it was obvious to relabel the A, B, C, and D
DTMF buttons as P, I, F, and FO respectively. AUTOVON phones thus feature a
full 4x4 keypad, with the rightmost column typically in red and used to prefix
dialed calls with a precedence level. Every once in a while I have thought
about buying one of these phones to use with my home PABX but they tend to be
remarkably expensive... I think maybe restorers of military equipment are
holding up prices.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s what I wanted to tell you: the military has four extra telephone
buttons that they don&#39;t tell us about. Kinda makes you take the X-files a
little more seriously, huh?</p>
<p>In all serious, though, they both do and don&#39;t today. Newer military telephone
systems such as DSN and the various secure VoIP systems usually preserve a
precedence feature but offer it using less interesting methods. Sometimes it&#39;s
by prefixing dialing with a numeric code, sometimes via feature line keys, but
not by secret DTMF symbols.</p>
<p>[1] This was technically referred to as a &#34;spurt&#34; of MF, a term which I am
refusing to use because of my delicate sensibilities.</p>
<p>[2] One could argue that pulse dialing was &#34;digital,&#34; but because it relied on
the telephone interrupting the loop current it was not really &#34;in-band&#34; in the
modern sense and so could not readily be relayed across trunks. Much of the
desire for a digital subscriber signaling system was for automated phone
systems, which could never receive pulses since they were &#34;confined&#34; to the
local loop. Nonetheless DTMF was also useful for the telephone system itself
and enabled much more flexible network architectures, especially related to
remote switches and line concentrators, since DTMF dialing could be decoded
by equipment &#34;upstream&#34; from wherever the phone line terminated without any
extra signaling equipment needed to &#34;forward&#34; the pulses.</p>
<p>[3] This might be a little odd from the modern perspective but by the &#39;60s
machine-to-machine telephony using very simple encodings was becoming very
popular... at least in the eyes of the telephone company, although not always
the public. AT&amp;T was very supportive of the concept of telephones which read
punched cards and emitted the card contents as DTMF. In practice this ended up
being mostly used as a whimsical speed-dial, but it was widely advertised for
uses like semi-automated delivery of mail orders (keypunch them in the field,
say going door to door, and then call an electromechanical order taking system
and feed them all through your phone) and did see those types of use for some
time.</p>
