<p id="speakable-summary">A Waymo robotaxi struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica on January 23, according to the company. Waymo told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that the child — whose age and identity are not currently public — sustained minor injuries.</p>

<p>The NHTSA has opened an <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/?nhtsaId=PE26001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investigation</a> into the accident, and Waymo said in a <a href="https://waymo.com/blog/2026/01/a-commitment-to-transparency-and-road-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that it “will cooperate fully with them throughout the process.” The National Transportation Safety Board <a href="https://x.com/NTSB_Newsroom/status/2016971702345892233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said Thursday afternoon</a> that it has also opened an investigation in coordination with the Santa Monica Police Department.</p>







<p>Waymo said its robotaxi struck the child at six miles per hour, after braking “hard” from around 17 miles per hour. The young pedestrian “suddenly entered the roadway from behind a tall SUV, moving directly into our vehicle’s path,” the company said in its blog post. Waymo said its vehicle “immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle.”</p>

<p>“Following contact, the pedestrian stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911. The vehicle remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene,” Waymo wrote in the post.</p>

<p>News of the crash comes as Waymo faces dual investigations into its robotaxis illegally passing school buses. The NHTSA opened a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/20/regulators-probe-waymo-after-its-robotaxi-drove-around-a-stopped-school-bus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">probe</a> into the problem in October shortly after the first report of the incident in Atlanta, Georgia, and the NTSB opened its own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/23/waymo-probed-by-national-transportation-safety-board-over-illegal-school-bus-behavior/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investigation</a> last week after around 20 incidents were reported in Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>According to the NHTSA, the accident occurred “within two blocks” of the elementary school “during normal school drop off hours.” The safety regulator said “there were other children, a crossing guard, and several double-parked vehicles in the vicinity.”</p>

<p>The NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation is investigating “whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.”</p>

<p>Waymo said in its blog post that its “peer-reviewed model” shows a “fully attentive human driver in this same situation would have made contact with the pedestrian at approximately 14 mph.” The company did not release a specific analysis of this crash.  </p>

<p><em>This story has been updated to include information about the National Transportation Safety Board’s investigation.</em></p>
