<p>Google is still reeling from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/google-cuts-12000-jobs-the-largest-layoff-in-the-companys-history/">biggest layoff</a> in company history last Friday. Earlier cost cuts over the past six months have resulted in several projects being shut down or deprioritized at Google, and it&#39;s hard to fire 12,000 people without some additional projects taking a hit. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/business/google-alphabet-layoffs.html?s=09">New York Times</a> has a report about which divisions are being hit the hardest, and a big one is Google&#39;s future OS development group, Fuchsia.</p>
<p>While the overall company cut 6 percent of its employees, the Times pointed out that Fuchsia saw an outsize 16 percent of the 400-person staff take a hit. While it&#39;s not clear what that means for the future of the division, the future of Fuchsia&#39;s division has never really been clear.</p>
<p>Fuchsia has been a continuous mystery inside Google since it first saw widespread press coverage <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/05/googles-fuchsia-smartphone-os-dumps-linux-has-a-wild-new-ui/">in 2017</a>. Google rarely officially talks about it, leaving mostly rumors and Github documentation for figuring out what&#39;s going on. The OS isn&#39;t a small project, though—it&#39;s not even based on Linux, opting instead to use a custom, in-house kernel, so Google really is building an entire OS from scratch. Google <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/google-launches-its-third-major-operating-system-fuchsia/">actually ships</a> the OS today to consumers in its Nest smart displays, where it replaced the older Cast OS. The in-place operating system swap was completely invisible to consumers compared to the old OS, came with zero benefits, and was never officially announced or promoted. There&#39;s not much you can do with it on a locked-down smart display, so even after shipping, Fuchsia is still a mystery.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The biggest questions surrounding Fuchsia are: &#34;Why does this exist, and what are its goals?&#34; Is Fuchsia an eventual replacement for Android or Chrome OS? Around 2018, when we first got <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/googles-fuchsia-os-on-the-pixelbook-it-works-it-actually-works/">Fuchsia running</a> on a Pixelbook, the source code documentation for the custom kernel said it &#34;targets modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors,&#34; which certainly made it sound like an Android and/or Chrome OS successor being built for flagship devices. That early codebase also included graphical user interfaces for PCs and phones, further driving home that this was a consumer OS. After Fuchsia got some initial publicity, it removed its public interface code.</p>
<p>2018 also saw a foundational <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-19/google-team-is-said-to-plot-android-successor-draw-skepticism#xj4y7vzkg">Bloomberg</a> report calling Fuchsia &#34;a successor to Android,&#34; and saying the team planned to launch on smart speakers in 2021 (which was spot on) and would later move into phones and laptops in 2023.  Even the name &#34;Fuchsia&#34; was a reference to Apple projects some members of the team had been involved with. &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taligent">Pink</a>&#34; was the codename for a canceled successor to classic Mac OS, and &#34;Purple&#34; was the codename for the iPhone OS. The color Fuchsia is a mix of pink and purple, so this all sounded very ambitious.</p>
