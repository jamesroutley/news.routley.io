     <h2>Chapter XXVII.</h2>
<p>“MY DEAR MR PIP:—</p>
<p>“I write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he is going to
London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed
to see you. He would call at Barnard’s Hotel Tuesday morning at nine o’clock,
when if not agreeable please leave word. Your poor sister is much the same as
when you left. We talk of you in the kitchen every night, and wonder what you
are saying and doing. If now considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for
the love of poor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from</p>
<p>“Your ever obliged, and affectionate servant,         “BIDDY.”</p>
<p>“P.S. He wishes me most particular to write <em>what larks</em>. He says you will
understand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him, even though
a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is a worthy, worthy man. I
have read him all, excepting only the last little sentence, and he wishes me
most particular to write again <em>what larks</em>.”</p>
<p>I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its
appointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings I looked
forward to Joe’s coming.</p>
<p>Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; with
considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of incongruity.
If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly would have paid
money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming to Barnard’s Inn, not to
Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall in Bentley Drummle’s way. I had
little objection to his being seen by Herbert or his father, for both of whom I
had a respect; but I had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by
Drummle, whom I held in contempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and
meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most
despise.</p>
<p>I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and
inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those wrestles with Barnard
proved to be. By this time, the rooms were vastly different from what I had
found them, and I enjoyed the honour of occupying a few prominent pages in the
books of a neighbouring upholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had
even started a boy in boots,—top boots,—in bondage and slavery to whom I might
have been said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of the
refuse of my washerwoman’s family), and had clothed him with a blue coat, canary
waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots already mentioned, I had
to find him a little to do and a great deal to eat; and with both of those
horrible requirements he haunted my existence.</p>
<p>This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday morning in
the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged for floorcloth,) and Herbert
suggested certain things for breakfast that he thought Joe would like. While I
felt sincerely obliged to him for being so interested and considerate, I had an
odd half-provoked sense of suspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see
<em>him</em>, he wouldn’t have been quite so brisk about it.</p>
<p>However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and I got up
early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and breakfast-table to assume
their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately the morning was drizzly, and an
angel could not have concealed the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears
outside the window, like some weak giant of a Sweep.</p>
<p>As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger pursuant
to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on the staircase. I knew it
was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming upstairs,—his state boots being always
too big for him,—and by the time it took him to read the names on the other
floors in the course of his ascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I
could hear his finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I
afterwards distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a
faint single rap, and Pepper—such was the compromising name of the avenging
boy—announced “Mr. Gargery!” I thought he never would have done wiping his feet,
and that I must have gone out to lift him off the mat, but at last he came in.</p>
<p>“Joe, how are you, Joe?”</p>
<p>“Pip, how AIR you, Pip?”</p>
<p>With his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put down on the
floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them straight up and down,
as if I had been the last-patented Pump.</p>
<p>“I am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.”</p>
<p>But Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird’s-nest with eggs in
it, wouldn’t hear of parting with that piece of property, and persisted in
standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.</p>
<p>“Which you have that growed,” said Joe, “and that swelled, and that
gentle-folked;” Joe considered a little before he discovered this word; “as to
be sure you are a honour to your king and country.”</p>
<p>“And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.”</p>
<p>“Thank God,” said Joe, “I’m ekerval to most. And your sister, she’s no worse
than she were. And Biddy, she’s ever right and ready. And all friends is no
backerder, if not no forarder. ’Ceptin Wopsle; he’s had a drop.”</p>
<p>All this time (still with both hands taking great care of the bird’s-nest), Joe
was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and round and round the flowered
pattern of my dressing-gown.</p>
<p>“Had a drop, Joe?”</p>
<p>“Why yes,” said Joe, lowering his voice, “he’s left the Church and went into the
playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him to London along with
me. And his wish were,” said Joe, getting the bird’s-nest under his left arm for
the moment, and groping in it for an egg with his right; “if no offence, as I
would ’and you that.”</p>
<p>I took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of a small
metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that very week, of
“the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown, whose unique performance
in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard has lately occasioned so great a
sensation in local dramatic circles.”</p>
<p>“Were you at his performance, Joe?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“I <em>were</em>,” said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.</p>
<p>“Was there a great sensation?”</p>
<p>“Why,” said Joe, “yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel. Partickler
when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir, whether it were
calc’lated to keep a man up to his work with a good hart, to be continiwally
cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with “Amen!” A man may have had a
misfortun’ and been in the Church,” said Joe, lowering his voice to an
argumentative and feeling tone, “but that is no reason why you should put him
out at such a time. Which I meantersay, if the ghost of a man’s own father
cannot be allowed to claim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his
mourning ’at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black
feathers brings it off, try to keep it on how you may.”</p>
<p>A ghost-seeing effect in Joe’s own countenance informed me that Herbert had
entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his hand; but Joe
backed from it, and held on by the bird’s-nest.</p>
<p>“Your servant, Sir,” said Joe, “which I hope as you and Pip”—here his eye fell
on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so plainly denoted an
intention to make that young gentleman one of the family, that I frowned it down
and confused him more—“I meantersay, you two gentlemen,—which I hope as you get
your elths in this close spot? For the present may be a werry good inn,
according to London opinions,” said Joe, confidentially, “and I believe its
character do stand it; but I wouldn’t keep a pig in it myself,—not in the case
that I wished him to fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him.”</p>
<p>Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwelling-place, and
having incidentally shown this tendency to call me “sir,” Joe, being invited to
sit down to table, looked all round the room for a suitable spot on which to
deposit his hat,—as if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature
that it could find a resting place,—and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner
of the chimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.</p>
<p>“Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?” asked Herbert, who always presided of
a morning.</p>
<p>“Thankee, Sir,” said Joe, stiff from head to foot, “I’ll take whichever is most
agreeable to yourself.”</p>
<p>“What do you say to coffee?”</p>
<p>“Thankee, Sir,” returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal, “since you
<em>are</em> so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy to your own
opinions. But don’t you never find it a little ’eating?”</p>
<p>“Say tea then,” said Herbert, pouring it out.</p>
<p>Here Joe’s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of his chair and
picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it were an absolute
point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon.</p>
<p>“When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?”</p>
<p>“Were it yesterday afternoon?” said Joe, after coughing behind his hand, as if
he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came. “No it were not. Yes
it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon” (with an appearance of mingled
wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).</p>
<p>“Have you seen anything of London yet?”</p>
<p>“Why, yes, Sir,” said Joe, “me and Wopsle went off straight to look at the
Blacking Ware’us. But we didn’t find that it come up to its likeness in the red
bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,” added Joe, in an explanatory
manner, “as it is there drawd too architectooralooral.”</p>
<p>I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily expressive to my
mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect Chorus, but for his
attention being providentially attracted by his hat, which was toppling. Indeed,
it demanded from him a constant attention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very
like that exacted by wicket-keeping. He made extraordinary play with it, and
showed the greatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as it
dropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humouring it in
various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on
the wall, before he felt it safe to close with it; finally splashing it into the
slop-basin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it.</p>
<p>As to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to reflect
upon,—insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself to that extent,
before he could consider himself full dressed? Why should he suppose it
necessary to be purified by suffering for his holiday clothes? Then he fell into
such unaccountable fits of meditation, with his fork midway between his plate
and his mouth; had his eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted
with such remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more
than he ate, and pretended that he hadn’t dropped it; that I was heartily glad
when Herbert left us for the City.</p>
<p>I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my
fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have been easier with
me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper with him; in which condition he
heaped coals of fire on my head.</p>
<p>“Us two being now alone, sir,”—began Joe.</p>
<p>“Joe,” I interrupted, pettishly, “how can you call me, sir?”</p>
<p>Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach.
Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars were, I was conscious
of a sort of dignity in the look.</p>
<p>“Us two being now alone,” resumed Joe, “and me having the intentions and
abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now conclude—leastways begin—to
mention what have led to my having had the present honour. For was it not,” said
Joe, with his old air of lucid exposition, “that my only wish were to be useful
to you, I should not have had the honour of breaking wittles in the company and
abode of gentlemen.”</p>
<p>I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance against
this tone.</p>
<p>“Well, sir,” pursued Joe, “this is how it were. I were at the Bargemen t’other
night, Pip;”—whenever he subsided into affection, he called me Pip, and whenever
he relapsed into politeness he called me sir; “when there come up in his
shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which that same identical,” said Joe, going down a new
track, “do comb my ’air the wrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and
down town as it were him which ever had your infant companionation and were
looked upon as a playfellow by yourself.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense. It was you, Joe.”</p>
<p>“Which I fully believed it were, Pip,” said Joe, slightly tossing his head,
“though it signify little now, sir. Well, Pip; this same identical, which his
manners is given to blusterous, come to me at the Bargemen (wot a pipe and a
pint of beer do give refreshment to the workingman, sir, and do not over
stimilate), and his word were, ‘Joseph, Miss Havisham she wish to speak to
you.’”</p>
<p>“Miss Havisham, Joe?”</p>
<p>“‘She wish,’ were Pumblechook’s word, ‘to speak to you.’” Joe sat and rolled his
eyes at the ceiling.</p>
<p>“Yes, Joe? Go on, please.”</p>
<p>“Next day, sir,” said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off, “having
cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.”</p>
<p>“Miss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?”</p>
<p>“Which I say, sir,” replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if he were
making his will, “Miss A., or otherways Havisham. Her expression air then as
follering: ‘Mr. Gargery. You air in correspondence with Mr. Pip?’ Having had a
letter from you, I were able to say ‘I am.’ (When I married your sister, sir, I
said ‘I will;’ and when I answered your friend, Pip, I said ‘I am.’) ‘Would you
tell him, then,’ said she, ‘that which Estella has come home and would be glad
to see him.’”</p>
<p>I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause of its firing
may have been my consciousness that if I had known his errand, I should have
given him more encouragement.</p>
<p>“Biddy,” pursued Joe, “when I got home and asked her fur to write the message to
you, a little hung back. Biddy says, ‘I know he will be very glad to have it by
word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see him, go!’ I have now
concluded, sir,” said Joe, rising from his chair, “and, Pip, I wish you ever
well and ever prospering to a greater and a greater height.”</p>
<p>“But you are not going now, Joe?”</p>
<p>“Yes I am,” said Joe.</p>
<p>“But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?”</p>
<p>“No I am not,” said Joe.</p>
<p>Our eyes met, and all the “Sir” melted out of that manly heart as he gave me his
hand.</p>
<p>“Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded together, as I
may say, and one man’s a blacksmith, and one’s a whitesmith, and one’s a
goldsmith, and one’s a coppersmith. Diwisions among such must come, and must be
met as they come. If there’s been any fault at all to-day, it’s mine. You and me
is not two figures to be together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is
private, and beknown, and understood among friends. It ain’t that I am proud,
but that I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these clothes.
I’m wrong in these clothes. I’m wrong out of the forge, the kitchen, or off th’
meshes. You won’t find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge
dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even my pipe. You won’t find half so much
fault in me if, supposing as you should ever wish to see me, you come and put
your head in at the forge window and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old
anvil, in the old burnt apron, sticking to the old work. I’m awful dull, but I
hope I’ve beat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD bless
you, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!”</p>
<p>I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in him. The
fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he spoke these words
than it could come in its way in Heaven. He touched me gently on the forehead,
and went out. As soon as I could recover myself sufficiently, I hurried out
after him and looked for him in the neighbouring streets; but he was gone.</p>
