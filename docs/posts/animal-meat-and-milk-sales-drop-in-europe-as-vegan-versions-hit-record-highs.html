<p>The Good Food Institute Europe (GFI Europe) reports that sales of plant-based foods across 13 European nations amounted to €5.7 billion in 2022.</p>
<p>The figure represents a 22 percent increase since 2020, with vegan meat alternatives being a major contributor. Alongside, dairy-free cheese and vegan seafood products saw significant growth from increased consumer demand. </p>
<p>Comparatively, some animal protein categories experienced reduced sales figures.</p>
<p>Countries included in the sales analyses were Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/germany-eats-less-meat/">Germany</a>, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, and the UK.</p>

<h3 id="h-vegan-sales-rise-while-animal-protein-falls"><strong>Vegan sales rise while animal protein falls</strong></h3>
<p>In a <a href="https://gfieurope.org/market-insights-on-european-plant-based-sales-2020-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">detailed report</a>, GFI Europe reveals that vegan meat products saw a 21 percent increase in unit sales from 2020 to 2022. Plant milk garnered a 20 percent uptick. </p>
<p>During the same period, animal-based meat and milk sales dropped by eight and nine percent, respectively. </p>
<p>Nondairy cheese also enjoyed vast growth. As the market diversified to include more vegan cheese brands and products than ever before, the sector reached a total market value of €144 million.</p>
<p>Representing a 102 percent increase in sales between 2020 and 2022, it eclipsed conventional cheese’s growth by more than 10 times.</p>
<p>Similarly, unit sales for plant-based yogurt increased by 16 percent, while conventional yogurt’s fell by four.</p>
<h3>Plant-based ‘seafood’ making waves</h3>
<p>Some of the most significant figures came from the <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/food/plant-based-salmon-fillet/">alternative seafood</a> sector, which saw its unit sales grow by 343 percent in the two-year period.</p>
<p>However, the vegan seafood market remains – according to GFI Europe – the least developed area of plant-based food. Despite vast growth, only €43 million in sales were recorded in 2022. For comparison, plant milk garnered €2.21 billion last year alone.</p>
<p>Increased sales were also identified across the plant-based cream, ice cream, and meal product categories. The latter saw a 79 percent rise in sales. </p>
<h3 id="h-a-more-sustainable-economy">A more sustainable economy?</h3>
<p>Despite tangible, and in some cases, gargantuan, growth across the plant-based food sector, GFI Europe says there is still vast space for improvement.</p>
<p>“These figures show Europe’s appetite for plant-based foods is continuing to grow – but these sustainable options still represent a tiny proportion of the market,” Carlotte Lucas, senior corporate engagement manager at GFI Europe, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“European companies and governments have a critical role to play in supporting consumers to make more sustainable choices. Companies must continue investing in product innovation to develop delicious and affordable plant-based options. </p>
<p>“And governments must invest in the research and infrastructure we need to reduce prices and improve the quality of plant-based options, in order to deliver on their climate targets and enhance food security.”</p>
<p>Plant-based foods are widely recommended to stem the progression of the <a href="https://plantbasednews.org/news/economics/plant-based-food-best-climate-investment-new-report/">climate crisis</a>. In particular, vegan meat products are suggested as a positive swap for animal-based protein. The former is said to create around 90 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions during production while using up to <a href="https://css.umich.edu/publications/research-publications/beyond-meats-beyond-burger-life-cycle-assessment-detailed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">93 percent less land and 99 percent less water</a>. </p>
<p>Moreover, governments have been warned that a <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">failure to address meat production</a> as a serious contributor to the climate crisis will make it “impossible” for their countries to fulfil Paris Agreement pledges.</p>
