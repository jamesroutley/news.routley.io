    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>The LiPo Prismatic</h3><p>Engineers who design rechargeable electronics–everything from wireless earbuds to cars–need to pack as much lithium-ion power into as little space as possible. The lithium polymer battery packet has become the standard in these applications, but it’s also fragile and requires careful handling to avoid catastrophic problems. CT inspection is <a href="https://contact.lumafield.com/webinar-batteries-industrial-ct" target="_blank">increasingly used in the battery industry</a> to catch tiny defects and signs of damage before they turn into explosive failures.</p><p><a href="https://app.lumafield.com/project/ef5b0edb-10f8-4e3c-8dd1-9758f8efdff4">Explore scan in Voyager</a></p></div><div><p>Slicing in from the edge, we can get a clear view of the battery pack’s construction. Layers of lithium polymer sit between separators, the thin sections that stick up slightly higher than the rest. As the battery charges and discharges, it heats up and tends to cause the separators to delaminate from the polymer layers. Here, we see some delamination around the bend.</p><p>The positive electrode on this battery is a tab of aluminum foil. The negative electrode is copper; its yellow color in our visualization means it’s denser than the other materials in the battery. Perforations minimize battery expansion during cycling, and glue spots hold the battery’s foil wrapper together.</p><p>The polymer electrolyte can be seen in its full glory by melting away the lower-density materials in our CT visualization, revealing lithium layers that are 100 to 150 microns thick. Lithium polymer electrolytes allow for high energy densities and fast discharges, but the material is also very volatile and known to swell–which in turn can damage the battery and lead to cascading failures.</p><p><a href="https://app.lumafield.com/project/ef5b0edb-10f8-4e3c-8dd1-9758f8efdff4">Explore scan in Voyager</a></p></div></div>
