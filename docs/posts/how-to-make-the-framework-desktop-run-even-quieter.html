    <h1>How to make the Framework Desktop run even quieter</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Not so long ago, the compact, small form factor PC segment witnessed a significant refreshment with the launch of the <a href="https://frame.work/">Framework</a> desktop PC. If you&#39;ve missed it and are wondering why this mini-PC is considered so special, it&#39;s because it was the first desktop PC to utilise the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/laptop/ryzen/ai-300-series/amd-ryzen-ai-max-385.html">AMD Ryzen AI Max APU</a>, a processor previously exclusive to laptops.</p>
<p>The AMD Ryzen AI Max processor stands out for its exceptional speed and integrated graphics performance, frequently surprising users with its gaming capabilities, even on demanding titles. Users often highlight its powerful integrated GPU, which can leverage a massive memory pool (up to 96GB for AI tasks), allowing it to efficiently handle complex AI and deep learning workloads. The raw performance delivered by this chip makes it a worthwhile choice for intensive tasks and creative workflows.</p>
<p>As a collaborator and partner on the Framework Desktop mini-PC project, our first steps involved integrating our <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x15-pwm">NF-A12x25</a> fan and a fan duct. This way, we could significantly reduce system noise levels while ensuring safe operating temperatures – you can <a href="https://noctua.at/en/noctua-cooling-enhancements-to-framework-desktop">read more about this here</a>. But can the Framework Desktop be made even quieter? We wanted to leave no stone unturned to find out, so we took it a step further by trying to integrate our signature Noctua fan grill design that debuted on the <a href="https://noctua.at/en/seasonic-prime-tx-1600-noctua-edition">Seasonic Prime TX-1600 Noctua Edition power supply</a>.</p>

<p>It must be noted that customer safety and EMC requirements for the mini PC, a standalone electrical item, differ from those for hardware components (such as the PSU) designed to be inside a PC case. The safety standard suggests that ventilation openings on case side panels need to be less than 5mm in diameter. To comply with safety regulations, we created an updated version of the original fan grille as implemented on the <a href="https://noctua.at/en/seasonic-prime-tx-1600-noctua-edition">Seasonic Prime TX 1600 Noctua Edition</a> power supply featuring more struts and a smaller opening size, ensuring full adherence to these standards. To complement the new grille design, we have also designed a custom, funnel shaped fan duct that makes maximum use of the outermost openings of the custom side panel.</p>

<p>In combination, the custom side panel and duct design provided a massive noise reduction compared to the stock configuration, particularly in lower fan speed ranges. We have measured around 7 dB(A) lower noise levels at around 50% fan speed, and up to 5 dB(A) lower at higher fan speeds, when compared at the same APU operating temperature.</p>

<p>While the custom side panel with our signature Noctua grill as well as the custom fan duct are not slated for mass production at this point, we are more than happy to share the 3D CAD files for everyone who is looking to make their Framework Desktop run even quieter.</p>
<p>Both the custom side panel and the customised fan ductare available to download at <a href="https://www.printables.com/@Noctua/models">Printables.com</a> for you to 3D-print at home:</p>

</ul>
<p>Fortunately, the quality of 3D printing technologies has advanced so much that you can end up with a nice, clean side panel, which will additionally optimise the sound profile, or bring your APU temperatures down significantly.</p>

<p>In addition to redesigning and testing the Noctua fan grill, we also evaluated various other scenarios. These included replacing the NF-A12x25 with its G2 variant and incorporating an additional 8cm fan for exhaust purposes. The findings of these tests may prove surprising. The additional <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a8-pwm">NF-A8 PWM</a> fan, which was added as an exhaust fan at the front of the case, yielded slightly lower temperatures, but at the expense of extra noise emission, so it’s not a setup that we would recommend from a performance-to-noise efficiency point of view.</p>

<p>While upgrading to an <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x25-g2-pwm">NF-A12x25 G2</a> does provide some acoustical benefits compared to the stock setup (around 1 to 1.5 dB(A) lower noise levels at the same temperatures), its maximum speed is limited to 1800 RPM, so it cannot match the performance headroom of the 2400 RPM HS-PWM version of the NF-A12x25 that is supplied with the Framework Desktop PC. This high-speed version of the „G1“ fan is a safeguard that ensures the system can maintain full performance in worst-case conditions with high ambient temperatures. In other words, we would only recommend upgrading to the <a href="https://noctua.at/en/nf-a12x25-g2-pwm">NF-A12x25 G2</a> if you seek to lower noise levels as much as possible and if you are willing to sacrifice the maximum performance headroom in worst-case scenarios that the G1 HS-PWM fan provides.</p>

<p>In summary, after a lot of simulation, experimenting and testing, we can conclude that not all tweaks to the <a href="https://frame.work/si/en/desktop">Framework Desktop’s</a> cooling setup make sense. However, if you have access to a 3D printer, swapping the stock side panel and fan duct for the custom designed ones can help to make your unit run significantly quieter.</p>
