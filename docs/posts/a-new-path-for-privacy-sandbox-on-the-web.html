                  We developed the Privacy Sandbox with the goal of finding innovative solutions
                  that meaningfully improve online privacy while preserving an ad-supported internet
                  that supports a vibrant ecosystem of publishers, connects businesses with
                  customers, and offers all of us free access to a wide range of content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout this process, we’ve received feedback from a wide variety of
                  stakeholders, including regulators like the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority
                  (CMA) and Information Commissioner&#39;s Office (ICO), publishers, web developers and
                  standards groups, civil society, and participants in the advertising industry.
                  This feedback has helped us craft solutions that aim to support a competitive and
                  thriving marketplace that works for publishers and advertisers, and encourage the
                  adoption of privacy-enhancing technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Early testing from ad tech companies,
                  <a href="https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/15189422" target="_blank">
                    <span><u>including Google</u></span></a>, has indicated that the Privacy Sandbox APIs have the potential to achieve these
                  outcomes. And we expect that overall performance using Privacy Sandbox APIs will
                  <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/news/learnings-from-privacy-sandbox-testing/" target="_blank">
                    <span><u>improve</u></span></a>
                  over time as industry adoption increases. At the same time, we recognize this
                  transition requires significant work by many participants and will have an impact
                  on publishers, advertisers, and everyone involved in online advertising.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In light of this, we are proposing an updated approach that elevates user choice.
                  Instead of deprecating third-party cookies, we would introduce a new experience in
                  Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web
                  browsing, and they’d be able to adjust that choice at any time. We&#39;re discussing
                  this new path with regulators, and will engage with the industry as we roll this
                  out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As this moves forward, it remains important for developers to have
                  privacy-preserving alternatives. We&#39;ll continue to make the Privacy Sandbox APIs
                  available and invest in them to further improve privacy and utility. We also
                  intend to offer additional privacy controls, so we plan to introduce
                  <a href="https://developers.google.com/privacy-sandbox/protections/ip-protection" target="_blank">
                    <span><u>IP Protection</u></span></a>
                  into Chrome&#39;s Incognito mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We’re grateful to all the organizations and individuals who have worked with us
                  over the last four years to develop, test and adopt the Privacy Sandbox. And as we
                  finalize this approach, we’ll continue to consult with the CMA, ICO and other
                  regulators globally. We look forward to continued collaboration with the ecosystem
                  on the next phase of the journey to a more private web.<br/>
