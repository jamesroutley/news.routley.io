    <h1>China&#39;s Clinical Trial Boom</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>In January, the Chinese company Deepseek released a reasoning AI model, called R1, that </span><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41999151" rel="">performs comparably</a><span> to OpenAI&#39;s GPT-4o Turbo model on certain AI benchmarks but was developed with fewer resources at a much lower cost. Marc Andreessen called it “one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I’ve ever seen,” even as NVIDIA’s stock plummeted by 17 percent — the largest ever one-day loss for a U.S. company.</span></p><p><span>While China’s AI competitiveness may have blindsided the tech world, the </span><a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/united-states-cannot-afford-disarray-china-strengthens-its-biopharmaceutical-industry" rel="">pharmaceutical industry</a><span> has already had quite a few “</span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/the-drug-industry-is-having-its-own-deepseek-moment-68589d70" rel="">DeepSeek Moments</a><span>” of its own. </span></p><p><span>About </span><a href="https://www.biospace.com/business/big-pharma-rushes-to-china-for-deal-prospecting-despite-regulatory-uncertainty" rel="">one-fourth of all clinical trials</a><span> and early drug development now happens in China. Large pharmaceutical companies in-license about a third of their experimental molecules from Chinese laboratories (meaning they purchase the rights to molecules developed by other research groups rather than discover them in-house), according to </span><a href="https://www.stifel.com/newsletters/investmentbanking/bal/marketing/healthcare/biopharma_timopler/2025/biopharmamarketupdate_outlook_2025.pdf" rel="">a report</a><span> by Stifel. Just a couple of years ago, this number was about 10 percent.</span></p><p><span>&#34;Ten years ago, a major [pharmaceutical company] seeking their next breakthrough molecule would have turned to an American or European biotech,” writes biotechnologist </span><a href="https://atelfo.github.io/2024/12/20/will-all-our-drugs-come-from-china.html" rel="">Alex Telford</a><span>. “Today, they’re just as likely to license a molecule from a Chinese company. Chinese companies will often run the phase I trial in China for cheap, then flip it to a Western [pharmaceutical company] to run the expensive US trials and bring the drug to market.&#34;</span></p><p>The reason for this shift is due, in part, to policy. Chinese regulators have passed reforms that lower barriers to market entry and streamline approvals. Those reforms could hold lessons for U.S. regulators hoping to speed up drug development, too.</p><p><span>Impacts from China’s reforms can be seen by looking at clinical trial enrollment data.</span><span> Such data is illuminating because enrollment numbers offer a measure of the administrative burden placed on new treatments as they move from concept to real-world testing. Patent filings and R&amp;D budgets suggest how much a region invests in discovery, but clinical trial activity shows how projects navigate bureaucratic landscapes. By analyzing how enrollment rates respond to changes in policy, funding, and disease targets, we can see which approaches most effectively accelerate pharmaceutical innovation. Here’s what the data shows. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png" width="1240" height="1232" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1232,&#34;width&#34;:1240,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:230467,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:&#34;https://www.asimov.press/i/161109218?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png&#34;,&#34;isProcessing&#34;:false,&#34;align&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd8b6b2c5-4673-430e-9412-a5f4c94eb7f3_1240x1232.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>In the early 2010s, the number of clinical trials performed by American companies increased steadily but then leveled out at about 1,900 studies each year.

Drugs that qualify for priority review often address a critical, unmet clinical need, allowing them to go through an accelerated evaluation timeline.</p><p><span>In 2017, the NMPA (China’s drug regulator) also launched an “implied license” policy, which automatically authorizes a clinical trial if regulators voice no objections within 60 days. That same year, China joined the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) and updated its rules to accept overseas clinical trial data, reducing the need to repeat entire studies within China. This means that companies no longer need to repeat full trials in China if high-quality foreign results exist. Amgen’s </span><a href="https://www.amgen.cn/en/media/amgen-denosumab.html" rel="">XGEVA</a><span>, a medication used to treat bone cancer, was approved in 2019 without further testing requirements based on a global Phase 2 study that included no clinical trial sites in China.

Nor has the increased number of Chinese trials come at the expense of fewer enrollments.</p><p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.iqvia.com/insights/the-iqvia-institute/reports-and-publications/reports/global-trends-in-r-and-d-2023" rel="">2023 IQVIA report</a><span> notes that industry-wide trial complexity declined after pandemic-era peaks, favoring numerous smaller studies. This trend is evident in the U.S. data, where over three-quarters of recent trials now enroll fewer than 100 participants. The result is that many American trials are smaller and underpowered, sometimes due to difficulties in recruiting participants.
