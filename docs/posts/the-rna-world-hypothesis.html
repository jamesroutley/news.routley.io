    <h1>The RNA World Hypothesis</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-jigconfig="allHeadingLevels: [&#39;h2&#39;],smoothScroll: false" itemprop="text"><p>To fully understand the processes occurring in present-day living cells, we need to consider how they arose in evolution. The most fundamental of all such problems is the <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5163/">expression</a> of hereditary information, which today requires extraordinarily <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5014/">complex</a> machinery and proceeds from <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/">DNA</a> to <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5688/">protein</a> through an <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/">RNA</a> intermediate. How did this machinery arise? One view is that an <i>RNA world</i> existed on Earth before modern cells arose (<a href="https://danluu.com/books/NBK26876/figure/A1120/?report=objectonly" target="object" rid-figpopup="figA1120" rid-ob="figobA1120">Figure 6-91</a>). According to this hypothesis, RNA stored both genetic information and catalyzed the chemical reactions in primitive cells. Only later in evolutionary time did DNA take over as the genetic material and proteins become the major <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4922/">catalyst</a> and structural component of cells. If this idea is correct, then the transition out of the RNA world was never complete; as we have seen in this chapter, RNA still catalyzes several fundamental reactions in modern-day cells, which can be viewed as molecular fossils of an earlier world.

We will see that several of the more surprising features of modern-day cells, such as the <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5754/">ribosome</a> and the pre-<a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5496/">mRNA</a> splicing machinery, are most easily explained by viewing them as descendants of a <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5014/">complex</a> network of RNA-mediated interactions that dominated cell <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5449/">metabolism</a> in the RNA world. We also discuss how <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/">DNA</a> may have taken over as the genetic material, how the <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5218/">genetic code</a> may have arisen, and how proteins may have eclipsed RNA to perform the bulk of biochemical catalysis in modern-day cells.</p><div id="A1121"><h2 id="_A1121_">Life Requires Autocatalysis</h2><p>It has been proposed that the first “biological” molecules on Earth were formed by metal-based catalysis on the crystalline surfaces of minerals. In principle, an elaborate system of molecular synthesis and breakdown (<a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5449/">metabolism</a>) could have existed on these surfaces long before the first cells arose. But life requires molecules that possess a crucial property: the ability to catalyze reactions that lead, directly or indirectly, to the production of more molecules like themselves. Catalysts with this special self-promoting property can use raw materials to reproduce themselves and thereby divert these same materials from the production of other substances. But what molecules could have had such autocatalytic properties in early cells? In present-day cells the most versatile catalysts are polypeptides, composed of many different amino acids with chemically diverse side chains and, consequently, able to adopt diverse three-dimensional forms that bristle with reactive chemical groups. But, although polypeptides are versatile as catalysts, there is no known way in which one such <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5486/">molecule</a> can reproduce itself by directly specifying the formation of another of precisely the same sequence.</p></div><div id="A1122"><h2 id="_A1122_">Polynucleotides Can Both Store Information and Catalyze Chemical Reactions</h2><p>Polynucleotides have one property that contrasts with those of polypeptides: they can directly guide the formation of exact copies of their own sequence. This capacity depends on <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5012/">complementary</a> <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4875/">base</a> pairing of <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/">nucleotide</a> subunits, which enables one polynucleotide to act as a <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5862/">template</a> for the formation of another. As we have seen in this and the preceding chapter, such complementary templating mechanisms lie at the heart of <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/">DNA</a> replication and transcription in modern-day cells.</p><p>But the efficient synthesis of polynucleotides by such <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5012/">complementary</a> templating mechanisms requires catalysts to promote the polymerization <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5717/">reaction</a>: without catalysts, <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5655/">polymer</a> formation is slow, error-prone, and inefficient. Today, <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5862/">template</a>-based <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/">nucleotide</a> polymerization is rapidly catalyzed by <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5688/">protein</a> enzymes—such as the <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5084/">DNA</a> and <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/">RNA</a> polymerases. How could it be catalyzed before proteins with the appropriate enzymatic specificity existed? The beginnings of an answer to this question were obtained in 1982, when it was discovered that RNA molecules themselves can act as catalysts. We have seen in this chapter, for example, that a <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5486/">molecule</a> of RNA is the <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4922/">catalyst</a> for the peptidyl transferase reaction that takes place on the <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5754/">ribosome</a>. The unique potential of RNA molecules to act both as information carrier and as catalyst forms the basis of the RNA world hypothesis.</p><p><a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/">RNA</a> therefore has all the properties required of a <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5486/">molecule</a> that could catalyze its own synthesis (<a href="https://danluu.com/books/NBK26876/figure/A1123/?report=objectonly" target="object" rid-figpopup="figA1123" rid-ob="figobA1123">Figure 6-92</a>). Although self-replicating systems of RNA molecules have not been found in nature, scientists are hopeful that they can be constructed in the laboratory. While this demonstration would not prove that self-replicating RNA molecules were essential in the origin of life on Earth, it would certainly suggest that such a scenario is possible.

From a purely chemical standpoint, it is difficult to imagine how long RNA molecules could be formed initially by purely nonenzymatic means. For one thing, the precursors of RNA, the ribonucleotides, are difficult to form nonenzymatically. Moreover, the formation of RNA requires that a long series of 3′ to 5′ phosphodiester linkages form in the face of a set of competing reactions, including hydrolysis, 2′ to 5′ linkages, 5′ to 5′ linkages, and so on. Given these problems, it has been suggested that the first molecules to possess both catalytic activity and information storage capabilities may have been polymers that resemble RNA but are chemically simpler (<a href="https://danluu.com/books/NBK26876/figure/A1125/?report=objectonly" target="object" rid-figpopup="figA1125" rid-ob="figobA1125">Figure 6-93</a>). We do not have any remnants of these compounds in present-day cells, nor do such compounds leave fossil records. Nonetheless, the relative simplicity of these “RNA-like polymers” make them better candidates than RNA itself for the first biopolymers on Earth that had both information storage capacity and catalytic activity.

The plausibility of this scheme is supported by laboratory experiments showing that one of these simpler forms (PNA—see <a href="https://danluu.com/books/NBK26876/figure/A1125/?report=objectonly" target="object" rid-figpopup="figA1125" rid-ob="figobA1125">Figure 6-93</a>) can act as a template for the synthesis of <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5012/">complementary</a> RNA molecules, because the overall geometry of the bases is similar in the two molecules.

If some of these neighboring RNAs have catalytic actions that help the survival of RNA in other ways (catalyzing ribonucleotide production, for example), a set of different types of RNA molecules, each specialized for a different activity, may evolve into a cooperative system that replicates with unusually great efficiency.

For example, a set of mutually beneficial RNAs (such as those of <a href="https://danluu.com/books/NBK26876/figure/A1134/?report=objectonly" target="object" rid-figpopup="figA1134" rid-ob="figobA1134">Figure 6-99</a>) could replicate themselves only if all the RNAs were to remain in the neighborhood of the <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/">RNA</a> that is specialized for templated polymerization. Moreover, if these RNAs were free to diffuse among a large population of other RNA molecules, they could be co-opted by other replicating systems, which would then compete with the original RNA system for raw materials. Selection of a set of RNA molecules according to the quality of the self-replicating systems they generated could not occur efficiently until some form of <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5009/">compartment</a> evolved to contain them and thereby make them available only to the RNA that had generated them. An early, crude form of compartmentalization may have been simple adsorption on surfaces or particles.</p><p>The need for more sophisticated types of containment is easily fulfilled by a class of small molecules that has the simple physicochemical property of being <i><a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4813/">amphipathic</a></i>, that is, consisting of one part that is hydrophobic (water insoluble) and another part that is <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5305/">hydrophilic</a> (water soluble). When such molecules are placed in water they aggregate, arranging their hydrophobic portions as much in contact with one another as possible and their hydrophilic portions in contact with the water. Amphipathic molecules of appropriate shape spontaneously aggregate to form <i>bilayers</i>, creating small closed vesicles whose <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4840/">aqueous</a> contents are isolated from the external medium (<a href="https://danluu.com/books/NBK26876/figure/A1135/?report=objectonly" target="object" rid-figpopup="figA1135" rid-ob="figobA1135">Figure 6-100</a>). The phenomenon can be demonstrated in a test tube by simply mixing phospholipids and water together: under appropriate conditions, small vesicles will form. All present-day cells are surrounded by a <i><a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5642/">plasma membrane</a></i>consisting of amphipathic molecules—mainly phospholipids—in this configuration; we discuss these molecules in detail in Chapter 10.

Although we understand most of them, they do not make conceptual sense in the way that <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5098/">DNA transcription</a>, <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5094/">DNA repair</a>, and DNA replication do. It is especially difficult to imagine how protein synthesis evolved because it is now performed by a complex interlocking system of protein and <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/">RNA</a> molecules; obviously the proteins could not have existed until an early version of the translation apparatus was already in place. Although we can only speculate on the origins of protein synthesis and the <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5218/">genetic code</a>, several experimental approaches have provided possible scenarios.</p><p>
<i>In vitro</i> <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/">RNA</a> selection experiments of the type summarized previously in <a href="https://danluu.com/books/NBK26876/figure/A1130/?report=objectonly" target="object" rid-figpopup="figA1130" rid-ob="figobA1130">Figure 6-97</a> have produced RNA molecules that can bind tightly to amino acids. The <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5567/">nucleotide</a> sequences of these RNAs often contain a disproportionately high frequency of codons for the <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A4807/">amino acid</a> that is recognized. For example, RNA molecules that bind selectively to arginine have a preponderance of Arg codons and those that bind tyrosine have a preponderance of Tyr codons. This correlation is not perfect for all the amino acids, and its interpretation is controversial, but it raises the possibility that a limited <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5218/">genetic code</a> could have arisen from the direct association of amino acids with specific sequences of RNA, with RNAs serving as a crude <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5862/">template</a> to direct the non-random polymerization of a few different amino acids. In the RNA world described previously, any RNA that helped guide the synthesis of a useful <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5658/">polypeptide</a> would have a great advantage in the evolutionary struggle for survival.</p><p>In present-day cells, <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5902/">tRNA</a> adaptors are used to match amino acids to codons, and proteins catalyze tRNA aminoacylation. However, ribozymes created in the laboratory can perform specific tRNA aminoacylation reactions, so it is plausible that tRNA-like adaptors could have arisen in an <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/">RNA</a> world. This <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5071/">development</a> would have made the matching of “<a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5496/">mRNA</a>” sequences to amino acids more efficient, and it perhaps allowed an increase in the number of amino acids that could be used in templated <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5688/">protein</a> synthesis.</p><p>Finally, the efficiency of early forms of <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5688/">protein</a> synthesis would be increased dramatically by the catalysis of <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5605/">peptide bond</a> formation. This evolutionary <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5071/">development</a> presents no conceptual problem since, as we have seen, this <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5717/">reaction</a> is catalyzed by <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5767/">rRNA</a> in present-day cells. One can envision a crude peptidyl transferase <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5755/">ribozyme</a>, which, over time, grew larger and acquired the ability to position charged tRNAs accurately on <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/">RNA</a> templates—leading eventually to the modern <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5754/">ribosome</a>. Once protein synthesis evolved, the transition to a protein-dominated world could proceed, with proteins eventually taking over the majority of catalytic and structural tasks because of their greater versatility, with 20 rather than 4 different subunits.</p></div><div id="A1137"><h2 id="_A1137_">All Present-day Cells Use DNA as Their Hereditary Material</h2><p>The cells of the <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5756/">RNA</a> world would presumably have been much less <a href="https://danluu.com/books/n/mboc4/A4754/def-item/A5014/">complex</a> and less efficient in reproducing themselves than even the simplest present-day cells, since catalysis by RNA molecules is less efficient than that by proteins.
