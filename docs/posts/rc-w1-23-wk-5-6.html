    <h1>RC W1&#39;23 | Wk 5/6</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Reflecting on the fifth week of my second batch at RC.</em></p><span id="continue-reading"></span><hr/><p>This week was difficult for me. You may have noticed that my post title format changed a bit to reflect a tough call I had to make this week. My current circumstances aren&#39;t allowing me to participate as fully at RC as I would like, so after thinking about it and discussing it with faculty, I decided to cut my batch short from a full-batch (12 weeks) to a half-batch (6 weeks). I decided it wasn&#39;t fair to myself or my peers to have my attention so fractured between RC and life. I don&#39;t want to dwell too long on this or go into much detail, but I figured it was worth noting. Officially the end of my batch is on the 8th, but my last week won&#39;t see very much activity as I&#39;ll be moving during that time. I&#39;ll still try to get some &#34;recurse-y&#34; things in where I can. Anyway, I&#39;ll write more about what things will look like for the rest of this year and onward, but for now let&#39;s summarize the past week.</p><p>I was feeling unwell today and saved what energy I had on accomplishing moving tasks. I did end up working a bit on my Bevy card-interface in the evening though! I spent time learning how to package parts of the project as a plugin. I wasn&#39;t sure if packaging the hover and drag functionality into a single plugin made sense or if it would make more sense to have them be complimentary plugins. I also was trying to figure out how I could describe some kind of &#34;on-hover&#34; behavior in either case, ECS design is still a bit foreign to me. I also spent more time working on the dragon sculpt, blocking out the body and legs. Nothing really to show-off here except some low-poly shapes that vaguely look like limbs.</p><p>I signed up to present something on my Bevy card game interface on Thursday. I didn&#39;t track what I did today and I&#39;ve forgotten, whoops.</p><p>Today was the day I decided that staying in-batch was no longer sustainable. I scheduled a chat with faculty to discuss my options on Thursday and backed out of the presentation I signed-up to give.</p><p>I applied to work for a local company as a website administrator on a contract basis. Something simple but potentially could lead to other opportunities or at least just some semi-steady income for some months.</p><p>I had to spend a lot of time taking care of our dog overnight. He had been having digestive issues on and off for about two weeks, and things had gotten worse this week. So I was occupied with taking care of him today.</p><p>I had my call with faculty to explain my situation and discuss options, as a result I officially indicated I would only be participating for 6 weeks. I spent some time thinking about how I wanted to structure my next week and the weeks following the end of my batch, and then I attended weekly presentations.</p><p>I spent a bit of time trying to decide how I wanted to participate in <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> this year before ultimately deciding I would do it in Rust again. Then, when the puzzle dropped, I <a href="https://github.com/ChrisRenfrow/aoc-2023-rs/blob/cfbff878dd45e8acdb4030aae69572f6b4e34a14/d01/src/lib.rs">solved part one</a> alongside many other recursers and left the rest for the following day.</p><p>I <a href="https://github.com/ChrisRenfrow/aoc-2023-rs/blob/8066ce6fb2c6c69a9482b67bdbe94af2ac691c85/d01/src/lib.rs">solved AoC day one part two</a> early in the afternoon. And finally, the keyboard I ordered 6 weeks ago arrived! I decided that since we were on the verge of moving though I should probably not start working on getting it assembled until after we finish.</p><p>Later I hopped on a voice chat with my friend, originally to play videogames, but since nobody else showed up I talked him into solving AoC day two with me! I decided to use the popular Rust parser combinator crate, <code>nom</code> for this one, I didn&#39;t solve it before going to bed but I did achieve <a href="https://github.com/ChrisRenfrow/aoc-2023-rs/blob/e9cd5872e1819910e89a1354509944eef9c4ab22/d02/src/lib.rs">functional parsing</a>!</p><p>Not an ideal week by any stretch of the imagination, probably even worse than <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/rc-w123-week-three">week three</a> in some ways. But the highlight of my week hands-down was participating in Advent of Code. I can&#39;t understate how very fun and rewarding it is to do Advent of Code alongside a group of other programmers, especially when all of them love sharing their unique solutions and discussing strategies. Very fun.</p></section></div>
