<p>A sheet of paper or a piece of fabric can lie perfectly flat on a table, but it can also be rolled
up into a cylinder or a cone, and twisted in certain ways, without being stretched or sheared.
Figures drawn on the material when it lies flat retain their shape, in the sense that distances measured <i>within the material itself</i>
are unchanged by the way it happens to sit in three-dimensional space.</p>
<p>The geometry of ordinary paper is flat, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">Euclidean geometry</a>, but what about the equivalent for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">spherical geometry</a> (which would be something like a piece of orange peel),
or for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">hyperbolic geometry</a>?</p>
<p>The aim of this page is to investigate the possibilities for all three cases:  given
a piece of an idealised two-dimensional material whose geometry is Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic, what shapes can it adopt in three-dimensional Euclidean space?</p>

<a id="Assumptions"></a>
<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Our idealised material is assumed to be infinitesimally thin, and perfectly flexible.
For example, a flat sheet could be rolled into a cylinder whose radius is as small as we like, so
long as it’s not zero.  But we will <b>not</b> allow the material to contain sharp folds, where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_(geometry)" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">normal</a> to the surface undergoes a discontinuous jump from one side of the fold to the other.</li>
<li>The material is assumed to be perfectly <b>inextensible</b>.
So however much we bend it, it doesn’t stretch or shear:  all distances along curves drawn
on the material, and all angles between such curves where they cross, remain unchanged.</li>
<li>We will sometimes talk about solutions where the material <b>might</b> intersect itself in three-dimensional
space, because the most mathematically simple statements about general solutions won’t rule
that out.</li>
<li>We will assume that all the mathematical functions describing the way the material is embedded in
three-dimensional space are “sufficiently smooth”: whenever we need to take a derivative of something,
that derivative exists and is continuous, except possibly at the boundary of the material.</li>
</ul>
<a id="GC"></a>
<h2>Gaussian Curvature</h2>
<p>There are three kinds of two-dimensional space that have constant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_curvature" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">Gaussian curvature</a>, <i>K</i>:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">Euclidean plane</a>, with <span><i>K</i> = 0</span></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_geometry" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">spheres</a>, with <span><i>K</i> &gt; 0</span></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_geometry" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">hyperbolic planes</a>, with <span><i>K</i> &lt; 0.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>[There are also spaces that consist of pieces of these spaces, with boundaries, or pieces where all or some of
the boundaries have been joined together.]</p>
<p>Gaussian curvature, <i>K</i>, is a number that quantifies the manner and extent in which the geometry of a two-dimensional
space departs from Euclidean geometry.  It can be defined in many different ways, but one approach is to look at the geometry of a circle: the set of points that lie at a fixed distance from a given point, where we need to measure
this along the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">geodesic curves</a>
that minimise the distance between points.</p>
<p>On the surface of a sphere with radius <i>a</i>, we measure distances along
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">great circles</a>,
and a circle of radius <i>r</i> centred on the pole in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">spherical coordinates</a> will lie at an angle of
<span>θ = <i>r</i>/<i>a</i></span> radians from the pole.  A straightforward calculation gives the
circumference and area of such a circle:</p>
<blockquote>
Circumference(<i>r</i>) = 2 π <i>a</i> sin(<i>r</i>/<i>a</i>)</blockquote>
<p>In general, a two-dimensional space might have different curvature at different
points, but we can still characterise the local geometry by examining the limiting behaviour as the radius <i>r</i> of the
circle becomes very small.  If we take the first two non-zero terms of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">Taylor series</a>
for the formulas above, we get:</p>
<blockquote>
Circumference(<i>r</i>) ≈ 2 π <i>r</i> – (π/(3 <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>)) <i>r</i><sup>3</sup></blockquote>
<p>We can quantify the extent to which these formulas deviate from the usual Euclidean formulas for circumference and area, <span>2 π <i>r</i></span> and <span>π <i>r</i><sup>2</sup>,</span> by defining the Gaussian curvature <i>K</i> to be
either:
</p>
<blockquote>
<i>K</i> = (3/π) lim<sub><i>r</i> → 0</sub> (2 π <i>r</i> – Circumference(<i>r</i>)) / <i>r</i><sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>or:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>K</i> = (12/π) lim<sub><i>r</i> → 0</sub> (π <i>r</i> <sup>2</sup> – Area(<i>r</i>)) / <i>r</i><sup>4</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>For the case of a sphere of radius <i>a</i>, both definitions yield:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>K</i> = 1 / <i>a</i><sup>2</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way of characterising Gaussian curvature is via the notion of <b>angular excess</b>.
For any triangle in the plane whose sides are straight line segments, the sum of the
three interior angles at the vertices is exactly π.  On a sphere of radius <i>a</i>, the sum of the
three angles for 
a triangle whose sides are geodesics
depends on the area of the triangle, <i>A</i>.  Specifically:</p>
<blockquote>
Sum-of-angles(<i>A</i>) = π + <i>A</i>/<i>a</i><sup>2</sup> = π + <i>K</i> <i>A</i> 
</blockquote>
<p>We won’t prove this, but it is easy to check for some simple cases.
For example, a triangle with one vertex at the north pole, and two that are 90 degrees apart on the equator,
will have an area one-eighth that of the whole sphere, or 4π<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>/8 = π<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>/2,
and since all three angles are right-angles, the sum of its angles will be 3π/2, in agreement
with the formula.  The local value of the curvature <i>K</i> can be obtained in the limiting case of
a small triangle:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>K</i> = lim<sub><i>A</i>→0</sub> (Sum-of-angles(<i>A</i>) – π) / <i>A</i>
</blockquote>
<p>We have used a sphere to demonstrate how geometry is affected by positive Gaussian curvature, but
exactly the same mathematical relationships hold in surfaces with <b>negative</b> curvature.
So when <i>K</i> &lt; 0, the circumference and area of a circle are <b>larger</b> than those of a circle of the same
radius in the plane, and the sum of the three angles of a triangle whose sides are geodesics will be
<b>less than</b> π.</p>
<p>The description we are given of a two-dimensional space will usually come in either of two forms.  We might be
told how the space has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedding" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">embedded</a>
as a surface in three-dimensional Euclidean space, like the sphere we have just described.
Or we might be given a description of the surface’s <b>intrinsic geometry</b>, in terms of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">metric</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="#Appendix">appendix</a> to this web page explains how the Gaussian curvature is calculated in both these cases.
For a more comprehensive treatment, there are many good textbooks,
such as Lipschutz,<sup><a href="#REF1">[1]</a></sup> that give a detailed account of “the classical theory of surfaces,” which deals with the geometry of two-dimensional spaces via surfaces embedded in three-dimensional
space.</p>
<a id="Flat"></a>
<h2>Intrinsically Flat Surfaces</h2>
<p>There are four kinds of surfaces embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space that are <b>intrinsically flat</b>, with a constant Gaussian curvature of zero:</p>
<ul>
<li>planes</li>
<li>cylinders</li>
<li>cones</li>
<li>tangent surfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these categories can be seen as either special cases or limiting cases of others; for example, cylinders are like cones whose apex is moved infinitely far away.</p>
<a id="Planes"></a>
<h3>Planes</h3>
<p>That planes are flat is not just obvious, it’s the case where, if our measure of intrinsic curvature gave any
other result than zero, we would throw it away and look for a new one.  To check that
we don’t need to do that, note that we can parameterise any plane with the formula:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) = <b>P</b> + <i>u</i> <b>a</b> + <i>v</i> <b>b</b>
</blockquote>
<p>where <b>P</b> is a point on the plane and <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are two fixed, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">linearly independent</a> vectors that are parallel to the plane.  All three second derivatives of <b>x</b>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) with respect to the
parameters are zero, so the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_fundamental_form" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">second fundamental form</a>, <b>S</b>, of the surface, defined in the <a href="#Appendix">appendix</a>,
will be zero everywhere, making its determinant zero, while the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_fundamental_form" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">first fundamental form</a>, <b>g</b>, will have a non-zero determinant because <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are linearly independent.
So the Gaussian curvature, <span><i>K</i> = det(<b>S</b>) / det(<b>g</b>),</span> will be zero.</p>
<a id="Cylinders"></a>
<h3>Cylinders</h3>
<figure><img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/cyl1.png" width="300" height="500" alt="Cylinder from closed curve"/><figcaption>Cylinder from closed curve</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/cyl2.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Cylinder from self-intersecting curve"/><figcaption>Cylinder from self-intersecting curve</figcaption></figure>
<p>Given a curve <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) that lies in a plane, the <b>cylinder</b>
generated by <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) is the surface traced out by all the lines perpendicular to the plane that pass through points on <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>).
If the curve is closed, the cylinder will be finite in one direction, and if the curve is self-intersecting,
the cylinder will be a self-intersecting surface, but if the curve is infinitely long and never intersects itself,
the cylinder will be infinite in all directions, and will be an embedding of the entire Euclidean plane.</p>
<p>Suppose the parameter <i>s</i> for the curve is its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_length" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">arc length</a>, and let <b>p</b> be a unit-length normal
to the plane of the curve (we will reserve <b>n</b> for the normal vector to the cylinder itself).  Then we can parameterise the cylinder as:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) = <b>c</b>(<i>u</i>) + <i>v</i> <b>p</b>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the methods described in the <a href="#Appendix">appendix</a>, we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b><sub><i>u</i></sub> = <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>)</blockquote>
<p>There is an easy way to construct an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometry" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">isometry</a> (a one-to-one
distance-preserving function) between these cylinders and all or part of the Euclidean plane: we map the point with
coordinates <span>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>)</span> on the cylinder to the point <span>(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>)</span> in the usual
Cartesian coordinates on the plane, setting:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>x</i> = <i>u</i></blockquote>
<p>The metric in <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> coordinates is exactly the same as the Euclidean metric, so this
map preserves distances and angles measured within the embedded surface.</p>
<p>If the curve <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) never intersects itself, in the case of an infinitely long curve we get an isometry between the entire Euclidean plane and the cylinder.  For finite curves, or if we choose to limit the range of the
<i>v</i> coordinate, the isometry is with a piece of the plane.</p>
<p>If the cylinder is generated by a closed curve, the topology is no longer that of a piece of the plane, but
that of a piece with two opposite edges joined together.  Locally, the distinction is not important, and the
Gaussian curvature remains zero everywhere, but obviously a circular cylinder is not <b>globally</b> isometric to
a rectangle, or a strip of finite width, because some points on the opposite edges end up closer to each other
in the cylinder.</p>
<a id="Cones"></a>
<h3>Cones</h3>
<figure><img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/cone1.png" width="300" height="400" alt="Right circular cone, wedge angle less than 2pi"/><figcaption>Right circular cone, wedge angle &lt; 2π</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/cone2.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Cone with wedge angle equal to 2pi"/><figcaption>Cone with wedge angle = 2π</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/cone3.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Cone with wedge angle greater than 2pi"/><figcaption>Cone with wedge angle &gt; 2π</figcaption></figure>
<p>We will define a <b>cone</b> as the surface traced out by all the lines that pass through a
curve <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) and some fixed point <b>A</b>, the apex of the cone, which does not lie on the curve.
Unlike the cylinder, we will not require <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) to be planar, but we will impose the condition
that <b>the tangent to the curve never points directly towards the apex</b>.  We can parameterise this surface as:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) = <b>A</b> + <i>v</i> (<b>c</b>(<i>u</i>) – <b>A</b>)<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>The original curve is given by <i>v</i> = 1, and the apex by <i>v</i> = 0.
We then have, for <i>v</i> ≠ 0, and assuming <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) is parameterised by arc length:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b><sub><i>u</i></sub> = <i>v</i> <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>)</blockquote>
<p>In general, the apex, <i>v</i> = 0, will not contain a neighbourhood that looks like part of a plane, so it needs to be
excluded, and the surfaces with <i>v</i> &lt; 0 and <i>v</i> &gt; 0 are not connected to each other.  Depending on the exact shape of the curve and the relative location of the apex, cones might or might
not be self-intersecting elsewhere.</p>
<p>The most familiar example of a cone is a <b>right circular cone</b>, generated by a circle and an apex that lies directly above the centre of the circle.  The portion of the plane that is embedded as a
right circular cone is always a wedge with an angle less than 2π.  However, cones generated by
sufficiently meandering curves can come from wedges of any angle, including angles greater than or equal to 2π.</p>
<p>If the wedge angle is <b>exactly</b> 2π, as in the second illustration at the start of this section,
then the cone might or might not count as an embedding of the entire Euclidean plane, depending on how strict
we want to be about the smoothness of the embedding at the apex.  If the wedge angle is <b>greater than</b> 2π,
as in the third illustration, then the
cone cannot be an embedding of just one copy of the Euclidean plane
(in the illustration,
an extra piece that comes from a second copy of the plane is coloured green).  But it will still be
a perfectly good intrinsically flat space, so long as we exclude the apex.</p>
<p>To construct an isometry between a cone described in the <span>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>)</span>
coordinates we used in the definition, and part of the plane (or maybe parts of more than one plane),
it is easiest if we work in polar coordinates <span>(<i>r</i>, θ).</span>  An isometry is then given by:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>r</i> = <i>v</i> |<b>c</b>(<i>u</i>) – <b>A</b>|</blockquote>
<p>The integral for θ amounts to adding up the distance we travel along the curve perpendicular to a line towards the apex, divided by the distance to the apex, to give us the angle we have travelled “around” the apex to reach the coordinate value <i>u</i>.</p>
<p>For example, if <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>)
is a circle of radius <i>R</i> and the apex lies at a distance <i>H</i> directly above the centre of the circle,
we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) = (<i>R</i> cos(<i>s</i>/<i>R</i>), <i>R</i> sin(<i>s</i>/<i>R</i>), 0)</blockquote>
<p>The <i>u</i> coordinate will range from 0 to 2π<i>R</i>, so θ will range from 0 to
<span>2π<i>R</i>/√(<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>H</i><sup>2</sup>).</span>
This confirms that any right circular cone has a wedge angle of less than 2π.
But for other cones, if θ exceeds 2π we will need to obtain the remainder of the surface from
one or more extra copies of the plane.</p>
<a id="TangentSurfaces"></a>
<h3>Tangent surfaces</h3>
<figure><img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/ts0.png" width="350" height="500" alt="Tangent surfaces to a helix, v greater than zero in yellow, v less than zero in red"/><figcaption>Tangent surfaces to a helix,</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/ts1.png" width="350" height="500" alt="Tangent surface to a helix, colours correspond to diffferent copies of the plane"/><figcaption>Tangent surface to a helix, colours correspond</figcaption></figure>
<p>Suppose we have a curve <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>), parameterised by arc length <i>s</i>, that
has
<b>no points of inflection</b>:
that is, no points where the unit-length tangent to the curve, <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>s</i>), has a rate of change  of zero as we move along the curve.  This is the same as saying that for all <i>s</i>, <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>s</i>) ≠ 0.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangent_developable" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">tangent surface</a> of <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) is the surface consisting of all lines that are tangents to the curve.
[In some literature, this is called the <b>tangent developable</b>; the term
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developable_surface" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">“developable”</a>
refers to any intrinsically flat surface.]  We can parameterise the tangent surface as:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) = <b>c</b>(<i>u</i>) + <i>v</i> <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>)<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>Because <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) is parameterised by arc length, <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>s</i>) has a constant length
of 1, and its rate of change, <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>s</i>), is always orthogonal to it, since it can only change direction,
not length.  We then have, for <i>v</i> ≠ 0:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b><sub><i>u</i></sub> = <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) + <i>v</i> <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>)</blockquote>
<p>It might not be immediately obvious from our definitions, but we do <b>not</b> obtain a single,
smooth surface if we allow the <i>v</i> coordinate to take on both positive and negative values.
The first figure at the start of this section makes this clear; the yellow and red surfaces meet along the
generating curve, but there is a cusp where they come together, rather than a smooth transition.</p>
<p>To find an isometry between a tangent surface and part of the plane, we will focus on the
particular example of the tangent surface to a helix, <b>h</b>(<i>s</i>), with radius <i>a</i>
and pitch controlled by <i>b</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
We define a parameter <i>c</i> = √(<i>a</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>b</i><sup>2</sup>)</blockquote>
<p>To construct an isometry, we will first identify a convenient set of

on the tangent surface, which will need to correspond to straight lines in the plane.
To start, we will note that <b>any</b> straight line (in the sense of being straight in 
three-dimensional Euclidean space) in <b>any</b> smoothly embedded surface is a geodesic.<sup><a href="#REF4">[4]</a></sup> So the lines of fixed <i>u</i> and varying <i>v</i> in a tangent
surface are all geodesics.</p>
<p>To find other geodesics, we will make use of the fact that the metric for the
helix tangent surface is completely independent of the <i>u</i> coordinate.  It follows
that changing <i>u</i> by a fixed amount everywhere maps the surface into itself isometrically;
that is, it is a symmetry of the surface, which corresponds to a screwlike motion, where we rotate
the surface around the axis of the helix while also moving everything along the axis.</p>
<p>A further consequence of this is that, along any geodesic <b>G</b>(<i>s</i>), the dot product between
the tangent to the geodesic, <b>G</b>&#39;(<i>s</i>), and the vector field that corresponds to a uniform
change in the <i>u</i> coordinate, which is just (1,0) in (<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) coordinates,
is constant.  This result is known as Killing’s theorem, and it is described in a bit more
detail <a href="https://www.gregegan.net/INCANDESCENCE/Symmetry/Symmetry.html">here</a> [this article is associated with my novel <i>Incandescence</i>, but there
is no need to know anything about that book to follow the discussion of the geometry].</p>
<p>So, Killing’s theorem gives us, for a geodesic:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>G</b>(<i>s</i>) = (<i>u</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>), <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>))
</blockquote>
<p>with tangent vector:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>G</b>&#39;(<i>s</i>) = (<i>u</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>), <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>))
</blockquote>
<p>a conserved quantity <i>C</i> along the geodesic:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>G</b>&#39;(<i>s</i>)<sup><i>T</i></sup> <b>g</b>(<b>G</b>(<i>s</i>)) (1,0) = <i>C</i></blockquote>
<p>We can check this for the geodesics we already know about, the lines of constant <i>u</i> and varying <i>v</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>u</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>) = <i>u</i><sub>0</sub></blockquote>
<p>If the geodesic is parameterised by arc length, its tangent will have a length of 1 everywhere,
and we can use that to solve for
<i>u</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>) in terms of <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>) and  <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>).</p>
<blockquote>
<b>G</b>&#39;(<i>s</i>)<sup><i>T</i></sup> <b>g</b>(<b>G</b>(<i>s</i>)) <b>G</b>&#39;(<i>s</i>) = 1</blockquote>
<p>With this result, we have for the conserved quantity along the geodesic:</p>
<blockquote>
(1 + <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)<sup>2</sup> / <i>c</i><sup>4</sup>) <i>u</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>) + <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>) = <i>C</i></blockquote>
<p>Suppose we want to find a geodesic that meets one of our straight-line geodesics of
constant <i>u</i> at some point (<i>u</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>), and the
two geodesics are orthogonal to each other where they meet, at <i>s</i> = 0.  Then we will
want the tangent to the geodesic at <i>s</i> = 0 to be:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>G</b>&#39;(0) = (<i>u</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(0), <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(0))
= (<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> / (<i>a</i> <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>), –<i>c</i><sup>2</sup> / (<i>a</i> <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>))
</blockquote>
<p>since this tangent has unit length, and it is orthogonal to (0,1), the tangent to the straight-line geodesic:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>G</b>&#39;(0)<sup><i>T</i></sup> <b>g</b>(<i>u</i><sub>0</sub>, <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>) <b>G</b>&#39;(0) = 1</blockquote>
<p>The initial value this gives us for <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(0) lets us compute the conserved
quantity at the start of the geodesic:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>C</i><sup>2</sup> = 1 + (<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>c</i><sup>4</sup>) <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)<sup>2</sup> (1 – <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>)<sup>2</sup>)
= (<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>c</i><sup>4</sup>) <i>v</i><sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>and the differential equation we need to solve becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
1 + (<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>c</i><sup>4</sup>) <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)<sup>2</sup> (1 – <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>)<sup>2</sup>) = (<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>c</i><sup>4</sup>) <i>v</i><sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>with the initial conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(0) = <i>v</i><sub>0</sub></blockquote>
<p>This is solved by:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>) = √[<i>s</i><sup>2</sup> – 2 (<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i>) <i>s</i> + <i>v</i><sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>]
</blockquote>
<p>If we look at the points in the (<i>s</i>, <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>) plane where <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>) = 0, it turns out they lie <b>on a circle</b>, with radius
<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i>, and centre (<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i>, 0).
This circle in the (<i>s</i>, <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>) plane corresponds to the helix in the tangent surface, and <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>) is precisely the distance from (<i>s</i>, <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>) to this circle, measured along a tangent to the circle.</p>
<p>A line of constant
<i>v</i><sub>0</sub> in the (<i>s</i>, <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>) plane
with <span>|<i>v</i><sub>0</sub>| &lt; <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i></span> will intersect the circle,
and for values of <i>s</i> that lie inside the circle, <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>) becomes imaginary.  In
other words, these geodesics of constant <i>v</i><sub>0</sub> reach the boundary of the tangent surface, the helix,
and come to an end there.  But for
<span>|<i>v</i><sub>0</sub>| &gt; <i>c</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i></span> these geodesics never hit the boundary.  Similarly, geodesics of constant <i>s</i> and varying <i>v</i><sub>0</sub> will only hit the boundary
and come to an end if
<span>0 &lt; <i>s</i> &lt; 2<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i>.</span></p>
<p>If we substitute this solution for <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>) back into our
original equation for the conserved quantity, before we eliminated <i>u</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>),
we can now solve that equation for <i>u</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>) and integrate it to find <i>u</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>).  The solution we obtain is:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>u</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>) = <i>u</i><sub>0</sub> +
2 (<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i>) arctan(<i>s</i> / (<i>v</i><sub>0</sub> + <i>v</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>)))
</blockquote>
<p>How does <i>u</i><sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>) relate to the circle in the (<i>s</i>, <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>) plane that corresponds to the helix?  For <b>points that lie on that circle</b>, it must equal <i>u</i><sub>0</sub> plus the arc length along the circle, measured from the origin.  This means that throughout the (<i>s</i>, <i>v</i><sub>0</sub>) plane, the range
of <i>u</i> values is limited to the interval <span><i>u</i><sub>0</sub> ± π (<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i>),</span> and a single copy of the plane can only
correspond to that portion of the tangent surface.</p>
<p>So the isometry we have found maps regions of the helix tangent surface where the <i>u</i> coordinate changes by <span>2π (<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i>)</span> to copies of the plane with a disk of radius <span><i>c</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i></span> cut out of it.  The second figure at the start of this
section uses different colours to show the different copies of the plane that are mapped to the surface.</p>
<p>Note that the curvature of the generating helix, as a curve
in three-dimensional Euclidean space:</p>
<blockquote>
κ = |<b>h</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>s</i>)| = <i>a</i>/<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>is precisely the curvature (the inverse of the radius, <span><i>c</i><sup>2</sup>/<i>a</i>)</span> of the corresponding circle in the plane.  This is certainly <b>not</b> true in general for the images of
curves under this isometry; for example, most straight lines in the plane do not map to straight lines in
three-dimensional space.  However, it is not a coincidence either; the generating curve
of any tangent surface always has the same curvature in three-dimensional Euclidean space as it has intrinsically
as a curve in the tangent surface, or equivalently, as the corresponding curve under an isometry with the Euclidean plane.</p>

<h3>Ruled surfaces</h3>
<figure><img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/hyp1.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Ruled 1-sheeted hyperboloid"/><figcaption>This hyperboloid is a ruled surface</figcaption></figure>
<p>All four kinds of intrinsically flat surfaces we have described are examples of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruled_surface" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">ruled surfaces</a>: surfaces that are built entirely from a family of straight lines.
But not every ruled surface is intrinsically flat.  If we compute the Gaussian curvature of an arbitrary ruled
surface, what further conditions are required to ensure that <i>K</i> = 0?</p>
<p>Suppose we have a curve, <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>),
parameterised by arc length, and at each point on the curve there is a unit-length vector <b>L</b>(<i>s</i>)
that gives the direction of the straight line passing through that point.  The resulting surface is parameterised
as:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) = <b>c</b>(<i>u</i>) + <i>v</i> <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>)
</blockquote>
<p>We perform the usual calculations to find the Gaussian curvature:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b><sub><i>u</i></sub> = <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) + <i>v</i> <b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>)</blockquote>
<p>This expression for the curvature tells us that it <b>can never be positive</b>, since it is the opposite of a squared real-valued quantity.  What’s more, it cannot be equal to a <b>constant</b> negative value, since
the only way to remove the dependence on <i>v</i> would involve either setting <span><b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) = 0,</span> or otherwise making the numerator zero, both of which would produce flat surfaces.</p>
<p>But the ruled surface will be intrinsically flat if, and only if:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) · <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) × <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) = 0
</blockquote>
<p>This 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_product" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">scalar triple
product</a> will obviously be zero if one or more of the three vectors are zero.  But it will also be zero if
any two of the vectors are parallel, or if all three vectors are coplanar.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a generalised cylinder (which includes the plane as a special case), the directions of the lines are constant, so <b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) = 0.</li>
<li>For a cone, <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) is a scalar multiple of <b>c</b>(<i>u</i>) – <b>A</b>,
where <b>A</b> is the apex, so by the product rule for derivatives, <b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) lies in the plane spanned by 
<b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) and <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>).</li>
<li>For a tangent surface, <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) = <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Are there are any other possibilities besides these four cases?  We can splice different kinds of
surface together, e.g. we could join a cone and a cylinder, but locally, is there any other way to
meet this condition on the ruled surface that we haven’t already considered?</p>
<p>The answer is no; this list is complete!  Here is a proof, taken from Lipschutz.<sup><a href="#REF5">[5]</a></sup></p>
<div>
<h4>Proof that any ruled surface with Gaussian curvature zero must be piecewise a plane/cylinder/cone/tangent surface</h4>
<p>The condition that the scalar triple product
<span><b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) · <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) × <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) = 0</span>
means there must be three functions, α(<i>u</i>), β(<i>u</i>), γ(<i>u</i>), 
which demonstrate the linear dependence of the three vectors:</p>
<blockquote>
α(<i>u</i>) <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) + β(<i>u</i>) <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) + γ(<i>u</i>) <b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) = 0</blockquote>
<p>This must be true for the entire range of the <i>u</i> parameter relevant to the surface in question, but it’s possible that different subsets of {α(<i>u</i>), β(<i>u</i>), γ(<i>u</i>)}
will be zero on various intervals of the parameter.</p>
<p><b>Case 1</b>.  Suppose α(<i>u</i>) = 0 on some interval for <i>u</i>.  Then on that interval, the original condition becomes:</p>
<blockquote>
β(<i>u</i>) <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) + γ(<i>u</i>) <b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) = 0</blockquote>
<p>Because <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) is a unit vector, its derivative is always orthogonal to it, and we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) · (β(<i>u</i>) <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) + γ(<i>u</i>) <b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>)) = 
β(<i>u</i>) = 0</blockquote>
<p>This means <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) is a constant vector, and the portion of the surface corresponding to this
interval must be a generalised cylinder (which includes the plane as a special case).</p>
<p><b>Case 2.</b>  Suppose α(<i>u</i>) ≠ 0 on some interval for <i>u</i>.  Then we can solve the
original equation for <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>):</p>
<blockquote>
<b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) = –β(<i>u</i>)/α(<i>u</i>) <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) – γ(<i>u</i>)/α(<i>u</i>) <b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>)
</blockquote>
<p>We will define a new curve, <b>C</b>(<i>u</i>), as:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>C</b>(<i>u</i>) = <b>c</b>(<i>u</i>) + γ(<i>u</i>)/α(<i>u</i>) <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>)
</blockquote>
<p>Differentiating with respect to <i>u</i>, we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>C</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) = <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) + d(γ(<i>u</i>)/α(<i>u</i>))/d<i>u</i> <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>)
+ γ(<i>u</i>)/α(<i>u</i>) <b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>)</blockquote>
<p>where we have defined η(<i>u</i>) as:</p>
<blockquote>
η(<i>u</i>) = d(γ(<i>u</i>)/α(<i>u</i>))/d<i>u</i> – β(<i>u</i>)/α(<i>u</i>)
</blockquote>
<p><b>Case 2A.</b>  Suppose η(<i>u</i>) = 0 on some sub-interval of the one we are considering where
α(<i>u</i>) ≠ 0.  Then on that sub-interval we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>C</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) = 0</blockquote>
<p>This means that all the lines that generate the surface pass through <b>A</b>, and the surface must either be a generalised cone with apex <b>A</b>, or part of a plane.</p>
<p><b>Case 2B.</b>  Suppose η(<i>u</i>) ≠ 0 on some sub-interval.  Then we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) = <b>C</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) / η(<i>u</i>)</blockquote>
<p>This means the lines that generate the surface are all tangents to the curve <b>C</b>(<i>u</i>),
and the surface here is part of the tangent surface to <b>C</b>(<i>u</i>).</p>
</div>
<p>The one remaining question is whether there is any way to have an intrinsically flat surface that is
not a ruled surface.  The answer to that is no;<sup><a href="#REF6">[6]</a></sup> we won’t
reproduce the proof here, but it formalises the intuitive idea that if, at every point, one of the <a href="#Appendix">principal curvatures</a>
of the surface is zero, then if you keep moving across the surface in the corresponding direction, you must
be following a straight line in three-dimensional space.</p>
<a id="RectifyingDevelopables"></a>
<h3>Rectifying developables</h3>
<p>Given a smooth, non-self-intersecting curve <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) in three-dimensional Euclidean space, is it possible to find an intrinsically flat surface in which that curve is a geodesic?  Intuition suggests that the answer should be yes:  a strip of (perfectly flexible) paper, narrow enough that it won’t bump into itself in any tight places on the curve, could be positioned so that its centreline coincides with the curve.</p>
<p>The surface that meets this condition is known as the <b>rectifying developable</b> for the curve.<sup><a href="#REF7">[7]</a></sup>  We know from the previous section that it will be a ruled surface, so we can
parameterise it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) = <b>c</b>(<i>u</i>) + <i>v</i> <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>)
</blockquote>
<p>for some <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) yet to be determined, which we will write initially as:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) = <i>A</i>(<i>u</i>) <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) + <i>B</i>(<i>u</i>) <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>)
+ <i>D</i>(<i>u</i>) <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) × <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>)
</blockquote>
<p>A normal vector to the surface at any point on the curve <b>c</b>(<i>u</i>) will be given by:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>N</b>(<i>u</i>) = <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) × <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>)</blockquote>
<p>Along a geodesic, the
tangent to the curve, <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>), its derivative, <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>), and the normal vector to the surface, <b>N</b>(<i>u</i>), all lie in the same plane.<sup><a href="#REF3">[3]</a></sup>  So to make <b>c</b>(<i>u</i>) a geodesic, we must have:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>N</b>(<i>u</i>) · (<b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) × <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>)) = 0<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>which requires (assuming <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>) is nonzero) that <span><i>B</i>(<i>u</i>) = 0.</span> Then the condition for this ruled surface to be intrinsically flat is:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>L</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) · <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) × <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) = 0</blockquote>
<p>Here κ(<i>u</i>) is the length of <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>), which measures the curvature of <b>c</b>(<i>u</i>),
and τ(<i>u</i>) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torsion_of_a_curve" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">torsion</a> of the curve, which measures the rate at which the plane of the curve is changing
its orientation as we move along the curve.  It is given by:</p>
<blockquote>
τ(<i>s</i>) = (<b>c</b>&#39;(<i>s</i>) × <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>s</i>)) · <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;&#39;(<i>s</i>) / κ(<i>s</i>)<sup>2</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>If we want <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) to be a unit-length vector, this condition will be satisfied by:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) = (τ(<i>u</i>) <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) + <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>) × <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>))
/ √[τ(<i>u</i>)<sup>2</sup> + κ(<i>u</i>)<sup>2</sup>] 
</blockquote>
<p>The numerator here is a vector associated with the curve, known as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darboux_vector" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">Darboux vector</a>,
which describes the “angular velocity” of the orthogonal set of axes given by the unit-length tangent to
the curve, <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>u</i>), its derivative, <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>), and their cross product, as we move along the curve.  (It is common practice to also normalise the last two vectors to unit length, giving an orthonormal
frame known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenet%E2%80%93Serret_formulas" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">Frenet-Serret frame</a>.)</p>
<p>So, if we take a smooth, non-self-intersecting curve and construct a ruled surface whose lines lie in the direction of the Darboux vector at each point on the curve, the curve will be a geodesic
for that surface.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/Darboux.gif" width="506" height="350" alt="The Frenet-Serret frame for a curve and the axis it rotates around"/><figcaption>The Frenet-Serret frame for the blue curve</figcaption></figure>
<figure><img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/Rectifying.gif" width="506" height="350" alt="The rectifying developable for a sequence of curves"/><figcaption>These surfaces are the rectifying developables for the blue curves,</figcaption></figure>
<p>If <b>c</b>(<i>u</i>) is a straight line, the Darboux vector will be undefined, but we can use any plane that contains that line as a surface with the required properties.</p>
<p>The next simplest case would be a planar curve.
This will have zero torsion, so <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) will be a fixed vector perpendicular to the plane of the curve,
giving us a cylinder. Similarly, if we choose a curve that is a geodesic on a cone,
the rectifying developable will be that cone.</p>
<p>But generically, the surface we get from a curve will be a tangent surface, and we can explicitly identify
the curve whose tangents are the same set of straight lines as we get from the Darboux vectors of the
original curve.  If we define:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>T</b>(<i>s</i>) = <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) + [κ(<i>s</i>)/(τ(<i>s</i>) κ&#39;(<i>s</i>) – τ&#39;(<i>s</i>) κ(<i>s</i>))] (τ(<i>s</i>) <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>s</i>) + <b>c</b>&#39;(<i>s</i>) × <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>s</i>))
</blockquote>
<p>then it turns out that <b>T</b>&#39;(<i>s</i>) is parallel to the Darboux vector for <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>),
so the tangent surface for <b>T</b>(<i>s</i>) is the rectifying developable for <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>).
Note that the parameter <i>s</i> here is an arc length parameter for <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) only, and not for
<b>T</b>(<i>s</i>).</p>
<p><b>T</b>(<i>s</i>) will constitute an <b>edge</b> to the surface, just
as any curve does for its own tangent surface.  The distance <b>measured along the ruling line</b> from the point <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) to the edge of the surface will be:</p>
<blockquote>
Distance to edge along ruling</blockquote>
<p>If we want to know the <b>orthogonal</b> distance, measured within the surface, between a point on the edge, <b>T</b>(<i>s</i>), and the generating curve (which is a geodesic for the surface), we can make use of the fact that the sine of the angle between the ruling lines and
the curve is <span>κ(<i>s</i>)/√[τ(<i>s</i>)<sup>2</sup> + κ(<i>s</i>)<sup>2</sup>],</span> from which we obtain:</p>
<blockquote>
Orthogonal distance from edge to prescribed geodesic</blockquote>
<p>We can also use that formula for the the sine of the angle between the ruling lines and
the curve to write an isometry between the rectifying developable and the plane, in Cartesian coordinates (<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>):</p>
<blockquote>
<i>x</i> = <i>u</i></blockquote>
<p>If the curvature vector <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>) is zero at an isolated point
<i>u</i><sub>0</sub>, the unit-length normal vector <b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>)/|<b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>)|, which is undefined at
<i>u</i><sub>0</sub>, can either have the same, or opposite, limiting values on either side of <i>u</i><sub>0</sub>.
If the torsion also goes to zero at the same point, the normalised Darboux vector we are using for <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) can also switch direction.
This doesn’t affect the surface itself (since the ruling lines, which follow the Darboux vector in both directions, are unchanged) but in order to make the (<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) coordinates
continuous across the change, we can multiply <b>L</b>(<i>u</i>) by a sign that is chosen in order to extend continuity as much as possible.</p>
<p>If the torsion does <b>not</b> go to zero at a point where the curvature does, then that marks a point
where <b>c</b>(<i>s</i>) intersects the edge curve <b>T</b>(<i>s</i>).</p>
<p>If we construct the rectifying developable for a smooth closed curve on which the curvature is <b>never zero</b>,
then the surface will be topologically a cylinder:  a piece of the plane whose opposite edges join up without a twist.  But if there are an odd number of points of zero curvature and torsion where the direction of
the normalised curvature and Darboux vectors change discontinuously, the surface will be a <b>Möbius strip</b>.</p>
<a id="MoebiusStrips"></a>
<h3>Möbius strips</h3>

<p>We can embed a Möbius strip isometrically in three dimensions by wrapping the strip around three cylinders, as in the first image above.  In this case, 
the centreline is a piecewise function that splices together three helices and three line segments, and the surface is spliced together from three cylindrical regions and three planar regions.</p>
<p>We can also embed a Möbius strip as the rectifying developable of a single smooth curve,
as in the second image above.  The third image shows what is happening with the Frenet-Serret frame.
The red vector would change direction at the inflection point, <i>I</i>,  if we simply defined it as 
<b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>)/|<b>c</b>&#39;&#39;(<i>u</i>)|, but we multiply it with a sign that makes it continuous as it crosses that point.  However, as a result of that single change of sign, it no longer agrees with its original direction
when it comes full circle; it needs to traverse the loop <b>twice</b> before that happens.  This
is accompanied by a similar change in the Darboux vector, so the ruling lines reverse orientation after
a single circuit around the loop, making the surface a Möbius strip.</p>
<p>The function we have chosen for the <i>y</i> coordinate of the curve might look a bit strange and arbitrary at first glance:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>y</i>(<i>t</i>) = cos(<i>t</i>) + (2/5) cos(2<i>t</i>) + (1/15) cos(3<i>t</i>)
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, this is the simplest trigonometric function
with a Taylor series at π that is a constant plus a sixth-order term:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>y</i>(π + ε) ≈ –2/3 + (1/3) ε<sup>6</sup>  
</blockquote>
<p>This produces an inflection point at π with suitable behaviour for the curvature and torsion:
both go to zero, but the torsion must go to zero at least as rapidly as the curvature, in order for the width of the strip we can fit around the centreline, <span>|1 / d(τ(<i>s</i>)/κ(<i>s</i>))/d<i>s</i>|,</span> to remain non-zero.
Because we have chosen to make the curve symmetrical under a
180° rotation around the <i>y</i>-axis, the torsion must be an even function of ε, so the lowest
order it can have is quadratic.</p>

κ(π + ε) ≈ (4/(5√5)) |ε|</blockquote>

<h4>Möbius strips and Klein’s bottles in four dimensions</h4>

<p>Although this web page is focused on surfaces embedded in three-dimensional space, we will note
that embeddings in four dimensions allow for more possibilities.  Intrinsically flat surfaces in
four dimensions need not be ruled surfaces, and some topologies that cannot be embedded in three
dimensions because the surface will unavoidably intersect itself can be embedded in four dimensions.</p>
<p>Consider the following surface embedded in four dimensions, parameterised as:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b>(<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) = (cos <i>u</i> cos <i>v</i>, sin <i>u</i> cos <i>v</i>,
2 cos(<i>u</i>/2) sin <i>v</i>, 2 sin(<i>u</i>/2) sin <i>v</i>)
</blockquote>
<p>In four dimensions, we can still use the methods described in the <a href="#Appendix">appendix</a> to find the metric:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b><sub><i>u</i></sub> = (–sin <i>u</i> cos <i>v</i>, cos <i>u</i> cos <i>v</i>,
–sin(<i>u</i>/2) sin <i>v</i>, cos(<i>u</i>/2) sin <i>v</i>)</blockquote>
<p>While we <i>could</i> proceed to compute the Gaussian curvature from the metric with the whole apparatus of
Christoffel symbols and the Riemann curvature tensor described in the
<a href="#GCM">second appendix</a>, we don’t actually need to do all that work to conclude that the surface is intrinsically
flat! The metric is already almost in the form of the two-dimensional Euclidean metric, except for the
<i>g</i><sub>22</sub> component, which is a function of the second parameter <i>v</i>, rather than being 1.</p>
<p>But if we changed to a new parameter in place of <i>v</i> that measured arc length along each curve of
varying <i>v</i> and constant <i>u</i>, then <i>g</i><sub>22</sub> would become 1, and the metric would be precisely the Euclidean metric, since this change would have no effect on the other components.</p>
<p>What is the topology of this surface?  If we allow <i>u</i> to range from 0 to 2π, and <i>v</i>
to range from –<i>V</i> to <i>V</i> for some value of <i>V</i> greater than 0 and strictly less
than π, then we can examine how the two ends, <i>u</i> = 0 and <i>u</i> = 2π, of the coordinate
rectangle are related in the embedding:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b>(0, <i>v</i>) = (cos <i>v</i>, 0, 2 sin <i>v</i>, 0)</blockquote>
<p>We see that the two ends coincide, but with the value of the <i>v</i> coordinate negated, which amounts to a 180° twist. This is precisely
the topology of a Möbius strip.</p>
<p>What if we set <i>V</i> = π, widening the strip so that <i>v</i> ranges from –π to π?
We then have the other two sides of the coordinate rectangle meeting:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b>(<i>u</i>, –π) = (–cos <i>u</i>, –sin <i>u</i>, 0, 0)</blockquote>
<p>Since these sides meet up with no change in orientation, this shows that the surface has closed up
into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_bottle" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">Klein’s bottle</a>.  Of course, it remains intrinsically flat, and there are no self-intersections (other than
the required meeting of the borders of the coordinate rectangle).  The “tube” of the Klein’s bottle
is generated by taking an ellipse, given by the curve for varying <i>v</i> at <i>u</i> = 0:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b>(0, <i>v</i>) = (cos <i>v</i>, 0, 2 sin <i>v</i>, 0)
</blockquote>
<p>and applying a continuous family of four-dimensional rotations to it, by an angle of
<i>u</i> in the <i>xy</i> plane and an angle of <i>u</i>/2 in the <i>zw</i> plane.</p>
<p>The animation at the start of this section shows a single, rigid Möbius strip
with this embedding, but it is projected down to three dimensions using the basis:</p>
<blockquote>
{(0, 0, cos α, sin α), (1, 0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0, 0)}
</blockquote>
<p>with α cyling from 0 to 2π over the course of the animation.
To be clear, these projections to three-dimensional space are <b>not</b> intrinsically flat.</p>

<h2>Intrinsically Curved Surfaces</h2>

<h3>Surfaces of Revolution</h3>
<p>We will start our exploration of surfaces of constant <b>non-zero</b> Gaussian curvature by looking for examples that can
be produced by taking a planar curve and rotating it around an axis.  This will certainly <b>not</b> encompass all the surfaces
we want to catalogue, eventually, but the advantage of starting here is to find some examples while keeping the
mathematics relatively simple, as these surfaces of revolution can be described with a single function of one variable.</p>
<p>One way to parameterise a surface of revolution is to describe the <i>z</i> coordinate as a function of the
radial cylindrical coordinate, ρ, i.e. the distance from the axis.  While we could reverse this, and describe the
radius as a function of <i>z</i>, or, to allow for completely general curves, describe both ρ and <i>z</i> as functions of some
parameter, the approach we have chosen will make our calculations easier, and the results simpler to express.</p>
<p>So, we will parameterise our surface as:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b>(φ, ρ) = (ρ cos φ, ρ sin φ, <i>f</i>(ρ)) 
</blockquote>
<p>where the right-hand side here are ordinary Cartesian coordinates, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>.  We have departed from our earlier practice of using (<i>u</i>, <i>v</i>) as the names for the two surface coordinates, in favour of (φ, ρ), which are more suggestive of the geometry, at least for readers who have
been exposed to the conventional choice of symbols for 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylindrical_coordinate_system" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">cylindrical coordinate systems</a>.</p>
<p>Following the usual recipe for computing the Gaussian curvature of an embedded surface (spelled out in the <a href="#GCE">appendix</a>), we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>x</b><sub>φ</sub> = (–ρ sin φ, ρ cos φ, 0)</blockquote>
<p>To produce a surface of constant Gaussian curvature, <i>K</i>, we need to solve the differential equation here
for <i>f</i>(ρ).  As a first step, we can rewrite this as:</p>
<blockquote>
–1/(2 ρ) d(1/(1 + <i>f</i> &#39;(ρ)<sup>2</sup>))/dρ = <i>K</i>
</blockquote>
<p>This is straightfoward to solve for <i>f</i> &#39;(ρ):</p>
<blockquote>
d(1/(1 + <i>f</i> &#39;(ρ)<sup>2</sup>))/dρ = –2 <i>K</i> ρ</blockquote>
<p>Here <i>c</i> is a constant of integration.  The values that <i>c</i> can take while the
quantity inside the square root remains non-negative (for some non-empty range of values for ρ) will depend on the sign of <i>K</i>.  The condition we need to satisfy is:</p>
<blockquote>
0 &lt; –<i>K</i> ρ<sup>2</sup> + <i>c</i> &lt; 1<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say, a parabola centred on ρ = 0 that either points down (if <i>K</i> &gt; 0) or up (if <i>K</i> &lt; 0), and which has a maximum or minimum value of <i>c</i> at ρ = 0, must lie between 0 and 1 for some
non-empty range of values for ρ.</p>
<p>Suppose <i>K</i> = 1/<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>, i.e. the Gaussian curvature takes the positive value that corresponds to a sphere of radius <i>a</i>.  Then <i>c</i> must be greater than zero, or the downwards-pointing parabola will never take on any positive values.  It will be convenient to set <span><i>c</i> = χ<sup>2</sup>.</span>  The range of values for ρ will then be:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>If 0 &lt; χ ≤ 1</td><td></td><td>0 &lt; ρ &lt; <i>a</i> χ</td></tr>
<tr><td>If χ &gt; 1</td><td></td><td><i>a</i> √[χ<sup>2</sup> – 1] &lt; ρ &lt; <i>a</i> χ</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For negative curvature, say <i>K</i> = –1/<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>, we must have <i>c</i> less than 1, or the
upwards-pointing parabola will never take on any values less than 1.  In this case, we will set <span><i>c</i> = 1 – ξ<sup>2</sup>,</span> and the range of values for ρ will be:</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>If 0 &lt; ξ ≤ 1</td><td></td><td>0 &lt; ρ &lt; <i>a</i> ξ</td></tr>
<tr><td>If ξ &gt; 1</td><td></td><td><i>a</i> √[ξ<sup>2</sup> – 1] &lt; ρ &lt; <i>a</i> ξ</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>We can integrate our result for <i>f</i> &#39;(ρ) to find <i>f</i>(ρ).  For the special case <span><i>c</i> = 1,</span>
which is only compatible with positive curvature, so we will set <span><i>K</i> = 1/<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>:</span></p>
<blockquote>
<i>K</i> = 1/<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>   
<i>c</i> = 1</blockquote>
<p>This is just the formula for two quadrants of a circle of radius <i>a</i>, and the resulting surface of revolution is a sphere of radius <i>a</i>, with the <i>z</i> coordinate of its equator given by the constant
of integration <i>z</i><sub>eq</sub>.</p>
<p>For the special case <span><i>c</i> = 0,</span> which is only compatible with negative curvature:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Tractroid</b></blockquote>
<p>This function is called a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractrix" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">tractrix</a>,
and its surface of revolution, a tractroid, is the most famous example of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudosphere" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">pseudosphere</a>:
a surface of constant negative curvature.</p>
<p>If <i>c</i> ≠ 1 and <i>c</i> ≠ 0, we have:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>f</i>(ρ) = <i>z</i><sub>eq</sub> ± √[(1 – <i>c</i>)/<i>K</i>]
(<i>E</i>(arcsin(√[<i>K</i>/<i>c</i>] ρ) | <i>c</i>/(<i>c</i> – 1)) – <i>e</i><sub>0</sub>)</blockquote>
<p>The function <i>E</i> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_integral" target="_top" title="Wikipedia">elliptic integral of the second kind</a>, defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>E</i>(<i>s</i> | <i>m</i>) = ∫<sub>0</sub><sup><i>s</i></sup> √[1 – <i>m</i> sin<sup>2</sup> <i>t</i>] d<i>t</i></blockquote>
<img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/sorPos.png" width="500" height="400" alt="Plots of cross-sections for positive curvature"/>
<p>The <b>image on the right</b> shows cross-sections through the surfaces of revolution of constant
Gaussian curvature <span><i>K</i> = 1/<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>,</span> for a variety of equatorial radii.
Here, <span><i>c</i> = χ<sup>2</sup>,</span> and χ is the maximum
value of <span>ρ/<i>a</i></span> for each curve.</p>
<p>These curves all meet the horizontal axis with vertical tangents, so they can be smoothly
extended by reflection in this axis; for example, the curve for <span>χ = 1</span> will yield a complete sphere.  However, the points at the top of the curve will (in all other cases besides
the sphere) need to be excluded from the surface, with the “poles” for χ &lt; 1 having a local topology like the tip of a cone, and the tops of the curves for χ &gt; 1 giving rise to circular boundaries.</p>
<p>We can compute the lengths of these curves:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>L</i> = ∫<sub>ρ<sub>1</sub></sub><sup>ρ<sub>2</sub></sup> √[1 + <i>f</i> &#39;(ρ)<sup>2</sup>] dρ</blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>If 0 &lt; χ ≤ 1</td><td></td><td><i>L</i> = (π/2) <i>a</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>If χ &gt; 1</td><td></td><td><i>L</i> = (π/2 – arctan(√[χ<sup>2</sup> – 1])) <i>a</i></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>So for χ ≤ 1, this is the same as the meridian from the equator to the pole on a sphere of radius <i>a</i>, while for χ &gt; 1 it is shorter.</p>
<p>What about the surface area?</p>
<blockquote>
<i>A</i> = 2 π ∫<sub>ρ<sub>1</sub></sub><sup>ρ<sub>2</sub></sup> ρ √[1 + <i>f</i> &#39;(ρ)<sup>2</sup>] dρ</blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>If 0 &lt; χ &lt; 1</td><td></td><td><i>A</i> = 2 π <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> χ</td></tr>
<tr><td>If χ ≥ 1</td><td></td><td><i>A</i> = 2 π <i>a</i><sup>2</sup></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For χ &lt; 1, this is less than the hemisphere of a sphere of radius <i>a</i>, while for
χ ≥ 1 it is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Now let’s compute
geodesics on these surfaces.  To start, note that the metric in (φ, ρ) coordinates can be found from
our initial calculations, once we substitute the result for <i>f</i> &#39;(ρ):</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><b>g</b>(φ, ρ)</td><td>=</td>
<td>

</td><td>=</td>
<td>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>  ρ<sup>2</sup> </td>
<td>  0  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>  0 </td>
<td>  1 / (–<i>K</i> ρ<sup>2</sup> + <i>c</i>) </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Because the metric is independent of the φ coordinate, we can find a family of geodesics by imposing the
requirement that each such curve has a conserved quantity:  the dot product of the unit-length tangent to the geodesic and the vector field that corresponds to a uniform increase in the φ coordinate.  We won’t
go through the derivation, but the results are easily checked.  We claim that these curves are geodesics (for <i>c</i> ≠ 0):</p>
<blockquote>
φ<sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>) = φ<sub>0</sub> + arctan((√[<i>c</i>/<i>K</i>] / ρ<sub>0</sub>)  tan(<i>s</i> √<i>K</i>)) / √<i>c</i></blockquote>
<p>To verify this, we compute the coordinates of the tangent to the geodesic:</p>
<blockquote>
φ<sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>) = ρ<sub>0</sub> <i>K</i>
 / (ρ<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> <i>K</i> + (<i>c</i> – ρ<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> <i>K</i>) sin<sup>2</sup>(<i>s</i> √<i>K</i>))</blockquote>
<p>Along these geodesics, the metric becomes:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><b>g</b>(φ<sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>), ρ<sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>))</td><td>=</td>
<td>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td> ρ<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + (<i>c</i>/<i>K</i> – ρ<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup>) sin<sup>2</sup>(<i>s</i> √<i>K</i>) </td>
<td>  0  </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>  0 </td>
<td>  1 / ((<i>c</i> – ρ<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> <i>K</i>) cos<sup>2</sup>(<i>s</i> √<i>K</i>)) </td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>and we have:</p>
<blockquote>
(φ<sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>),  ρ<sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>))<sup><i>T</i></sup> 
<b>g</b>(φ<sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>), ρ<sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>))
(φ<sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>),  ρ<sub><i>G</i></sub>&#39;(<i>s</i>)) = 1</blockquote>
<p>This confirms that the tangent has a length of 1, and that its dot product with the φ coordinate
vector field is a conserved quantity, the constant ρ<sub>0</sub>, that parameterises the family of geodesics.</p>
<p>For <b>positive curvature</b> we can write the geodesics as:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>K</i> = 1/<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>   
<i>c</i> = χ<sup>2</sup></blockquote>
<p>At <i>s</i> = 0, we have (for both positive and negative curvature):</p>
<blockquote>
φ<sub><i>G</i></sub>(0) = φ<sub>0</sub></blockquote>
<p>So at <i>s</i> = 0 the geodesic is tangent to a circle of latitude of radius ρ<sub>0</sub>,
and this is the minimum value of the ρ coordinate for the geodesic.  However,
for surfaces with <span>χ &gt; 1,</span> if we choose a value
for ρ<sub>0</sub> that is less than the minimum value for ρ on the entire surface, <span><i>a</i> √[χ<sup>2</sup> – 1],</span> we still obtain a valid geodesic, but it only exists for
values of <i>s</i> large enough to give valid values for ρ.</p>
<p>For the positive curvature case, we have:</p>
<blockquote>
φ<sub><i>G</i></sub>((π/2) <i>a</i>) = φ<sub>0</sub> + π/(2 χ)</blockquote>
<p>This tells us that after we travel a distance, (π/2) <i>a</i>,
that is the same as the equator-to-pole distance on a sphere of radius <i>a</i>,
we arrive at the equator (the maximum value for ρ).  The metric in (φ, ρ) coordinates
is singular at the equator, but we can calculate the angle between the geodesic and the equator
as a limit:</p>
<blockquote>
cosine of angle between geodesic and circle of latitude</blockquote>
<p>By varying ρ<sub>0</sub>, we can construct a family of geodesics that all
pass through the same point on the equator at various angles.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/QuasiSphere.gif" width="1000" height="500" alt="Positive curvature surfaces of revolution"/></p>
<p>The <b>animation above</b> shows surfaces of revolution, all with the same constant positive curvature, as
the parameter χ cycles between 0.5 and 1.5.  The two views show the same surface from the front and the back.</p>
<p>The Earth has been mapped to these surfaces by a simple isometry:
when χ is less than 1, part of the equator of the Earth, and the full length of each meridian crossing it, is mapped to the equator and meridians on the surface; when χ is greater than 1, the full equator of the Earth,
and part of the equator of <b>a second copy</b> of the Earth, and part of each meridian crossing them, is mapped to the
equator and meridians on the surface.  There is generally a discontinuity in the map along the
midline of the view of the surface from behind, but this is not a boundary or singularity in the surface
itself.  As we mentioned earlier,
the poles for the surfaces with
χ less than 1 are singular points, in a similar way to the tip of a cone, and need to be excluded.
For χ greater than 1 there are two circular
boundaries where ρ hits a non-zero minimum value and the surface cannot be extended.</p>
<p>The red curves are geodesics, fanning out from a point on the equator and then reconverging.  The geodesics are only drawn until they have gone halfway around the axis, or until they have reconverged, whichever is greater.
Regardless of
the value of χ, the geodesics always reconverge after the same distance, <span>π <i>a</i>,</span> but for χ greater than 1
some of the geodesics hit the boundary of the surface and terminate there.  Also, 
the distance <span>π <i>a</i></span> will
no longer correspond to half the length of the equator, and the second reconvergence, at a distance of <span>2π <i>a</i>,</span> will no longer take place at the point where we started.</p>
<p>The equator is always a geodesic, but in general geodesics will only form closed loops of finite length
when χ is <b>rational</b>, since each portion of a geodesic that lies north or south of the equator will
span a longitude of <span>π/χ.</span>  And even for rational values of χ, it might take
a very large number of crossings of the equator before these changes in longitude sum to an integer multiple of <span>2π.</span> This leads to the conclusion that, in general, the shortest geodesic path from
a point <i>P</i> (not on the equator) that wraps around the surface and returns to <i>P</i> will <b>not</b>
be part of a finite loop, which in turn means it must return to <i>P</i> with its tangent pointing in a different direction than when it began.  The angle between the tangent to the geodesic and the circle of
latitude that <i>P</i> lies on must have the same cosine whenever they cross, so if they are not the same angles,
they must be opposites.</p>
<p>So, while the <b>local</b> geometry of these
surfaces is exactly like that of a sphere, the <b>global</b> properties are not the same.
Insects confined to a surface like this, but able to travel distances comparable to the dimensions of the whole surface, could certainly distinguish it from a sphere by suitable “experiments” with geodesics.</p>
<img src="https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/PSP/sorNeg.png" width="500" height="400" alt="Plots of cross-sections for negative curvature"/>
<p>Now let’s consider the case of <b>negative</b> curvature.</p>
<p>The <b>image on the right</b> shows cross-sections through the surfaces of revolution of constant
Gaussian curvature <span><i>K</i> = –1/<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>,</span> for various equatorial radii.
We have set <span><i>c</i> = 1 – ξ<sup>2</sup>,</span> and ξ is the maximum
value of <span>ρ/<i>a</i></span> for each curve.</p>
<p>All of these curves meet the horizontal axis with a slope of zero, so unlike the case with positive curvature,
the surfaces cannot be smoothly extended by reflection here.  For <span>ξ &lt; 1,</span> the surfaces will have a conical
tip at the point of maximum <i>z</i>; for <span>ξ = 1,</span> the tractrix extends to infinity in the <i>z</i> direction.
For <span>ξ &gt; 1,</span> the curves all have a vertical tangent at the minimum radius, <span>ρ = <i>a</i> √[ξ<sup>2</sup> – 1],</span> so they can be extended smoothly there by reflection in a horizontal line at the maximum <i>z</i> value.</p>
<p>The lengths of these curves are:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>L</i> = ∫<sub>ρ<sub>1</sub></sub><sup>ρ<sub>2</sub></sup> √[1 + <i>f</i> &#39;(ρ)<sup>2</sup>] dρ</blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>If 0 &lt; ξ ≤ 1</td><td></td><td><i>L</i> = <i>a</i> arctanh(ξ)</td></tr>
<tr><td>If ξ &gt; 1</td><td></td><td><i>L</i> = <i>a</i> arctanh(1/ξ)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The area of the surface of revolution is:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>A</i> = 2 π ∫<sub>ρ<sub>1</sub></sub><sup>ρ<sub>2</sub></sup> ρ √[1 + <i>f</i> &#39;(ρ)<sup>2</sup>] dρ</blockquote>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>If 0 &lt; ξ &lt; 1</td><td></td><td><i>A</i> = 2 π <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> (1 – √[1 – ξ<sup>2</sup>])</td></tr>
<tr><td>If ξ ≥ 1</td><td></td><td><i>A</i> = 2 π <i>a</i><sup>2</sup></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>For ξ &lt; 1 this is less than the hemisphere of a sphere of radius <i>a</i>, while for
ξ ≥ 1 it is exactly the same.</p>
<p>For <b>negative curvature</b> we can write the geodesics as:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>K</i> = –1/<i>a</i><sup>2</sup>   
<i>c</i> = 1 – ξ<sup>2</sup></blockquote>
<p>We can also compute the special case <i>c</i> = 0, ξ = 1, for geodesics on the tractroid:</p>
<blockquote>
<b>Tractroid</b></blockquote>
<p>As with the positively curved surfaces, in the generic case these geodesics are tangent, at <i>s</i> = 0, to a circle of latitude of radius ρ<sub>0</sub>,
and this is the minimum value of the ρ coordinate for the geodesic.  If <span>ξ &gt; 1</span> and we choose ρ<sub>0</sub> to be less than the minimum value for ρ on the entire surface, <span><i>a</i> √[ξ<sup>2</sup> – 1],</span> we still obtain a valid geodesic, but it only exists for
values of <i>s</i> large enough to give valid values for ρ.</p>
<p>However, unlike the positive curvature case, all geodesics on a given surface do <b>not</b> take the same distance from their point of minimum ρ before they reach the equator.  And the equator itself is <b>not</b> a geodesic; its geodesic curvature (the curvature in terms of the intrinsic geometry, relative to the geodesics, which
are considered to be straight) is the same as its curvature in three-dimensional Euclidean space:  <span>1/(<i>a</i> ξ),</span> the reciprocal of the radius of the equatorial circle.</p>
<p>For <span>ξ ≤ 1,</span> most geodesics will
start and end on the equator.  Meridians will start on the equator and end on the pole, or for <span>ξ = 1</span> will continue to infinity.</p>
<p>For ξ &gt; 1, the surface has a “waist,” a circle of minimum ρ where <span>ρ = <i>a</i> √[ξ<sup>2</sup> – 1].</span> This is clearly a geodesic by symmetry, and if we insert this value for ρ<sub>0</sub> into the formula for the generic ρ<sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>), it becomes constant.  Geodesics with <span>ρ<sub>0</sub> &lt; <i>a</i> √[ξ<sup>2</sup> – 1]</span>
will cross the waist, and have endpoints on the two distinct copies of the equator.  Geodesics with
<span>ρ<sub>0</sub> &gt; <i>a</i> √[ξ<sup>2</sup> – 1]</span> will
never cross the waist, and will start and end on the same copy of the equator.  Geodesics with
<span>ρ<sub>0</sub> = <i>a</i> √[ξ<sup>2</sup> – 1]</span>
that do not start on the waist are asymptotic to it.</p>
<p>As before, the cosine of the angle between a geodesic and any circle of latitude will be
equal to <span>ρ<sub>0</sub> / ρ<sub><i>G</i></sub>(<i>s</i>),</span>
so the cosine of the angle between a geodesic and the equator is <span>ρ<sub>0</sub> / (<i>a</i> ξ).</span>  For <span>ξ &gt; 1</span> the geodesics that cross the waist will be those that make angles greater than <span>arccos √[1 – 1/ξ<sup>2</sup>]</span> with the equator.  If a geodesic leaves the equator at <b>precisely</b> this angle,
it will approach the waist asymptotically, never reaching it but also never returning to the equator.</p>

<p>The <b>animation above</b> shows front and back views of surfaces of revolution with <span><i>K</i> = –1,</span> with the parameter ξ ranging from 1.10125 to 1.70728.  These values have no special significance in terms of the properties of the surface, but they were chosen so that the particular tiling of the hyperbolic
plane used to illustrate the surface wraps around neatly at the two endpoints.  In this tiling, seven equilateral triangles meet at a point, and the equilateral triangles are further subdivided into six right-angled triangles.
This tiling can’t exist in the Euclidean plane, where the angles at each vertex of an equilateral triangle
are always <span>π/3</span> radians, but in the hyperbolic plane the sum of the angles of a triangle will be less than π by an amount that depends on the area of the triangle, as we discussed <a href="#GC">earlier</a>.
For these equilateral triangles with angles of <span>2π/7</span> at each vertex,
for a total of <span>6π/7,</span> the area is <span>π/7.</span></p>
<p>The total area of each of the surfaces in the animation is <span>4π.</span>
The isometries used to map the hyperbolic plane to these surfaces take a fixed geodesic in the hyperbolic plane
to the circle around the waist of the surface, and then map geodesics orthogonal to the first one to meridians
on the surface.</p>
<p>The <b>images on the left and below</b> show some examples of these surfaces rotating, to give a clearer sense of how the negatively curved geometry fits into three-dimensional Euclidean space.</p>
