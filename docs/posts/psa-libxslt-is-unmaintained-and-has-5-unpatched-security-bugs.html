	  <p>2 of the 3 have now been disclosed:</p>
	  <p>(CVE-2025-7424) libxslt: Type confusion in xmlNode.psvi between stylesheet and source nodes</p>
	  <p>(CVE-2025-7425) libxslt: heap-use-after-free in xmlFreeID caused by `atype` corruption</p>
	  <p>Engineers from Apple &amp; Google have proposed patches in the GNOME gitlab issues,
	  but neither has had a fix applied to the git repo since there is currently no
	    maintainer for libxslt.</p>

<p>Note that a fourth vulnerability was reported on June 18, 2025, which remains undisclosed to date (GNOME libxslt issue 148, link below), see
