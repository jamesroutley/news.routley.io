            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>We‚Äôre excited to announce the release of Zulip Server 6.0, containing hundreds of new features and bug fixes!</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2022/03/streams-and-topics-2022-03-23-with-border.png"/><a href="https://zulip.com/">Zulip</a> is an open-source team chat application designed to help people collaborate to solve any challenge. With conversations <a href="https://zulip.com/help/streams-and-topics">organized by topic</a>, Zulip is ideal for both live and asynchronous communication. Fortune 500 companies, leading open-source projects, and thousands of other organizations use Zulip every day. Zulip‚Äôs 100% open-source software is available as a <a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">managed cloud service</a> or a <a href="https://zulip.com/self-hosting/">self-hosted solution</a>.</p>
<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2022/03/streams-and-topics-2022-03-23-with-border.png"/>
<p>Zulip Server 6.0 is a major release, with over 3400 new commits merged across the project since the 5.0 release in March. Notable new features include marking messages as unread, read receipts, new ways to navigate conversations, and much more!</p>
<p>A total of 118 people contributed commits to Zulip since the 5.0 release, bringing the project to over 1150 code contributors. Zulip has by far the most active open-source development community of any team chat software, with <a href="https://zulip.com/team">77 people</a> who‚Äôve contributed 100+ commits.</p>
<p>Huge thanks to everyone who&#39;s <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html">contributed</a> to Zulip over the last few months, whether by writing code and documentation, <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html#reporting-issues">reporting issues</a>, <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/translating/translating.html">translating</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/zulip">supporting us financially</a>, participating in discussions in the <a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">Zulip development community</a>, or just suggesting ideas! We could not do this without the hundreds of people giving back to the Zulip community.</p>

<p>Today marks a release of the Zulip server and web application. We‚Äôd also like to share important news and updates for the project as a whole since the 5.0 release in the spring:</p>
<h3 id="customer-stories">Customer stories</h3>
<ul>
<li>We‚Äôre excited to announce that Zulip is now the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/technology/">official messaging platform</a> for the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/">Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a>, the main organization defining technical standards for the Internet.</li>
<li>This summer, Slack drastically changed its free plan, making it <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2022/08/26/why-slacks-free-plan-change-is-causing-an-exodus/">untenable for many organizations</a>. We have been glad to be able to support many affected organizations by helping them <a href="https://zulip.com/help/import-from-slack">import their Slack data into Zulip</a>, and offering <a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">Zulip Cloud Standard sponsorships</a> for open-source projects, research groups, and other negatively impacted communities.</li>
<li>Our website now features the story of <a href="https://zulip.com/case-studies/recurse-center/">how the Recurse Center uses Zulip</a>. Learn how the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> community <a href="https://zulip.com/case-studies/recurse-center/#choosing-zulip-in-2013-one-of-the-best-decisions-weve-made">helped Zulip become an open-source project</a>, and how Zulip <a href="https://zulip.com/case-studies/recurse-center/#zulip-becomes-the-backbone-of-a-worldwide-community">brings together</a> a worldwide community with hundreds of active participants (with over 2.5 million Zulip messages sent since 2013!).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe core of the Recurse Center is the community, and the core of our online community is Zulip‚Ä¶ Switching to Zulip has turned out to be one of the best decisions we‚Äôve made, and it‚Äôs impossible to imagine RC today without it. No other tool has a user experience that scales to a community of our size.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="apps">Apps</h3>
<p>The Zulip mobile apps for <a href="https://zulip.com/apps/ios">iOS</a> and <a href="https://zulip.com/apps/android">Android</a> have made <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/releases">numerous improvements</a> for a better user experience and a fuller set of Zulip features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for all the new features of Zulip Server 6.0: <a href="https://zulip.com/help/marking-messages-as-unread">mark messages as unread</a>, see <a href="https://zulip.com/help/read-receipts">read receipts</a>, go <a href="https://zulip.com/help/status-and-availability#invisible-mode">invisible</a>, and more.</li>
<li>Support for <a href="https://zulip.com/help/custom-profile-fields">custom profile fields</a> and for creating <a href="https://zulip.com/help/public-access-option">web-public streams</a>.</li>
<li>Still-finer control over <a href="https://zulip.com/help/marking-messages-as-read#configure-whether-messages-are-automatically-marked-as-read">when messages are marked as read</a>, with a new ‚ÄúOnly in conversation views‚Äù option.</li>
<li>More natural emoji search, and fast access to popular emoji. üéâ</li>
<li>Lots of other improvements, including many fixed bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip-terminal#readme">Zulip Terminal</a> features new since the Zulip Server 5.0 release include the ability to download and open attachments, showing the names of users who reacted to a message (also a new feature in other Zulip apps), and a keyboard shortcut that makes it easy to <a href="https://zulip.com/help/mastering-the-compose-box#go-to-conversation">go to the conversation you‚Äôre composing to</a>.</p>
<h3 id="learning-about-zulip">Learning about Zulip</h3>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://zulip.com/history/">Zulip history page</a> now traces Zulip‚Äôs story from its first founding, to acquisition by Dropbox, release as open source, second founding as an independent mission-driven company, and how Zulip has developed into a thriving open-source project.</li>
<li>Our new <a href="https://zulip.com/values/">Values</a> page describes the values that are behind everything we do as we work to build the world‚Äôs best team chat software, including building software that will always be there for our users, and always keeping Zulip 100% open-source.</li>
<li>We have launched the <a href="https://zulip.com/communities/">Zulip communities directory</a>. You can visit any of the communities that have <a href="https://zulip.com/help/communities-directory">opted in to be listed</a> to learn more about them. If you are involved in an <a href="https://zulip.com/help/communities-directory#eligibility">open Zulip community</a>, we encourage you to advertise it and support the Zulip project by <a href="https://zulip.com/help/communities-directory#change-whether-your-organization-may-be-listed-in-the-zulip-communities-directory">adding your community to the list</a>!</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mentorship">Mentorship</h3>
<p>Our community is <a href="https://github.com/showcases/great-for-new-contributors">fully committed</a> to helping bring up the next generation of open-source contributors. 2022 was the 7th consecutive year that Zulip participated in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a>. Our 15 GSoC 2022 participants <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2022/11/02/google-summer-of-code-2022/">contributed</a> to many of the features described in this post, and we‚Äôre looking forward to <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/outreach/overview.html">welcoming</a> the next cohorts of <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">GSoC</a> and <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> participants.</p>
<blockquote><p>‚ÄúThe openness to constructive feedback, the super comprehensive developer documentation, coupled with the vibrant, helpful developer community, and the trust reposed in and the flexibility granted to contributors, makes for an incomparable experience.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We proudly sponsor free <a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">Zulip Cloud Standard hosting</a> for about 1000 <a href="https://zulip.com/for/open-source/">open-source projects</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/for/communities/">non-profits</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/for/education/">educational institutions</a>, and <a href="https://zulip.com/for/research/">academic research groups</a>. All eligible organizations are encouraged to <a href="https://zulip.com/accounts/go/?next=/upgrade%23sponsorship">join the program</a>!</p>


<ul>
<li>You can now <a href="https://zulip.com/help/marking-messages-as-unread">mark messages as unread</a> both on web and on mobile. This makes it easy to return to a conversation later if you don&#39;t have time to read it carefully, or to follow up on action items. The ‚Äúmark as unread‚Äù feature works everywhere in Zulip ‚Äî for example, you can also use it to mark the results of your <a href="https://zulip.com/help/search-for-messages">search</a> as unread to review them at leisure.</li>
<li>You can see <a href="https://zulip.com/help/read-receipts">read receipts</a> for any message, no matter who sent it or where it was sent. With privacy in mind, Zulip lets you <a href="https://zulip.com/help/read-receipts#configure-whether-zulip-lets-others-see-when-youve-read-messages">control</a> whether your read receipts are shared, and administrators can <a href="https://zulip.com/help/read-receipts#configure-whether-read-receipts-are-enabled-in-your-organization">choose</a> whether to enable read receipts in their organization.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="improved-navigation">Improved navigation</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can now see all your recent conversations in one place, including both <a href="https://zulip.com/help/streams-and-topics">stream messages</a> and <a href="https://zulip.com/help/private-messages">private messages</a>. The <a href="https://zulip.com/help/recent-conversations">‚ÄúRecent conversations‚Äù view</a> replaces ‚ÄúRecent topics‚Äù, which only included stream messages. Keyboard navigation was also improved.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2022/11/recent-conversations.png" alt="recent-conversations" loading="lazy"/></p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2022/11/left-sidebar.png"/>The left sidebar has been redesigned to make it easier to navigate your conversations.
<ul>
<li>You can now immediately <a href="https://zulip.com/help/reading-pms">see which private message conversations have new messages</a>, and jump to those conversations with one click.</li>
<li>Topics with unread @-mentions are indicated with an <code>@</code> symbol.</li>
<li>Streams in the left sidebar are organized into labeled ‚Äú<a href="https://zulip.com/help/pin-a-stream">Pinned</a>‚Äù, ‚ÄúActive‚Äù and ‚Äú<a href="https://zulip.com/help/manage-inactive-streams">Inactive</a>‚Äù sections, with <a href="https://zulip.com/help/mute-a-stream">muted streams</a> sorted to the bottom of each section.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2022/11/left-sidebar.png"/>
<ul>
<li>Zulip is unusual among chat apps in letting you compose a message to a different conversation than the one you‚Äôre looking at. This is especially handy when you want to reference information from another conversation, or <a href="https://zulip.com/help/link-to-a-message-or-conversation#link-to-a-message-or-conversation">cross-link</a> related topics. For convenience, in addition to a <a href="https://zulip.com/help/keyboard-shortcuts#narrowing">keyboard shortcut</a>, there is now a button for <a href="https://zulip.com/help/mastering-the-compose-box#go-to-conversation">going to the conversation</a> where you‚Äôre sending your message.</li>
<li>A new <a href="https://zulip.com/help/reading-topics">Scroll to bottom button</a> lets you quickly jump to the bottom of your current view, automatically <a href="https://zulip.com/help/marking-messages-as-read#mark-all-messages-as-read">marking all messages in the view as read</a>, just like the <code>End</code> keyboard shortcut.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="better-user-cards-and-profiles">Better user cards and profiles</h2>
<ul>
<li>Organizations can now <a href="https://zulip.com/help/custom-profile-fields#display-custom-fields-in-user-profile-summaries">select up to two custom profile fields</a> to be featured on the <a href="https://zulip.com/help/user-cards">user card</a>. It‚Äôs a great way to make it easy to find key information, such as someone‚Äôs pronouns, team name or role, or GitHub username. There is also a new ‚ÄúPronouns‚Äù custom profile field type, which provides some common pronouns, but also allows free-form text.</li>
<li>You can now turn on ‚Äú<a href="https://zulip.com/help/status-and-availability#invisible-mode">Invisible mode</a>‚Äù to appear offline to others while using Zulip. This mode combines the best aspects of two previous features for communicating to others about your availability.</li>
<li>User <a href="https://zulip.com/help/user-cards">cards</a> and <a href="https://zulip.com/help/view-someones-profile">profiles</a> for users and bots have been redesigned with a cleaner look, and additional information and management functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="public-access-option-out-of-beta">Public access option out of beta</h2>
<p>With the <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2022/05/05/public-access-option/">public access option</a>, organizations can set Zulip streams to be viewable by anyone on the Internet without creating an account. This option is now out of beta, with many enhancements, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-click logged-out access to public links, bypassing the login page. You are asked to log in only when you attempt an action that cannot be done anonymously, such as posting a message.</li>
<li>Logged-out visitors can now choose between light and dark theme, and select their preferred language for the Zulip app.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-experience-improvements">User experience improvements</h2>
<p>Here are a few more highlights from the hundreds of user experience improvements in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs often helpful to see who reacted to a message, for example when waiting for a üëç from a decision maker. Zulip now <a href="https://zulip.com/help/emoji-reactions#toggle-whether-names-of-reacting-users-are-displayed">shows the names of users</a> who reacted to a message when there are not too many to display, eliminating the need to mouse over emoji reactions.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2022/11/emoji-reactions.png" alt="emoji-reactions" loading="lazy"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Zulip now supports the latest emoji up to Unicode 14, including üßµ, üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è, and ü§Ø. Users who were still using the deprecated ‚ÄúGoogle blobs‚Äù emoji set, which is no longer being updated with new emoji, are automatically migrated to the modern ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù emoji set. (It‚Äôs still possible to <a href="https://zulip.com/help/emoji-and-emoticons#change-your-emoji-set">switch back</a> to ‚ÄúGoogle blobs‚Äù if desired.)</li>
<li>The right sidebar now shows <a href="https://zulip.com/help/status-and-availability#statuses">user status messages</a> by default, with an alternative compact design available.</li>
<li><a href="https://zulip.com/help/email-notifications">Message notification emails</a> now explain more clearly why the notification was sent. It has always been possible to send a Zulip message by replying to a notification, and you can now reply several times to the same email, with no time limit.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The interface for moving messages to a different <a href="https://zulip.com/help/move-content-to-another-topic">topic</a> or <a href="https://zulip.com/help/move-content-to-another-stream">stream</a> has been completely redesigned to be easier to use. There is also additional flexibility and better defaults for when to send automated notices about moving messages. Plus, the message menu has been revamped to make it quick to find the action you are looking for.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://blog.zulip.com/content/images/2022/11/move-messaegs.png" alt="move-messaegs" loading="lazy"/></p>
<ul>
<li>The settings menu now displays basic details about the Zulip organization, including its name, URL, and the <a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">Zulip Cloud plan</a> or self-hosted server version.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://zulip.com/help/analytics">usage statistics page</a> for an organization now includes a summary of key statistics, such as the total number of users and messages.</li>
<li>When <a href="https://zulip.com/help/deactivate-or-reactivate-a-user">deactivating a user</a>, administrators can now see which bots and open invitations will be automatically disabled, and can send a notification email to the user being deactivated.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://zulip.com/help/review-your-organization-settings">organization settings menu</a> has been updated to make it easier to find the right panel, and all destructive actions (e.g., deactivating a user or bot) now have a confirmation dialog.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2>
<ul>
<li>When setting up an <a href="https://zulip.com/api/incoming-webhooks-overview">incoming webhook integration</a>, you can now filter out the events you don‚Äôt want to receive, which is invaluable when the third-party service doesn‚Äôt support configuring which events to send to Zulip.</li>
<li>We have added new <a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/azuredevops">Azure DevOps</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/rhodecode">RhodeCode</a>, and <a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/wekan">Wekan</a> integrations.</li>
<li>Several integrations have been improved, including <a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/grafana">Grafana</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/harbor">Harbor</a>, <a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/newrelic">NewRelic</a>, and the <a href="https://zulip.com/integrations/doc/slack_incoming">Slack compatible incoming webhook</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="self-hosting">Self-hosting</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have added support for Ubuntu 22.04, and removed support for Debian 10 and PostgreSQL 10 due to their approaching end-of-life upstream. See our <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-the-operating-system">OS upgrade documentation</a> and <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-postgresql">PostgreSQL upgrade documentation</a> for instructions on how to correctly upgrade your Zulip server if needed.</li>
<li>Footers for login pages, help center documentation, and other pages have been customized to provide the appropriate information and links for self-hosted servers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="internationalization">Internationalization</h2>
<p>Our community translators have been hard at work keeping up with the product as it evolves. This release features new or much more complete translations for Arabic, Mongolian, Serbian and Vietnamese, bringing the project to a total of 27 languages with translations that cover the majority of non-error strings.</p>

<p>We <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/release-lifecycle.html#compatibility-and-upgrading">highly recommend</a> upgrading to Zulip Server 6.0 to take advantage of the hundreds of improvements in this release. If you&#39;re using Zulip Cloud, you already have the new version, as we constantly upgrade it with improvements as they become ready.</p>
<p>We work hard to ensure that upgrades are smooth; you can upgrade by following the straightforward <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release">upgrade instructions</a>. The <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#upgrade-notes">upgrade notes section of the changelog</a> details changes you‚Äôll want to understand before upgrading.</p>
<p>Many installations have already upgraded to release candidates, so we feel very confident in this release. But if you need help, best-effort support is available on <a href="https://zulip.com/development-community/">chat.zulip.org</a>. You can also purchase <a href="https://zulip.com/plans/">commercial support</a> from the Zulip core team.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre hard at work on a major redesign of Zulip‚Äôs web and mobile apps. Our goal is to give Zulip a clean, contemporary feel, while preserving all the thoughtful usability details that our users love. Check out issues tagged with the ‚Äúredesign‚Äù label in the <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aredesign">web</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aredesign">mobile</a> repositories to see where we‚Äôre headed, and <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/design-discussions.html">join the conversations</a> in the Zulip development community to offer feedback.</p>
<p>On the backend, work continues on <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/19525">changing</a> how permissions work in Zulip to be built on fully custom, hierarchically-organized user groups. This will make Zulip‚Äôs permissions system flexible enough to implement just about any organizational policy.</p>
<h2 id="release-schedule">Release schedule</h2>
<p>This release is coming out just under eight months after the Zulip Server 5.0 release in <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2022/03/29/zulip-5-0-released/">March 2022</a>. This is an improvement compared to the ten-month gap between Zulip 4.0 and Zulip 5.0. However, we plan to continue iterating on our release management practices to support more frequent major releases. This way, self-hosting users will be able to benefit from Zulip‚Äôs rapid pace of improvement without undue delay.</p>
