    <h1>Scammed by the top result for &#39;Bitcoin wallet&#39; in Apple App Store</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Earlier today I decided to switch my Android for an iPhone. After moving all my apps I decided to make the jump and move my bitcoin from the android wallet. I searched for &#39;bitcoin wallet&#39; on the Apple App Store, installed the first app I saw (as far as I could tell, looks legit), transferred bitcoin, and it immediately got sent off. Turns out this app was previously reported at least 12 days ago as a scam ( https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1b3q5wr/fake_wallet_on_apple_app_store/ ) but its still up there, #1 search result.</p><p>I get that I&#39;ve failed to vet the app but honestly, how does a scam app become the #1 organic search result (not promoted) in the app store, topping binance, blockchain.com, and coinbase?</p><p>EDIT: linking to a screen recording that includes this post and comments of no repro:</p><p>Before removing the app - https://streamable.com/q2mulu</p><p>After removing the app - https://streamable.com/y5nhy7</p></div></div></div>
