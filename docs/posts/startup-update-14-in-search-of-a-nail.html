<h2 id="progress-update">Progress update</h2>
<p>This week, I published what I have of the AP chemistry course, and
then started looking around at competing education products. I wanted to
understand the very complex Venn diagram of existing products, target
markets, competitors’ features, my features, and figure out what my
differentiating features were, so I could start tuning a marketing
message.</p>
<p>I realized then that I’d been going at this just completely backwards
the whole time. Instead of building an AI course and then trying to find
an audience for it, I really should have just started with the marketing
message and then built the product around that… Really stupidly obvious
in hindsight, and now I’m back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>This time, I’m focusing directly at the chemistry olympiad prep
market, which I estimate to be pretty tiny (probably a 1M ARR market),
but is a tractable enough space that I can actually just analyze all of
the market offerings and likely make something better. I’ve done the
research, figured out all of the existing
products/services/people/offerings in this sector, as well as used a
bunch of similar products from adjacent, better resourced sectors (math
olympiad prep, software interview/coding competition prep), and have
found the relevant communities/discord channels where chemistry olympiad
kids are actually hanging out. Based on this research, I have a list of
features for an MVP. The marketing message is simple: “the best way to
prepare for the chemistry olympiad”. Given how tiny the market is, the
bar is pretty low here.</p>
<p>This week, I’ll try to get out this MVP of a problem solving
interface that is superior to anything currently existing for chemistry
olympiad students. I might dump the backend/frontend I developed over
the past month, just to maximize dev speed. I have all of the learnings
on how to use LLMs to teach classes, as well as the raw content (course
curriculum/lesson sketches + problems + solution generating routines),
so it’s not a big loss.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-on-the-fragmented-state-of-education">Thoughts on the
fragmented state of education</h2>
<p>I am starting to realize “education” is an umbrella market in the
same sense that “cancer” is an umbrella disease.</p>
<p>In any organism, every system needs to stay healthy and functioning,
which typically means some mix of cell repair, replication, and refresh.
Different cells have different natural lifecycles, environmental
exposures, and propensity to damage. “Cancer” is a failure of this
process in some subset of cells. The treatment method for any cancer is
a very specific function of the type of cell, type of mutation,
proximity/accessibility of various treatment routes, and so on.</p>
<p>In modern civilization, every person needs to become and remain
gainfully employed, even as the market for jobs shifts over time.
Different professions have different Schelling points defining the
qualifications for a job, whether it is a certification, a license, a
degree, or an exam score. The market is often free to decide that a
specific qualification is no longer serving its purpose and start
requiring a different qualification. Every time somebody needs to
realign their resume with the necessary qualifications, we call this
“education”. Education products are a very specific function of the
desired job, type of qualification needed, student ability, existing
skillset, and availability of time.</p>
<p>The fragmented state of education is a reflection of a healthy and
diverse job market. Chemistry is relevant for pre-meds hoping to do well
in the MCAT, for chemistry undergrads hoping to do well on the GRE, for
high schoolers hoping to get good scores on the AP/IB chemistry exams,
or even for software engineers trying to pivot into climate work, but
all of these are really different markets, and hard to target with a
single tool.</p>
<p>I would even argue that education is <em>not fragmented enough</em>.
In the U.S., K-12 and then four years of college is the baseline
expectation for a variety of professions, when it shouldn’t be. Outside
of the U.S., medical degrees typically do <em>not</em> require an
undergraduate degree, and I think given the stupidly long timelines of
medical school + residency + fellowship that most U.S. doctors go
through, four additional years in undergrad is really overkill.
Vocational/trade schools probably shouldn’t even require the completion
of high school. Ultimately, educational products that reduce the amount
of time required to satisfy unnecessary requirements are probably a net
gain to society.</p>
