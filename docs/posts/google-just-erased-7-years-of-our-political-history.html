            <p>Google appears to have deleted its political ad archive for the EU; so the last 7 years of ads, of political spending, of messaging, of targeting - on YouTube, on Search and for display ads - for countless elections across 27 countries - is all gone. </p><p>We had been told that Google would try to stop people placing political ads, a &#34;ban&#34; that was to come into effect this week. I did not read anywhere that this would mean the erasure of this archive of our political history. </p><p>When you go to the Google Ad Archive (which you can here: <a href="https://adstransparency.google.com/?region=IE&amp;ref=thebriefing.ie">https://adstransparency.google.com/</a>) until last week you could search all political ads shown in your country by a date range of your choosing going back to 2018. You could browse all the ads in that range, or search for keywords, candidates, parties. You could view each ad - watch the video, see the images - who had been targeted, how much had been spent etc. </p><p>Now when you try to click on &#34;political ads&#34; you get re-directed to a page asking you to select from a small number of countries - the US, of course, UK, India, Australia, Brazil, Israel - but not one EU country (see below): </p><figure><img src="https://www.thebriefing.ie/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-28-at-10.38.47.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="585" height="819"/><figcaption><span>The page you are diverted too if you try to find political ads on Google. </span></figcaption></figure><p>The political ad archive - now deleted? - allowed people like me (and many others) to understand what happened in elections, like this longer piece I was able to write during the European &amp; Local elections last year on the use of YouTube by a far right party, Sinn Féin&#39;s big push on search result ads, and the growth of attacks ads in Ireland: </p><figure><a href="https://www.thebriefing.ie/campaign-round-up-google-youtube-ad-spend/"><div><p>Campaign round up: Irish Freedom Party dominating YouTube ad spend</p><p>The Irish Freedom Party spent €4,100 in the past 3 weeks on YouTube ads, the biggest spenders on YouTube ads this election.</p><p><img src="https://www.thebriefing.ie/content/images/icon/tb-logos-61.png" alt=""/><span>Liz Carolan</span></p></div><p><img src="https://www.thebriefing.ie/content/images/thumbnail/Website-1920x1080-7.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = &#39;none&#39;"/></p></a></figure><p>Now you need the specific name of an advertiser, and when I looked for, for example, &#34;Sinn Fein&#34;, it (a) only gave me the option of searching for their website, and (b) showed zero results. This is despite Sinn Fein spending upwards of <a href="https://www.thebriefing.ie/ad-spend-roundup-and-last-minute-shenanigans/" rel="noreferrer">€10k a day during some of the elections last year</a>. </p><figure><img src="https://www.thebriefing.ie/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-28-at-11.17.51.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="850" height="496" srcset="https://www.thebriefing.ie/content/images/size/w600/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-28-at-11.17.51.png 600w, https://www.thebriefing.ie/content/images/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-28-at-11.17.51.png 850w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><span>Google no longer share any data on Irish political party and candidate spending on political ads on their platform; as shown here, a search for &#34;Sinn Fein&#34; returns &#34;no ads found&#34; </span></figcaption></figure><p>Some good things have been written about the impact that an ad &#34;ban&#34; might have on campaigning, especially when the algorithm still dominates all major social platforms (see this <a href="https://www.liberties.eu/en/stories/meta-google-advertising-bans/45513?ref=thebriefing.ie" rel="noreferrer">great piece</a> by the Civil Liberties Union for Europe), </p><p>But the ad archives were introduced 7 years ago for a reason - in no small part because of the chaos of the Brexit and Trump 2016 votes, and our own advocacy here in Ireland about interference in the 2018 8th amendment referendum. </p><p>They were introduced to allow for scrutiny of campaigns, and also to provide a historical record so we could go back and look at what had been promised, and what had been spent, and to see if this lined up with what happened later. </p><p>This erasure of our political past feels dangerous, for scrutiny, for accountability, for shared memory, for enforcement of our rules - for our democracy. </p><h2 id="icymi">ICYMI </h2><figure><a href="https://www.thebriefing.ie/campaigning-likes-it-1999-when-it-feels-like-its-1938/"><div><p>Campaigning likes it 1999 (when it feels like its 1938)</p><p>How do you run a political campaign without digital ads?
