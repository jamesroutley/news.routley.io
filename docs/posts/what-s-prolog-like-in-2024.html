    <h1>Ask HN: What&#39;s Prolog Like in 2024?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi, i am a compsci student that stumbled upon prolog and logic programming during my studies.</p><p>While i have seen the basics of vanilla prolog (atoms, predicates, cuts, lists and all that jazz) and a godawful implementation of an agent communication system that works on SICStus prolog. I would like to know more because i think that this language might be a powerhouse in per se.</p><p>Since my studies are quite basic in this regards i would like to expand my knowledge on it and kind of specialize myself both in this world and another world (ontologies :D) that i really enjoy.</p><p>What&#39;s prolog like in 2024? what are you wonderful people doing with it?</p><p>thanks from a dumbass :D</p></div></div></div>
