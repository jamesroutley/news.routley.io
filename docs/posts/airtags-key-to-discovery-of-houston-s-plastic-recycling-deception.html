          <p>One Houston resident was suspicious of the city&#39;s &#34;all plastic accepted&#34; recycling program, and used <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/airtags" title="AirTag" data-kpt="1">AirTags</a> to discover where the plastic waste actually ended up.
</p><p>Deason, who regularly recycles her packaging and other waste, began to have doubts about the city&#39;s plastic recycling program. Houston&#39;s program boasted of being able to accept even types of plastic that aren&#39;t normally considered recyclable.
</p><p>Curious as to where the plastic was going, she bought a set of AirTags, and included them in various bags of her plastic recycling. Of the bags she tracked, nearly all of them went to a company called Wright Waste Management, located in nearby Harris County.
</p><p>The company is not approved to store plastic waste, and has failed three fire inspections.
</p><p>CBS News correspondent Ben Tracy <a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/houston-recycling-tracking-device-plastic/">referred</a> to Deason as &#34;the James Bond of plastic recycling&#34; for her initiative. Aerial footage showed that the facility had large piles of plastic waste as tall as 10 feet high.
</p><p>Deason said she thought that the company simply storing the unrecyclable plastic waste was &#34;kind of strange.&#34; She later contacted Houston&#39;s Director of Solid Waste Management Mark Wilfalk, to ask about the discrepancy.
</p><p>When shown the drone footage, Wilfalk admitted &#34;it&#39;s not the most desirable-looking site.&#34; He promised Deason he&#39;d investigate the problems that caused Wright Waste Management to fail the fire inspections.
</p><p>Wilfalk later acknowledged that the city had collected some 250 tons of plastic since the end of 2022. He revealed that none of it had been recycled as of yet.
</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re gonna stockpile it for now,&#34; he admitted. &#34;We&#39;re gonna see what happens.&#34;
</p><p>By contrast, Apple has been an <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/04/16/apple-highlights-device-recycling-iphone-trade-in-and-the-removal-of-leather-for-earth-day" title="Apple&#39;s environmental efforts">industry leader</a> in reducing its use of plastic. It uses paper for packaging, and metal rather than plastic for its computer line.
</p><p>It does use some plastic for products such as its <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/airpods" title="AirPods" data-kpt="1">AirPods</a> earbuds. It has invested in robotics to help recycle old Apple products.
</p><p>Houston, as it turns out, is waiting on a promised sorting facility to open, where the stored recycling will be sorted and treated. The company behind the sorting facility, Cyclix, says it has developed a method to create recyclable pellets out of the plastic waste.
</p><p>However, only a fraction of these pellets can be made into new plastic. Most will be melted and turned into fuel that is burned, adding to carbon emissions.
</p><p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta has been investigating Cyclix owner and plastic manufacturer ExxonMobil&#39;s claims regarding plastic recycling in that state. He has characterized Cyclix&#39;s claims of plastic recycling are largely fictional.</p>
