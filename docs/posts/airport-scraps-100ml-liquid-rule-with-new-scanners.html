consumer expert Harry Kind said while it was the &#34;beginning of the end&#34; of a system introduced 17 years ago, people should not assume it was a rule change across the board. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It&#39;s really important passengers actually check what the rules are for the airports they&#39;re flying from and flying to,&#34; he said. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But crucially it should reduce waiting times. Many travellers reported delays of up to an hour at security, and in a recent <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/reviews/airports/article/uk-airports/best-and-worst-uk-airports-amiss8P8bbwx">Which? survey</a> 7% said they had missed a flight because of queues, Mr Kind added.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;This change will make a massive difference and reduce the number of people missing flights and losing out on their holidays just because they&#39;ve got a too big bottle of shampoo.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>London City Airport was already the fastest of the UK airports it surveyed for security times, with an average of 12 minutes, he added. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The largest of the UK&#39;s airports are rolling out the next generation technology on a gradual basis.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Heathrow trialled 3D scanners in 2017 and said with more security lanes than any other airport installing the new machines was &#34;always going to be complex and take longer&#34;.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Gatwick is currently trialling one lane with next generation technology and a spokesperson said passengers should continue to follow all existing rules.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Other airports told the BBC they had no specific date for completion but would be in line with the government deadline of June 2024. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The technology has already been in use by airports in the US, such as Atlanta&#39;s Hartsfield-Jackson and Chicago&#39;s O&#39;Hare, for a number of years.</p></div><section data-component="related-internet-links"><p><h2>Related Internet Links</h2></p><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li></ul><p>The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.</p></section></article></main></div></div>
