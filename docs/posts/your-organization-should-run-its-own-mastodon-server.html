    <h1>Your Organization should run its own Mastodon server</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Whether you are a large company, a political party, an international news
    agency, an NGO or a government institution, you should seriously consider
    running your own Mastodon server, or anything else that suits your business on
    the Fediverse.</p>

<p><a href="https://joinmastodon.org">Mastodon</a> is in the news every time Twitter
    changes something big enough to upset its users. Recently, the takeover by Elon
    Musk has got millions wondering if the social media platform so cherished by
    journalists is still worth their attention. Hundreds of thousands of them have
    decided to test a software called Mastodon, a federated open source alternative
    to Twitter.</p>

<p>But isn’t this all too familiar? We spend so much effort building communities
    on these large social networks, and by that we make ourselves very dependent on
    their operating model. Facebook changes the way they serve fan pages to their
    users and it’s hundreds of news agencies scratching their heads on how they’re
    going to get their latest articles in front of their readers. Struggling to get
    your official account stand out in the middle of all the copycats, you can
    always pay for some certifying blue check symbol. What about having your own
    messages censored or displayed next to an advert for something you are actually
    trying to distance yourself from?</p>

<p>You’ve already been told that it’s better to own your channels of
    communication and that’s why you are probably already running your own
    newsletter. But what about social media? Can you run your own social network?
    How do you connect to millions of people without using Facebook or Twitter?</p>

<p>This is where Mastodon and the Fediverse bring a completely new way to think
    about social media. The Fediverse is a network of thousands of servers running
    some social media software, like Mastodon, a microblogging tool often compared
    to Twitter. And all are interconnected with each other. So, instead of having
    one centralized platform, we have a network of social networks. And just as with
    email, you can send a message to anyone in your organization, and at the same
    time have a conversation with anyone outside of your organization. All this is
    transparent and your correspondent’s email address lets you know that you are
    actually talking to someone as part of a particular organization.</p>

<p>You see immediately one of the benefits. By using your own domain name, your
    brand, you are creating a recognizable social presence in the Fediverse, without
    the need to associate it with facebook.com, twitter.com or instagram.com. No
    need to worry about someone else squatting your name either. Your domain name is
    what will get people to trust that the Mastodon accounts under it are legitimate
    and official.</p>



<p>And once you run your own corner of a social network, you can decide who you
    invite there, what are your rules of engagement and code of conduct. At
    Thoughtworks, we’ve allowed all our employees to open an account on our Mastodon
    server as this is aligned with our culture and our practice of being quite vocal
    and transparent about what we are passionate about. We encourage our employees
    to publish blog posts, articles and books on different topics. It was a natural
    continuation to allow them to publish short messages on the Fediverse. But you
    could also very well reserve this for a small group of official accounts, or
    create accounts associated with campaigns, events, particular products or
    departments. You can also invite some high profile clients or partners to have
    an account on your Mastodon server. It’s really up to you how you want to use
    your own social space. </p>

<p>And since Mastodon offers this possibility, you can always transfer the
    followers from one account to another. You are not stuck in one place, in one
    network, with one account. You can regroup or move your account to a different
    place. So you’ll never lose the community you’ve started building.</p>

<p>This could be especially useful if the members of your organization need to
    have a social media presence to do their work. Offering them a safe space to
    connect and build an audience can have mutual benefits. They will be
    representing your organization on the Fediverse but also benefit from the
    organization’s recognition and create a more trusted voice. This can be
    especially interesting for news organizations which generally need their
    journalists to be quickly identified on social networks and allow them to
    connect with their audience. </p>

<p>For organizations looking at amplifying their message through their members&#39;
    voice, or wanting to be more transparent and open to the exterior, offering a
    Mastodon account to your employees or volunteers is certainly a great way to
    achieve this. </p>

<p>People wanting to understand your company culture would have an authentic
    place to look at. See how your employees interact and present themselves. What
    do they talk about? Just as when people go to conferences to present a research
    or share something publicly about their work, thanks to social media, these
    interactions happen in an even more informal way, in ways that people feel
    comfortable reaching out to strangers. For us at Thoughtworks, Mastodon has
    already been a tool we’ve successfully used to attract talents, for example.</p>

<p>And if microblogging is not your jam, there are plenty of other federated
    software to serve your needs that will also interconnect with Mastodon.
    <a href="https://joinpeertube.org">Peertube</a>, is an open source alternative to
    Youtube. The Blender Foundation decided to use Peertube to publish videos on
    the Fediverse after repeatedly running into troubles with Youtube and
    getting their account temporarily blocked. For the more visual crowd, <a href="https://pixelfed.org">Pixelfed</a> is a photo sharing application very
    similar to Instagram that is also part of the Fediverse.</p>

<p>All these federated applications are open source and run on open standard
    protocols, so if some software is not really covering your needs, there is
    always a way to adapt them. At Thoughtworks, we engaged with the Mastodon
    developer community back in 2017, because we needed to make sure our employees
    could use our single sign-on provider to connect to their account on our
    instance.</p>

<p>The Fediverse is currently one of the most promising alternatives to the
    centralized social media monopolies like Facebook or Twitter. With the
    uncertainties currently faced by these mega platforms, it could be a relatively
    small but, in the long term, profitable investment to start exploring setting up
    a presence in these emerging social media spaces. The software is available and
    working. There are new avenues to explore when an organization offers a social
    media space to its members. And millions of people are currently wondering where
    to go. </p>
