      <span>Abstract:</span>  The R programming language is widely used in large-scale data analyses. It
contains especially rich built-in support for dealing with vectors, arrays, and
matrices. These operations feature prominently in the applications that form
R&#39;s raison d&#39;Ãªtre, making their behavior worth understanding. Furthermore,
ostensibly for programmer convenience, their behavior in R is a notable
extension over the corresponding operations in mathematics, thereby offering
some challenges for specification and static verification.
