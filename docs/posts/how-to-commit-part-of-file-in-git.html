    <h1>How to commit part of file in Git</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="outline-text-headline-1">
<p>Imagine you&#39;re working on a feature branch and have made several changes to a file to implement different aspects of the feature. However, some of these changes are related to the feature being developed, while others are unrelated or incomplete. For example, you may have added new functionality, refactored existing code, and made some debugging changes within the same file.</p>
<p>
In such a scenario, you may want to commit the completed and relevant changes first to keep your commits focused and meaningful. This allows you to push incremental updates to the remote repository without including unfinished or unrelated changes.</p>
<p>
By committing only part of the file, you can ensure that each commit represents a logical unit of work, making it easier to review, revert, or cherry-pick changes in the future. This practice also facilitates collaboration with other team members, as they can understand the purpose and scope of each commit more effectively.</p>
