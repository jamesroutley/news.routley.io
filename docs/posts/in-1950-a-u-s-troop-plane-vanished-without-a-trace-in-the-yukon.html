It took off in frigid cold with precious few hours of daylight left. </p><p>The crew of the Douglas C-54 Skymaster #2469 was supposed to check in every 30 minutes along the route. As the aircraft crossed into Yukon, they radioed the tiny outpost of Snag to say that there was ice forming on the wings, but otherwise, all was well.</p><p>After that, the Skymaster disappeared. And to this day no sign of the aircraft or its passengers has ever been found.</p><p><a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/skymaster-down/s01e01"><em>Skymaster Down</em></a> is a decades-old mystery that still defines the families of those 44 missing people.</p><p>The U.S. Air Force staged a huge search operation immediately after the plane was lost. Day by day, in the winter of 1950, newspapers around the world carried stories about the Skymaster, its passengers and the desperate rescue operation. The Yukon was covered with heavy snow as the temperatures plunged. U.S. and Canadian aircraft flew grid patterns all along the flight path, with spotters peering through frosted windows. It was chaotic — four of the search planes crashed.</p><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A black and white newspaper clipping shows a family gathered around a radio.

The families of the 44 people who missing with the Skymaster received death certificates. And the U.S. Air Force never returned to the Yukon to search again.</p><p>The Douglas C-54 Skymaster had four engines, a 100&#39; wingspan and a 26&#39; high tail fin. Even in the massive expanse of the Yukon wilderness, it would be hard to hide a plane that big. Is it in a lake? At the bottom of a valley? Is there a chance that it flew off course and crashed into the mountains?</p><p>There&#39;s a database of over 500 known airplane wrecks in the territory. All have been located, visited and accounted for. But the Skymaster remains stubbornly lost.</p><p><a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/media/skymaster-down/s01e01" target="_blank"><em>Skymaster Down</em></a> tells the stories of the victim&#39;s families and takes the audience north, where even today an intrepid group of Yukoners strive to give those families closure by going out and searching every summer, ever hopeful that the Skymaster will finally turn up.</p><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A woman with short brown hair and glasses sits at a table in front of files of paperwork.
