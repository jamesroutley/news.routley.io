    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>Some thoughts on meaningful tool assistance</h4>
<p>Incalculable kilocalories of motive energy, potentially at peoples’ disposal towards meaningful ends, have been squandered because (among an array of other reasons) a significant portion of the global workforce has not been provided with the most suitable tools for the work demanded of them. The necessary balance has simply been drawn from their bodies, and untold thousands of lives have been made barely bearable as a result of this poor energy-exchange ratio.</p>
<p>There are currently millions of hoe, sickle, or machete-swinging peasants around the globe who labour far harder than should be needed in order to prepare the seedbed in the fields, harvest their staple grains or cut forage for livestock. Work-hardened as they may be, they still abuse their bodies unnecessarily.</p>
<p>However, this article is written specifically with focus on <strong>the scythe</strong>, a tool with 2500 years of history, and one that in some regions of this globe continues to be used and deeply appreciated. It is a tool that does not require appreciably more non-renewable resources to produce and maintain than does a machete. Yes, it calls for more skill — on both ends of the spectrum — its production and its application. However, human capacity for learning is unlimited; fuel to power machines is not…</p>
<p>In any case, I have long been convinced that had the scythe been sensibly introduced (by competent-for-the-task people) several generations ago as a partial, niche-specific alternative to the sickle and/or machete in all the ‘developing’ regions of the world, then the existence of millions (yes, millions) of peasants would have been much easier.</p>
<p>If well-designed for the respective task (and thereby automatically efficient) hand tools comprised the ‘help packages’, the madness could at least slow down — because tools powered by the energy springing from a human body offer their users more opportunity to reflect on our relationship with Creation. As a result, perceptive people may reconsider to-them-available options, and take the less-abusive path.</p>
<p>Still, I am not suggesting that the scythe ought to replace the machete or the sickle for all their respective kinds of work. The machete is surely one of the most multitasking steel tools our civilization has invented, and its usefulness in tropical regions is notable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, whenever supplemental fodder is to be prepared (often during relatively short windows of time) for harsh winters or extended periods of drought, the EROEI (energy returned on energy invested) relationship of a machete or a sickle is not nearly as favorable.</p>
<p>There is still another issue to consider, and that is poisonous snakes and scorpions. Having now lived for so many years in a region where there are no poisonous snakes at all, I had missed this altogether. During the four or so months of frost-free season we always walk (and mow) barefoot nearly all of the time, including when mowing in the fields. We do have plenty of snakes, but they are not poisonous, and our concern has always been that we do not harm them with the blade. Usually they move back into tall grass as we approach, without us even seeing them. Occasionally (when they perhaps decide to lay low instead of run) we do nick one, but console ourselves that such wounds can heal. Even more rarely, I have cut off a snake’s head — cleanly and completely — and whenever that happens, I apologize to the snake’s spirit…</p>
<p>During the present times of relative plenty, one option is a machine, be it one operated from a seat of a tractor, or the now so widespread “weed eater”. And though I have long been puzzled by the apparent fascination with them, with this valid concern regarding snakes entering the equation, I can begin to appreciate why so many farmers in India, for instance, would be willing to strain their family resources in order to become dependent on a tool which needs continuous supply of petrol and replacement parts.</p>
<p>With the above reflections in mind, I consider it a meaningful undertaking to present the scythe into the machete and sickle using regions where the motorized alternatives to traditional tools have not yet (or not quite) done the long-term cultural and economic damage they are often known to cause.</p>
<p>Having introduced (directly or indirectly) this old tool into many new hands in the Western part of the world, but having for the most part only second-hand experience doing so in the Global South (by way of books, reports and conversations with those ‘in the field’) I am not qualified to present some broadly applicable ‘blueprint’. Even so, I wish to offer some food for thought.</p>
<p>The bottom line of my message is this:</p>
<p><strong>1. The role of workshop organizers</strong></p>
<p>By organizers I mean people who are already actively involved in some aspect of agricultural aid in the area of the scythe-introduction-to-be, who preferably speak the language to a useful degree and understand the local etiquette or taboos. These could, of course, be natives of the respective country whose ability to communicate in English is very good. I believe that in these organizers’ hands lies a significant portion of a project’s success. Please keep in mind that I am not suggesting a strictly regimented program, but rather an approach that is pre-mediated, wholesome, and with little room for blunders. Beyond that it should be creative, niche-specific and enjoyable. Lacking those characteristics, the project may already start on a shaky footing.</p>
<p>Some ideas:</p>
<p>a) The organizers ought to carefully assess the cultural/psychological and economic constraints that are likely to make the challenge of the undertaking greater than expected, or even impossible to meet. (In some cases, especially if the continuation of the efforts seems unlikely, it may be wiser to leave that particular region alone, and instead focus one’s energy on planting seeds into already more fertile soil.)</p>
<p>b) Some familiarity with the scythe, even if only theoretical (terminology used, etc.) would be helpful; a sort of ‘homework’ the organizers could spend some time on beforehand. To this end we (the ScytheConnection, ScytheWorks and ScytheConnected folks, along with a few friends) have been working on two versions of a field manual, soon to be available as a pdf. file for a free download. The text of one version is trimmed down to what we perceive is the absolute minimum of words. It is this version that should precede the teachers as a ‘pre-introduction’ of sorts, as it is easily translatable into the language of the respective regions. The local teachers-to-be can use it as helpful reference, and pass it further afield.</p>
<p>c) Scouting suitable areas for the workshop, vegetation-wise, is rather imperative. Much surprise and disappointing unpreparedness can be prevented if the nature of the terrain (and the physical properties of the plants and their density) is communicated beforehand to the teachers (who would bring along the equipment and must make decisions as to its niche-specific appropriateness without actually seeing the terrain first).</p>
<p><strong>2. The often-unperceived challenges.</strong></p>
<p>It may well be not only a different challenge, but a greater one, to pass the scythe use know-how to a seasoned machete user, than to a Western city dweller who has hardly worked with cutting tools of any sort.</p>
<p>On a purely technical level, the two most obvious ‘obstacles’ are:</p>
<p><strong>3. Qualifications of the visiting teachers</strong></p>
<p>On this topic, I wish to emphasize that whenever I refer to someone (including myself) as a ‘teacher’ I have in mind merely a more advanced student of the subject. Furthermore, any so-called ‘teacher’ can, at best, function as a sort of bridge by means of which bits of knowledge can cross metaphorical rivers so that the learning process continues.</p>
<p>It must be kept in mind that maintaining the second edge, the one with greater forage-cutting efficiency, requires correspondingly more skill and awareness in use. If the students are not ready for that level of tool use attention, mentally or otherwise, it may be somewhat counterproductive to attempt it at all. However, the most fitting compromise can be found for every set of circumstances, and that is exactly what those guiding the learning process need to be able to ascertain.</p>
<p>As a side note: Many thousands of blades presently in use in the ‘third’ world are functioning far below their potential, even though they have sometimes been used for several generations. In some cases they are too short, too long or too heavy to be as efficient as a scythe blade could be, again, in that respective locality. Often enough they are put on snaths of inferior design or size, and sloppily fine-tuned. But perhaps most importantly, adequate sharpening skills were not passed along by those who were involved with the initial introduction. Notorious lack of suitable grindstones along with the fact that the alternative — the art of shaping the edge by means of common hammers (“peening”) — was never taught, this continues to contribute to situations where the EROEI is significantly less than it ought to be. (Also addressed in Note 2.)</p>
<p>In any case, I consider learning how to peen (plus make repairs as soon as damage to the edge happens) to be rather paramount, and would hope that all teachers are in agreement.</p>
<p><strong>4. Equipment.</strong></p>
<p>Teaching students the basic principles of making snaths out of local material is, to me, another given. By local material I mean wood, not steel.</p>
<p><strong>5. Further preparatory steps</strong></p>
<p>As has been proven enough times, both in Europe and overseas, a somewhat haphazard public/village demo, followed by an open invitation to a scythe course is usually relatively unsuccessful; only a small fraction of the volunteer participants end up learning enough to make good use of the tool for even their own purposes, never mind passing on the skill (at any acceptable standard) to others.</p>
<p>Instead, I suggest that the initial students from the local population (the scythe teachers-to-be) are carefully selected well beforehand, preferably with help of the elders of that village, who are intimately familiar with the personalities of people they watched growing up. The new concept and purpose of the course has to be properly explained to them, as well as to the potential students, by someone whom the community has come to respect. (I surmise that if the elders were fundamentally opposed to the introduction, it may well be best to leave that village/region alone.) Alternatively (or in addition), local agricultural representatives — if they were not already ‘high-jacked’ in name of “progress” by machinery dealers — can often be of invaluable help. Getting in touch with them well in advance is certainly to be recommended. While presenting the case to both (the elders and the agricultural representatives) some video material, if access to a computer is available, would be highly useful.</p>
<p>Secondly, I think that women deserve to be considered for the role of local scythe teachers more than has generally been the case. Over the years of working with males or females, as well as mixed groups, I have concluded that, on average, women are better students. They seem to listen more carefully and have less of a tendency to act as a ‘show off’. What does not come as naturally to women is the sharpening, probably because in most cultures it was traditionally men’s job. But, given a little more time, most of them can learn it just the same.</p>
<p>Consequently, at least in the regions where the cultural paradigm does not object to women taking on such a role, I personally would choose a combination of 75% women and 25% men as the ideal mix for the initial groups of students. To be yet more specific, girls between the age of 10 to 15 and old(er) women of a not too strong physique would make the best local demonstration actors. In other words, a group which by mere appearance makes it obvious that to operate a well-tuned scythe does not require much strength, and can be sustained for several hours without causing undue pain or long-term damage to physiology of the body.</p>
<p>Thirdly, I’d prefer to focus attention on one small group at a time. Two competent instructors with a clearly laid out plan, and a few different blades (that together would demonstrate the basic variations of fitting and application) should be able to train 4 students fairly well in about 4 days. That includes learning how to make a single-grip snath from scratch, and a grasp of the basic snath- and blade-fitting concepts. Additional requirements would be a good interpreter, suitable terrain and undisturbed surroundings. (Bystanders watching is a disturbance, for instance.) By suitable terrain I mean one where the vegetation provides opportunities for mowing larger areas (using a longer blade) as well as ‘obstacle courses’ where the forage is interspersed with rocks and bushes. Moving to different locations as the course progresses in order to practice the variations should be considered.</p>
<p>On the 5th day, I would let the group work on their own, with one of the instructors in the proximity, watching but not intervening). The students should by that time be learning to recognize shortcomings in the performance of their comrades, respectfully voice them, and thereby begin the role of instructors. Another day of ‘touch ups’ (if the time frame allows, preferably after a few days of each student working at home on their own) should make this group ready to pass the skill along to others in their region.</p>
<p>By this approach, four such groups could be readied within a month (or three in a month, if the last week is devoted to refining details with everyone). The resulting accomplishments would thus justify the combined energy input needed for the organizing of it all, and the instructors’ travel.</p>
<p><strong>Further reflections of merit.</strong></p>
<p>Harvesting of Grains</p>
<p>Beginning ones scythe experience with the harvesting of grains is somewhat analogous to “putting the cart before the ox”. I am fundamentally not in favor of it. The addition of a grain cradle attached to the snath adds considerable complexity to the learning process. Whenever the stalks do not fall as they should, it is difficult for a novice to identify where the trouble lies. Is it the manner in which the blade is guided, or is it the cradle adjustment instead? Among the wide variety of cradle versions, the ones that can be realistically expected to be locally made do need to be adjusted differently for not only different crops but also in view of the individual conditions of respective fields. It first takes experience and then patience to get this right.</p>
<p>In areas where larger-scale grain harvesting is the eventual aim of scythe application, a demo certainly has merit, and the most talented of the students could be given special attention in this regard — but not in lieu of first learning the basics of scythe use really well. Initially the students ought to be offered an empowering experience and such could be best obtained in a field of well-standing and relatively young grass. One good day (after the preliminaries) would suffice for that, and would be time well spent.</p>
<p>In any case, I’m sure that in old Europe everyone who picked up a scythe with a cradle attached to it was already quite competent in using this tool for cutting grass — and that is what I recommend as the initial aim of every new introduction. According to some feedback I have received on this topic, in certain situations it is impractical. For instance, there may be a rice paddy to demonstrate the use of a cradle scythe on, but no grass available in the same location to practice the technique without the cradle first. Yes, obstacles abound. But without first recognizing and then surmounting them, the holy grail of ‘sustainability’ will remain just beyond the next curve in the road…</p>
<p>The Overall Project’s Timeline.</p>
<p>I think that bringing only a few scythes into a region where nearly everyone is a farmer (and thus could well use one) is analogous to a story of an Avatar manifesting only a few fish, while a thousand hungry mouths are standing in line to be fed, and telling the people that he will be back next year with more miracles…</p>
<p>It should then go without saying that I do not approve of the snail’s pace that many scythe introduction attempts consider “OK”, or even ‘inevitable’. What typically happens in these cases is that sponsors for the project are first sought, and from the donated money the initial batch of equipment is purchased — more often than not somewhere in the ‘West’ and possibly at the respective country’s retail prices, with some meager discount. Then an individual or group take along a dozen or two complete scythe units (but often less), conduct a demo and/or a short course and depart, leaving the scythes behind. The well-meant intent is that they will be back ‘next year’, after another collection plate is passed around so more scythes and plane tickets can be bought. Sometimes such plans do not materialize, but even if they do — a year is a very long pause. If more equipment is desired in the interim, it is often found either cost-prohibitive with respect to local economy, or no ready source seems available at all. Meanwhile, the few scythes left behind must be shared, which may be a nice ideological principle but hardly a practical one. (Note 3.)</p>
<p>Supply and Costs.</p>
<p>Assuming that the initial introduction shows prospects of being successful and quickly stimulates further interest within that region, a question must be asked well in advance, about whether a dependable source and distribution system of reasonably priced blades of acceptable quality will be available. Presently, this is still the case, BUT in the long run it is by no means a given. The continuation of many optimistic but insufficiently pre-meditated attempts at scythe introduction nosedived for this reason, especially, it seems, in Africa. The people involved generally sum it up in one of two ways — the African farmers just can’t afford a scythe, or it simply is not available there.</p>
<p>As for “unaffordable” — I think that given the unprecedented challenges facing these cultures (as well as us all), they can actually ill afford not to purchase and make use of scythes. The variation in affordability is certainly an issue but is usually due more to other factors than is generally assumed. The exclamation that “these people are too poor to buy a scythe” — while referring to cultures where everyone owns a sickle — can be balanced by the old Mid-Eastern maxim “I am too poor to buy cheap tools”. (‘Less well-suited’, ‘poorly designed’ or ‘inefficient’ could, of course, be substituted equally well for “cheap”.)</p>
<p>Some hard-to-dispute evidence implies that, in the long run (and where applicable), the scythe is decidedly a ‘better deal’. Here is why:</p>
<p>Now, due to numerous accounts to that effect, I am aware that in many countries scythes are not readily available. I emphasize the ‘readily’ because the distance between a scythe blade and a needy farmer’s hands is often not as great as imagined.</p>
<p>A few concrete examples:</p>
<p>Regarding Africa — Algeria presently still receives scythe blades (mostly from Europe) in lots sometimes as large as ten thousand at a time. Morocco and Egypt have also been importing them for a very long time. I realize that the distance from North Africa to the rest of the continent is very far, yet less useful merchandise is regularly moving along those routes. Of course, finding something and having it delivered is one thing, while the resulting cost (especially of very small lots and the hands in-between raking in profits) is another.</p>
<p>Regarding India — There are 3 scythe factories (all under the management of one family) within relatively close distance to India — one in Turkey, one in Kyrgyzstan and one in Iran. The price/quality ratio of what they produce may be the best, globally. Why has some Indian entrepreneur with a kind heart not grasped the oft-expressed need to put a good scythe into the hands of the thousands of laboring India’s women?? Or why have not the various small-scale agriculture oriented activists/analysts/observers brought this issue to someone’s attention; someone who can ‘move mountains’?? I have no answers to these questions, but each time I hear yet another crying voice from India, I keep re-asking them…</p>
<p>Re. Latin America — ever since that continent was mostly conquered, its gold and silver carted off to Europe, its cultures and peoples decimated, scythes have been used by some European settlers in various small niches between Northern Mexico and Tierra del Fuego. A few small scythe-making enterprises set up by European immigrants had earlier existed in Brazil (and possibly elsewhere (Argentina, Chile?). In the end, the tool-making giant – Tramontina of Brazil – was the last one on that continent to produce scythe blades. I was told by the manager that they quit the production (2 years ago) because they “could not compete, in quality, with the European imports. (please note how his qualified bird’s eye view contradicts the oft-expressed notion that common man’s tools ‘must’ be cheap, rather than well designed and well made…) Tramontina still offers scythe blades today, but those are made in Italy (actually the best on the world market).</p>
<p>To sum up: What no assistance organization appears to have done so far — assuming that one existed which grasped the merits of the scythe (and I’ve not been privileged to find one so far) — is help set up various cooperative supply ventures that would establish contacts directly with the factories, distribute a combined bulk order among a few strategic locations throughout a continent or a country, and agree to sell them to educational and/or otherwise meaningful projects at minimal mark-up above the combined costs (including transport, etc.) With such an arrangement, I believe, the scythes would not be ‘cost prohibitive’.</p></div></div>
