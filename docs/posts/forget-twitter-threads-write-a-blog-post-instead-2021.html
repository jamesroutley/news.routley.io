<p>All of the kool kids in Twitter land seem to be jumping on the bandwagon of a very annoying craze. Twitter threads. Please stop; write a blog post instead.</p>
<p>As someone who has only really started using Twitter in the last few months (as I much prefer <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@kev">Mastodon</a>) I&#39;ve noticed that some people love nothing more than a good thread.</p>
<p>I assume it&#39;s because these people seem to get a tonne of followers off the back of these threads, thus perpetuating the whole thing and forcing more people onto that bandwagon.</p>
<h2 id="h-what-is-a-twitter-thread">What is a Twitter thread?</h2>
<p>That&#39;s a fantastic question, dear reader. Basically, a Twitter thread is a collection of single Tweets that collectively make one story. It&#39;s common to have 10 or more Tweets in a single thread, but some times they get ridiculous.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1449525455988539394">this thread</a> is <strong>50 Tweets long</strong>. Fifty. Tweets. Long!</p>
<figure><img alt="A 50 tweet Twitter thread!" loading="lazy" src="https://kevquirk.com/media/pages/blog/forget-twitter-threads-write-a-blog-post-instead/239c3d6ace-1723205404/50-tweet-thread-example.png"/></figure>
<h2 id="h-what-s-my-problem-with-threads">What&#39;s my problem with threads?</h2>
<p>Anyone who regularly reads my content will know <a href="https://kevquirk.com/my-history-with-blogging/">I&#39;ve been blogging for a long time</a>, so I&#39;m always going to be bias. But the issue I really have with these blasted threads boils down to one thing. <strong>Context.</strong></p>
<p>Using the example above, I became aware of it because someone that I follow re-tweeted Tweet number 47 in this ridiculously long thread. Because it was a random Tweet in a very long thread, I (and I imagine most other people reading the tweet) had absolutely no context as to what the whole saga was about.</p>
<h3 id="h-it-isn-t-the-right-platform">It isn&#39;t the right platform</h3>
<p>Secondly, Twitter isn&#39;t the right platform for long-form content. If it was, it wouldn&#39;t have a 280 character limit. It&#39;s a micro blogging platform; and as we all know, <em>micro</em> means small.</p>
<p>Surely a much better way of sharing long-form content would be to write a single coherent piece on a blog, then post a link to it on Twitter so your followers can read it in its entirety.</p>
<p>This also has the added benefit of decentralising content away from platforms like Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Kev, not everyone knows how to setup a blog!</p>
<p><cite>Non-bloggers everywhere</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I get it, most people don&#39;t have a blog, but <a href="https://kevquirk.com/how-to-start-a-blog-if-youre-not-a-nerd/">it&#39;s super simple</a> to start your one, or use a hosted provider, like <a href="https://wordpress.com">WordPress</a>. So there&#39;s no excuse really.</p>
<p>I know some people on Twitter who post threads regularly. Why can&#39;t these long-form threads become posts on a blog? It would be easier for people to consume, they can still post it on Twitter, and it has the added benefit of potentially creating a whole new audience for the creator.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen some really interesting threads on Twitter that are full of useful information, but as a consumer of that content, it&#39;s a nightmare to follow. Content creators should make content as simple to consume as possible.</p>
<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m just a dinosaur that needs to get with the times. If that&#39;s the case, I&#39;ll continue to die on this hill. I&#39;d much rather own my content, and provide a coherent, easy to consume experience for my readers. Rather than trying to shoehorn a platform into submission just because it&#39;s the cool thing to do, or because it&#39;s the content creator&#39;s preferred platform.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve tried posting a couple of Twitter threads myself, but both times I did it I found it awkward and confusing. Honestly, I don&#39;t get why people do it. For the likes? For the shares?</p>
