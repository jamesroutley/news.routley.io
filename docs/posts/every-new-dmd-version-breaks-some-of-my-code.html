    <h1>Every new DMD version breaks some of my code</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I usually try to stay more silent (on the form at least), but I think I reached my boiling point. I&#39;ve been a (self employed) full time D developer for almost 2 years now, developing quite a large codebase of personal closed source projects, as well as adopting some 3rdparty code like dlangui. And my life has become particularly miserable in the last half a year or so.</p>
<p>I wish I was exaggerating, but <strong>every</strong> new DMD version breaks some of my code, to a smaller or bigger extent. It can be either my own code, or dependency code, but I started drowning in deprecation messages or outright breakage. It&#39;s nearly impossible to develop any reasonable 3rdparty in those conditions. I&#39;m tired of fixing things that weren&#39;t broken. And I can&#39;t even imagine having to support multiple branches of code because of those deprecations. But I probably should, as, periodically, I get issues that dlangui can&#39;t compile with some outdated dmd version. It&#39;s just insane!</p>
<p>Recently, some of the changes resulted in direct API changes. This is unacceptable, as it, basically, forces people to update major versions and split the codebase between &#34;before&#34; and &#34;after&#34;. Also forcing them to support two version of the same thing.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of talk about Gripes, about the &#34;Vision&#34; of D... But more than half a year passed, and yet the breakage only gets worse, and nothing seems to be improving. At least in regards of LTS. And with no proper LTS, no proper 3rd-party can exist.</p>
<p>So, as pissed as I am, please, for the love of everything, stop breaking D. I understand the desire to improve the language, but can you understand the desire to just... write working code? Please, make D at least somewhat stable.</p>
