<hr/>

<p>
	<b>Tramway SDK</b> (heavy metal spelling –
	T̈ra̦m̊ẅa̦ÿ SD̈K) is a graphics
	package/framework/game engine that I have been working on for the past
	3 years.
</p>

<p>
	In this article I attempt to turn you against mainstream engines and I will
	explain, in detail, why Tramway SDK is not as awful as them.
</p>

<h2>
	Unreasonable system requirements due to Turbobloat
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Unity needs very powerful hardware and consumes enough power to burn down a
	rainforest. Godot is slightly better, but you still need relatively capable
	hardware.
</p>

<p>
	But what if all that you really want to make is just a lowpoly horror
	roguelite deckbuilder simulator? 15 year old hardware is more than capable
	of running a game like that, but not if you use a mainstream engine, due to
	Turbobloat.
</p>

<p>
	Tramway SDK can run on virtually any hardware from the last 15 years, since
	it is not Turbobloated. It doesn&#39;t even need a graphics card, since it can
	be switched to use software rasterization, making it perfect for displaying
	graphics on	toasters and fridges.
</p>

<p>
	Some might say &#34;just get a better computer&#34;. This is why getting a better
	computer is bad:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<h4>
			Affordance
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			A lot of people, especially from 3rd world countries are very poor
			and can&#39;t afford to buy hardware to run Turbobloat.
		</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4>
			e-Waste
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			Producing computer chips is very bad on the environment. If modern
			software wasn&#39;t Turbobloated you would buy new hardware only when
			the previous hardware broke and wasn&#39;t repairable.
		</p>
	</li>
	
	<li>
		<h4>
			Not putting up with Turbobloat
		</h4>
		
		<p>
			Why spend money on another computer if you already have one that
			works perfectly fine? Just because of someone else&#39;s turbobloat? 
			You could buy 1000 cans of Dr. Pepper instead.
		</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>
	Nodes are bad
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	A thing should be a thing. It should not be a bunch of things pretending to
	be a single thing. With nodes you have to pretend that a collection of
	things is a single thing.
</p>

<p>
	Also when creating things with nodes, you have to go back and forth between
	node GUI and code. 
</p>

<p>
	In Tramway SDK you just subclass the Entity class and write the code. After
	that you make a level using the level editor. No going back and forth. No 
	nodes, just entities.
</p>

<h2>
	Monolithism
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	All of the mainstream engines have a monolithic game editor. It doesn&#39;t
	matter how many features you use from it, you still have to wait 10 minutes
	for all of them to load in.
</p>

<p>
	Tramway SDK has editors, but all of them are optional. If you just want to
	use it as a framework, you can use only the C++ runtime. If you want to
	build levels, you can use only the level editor and no other GUI tool.
</p>

<p>
	Data files are stored as whitespace-seperated-values, so you could even edit
	all of the data files by hand, without using a single editor.
</p>

<h2>
	Bad graphics
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Most Unity games look like very bad, even with fancy shaders, normal mapping
	and other techniques.
</p>

<p>
	Look at what Tramway SDK can do with just lightmapping and Gouraud shading:

	</a></center>

<h2>
	Quake level editors
</h2>

<hr/>

<p>
	Brush based level geometry is very good and you can prototype levels with it
	very quickly. Tramway SDK has a <code>.map</code> file converter, which
	converts brushes into triangle meshes.
