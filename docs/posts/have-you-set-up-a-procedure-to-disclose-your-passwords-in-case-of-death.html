    <h1>Ask HN: Have you set up a procedure to disclose your passwords in case of death?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>After coming back from my home country where the insecurity is a big part of the daily life (armed robbery, kidnapping, murder), I started thinking of what would happen if something happened to me and how would I be able to ease the burden on my love ones to manage my digital assets (cancel subscriptions, keep my digital libraries, etc). So I ask: do you have a procedure in place to grant or transfer access in case of death?</p><p>My first idea would be using a password manager for everything, list every device used for 2SA and confine within my will a master password.</p></div></div></div>
