                                    Fallinorg uses Sentence Transformers AI to understand your file content locally on your Mac. It then classifies, suggests and sorts files into meaningful folders based on their content.

                                    Absolutely. All processing happens on your device. Your files never leave your Mac, and no data is sent to any external servers.
                                </p>
