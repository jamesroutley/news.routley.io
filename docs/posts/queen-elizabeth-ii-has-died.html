Elizabeth and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, spent much of wartime at Windsor Castle after their parents rejected suggestions they be evacuated to Canada.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After turning 18, Elizabeth spent five months with the Auxiliary Territorial Service and learned basic motor mechanic and driving skills. &#34;I began to understand the esprit de corps that flourishes in the face of adversity,&#34; she recalled later.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Through the war, she exchanged letters with her third cousin, Philip, Prince of Greece, who was serving in the Royal Navy. Their romance blossomed and the couple married at Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947, with the prince taking the title of Duke of Edinburgh. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She would later describe him as &#34;my strength and stay&#34; through 74 years of marriage, before his death in 2021, aged 99.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span> Tim Graham/PA</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The Duke of Edinburgh was at the Queen&#39;s side for more than six decades of reign, becoming the longest-serving consort in British history in 2009</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Their first son, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by Princess Anne, in 1950, Prince Andrew, in 1960, and Prince Edward, in 1964. Between them, they gave their parents eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya in 1952, representing the ailing King, when Philip broke the news that her father had died. She immediately returned to London as the new Queen.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can,&#34; she later recalled.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Elizabeth was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953, aged 27, in front of a then-record TV audience estimated at more than 20 million people. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Subsequent decades would see great change, with the end of the British Empire overseas and the swinging &#39;60s sweeping away social norms at home.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Elizabeth reformed the monarchy for this less deferential age, engaging with the public through walkabouts, royal visits and attendance at public events. Her commitment to the Commonwealth was a constant - she visited every Commonwealth country at least once.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But there were periods of private and public pain. In 1992, the Queen&#39;s &#34;annus horribilis&#34;, fire devastated Windsor Castle - a private residence as well as working palace - and three of her children&#39;s marriages broke down.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in 1997, the Queen drew criticism for appearing reluctant to respond publicly.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There were questions about the monarchy&#39;s relevance in modern society. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;No institution… should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don&#39;t,&#34; she acknowledged.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>PA</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor was born in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926, the first child of the Duke and Duchess of York</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As a 21-year-old princess, Elizabeth had vowed to devote her life to service. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Reflecting on those words decades later, during her Silver Jubilee in 1977, she declared: &#34;Although that vow was made in my salad days, when I was green in judgment, I do not regret nor retract one word of it.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>That same commitment to serving was made 45 years later in a thank you letter to the nation on the weekend of her Platinum Jubilee in June.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The milestone was celebrated with a mix of state ceremonies and a colourful festival of all things British, as well as lively street parties.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Although the Queen&#39;s health kept her from some events, she said: &#34;My heart has been with you all.&#34;</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div></main></div></div></div>
