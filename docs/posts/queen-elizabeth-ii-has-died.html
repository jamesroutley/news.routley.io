I know her loss will be deeply felt throughout the country, the Realms and the Commonwealth, and by countless people around the world.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He said during the period of mourning and change he and his family would be &#34;comforted and sustained by our knowledge of the respect and deep affection in which The Queen was so widely held&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In a statement, Buckingham Palace said: &#34;The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The King and the Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to London tomorrow.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>All the Queen&#39;s children travelled to Balmoral, near Aberdeen, after doctors placed the Queen under medical supervision.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Her grandson, Prince William, is also there, with his brother, Prince Harry, on his way.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prime Minister Liz Truss, who was appointed by the Queen on Tuesday, said the monarch &#34;provided us with the stability and strength that we needed&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She said His Majesty would be known as King Charles III.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Queen Elizabeth II&#39;s tenure as head of state spanned post-war austerity, the transition from empire to Commonwealth, the end of the Cold War and the UK&#39;s entry into - and withdrawal from - the European Union.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Her reign spanned 15 prime ministers starting with Winston Churchill, born in 1874, and including Ms Truss, born 101 years later in 1975.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She held weekly audiences with her prime minister throughout her reign.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At Buckingham Palace in London, crowds awaiting updates on the Queen&#39;s condition began crying as they heard of her death. The Union flag on top of the palace was lowered to half-mast at 18:30 BST.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Queen was born Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor, in Mayfair, London, on 21 April 1926.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Few could have foreseen she would become monarch but in December 1936 her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated from the throne to marry the twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Elizabeth&#39;s father became King George VI and, at age 10, Lilibet, as she was known in the family, became heir to the throne.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Within three years, Britain was at war with Nazi Germany. Elizabeth and her younger sister, Princess Margaret, spent much of wartime at Windsor Castle after their parents rejected suggestions they be evacuated to Canada.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After turning 18, Elizabeth spent five months with the Auxiliary Territorial Service and learned basic motor mechanic and driving skills. &#34;I began to understand the esprit de corps that flourishes in the face of adversity,&#34; she recalled later.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Through the war, she exchanged letters with her third cousin, Philip, Prince of Greece, who was serving in the Royal Navy. Their romance blossomed and the couple married at Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947, with the prince taking the title of Duke of Edinburgh. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She would later describe him as &#34;my strength and stay&#34; through 74 years of marriage, before his death in 2021, aged 99.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span> Tim Graham/PA</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The Duke of Edinburgh was at the Queen&#39;s side for more than six decades of reign, becoming the longest-serving consort in British history in 2009</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Their first son, Charles, was born in 1948, followed by Princess Anne, in 1950, Prince Andrew, in 1960, and Prince Edward, in 1964. Between them, they gave their parents eight grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Princess Elizabeth was in Kenya in 1952, representing the ailing King, when Philip broke the news that her father had died. She immediately returned to London as the new Queen.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It was all a very sudden kind of taking on and making the best job you can,&#34; she later recalled.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Elizabeth was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 2 June 1953, aged 27, in front of a then-record TV audience estimated at more than 20 million people. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Subsequent decades would see great change, with the end of the British Empire overseas and the swinging &#39;60s sweeping away social norms at home.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Elizabeth reformed the monarchy for this less deferential age, engaging with the public through walkabouts, royal visits and attendance at public events. Her commitment to the Commonwealth was a constant - she visited every Commonwealth country at least once.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But there were periods of private and public pain. In 1992, the Queen&#39;s &#34;annus horribilis&#34;, fire devastated Windsor Castle - a private residence as well as working palace - and three of her children&#39;s marriages broke down.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in a car accident in Paris in 1997, the Queen drew criticism for appearing reluctant to respond publicly.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There were questions about the monarchy&#39;s relevance in modern society. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;No institutionâ€¦ should expect to be free from the scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support, not to mention those who don&#39;t,&#34; she acknowledged.</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div></main></div></div></div>
