    <h1>Echo â€“ Open Hardware Music Player</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">Echo is an open hardware platform for music players. The goal of
the project is to produce a high quality music player, based on
and designed with free software. It&#39;s primarily designed to run
<a href="https://www.rockbox.org" rel="nofollow">Rockbox</a>, a free music player firmware
with support for many codecs, and a wide array of features.</p>
<p dir="auto">KiCAD 8.0 was used for the electrical design and PCB layout.
The planned 3D-printable case will be designed using FreeCAD.
The designs themselves are available under the CERN-OHL-S v2
license.</p>
<p dir="auto">The current version of the Echo player is called the Echo R1.
In the future, there could be new player models if there are
significant changes to the features or form factor, but old
models will always be supported.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/amachronic/echoplayer/blob/main/images/echo-r1.png"><img src="https://github.com/amachronic/echoplayer/raw/main/images/echo-r1.png" alt="3D render of Echo R1 case"/></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Size: 60x100x15mm (approx)</li>
<li>Weight: TBD</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The R1 has a 4-way D-pad and 6 multi-function buttons on the
faceplate, which can be used to quickly navigate your music
library and control playback. There are dedicated volume and
power buttons (not pictured), and a sliding hold switch near
the power button, which locks the buttons against accidental
presses when the player is in your pocket or bag.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are two 3.5mm jacks, one for headphones, and one true
line-out port. The headphone jack supports recording from an
in-line microphone and playback control by an in-line remote.
Both jacks can be used simultaneously.</p>
<p dir="auto">The removable memory card slot allows up to 2 TiB of storage
for your music and files. The USB-C port is used for charging
and file transfer, and supports high-speed USB 2.0.</p>
<p dir="auto">The battery socket accepts the widely available BL-5C battery,
and the battery can easily be replaced without special tools
when it starts to wear out.</p>

<p dir="auto">The Rev1 prototype PCB is complete but has some problems (see the
list of known issues below). A 3D-printable case for the Rev1 is
planned, but CAD files aren&#39;t available yet.</p>
<p dir="auto">Development is currently focused on two areas:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Porting Rockbox to the Rev1 board to identify any issues with
the hardware design.</li>
<li>Designing a case to test general usability and ergonomics, and
find issues with the mechanical design of the PCB.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The next revision will be focused on addressing issues from Rev1.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>The backlight cannot be disabled, power is supplied to the LEDs
even when the boost converter is disabled.</li>
<li>The current limit on the backlight LED driver is set too low
(20 mA paralleled to 4 LEDs, should be 20 mA per LED).</li>
<li>Reference designators in the schematics don&#39;t make much sense,
there are gaps in the numbering and samed-valued components are
not in contiguous ranges.</li>
</ul>
