Its reputation for excellence in chemistry, physics, biology, medicine and mathematics was rivaled, if at all, only by Britan (Medawar &amp; Pyke, 2000). Of the 100 Nobel Prizes awarded between the years of 1901 and 1932 (the year before Hitler came to power), 33 had been awarded to Germans and/or scientists working in Germany. For comparison, Brits and scientists in British universities had won 18 and the United States a mere six.</p><p><span>Then, starting in 1933 with the Nazi party’s seizure of control in Germany and their passing of the </span><em>Berufsbeamtengesetz</em><span> (“Law for the Restoration of the Professsional Civil Service”), certain groups of public employees were dimissed from German universities. That is, civil servants who did not fit the Nazi racial or societal ideal had to leave their jobs in the name of </span><em>“re-establishing a national and professional civil service”. </em><span>In addition to bureaucrats, teachers, judges and other workers, scientists and academics were almost immediately affected, including at the world-leading institutions of the University of Göttingen and Humboldt University of Berlin (Heims, 1980 p. 165). By the middle of April, the Main Office for Press and Propaganda of the German Student Union proclaimed a nationwide “</span><em>action against the un-German spirit</em><span>”. Not long after, public Nazi marches on and around university campuses were taking place and “</span><em>bücherverbrennung”</em><span> (book-burning ceremonies) were held in protest of literature found to be sympathetic with socio-democratic, left-leaning and/or “Jewish values”. In a series of letters to a colleague in America, </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/von-neumann" rel="">John von Neumann</a><span> (1903-57) (who had emigrated to the U.S. in 1930) wrote (Rédei, 2005):</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“The news from Germany are bad: heaven knows what the summer term 1933 will look like.”</em></p></blockquote><p>The term, indeed the coming years, became what has been later called  a “great purge” of world-renowned scientists from Germany, the likes of which the world had never seen. The effect? The rise of the United States as the world’s center of scientifist research and the “death” of the University of Göttingen as a top tier research university (see essay below).</p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><div><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/the-mathematical-center-of-the-universe-28f" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13ba981e-f0e1-4ca4-93f6-840dd7095102_1434x596.png"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F13ba981e-f0e1-4ca4-93f6-840dd7095102_1434x596.png" sizes="100vw" alt="The Mathematical Center of the Universe" width="140" height="140"/></picture></div></a></div></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07ad0e29-1a39-4c71-8452-9595dd053fff_966x606.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07ad0e29-1a39-4c71-8452-9595dd053fff_966x606.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07ad0e29-1a39-4c71-8452-9595dd053fff_966x606.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07ad0e29-1a39-4c71-8452-9595dd053fff_966x606.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07ad0e29-1a39-4c71-8452-9595dd053fff_966x606.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07ad0e29-1a39-4c71-8452-9595dd053fff_966x606.png" width="966" height="606" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/07ad0e29-1a39-4c71-8452-9595dd053fff_966x606.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:606,&#34;width&#34;:966,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07ad0e29-1a39-4c71-8452-9595dd053fff_966x606.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07ad0e29-1a39-4c71-8452-9595dd053fff_966x606.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07ad0e29-1a39-4c71-8452-9595dd053fff_966x606.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07ad0e29-1a39-4c71-8452-9595dd053fff_966x606.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a><figcaption>Nazi leader Adolf Hitler bows to President of Germany Paul von Hindenburg on March 21st, 1933</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>On January 30th 1933, the President of Germany Paul von Hindenburg reluctantly appointed Nazi party leader Adolf Hitler to be the Chancellor of Germany. After two months in office, following the burning of the Reichstag building, the German parliament passed what has later been called the “Enabling Act” giving Hitler </span><em>full legislative power </em><span>for a period of four years. Following the death of von Hindenburg the year after, Hitler exploited the act to merge the offices of Chancellor and President, creating the new office of </span><em>“Führer and Reichskanzler”</em><span>. von Neumann, then in Budapest, wrote the following of these events in a letter to his colleague Veblen in Princeton in April of 1933:</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Excerpt, letter from von Neumann to Veblen (April 3rd 1933)</strong></p><p><em>It seems, that this Summer will be a endless series of sensations - and not always of the agreeable kind. [...] Please excuse in me that I am asking such a lot of questions. But you know, how these things interest me, and how little newspapers a[re] worth, if you want to find out anything.</em></p><p><em>[...]</em></p><p><em>The news from Germany are bad: heaven knows what the summer term 1933 will look like. The next programm-number of Hitler will probably be annihilation of the conservative-monarchistic-party [...] I did not hear anything about changes or expulsions in Berlin, but it seems that the &#34;purification&#34; of universities has only reached till now Frankfurt, Göttingen, Marburg, Jena, Halle, Kiel, Köningsberg- and the other 20 will certainly follow. [...] It is really a shame, that something like that could happen in the 20th century.</em></p></blockquote><p><span>More than 250 Jewish professors and employees were fired from the University of Berlin in 1933–34 and numerous doctorates were withdrawn. In May, some 20,000 books written by “degenerates” and opponents of the Nazi regime were removed from the university library and burned in the </span><em>Babelplatz </em><span>. Reportedly, Nazi minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels gave a speech for the occasion, proclaiming the death of </span><em>“Jewish intellectualism”</em><span> (Isaacson, 2007).</span></p><p><span>Among the most prominent Jewish scholars forced to emigrate was, as von Neumann writes in his letter to Veblen, mathematician Richard Courant (1888–1972), one of Göttingen’s three institute heads. He left Germany for Cambridge in 1933, as he was dismissed from his position, not for being Jewish (exempted a veteran of the First World War), but due to his membership in the social-democratic political left (Schappacher, 1991). A former student of </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/hilbert" rel="">David Hilbert</a><span> (1862-1943), Courant first accepted a position in Cambridge, but grew homesick within a year and returned to Germany, only to realize that there was no way for him to stay permanently. He thus re-emigrated, this time to New York University where he would remain for the rest of his life, building up a large and flourishing mathematics department (Medawar &amp; Pyke, 2000) there. Other students of Hilbert at Göttingen, including Felix Bernstein (1878–1956) and Edmund Landau (1877–1938) were also forced out, as was Hilbert’s student </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/weyl" rel="">Hermann Weyl</a><span> (1885–1955), three years after being appointed his successor. Initially having been offered von Neumann’s position at the Institute for Advanced Study, Weyl changed his mind as the political situation in Germany grew worse (Weyl was a Christian, but his wife Helene was Jewish), and joined the IAS in September of 1933 (see essay below).</span></p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><div><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/the-birth-of-the-institute-for-advanced" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54c4c20f-9966-45e4-84e0-572f67cc553f_1700x820.png"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F54c4c20f-9966-45e4-84e0-572f67cc553f_1700x820.png" sizes="100vw" alt="The Birth of the Institute for Advanced Study (1930)" width="140" height="140"/></picture></div></a></div></div><p><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/einstein" rel="">Albert Einstein</a><span> (1879–1955) who openly opposed the Nazi regime, happened to be visiting the United States when Hitler came to power. A visiting professor at the California Institute of Technology on and off starting in December 1930, Einstein and his wife Elsa last left Germany for in December 1932, prior to Hitler’s ascension (see essay below). Despite holding a chair as Professor of Physics at the University of Berlin, he feared for the safety of both himself and his family. That year, a German magazine printed a list of “enemies of the German regime” with an accompanying picture of Einstein marked “not yet hanged” with a $5,000 bounty (Jerome &amp; Taylor, 2006). </span></p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><div><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/einsteins-emigration-to-america-1932" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35c6b4b6-0051-4180-a3c6-464ea4c8a072_906x698.jpeg"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F35c6b4b6-0051-4180-a3c6-464ea4c8a072_906x698.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="Einstein&#39;s Emigration to America (1932)" width="140" height="140"/></picture></div></a></div></div><p><span>When they closed up their summer house in Caputh in 1932, Einstein reportedly turned to his wife Elsa and said </span><em>“Dreh dich um. Du siehst’s nie wieder” </em><span>(Pais, 1982).</span></p><blockquote><p><em>“Turn around. You will never see it again”</em></p></blockquote><p><span>Einstein would go on to spend a period of time in the UK, before settling for good at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton alongside von Neumann and Weyl as one of the IAS’ six founding faculty members. Albeit from afar, he would play an instrumental role in the rescue operations that would take place throughout the 1930s. Writing to Professor </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/Born" rel="">Max Born</a><span> (1882-1970) in Göttingen at the end of May, his mixed emotions of enthusiasm and desperation for the mission afoot are apparent:</span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Letter from Einstein to Born (30th of May, 1933)</strong></p><p><em>Dear Born. Ehrenfest sent me your letter. I am glad that you have resigned your positions (you and Franck). Thank God there is no risk involved for either of you. But my heart aches at the thought of the young ones. Lindemann has gone to Göttingen and Berlin (for one week). Maybe you could write to him here about Teller. I heard that the establishment of a good Institute of Physics in Palestine (Jerusalem) is at present being considered.</em></p><p><em>[...]</em></p><p><em>Two years ago I tried to appeal to Rockefeller&#39;s conscience about the absurd method of allocating grants, unfortunately without success. Bohr has now gone to see him, in an attempt to persuade him to take some action on behalf of the exiled German scientists. It is to be hoped that he&#39;ll achieve something. Lindemann has considered London and Heitler for Oxford. He has set up an organization of his own for this purpose, taking in all the English universities. I am firmly convinced that all those who have made a name already will be taken care of. But the others, the young ones, will not have the chance to develop.</em></p></blockquote><p>The “Lindemann” Einstein mentions in the letter is Frederic Lindemann (1886–1957), the most influential scientific advisor to the then-”MP in opposition for Woodford” Winston Churchill. Despite his German name, Lindemann was English and a physicist by training, and so got along with both Churchill, Einstein and their colleagues in government and academia, respectively. Looking to appeal to both his sense of humanity and military strategy, Einstein went to Churchill in the summer of 1933 asking for help in bringing Jewish scientists out of Germany (see essay below).</p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><div><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/when-einstein-met-churchill-1933" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45eb2334-cdf8-4458-ba9f-8ec404be1c07_651x466.jpeg"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45eb2334-cdf8-4458-ba9f-8ec404be1c07_651x466.jpeg" sizes="100vw" alt="When Einstein met Churchill (1933)" width="140" height="140"/></picture></div></a></div></div><p>Of the meeting — which was held at Chartwell — characteristic of both men’s reputations for eccentricity, someone later wrote:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Churchill wore a large Stetson hat and Einstein a white linen suit that looked like he had slept in it”</em></p></blockquote><p>Known for his decisiveness, Churchill responded immediately by sending his friend Lindemann to Germany on a rescue mission to seek out and recruit Jewish scientists and offer them placements in British universities (Gilbert, 2007).

There he stayed for two years before returning to Princeton in 1938 to commence work on the Manhattan Project. </span></p><p><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/szilard" rel="">Leo Szilard</a><span> (1898–1964) who is best known as the discoverer of the nuclear chain reaction, similarly as Teller left Germany for England in 1933 (see essay below). Reportedly, he transferred his savings of £1,595 (about £100,000) from Zurich to London and was able to live in hotels without work for the first year. He eventually took up work as a physicist in St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, working on radioactive isotopes for medical purposes. He travelled to U.S. as a visiting researcher in 1938–39, eventually settling at Columbia University. There, in collaboration with Walter Zinn (1906-2000), he took up the task of experimentally verifying the news (brought to America by Bohr in January 1939) that Otto Hahn (1879-1968) and Fritz Strassmann (1902-80) in Germany had observed barium in the residue after bombarding uranium with neutrons, demonstrating the previously unknown phenomenon of nuclear fission. Szilard and Zinn’s initial test that the fission of uranium produced more neutrons than it consumed helped Szilard later convince Fermi and Herbert L. Anderson (1914-88) to conduct large-scale fission experiments on uranium to verify the possibility of a sustainable nuclear chain reaction. </span></p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><div><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/the-einstein-szilard-letter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b57d1fa-b1d1-4dc8-a444-fcdec4d011ee_2240x857.png"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b57d1fa-b1d1-4dc8-a444-fcdec4d011ee_2240x857.png" sizes="100vw" alt="The Einstein-Szilárd Letter (1939)" width="140" height="140"/></picture></div></a></div></div><p><span>Although himself Italian and Roman Catholic by origin, Fermi was (like his German colleagues) forced to escape Mussolini’s fascist Italy in 1938 because his wife Laura was Jewish. The creator of the world’s first nuclear reactor, Fermi won the 1938 Nobel Prize in physics for his work on induced radioactivity. Before the war, he had spent a semester studying under Born at the University of Göttingen. There, in the middle of the 1920s he first met the “father of quantum mechanics” </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/heisenberg" rel="">Werner Heisenberg</a><span> (1901-76) and his collaborator Wolfgang Pauli (1900-58). After this and several other research visits, Fermi eventually settled at the Sapienza University of Rome after obtaining a full professorship there in 1926. A Nobel laureate, upon his emigration to America in 1939, Fermi was offered positions at five different universities, eventually settling on an offer from Columbia , where he had given summer lectures in 1936. There, he conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States and with the help and encouragement of Szilárd, the first large-scale fission experiment using 200 kilograms of uranium oxide.</span></p><p>John von Neumann, alongside Wigner, was first recruited from Europe by Veblen to Princeton University in 1930. Him and Wigner had by that point collaborated on five papers and before that, attended the same Lutheran high school in Budapest in the 1910s. According to Wigner, they were invited to Princeton together on a recommendation from the university that they find and invite:</p><blockquote><p><em>&#34;..not a single person but at least two, who already knew each other, who wouldn&#39;t suddenly feel put on an island where they had no intimate contact with anybody. Johnny&#39;s name was of course well known by that time the world over, so they decided to invite Johnny von Neumann. They looked: who wrote articles with John von Neumann? They found: Mr. Wigner. So they sent a telegram to me also.&#34;</em></p><p><span>— Excerpt, </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/John-Von-Neumann-Norman-Macrae/dp/0679413081?crid=14TSD8VV8FCJA&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.ILTKEzt-734Q4vpfaXER2kyKYoxn3vxcumshsZwzOAbGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.rmKl1oLjEiD54f0lAZFNssdEI9aygPUoe2bbCoAmeGk&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=macrae+von+neumann&amp;qid=1713164823&amp;sprefix=macrae+von+neuman%2Caps%2C170&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=cantorsparadi-20&amp;linkId=bd967db1e83c55f751949159a5de8365&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="">John von Neumann</a></em><span>* by Norman Macrae (1992)</span></p></blockquote><p><span>von Neumann’s considerable research output taken into account, despite being 30 years old, he was offered a lifetime professorship at the newly-founded Institute for Advanced Study alongside Einstein and Weyl in 1933. He would later be instrumental in helping </span><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/t/godel" rel="">Kurt Gödel</a><span> (1906-78) escape occupied Austria. Although not Jewish, Gödel’s association with the Vienna Circle and his doctoral advisor Hans Hahn (1879–1934) had made him a target. In a letter to the founder of the IAS Abraham Flexner (1866–1959), von Neumann in September 1939 pleaded (Rédei, 2005):</span></p><blockquote><p><em>&#34;The claim may be made with perfect justification that Gödel is unreplaceable for our education program. Indeed Gödel is absolutely irreplaceable; he is the only mathematician alive about whom I would dare to make this statement [...] I am convinced that salvaging him from the wreck of Europe is one of the great single contributions anyone could make to science at this moment.&#34;</em></p></blockquote><p>Gödel was be offered a position at the IAS, which he assumed in 1940.</p><p>Einstein’s friend Max Planck (1858–1947) was 74 years old when the Nazis came to power. Although his friends and colleagues fled, himself, a Lutheran, tried to “persevere and continue working”, hoping the crisis would abate and the political situation improve. Later founder and President of the Max Planck Society Otto Hahn (1879–1968), despite supposed Jewish ancestry (Riehl &amp; Seitz, 1996), too remained in Germany during the rise of the Nazis, discovering nuclear fission in 1938 and being awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1944. An opponent of national socialism, Einstein later wrote of Hahn that</p><blockquote><p><em>“Hahn was one of the very few who stood upright and did the best he could in these years of evil”</em><span> — Albert Einstein</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Indeed, the only known case of a </span><em>German</em><span> scientist refusing on moral grounds to succeed an expelled Jewish colleague was Otto Krayer (1899–1982), who in response to a job offering at the University of Düsseldorf wrote the following in protest of the purge of his colleagues (Medawar &amp; Pyke, 2000):</span></p><blockquote><p><em>I prefer to forgo this appointment, though it is suited to my inclination and capabilities, rather than having to betray my convictions, or that by remaining silent I would encourage an opinion about me that does not correspond with the facts.</em><span> </span></p><p>— Otto Krayer, Assistant Professor of Pharmacology in Berlin</p></blockquote><p>In response, Krayer was dismissed from his post at the University of Berlin for refusing to accept the appointment. Wolfgang Haubner later reported about a meeting with Krayer in his diary on July 4th 1935, writing:</p><blockquote><p><em>“On the way I spoke with Krayer who justified his refusal to return to Germany with the impossibility of taking the Hitler oath”.</em></p></blockquote><p>Two years later, in 1937, Krayer was appointed as an Associate Professor at Harvard University. He lead Harvard’s Department of Pharmacology from 1939 to 1966, being awarded numerous academic honors. The news of his actions in 1933 became public in an article written by the son of Krayer’s doctoral advisor Paul Trendelenburg (1884–1931), who closed his essay with the following words:</p><blockquote><p><em>“Considering the horrors of the Third Reich, his deeds should be a comfort to us. When looking for a role model for the young generation, it is found in Otto Krayer. May the memory of this one righteous person never fade.”</em><span> </span></p><p>— Ullrich Trendelenburg</p></blockquote><p><span>Those interested in reading more about the purge of scientists from Nazi Germany, although flawed, are encouraged to obtain the book </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hitlers-Gift-Scientists-Expelled-Regime/dp/1611457092?_encoding=UTF8&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.urd0RGSr8Vr44HY4pJWFMnF84YF8kQnvdMIgtCmHPFm3y6M0e1FziHqOOvkN1b-tMxxwNytHMrtjrzucYXDsYf1tZv1Qj8SFc4rFpw2_OtMx1fVDTFPpZyb_EIhMlvoOJYXiTO7A5nU2y9wR8rkGF7hvey9yNhJU_XuOgQABLie4bGuOV5qUlcpUVHG-j8xxUYxTybNZMzG9ouqbpc3gUV8y0kAYcJwj2wwpQBLA2Vw.eIz6AAG1Ruz_YhD9ZMoxHW-ewgjkJfp7EzWbn5v0crU&amp;qid=1713165476&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=cantorsparadi-20&amp;linkId=2cb96de84db2d012c3801e7318d96b10&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="">Hitler’s Gift</a></em><span>* by Medawar and Pyke (2000).</span></p><p>Have a good week, </p><p>Jørgen.</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/the-mathematical-center-of-the-universe-28f" rel="">The Mathematical Center of the Universe</a><span>, August 8th 2021</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/the-birth-of-the-institute-for-advanced" rel="">The Birth of the Institute for Advanced Study (1930)</a><span>, August 6th 2022</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/einsteins-emigration-to-america-1932" rel="">Einstein’s Emigration to America (1932)</a><span>, January 6th 2022</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/when-einstein-met-churchill-1933" rel="">When Einstein met Churchill (1933)</a><span>, November 5th 2021</span></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.privatdozent.co/p/the-einstein-szilard-letter" rel="">The Einstein-Szilárd Letter (1939)</a><span>, June 7th 2021</span></p></li></ul><p>At the time of the writing of this essay, the Privatdozent newsletter goes out to 11,610 subscribers via Substack. </p><p><strong>Bernstein, J.
