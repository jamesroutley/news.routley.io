    <h1>SpaceX is behind schedule, so NASA will open Artemis III contract to competition</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>NASA&#39;s Acting Administrator has admitted that SpaceX is behind in plans to return astronauts to the Moon, has reopened lander contract competition, and pushed the deadline for a lunar landing to the end of the Trump administration in 2029.</p>
<p>Elon Musk, the boss of SpaceX, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1980335879945351303">fired back</a>: &#34;SpaceX is moving like lightning compared to the rest of the space industry. Moreover, Starship will end up doing the whole Moon mission. Mark my words.&#34;</p>
<p>As we <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/16/spacexs_starship_two_down_a/">noted</a> last week, SpaceX has a mountain to climb to develop NASA&#39;s Human Landing System (HLS). After a slew of unplanned explosions, the company achieved two sub-orbital missions for its monster rocket - impressive, but still more than 200,000 miles (322,000 km) from the Moon.</p>

    

<p>NASA&#39;s patience has worn thin. Despite praising SpaceX as an &#34;amazing company&#34; doing &#34;remarkable things,&#34; Acting Administrator Sean Duffy <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/SecDuffyNASA/status/1980243865400701369">said</a> the company was &#34;behind schedule&#34; and he&#39;s opening the astronaut landing contract to competition. &#34;The President wants to make sure we beat the Chinese. He wants to get there in his term.&#34;</p>

        


        

<p>So, Artemis III could be slipping to the end of 2028 (or January 2029 at a pinch), and SpaceX might not be doing the landing. Duffy called out Blue Origin, &#34;and maybe others,&#34; as alternatives to Musk&#39;s rocketeers.</p>
<p>In 2021, SpaceX bagged the lunar lander <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/04/16/nasa_spacex_moon/">contract</a>, beating Jeff Bezos&#39; Blue Origin and Dynetics. The inevitable lawsuit from Blue Origin was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/16/blue_origin_lawsuit/">filed</a> in August that year, which halted work for a few months, before the claims were <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/05/blue_origin_nasa_spacex_court/">dismissed</a> in November, 2021.</p>

        

<p>The original 2024 landing target has already slipped to 2027 — but even that looks increasingly unrealistic. Artemis II won&#39;t launch until 2026, and in September, NASA&#39;s Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/22/nasa_starship_artemis_doubts/">expressed serious doubts</a> about SpaceX&#39;s HLS readiness.</p>
<p>According to a New York Times <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/20/us/politics/spacex-us-moon-race.html">report</a>, the HLS variant of Starship might not be ready until 2032. Musk <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1969492141152817636">dismissed it</a>: &#34;It&#39;s not worth lining a parrot cage with NY Times, let alone reading it.&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>Yet Duffy&#39;s announcement confirms NASA is finally acknowledging that SpaceX is behind and 2027 is wishful thinking rather than reality.</p>
<p>Blue Origin <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/marshall/nasa-selects-blue-origin-as-second-artemis-lunar-lander-provider/">is currently scheduled</a> to land a crew on the Moon with Artemis V in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/nasa-fiscal-year-2025-budget-summary.pdf">2030</a> [PDF, page 6]. As the Apollo program demonstrated, sufficient government funding can put boots on the regolith quickly. SpaceX can also rebid.</p>
<p>The bigger question is that with NASA&#39;s budget already struggling to maintain current <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/12/nasa_science_gets_a_boost/">science funding</a>, where will the agency find the cash needed to land astronauts before Trump&#39;s term ends? ®</p>
