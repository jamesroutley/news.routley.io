    <h1>Old School Visual Effects: The Cloud Tank (2010)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Great article, I love old-school vfx and it&#39;s great to see someone who appreciates them so much! Ken Ralston is probably right about that type of cloud tank (i.e. different water density layers) going back to The Ten Commandments. However, cloud tanks in general go back further. A precursor to it could be seen in The Good Earth (1937) in which long shots of a swarm of locusts were apparently achieved with tea leaves poured into a water tank. Later, we see an unambiguous cloud tank in The Beginning or The End (1947), a drama-documentary about the Manhattan Project. Head of vfx A Arnold Gillespie found that usable film of A-bomb explosions was hard to come by. Whilst puzzling over how to simulate the A-bomb mushroom cloud, he remembered scenes in old pre-war Tarzan films he&#39;d worked on in which the eponymous jungle-man fought with rubber crocodiles underwater; the stabbed blood-sacs released clouds which formed interesting patterns under water. So Gillespie set up a water tank and after much experimentation managed to convincingly simulate the A-bomb cloud over Hiroshima. At the end of the rather humdrum sci-fi film Satellite in the Sky (1956) an A-bomb explodes in space, an effect clearly achieved with a cloud tank, and Toho&#39;s vfx supremo Eiji Tsuburaya got in on the act in 1961 in The Last War; the H-bomb explosion over Tokyo appears to use a combination of techniques, including a cloud tank and animation.</p><p><span><a target="_self" data-comment-id="5061896110890391078">Reply</a><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/comment/delete/4097599682335202574/5061896110890391078">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></div>
