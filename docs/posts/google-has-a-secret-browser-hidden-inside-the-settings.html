    <h1>Google has a secret browser hidden inside the settings</h1>

(But look at the glass half full: it still doesn’t <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-is-displaying-multiple-edge-ads-on-googles-chrome-download-page">advertise itself on the installation page of other browsers</a>).</p><p>But there are another things that prevent this browser from being a secure browser: The dangerous functions.</p><h3>The dangerous functions:</h3><p>As I was using this browser, I discovered a strange thing. A weird JavaScript object named <code>mm</code>. To see this, go to <a href="https://eruda.liriliri.io/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://eruda.liriliri.io/">eruda</a>, (just because it’s the best mobile JavaScript console I know) and type <code>mm</code></p><div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="490" height="523" src="https://matan-h.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eruda-mm.png" alt="Screenshot of eruda expend the `mm` object" srcset="https://matan-h.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eruda-mm.png 490w, https://matan-h.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eruda-mm-281x300.png 281w, https://matan-h.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/eruda-mm-300x320.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 490px) 100vw, 490px"/><figcaption>Screenshot of eruda expend the <code>mm</code> object</figcaption></figure></div><p>As you see, there are three functions:</p><p>Let’s start with <code>closeView</code>() function, because it’s the only clear function: it just closes your browser, as would happen if you press the back key. Not a standard JavaScript function, but nothing to worry about. (you can try it right there by typing into eruda ‘<code>mm.closeView()</code>‘)</p><p>Then you have two methods which I don’t know what they do, but they sound scary. As this is a secret-browser of the ‘on-device encryption’ feature, I can guess, they are both used to <strong>set your local encryption keys</strong>. So it looks like a malicious website can put their keys there, and try to make you pay for them!</p><p>I think this is the time to tell you that I already reported this to Google, and they say this is not a security vulnerability (probably because this secret browser is not very popular), and that the parental control bypass is the “Intended Behavior” 🙂</p><div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="686" height="98" src="https://matan-h.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4.png" alt="" srcset="https://matan-h.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4.png 686w, https://matan-h.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-4-300x43.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px"/><figcaption>Google’s answer to my report</figcaption></figure></div><p>If you enjoy using it, please let me know in the comments what you did with it.</p><p>Hope you enjoy your (new?) browser that you didn’t know you had !</p></div><!-- .entry-content --></article><!-- #post-263 --><!-- #comments --></main><!-- #main --></div><!-- #primary --><!-- #secondary --></div></div></div>
