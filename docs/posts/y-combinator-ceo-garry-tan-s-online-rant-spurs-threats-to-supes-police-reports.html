    <h1>Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan&#39;s online rant spurs threats to supes, police reports</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		
		
<p>At least two San Francisco supervisors received a threatening letter at their homes on Tuesday and two more filed police reports after Garry Tan, the CEO of Y Combinator and a heavy campaign donor to efforts to oust progressive politicians, <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/01/garry-tan-death-wish-sf-supervisors/">posted online that seven supervisors should die a slow death</a>.</p>



<p>Tan wrote “Die slow motherfuckers” in reference to Supervisors Aaron Peskin, Connie Chan, Myrna Melgar, Shamann Walton, Hillary Ronen, Dean Preston and Ahsha Safaí in a <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/01/garry-tan-death-wish-sf-supervisors/">late-night rant Saturday</a>. During his online tirade, Tan <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/01/garry-tan-death-wish-sf-supervisors/">posted photos of his private liquor stash, and indicated to a fellow Twitter-user that he was inebriated</a>. </p>



<p>The “die slow, motherfucker” line was a reference to a Tupac Shakur song, and Tan later apologized. That 1996 song, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41qC3w3UUkU">Hit ‘Em Up</a>,” escalated the simmering East Coast-West Coast rap rivalry into a lethal feud; Shakur was gunned down three months after its release. </p>




<p>The named supervisors did not take the incident lightly:<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/sf-garry-tan-x-threatening-peskin-police-report-18637813.php"> Peskin and Chan</a> on Tuesday <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/sf-garry-tan-x-threatening-peskin-police-report-18637813.php">filed police reports</a>, Melgar and Safaí have pledged to do the same and both Peskin and Preston today received a letter to their homes citing Tan’s diatribe and wishing death upon them and their families.</p>



<p>When asked if she felt personally threatened by Tan’s behavior, Chan responded “Seeing what my colleague[s] received in the mail? Yes, absolutely. I have a 10-year-old. I do not tell people where my child attends school.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/sf-garry-tan-x-threatening-peskin-police-report-18637813.php">The <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> first reported </a>the hate mail sent to Preston and the police reports filed by Chan and Peskin. Peskin at 8:40 p.m. confirmed to Mission Local that he, too, received a threatening letter at his home. The envelope was emblazoned with a smiling portrait of Tan.</p>



<p>“Garry Tan is right!” the letter sent to Peskin, Preston and, perhaps, others read. “I wish a slow and painful death for you and your loved ones.”</p>

<p>Preston has in particular drawn the venom of Tan: Preston is the lone democratic socialist on the Board of Supervisors, an odious position to Tan, and Tan has donated $5,000 to Preston’s opponent and <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/07/31/dump-dean-preston-pac-growsf-declares-war-sf-supervisor-election/">pledged</a> another $50,000 to the effort to unseat him.</p>




<p>Bizarrely, the letter to Preston and Peskin concluded: “This mail was sent to communicate a political opinion. No threats were intended.”</p>



<p>The board’s five Jewish members — Peskin, Ronen, Melgar, Preston and Rafael Mandelman — <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/10/20/sickening-antisemitic-postcard-mailed-to-homes-of-5-san-francisco-supervisors/">in October received antisemitic postcards</a> at their homes. Peskin said multiple supervisors have received as many as four more antisemitic letters or postcards since then. </p>



<p>He noted that the exact phrase “This mail was sent to communicate a political opinion. No threats were intended” was written on one of the disturbing communiques he received earlier. </p>



<p>Chan says she received a letter in December at her home accusing her of “white genocide.” Chan, who is Chinese, is married to a white man and has a mixed-race child. </p>



<p>While she first thought to “brush off” Tan’s comments, Chan says she was initially unaware how tied in he is politically. She then learned that Tan has hosted numerous moderate supervisor candidates at his home, including her major challenger, Marjan Philhour.</p>




<p>Chan, in her police report, notes that she had filed a prior report last year against Philhour’s staffer, Forrest Liu, whom she accuses of twice physically threatening her — publicly and in person.</p>



<p>After realizing the association of Tan to Philhour to Liu, she said “it then dawned on me that these unhinged individuals who have wished me death online as well as physically threaten me are connected, it became alarming to me that the threats are potentially violent and imminent.” </p>



<p>Liu did not respond to requests for comment. </p>



<p>Tan has indeed hosted San Francisco moderate political figures at his Mission District home, including District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, Philhour and District 9 candidate Trevor Chandler.</p>



<p>Philhour and Chandler both criticized their backer Tan in light of his comments.</p>



<p>“Threats to one’s life or safety have no place in political discourse,” Philhour said.</p>



<p>“It is never okay to advocate violence, be it seriously or in jest,” said Chandler. </p>



<p>Jenkins did not respond to requests for comment.</p>



<p>Peskin today asked the City Attorney’s Office to look into requiring public disclosures from recipients of political donations from “purveyors of hate and violence.” </p>



<p>“When individuals in our society, especially and most concerning those with money,</p>



<p>But tying this potential legislation to the message Tan communicated to his 408,000 Twitter followers would appear to be a serious legal challenge: Half a dozen lawyers and judges told Mission Local that, however ill-advised, Tan’s comments do not rise to the legal definition of a death threat. </p>



<p><a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;sectionNum=422.">Under Penal Code 422</a>, a person making a criminal threat must harbor “specific intent that the statement, made verbally, in writing, or by means of an electronic communication device, is to be taken as a threat…” </p>



<p>“It is offensive, but it is speech protected by the First Amendment,” said Berkeley School of Law dean Erwin Chemerinsky. “It does not meet the standard for incitement.” </p>



<p>Tan is a well-heeled donor for San Francisco’s moderate causes and candidates. He sits on the board of Grow SF, a political pressure group favoring moderate causes and candidates and targeting progressives. Tan gave more than $100,000 to the <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/05/explore-almost-9-million-donated-for-and-against-boudin-recall/">2022 campaign to recall then-District Attorney Chesa Boudin</a>. He gave at least $20,000 to the <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/01/who-is-funding-the-school-board-recall/">2021 school board recall</a>, too.</p>



<p>Tan could not be reached for comment. Neither Y Combinator nor Grow SF immediately responded to requests for comment.</p>
