    <h1>Arcan-A12: Weaving a Different Web</h1>

					<p>This article is a companion piece to <a href="https://arcan-fe.com/?p=7841">“Arcan Explained: A browser for
						different Webs”</a> which covered how Arcan works as a browser engine.
Some key takeaways from that article are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The focus is only on running networked applications where the
outermost one takes on the responsibilities of window management and
display control, becoming the ‘desktop’.</p></li>
<li><p>Document browsing is a compilation step through separate tools
that generates a signed, shareable application package.</p></li>
<li><p>It is recursive (an application can embed others, including
itself) and can compose and interact with allow-listed local
software.</p></li>
<li><p>Media decoding, media transforms, network communication and
system integration are all delegated to per-instance sets of
interchangeable privilege-separated programs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It is essentially a browser take on a microkernel architecture. The
choice in network communication program will control resource retrieval,
link resolution, discovery and so on. This determines what kind of a web
you end up in.</p>
<p>The reason why this is posted here and not on the main Arcan site is
to emphasise this decoupling. It is but one possible solution, and there
will be better ideas out there, without someone having to boil the ocean
in order to try them out.</p>
<p>This article covers the design and choices of the included default
implementation (<code>afsrv_net</code>), its command-line helper tool
(<code>arcan-net</code>) and how they leverage the A12 protocol to form
a web.</p>
<p>It is organised as follows:</p>
<p>In <a href="#recalling-the-old-ways">Recalling the old ways</a>
we take a trip down memory lane back to the days of bulletin board systems to
look for good bits to bring back into style.</p>
<p>In <a href="#a-frayed-web-of-separate-worlds">A frayed web of separate worlds</a>
we argue that the ‘World Wide Web’ is anything but ‘World Wide’ and cover a set
of problems that we want our solution to cover.</p>
<p>In <a href="#a12-as-protocol">A12 as protocol</a> we go through the characteristics of the
protocol that we are building the rest on top of.</p>
<p>In <a href="#a12-web">A12 Web</a> we layer in designs to address the problems of a frayed
web using the A12 protocol, along with some properties we want it to
have.</p>
<p>Finally, in <a href="#developer-story">Developer Story</a> we get practical and go through the use
of the tools available to actually build something.</p>

<p>My early access to the Internet started through Bulletin Board
Systems, specifically ones that translated select Usenet discussion
groups and relayed e-mail over a system called ‘Echomail’.</p>
<p>If those words are unfamiliarly to you, a BBS was mainly someone
sharing a slice of their computer to others over a telephone network.
This was served to one or a few people at a time because each active
connection required a designated telephone line and those were
expensive.</p>
<p>See also: <a href="https://archive.org/details/BBS.The.Documentary">The BBS
documentary</a>.</p>
<p>Most of the boards I frequented had a very personal feel to them. It
was more like being allowed inside someone’s computing living room than
being presented with a streamlined and well-dressed corporate
facade.</p>

<p>It was at once both intimate and intimidating on the rare few
occasions when the SysOp (“System Operator”) decided to “break into
chat” and your browsing of the local wares was interrupted by a
seemingly inescapable one-to-one chat window.</p>
<p>Finding out about these places was an interesting journey in itself.
Initial <em>discovery</em> was by word of mouth through a friend of a
friend. As things sobered up, magazines took to providing listings. Here
the experiences were on the milder side. There was less profanity and
rarely mischief manuals (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchist_Cookbook">“the Anarchist’s Cookbook”</a>), erotica or
pirated software. Secondary discovery came through
<a href="http://bbslist.textfiles.com/sweden/0451/0451.txt">sitelists</a>
which the sysops curated themselves, or that someone had dumped into a shared
upload directory or snuck into the ‘release information’ files packaged inside
some piece of downloadable software.</p>
<p>Often enough a phone number did not actually lead to the board in
question. Instead of the familiar tone of the modem connection handshake
you got the voice of someone who did not appreciate being woken up at
two in the morning – perhaps you had misread the operating hours/days
(not everything was 24/7) or the sysop had grown tired of it all and
closed the thing down. Such is life.</p>
<p>From this shallow description alone we can see the outline of some
sort of troubled web story: Through word of mouth <em>links</em> between
a named entry (Larry’s Land of Leisure and Suites thereof) and an
<em>address</em> (here, phone-number) you could access resources,
including <em>links</em> to other resources.</p>
<p>As far as links go, they were not particularly good:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unidirectional - unless told, the one being linked to was unaware
of who referred to them and thus had no say as to whether the extra
attention was appreciated or not.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-descriptive - you had to try and resolve the link to figure
out what it actually linked to, or if it was even valid in the first
place.</p></li>
<li><p>Constraints as a side channel - “open between 08.00pm to 06.00am
Fri-Sun” was something that might be mentioned on a login screen (less
than helpful) or on the sitelist. Accuracy varied wildly.</p></li>
<li><p>Local resources were not addressable - you could point someone in
the general direction of something, but once they were connected to the
board itself the true hunt began.</p></li>
<li><p>Local termination - resolving a link does not let you find
further ones without processing the resources at the linked
location.</p></li>
<li><p>Ephemeral - should the address mapping change, there is no
mechanism to rediscover the linked resource through other paths in the
network.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Much of this and more still apply to links on the world “wide” web.
To their credit URLs did fix addressing local resources (for a time) and
DNS did something about the ephemerality, only to be undone by
shortening services.</p>
<p>Still, think how much less useful even the first versions of HTML
would have been without local resources being part of the language of
the ‘link’. The technical solution is about as trivial as can be, yet
the consequences are massive.</p>
<p>As a snack for thought, take the ‘local termination’ part: this is
rather unusual if you think about the underlying data structure; it is a
graph, but it is not exposed as such. A link may lead to other links,
but first you need to ‘scrape’ (download, parse, extract) them from the
outer resource.</p>
<p>This left a big discoverability hole to fill, one big enough to spawn
some of the wealthiest companies in the world. It may be tempting to
think how things would turn out if the other weaknesses had been
addressed as well.</p>
<p>The obvious elephant in the room is Ted Nelson’s poetic <a href="https://www.xanadu.net">Xanadu</a> and how it keeps being brought
up as the ‘what could have been’ solution because it used backlinks to
avoid unidirectionality and transclusions for subcontent referencing.
</p>
<center><figure><img src="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2026/01/26/a12web/transclusion.gif"/><figcaption>Xanadu transclusions</figcaption></figure></center>
<p>Alas, the rest of its ‘web as living document’ story had a very niche appeal,
and the browser part was vapourware for the longest time and then very quirky
and unintuitive. As important as the linking story is for the base layer of a
web, there also needs to be something there: content is king.</p>
<p>Tech doesn’t just go away, but rather move into one of many
retirement homes for <a href="https://www.telnetbbsguide.com/">retrocomputing romantics</a>. I
don’t recall a strong inflection point where the BBS stopped being my
primary source for information and exploration, it “just happened” as an
uncoordinated silent shift. The Internet just naturally became the new
default, but the transition and loss of something could be felt.</p>
<p>The real kicker was the shift in discovery, with search engines as
the natural new starting point, some being Web while also somehow not
being ‘Web’, like NTNU.no’s FTP search. They quickly became the way to
discover content. More seasoned explorers, like the late and great <a href="https://fravia.accessroot.com/">+Fravia</a> pivoted from using
disassemblers and debuggers to reverse the dynamic structure of
computing, to unpacking the search engine ‘command-line’ to reverse the
structure of the web.</p>
<p>Other discovery solutions were curated collections of links as
‘portals’, like the original Yahoo. Those were similar to magazine
sitelists, which also switched to providing links as URLs rather than
phone numbers.</p>
<center><figure><img src="https://www.divergent-desktop.org/blog/2026/01/26/a12web/yahoo.png"/><figcaption>Yahoo as portal for Web Discovery (1995)</figcaption></figure></center>
<p>It might seem comical and distant now but there was real value in
buying a computer magazine for suggestions on where to go on the web.
Several Internet Service Providers at the time did go through the extra
effort of bundling subscriptions to such magazines. Still even echoes of
BBS form discovery remained for a while in the shape of ‘Web rings’ and
IRC chatbots serving sitelists.</p>
<p>To shorten the story somewhat I will skip past the evolution of
forums into ‘community’ sites, how they were replaced by ‘social media’
and so on. Instead I will simply suggest that the ‘web’ oscillates
between different modalities, like (open, distributed, public) to
(closed, centralised, invite-only). The nudge needed to switch the trend
from the one to the other, is spam.</p>

<p>The ‘open web’ has, to me, become the least useful resource on the
Internet, and that rapidly accelerated to large hadron levels with the
sheer amount of bullshit synthesis that has weaseled its way in between
me and whatever I was searching for or whoever I was communicating
with.</p>
<p>I am anything but alone in feeling this disconnect. For a well worded
view on the matter, look no further than <a href="https://ploum.net/2023-08-01-splitting-the-web.html">Splitting the
Web</a>. That is, if your browser still allows you to, and the link is
still working.</p>

<p>One thing that the many web pundits I have spoken to over the years
have in common when asked to narrow down what the web ‘is’, is a certain
glee over unity. Grab a (reasonable) device! And a browser! Browse the
web! From anywhere!</p>
<p>This doesn’t answer the question and does not match any reality of
mine. I have reasonable devices in every form factor, and an even larger
pile of completely unreasonable ones. I use several browsers, but it is
an exceptional day if two browsers on two different devices behave even
close to the same.</p>
<p>Heck, if two browsers run on the same device but gets different
geolocated source IPs they are served different content on the regular,
and more so when using choice examples, say between China to Japan or
whether the almighty Cloudflare deems you worthy or not. That is a
rather narrow idea of ‘world-wide’.</p>
<p>For every other click I am supposed to prove my humanity by clicking
a box or waiting a few seconds while my computer crunch pointless
numbers. Possibly both.</p>
<p>So where is it? Hardly in the protocol. Otherwise we could have
dropped that part of the URL long ago. Even before shifts towards the
likes of QUIC or TLS (or is it SSL?) becoming ubiquitous, browsers
implemented a wide range of them, from Gopher and FTP to RTSP.</p>
<p>You also won’t find it in the myriad of document containers or the
resources referenced inside. What once was ‘Flash’ or ‘Silverlight’ is
now an exercise in computing necromancy to relive. Is that javascript of
yours following ECMAScript.1997 or 2025?. One day you might get to see
that PNG as JXL, if the Gods so decide.</p>
<p>If you are not big on appealing to the authority of the W3C, what you
are left with now are the links and how people use them. As we implied
previously, the properties of ‘links’ and how they are discovered and
enable discovery largely controls what kind of web that emerges.</p>

<p>Discord is an interesting phenomenon that deserves to be included
here for a handful of reasons. I will fight the urge to attempt a larger
breakdown, but it does serve as a connection to the BBS story from
before, albeit in sheep’s clothing.</p>
<p>To the owners it is probably the happiest of little accidents, just
like the Covid pandemic was to Slack. The numbers displayed on Wikipedia
and friends are probably imaginary, but suggestions around 3 million
accounts in 2016 to well over 500 million in 2025, and a little less
than that actually active, seem reasonable. That
is quite something for what was basically paratext and coordination
around gaming – maybe the ‘Linux desktop’ could learn something from
this.</p>

<p>The connection to the BBS story is that it gives you a turnkey
solution for spinning up your own ‘personal’ ‘server’. In reality it is
anything but, merely a namespace where you only get to partially define
a small set of the rules, but at least you get to pick an icon or
something.</p>
<p>The actual agency is more like the old surveillance camera meme:</p>
