                    <h2>1. <i>Introduction</i></h2>
                    <p>The <span>enemy</span> has a new form. Today&#39;s wars are fought from computer
                        consoles; climate disinformation campaigns are planned in web conferences; decisions to deny
                        healthcare are codified in software.</p>
                    <p>Free and just futures demand new strategies.</p>
                    <p>Unassuming civilians have an outsized ability to make a difference by directly impacting the
                        ordinary services we build and maintain everyday. Many small actions can create a constant and
                        tangible drag on the systems of violence and exploitation. When tyranny suffers, we create an
                        opportunity for more sustainable and prosperous systems to replace it.</p>
                    <p>These ideas are specific suggestions for taking action in this new theater.</p>
                    <p>This is not a guide for overt displays of heroism. Surveillance is abundant in the 21st century
                        work environment. Presented here are practical, everyday actions for reducing systemic harm
                        while minimizing vulnerability.</p>
                    <p>These are Specific Suggestions for <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26184" target="_blank">Simple Sabotage</a> in the 21st century.</p>

                    <h2>2. <i>Simple Sabotage</i></h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Simple sabotage is more than malicious mischief, and it should always consist of acts whose
                            results will be detrimental to the tools and systems of oppression.</li>
                        <li>Occurring on a wide scale, simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the
                            operations of hostile systems, making it possible for just, resilient, and thriving ones to
                            take their place.</li>
                        <li>Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an
                            ordinary person, and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of
                            injury, detection, and retaliation.</li>
                        <li>The saboteur should be creative in using their every-day instruments. Opportunities will
                            present themselves if one looks at their surroundings in a different light. For example,
                            disabling the productivity of an entire workplace may at first seem impossible, but if the
                            saboteur were to unplug a single wifi access point within a space, work might grind to a
                            halt.</li>
                        <li>Where destruction is involved, the weapons of the saboteur are materials and tools they
                            might normally be expected to possess in their particular occupation. Their arsenal is the
                            conference room, the email client, their own usual software applications and supplies. The
                            targets of sabotage are objects to which they have normal and inconspicuous access in
                            everyday life.</li>
                        <li>There is also a type of simple sabotage that requires no destructive tools whatsoever and
                            produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. It is based on universal
                            opportunities to make faulty decisions and generally slow the efficiency of a hostile
                            process. Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of committing software changes to
                            one repository instead of another or copying the wrong person onto an email.
                            <p>
                                This type of activity, sometimes referred to as the &#34;human element,&#34; is frequently
                                responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions.
                                The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and operations are
                                normally found in their work and should then devise their sabotage so as to enlarge that
                                &#34;margin for error&#34; while avoiding detection.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>The saboteur should never attack targets beyond their capacity or the capacity of their
                            tools. An inexperienced person should not, for example, attempt to deploy malware or falsify
                            legal documents, but should make use of familiar tools to carry out their work.</li>
                        <li>The saboteur finds power in the routine, the inconspicuous, and the mundane.</li>
                        <li>The saboteur should try to damage only objects, materials, and systems known to be used to
                            carry out oppression or to be destined for use in harmful systems. (It will be safe to
                            assume that almost any surveillance technology is destined for oppressive use.) Without
                            special knowledge, however, it would be undesirable to attempt destruction of accessibility
                            technologies or interfere with the distribution of health services.</li>
                        <li>The saboteur should never aim to hinder aid.</li>
                        <li>Potential saboteurs should vigilantly consider the extent of surveillance in contemporary
                            work environments. <strong>Assume all actions are monitored</strong> when using an
                            employer-provided digital device, such as a computer or smartphone, or on personal devices
                            after any employer-provided software is installed onto them. Devices provided for public use
                            like those in libraries should also be used with caution.</li>
                        <li>Although the saboteur may rarely have direct access to explicitly malicious processes—such
                            as eviction and displacement, ecological destruction, or the manufacture of anti-personnel
                            weapons—they should prioritize these above all others.</li>
                        <li>It will not be possible to evaluate the desirability of simple sabotage in an organization
                            without having in mind what specific individual acts and results are embraced by the
                            definition of simple sabotage.</li>
                        <li>Access to these materials should not depend upon any one individual and should be published
                            widely to increase resilience.</li>
                    </ol>

                        <li>Unplugging routers, committing buggy code, changing file extensions, acting absentminded,
                            feigning ignorance, and hiding key technologies and supplies will waste the materials,
                            manpower, and time of the enemy. Sabotage may be as mundane as leaving the caps off of
                            shared dry erase markers or as complex as supporting unprofitable business objectives.</li>
