<p>If you knew me in 1984, you would also know that you could find me <a href="https://scottandrew.com/wordpress/archives/2013/04/save_early_save_often">glued to a chair in front of our family&#39;s Atari 800 personal computer</a>, typing out BASIC programs from issues of COMPUTE! magazine and letting the summer days go by. I was also obsessed with the <a href="http://infocom-if.org/games/games.html">Infocom series of text adventure games</a>, although I&#39;d have to go to a friend&#39;s house to play them because they were almost exclusively for the Commodore 64.</p>
<p>So <em>of course</em> I set out to make my own text adventure game! <em>The Plot of the Phantom</em> was a Zork-alike dungeon crawl with plenty of hide-and-seek puzzle quests for objects required to advance the game (e.g. to open a door, you needed to find the key, which was in the bucket at the bottom of the well, but you needed to find a rope first, etc.). I spent most of the summer working on it, only to be flummoxed when the game completely consumed the 64K (expanded!) of RAM available. A year or so later I got involved in my high school&#39;s theatre program and started learning how to play electric guitar, and programming didn&#39;t feel that important anymore. So the floppy disks went into a box along with the computer and peripherals and it sat my parent&#39;s house until one day it was sold and that was that.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s now time-travel to the future a bit. It&#39;s 2018, and I&#39;ve somehow gotten myself a career in software engineering, despite getting D&#39;s in maths and a BA in English that took five years to complete. I&#39;m on a leave of absence, and I&#39;m poking around <a href="https://playfic.com">Playfic</a> marveling at the thousands of text adventure games written by hobbyists. This is how I learn about the existence of <a href="https://ganelson.github.io/inform-website/">Inform 7</a>, a modern programming language for creating text adventures (&#34;interactive fiction&#34; in today&#39;s parlance) that run on ported versions of the original Infocom software.</p>
<p>So I have an idea.</p>
<p><img src="https://scottandrew.com/img/2025/dungeon-objects-fragment.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>The <em>The Plot of the Phantom</em> code was gone, but I still had the original notebook of maps and objects. How fun would it be to recreate the game using the same virtual machine that Infocom used to create <em>Zork?</em>  Well, not fun enough at the time I guess, because I quickly forgot about it after my leave ended.</p>
<p>But then: COVID. Stuck working from home, protests everywhere, wildfires turing the sky orange, a terrible election year. I needed something to escape, and that&#39;s when I pulled out that notebook started tinkering with Inform 7. I hadn&#39;t written down everything so it took some time to remember how some of the rooms and puzzles worked. I did some editing, removing some rooms, getting rid of scoring and treasure hunting, and — important! — changing the ending to be a lot less violent (I blame 80s action movies).</p>
<p>As I went about recreating my minature world, the backstory started to become...<em>meta.</em> The original version didn&#39;t actually have a story arc, you just had to get from one end of the dungeon to the other. Today the game has some references to the kid I was in 1984, and in some ways is a bit autobiographical. There are some new objects to examine and puzzles to explore, but the new game is largely what it was back then.</p>
<p>And now, it&#39;s finished. <a href="https://scottandrew.com/plot-of-the-phantom/">After forty years, you can now play <em>The Plot of the Phantom</em> in your web browser</a>. It&#39;s pretty short, and it&#39;s not particularly difficult either, especially if you&#39;ve played similar games. You can probably finish it in an hour or two.</p>
<p>I&#39;m kind of <em>happysad</em> about it? It feels little bit like putting a ghost to rest.</p>
<p>Anyway, I enjoyed making some retro box art! Look close, there are clues.</p>
