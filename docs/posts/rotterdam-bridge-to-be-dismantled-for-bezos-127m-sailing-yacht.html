    <h1>Rotterdam bridge to be dismantled for Bezos&#39; 127m sailing yacht</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div> <p>The Koningshaven bridge in Rotterdam is set to be dismantled to allow Oceanco&#39;s 127 metre sailing yacht project, known as <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/the-superyacht-directory/y721--98581" rel="" target="">Y721</a>, to pass through.</p>
<p>Dutch media outlet <em>Rijnmond </em>reported that the centre portion of the bridge, known by locals as De Hef, would need to be removed to accommodate the record-breaking build. The 127 metre Oceanco sailing yacht was reportedly commissioned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and is set to become the <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/the-register/top-largest-sailing-yachts--25057" rel="" target="">world&#39;s largest sailing yacht when delivered later this year</a>, unseating the current titleholder <em>Sea Cloud</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/the-register/top-largest-sailing-yachts--25057" data-gtm-id="onward-journey"><span>Read More</span><span>/</span><span>Top 10 largest sailing yachts in the world</span></a></p><div><div data-testid="image-details"><p>This image and top: Ruben Griffioen</p></div></div> <p>The Koningshaven bridge was subject to a large-scale restoration project in 2017, which makes it a point of controversy in the municipality. Oceanco reportedly approached the local government and requested that the bridge be temporarily dismantled as its 40 metre clearance would not be enough to accommodate the trio of masts on board Y721.</p>
<p>Marcel Walravens who managed the renovation project, told <a href="https://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/1461348/de-hef-wordt-ontmanteld-voor-megajacht-van-rijkste-man-ter-wereld" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Rijnmond</em></a> that it was &#34;not practical&#34; to partially finish the vessel and complete the build elsewhere. &#34;If you carry out a big job somewhere, you want all your tools in that place. Otherwise you have to go back and forth constantly. In addition, this is such a large project that there are hardly any locations where this work is finished.&#34;</p>  <p>He added: &#34;From an economic perspective and maintaining employment, the municipality considers this a very important project. Rotterdam has also been declared the maritime capital of Europe. Shipbuilding and activity within that sector are therefore an important pillar for the municipality.&#34;</p> <p><a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/news/yachts-owned-by-tech-billionaires" data-gtm-id="onward-journey"><span>Read More</span><span>/</span><span>The superyachts owned by tech moguls</span></a></p><div><div data-testid="image-details"><p>The mammoth 127 metre sailing superyacht has been revealed for the first time</p><p>Credit Tom Van Oossanen</p></div></div> <p>Y721 is the longest yacht to have been built in the Netherlands and the largest ever superyacht built at Oceanco. The yacht was first glimpsed in October 2021 as she was rolled out of the sheds at the Dutch shipyard. The project features a black hull, white superstructure and classic exterior lines. </p> <div><div data-testid="image-details"><p>The yacht is set to become the largest sailing yacht in the world when delivered in 2022</p><p>Credit: Tom van Oossanen</p></div></div> <p>In September 2021, a book named <em>Amazon Unbound </em>appeared to confirm the long-standing rumours that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is the owner of the secretive 127 metre sailing yacht. An excerpt, which was published by Bloomberg, described the superyacht as “one of the finest sailing yachts in existence,” with &#34;several decks&#34; and &#34;three enormous masts.&#34; The book reports that an accompanying support boat is also under construction.</p>  <p>Oceanco is no stranger to record-breaking superyachts. The shipyard delivered the 106.7-metre <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/the-superyacht-directory/black-pearl--39361" rel="" target=""><em>Black Pearl </em></a>in 2018, which remains the largest DynaRig sailing yacht in the world, characterised by three 70 metre-tall carbon masts.</p>  <p>20An Oceanco spokesperson said: &#34;Oceanco values the privacy and confidentiality of all our clients and prospective clients and therefore does not comment on our involvement or non-involvement in specific projects.&#34;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/boat-pro" rel="" target="">BOAT Pro</a>, the record-breaking yacht will make its official debut in 2022</p> </div></div></div>
