    <p>MirageOS is a library operating system that constructs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unikernel">unikernels</a> for secure, high-performance network applications across a variety of cloud computing and mobile platforms.</p>

    <p>Code can be developed on a normal OS such as Linux or macOS, and then compiled into a fully-standalone, specialised unikernel that runs under a Xen or KVM hypervisor.</p>

    <p>This lets your services run more efficiently, securely and with finer control than with a full conventional software stack.</p>

      <p>MirageOS applications take a few milliseconds to start-up instead of the few minutes that traditional OSes take.</p>

      </div>
      <p>MirageOS binaries are self-contained: they do not need an additional OS to execute. Even then, the size of MirageOS binary is usually a few megabytes.</p>

      </div>
      <p>MirageOS applications use a few megabytes of memory, while traditional applications and their associated OS waste gigabytes for simple applications.</p>

      <p>MirageOS applications are written in OCaml, an industrial strength programming language supporting functional, imperative and object-oriented styles.</p>

      MirageOS uses the <a href="https://ocaml.org/">OCaml</a> language, with <a href="https://github.com/mirage">libraries</a> that provide networking, storage and concurrency support that work under Unix during development, but become operating system drivers
      when being compiled for production deployment.
    </p>

    <p>The framework is fully event-driven, with no support for preemptive threading.</p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://medium.com/blog/announcing-mirage-40">MirageOS 4.0</a> was released in March 2022, preceded by <a href="https://medium.com/blog/announcing-mirage-30-release">MirageOS 3.0</a> in February 2017, and <a href="https://medium.com/blog/announcing-mirage-20-release">MirageOS 2.0</a> in July 2014, and <a href="https://medium.com/blog/announcing-mirage10">MirageOS 1.0</a> in
      December 2013. All the infrastructure you see here is <a href="https://github.com/mirage/mirage-www">self-hosted</a>.
