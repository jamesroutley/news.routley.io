    <h1>Poll: Where do you live?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I read a tweet that referred to HN as &#34;Silicon Valley&#34;, which struck me as odd because I suspect most HN users, like me, are located elsewhere. This piqued my curiosity about where HN users are located, so if you don&#39;t mind me asking, where do you live?<p>Edit: Sorry about the randomized ordering (I forgot HN does that for polls). Thanks ahead of time for using cmd+f or the equivalent to find and vote for your state or country. Also, each US state is included as &#34;US: {state name}&#34;.</p></td></div></div>
