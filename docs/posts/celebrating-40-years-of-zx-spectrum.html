<p>Well color me old! The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a> (affectionately known as “Speccy” or just “Spectrum” by its fans), one of the best-selling microcomputers of all time, was released 40 years ago today. Can you believe it still has a large and active community creating new content, archiving old content, and hacking on all sorts of hardware?</p>
<p>The Spectrum has always benefited from a massive community supporting it. Especially early on through print magazines like Sinclair User and CRASH that included game reviews, hints and tips, cheats, tutorials, programs, pokes, and more. I know that I and a lot of my colleagues got their start programming on computers like these—whether it was <code>10 PRINT “I AM COOL”</code> or hacking the hex for infinite lives.</p>
<p>In honor of the Speccy’s 40th birthday, here’s a look at ten projects that are still going strong and keeping the magic of Spectrum alive. <strong>You won’t believe number nine!</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> We’ve warned Lee before about these cheezy, clickbaity statements, but it was this, or a terrible joke. Something about Spectrum being a horrible name for a computer made of black plastic and gray rubber keys.</em></p>
<h2>1. ZX Spectrum emulator written in Rust</h2>
<figure id="attachment_64308"><img src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/treasure-island-dizzy-spectrum-zx-emulator-rustzx.png" alt="Screenshot of Treasure Island Dizzy being played in Rustzx." width="100%" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/treasure-island-dizzy-spectrum-zx-emulator-rustzx.png?w=600 600w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/treasure-island-dizzy-spectrum-zx-emulator-rustzx.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" loading="lazy"/><figcaption>Treasure Island Dizzy, my nomination for the best video game and character ever created loaded into Rustzx.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Pacmancoder">@Pacmancoder</a>‘s aptly-named <a href="https://github.com/rustzx/rustzx">Rustzx</a> is a cross-platform ZX Spectrum emulator written in Rust supporting <code>tap</code> (tape), <code>sna</code> (snapshot), <code>scr</code> (screenshot), and <code>rom</code> files. Yes, that’s right—that means you can play your Spectrum games on macOS, Linux, and Windows, or even type out some old programs from your archives.</p>
<p><strong>Did you know?</strong> The Internet Archive has a healthy supply of <a href="https://archive.org/details/zx_spectrum_library_games">Spectrum games</a>, and magazines like <a href="https://archive.org/details/sinclair-user-magazine">Sinclair User</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/details/crash-magazine">Crash</a>.</p>
<h2>2. Play games and write basic in your browser</h2>
<figure id="attachment_64311"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jspeccy3-zx-spectrum-emulator-jetpac.png" alt="Screenshot of Jetpac being played in a web browser." srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jspeccy3-zx-spectrum-emulator-jetpac.png?w=1280 1280w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jspeccy3-zx-spectrum-emulator-jetpac.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jspeccy3-zx-spectrum-emulator-jetpac.png?w=768 768w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jspeccy3-zx-spectrum-emulator-jetpac.png?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"/><figcaption>The original ZX Spectrum version of Jetpac being played on the web. The gameplay still holds up today!</figcaption></figure>
<p>No time (or permissions) to install an emulator on your machine? There’s a Spectrum emulator on the web called <a href="https://jsspeccy.zxdemo.org/">JSSpeccy 3</a> that brings the magic to life in your favorite browser. You can even embed it in your own website. As the name suggests, this is the third version of JSSpeccy—the latest version making user of newer web technologies to make those 8 colors and sounds from the beeper really POP!</p>
<h2>3. Old school, cool tools for disassembling Spectrum software</h2>
<p><strong>What is disassembling?</strong> This is the process of taking an executable and breaking it down into a representation in some form of assembler language so that it is readable by a human.</p>
<figure id="attachment_64421"><img src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/no-no-dissassemble.gif" alt="Animation showing No. 5&#39;s take on disassembly." width="100%" loading="lazy"/><figcaption>If you grew up with a Spectrum, you’ll probably understand this reference / seemingly random animated GIF.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://skoolkit.ca/">SkoolKit</a> provides a suite of tools to disassemble Spectrum software into it’s <code>skool</code> format for further processing—making it possible to organize and annotate the code and make it browsable in HTML amongst other things. Some examples: <a href="https://github.com/mrcook/jetpac-disassembly/blob/master/jetpac.skool">JetPac</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrcook/chuckie-egg-disassembly/blob/master/chuckie-egg.skool">Chuckie Egg</a>, <a href="https://dpt.github.io/The-Great-Escape/">The Great Escape</a>, and <a href="https://skoolkit.ca/disassemblies/">more</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/dpt/The-Great-Escape-in-C">The Great Escape was also recently ported to C</a> by <a href="https://github.com/dpt">@dpt</a>. You can read more about the <a href="http://www.davespace.co.uk/the.great.escape/">process of Reverse Engineering The Great Escape</a> if you’re interested.</p>
<h2>4. Power tools for your tapes</h2>
<p>We’ve talked about <code>tap</code>, <code>sna</code>, <code>scr</code>, <code>rom</code>, and <code>skool</code> files so far. You’d thing that would have covered all of the filetypes. Nope! <a href="https://github.com/shred/tzxtools">Txtools</a> is a collection of command line tools for processing <code>tzx</code> files, a common file format for preserving computer tapes of the ZX Spectrum, but also Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and more. It also supports <code>tsx</code> files, but I’m pretty sure that’s not related to TypeScript.</p>
<p>With it you can convert your old tape recordings or <code>wav</code> files to <code>tzx</code> files, generate tap files for emulators and ZX Spectrum Next (read more about this later), load <code>tzx</code> files into the real hardware, and much more.</p>
<p>Related, the <a href="https://github.com/raydac/zxtap-to-wav">zxtap-to-wav</a> command line tool can, surprise surprise, convert your <code>tap</code> files into <code>wav</code> files. Why would you want to do that? Well, if you have an old MP3 player lying around, for example, an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjMV9rBzsuc">iPod Photo</a>, an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFD2zfD6qa8&amp;t=72s">iPod Nano</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZrVkQUg5J_E">any old tablet/smartphone</a> then you could load them up with all your favorite games. Use one of those MP3 to cassette converters and they’ll all be one tape 🤯</p>
<figure id="attachment_64435"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/cassette-converter-1.png" alt="Image of a cassette adapter." srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/cassette-converter-1.png?w=674 674w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/cassette-converter-1.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px"/><figcaption>I can actually remember when these things were considered “cutting edge” technology.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>5. Write and debug Z80 assembly in VS Code</h2>
<figure id="attachment_64409"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dezog-execution-time.gif?h=479" alt="Animation showing the DeZog VS Code extension" data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption>Feel right at home and step through your code with ease in VS Code.</figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://github.com/maziac/DeZog">DeZog</a> is a VS Code extension providing a development environment for Z80 assembly. Debugging your code today is instantly easier than a few decades ago.</p>
<p>The author has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyRuLT6Io3I">video series exploring programming for the Spectrum in C and Z80 assembly</a> that you might find interesting.</p>
<h2>6. It’s compilation time!</h2>
<p>If you don’t happen to have an old Spectrum just lying around, you can always use <a href="https://github.com/z00m128/sjasmplus">sjasmplus</a>, a Z80 CPU assembly language cross-compiler for Linux, macOS, and Windows packed with a ton of features—most notably, a Lua-based scripting engine.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the difference between a compiler and a cross-compiler?</strong> A compiler takes high level language and turns it into machine code while a cross compiler does the same, but for machines other than the one it was written on.</p>
<h2>7. Testing your assembly code 🔴 ❤️ 🟢 🟢 💚</h2>
<figure id="attachment_64406"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/zx-spec-tdd.gif?h=768" alt="Screenshot showing passing and failing tests." data-recalc-dims="1"/><figcaption>I assert that this is cool.</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you wrote Z80 assembly many years ago, there’s a good chance you didn’t write tests. Test-Driven Development (TDD) wasn’t a thing <span>and our code just worked flawlessly first time</span>. Thankfully, <a href="https://github.com/rhargreaves">@rhargreaves</a> has gifted the world a tool called <a href="https://github.com/rhargreaves/zx-spec">zx-spec</a> that helps by providing a framework for practicing TDD.</p>
<h2>8. Compose chiptune music</h2>

		</p>
<p>@Utz82’s <a href="https://github.com/utz82/ZX-Spectrum-1-Bit-Routines/tree/master/fluidcore">fluidcore</a> is a 4-channel PCM wavetable player for the Spectrum’s beeper. Hardcore, metalcore, and/or mathcore fans will likely not enjoy fluidcore as much as chiptune fans. This <a href="http://randomflux.info/1bit/viewtopic.php?id=21">tutorial</a> outlines the technique used here if you’d like to experiment with it. Admittedly, it’s a bit over my head, but it sounds great! 🤘🏻</p>
<h2>9. “Spectrumize” your images</h2>
<figure id="attachment_64401"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/lee-spectrumized-1.png" alt="Screenshot showing a photographed being transformed into the correct dimensions and colors for display on a Spectrum." srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/lee-spectrumized-1.png?w=812 812w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/lee-spectrumized-1.png?w=300 300w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/lee-spectrumized-1.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px"/><figcaption>My face coming to a loading screen near you.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking for a nice retro avatar for your GitHub or social media account? How about a piece of 8-bit art to hang on your wall? <a href="https://github.com/jarikomppa">@Jarikomppa</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/jarikomppa/img2spec">Image Spectrumizer</a> allows you to convert any of your images to something that looks more at home on your Spectrum’s screen—either through a GUI or the command line. There are also lots of buttons and levers to tweak the settings. This is Windows only though, I’m afraid.</p>
<h2>10. New adventures with Spectrum Next</h2>
<figure id="attachment_64407"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/scapeghost-zx-spectrum-next.png" alt="Screenshot of Scapeghost for the ZX Spectrum Next" srcset="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/scapeghost-zx-spectrum-next.png?w=644 644w, https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/scapeghost-zx-spectrum-next.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"/><figcaption>Scapeghost for ZX Spectrum Next.</figcaption></figure>
<p>After a successful crowdfunding campaign, the <a href="https://www.specnext.com/">ZX Spectrum Next</a> was launched in 2017—a new and updated version, compatible with software and hardware for the original ZX Spectrum, and with additional capabilities. We’re already starting to see new content arrive, for example, <a href="https://github.com/stefanbylund/zxnext_level9/tree/master/compilation">The Level 9 Compilation</a> delivers lots of new text adventure games.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on our <a href="https://github.com/topics/spectrum-next"><code>#spectrum-next</code> topic page</a> and see how the Spectrum Next ecosystem develops.</p>
<p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> Someone’s already written a <a href="https://github.com/remy/next-http">utility to allow the Spectrum to communicate via HTTP</a>. It shouldn’t be too long before we have an amazing 8-bit MMO roguelike or text adventure game 🤞🏻</p>
<p>Well, that’s my ten projects—thanks for reading. Until next time*!</p>
<p><sup>* next time being August this year for the 40th anniversary of the the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64">Commodore 64</a>, and April 2024 for the 40th anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC_464">Amstrad CPC 464</a> of course.</sup></p>
