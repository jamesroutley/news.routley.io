    <h1>Return new Promise( resolve =&gt; {... (RC Reflection)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>There&#39;s a tradition at RC that at the end of a batch, one should write a return statement to reflect on their experience. Since I&#39;m only half way done, I want to return a promise instead.</p>
<p>Before coming to RC, I wondered if it was going to be &#34;transformative.&#34; Some people quoted on the website described it in such terms, and I was curious if I would feel something similar. Spoiler alert: it has not been transformative.</p>
<p>But, it has been healing.</p>
<p>I came from an environment (college) where work was a source of consumptive stress. Failure felt like the end of the world. I cared deeply about what I did -- otherwise I would have been able to slack off -- but my intrinsic love felt swamped by extrinsic fears. Being at RC has felt really freeing; whether an individual project fails or not, the effort I put in is the success.</p>
<p>Much of what I have done thus far has been unexpected. I did not expect to do much JavaScript at RC, or enjoy it as much as I have. Playing around with browser extensions has turned from a deeply confusing mess to something where I can take an idea and turn out partially working code in a day! As part of that, I&#39;ve had fun building my own instincts to build, even outside of coding. My copy and paste extension is just something I <em>want</em>, and I see other areas across my life where I can make little improvements. Not in an &#34;optimizer&#34; way, but in a &#34;I think this room needs a cat door&#34; sort of way.</p>
<p>All of this is good. And useful to say. (Another habit I&#39;ve built at RC is not focusing solely on how a situation is difficult). But as I&#39;m returning a promise, rather than a statement, I think there&#39;s value in reflecting on where I would like to grow further.</p>
<p>Overall, I think I have done a good job at &#34;working at the edge of my abilities.&#34; I&#39;m quite junior; everything is at edge of my abilities! As mentioned above, I feel my &#34;volitional muscles&#34; growing stronger. But, I don&#39;t think I have been as good at &#34;learning generously, <em>or learning from other&#39;s generosity.</em></p>
<p>The most obvious manifestation of this dynamic is pairing. As is common, I wish that I paired more over the first six weeks of my batch. Doing ARENA exercises, I paired quite a bit, but haven&#39;t much with the browser extensions. Outside of ARENA, I&#39;ve probably paired only once or twice a week, and I&#39;d like to do more. The biggest barrier for me has been a scheduling thing; without a set time each day to pair, it always feels like a distraction from the projects that I want to be working on. Maybe I should set up a weekly &#34;pair hour.&#34; Or revive it. Or just find the thing that probably already exists on the calendar.</p>
<p>Another challenge has been how to balance pairing on a) my projects b) the other person&#39;s projects c) things in between. It feels almost selfish to suggest that we work on my project, but perhaps that&#39;s silly. That gives the other person something new to experience, and I think I need to work through that hang-up. I&#39;d like to do a small (weeklong) project with someone as well; I think I&#39;d learn a lot from that.</p>
<p>Pairing is not the only place where I have not been as good of a community member as I would have hoped. I have not done a good job keeping the coffee chats, or reaching out to remote folks. I probably should reduce the number of chats I am paired on in exchange for increasing my attendance. My number of unread direct messages has piled up, and I think that I became a little paralyzed.</p>
<p>I think ARENA has played a role in this. For a couple of weeks, it felt like the only thing that I was working on, and scheduling things outside of that felt difficult. I took the past week and a half off from doing exercise sets, and I&#39;m happy with that decision. But it&#39;s something I&#39;ll reflect on going forwards: what is the best way for me to remain involved with that group while still feeling freeing to float around more?</p>
<p>I have made a conscious decision to not think about jobs, and I think I&#39;ll stick with that. Emotionally, I&#39;m still a little bit uncertain about Epic, but I don&#39;t think it is helpful to dwell on. The most important lesson I can learn from RC is not a particular coding style, but a way of moving through the world. For better or for worse, I don&#39;t think that job-preparations jibe well with developing my inner poise at this moment in time. So I&#39;ll treat RC more like a sabbatical than a wholesome bootcamp. But we shall see. Things could change.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, I promise that I will live the next six weeks generously, and at the edge of my abilities!</p>
