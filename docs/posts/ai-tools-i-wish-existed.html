    <h1>AI tools I wish existed</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It&#39;s September 2025. We have Claude Opus 4.1. GPT-5. Nano banana. There has never been a better time in the history of computing to build software. Here are a few ideas I wish existed.</p><ol><li>A camera app that uses nano banana to make my mediocre iPhone photos look like they were taken on a Leica.</li><li>A single-purpose AI agent that can take any frontend project and automatically add support for light mode, dark mode, and custom theming. It should be able to use vision to see the UI changes, and then iteratively make changes based on the rendered UI.</li><li>Another single-purpose AI agent that can decompile and debug minified code into an interpretable codebase. This also requires a strong code-then-debug loop.</li><li>A hybrid of Strong (the lifting app) and ChatGPT where the model has access to my workouts, can suggest improvements, and coach me. I mainly just want to be able to chat with the model knowing it has detailed context for each of my workouts (down to the time in between each set).</li><li>A recommendation engine that looks at my browsing history, sees what blog posts or articles I spent the most time on, then searches the web every night for things I should be reading that I’m not. In the morning I should get a digest of links. I also want to be able to give feedback on which were good suggestions and which weren’t to improve the next day’s digest.</li><li>A calorie tracking app that’s a chat app grounded by nutrition databases. Just minimize the cognitive effort it takes me to log a meal.</li><li>A minimalist writing app that lets me write long-form content. A model can also highlight passages and leave me comments in the marginalia. I should be able to set different “personas” to review what I wrote.</li><li>An AI agent that can build one-off specialized AI agents. I want to describe a task like “build me an agent that can decompile code” and this agent will go off and build a hyper-specialized code decompilation agent for me.</li><li>A minimalist ebook reader that lets me read ebooks, but I can highlight passages and have the model explain things in more depth off to the side. It should also take on the persona of the author. It should feel like an <em>extension</em> of the book and not a separate chat instance.</li><li>A Deep Research agent that can reason for multiple days. I want to give it <em>very</em> complex queries and let it know it can spawn hundreds of sub-agents and reason for 3 days before it needs to return a response.</li><li>A <em>paint-by-number</em> filmmaking app. I want to be able to brainstorm an idea for a short film in the app, have the model create a detailed storyboard, and then I just need to use my phone to film each of the storyboarded shots. Kind of like training wheels for making movies.</li><li>A local screen recording app but it uses local models to create detailed semantic summaries of what I’m doing each day on my computer. This should then be provided as context for a chat app. I want to ask things like “Who did I forget to respond to yesterday?” I&#39;ve been using Rewind for a year now, and it&#39;s nowhere near as useful as it should be.</li><li>Semantic filters for Twitter/X/YouTube. I want to be able to write open-ended filters like “hide any tweet that will likely make me angry” and never have my feed show me rage-bait again. By shaping our feeds we shape ourselves.</li><li>An agent that can create a detailed curriculum for very niche topics. I should be able to say something like “I want to learn everything we know about the science of progress” and it would search the web for people, blog posts, YouTube videos, essays, and textbooks. Then it should read through all the content, and give me a guided curriculum that will take me from beginner to expert.</li><li>An <em>actually good</em> book recommendation engine that first quizzes you about things you’ve read in the past, what your goals are, and the sort of things you enjoy reading. Then once it knows a lot about you, another agent simulates what you might think of the books the main agent suggests. It only surfaces books that you’re very likely to enjoy.</li><li>A semantic search engine for TikTok and Instagram Reels. There’s so much useful information locked away in short-form videos. I want to be able to query it.</li><li>A sleep fitness app that pulls in data from my Apple Watch (HR, VO₂), Eight Sleep, Oura Ring, workout apps, and combines them to give me practical recommendations for how to improve my sleep and recovery. I want it to proactively message me. Something like <em>“I noticed your HRV has gone down this week, maybe you’re overtraining?”</em></li><li>A massive component library designed to be rendered within the context of a chat interface. Most existing component libraries have primitives that are too low-level. Less customization, more high level widgets.</li><li>A minimal voice assistant for my Apple Watch. I have lots of questions that are too complicated for Siri but not for ChatGPT. The responses should just be a few words long.</li><li>A writing app that searches the web for the topic you’re writing about, then composes a “suggested reading” list based on what it thinks might be helpful for you to read. (Writing apps should never write <em>for</em> you.)</li><li>A running app that creates a personalized plan, tracks your running pace and heart rate, and then iteratively adjusts the training program based on real world data.</li><li>A nano banana photo-editing app where I don’t have to write a prompt. Just give me hundreds of templates from trying out different haircuts to seeing what you and your partner’s kid would look like to making me look like The Rock. A photo editing super-app.</li><li>Same.energy but for finding YouTube videos with similar vibes. Let me put in a URL and have it find similar videos. YouTube&#39;s algorithm today is not this.  It just tries to maximize the median user’s engagement.</li><li>A Sony Walkman-style device that you can give to children so they can ask questions to an LLM. It should be voice-first, and focused on explaining things. There shouldn’t be a single screen on the device. Offline-first would be a plus.</li><li>A search engine for biographies of people where the query is a questionnaire about the current problem you’re facing, your stage in life, your field, etc. The engine’s results should be chapters from biographies or autobiographies from great people throughout history who have gone through and written about similar circumstances.</li><li>A screen-recording agent that observes how I’m using my computer and phone. Each day it audits the content I’ve been consuming. Screen Time is not specific enough. I want to know the exact nutritional value of the tokens I’m consuming.</li><li>A marketplace for AI agents. I don’t think today’s general agents will be better than an agent designed for a specific use case. I want a hyper-specific agent catalog for niche tasks like finding an apartment to rent in San Francisco. There should be tens of thousands of these agents that I can use via the web or call via API.</li><li>A writing app that lets you “request a critique” from a bunch of famous writers. What would Hemingway say about this blog post? What did he find confusing? What did he like?</li></ol><p>If you&#39;re building anything on this list, please let me know. I&#39;d really like to use it.</p></div></div>
