			<p>“When did we begin to be as selfish as we are today?” asks historian Andrea Wulf in her new book <i>Magnificent Rebels: The First Romantics and the Invention of the Self</i>.<a href="#[1]">[1]</a> “At what point did we expect to have the right to determine our own lives? When did we think it was our right to take what we wanted? . . . When did we first ask the question, how can I be free?”</p>
<blockquote><p>As Alexander later recalled, the time in Jena “affected me power­fully.” Goethe changed the way he understood the natural world, moving him from purely empirical research towards an interpretation of nature that combined scientific data with emotional responses. “Nature must be experienced through feeling” . . . Together with a growing emphasis on the subjectivity of the Ich-philosophy, Alexander von Humboldt’s perspective shifted, and almost fifty years later he would write in his international bestseller <i>Cosmos</i> that “the external world only exists for us so far as we receive it within ourselves.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Goethe’s influence on Alexander’s holistic vision of nature is evident; he was to dedicate the first book he published after his return from South America to Goethe. Evident, too, is the presence of Alexander, with his insatiable yearning for knowledge, in <i>Faust</i>, which Goethe recommenced work on, after years of neglecting it, during his time in Jena; as Wulf points out, the pact between Faust and Mephistopheles contains many allusions to Schelling’s <i>Naturphilosophie</i> and Idealism.</p>
<blockquote><p>As the carriage passed through the ancient gate in the town walls, the horses’ iron-shod hooves clanked on the cobblestones and [Dorothea’s] heart raced faster and faster. </p></blockquote>
<p>Says who? Did Wulf find this in Dorothea’s diary or letters? If so, shouldn’t she footnote them?</p>
