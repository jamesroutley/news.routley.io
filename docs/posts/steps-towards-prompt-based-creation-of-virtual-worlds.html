      <span>Abstract:</span>  Large language models trained for code generation can be applied to speaking
virtual worlds into existence (creating virtual worlds). In this work we show
that prompt-based methods can both accelerate in-VR level editing, as well as
can become part of gameplay rather than just part of game development. As an
example, we present Codex VR Pong which shows non-deterministic game mechanics
using generative processes to not only create static content but also
non-trivial interactions between 3D objects. This demonstration naturally leads
to an integral discussion on how one would evaluate and benchmark experiences
created by generative models - as there are no qualitative or quantitative
metrics that apply in these scenarios. We conclude by discussing impending
challenges of AI-assisted co-creation in VR.
