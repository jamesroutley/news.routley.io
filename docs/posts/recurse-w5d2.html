<p>Another check-in about today, and hopefully some catch up since <a href="https://websiteaboutmy.website/blog/recurse-w5d2/recurse-w4d1">the last one</a> as well!</p>
<p>My goal last week was to get the multiplayer project to be robust and recoverable across &#39;lost signals&#39;. It&#39;s not 100% , but it definitely recovers and handles HMR elegantly across many cases, including client and server restarts.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a demo:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a snapshot of <a href="https://github.com/etgrieco/game-ws-multiplayer-experiment/tree/0e3bbd75f50e7454cd0158a945c6da6b3a86c147">where I&#39;m currently at with the project</a></p>
<p>Here are some new things I learned today while adding features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Controls, with <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/leva/">leva</a></li>
<li>An orbital control camera, and other niceties, with <a href="https://github.com/pmndrs/drei">drei</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtzt35QOXmkKkZL63E3IXDxqvP13MHyTE">Followed along with this playlist</a> as inspiration for setting up cameras, flat terrain plains, etc. It&#39;s written in non-React Three.JS, plus taking on the additional challenge of having things work in a multiplayer (server/client) setup.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also went through with a refactor to potentially allow for &gt;2 players, in case a gameplay idea comes out of that. It also gives me some more flexibility in how I handle sending updates from the server; for example, I may only update some players, not all, per-update message send.</p>
<h2 id="looking-back">Looking back --</h2>
<p>Since last week, the major improvements were primarily around the organization of the web socket state machine, both on web and server. It&#39;s still a quite &#39;loose&#39; state machine at this point, and potentially prone to unexpected behaviors. I wanted some flexibility still at this point, but basically I organized my states as follows:</p>
<p>The state of the game, according to the client:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>type</span> <span>GameMachineState</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>{</span>
      name<span>:</span> <span>&#34;INIT&#34;</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>{</span>
      name<span>:</span> <span>&#34;SESSION_CONNECTED_WITH_GAME_PLAYING&#34;</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>{</span>
      name<span>:</span> <span>&#34;SESSION_CONNECTED_WITH_GAME_READY&#34;</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>{</span>
      name<span>:</span> <span>&#34;SESSION_CONNECTED_WITH_GAME_WAITING_PLAYER&#34;</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>&#34;Transitions&#34;/events that can be triggered by the server, and cause changes between these states</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>export</span> <span>type</span> <span>MultiplayerGameStatus</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>&#34;PAUSED_AWAITING_START&#34;</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>&#34;PAUSED_AWAITING_PLAYERS&#34;</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>&#34;PLAYING&#34;</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>which come packaged in updates like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span>{</span>
  type<span>:</span> <span>&#34;GAME_STATUS_UPDATE&#34;</span><span>;</span>
  id<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>
  data<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    sessionId<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>
    gameStatus<span>:</span> MultiplayerGameStatus<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>I should perhaps think on if there&#39;s a mistake here -- is it worth it to unify the state definitions between client and server? That may make things a bit simpler to follow as the application grows.</p>
<p>But that would require another refactor, and may push forward on adding gameplay features instead, and return back to this part as a cleanup later.</p>
