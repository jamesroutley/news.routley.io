<p><span id="more-17139"></span>I have made every member of my family promise not to ever let me enter <em>Masterchef</em> or the <em>Great British Bakeoff</em>. I cannot think of anything worse than to display your inadequacies in front of an audience of several million aspiring chefs who can probably cook better than you. A quiet life in the serenity of a calm kitchen is best, even though it is not always like this in our household.</p>
<p>One thing I would be good at, though, is the invention test. This is when the contestants are faced with an array of ingredients and have to make up a dish. In fact our whole family would be good at it.</p>
<p>Recently I faced the dilemma of having a packet of pork sausages in the fridge but not wanting to eat anything Western. The weather outside was very cold and I really wanted to eat rice.</p>
<p>Being the end of the week the fridge was quite bare. This is what else I had in the fridge: tofu, red chilli, cherry tomatoes and spring onions. On the kitchen counter I had a new bottle of reduced salt miso paste.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is good to challenge yourself to try to make a dish that is new and surprising. This is what I did, by treating the sausage meat as minced pork and adding some seasonings that could complement its savoury taste. The resulting dish was really delicious so I made it again a few days later with mushrooms as a vegan version. The recipe is at the end of the post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Sausage and Tofu Dish:</p>
<p>400 g plain pork sausages, casing removed</p>
<p>400 g block of firm tofu, drained and cut into cubes</p>
<p>50 g shallot, chopped finely</p>
<p>2 cloves of garlic, chopped finely</p>
<p>1 red chilli, deseeded and chopped finely</p>
<p>150 g water</p>
<p>12 cherry tomatoes</p>
<p>2 tablespoons Japanese sake or Korean soju</p>
<p>1 tablespoon reduced-salt miso paste</p>
<p>1/2 tablespoon maple syrup</p>
<p>freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p>1 teaspoon cornflour mixed with 2 tablespoons water</p>
<p>thinly sliced spring onions and sesame seeds for garnishing</p>
<p>sunflower oil</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Make:</p>
<p>Heat a small amount of oil in a pan and fry the sausages, breaking up the lumps with a flat wooden spatula.</p>
<p>Add the shallot, garlic and chilli, continuing to fry until the sausage meat is browned and cooked through.</p>
<p>Add the sake or soju and fry until the liquid has been absorbed into the meat.</p>
<p>Add the miso paste, maple syrup and black pepper. Give everything a good stir and fry for 1 minute.</p>
<p>Add the water, cover the pot and leave this simmering over a low heat whilst you fry the tofu.</p>
<p>Heat a small amount of oil in a separate small non-stick pan. Fry the tofu until browned on one side, then gently flip over and brown the other side.</p>
<p>Uncover the pot and gently stir in the fried tofu, cherry tomatoes and cornflour mixed with water.</p>
<p>Simmer uncovered for around 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Sprinkle over the chopped spring onion and sesame seeds before serving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Why we need heat: transforming pale and anaemic tofu into a golden brown crisped up version of itself&#8230;like getting a suntan</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I served the tofu dish with rice steamed with quinoa: wash the rice as usual and to one cup of rice add one tablespoon of quinoa. Steam in the rice cooker as usual.</p>

<p>Here is the vegan version with mushrooms which we had for dinner last night. We had friends over so I did not take a photo, but the result was very good. There is a slight variation in ingredients and method so please read carefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Mushroom and Tofu Dish:</p>
<p>400 g mixed wild mushrooms, sliced</p>
<p>400 g block of firm tofu, drained and cut into cubes</p>
<p>100 g sugar snap peas</p>
<p>50 g shallot, chopped finely</p>
<p>2 cloves of garlic, chopped finely</p>
<p>1 red chilli, deseeded and chopped finely</p>
<p>2 tablespoons Japanese sake or Korean soju</p>
<p>1 tablespoon regular miso paste</p>
<p>1/2 tablespoon maple syrup</p>
<p>freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p>thinly sliced spring onions and sesame seeds for garnishing</p>
<p>sunflower oil</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Make:</p>
<p>Start by frying the tofu. Heat a small amount of oil in a small non-stick pan. Fry the tofu until browned on one side, then gently flip over and brown the other side. Keep aside.</p>
<p>Heat a small amount of oil in a separate pan and fry the shallot, garlic and chilli for around a minute, then add in the sliced mushrooms.</p>
<p>Continuing to stir fry until the mushrooms have softened a little.</p>
<p>Add the sake or soju, miso paste, maple syrup and black pepper. Give everything a good stir then add the fried tofu.</p>
<p>Cover the pot and leave this simmering over a low heat for around five minutes. The liquid from the mushrooms will infuse the tofu with a savoury flavour (you know, what chefs like to call <em>umami</em>).</p>
<p>Uncover the pot and gently stir in the sugar snap peas. Leave to simmer for one minute only so as not to overcook the peas.</p>
<p>Sprinkle over the chopped spring onion and sesame seeds before serving.</p>
