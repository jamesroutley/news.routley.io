    <p>I had a dream last night I went to work at Amazon. Joining the Bezos neofeudal empire. This post is directed at anyone with talent who works at a tech company ushering in this future.</p>

<hr/>


<p>Have you thought about how this is going to play out? I understand you may be at a place where you are insecure about money, and that insecurity is what drives you. But why do you think having more money will fix that insecurity?</p>

<p>In the future, when labor is fully marginalized and capital is the only force, you will not be able to afford GPT$$$ (it’s $1B per month), only the billionaires will. GPT$$$ is surely smart enough to separate you from whatever you have, be that with targeting advertising, a scam you fall for, or lobbying your government to take it from you.</p>

<p>A pile of money will buy you nothing in the neofeudal world.</p>

<hr/>


<p>Historically, there has been some loyalty to the subjects of a feudal empire because labor had some value. You needed the peasants to grow the grain so you could tax it and take it and have leverage over others by having grain to offer them. When the grain is produced by machines, the peasants are cut out of the loop.</p>

<p>The solution to this is not to accumulate grain, buy shares in a granary, or anything else like that. They will find a way to make whatever you have worthless. Because the feudal world didn’t operate on capitalist principles, and neither will the neofeudal world.</p>

<hr/>


<p>If you work at a large company, if you work according to the principles of modern capitalism, where all the fish will be eaten by the bigger fish, and all will be eaten by the sharks, and all the sharks will be eaten by bigger sharks, you are actively bringing about the system that will kill you.</p>

<p><b>Have you considered not participating?</b> If you participate, we all lose. We will either all be in the underclass together or not.</p>
