    <h1>Human shielding and how things impact a person</h1>
    
    
<p>
In reading some of the news today, I got to thinking about my own 
experiences at big companies, and then started wondering how much I had 
written about a certain topic.  I went looking through the now-decade of 
posts here, and somehow, I&#39;ve never talked about &#34;padding&#34;.  I mean, 
sure, the word itself comes up, but that&#39;s when talking about padding 
out meeting times, jamming a C-64 into a suitcase, or sticking spaces 
or zeroes in front of some number.
</p>
<p>
No, this kind of padding is the personal, emotional kind.  You might 
call it shielding, or energy, or a &#34;buffer&#34;, or &#34;spoons&#34;, even.  I don&#39;t 
think the name matters much.  It&#39;s more about the concept.
</p>
<p>
For me, it goes something like this: if things are generally okay in my 
life, then I start the day with some amount of padding.  If something 
happens, that impacts the padding.  If there&#39;s enough padding, it ends 
up being a mild inconvenience at worst.  For instance, this time last 
week when I had my
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/08/18/infra/">flat tire</a>
at 75 mph, I was in a pretty good place to handle it.  I just pulled off 
the road and got to work doing what I knew needed to be done - crack 
the lug nuts, jack up the car, remove the bad wheel, put on the spare, 
and so on.
</p>
<p>
Now, if the same thing had happened a couple of years earlier, I might 
not have had things together so well.  I might have just pulled off the 
road and wept for a while until eventually figuring that I should call 
someone to save my bacon.  The car would have still needed the same 
service, but I wouldn&#39;t have been so fast to just jump out on the side 
of the road and start getting greasy.
</p>
<p>
What&#39;s the difference?  That&#39;s where my so-called &#34;padding&#34; comes in.
Nothing too interesting has been weighing on me, so I can just deal with 
it.  A dumb thing like a road eating my tire turns into a few wasted 
hours in some one-horse town and a few hundred dollars gone.  I can 
handle that, and so life goes on.
</p>
<p>
Stuff like this is why I have to remind some people that &#34;we don&#39;t all 
start from the same place every morning&#34;.  Different personalities, 
different comfort levels, and all sorts of other dimensions come into 
play.
</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s try a little thought experiment here.
</p>
<p>
Say I have $1000 cash in my purse.  Don&#39;t ask why, I just do on this 
day.  I don&#39;t have any particular use for it, so it&#39;s just there.  I&#39;m 
driving through the middle of nowhere and I blow a tire.  I drag my car 
into the nearest service station and - surprise - I can get it fixed, 
since I can just throw money at them until they make it go away.  I can 
probably even pay for a ridiculously long tow if I feel like it.  Maybe 
I can have the car towed back to California while I hop a plane back 
home.  Whatever.
</p>
<p>
Now imagine me at another point in my life when I have no cash on 
hand, and my credit cards are pushing their limits.  I&#39;m driving along 
and hit the same hole and blow a tire just the same.  The car gets 
dragged to the same spot, but now it&#39;s not going to be a certain thing 
that I get help and continue on my way.  It&#39;ll mostly be through 
the kindness and generosity of whoever is out there on that day.  Maybe 
I can get them to patch it up even though they don&#39;t advise it.  Maybe I 
can promise to mail them a check when I get home.
</p>
<p>
Same person, different resources, different impact, different outcome.
</p>
<p>
I just need people to realize that just like money can make a situation 
&#34;no big deal&#34; or &#34;end of the world&#34;, there are other, less-visible 
dimensions in the human sphere which can do the same thing.
