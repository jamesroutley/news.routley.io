<p>CUPERTINO, Calif.—After years of speculation, leaks, rumors, setbacks, and rumblings of amazing behind-the-scenes demos, Apple has made its plans for a mixed reality platform and headset public. Vision Pro is &#34;the first Apple Product you look through, not at,&#34; Apple&#39;s Tim Cook said, a &#34;new AR platform with a new product&#34; that augments reality by seamlessly blending the real world with the digital world.</p>
<p>The headset will start at $3,499 and be available early next year. That puts the device in an entirely different class than most existing VR headsets, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/psvr2-review-plenty-of-improvements-but-is-it-too-little-too-late/">the $550 PSVR2</a> (which requires a tethered PS5 to use) and the $500 Quest 3 that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/meta-beats-apple-to-the-mixed-reality-punch-with-499-quest-3-coming-this-fall/">just announced for a fall release</a>.</p>

<p>&#34;I believe augmented reality is a profound technology. Blending digital content with the real world can unlock new experiences,&#34; Cook said.</p>
<p>The headset, which looks like a pair of shiny ski goggles, has a lightweight aluminum frame with a single piece of glass on the front that acts as a lens for a wide array of cameras. A single button lets you capture videos, while a &#34;digital crown&#34; lets you tune how much of outside reality is filtered out at any time.</p>
<p>The Vision Pro&#39;s MicroOLED backplane packs 23 million pixels across two panels &#34;the size of a postage stamp.&#34; A three-element lens delivers that image at the proper depth &#34;everywhere you look,&#34; Apple said, and allows for true 4K HDR video that can show fine text that looks sharp &#34;from any angle.&#34;</p>

<p>The headset is powered by an M2 chip combined with support from a new chip called R1. These chips process inputs from 12 different cameras, five sensors (included a LiDAR scanner), and six different microphones. Apple said that while the M2 &#34;ensures performance,&#34; the R1 &#34;virtually eliminates lag&#34; and delivers images to the displays within 12ms, ensuring experiences &#34;feel like they&#39;re taking place in front of your eyes.&#34;</p>

<p>For weight purposes, an external battery will sit in your pocket and connect to the Vision Pro through a cable that attaches to the headstrap near the temple. Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/">product web site</a> says that battery can support &#34;up to 2 hours of use,&#34; or all-day use while plugged in to a wall outlet.</p>
<p>A number of &#34;soft textile parts&#34; are part of a modular system that flexes to the form of your face, with a flexible band that incorporates ear pods for sound. Custom inserts from Zeiss will allow for vision correction for those who wear glasses.</p>
<p>The headset&#39;s visionOS operating system can be controlled in a &#34;fully 3D interface&#34; without a handheld controller. It solely uses your eyes, hands, and voice as an interface, and the unit lets you &#34;control the system simply by looking.&#34; Icons and other UI elements react to your gaze, and you use natural gestures like tapping your fingers or a gentle flick to select them—no need to hold your hands awkwardly in front of you constantly.</p>

<p>Existing iOS developer frameworks have been extended into the visionOS environment to offer support for what Apple is calling &#34;spatial computing.&#34; That means &#34;hundreds of thousands&#34; of existing iPad and iOS apps will work on Vision Pro at launch. Apple promises that developers will be able to create 3D objects that &#34;look and feel real&#34; in their visionOS apps. A new app store will include custom Vision Pro apps as well as compatible iOS apps.</p>

<p>A user&#39;s encrypted, on-device &#34;Optic ID&#34; is used to unlock the Vision Pro and power things like Apple Pay and password autofill. Camera data and information about your eye input is kept in a separate background process, ensuring that apps and websites can&#39;t know where you&#39;re looking.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In video demonstrations, Apple showed users walking around and grabbing things from a fridge without taking the headset off. And to further keep you from feeling isolated while wearing the headset, a system called EyeSight will display your eyes when someone is nearby, conveying &#34;a critical indicator of connection and emotion.&#34;</p>

<p>Floating 2D apps can be placed to float around your &#34;real world&#34; space, which remains visible through the semi-transparent display. Elements in this interface will cast shadows in the real room around them and respond to light, Apple said. These apps can also &#34;expand fully into your space,&#34; like a pulsating 3D animation in a mindfulness app.</p>
<p>A floating 4K Mac display will appear when users glance at their MacBook display while in the Vision Pro. From there, users can interact with a virtual keyboard or their voice to type or make use of a physical Magic Trackpad and/or Magic Keyboard.</p>
<p>While watching movies (including 3D movies) on a virtual floating screen, the device will automatically dim your surroundings to be less distracting. The headset can take spatial photos or videos via &#34;Apple&#39;s first three-dimensional camera&#34; with the click of a button. You can then re-experience those 3D panoramas in a way that creates &#34;the sensation they are standing right where it was taken.&#34;</p>

<p>Disney CEO Bob Iger came out to demonstrate a number of customized Vision Pro experiences, from Disney+ support to ESPN sports broadcasts with a wide array of stats filling your room to a virtual Mickey Mouse that walks around your space.</p>
<p>Disney+ support will be available on day one, alongside over 100 Apple Arcade titles that will be available to play via a floating screen and a handheld controller on the device.</p>
