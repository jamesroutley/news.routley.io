<p>Monster Energy markets itself as a drink for gamers. You&#39;ve surely noticed it as a sponsor for various events, and even placed within some games – <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-removes-monster-energy/">most notably, Death Stranding</a>. However, despite its outwardly image of a brand for gamers, Monster Energy doesn&#39;t really seem to like video game developers. The energy drink is once again going after a developer for using the word &#39;Monster&#39; in its game title.</p>

 <!-- No winning ad found for zone: below first paragraph! --><!-- No winning ad found for zone: mid intro! --> 
<p>The last time something like this happened was in 2020, when the beverage brand <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/gods-and-monsters-immortals-fenix-rising-monster-energy/">clashed with Ubisoft over the name Gods and Monsters</a> – the original name for <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tag/immortals-fenix-rising/">Immortals Fenix Rising</a>. At the time, Monster claimed that the trademark was too similar and would confuse users. Of course, we wouldn&#39;t want someone to eat a game disc or pour a drink into their console out of confusion. </p>

<p>This time, Monster Energy has decided to flex its muscle at indie developer Glowstick Entertainment, which has made a game called <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=f7b3f4f436eeb21561fd86fbd1d7ab08&amp;cuid=UUtgUeUpU2053627&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1266690%2FDark_Deception_Monsters__Mortals%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow">Dark Deception: Monsters &amp; Mortals</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/VincentLivings/status/1641206007077691392">According to founder and CEO Vincent Livings</a>, the overreaching settlement terms sent to Glowstick state that in exchange for being allowed to use the current name, the studio will have to refrain from naming any other game with a variation of the word &#39;Monster&#39;.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"adPosition":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":10,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"actualCount":510} -->
<p>Livings has decided to fight the case, rather than give in to Monster Energy&#39;s demands. Additionally, he also Tweeted saying that he will share everything he receives from Monster&#39;s lawyers so that other devs who get harassed by them will know their tactics.</p>
<!-- No repeatable ad for zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- Repeatable debug data: {"adPosition":1,"skipEvery":null,"nbrPlacementFilledEachSkip":1,"nbrPlacementsScanned":11,"ruleCount":1000,"degradationStartingPoint":1,"actualCount":776} -->

<p>&#34;It also forces us to agree to never use a green &amp; white logo on a black background for any game we ever make. So they own the colors green &amp; white too apparently,&#34; Livings Tweeted, revealing more of the brand&#39;s demands. </p>
<!-- Zone: character count repeatable. --><!-- No ads allowed! -->
<p>&#34;Any logo that has a monster style font will be deemed confusingly similar to Monster Energy&#39;s logo. It demands that we never use one for any future games. This means they could demand that we change Dark Deception&#39;s logo as well. It can be applied broadly.&#34; By agreeing to these terms, Dark Deception: Monsters &amp; Mortals could never have a sequel with the word &#39;Monster&#39; in it. </p>
