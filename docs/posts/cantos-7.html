    <h1>Cantos 7</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Truth be told I kept forgetting what canto I was at – and I delayed at making known this uncertain situation. </p>



<p>Eleanor and two other e-words in ancient greek – epsilon.  Why are the marble columns false? The marble is false – not the columns – or the entire structure. How is it a theater set? Is it a tromp l’oil, a veneer, a painting,  paintings an illusion sometimes. Painting is anti matter – it is decomposed matter -pulverised matter and then cooked into something else – paint – to create an illusion of something else- when it is just rock dust on a flat surface. I have been thinking painting is about geometry, and now, topology. But perhaps painting is really about geology and chemistry and cooking. </p>



<p>Cantos 7 and 8 is about none of these things. We start with the ancients – Homer, Ovid, Dante (less ancient), we move from mythic storytellers to an empty home with ghosts. A friend says I have a ghost- that I am haunted – I have a Dybbuk. Hauntology is a new field of philosophy invented by Derrida. </p>



<p>There are no sounds in this house, no knockers on the door, no story tellers. There are lots of images though – a lintel – a low ceiling – four chairs -a cloth sunk top “The scarlet curtan throws a less scarlet shadow,” This sentence makes no sense, but s-es, the sibilene sneak. “And her moving heIght went before me,”  I love this image – moving height. heavy height static flight, tall hole, heavy hole, moving cavern, moving castle. I love sentences that start with AND -when there are a few of them – and when they are written by a famous poet. “Words lIke the locust-shells, moved by no inner being,” “Square even shoulders and the satin skin,”</p>



<p>I read “Lies heavy in my arms, dead weight” It copies as “LIes heavy m my arms, dead we1ght” I misread it as “Legs heavy in my arms, right wraith.” “mooning” mooming mooing booming mawing yawning beijing because we have random injections of china. </p>



<p>“LIfe to make mock of motIon For the husks, before me, move,” This makes me sad – is it always true? No </p>



<p>And this is me</p>



<p>“Eternal watcher of things, Of things, of men, of paSSIOns Eyes floating in dry, dark alr,”</p>



<p>Eternal watcher of air, atmosphere floating leaves and branches and still shadows </p>



<p>This canto feels like a lacuna a cesura a pause a silence a rest so I am going to stop. I was going to read Cantos 7 and 8 but I Can-not (get it) I only am doing 7.</p>
