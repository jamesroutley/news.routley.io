    <h1>Networking FreeDOS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Client ran DOS, OS/2 or Macintosh as OS and used a client software
    like &#34;LAN Manager client&#34; or &#34;MS Client&#34; for the connection to the
  server.


<p>With the &#34;Server Message Block&#34; (SMB) protocol merged into LAN Manager
since 1991, Microsoft networks became able to do <b>peer-to-peer
networking</b> as well. This was used by Windows for Workgroups 3.11,
released in 1993. The mechanism is known to Windows users as &#34;Windows share&#34;,
&#34;network neighbourhood&#34; or &#34;Workgroup&#34;.

<a href="http://www.winhistory.de/more/sammlung.htm"><img alt="Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS" src="http://wisdomtree.info/dos/workgroup-addon.png"/></a>

</p><p>In October 1993 Microsoft released a tool called &#34;Microsoft Workgroup
Add-On for DOS&#34; which allowed to have the same peer-to-peer networking
possibilities in DOS. While the tool itself is not sold any longer, most of
its functionally is still available by usage of &#34;MS Client&#34; and a special
update called &#34;<code>WG1049</code>&#34; (see <a href="#Microsoft">MS Client
section</a>).

</p><h4><a name="L48323">&#34;UNIX centric&#34; approach</a></h4>

<h5>PC-IP</h5>
A small TCP/IP implementation that was
linked into a few applications like finger, whois and netwatch. PC-IP was
released with its source into the public domain. Drew Perkins from Carnegie
Mellon University (CMU) and Dan Lanciani from Harvard University improved the
code further. PC-IP still can be found in <a href="http://members.aol.com/Karima4483/pcip/">the</a> <a href="ftp://ftp.kuzbass.ru/pub/networks/tcpip/tool/pcip.zip">web.</a>

<h5>PC/TCP</h5>
The success of PC-IP inspired Romkey and friends to take the CMU version
of the code and develop it into a proprietary product: &#34;PC/TCP&#34;, which they
sold through their company <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP_Software">&#34;FTP Software, Inc.&#34;</a>,
founded in 1986. The name was chosen after the popular &#39;File Transfer
Protocol&#39;: PC/TCP included one of the first applications for FTP services on
the PC.

<h5>Packet Drivers</h5>

Along with PC/TCP, FTP Software Inc. developed the &#34;<a href="http://www.crynwr.com/packet_driver.html">Packet Driver
Specification</a>&#34;, the first multiprotocol driver specification for PC
network interface cards. On 12 Dec 1988 this specification was released as an
open standard, for anyone to implement.
Packet drivers proved useful to hardware vendors and software developers
alike. Most of the public-domain or shareware TCP/IP applications have been
written to interface with packet drivers only.

<p>Many packet drivers were written or managed by Russ Nelson at Clarkson
University, who became known as the &#34;Packet Driver King&#34; - a story, he <a href="http://russnelson.com/bio.html">describes</a> at his website. Nelson
still distributes these drivers as free software through the site of his
company &#34;<a href="http://www.crynwr.com/">Crynwr</a>&#34; (which was named after
the welsh word for &#34;Quaker&#34;, his religious belief).

</p><p>One cause for the success of FTP Software&#39;s PC/TCP was this open packet
driver interface, which made it easy to develop drivers and applications.
When other driver interfaces like ODI and NDIS appeared on the scene, PC/TCP
included converters: With a tool called <code>ODIPKT.COM</code> ODI drivers
became usable as packet drivers, a tool called <code>DIS_PKT.GUP</code> did
the same for NDIS drivers.

</p><p>PC/TCP also came with an external TCP/IP kernel called
<code>ETHDRV.EXE</code> that allowed other programmers to call network
functions within their applications without programming them themselves. All
these features and an application suite that allowed DOS computers to access
or provide TCP/IP services such as news, e-mail, ftp, telnet or network
storage (PC/TCP even included a NFS client called InterDrive) made FTP
Software Inc. market leader for DOS TCP/IP software.

</p><h4><a name="Software">Software by universities and hobbyists</a></h4><a name="Software">

<p>PC-IP and its successor PC/TCP may have been the first or most successful
TCP/IP kernels for DOS but they were not the only ones.

</p><h5>KA9Q</h5>
Second after the early PC-IP kernel was the &#34;</a><a href="http://www.ka9q.net/code/ka9qnos/">&#34;KA9Q Network Operating System&#34;
(NOS)</a>&#34; by Phil Karn in 1985. Karn, an engineer from Baltimore, Maryland
had created it for CP/M two years before and then ported it to DOS. It also
was one of the first TCP/IP applications for DOS that used FTP Software&#39;s
packet driver specification.
KA9Q simultaneously acted as an Internet client, a server and an IP packet
router. The program was specialized for amateur packet radio, but also could
be used f.i. as ftp- or webserver. KA9Q attracted many contributors. As Karn
<a href="http://www.ka9q.net/code/ka9qnos/">describes</a>: &#34;It was the Linux
of its day&#34;.

<p>In 2002 KA9Q became free software (GNU GPL). Its descendants, <a href="http://www.langelaar.net/projects/jnos2/">JNOS</a> and <a href="http://eznos.knevel.info/index.php">EZ-NOS</a> (see also <a href="http://www.hippy.freeserve.co.uk/eznos.htm">here</a> and <a href="http://www.dossolutions.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/eznos.htm">here</a>) are
still actively maintained.

</p><h5>NCSA Telnet</h5>
Based on the Packet Driver Specification several universities wrote TCP/IP
applications and utilities for DOS PCs. In 1986 the &#34;National Center for
Supercomputing Applications&#34; (NCSA) at the University of lllinois released
&#34;<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/.vol/1/applic/NCSA_Telnet/PC/tel2308b.zip">Telnet</a>&#34;
- a client for UNIX telnet services which could act as FTP and rcp server as
well. It was accompanied by TCP/IP tools like finger, whois and lpr. NCSA
Telnet came with its own TCP/IP kernel, which was already built-in into the
applications. The software was developed until 1995 (v2.308) and released
with <a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/.vol/1/applic/NCSA_Telnet/PC/tel2308s.zip">source</a>
into the public domain.

<h5>CUTCP</h5>
Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York took version 2.2 of NCSA
Telnet and modified it. They called their version CUTE or CUTCP. Eventually
Rutgers University, New Jersey took over the maintenance and published the
latest <a href="ftp://ftp.cc.umanitoba.ca/software/pc_network/cutcp-b.zip">release</a>
in July 1993. In difference to NCSA Telnet, CUTCP supported the IBM-3270
emulation and was technically improved. It also became public domain.

<h5>Others</h5>
<b>Minuet Version 1.0 Beta 18A</b>
</div><div>Network Driver Interface Specification (<b>NDIS</b>) drivers, developed
    by Microsoft and 3Com.

<p>All are <i>multiprotocol</i> network drivers, meaning they
are able to support multiple protocols over the same card. Earlier drivers
did support only a single protocol. Multiprotocol drivers communicate
directly with the network interface card and provide a published interface
specification, to which applications can be written.

Good general introduction <a href="http://www.eits.uga.edu/%7Eucns/lans/docs/netdrive.html">&#34;Implementing
Multi-Protocol Network Drivers in a DOS Environment&#34;</a> by the University of
Georgia, Athens, Georgia (U.S.).

</p><h5>Protocols</h5>
The following protocols are supported by these three drivers:
<ul>
  <li>Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (<b>TCP/IP</b>) used
by the internet,
  </li><li>Internet Packet Exchange / Sequenced Packet Exchange (<b>IPX/SPX</b>)
protocols, used by Novell NetWare,
</li><li>Network Basic Input Output System (NetBIOS) Extended User Interface
<b>(NetBEUI</b>) protocol used by OS/2, Windows 9x, ME and 2000.
</li></ul>

<p>TCP/IP has become the default protocol for Local Area Networks (LAN).
</p><h5>Applications</h5>
Three ways of networking used with DOS.
<ul>
<li>ODI driver based <strong>Novell NetWare</strong>
programs around for accessing a NetWare network and using TCP/IP services.
  </li><li>NDIS driver based <strong>Microsoft &#34;LAN Manager Client&#34; or &#34;MS Client
    3.0&#34;</strong> are supposed to integrate DOS machines into a Windows / SMB
    workgroup.
  </li><li>Packet driver based &#34;UNIX-like&#34; <strong>TCP/IP applications</strong>
 can be used to access or provide network services.
</li></ul>

<p>While the above categories should cover most programs, there are a few
exceptions. One of them is &#34;<a href="http://www.invisiblesoft.com/invlan/index.shtml">Invisible LAN</a>&#34;, a
NetWare-like DOS application that even comes with an own protocol called
&#34;TransBIOS&#34;.
Another special type of applications are network bootdisks, which are able
to work with a broad range of hardware and use multiple protocols. Bootdisks
are mostly used for backup, restore and repair. They can be extremely
helpful.

Excellent <a href="http://www.jacco2.dds.nl/samba/dos.html">review,
    installation report and comparison</a> of both Microsoft products
 by Dutch programmer Jacco de Leeuw.
Ken from British website &#34;DOS Solutions&#34; gives a detailed <a href="http://www.dossolutions.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/network.htm#tcp">overview</a>
    over many resources related to MS Client .
U.S. programmer Jonathan Young has created a nice looking MS Client <a href="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~joyoung/msnetclnt/Page1.shtml">installation
    walkthrough</a> with many screenshots. James Hatridge wrote a nice <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5837">article</a> about MS
    Client for Linux Journal in 2002.
Installation guides in German language have been written by <a href="http://medien.bildung.hessen.de/support/techhilf/msclient/#cl10">Volker
    Rüddigkeit</a>, by <a href="http://www.comp-o-ass.de/dokumente/ms-dos-client.pdf">Gerhard
    Zeiser</a>, by <a href="http://www.gerd-roethig.de/dosnet.html">Gerd
    Röthig</a>, by <a href="http://home.arcor.de/michael-vogl/tcpip-fd.htm">Michael Vogl</a>
    and by <a href="http://de.wikibooks.org/wiki/FreeDOS-Kompendium:_Konfiguration:_Netzwerk">Stefan
    Mayrhofer</a>.

<p>Popularity of the thirteen year old MS Client 3.0 may be caused by
the possibility (but not officially supported) to use an update
called &#34;<code><a href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/softlib/mslfiles/wg1049.exe">WG1049.EXE</a></code>&#34;
to add server functionality to the client. This adds features
comparable to those of the &#34;Workgroup Add-On for DOS&#34;, no longer
sold by Microsoft.

</p><p>This &#34;hack&#34; seems to give people hope to be able to integrate their DOS
machine into a modern Windows XP or GNU/Linux SMB Workgroup. There may be
limits, though.

</p><p>Steven Baker critically <a href="http://www.ece.ubc.ca/~gillies/9802net.html">remarks</a>, that, while
the core TCP/IP protocol remained stable over the years, Microsoft&#39;s SMB
protocols changed from upgrade to upgrade and exist &#34;in a dozen different
dialects&#34;. So compatibility is an issue. Other problems can be caused by the
authentication methods that are used with Windows or Samba.
Some files from the &#34;MS Client&#34; package are essential for use of TCP/IP applications over
today&#39;s common NDIS drivers.

</p><h4>TCP/IP applications</h4>

DOS TCP/IP applications include classic networking tools as ping, lpr or
finger as well as SSH and NFS clients, FTP servers, webservers, mail and news
software or web browsers. There is even a complete peer-to-peer networking
solution called <a href="http://ftp.carnet.hr/pub/pc/networking/NeOS/README">&#34;Network Enhanced
Operating System&#34;</a> (NeOS) which was developed 1995-2000 as <a href="http://www.eureka.be/inaction/AcShowProject.do;jsessionid=7f00000122b839cfc1d1a5c44d359913f31b02769f2f?id=1317">part</a>
of European Union&#39;s &#34;EUREKA&#34; project. Now it is postcardware.

<p>Michael Bernardi has collected a <a href="http://www.dendarii.co.uk/FAQs/dos-apps.html">list of more than hundred
TCP/IP applications</a> available for DOS. There also other lists <a href="ftp://ftp.technion.ac.il/pub/supported/pc/comm/drivers/pkt_drv/doc/software.doc">here</a>,

Polak <a href="http://home.arachne.cz/archive/v01.n1917">decided</a> to make
Arachne free software. The new license is the GNU GPL.
It supports various picture formats. Tables and frames are shown
correctly, it renders HTML 4 and CSS 1.0 and the latest version (1.90J3) even
understands UTF-8. Other Arachne services include FTP, NNTP, IRC-Chat, RSS,
POP3 and SMTP. Look here for a complete <a href="http://www.cisnet.com/glennmcc/ara-gpl/history.txt">history</a> of the

</p><p>&#34;<strong>SSH2DOS</strong>&#34; is a SSH, SFTP and SCP client for DOS. These
services more and more replace the classic telnet- and FTP-services, which
are regarded as less secure. (The screenshot shows a closed SSH session to my
Debian server.)
SSH2DOS was created by Hungarian developer Nagy Daniel in 2000 and can be
downloaded at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sshdos">Sourceforge.net</a>. It is
released under the GNU GPL. It uses code of the PuTTY SSH client as well as
the WatTCP kernel library.

</p><h3>3. Practical Guide: Adding TCP/IP to DOS</h3>

The majority of TCP/IP applications for DOS uses the packet driver
interface. So to be able to run them, we need to install the appropriate
drivers first.
To install a generic packet driver is the simplest way. But it isn&#39;t
always possible, as modern network cards often only come with ODI- and
NDIS-drivers. Anyway: ODI- or NDIS-drivers can also be used as packet drivers
through special converters (&#34;shims&#34;).

<h4><a name="Packet1">Packet drivers</a></h4>
Packet drivers work as an interface between the hardware (the network
interface card) and the TCP/IP kernel (which is also called &#34;protocol
stack&#34;). One sort of TCP/IP kernels work as an external program that can be
called and used by various network applications. Other TCP/IP kernels are
already built into network applications, a web browser for instance or a
ftp-client. We will learn more about these kernels a <a href="#Kernel">bit
further</a> in this document.

<p>As already mentioned, packet drivers are multiprotocol drivers so TCP/IP
isn&#39;t the only kernel that can work atop of it. As you can see in the figure
above, it is also possible to run Novell NetWare over of a packet driver:
Specialized drivers like <code>IPXPD.COM</code> or <code>PDIPX.COM</code>
support IPX over the packet driver interface. The NetBEUI protocol can&#39;t be
used on top of a packet driver though, as the packet driver interface is too
different from NDIS.

</p><p>The first place to look for a packet driver should be the installation
medium that came with your card. Packet drivers often have the letters
&#34;<code>PD</code>&#34; in their names, so the packet driver of a 3com 3C589
PC-Card is called &#34;<code>3C589PD.COM</code>&#34; and the driver of the D-Link
DFE-670TXD PC-Card is called &#34;<code>DFE670PD.COM</code>&#34;. Look for a
directory &#34;<code>PKTDRV</code>&#34; on the CD or floppy that came with your
card.

</p><p>For ISA and PCI network cards a packet driver may be found at Russell Nelson&#39;s <a href="http://www.crynwr.com/">Crynwr</a> project - a resource of public
domain packet drivers. PCMCIA drivers seem to be rare there, though.

</p><p>Georg Potthast provides a <a href="http://www.georgpotthast.de/sioux/packet.htm">collection</a> of PCI
card packet drivers and a tool called <a href="http://www.georgpotthast.de/sioux/pktdrv/nicscan.zip"><code>NICSCAN.EXE</code></a>
to determine the chipset of PCI network cards. He found that
packet drivers are often the same for many models by the same
manufacturer; recommends finding a packet driver by chipset.

</p><h4>Installing a packet driver</h4>
To install a packet driver, add a line to
<code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> (example for 3c589 PCMCIA card):
<pre>LH 3C589PD.COM 0x60 5 0x300</pre>

In the example above the driver is loaded into high memory by using the
command &#34;<code>LH</code>&#34;. The first option (&#34;<code>0x60</code>&#34;) sets the
software interrupt (vector) used by the driver. The most frequently used
packet driver software interrupt number is 0x60. The second option
(&#34;<code>5</code>&#34;) sets the IRQ, the third option (&#34;<code>0x300</code>&#34;) sets
the I/O port. Some drivers only need the vector and find the other values by
themselves. Most packet drivers can be unloaded after use with the option
&#34;<code>-u</code>&#34;.

<p>That&#39;s all. After successfully installing a packet driver, you can skip
the next two steps (ODI / NDIS drivers) and proceed with the TCP/IP
kernel.

</p><h4><a name="drivers">ODI drivers</a></h4>

&#34;Open Datalink Interface&#34; (ODI) drivers were originally needed for Novell
NetWare. But that doesn&#39;t mean they can not be used for packet-driver-based
TCP/IP applications. In fact, they were used for this since they were
invented.
An ODI driver is a good choice, if you cannot get a packet driver.
Look for a directory called &#34;<code>netware</code>&#34;,
&#34;<code>nwclient</code>&#34;, &#34;<code>ODI</code>&#34; or &#34;<code>VLM</code>&#34; on the
installation floppy or CD-ROM. The drivers are executables,
their names look like &#34;<code>3C574.COM</code>&#34; or
&#34;<code>DFE670.COM</code>&#34;.

<p>In the language of the <a href="http://developer.novell.com/ndk/doc/lancomp/dos_psta/dos_pstack.pdf">ODI
specification</a> these drivers of the network card are called <b>&#34;Multiple
Link Interface Driver&#34; (MLID)</b>.
The MLID communicates directly with the
hardware of the network interface card. The MLID receives packets for
different protocol stacks (kernels) in the system and passes these packets to
a second piece of software, the <b>&#34;Link Support Layer&#34; (LSL)</b>. The LSL
then determines which protocol stack is to receive the packet. Both, MLID and
LSL form the ODI architecture.

</p><p>Need an additional file to get ODI working: The LSL, which is a file
called &#34;<code>LSL.COM</code>&#34;. This file is part of the &#34;DOS NetWare Client&#34;,
which can be <a href="http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tools/downloads/dw271e.zip">downloaded</a>
at Novell. Novell&#39;s <a href="http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/tools/13555.html">download site</a>
explicitly remarks &#34;LICENSE: FREE&#34; for it. After download and extraction, the
file &#34;<code>LSL.COM</code>&#34; can be found in the folder
&#34;<code>NIOS</code>&#34;.
To use ODI with packet driver based TCP/IP applications, need to download
another software, a <b>&#34;Packet Driver to ODI
Converter&#34;</b>. Converters are also called &#34;wrappers&#34; or a &#34;shim&#34;. We have
three options.

</p><ul>
  <li><code>ODIPKT.COM</code> v3.1 by Dan Lanciani (<a href="http://www.danlan.com">danlan.com</a>) at Harvard
    University. The software is public domain; its license allows free
    redistribution of binary and source and the modification of the source
    (assembler).
  </li><li><code>PKT2ODI.EXE</code> by Caldera. File is part of DR
    &#34;WebSpyder&#34;, a graphical DOS browser that Caldera released in
    1998. WebSpyder was licensed from xChaos/Arachne.
    Downloaded <a href="http://uk.evolt.m.flirble.org/dr-webspyder/2.0/">here</a>. It&#39;s
    license allows it to be evaluated and freely redistributed for
    non-commercial purposes.
  </li><li>If already running full NetWare, can use
    <code>IPXPKT.COM</code> to run a packetdriver over <code>IPX.COM</code>.
    <code>IPXPKT.COM</code> is free software by Crynwr and is a part of their
    packet driver collection <a href="http://www.crynwr.com/drivers/pktd11.zip"><code>PKTD11.ZIP</code></a>.
    This is a special case and will not be further investigated in this
    document.
</li></ul>

<p>With the MLID, the LSL and the converter we have most of the files needed.
The only one missing is the configuration file &#34;<code>NET.CFG</code>&#34;. An
example file with settings supposed for your card may be found on the CD or
floppy that came with it and should be located in the same directory as the
ODI driver.

</p><h4>Configuration of NET.CFG</h4>

Edit main configuration file <code>NET.CFG</code>. If it
doesn&#39;t exist, create it. Choose a directory - default locations
of <code>NET.CFG</code> seem to be <code>C:\NWCLIENT</code> or
<code>C:\NET</code>. The location should be in same directory,
where <code>LSL.COM</code> and driver is found.
An <a href="http://lazybrowndog.net/freedos/net.cfg_example.txt">example <code>NET.CFG</code></a> which
came with the 3Com 3C574 PC Card shows a lot of configuration settings, that
are needed for Novell NetWare and other software. For using packet driver
based TCP/IP applications the following four lines in <code>NET.CFG</code>
are enough:
<pre>--- NET.CFG ---
Link Support
  buffers 8 1600

Link Driver 3C574
 Frame Ethernet_II</pre>

<h5>Explanation of the parameters</h5>

Line &#34;<code>Link Support</code>&#34; configures the LSL. Options are:
&#34;<code>buffers</code>&#34;, &#34;<code>max boards</code>&#34;, &#34;<code>max stacks</code>&#34;
and &#34;<code>mempool</code>&#34;. We only need to set: buffers 8 1600

<p>Determines number and size of receive buffers of the LSL.
Default communication number for TCP/IP is 8. Author of ODIPKT, Dan
Lanciani <a href="http://groups.google.de/group/comp.protocols.tcp-ip/msg/b8ba79ab39cacc4f">recommends</a>
to use a buffer size of 1600 bytes for ODIPKT.
</p><p>Link Driver 3C574 configures the MLID (driver of network card). First,
 the name of driver is specified.  Change to the name of your NIC.
Configure the &#34;<code>frame</code>&#34; or &#34;<code>envelope type</code>&#34;
(both declarations work and mean the same thing) used by this driver:
</p><pre>Frame Ethernet_II</pre>

It is possible to define more than one frame type here: We already heard
that ODI is a multiprotocol driver, so the MLID is able to use more than one
frame and protocol with the same hardware network board. For this purpose it
defines <i>logical boards</i> for each defined frame. Possible frames are for
instance &#34;<code>ETHERNET_II</code>&#34; (IP protocol),
&#34;<code>ETHERNET_802.2</code>&#34; or &#34;<code>ETHERNET_802.3</code>&#34; (both IPX/SPX
protocol).

<p>For the packet driver converter, that we want to start later, it is
mandatory to define at least the Ethernet II frame here. You also have to
inform ODIPKT in a command line parameter to use the board with the
<code>ETHERNET_II</code> frame (see below).

</p><p>Full documentation of parameters in <code>NET.CFG</code> see
<a href="http://www.docs.hp.com/en/J2771-90016/index.html">&#34;NetWare Client
for DOS and MS Windows Technical Reference&#34;</a>.

</p><h4><a name="Installing1">Installing ODI drivers</a></h4><a name="Installing1">

Once configured <code>NET.CFG</code> start ODI drivers in
<code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> at boot. The first thing to start is Link Support Layer:</a><p><a name="Installing1">To use other values may try a
</a><a href="http://www.langeneggers.ch/Nuetzliches/Hex_Dez.htm">hex-dec
calculator</a> or see the following list:
</p><pre>0x60 = 96
0x61 = 97
0x62 = 98
 ...
0x69 = 105
0x6A = 106
 ...
0x7D = 125
0x7E = 126</pre>

Packet driver is installed. Use command &#34;ping&#34; from the WATTCP package to test.

<h4>Alternative 2: PKT2ODI</h4>

An alternative is Caldera&#39;s <code>PKT2ODI.EXE</code> as
Packet Driver to ODI Converter.
<code>PKT2ODI.EXE</code> will be started in
<code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> with command:
LH C:\NETWORK\NWCLIENT\PKT2ODI.EXE /B:1 /I:69

<p>The &#34;<code>/B</code>&#34; option tells <code>PKT2ODI</code> which logical
board to use. As previously choose board that
uses the Ethernet II frame. Different to ODIPKT, PKT2ODI starts counting
with &#34;<code>1</code>&#34;, so if <code>NET.CFG</code> appears:
</p><pre>--- NET.CFG ---
Link Driver 3C574
  FRAME ETHERNET_II
  FRAME ETHERNET_802.2
  FRAME ETHERNET_802.3
  FRAME ETHERNET_SNAP</pre>

use parameter: PKT2ODI.EXE /B:1
