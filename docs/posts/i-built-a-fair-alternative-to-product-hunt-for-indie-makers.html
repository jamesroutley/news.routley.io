    <h1>Show HN: I built a fair alternative to Product Hunt for indie makers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>I’m an indie maker, just like many of you. A few months back, I launched a product on one of the big platforms, and... nothing. It got buried under dozens of other launches within hours. All that work, all that excitement is gone in the blink of an eye. No one even saw it.</p><p>It stung. I wasn’t mad, well, maybe a little but mostly, I just felt invisible. The truth is, indie makers like me don’t have big teams or budgets to fight for visibility. We rely on genuine support and connections. I couldn’t stop thinking about how many great ideas never get the attention they deserve because they’re overshadowed.</p><p>So, I decided to build something different: <a href="https://itslaunched.com" rel="nofollow">https://itslaunched.com</a></p><p>Here’s the idea:</p><p>• 10 launches per day, max. Limiting the number of daily launches ensures that every product gets its moment in the spotlight.</p><p>• 2 votes per user, per day. This isn’t a popularity contest. You only get two votes, so people have to really think about which products they want to support. It’s quality over quantity.</p><p>• “Under Radar” feature. This one’s my favorite. If a product doesn’t get much love on its launch day, it gets a second chance to shine the next day. Because timing shouldn’t be the only thing standing between you and success.</p><p>There’s more like badges, comments, streaks but the heart of it is simple: a fair shot for indie makers.</p><p>I built this because I believe every product deserves to be seen, especially the ones built by solo makers and small teams putting their heart into something they truly care about. And I didn’t build this to compete with Product Hunt. I built it to give indie makers the platform they deserve, one where their creativity truly gets noticed.</p><p>If this sounds like something you’d want to check out, I’d love your thoughts. I’m still tweaking and improving it every day based on feedback.</p><p>Let me know what you think and if you’ve got a product you’re proud of, I’d love to see it shine.</p></div></td></div></div>
