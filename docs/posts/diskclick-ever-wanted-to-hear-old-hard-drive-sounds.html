    <h1>DiskClick: Ever wanted to hear old hard drive sounds</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever wanted to hear Old Hard drive sounds but don&#39;t want to go find a old pc or don&#39;t wanna get a old slow Clunker Hard drive. Well Fear not this program will let you emulate anything you want from a Floppy drive to a Rickroll. This Program uses your C drive to make noise based on real activity. If you want to load a new sample just click load folder and click from your own or ones i included. If you want to make your own just make a folder and put a load and looping wav in that folder. Looping is general ambiance/idle and load  is the emulated disk writing and reading data based on your actual C drive.<br/></p>


<p>Below is example of A general 90s HDD <br/></p>
<p>and a quantum bigfoot.</p>





<p>Requirements</p>
