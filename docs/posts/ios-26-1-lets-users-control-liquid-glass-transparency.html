<p>The new setting can be found on iOS and iPadOS by going to Settings &gt; Display and Brightness, or System Settings &gt; Appearance on the Mac.</p>
<p>Apple says that the new toggle was added because during the beta testing period over the summer, user feedback suggested that some people would prefer to have a more opaque option for Liquid Glass. The added setting provides additional customization in iOS 26.1, iPadOS 26.1, and macOS Tahoe 26.1. </p>
<p>Increasing opacity and adding contrast applies to Liquid Glass throughout the operating system, including in apps and Lock Screen notifications.</p>
<p>There are multiple other new features in iOS 26.1, including a new slide to stop feature for alarms and timers, new <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/">Apple Intelligence</a> languages, a redesigned <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/">Apple TV</a> app icon, changes to the Settings app, and more, with a full list of features <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-26-1-beta-features/">available in our iOS 26.1 feature guide</a>.</p>
