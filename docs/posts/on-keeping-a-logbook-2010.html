<blockquote><p>“Writers are the custodians of memory, and that’s what you must become if you want to leave some kind of record of your life…”<cite>— William Zinsser, <a href="http://www.theamericanscholar.org/how-to-write-a-memoir/">“How To Write A Memoir”</a></cite></p></blockquote>
<p>We all know <a href="http://www.austinkleon.com/2008/10/26/get-yourself-a-calendar/">keeping a calendar</a> of future events is important.</p>
<p>What about keeping a calendar of <em>past</em> events?</p>
<p>The best writing project I took on last year was what I call my logbook: a simple Moleskine daily planner in which I kept track of the little details of my day. Who, what, where types of details. Who I met, what I did, where I went, etc.</p>
<p>It’s not a diary or a journal. It’s a book of lists. The lists are simple facts.</p>
<p>Why not just keep a diary?</p>
<p>For one thing, I’m lazy. It’s easier to just list the events of the day than to craft them into a prose narrative. Any time I’ve tried to keep a journal, I ran out of steam pretty quick.</p>
<p>But more importantly, keeping a simple list of who/what/where means I write down events that seem mundane at the time, but later on help paint a better portrait of the day, or even become more significant over time. By “sticking to the facts” I don’t pre-judge what was important or what wasn’t, I just write it down.</p>
<p>Best of all, limiting each day to one page and breaking it down into a list instead of prose makes it easier for me to scan through it later, and get a real feel for the passing of time as I flip the pages.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logbook">Wikipedia</a> entry for “logbook”:</p>
<blockquote><p>A logbook was originally a book for recording readings from the log, and is used to determine the distance a ship traveled within a certain amount of time. The readings of the log have been recorded in equal times to give the distance traveled with respect to a given start position.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>The distance the ship traveled</em>. I like that.</p>
<p>(Below are a couple iPhone snapshots of example pages — these days aren’t significant, they’re just days with events benign enough to share with y’all.)</p>
