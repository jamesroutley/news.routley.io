    <h1>I&#39;ve been loving Claude Code on the web</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div>  <p>This week, I’ve been voraciously using <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-on-the-web">Claude Code on the web</a>.</p>

<p>It’s very much a “v1” product. You type a prompt to start a new thread, it launches a little container for your agent to work in, and you can keep talking to it. It produces a branch, which you can open a PR for (that’s the only way to see a diff of the changes Claude Code made, for now). Or if you want to keep working locally, you can copy a <code>claude --teleport &lt;uuid&gt;</code> command that brings the branch down onto your computer and continues the same thread with Claude Code locally.</p>
<p>Something about this early product is really great. I’ve been using it as a “to-do list that does itself” — when I think of something small that I want to tweak, across a variety of projects (work, work-related side project, side project, open source project) I just throw it into a thread. Then I come back, sometimes later in the day and sometimes days later, to see what Claude did and to finish things up.</p>
<p>It’s also available in the Claude iOS app, which has been great. When I’m walking and have a thought for something I want to know more about (for example, “What screens could be impacted by this change that I should test more thoroughly?”), I can just ask and know that the answer will be there for me when I come back.</p>
<p><a href="https://cursor.com/blog/agent-web">Cursor built this same thing 4 months ago</a>. I’ve tried their version a few times since, and I’ve never liked this much. Why?</p>
<p>I had trouble nailing down an answer, but I think the answer is actually just <em>product quality</em>. Cursor’s implementation is a bit finicky, loading states a bit jumpy, and things feel fragile. The font’s too small too, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Claude Code on the web feels very solid and dependable. And for some reason, that’s made the difference for me this week.</p>  </div>      </div></div>
