      <p>All browsers add an <code>8px</code> margin
on the <code>body</code> element –
it’s part of the w3c-recommended
<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#html-stylesheet">default stylesheet</a>
which browsers generally use
as a starting point
for their own ‘user agent’ styles.
But why <code>8px</code>?
Where does that come<span> </span>from?</p>
    

    
      <h2>Initial values vs browser<span> </span>defaults</h2>
<p>Every property in <span>CSS</span> has an <em>initial value</em>.
That initial value is the same
for all elements across the entire web.
The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-display/#the-display-properties">initial value of <code>display</code></a>
is <code>inline</code>,
and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-box/#margin">initial value of every <code>margin</code> property</a>
is <code>0</code>.</p>
<p>Initial values are used
when no other value is specified by the <em>Cascade</em>,
or <em>inherited</em> from elsewhere.
We can also revert our styles explicitly
to their initial value
using the <code>initial</code> keyword.</p>
<p>But if we stop there,
initial values don’t provide a great
reading experience.
When all the properties are the same
on all the elements,
there’s no visual differentiation between
a link, a paragraph, a heading, or a list.
We can see that
by using the
<a href="https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2019/11/02/most-normal/">Ultimate <span>CSS</span> Reset</a>:</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<p>This is why we need <strong>browser styles</strong>,
which provide <em>different defaults</em>
from one element to the next.
Some elements should be <code>display: block</code>
(divs, paragraphs, lists, headings, etc),
and some of those elements
should have margins on them
to improve<span> </span>readability.</p>
<p>We can revert any property on a given element
to the browser default style
by using the <code>revert</code> keyword.
Technically this removes any styles from the author origin,
but since user-origin styles are rare,
it often results in styles from the<span> </span>browser.</p>
<h2>Standardizing browser defaults</h2>
<p>Browser styles are essential,
but we often only notice them
when they seem ‘wrong’ or unexpected –
and think of them
as a problem to be solved
with ‘resets’ and<span> </span>‘normalization’.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Resets</em> remove defaults to achieve a more ‘blank<span> </span>canvas’</li>
<li><em>Normalizers</em> attempt to make the defaults more consistent across<span> </span>browsers</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span>CSS</span> Working Group
and browser vendors
also understand that default styles work best
when they are more consistent
across different browsers.
While browsers are free to
provide whatever styles they want,
most browser defaults can be traced back
to the (non-normative)
<a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css2/#html-stylesheet">default style sheet</a>
provided in the <span>CSS</span><span> </span>specifications.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if there’s a more recent version somewhere,
but I couldn’t find<span> </span>it?</p>
<details data-pattern="figure">
<summary><span>CSS</span> 2.2 default style sheet</summary>
<pre><code><span>html, address,</span>   <span>{</span> <span>display</span><span>:</span> block<span>;</span> <span>unicode-bidi</span><span>:</span> embed <span>}</span></code></pre>
</details>
<p>Some of those default styles seem obvious –
block elements should have block display,
table elements need table displays,
and list elements need list displays.
Headings get larger, bolder text.
But other default styles
seem pretty arbitrary.
About a third of the way down,
we find this<span> </span>one:</p>
<pre><code><span>body</span> <span>{</span> <span>margin</span><span>:</span> 8px<span>;</span> <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It makes some sense to me
that we would want some default spacing
around the edges of our document,
but why <code>8px</code>?
Where did that come<span> </span>from?</p>
<h2>Nothing ever goes away<span> </span>completely</h2>
<p>The <em>default style sheet</em>
isn’t only there
to ensure consistency between browsers,
but also to ensure
consistency across time.
The entire web is designed
to be forwards-and-backwards compatible.
That doesn’t mean the web is static –
we’re getting new features all the time –
but it means those new features
should never break existing<span> </span>websites.</p>
<p>On rare occasions
a browser will decide to break existing sites
if there are privacy or security issues.
But we do everything we can
to avoid those situations.
And often,
browsers will choose to ‘deprecate’
a feature (like the old <code>marquee</code> element)
without actually removing<span> </span>support.</p>
<p>Browser default styles follow a similar pattern.
Since <span>CSS</span> was first implemented in browsers,
there have been default browser styles.
And, while browsers add new defaults on occasion,
it’s very uncommon to remove an old default.
There’s too much potential
to break sites that relied on the default
when they were<span> </span>made.</p>
<p>Many of the default styles
we have in browsers today
are the same defaults that existed
back when an <span>HTML</span> element was first<span> </span>introduced.</p>
<h2>Purity vs reality in<span> </span>specification</h2>
<p>There’s another rule
that impacts the development of standards –
even non-normative standards
(not officially ‘required’ for conformance)
like the default style<span> </span>sheet:</p>
<p><em>A standard is meaningless unless it describes<span> </span>reality</em>.</p>
<p>To be successful,
a standard has to be both <em>prescriptive</em>
(telling browsers what to implement),
and also retroactively <em>descriptive</em>
(describing what browsers actually implemented).
It’s not helpful to have a specification
that is theoretically perfect,
if it doesn’t accurately describe the<span> </span>web.</p>
<p>While we often write new standards to explain
how a new feature <em>should</em> work,
and then expect browsers to implement
the feature as specified,
that’s only the first step
in a more complicated back-and-forth process.
We also regularly revisit and revise existing standards
to reflect how features <em>actually</em> work,
after they have been<span> </span>implemented.</p>
<p>Ideally,
when an implementation doesn’t match the spec,
we want to consider that a browser issue,
and fix the browser.
But sometimes –
depending how big the change,
how many browsers would need to change,
and how many sites would be impacted –
we’ll update the specification<span> </span>instead.</p>
<p>That’s not the only way we end up with
<a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/mistakes">mistakes in the design of <span>CSS</span></a>,
but it makes mistakes harder to fix
when they do show<span> </span>up.</p>
<p>Again,
we’re prioritizing
<em>consistency</em> across browsers and time,
over <em>theoretical purity</em>
of the standards<span> </span>themselves.</p>
<h2>A margin on all our<span> </span>bodies</h2>
<p>Last month
I decided to track down the origins
of this<span> </span>style:</p>
<pre><code><span>body</span> <span>{</span> <span>margin</span><span>:</span> 8px <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>I knew it was part of the
default style sheet,
and I assumed it would be a legacy style –
initially provided by one of the early browsers,
and eventually standardized
for the sake of web-and-browser<span> </span>consistency.</p>
<p>But where did it come from originally?
I decided to <a href="https://twitter.com/TerribleMia/status/1537986972177747968">ask twitter</a>,
and eventually we were able to
(mostly) track it<span> </span>down.</p>
<h3>Step 1: The<span> </span>specification</h3>
<p>Alan Stearns
(one of the current <span>CSSWG</span> chairs)
pointed me to
the first specification with <code>8px</code> margin
in the default style<span> </span>sheet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spec-wise, it first showed up in 2003
<a href="https://w3.org/TR/2003/WD-CSS21-20030128/sample.html">https://w3.org/<span>TR</span>/2003/<span>WD</span>-<span>CSS21</span>-20030128/sample.html</a>.
The version from the previous year had padding:<span> </span>8px</p>
<p>—@alanstearns,
<a href="https://twitter.com/alanstearns/status/1537999498210779138">June 17 @<span> </span>8:34pm</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Whoops, off by one. The 2003 had padding.
2004 changed to margin
<a href="https://w3.org/TR/2004/CR-CSS21-20040225/sample.html">https://w3.org/<span>TR</span>/2004/<span>CR</span>-<span>CSS21</span>-20040225/sample.html</a></p>
<p>—@alanstearns,
<a href="https://twitter.com/alanstearns/status/1538000075577667586">June 17 @<span> </span>9:26pm</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The change from padding to margin is interesting.
But I figure
these spec style sheets
were likely describing some prior browser reality –
not inventing the style from<span> </span>scratch?</p>
<h3>Step 2: The original<span> </span>browsers</h3>
<p>There are several links that I revisit on occasion,
when I’m curious about the early history of <span>CSS</span>.
My favorite are the source documents<span> </span>themselves:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html">Cascading <span>HTML</span> style sheets – a proposal</a>
by <strong>Håkon Lie</strong>
(the proposal that became<span> </span><span>CSS</span>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/History/">Historical Style Sheet<span> </span>proposals</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But there are also great articles
that tell the story of how <span>CSS</span> came to<span> </span>be:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html">A brief history of <span>CSS</span> until 2016</a>
by <strong>Bert Bos</strong>
(co-author of the original <span>CSS</span><span> </span>spec)</li>
<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/look-back-history-css/">A Look Back at the History of <span>CSS</span></a>
by <strong>Jay Hoffmann</strong> on<span> </span><span>CSS</span>-Tricks</li>
<li><a href="https://eager.io/blog/the-languages-which-almost-were-css/">The Languages Which Almost Became <span>CSS</span></a>
by <strong>Zack<span> </span>Bloom</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are excellent,
and I highly recommend reading through them
to understand why this language works the way it<span> </span>does.</p>
<p>That got me a list of the first browsers with <span>CSS</span>,
but it didn’t give me any more detail on the body margin<span> </span>question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For context,
<span>IE3</span> was the first commercial browser with <span>CSS</span>.
That’s 1996.
Then Netscape 4 added some support.
Before either of those,
<span>CSS</span> was being tested in Argo <span>&amp;</span> Arena…
How far back does it<span> </span>go???</p>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html">https://www.w3.org/Style/<span>CSS20</span>/history.html</a></p>

<a href="https://twitter.com/TerribleMia/status/1538006627151818756">June 17 @<span> </span>9:52pm</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Step 3: The www-talk <span>&amp;</span> www-style<span> </span>archives</h3>
<p>Of course,
most of those ‘historic style proposals’
were originally written as emails
to the
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/"><code>www-talk@w3.org</code> mailing list</a>,
or (later) the more focussed
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/"><code>www-style@w3.org</code> list</a> –
both of which are well-archived,
and<span> </span>searchable.</p>
<p>(One advantage of having a medium
created by a bunch of information-science<span> </span>nerds.)</p>
<p>Searching the archives
lead me to an email from
Todd Fahrner in March of 1998 –
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/1998Mar/0092.html"><em>Re: <span>IE</span>, <span>NN</span> and background-position:<span> </span>thpppt!</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>My most recent revision to the “Base Stylesheet”[1] has the body margin set
to 0 and the padding set at 8 pixels. Previously I had the margin at 8
pixels, 0 padding, and the background-position set to<span> </span>-8px.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[1] <a href="http://www.verso.com/agitprop/corestyle/base.html">http://www.verso.com/agitprop/corestyle/base.html</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s an email thread
about the proper handling
of background-images,
so not exactly on topic,
but there’s our 8px padding-or-margin on the<span> </span>body.</p>
<h3>Step 4: The wayback<span> </span>machine</h3>
<p>That reference link is broken,
so I jumped over to
<a href="https://web.archive.org/">The WayBack Machine</a>
to see if there was an archived copy –
and there are<span> </span>several!</p>
<p>First, I landed on
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990222082453/http://www.verso.com/agitprop/corestyle/base.html">The Base Stylesheet - February 22, 1999</a>,
which claims it was <em>last modified 7 November 1998</em>.
Then I clicked through to the earliest archive of the page –
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990222082453/http://www.verso.com/agitprop/corestyle/base.html">The Base Stylesheet - January 30, 1998</a> –
which says it was <em>last modified 07/04/2022 16:39:51 <span>GMT</span></em>
(the exact moment I loaded the<span> </span>page).</p>
<p>Wait, what?
Inspecting the source code,
I found<span> </span>this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>p</span><span>&gt;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I assume the <code>document.lastModified</code> is getting updated
by The WayBack Machine
every time we load the<span> </span>page?</p>
<h3>Final answer: the base<span> </span>stylesheet</h3>
<p>This is what we’ve been looking for:
the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990222082453/http://www.verso.com/agitprop/corestyle/base.html">original default style sheet</a>,
still under development.
There are a few quotes that stand<span> </span>out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Base Stylesheet describes
the “consensus default” rendering of all <span>HTML</span> 4.0 elements
in Mosaic-derivative Web browsers
(Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer).
It … captures the status quo in order to move beyond<span> </span>it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those are the major browser-engines at the time,
and they both trace their roots back to
the previous Mosaic<span> </span>browser.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Mosaic browser’s allegedly “neutral” default stylesheet
is a simple adaptation of the normative style
for (printed) scientific writings in Europe
(cf. Wanning, Frank; Internationaler Typographie
und wissenschaftliche Textverarbeitung; Haag + Herchen, 1996).
This is appropriate enough considering the Web’s origins at <span>CERN</span>.
In view of the Web’s far more common applications
in commerce, entertainment, journalism, and the humanities, however,
and the deeply entrenched market dominance of Mosaic-based browsers,
it is fair to say that “correct” <span>HTML</span>
has been infected with a reliably inappropriate style,
like a cancer or<span> </span>virus.</p>
<p>The escape of the Mosaic Browser Default Stylesheet (<span>MBDS</span>) virus
from the scientific community at <span>CERN</span>
has produced Web generations of mutant tools
and authors who misapply markup solely to invoke certain <span>MBDS</span> effects.
The use of <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> to produce vertical whitespace
and table structures for nontabular information are signature examples.
The high reliability of such manipulation
accounts for <span>HTML</span>’s grotesque cannibalization beyond academia,
and the market success of architecturally incongruous <span>HTML</span> extensions
for symptomatic relief.
To reverse this epidemic,
it is necessary first to isolate the virus,
and expose its genes to precise and comprehensive manipulation.
The Base Stylesheet is a <span>CSS1</span> model of the <span>MBDS</span> virus,
and the first step toward the development of “style antibodies” -
comprehensive alternative stylesheets for<span> </span><span>HTML</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lol, the snark.</p>
<p>So there you have it.
This style sheet is meant to capture
<em>what was already happening before <span>CSS</span> existed</em>
in Mosaic-based browsers,
and <em>recreate those styles in <span>CSS</span></em>.
The <code>8px</code> spacing on the body predates <span>CSS</span>!
The style likely comes directly from Mosaic’s internal rules,
before <span>CSS</span> was invented,
so the only remaining question is
<em>how to represent it</em> –
as either <code>padding</code> or eventually a <code>margin</code>.</p>
<details data-pattern="figure">
<summary>Todd Fahrner’s (early draft) Base Stylesheet</summary>
<pre><code><span>A, <span>ABBR</span>, <span>ACRONYM</span>, <span>ADDRESS</span>, <span>BDO</span>, <span>BLOCKQUOTE</span>, <span>BODY</span>, <span>BUTTON</span>, <span>CITE</span>, <span>CODE</span>, <span>DD</span>, <span>DEL</span>,</span> <span>{</span></code></pre>
</details>
<h2>A remedy for the <span>MBDS</span><span> </span>virus?</h2>
<p>The plan didn’t work out
exactly the way Todd Fahrner imagined.
That base style sheet lives on,
with a number of Mosaic-based styles intact.
There are no <em>comprehensive alternative stylesheets for <span>HTML</span></em> –
at least not from the w3c
or the browser vendors.
Both are too invested in backwards-compatibility
to make any radical changes
to the default styles of the<span> </span>web.</p>
<p>If it’s going to happen,
it will have to come from web authors
who can choose to opt-in to a new stylesheet,
without worrying about backwards compatibility.
To some extent,
you can think of
various resets and normalizers
as attempts at a new comprehensive stylesheet –
tho resets generally remove too much
(relying on authors to put it all back),
and normalizers often worry more about
browser-consistency more than improved<span> </span>styles.</p>
<p>This is what lead
Jen Simmons to create
<a href="https://github.com/jensimmons/cssremedy"><span>CSS</span> Remedy</a>.
(I’m one of the core contributors,
though there hasn’t been much work on it recently).
The goal is to re-imagine a ‘default’ stylesheet
for the modern web.
What would we come up with now,
if we weren’t constrained
by what Mosaic did almost 30 years ago?
There’s still a lot of discussion,
but one thing is clear
<a href="https://github.com/jensimmons/cssremedy/blob/master/css/remedy.css#L47">on line 47 of the main remedy stylesheet</a>:</p>
<pre><code><span>body</span> <span>{</span> <span>margin</span><span>:</span> 0<span>;</span> <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>For the most part,
<span>CSS</span> Remedy isn’t trying to make things pretty –
just trying to provide a better default.
There are also projects
that take a more opinionated approach,
providing fully-designed styles for basic <span>HTML</span><span> </span>elements.</p>
<p>Last month,
Robin Rendle posted some thoughts
on <a href="https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/the-smallest-css/">The Smallest <span>CSS</span></a> –
<em>What’s the smallest amount of <span>CSS</span> that you can write
to make <span>HTML</span> look halfway decent?</em>
It’s a great little exploration,
landing on about 15 lines of<span> </span><span>CSS</span>.</p>
<p>I also appreciate the
<a href="https://css-tricks.com/no-class-css-frameworks/">‘no-class frameworks’</a> –
based entirely on writing semantic html,
without any need for special selectors.
Here are some more
<a href="https://github.com/dbohdan/classless-css">classless <span>CSS</span> libraries</a>
to look<span> </span>at.</p>
<p>I’m tempted to try something like that myself.
We’ll see.
Maybe this site is almost due
for a<span> </span>refresh.</p>
