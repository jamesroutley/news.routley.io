    <h1>Incus – Next-generation system container, application container, and VM manager</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Incus is a next-generation system container, application container, and virtual machine manager.</p>
<p>It provides a user experience similar to that of a public cloud. With it, you can easily mix and match both containers and virtual machines, sharing the same underlying storage and network.</p>
<p>Incus is image based and provides images for a <a href="https://images.linuxcontainers.org">wide number of Linux distributions</a>. It provides flexibility and scalability for various use cases, with support for different storage backends and network types and the option to install on hardware ranging from an individual laptop or cloud instance to a full server rack.</p>
<p>When using Incus, you can manage your instances (containers and VMs) with a simple command line tool, directly through the REST API or by using third-party tools and integrations. Incus implements a single REST API for both local and remote access.</p>
<p>The Incus project <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/announcement/">was created</a> by Aleksa Sarai as a community driven alternative to Canonical&#39;s LXD.</p>

<p>To get a better idea of what Incus is and what it does, you can <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/try-it/">try it online</a>!</p>
<p>Then if you want to run it locally, take a look at our <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/tutorial/first_steps/">getting started guide</a>.</p>

<p>Incus provides support for system containers, application containers, and virtual machines.</p>
<p>When running a system container, Incus simulates a virtual version of a full operating system. To do this, it uses the functionality provided by the kernel running on the host system.</p>
<p>When running an application container, Incus runs isolated applications within the host&#39;s operating system using container images, similar to how Docker operates.</p>
<p>When running a virtual machine, Incus uses the hardware of the host system, but the kernel is provided by the virtual machine. Therefore, virtual machines can be used to run, for example, a different operating system.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the differences between application containers, system containers and virtual machines in <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/explanation/containers_and_vms/">our documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Incus works on any recent Linux distribution.</p>
<p>Incus upstream doesn&#39;t directly provide packages, but packages are available in a number of distributions or can be found in 3rd party repositories.</p>
<p>In addition, the Incus client is available for Windows and macOS. You can use the client to connect to an Incus server running on a Linux machine.</p>
<p>Current installation instructions can be found in our <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/incus/docs/main/installing/">installation guide</a>.</p>

<p>Incus has two kind of releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>LTS releases</li>
<li>Feature releases</li>
</ul>
<p>The current LTS release is Incus 6.0 and is supported until June 2029.</p>
<p>Feature releases are pushed out every month or so and contain new features as well as bugfixes.</p>
