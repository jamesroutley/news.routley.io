<li>hey! hi! hello!</li>
<li>still trying to think of a fun little project to bring to life with code, and still coming up blank, but it worries me less now. when the idea comes i will latch upon it and not let go.</li>
<li>went to see a horror movie called bring her back yesterday. acting is so amazing and funny, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hawkins">mum and villain</a> in the horror film is the mum in Paddington (as in the bear who eats marmalade sandwiches) and I would never have noticed if I hadn&#39;t read the letterboxd reviews for the film! i love horror films and i think i found this one a bit sad and harrowing (which is what we like to see), not sure i&#39;d watch it again but &#34;enjoyed&#34; myself ha ha.</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been reading more of unmasking for life and even though it&#39;s lots of things i&#39;ve thought about in discrete chunks it&#39;s helpful to see all the autism-related life things collated in one volume. i recommend it so far.</li>
<li>on the more oopy-goopy feelings stuff, i am struggling a lot with &#34;creative resistance&#34; at the minute. writing these weeknotes is fine when i do it, but other writing has felt like i need to drag myself to the laptop, force myself to open the documents, wrench myself away from endless research, and so on and so forth. i know some people would say you should let yourself be in whatever season you&#39;re in (aka give up and left yourself scroll tiktok or whatever), but i&#39;d prefer to write more even if i didn&#39;t end up posting my output, rather than thinking about writing or doing other less fun and less useful things with all my free time. i think at the minute i&#39;m trying to work through the &#34;don&#39;t wanna!&#34; by being gentle with myself and doing small bursts, and there&#39;s other exercises i can try. was hoping writing this i&#39;d have some epiphany about it, but no luck! i do think focusing less on perfect output has helped a lot â€”Â focus on quantity and the quality will appear â€”Â but still, you do actually have to create things to improve in creation lol.</li>
<li>it&#39;s weird writing these so early in the day, not that anything usually ever happens on sundays for me, they are very much a rest day. i usually leave them till the evening, as what if something did happen?! but i am getting over myself, one step at a time.</li>
<li>been a bit obsessed with this version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXiFHDfvn4A">moon river</a>.</li>
<li>reminding myself that i haven&#39;t updated <a href="https://olu.online/ai">my ai page</a>, and have to do that today!</li>
<li>cooking up a summary/honestly just another iteration of my talk building better webs for <a href="https://gfsc.community">gfsc</a> and still working on my script about whether social media has to shit. i will finish something, one of these days! also for <a href="https://olu.online/blog/?q=alphabet-superset">alphabet superset</a> i&#39;m thinking of writing a bit about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Safety_Act_2023">online safety act</a>. o is the 15th letter of the alphabet, i just checked, so i&#39;m hoping to write a post in this series at least once every fortnight, and i can wrap it up by the end of the year. we&#39;ll see!</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been eating nocellara olives, hot dogs, cereal made up of flakes, chips and everything bagels. i&#39;ve been drinking whole milk, matcha lattes, pineapple and coconut smoothies, and small amounts of plain water.</li>
<li>hope you had a great week. see you soon? ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
