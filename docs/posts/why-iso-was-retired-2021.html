    <p>Some time ago I stopped releasing EasyOS as an ISO file, from
      then onward as a drive image file only. This has been contentious,
      and I receive emails from people lamenting the demise of the ISO.
      So, I should post some thoughts why I made this decision. Not an
      exhaustive rationale, just some thoughts while I think of them
      right now...<br/>
    </p>
    <p>The ISO9660 file format is very old, going right back to 1988,
      and has since then had enhancements bolted on, see the <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660">Wikipedia ISO9660
        page</a>. In addition, there is the &#34;hybrid ISO&#34;, enabling
      booting from a USB-stick, and on top of that enhancements to
      enable booting from either or both legacy-BIOS and UEFI firmware
      computers, see <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://wiki.syslinux.org/wiki/index.php?title=Isohybrid">here</a>.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>What all of the above means is that ISO files are a &#34;dogs
      breakfast&#34;, a hodge podge of changes bolted on over the years.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>A Linux distribution provided on a drive image file, in
      comparison, is very simple. And, very simple to setup to boot on
      either or both legacy-BIOS and UEFI computers.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>Given that optical drives are rapidly receeding into history, and
      these days we boot from either a USB-stick or install direct to a
      hard drive partition, what are the differences in doing that, ISO
      versus image file? <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the case of booting from USB-stick, the answer is: <SPAN size="+2"><b><SPAN color="#cc0000">none</SPAN></b></SPAN><br/>
    </p>
    <p>You need a tool for writing the file, ISO or image-file, to the
      USB-stick, and plenty of such tools are available. For example,
      &#39;Etcher&#39; available on Windows, Mac and Linux, &#39;easydd&#39; on Linux,
      or on Linux you can even use the &#39;dd&#39; utility.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>As you are no longer writing to an optical media, you don&#39;t use a
      CD/DVD burner tool. That is the only change that you have to make.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>Having written the file to the USB-stick, ISO or drive-image, you
      need to configure the PC to boot from it, and you are in business.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>So, why have I received so many requests, via email and forum, to bring back an ISO file, and expressing opposition to the
      drive-image-file? That is an very interesting question, that
      puzzled me for a long time. OK, some more thoughts...<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>The ISO file is a &#34;wrong fit&#34; for a USB-stick<br/>
    </h2>
    <p>The iso file is a complete self-contained package. Let&#39;s say that
      you write a 550MB hybrid-ISO file to a 16GB USB-stick. This is
      what will be on the USB-stick:<br/>
    </p>
    
    <p>Why is creating a USB-stick that is mostly unusable, considered
      to be acceptable by most mainline Linux distributions? Simply
      because they only want to be able to boot the distribution for the
      purpose of installing it to a internal hard drive. So, they don&#39;t
      care that the rest of the USB-stick is unusable.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, a live-CD type of distribution, like Puppy
      Linux, it is an issue, because the &#34;save file&#34; can only be created
      on some other drive, usually an internal drive. Wouldn&#39;t it be
      nice if the &#34;save file&#34; or &#34;save folder&#34; could be on the
      USB-stick, or rather it would be nice if you had that choice.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>With a drive-image, the entire USB-stick is available. The EasyOS
      drive image has two partitions, a vfat &#34;boot partition&#34; and a ext4
      &#34;working partition&#34;. Initially, the working-partition is only
      640MiB or 816MiB, but at first bootup it automatically expands to fill the
      drive. So, this is what you have on the 16GB USB-stick:<br/>
    </p>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>boot<br/>
          </td>
          <td> --working-partition,
            using entire drive--<br/>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>...think about the implication of that for a moment. Unlike
      traditional Puppy, you don&#39;t have to try and decide where to
      create a &#34;save file&#34;. It already exists, as a &#34;save folder&#34; in the
      working-partition. <b><SPAN color="#cc0000">First bootup and you
          are in business, nothing else to do</SPAN></b>. <br/>
    </p>
    <p>And, you never again have to worry about the size of your &#34;save
      file&#34;. At first bootup you have automatically got the entire drive
      to play in.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>This is momentous, and thanks to Dima (forum member &#39;dimkr&#39;), our
      most prolific woof-CE developer, the next-generation Puppy is
      being offered as a drive-image.<br/>
    </p>
    <h2>Why so much opposition to dropping the ISO file?<br/>
    </h2>
    <p>I receive regular messages expressing opposition to dropping ISO
      files, mostly by email.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>What I have observed is that the messages are from Puppy
      old-timers. They have a collection of vintage PCs, all with
      optical drives. Optical media, CD/DVD, ISO files, that&#39;s what they
      know.<br/>
</p>
<p>Yes, I can understand, if you know something very well, have done it 
that way for years, there is resistance to change, even if there are 
compelling arguments to do so.<br/>
</p>
<p>
About a year ago, I received an email from a representative of a
      German Linux magazine. I think that magazine still ships printed
      magazines with a CD stuck on the front. Anyway, he wanted to
      review EasyOS and had some questions, and I replied, yeah, go for
      it.</p>


    
    <p>But, I became increasingly puzzled by his questions. They didn&#39;t
      make any sense. The penny finally dropped when I realised that he
      didn&#39;t have a clue what a Linux distribution on a drive-image file
      is. His knowledge was ISOs, ISOs and ISOs.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>...that taught me that even Linux experts, people who review
      Linux distributions, may have severe misunderstandings outside of
      their beloved ISO format.<br/>
</p>
<p>Which also taught me that resistance to the drive-image format may be due to not understanding it.<br/>
    </p>

    <h2>In conclusion<br/>
    </h2>
    <p>As mentioned above, the mainline distributions may stick with ISO
      format just because they have no compelling reason to change. They
      just want to boot the CD/DVD and then install their distribution
      to an internal drive.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>Other than that use-case, ISO has had it&#39;s day, and should be
      retired.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>Oh yes, there are some old computers that won&#39;t boot from USB,
      well they are ancient and approaching relegation to &#34;Silicon
      Heaven&#34; (you need to be a fan of the Red Dwarf TV series to know
      what <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://reddwarf.fandom.com/wiki/Silicon_Heaven">Silicon
        Heaven</a> is).<br/>
    </p>
    <p>There are some multi-boot tools, that enable putting many ISO
      files on the one USB-stick; however, the ISO format does not have
      any intrinsic avantage, these boot managers could also be made to
      boot image files.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>I cannot think of a single other use-case where you would want to
      stay with ISO files.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>For Linux developers, if you are interested, I have a script for
      creating a skeleton drive-image file, with a boot-partition and a
      working-partition, that will boot on either a legacy-BIOS or a
      modern UEFI PC. There are three scripts, &#39;2createpcskeletonimage&#39;,
      &#39;2createpcskeletonimage-encrypt&#39; and &#39;2createpcskeletonimage-gpt&#39;
      -- for easyOS I currently use the middle one, which creates a
      MSDOS partition table and enables ext4 fscrypt in the
      working-partition. Syslinux is used for legacy-BIOS booting,
      rEFInd for UEFI booting. These scripts are in the woofQ tarball,
      available <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://distro.ibiblio.org/easyos/project/woofq/">here</a>.<br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      Dima has a similar script. He is using Syslinux and Efilinux.</p>
    <p>What motivated me to create this blog post, is discussion
      starting here on the Puppy Forum:</p>

      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN color="#003300">There have been a few posts about using a
        multi-boot tool such as Ventoy, how convenient to just drop an
        ISO file onto the Ventoy USB stick, and add it to the boot-list.
        <br/>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN color="#003300">However, what needs to be pointed out is
        that the ISO file has no intrinsic advantage over an image-file.
        The boot manager can be made to treat an image file as a
        package, just like an ISO file, and boot it. Quoting from the
        Ventoy front page:<br/>
      </SPAN></p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><SPAN size="+1" color="#003300"><i>Directly boot from
            ISO/WIM/IMG/VHD(x)/EFI files, <b>no extraction needed</b> </i></SPAN><SPAN color="#003300"><br/>
        </SPAN></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><SPAN color="#003300">And I see that EasyOS is ticked:<br/>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN color="#003300"><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="https://bkhome.org/news/202112/images/ventoy-tick.png" alt="img1" width="334" height="195"/><br/>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN color="#003300">...snapshot is from <a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/distrowatch.html">here</a>.
        Numbering on the left column is Distrowatch ranking.<br/>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN color="#003300">I received one email that EasyOS is more
        difficult to boot in a virtual machine, such as qemu. Again,
        there is no intrinsic reason why the drive image file should be
        any more difficult than with an ISO.<br/>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN color="#003300">I have received messages from people who
        have run EasyOS in a virtual machine, but as it hasn&#39;t
        interested me personally, I never got into documenting how to do
        it. Good, news, I see that Dima has posted how to run his
        next-generation Puppy image-file with qemu:<br/>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN color="#003300"><a moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewtopic.php?p=43900#p43900">https://forum.puppylinux.com/viewtopic.php?p=43900#p43900</a><br/>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN color="#003300">So, I am repeating, there are no use-cases
        where the ISO format has an advantage over a Linux distribution
        as a drive image file. The perceived advantages are only due to
        ignorance.</SPAN><br/>
    </p>
    <p><SPAN color="#330000">One more thing, while I think of it. A
        couple of people have commented that it is more difficult to
        extract the contents of an image file, vmlinuz, etc., if you
        want to do a direct frugal install to a internal hard drive.
        WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!<br/>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN color="#330000">In EasyOS, you just click on the image file
        and it opens up and you can copy out the files. You do not have
        to write it to a USB-stick or try to figure out how to mount the
        partition inside the image file.<br/>
      </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN color="#330000">In the pups, you have single-click opening
        of ISO and SFS files. EasyOS has added that for image files. It
        is just an implementation detail, easy enough to add to the
        pups.</SPAN> <br/>
