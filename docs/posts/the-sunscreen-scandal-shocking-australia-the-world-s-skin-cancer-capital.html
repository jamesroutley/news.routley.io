The group had tested 20 sunscreens in an independent accredited Australian lab, finding 16 did not meet the SPF, or skin protection factor, rating listed on the packet.</p><p>Ultra Violette&#39;s Lean Screen SPF 50+ Mattifying Zinc Skinscreen, a facial product that Rach says she used exclusively, was the &#34;most significant failure&#34; identified. It returned a result of SPF 4, something that shocked Choice so much it commissioned a second test that produced a similar reading.</p><p>Other products that did not meet their SPF claims included those from Neutrogena, Banana Boat, Bondi Sands and the Cancer Council - but they all rejected Choice&#39;s findings and said their own independent testing showed their sunscreens worked as advertised.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250828-055926-c20c0c03f5-2.28.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/afd9/live/4d52f570-8965-11f0-9df7-33c9b75a833d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/afd9/live/4d52f570-8965-11f0-9df7-33c9b75a833d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/afd9/live/4d52f570-8965-11f0-9df7-33c9b75a833d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/afd9/live/4d52f570-8965-11f0-9df7-33c9b75a833d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/afd9/live/4d52f570-8965-11f0-9df7-33c9b75a833d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/afd9/live/4d52f570-8965-11f0-9df7-33c9b75a833d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/afd9/live/4d52f570-8965-11f0-9df7-33c9b75a833d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/afd9/live/4d52f570-8965-11f0-9df7-33c9b75a833d.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A young cricket player, her red hair braided over her shoulder, rubbing in sunscreen"/><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>For decades Australians have been urged to slip on a shirt, slop on sunscreen and slap on a hat</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>The uproar was immediate for the brands named in the report, and also prompted a swift response from the Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA), which said it would investigate the findings and &#34;take regulatory action as required&#34;.</p><p>Ultra Violette bit back, saying they were &#34;confident that Lean Screen is safe and effective&#34; and detailing extensive testing of the product – which has been sold in almost 30 countries, including the UK, and retails for upwards of A$50 (£24, $33).</p><p>But less than two months later, it announced that Lean Screen would be recalled after it returned inconsistent results across eight different sets of lab testing.</p><p>&#34;We are deeply sorry that one of our products has fallen short of the standards we pride ourselves on and that you have come to expect of us,&#34; read a statement published to the brand&#39;s Instagram account.</p><p>It added that it has &#34;since ended the relationship with the initial testing lab&#34;.</p><p>In the past fortnight, other brands have &#34;paused&#34; the sale of at least four more products, none of which were included in the Choice report.</p><p>Rach knows there is no way to prove that there is a link between her diagnosis and the brand of sunscreen she relied on.

So, how did this happen?</p><p>An investigation by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation found that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-07-04/questions-over-lab-that-tested-sunscreen-spf-claims/105458458">a single US-based laboratory had certified at least half of the products</a> that had failed Choice&#39;s testing, and that this facility routinely recorded high test results.</p><p>It also found that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-30/sunscreen-spf-consumer-protection-base-formula/105711012">several of the sunscreens pulled from shelves shared a similar base formula</a> and linked them to a manufacturer in Western Australia.</p><p>The TGA says it does not usually speak about ongoing investigations because it does not want to compromise them, but that it is also looking into &#34;reviewing existing SPF testing requirements&#34; which can be &#34;highly subjective&#34;.</p><p>&#34;The TGA is also aware that it is common practice for different sunscreen products to share the same or similar base formulations,&#34; a spokesperson said in a statement to the BBC.</p><p>&#34;Ultimately it is the sponsor&#39;s [seller&#39;s] responsibility to ensure that their medicine remains compliant with all applicable legislative requirements.&#34;</p><p>Consistent and comfortable sunscreens which offer high protection are very technical and difficult to make, says Dr Wong, founder of Lab Muffin Beauty Science. </p><p>Everyone&#39;s skin responds differently to the product, he adds, and it&#39;s one that is almost always being stress-tested – by sweat, water, or makeup.</p><p>It is very difficult to rate effectively for the same reasons. Historically, it has been done by spreading the sunscreen on 10 people at the same thickness, then timing how long it takes for their skin to start burning both with and without the product applied.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250828-055926-c20c0c03f5-2.28.1-2/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d151/live/d59b3b40-8a37-11f0-a26a-51aa2f3dec3f.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images A spectator uses an umbrella to shield herself from the sun as another applies sunscreen during the men&#39;s singles third round match between Luxembourg&#39;s Gilles Muller and Spain&#39;s Pablo Carreno Busta on day five of the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne on January 19, 2018."/><span>Getty Images</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Effective and popular sunscreens are hard to get right, experts say</figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>While there are clear guidelines as to what you are looking for, Dr Wong says there is still a lot of variability.
