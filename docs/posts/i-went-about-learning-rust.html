    <h1>I went about learning Rust</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                
                <p>Rust has been on my radar for a <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2015/another-look-at-my-programming-language-arsenal/">long time now</a>,
and about a year ago I finally began allocating some time every week to learning
it.</p>
<p>In this post I&#39;ll provide details on the learning path I&#39;ve followed for Rust,
in the hope that this may prove useful for others. You&#39;ll note
that this isn&#39;t exactly a &#34;Learn X in 24 hours&#34; kind of journey, as it stretches
over a long time period and covers lots of different materials. YMMV.</p>
<p>This learning journey alternates consuming information (mostly books) with
coding activities (some guided by books, some not). In my experience, both are
critical for really learning a language or any other tool deeply, and the
combination of the two is powerful.</p>
<div id="consuming-information">
<h2>Consuming information</h2>
<p>These are the Rust-specific books I&#39;ve read, roughly in chronological order.
There are additional books in the &#34;writing code&#34; section, but those are not
Rust-specific.</p>
<p><strong>Programming Rust</strong> (<a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2021/summary-of-reading-july-september-2021/">link to review</a>)
is the first book I read for an initial introduction to the language.</p>
<p><strong>The Rust Programming Language</strong> - I haven&#39;t read this one cover to cover, but
have skimmed major parts of it, implementing the projects it lists. I&#39;ve also
used it a bunch as a reference since it usually comes up high in Google
rankings; it&#39;s a better reference than <strong>Programming Rust</strong>, IMHO.</p>
<p><strong>Rust in Action</strong> (<a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2022/summary-of-reading-january-march-2022/">link to review</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Rust for Rustaceans</strong> (<a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2022/summary-of-reading-april-june-2022/">link to review</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to these books, I&#39;ve watched a few of John Gjengset&#39;s videos on
YouTube. These are very interesting, and I&#39;ll probably watch more to learn about
specific advanced concepts of Rust, as needed.</p>
<p>Finally, over this year I&#39;ve read a bunch of blog posts about Rust, mostly stuff
that made it to the front pages of HN or r/rust from time to time.</p>
</div>
<div id="writing-code">
<h2>Writing code</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">rustlings</a> - small exercises for
reading and writing snippets of Rust code. Nice concept, though not very
comprehensive. It&#39;s still quite useful when just getting started.</p>
<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> - I <em>love</em> AOC, and the 2021
edition was a great opportunity to practice some Rust. I&#39;ve implemented the
solutions for days 1-18 in Rust, for a total of ~2 KLOC. Solving AOC problems
is a terrific way to learn and practice programming languages. I&#39;m very likely
to tackle AOC 2022 in Rust again, to keep my skills sharp.</p>
<p>The <strong>Ray Tracer Challenge</strong> book (<a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2021/summary-of-reading-october-december-2021/">link to review</a>).
This book is language agnostic, and I picked Rust to implement a simple ray
tracer. Another great way to practice a new language! Almost 4 KLOC for this
one.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting Interpreters</strong> (<a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2022/book-review-crafting-interpreters-by-robert-nystrom/">link to review</a>).
Reimplemented the majority of the <em>clox</em> compiler and VM in Rust, ~2 KLOC.</p>
<p>In addition to these, I&#39;ve done quite a bit of experimentation, writing code to
explore various areas of Rust. Some of this was mentioned in <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/rust">blog posts</a>, but most wasn&#39;t. I estimate there&#39;s
a total of ~6 KLOC of Rust there.</p>
<p>Overall, over these past months I&#39;ve written about 14 KLOC of Rust in the
process of learning and practicing the language.</p>

<div id="what-s-next">
<h2>What&#39;s next</h2>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t call myself a Rust expert, but over this last year I believe I&#39;ve
developed a good understanding and intuition for the language, to the extent
that I would feel confident using it for a production project.</p>
<p>Overall, I like Rust and I&#39;m happy to have added it to my toolbox.
It has issues, and I certainly have opinions about it, but that will have to
wait for a separate post :-)</p>
