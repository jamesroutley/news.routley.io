    <h1>Command Line Tools I Like (2022)</h1>

<p>This is another fairly technical post, and in particular presupposes some enthusiasm for the command line. If that isn’t you, feel free to skip this one!</p>

<p>Despite being primarily an iOS developer, I use the command line quite a bit - I guess old habits from my time as an embedded software intern die hard.
That said, I like a number of modern command line tools, many written in Rust, which are typically blazing fast and have better command-line interfaces than traditional Unix tools.</p>
<p>If you like this list, you might also like Julia Evan’s <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-line-tools/">more comprehensive list</a>!</p>
<h2 id="neovim">neovim</h2>
<p>I have a noted love for vim, but when I’m not using an IDE with a vim mode, I’m actually typically using <a href="https://neovim.io">neovim</a>, alias <code>nvim</code>, which is a modern reimplementation of vim with much less technical debt, a scripting engine based on Lua instead of notoriously-idiosyncratic vimscript, and reasonable defaults like syntax highlighting enabled by default. It also has a full implementation of the <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/">Language Server Protocol</a>, which enables it to have very rich, Visual Studio Code-esque plugins.</p>
<h2 id="fzf">fzf</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/fzf-ctrlr.DNEwGTNf_Kl21s.webp" alt="fzf&amp;#x27;s Ctrl-R behavior in action" width="1600" height="729" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf"><code>fzf</code></a> is a command-line fuzzy finder; given some input, <code>fzf</code> lets you search through the input with a fuzzy matching search term. One use I find for this is my custom <code>git</code> alias for a fancy branch switcher, <code>git b</code>, which lets me fuzzy-search for branch names when I want to switch branches.</p>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/fzf.Dipf4UqV_woRP7.webp" alt="fzf in action" width="556" height="169" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>
<p>It’s also useful on its own! It can helpfully install a replacement for your terminal’s Ctrl+R to fuzzy-search previous commands, as well as a Ctrl+T command to fuzzy-search files in the current directory (although, to be honest, I usually find this option less than effective).</p>
<h2 id="bat">bat</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/bat.DtgX936y_2cmkBM.webp" alt="bat in action" width="1108" height="372" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/bat"><code>bat</code></a> is described as a “<code>cat(1)</code> clone with wings”. <code>cat</code> is technically supposed to be for concatenating text, but more often it’s simply used to print a file to the command line. <code>bat</code> leans into that usage by automatically piping large files into a pager, as well as adding syntax highlighting and <code>git</code> integration. I have <code>cat</code> aliased to <code>bat</code>.</p>
<h2 id="exa">exa</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/exa.ZHpQ3Ose_Z11HahG.webp" alt="exa in action" width="890" height="60" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>
<p><a href="https://the.exa.website">exa</a> is a modern replacement for <code>ls</code>. Although I do think it has more reasonable defaults than <code>ls</code>, I really only use it for one reason: the <a href="https://the.exa.website/features/colours">pretty colours</a>! I have <code>ls</code> aliased to <code>exa</code>.</p>
<h2 id="rg">rg</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/rg.1m6wfl9s_ZuAkTd.webp" alt="rg in action" width="1093" height="120" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a>, aka <code>rg</code>, is a grep tool; it allows you to efficiently search the full text of all files in a directory using regular expressions. Admittedly, it’s often more convenient to use a real IDE’s search function, but <code>rg</code> works everywhere and is <em>blazingly</em> fast.</p>
<h2 id="fd">fd</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/fd.ih_TKBXW_Z1Mhfco.webp" alt="fd in action" width="491" height="108" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/fd"><code>fd</code></a> is a modern replacement for <code>find</code>. Unlike <code>rg</code>, which searches the full text of files, <code>fd</code> just searches filenames. This is useful in large codebases where you know roughly what a file is named but don’t know what directory it lives in. <code>fd</code> has a more intuitive command-line interface than <code>find</code> and even ignores files in your <code>.gitignore</code> by default! I have <code>find</code> aliased to <code>fd</code>.</p>
<p>Notably, some of this behavior is also provided by <code>fzf</code>, but I usually find <code>fd</code> much more effective in actually finding what I want.</p>
<h2 id="delta">delta</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/delta.Htmui8Ik_11SL1S.webp" alt="delta in action" width="1113" height="250" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>
<p>Don’t you wish your command-line <code>git diff</code> was as pretty as Github? Well, now it can be! <a href="https://github.com/dandavison/delta"><code>delta</code></a> makes <code>git diff</code> output much prettier, with word-level highlighting, line numbers, and an optional side-by-side mode.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">tldr</h2>
<p><img src="https://rwblickhan.org/_astro/tldr.B6SViaeT_KS4xl.webp" alt="tldr in action" width="557" height="449" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/></p>
<p><code>tldr</code> is a utility that provides community-maintained help pages for command-line tools, meant to complement traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">man pages</a>, which are typically verbose. Instead, <code>tldr</code> provides a quick cheat-sheet for common use cases. I use the <a href="https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer">tealdeer</a> implementation of <code>tldr</code>.</p>
<h2 id="zoxide">zoxide</h2>
<p>zoxide is a replacement for <code>cd</code>, inspired by <code>z</code>, that lets you jump around quickly. At a basic level, it can completely emulate the behavior of typical <code>cd</code>. However, you can also give it a fuzzy search term, and it will use a “frecency” algorithm to determine which directory, anywhere on your system, to jump to. I have <code>cd</code> aliased to <code>z</code>, the binary for zoxide.</p>
<p>zoxide also has an interactive mode that uses <code>fzf</code> to fuzzy-find recent directory paths. I have that functionality aliased to <code>cdi</code>, though I haven’t gotten in the habit of using it yet.</p>
<h2 id="httpie">httpie</h2>
<p><a href="https://httpie.io/cli">HTTPie</a> is a recent discovery. I don’t need to use <code>curl</code> very often to make HTTP requests, but when I do, it’s always a bit painful to remember the syntax. HTTPie has a much more obvious command-line interface and also built-in support for making HTTPS requests.</p> </article></div>
