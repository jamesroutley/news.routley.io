<p>Miklos Daniel Brody, a cloud engineer, was sentenced to two years in prison and a restitution of $529,000 for wiping the code repositories of his former employer in retaliation for being fired by the company. </p>
<p>First Republic Bank was a commercial bank in the U.S., employing over seven thousand people and having an annual revenue of $6.75 billion. The bank closed on May 1, 2023, and was sold to JPMorgan Chase.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) announcement, Brody was fired on March 11, 2020, from First Republic Bank (FRB) in San Francisco, where he worked as a cloud engineer.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24215622-united-states-v-brody?responsive=1&amp;title=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">court documents</a> state that Brody&#39;s employment was terminated after he violated company policies by connecting a USB drive containing pornography to company computers.</p>
<p>Following his dismissal, Brody allegedly refused to return his work laptop and instead used his still-valid account to access the bank&#39;s computer network and cause damages estimated to be above $220,000</p>
<p>&#34;Among other things, Brody deleted the bank&#39;s code repositories, ran a malicious script to delete logs, left taunts within the bank&#39;s code for former colleagues, and impersonated other bank employees by opening sessions in their names,&#34; describes the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/disgruntled-cloud-engineer-sentenced-two-years-prison-intentionally-damaging-his" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">U.S. DOJ announcement</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;He also emailed himself proprietary bank code that he had worked on as an employee, which was valued at over $5,000.&#34;</p>
<p>Until his access to FRB&#39;s network was eventually terminated on March 12, 2020, Brody had performed the following actions:</p>
<ul><li>Ran a malicious script named &#34;dar.sh&#34; to wipe FRB&#39;s servers</li>
<li>Deleted git logs and git commit history for the particular script</li>
<li>Accessed FRB&#39;s GitHub repository and deleted the hosted code</li>
<li>Inserted &#39;taunts&#39; in the code, including references to &#34;grok&#34;</li>
<li>Impersonated another cloud engineer at FRB to access the firm&#39;s network and make configuration changes</li>
</ul><p>After the incident, Brody falsely reported to the San Francisco Police Department that the FRB-issued laptop had been stolen from his car.</p>
<p>He continued to uphold this story when interviewed by United States Secret Service agents following his arrest in March 2021.</p>
<p>Eventually, in April 2023, Brody pleaded guilty to lying about the laptop and to two charges concerning violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.</p>
<p>In addition to the two-year prison term and the payment of the restitution, Brody will serve three years of supervised release.</p>
