    <h2>Jumping into Recurse</h2>
    <p><em>Originally published 12/16/2021</em></p>

<p>Last Thursday was my last day at my job. In less than 3 weeks, I start Recurse Center.</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t be more excited to jump into it. </p>

<p>For now, I&#39;m reflecting and preparing. I&#39;m trying to soak in that pre-adventure feeling.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve jumped off the beaten path. So it&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve felt this feeling.</p>

<p>After my freshman year of college, I decided I didn&#39;t want to be there. I took a year off. That fall I went to go live in and study villages along the Mekong River. It feels similar to how I felt before that. </p>

<p>After a few years back at college, I decided Mechanical Engineering wasn&#39;t for me. I started taking classes for a major that I would create for myself. It hadn&#39;t even been approved yet. That felt similar too.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a Swedish word that a friend of mine has tattooed on his arm: resfeber. The definition I find online is: &#34;the restless race of the traveler&#39;s heart before the journey begins, when anxiety and anticipation are tangled together.&#34;</p>

<p>I like that word. But that&#39;s never how I&#39;ve felt. The anxiety and restless has always come leading up to the decision. But once I&#39;ve committed and the weeks before the actual jump have come, I don&#39;t feel that way. At least not consciously. It&#39;s much more like the calm, yet slight restlessness of sitting in a waiting room. But like a waiting room, it brings a certain type of presence and awareness. Instead of feeling anxious, I feel more like &#34;yup, this is just what I&#39;m doing.&#39;</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not an exciting place to be. It just means it&#39;s one I&#39;m confident I should be in. </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t be happier to jump into a new adventure.</p>
