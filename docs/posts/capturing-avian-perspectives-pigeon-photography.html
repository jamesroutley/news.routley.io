This project began as an experiment to see if attaching a camera to a pigeon was even possible – but now it has taken on new purpose and meaning. From capturing unique photographs from a new perspective, to potentially assisting in the understanding of pigeons’ behavior and flight patterns, there are countless possibilities for this project.</p><p>First off, I want to express my gratitude towards the pigeon fanciers who have trusted me with their beloved pets. It is through their openness and support that I am able to explore new frontiers within the realm of avian photography. The cultural history of pigeons – from seeing them in flocks over China, to the coops above Cairo’s streets – has always intrigued me and inspired my work.</p><h2>Why attach a camera to pigeons?</h2><p>As I embarked on this journey, the initial goal was simply to determine if it was feasible to capture images through a pigeon’s perspective. However, as the experiment progressed, I began to envision numerous applications for such technology: from publishing stunning collections of photographs in magazines or books, to working with pigeon breeders worldwide to study their birds and their flights more closely. The possibilities are truly endless!</p><p>I travel a lot for my photo assignments, so I would like to meet pigeon fanciers worldwide and work with them to photograph their pigeons and their pigeon’s flights.</p><p>Maybe it is to make a pretty set of photos from a new perspective.  Maybe it is to develop the technology so pigeon fanciers can study and understand their birds in a new way.  Maybe there is an underlying story behind the trends in pigeon racing.  There are a lot of possibilities, and I am open to suggestions.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption>An early test flight at the <em>Pigeon &amp; Bird Supplies of Long Island Auction</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>How did I start pigeon photography?</h2><p>My curiosity about pigeons began almost 20 years ago in China. I saw flocks of tumbling pigeons circling over Kashgar. I spoke enough Uighur to find a coop owner and ask some basic questions. But there was much more to learn. I returned to pigeon coops many times in Egypt. The owners were always welcoming. Their height above the city streets made them a refuge.</p><figure><a href="https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0621-Pigeons-Egypt-0132-scaled-scaled.jpg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" data-placeholder-resp="2500x1667" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%222500%22%20height%3D%221667%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%202500%201667%22%3E%3Cfilter%20id%3D%22c%22%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur%20stdDeviation%3D%2255%22%20%2F%3E%3C%2Ffilter%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%23b4b3bb%22%20d%3D%22M0%200h2500v1660H0z%22%2F%3E%3Cg%20filter%3D%27url(%23c)%27%20fill-opacity%3D%27.5%27%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23505149%22%20fill-opacity%3D%22.5%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22matrix(-2346.14709%20111.66937%20-12.12978%20-254.84375%201829%201452.9)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23eae6ff%22%20fill-opacity%3D%22.5%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22matrix(61.74742%20-517.42853%201692.33132%20201.95464%20760.4%20375.7)%22%2F%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%23b29fff%22%20fill-opacity%3D%22.5%22%20d%3D%22M-151.4%20493.2l2041-429.7L63.5-151.4z%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23414141%22%20fill-opacity%3D%22.5%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22matrix(369.70198%20-76.5616%2043.69493%20210.99483%202328.2%201556.2)%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" decoding="async" width="2500" height="1667" data-src="https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0621-Pigeons-Egypt-0132-scaled-2500x1667.jpg" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0621-Pigeons-Egypt-0132-scaled-2500x1667.jpg 2500w, https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0621-Pigeons-Egypt-0132-scaled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0621-Pigeons-Egypt-0132-scaled-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0621-Pigeons-Egypt-0132-scaled-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0621-Pigeons-Egypt-0132-scaled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/0621-Pigeons-Egypt-0132-scaled-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px"/></a><figcaption>View from a pigeon coop in Imbaba, Cairo</figcaption></figure><p>One of my favorite projects has been this series of <a href="https://www.daviddegner.com/photography/fancy-pigeons/" data-type="post" data-id="813">portraits of pigeons</a>.</p><p>In Egypt, drones are illegal, hard to import, and a good way to get arrested. But there was a moment of openness when I got to thinking about trying to attach a GoPro to a pigeon. Unfortunately, the technology was too heavy, and the bird couldn’t get off the ground.</p><p>But in the last five years, the technology has improved, the cameras have gotten smaller, and the threat of arrest in the U.S. is much lower. So I’m trying again.</p><h2>How to make a pigeon harness?</h2><p>I have gone through several designs for making these harnesses and have found a few tricks to make them strong and light.</p><p>After a few iterations of designs, I have a pigeon harness that works well.  As you can see, nothing is particularly strong because a pigeon in flight doesn’t have a lot of force.  I think of how a bird is engineered with feathers and bones so thin that they easily break, and I design it with a similar philosophy.</p><p>The clasps and elastic are from a fabric store.  The plastic or cardboard chest plate is from the trash.  The back is made from a twisty tie.  I use a bit of sewing for the loops that connect the camera, but I also use super glue and gaffer tape where necessary.</p><p>My original design used a shorter cardboard chest plate, which allowed the camera to flex around too much, so I am trying a longer, stiffer plastic chest plate on this iteration.</p><figure><a href="https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3783-scaled.jpeg"><img data-lazyloaded="1" data-placeholder-resp="3000x2250" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%223000%22%20height%3D%222250%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%203000%202250%22%3E%3Cfilter%20id%3D%22b%22%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur%20stdDeviation%3D%2212%22%20%2F%3E%3C%2Ffilter%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%23333%22%20d%3D%22M0%200h3000v2250H0z%22%2F%3E%3Cg%20filter%3D%22url(%23b)%22%20transform%3D%22translate(5.9%205.9)%20scale(11.71875)%22%20fill-opacity%3D%22.5%22%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23989898%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22rotate(169%2051.6%2048.5)%20scale(50.16834%2045.20216)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23030303%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22matrix(42.91364%2023.39728%20-119.06268%20218.3764%20215.5%20161.3)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%230f0f0f%22%20cx%3D%2220%22%20cy%3D%2297%22%20rx%3D%2224%22%20ry%3D%22255%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%230a0a0a%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22rotate(-155.6%20111.7%20.6)%20scale(56.02002%2026.23055)%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" decoding="async" width="3000" height="2250" data-src="https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3783-scaled.jpeg" alt="" data-srcset="https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3783-scaled.jpeg 3000w, https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3783-1500x1125.jpeg 1500w, https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3783-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3783-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3783-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://www.daviddegner.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_3783-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 3000px) 100vw, 3000px"/></a><figcaption>an early version of pigeon harness at Baron Salcedo’s loft</figcaption></figure><p>I found one rule of thumb repeated many places across the internet “<em>Pigeons weigh between 300 and 500 grams and can carry up to 10 percent of their body weight, or about 30 to 50 grams</em>”</p><p>So I designed the camera+harness to be about 30 grams.
