      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I made a similar post last year at this time and, again, I am in my office on Christmas morning.<p>There are a few days every year that really show which jobs are vital and which can be left aside for a day.  I started my car this morning (-32, -40 with wind chill).  On my way to work I drove past a hospital and a care home, both were manned.  The dairy farm had its lights on.  A cop with his flashers drove past me on the way to some emergency.  The macdonalds drive-through was open too.  I had to be at work by 0600, but I was relieving someone who had been sitting in another office since 1800.  On my computer were the same dozen emails I get every morning, each from someone else who drew the short straw.</p><p>There aren&#39;t many of us on HN that work weekends let alone Christmas morning, but If you too are sitting in a dark office remember that all across the world are millions of other people working the truly important jobs.</p></td></tr>
