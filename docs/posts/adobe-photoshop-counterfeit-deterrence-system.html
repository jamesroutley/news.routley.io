            <p>Adobe® Photoshop® software includes a counterfeit deterrence system (CDS) that prevents the use of the product to illegally duplicate banknotes. As implemented, CDS prevents customers from opening detailed images of banknotes within Photoshop. The CDS technology was commissioned by the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group (CBCDG), a consortium of central banks from around the world. Adobe has included CDS in Photoshop at the request of the CBCDG.</p>
 <p>Laws regarding the reproduction of currency images vary widely from country to country. In some countries, reproduction is permitted for specific purposes given certain restrictions, but in other countries any form of reproduction is considered a crime. For complete information about the rules in a given country, please consult CBCDG’s website, <a disablelinktracking="false" href="https://rulesforuse.org/">www.rulesforuse.org</a>. Where applicable, this website will also indicate where you can obtain legally reproducible currency images, and who to contact for further questions and information.</p>
