<p>After a long wait, the Progress Report is back!  This time it wasn&#39;t so much from a lack of content, but from a lack of <em>content creators</em>.  The past three months had illnesses hit one of our writers and the other had a very challenging move.  Even with these major hurdles jumped, we&#39;re not even close to 100% yet.  It&#39;s been a battle to get caught up with all of the big changes to Dolphin the past couple of months and because of that this report is a <em>tad</em> late.</p>
<p>Needless to say, there&#39;s only one way to start catching up, and that&#39;s to get to digging through the past three months of Notable Changes.  Enjoy!</p>

<h4 id="50-16380-change-default-nus-shop-url-to-dolphins-fake-nus-by-oatmealdome"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-16380/">5.0-16380 - Change default NUS Shop URL to Dolphin&#39;s fake NUS</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/OatmealDome">OatmealDome</a></strong><a href="#50-16380-change-default-nus-shop-url-to-dolphins-fake-nus-by-oatmealdome" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>On the <a href="https://twitter.com/oatmealdome/status/1504206758213947394">16th of March</a> the Wii Nintendo Update Servers (NUS) abruptly went offline. Without them, Wiis can no longer download previously purchased titles, or download critical files needed for setting up your Wii system.  Nintendo refuses to say this is anything more than a temporary maintenance blip, but after two months we&#39;re starting to believe that this is a permanent change.  To our knowledge, the life-support from the Wii Shop has been pulled and the Nintendo Wii is now an offline console.</p>
<p>While it may not seem like much, NUS was an important tool to casual users, the modding scene, and even Dolphin users.  Easy access to official System Files (IOSes) and default channels allowed users to easily setup a clean Wii System that is fully up-to-date without needing a game with a late release date.  If you made a mistake on a modded Wii, you could easily access NUS to get clean copies of IOS files to unbrick your system.  On Dolphin, it made it so users could get a fully up-to-date Wii System Menu setup, complete with channels, with just a few clicks.  For preservation of the Wii experience, NUS made things simple.</p>
<p>More importantly, Wii games <em>require</em> various IOS files in order to run.  We&#39;ve had our run-ins with differences between older IOS behaviors and newer IOS behaviors while wrangling with USB Microphone support.  There are lots of games that either won&#39;t run, or won&#39;t run correctly if they&#39;re missing IOSes.  The good news is that almost every Wii disc title <em>comes</em> with the necessary IOS files to run that game along with a full Wii System Menu and all the default channels.  Whenever you insert a disc into a real Wii, it&#39;ll prompt you to update if there is a missing System File.  Most Dolphin users won&#39;t notice much of a change, as Dolphin has a hack for when a game is launched <em>from the gamelist</em> to ignore missing IOS files.  For anything more complicated, IOS files are also required in Dolphin.</p>
<p>This may seem like a minor issue, but since the servers have gone down, there&#39;s been a huge uptick in issue reports from Dolphin users, along with an increase in bugs relating to incorrectly configured Wii Systems.  A lot of users would simply pull something like that the Mii Channel and the Wii System Menu off of a Wii or a Disc, and think that installing that was enough.  But, without the IOSes required to run the Mii Channel, you&#39;ll either be greeted with a blackscreen, the system menu rebooting, or a notice that the title could not be launched.  Issues like these have been running rampant, and we no longer had an immediate solution that would clean up their issues.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the kicker; Nintendo is still hosting all of these core system files for the Wii, they&#39;re still available to download... from the Wii U Content Delivery Network (CDN)!  It still has all of the Wii&#39;s System Files for some reason.  As far as we know, the Wii U&#39;s Virtual Wii used the Wii NUS.  This isn&#39;t exactly unusual for Nintendo, as the 3DS CDN <em>also</em> has the Wii System Files!</p>
<p>Because of this duplication, this gives us an option to extend the life of the &#34;Perform Online System Update&#34; functionality in Dolphin.  We now have a  <strong>Dolphin</strong> Update Server.  <strong><a href="https://github.com/OatmealDome">OatmealDome</a></strong> created a static page and <strong><a href="https://github.com/delroth">delroth</a></strong> configured the server to act as an intermediary Update Server so that Dolphin can use the Wii U CDN for System Updates.  Because the same files are on the Wii U CDN, all of this shuffling should amount to no noticeable change from the previous behavior for our users.  <em>Perform Online System Update</em> works just how it did before.</p>
<p>Inevitably, the Wii U and 3DS CDNs will eventually go down, but this should buy us time to develop a more permanent solution for when that happens.</p>

<p>During the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2022/02/08/dolphin-progress-report-nov-and-dec-2021-jan-2022/">previous Progress Report</a> the blog writers, JMC47 and MayImilae, were discussing <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2016/09/06/booting-the-final-gc-game/#memory-management-unit-emulation">MMU (Memory Management Unit)</a> titles. And this exchange took place.</p>
