    <h1>Amazon’s Alexa assistant told a child to do a potentially lethal challenge</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="RegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="RegularArticle-articleBody-5-2"><div><p>Alexa, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN" target="_blank">Amazon&#39;s</a> virtual assistant, is not designed to endanger human lives but that&#39;s exactly what it did over the weekend when it told a 10-year-old girl to touch a live electrical plug with a penny.</p><p>The suggestion was given out via an Echo smart speaker after the girl asked Alexa for a &#34;challenge to do.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet, then touch a penny to the exposed prongs,&#34; Alexa said.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC on Wednesday that the error had been fixed.</p><p>Kristin Livdahl, the girl&#39;s mother who reportedly lives in the U.S., described the incident in a tweet Sunday, which included <a href="https://twitter.com/klivdahl/status/1475220450598924297?s=20" target="_blank">a screenshot of the event as it appeared in the Alexa smartphone app.</a></p><p>&#34;We were doing some physical challenges, like laying down and rolling over holding a shoe on your foot, from a [physical education] teacher on YouTube earlier,&#34; Livdahl wrote in another tweet. &#34;Bad weather outside. She just wanted another one.&#34;</p><p>It was then that Alexa suggested the girl attempt the challenge that it had &#34;found on the web.&#34; Alexa pulled the challenge from an online news publication called Our Community Now. The news website did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC and it was not clear how it originally reported on the foolhardy challenge.</p><p>&#34;I was right there when it happened and we had another good conversation about not trusting anything from the internet or Alexa,&#34; the mother said.</p><p>The potentially lethal challenge, which Alexa seemingly failed to vet, started appearing on social media platforms including TikTok around a year ago. It&#39;s dangerous because metals conduct electricity and inserting metal coins into a plug socket can result in violent electric shocks and fires, with some <a href="https://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/18212070.firefighters-warning-teens-penny-challenge-tiktok/" target="_blank">reports of people losing fingers and hands from taking the challenge.</a></p></div><div><p>&#34;Alexa is designed to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information to customers,&#34; the Amazon spokesperson told CNBC. &#34;As soon as we became aware of this error, we took swift action to fix it.&#34;</p><p>Amazon did not immediately elaborate on what the &#34;swift action&#34; was.  </p><p>Artificial intelligence expert Gary Marcus said Wednesday on Twitter that the event shows how AI systems still lack common sense.</p><p>&#34;No current AI is remotely close to understanding the everyday physical or psychological world,&#34; Marcus later told CNBC via Twitter. &#34;What we have now is an approximation to intelligence, not the real thing, and as such it will never really be trustworthy. We are going to need some fundamental advances — not just more data — before we can get to AI we can trust.&#34;</p></div></div></div>
