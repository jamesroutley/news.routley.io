    <h1>Ex-OpenAI board member reveals what led to Sam Altman&#39;s brief ousting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Former OpenAI board member <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-openai-board-members-challenge-self-governance-sam-altman-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Helen Toner</a> revealed explosive new details about what led to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-return-openai-board-directors2024-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">CEO Sam Altman&#39;s brief ousting</a> in November. <strong></strong>In an interview with Bilawal Sidhu on <a target="_blank" href="https://link.chtbl.com/TEDAI" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">&#34;The Ted AI Show,&#34;</a> which aired Tuesday, Toner said Altman had lied to the board multiple times. </p><div><p>She said that Altman was &#34;withholding information&#34; and &#34;misrepresenting things that were happening in the company&#34; for years.</p><p>Toner — one of the board members who voted to kick Altman out — alleged Altman also lied to the board by keeping them in the dark about the company&#39;s ownership structure. </p><p>Altman keeping that from the board &#34;really damaged our ability to trust him&#34; and that the board was &#34;already talking pretty seriously about whether we needed to fire him&#34; in October, she said.</p><p>OpenAI didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. </p><p>Toner — currently a director of strategy at the Centre for Security and Emerging Technology at Georgetown — alleges the OpenAI chief also gave board members &#34;inaccurate information about the small number of formal safety processes&#34; OpenAI had in place.  </p><p>She said that made it &#34;basically impossible&#34; for the board to understand if the safety measures were sufficient or if any changes were needed.</p><p>She said there were other individual examples, but ultimately, the board concluded that &#34;we just couldn&#39;t believe things that Sam was telling us, and that&#39;s a completely unworkable place to be in as a board.&#34; </p><p>But Altman&#39;s ouster didn&#39;t last long.</p><p>As staff threatened to quit and speculation swirled that Microsoft may poach Altman&#39;s team from OpenAI and hire him directly, the company&#39;s board brought back Altman as CEO less than a week later.</p><p>Toner resigned from her role as an OpenAI board member less than two weeks after Altman returned as CEO. </p></div></div>
