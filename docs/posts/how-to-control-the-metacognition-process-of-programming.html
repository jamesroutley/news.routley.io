    <h1>How to control the metacognition process of programming?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>by Laurence Chen</p>
<p>There is a famous quote: Programming is thinking, not typing. After doing this job long enough, sometimes, I feel I am doing too much typing. No matter whether humans are thinking or typing, they use their brains, so I believe the word “typing” is a metaphor: typing refers to the kind of activities that we are doing unconsciously, doing through our muscle memory, not through our deliberate attention. Many of us, with enough experience, use quite a lot of muscle memory. On the other hand, do we use enough thinking when we need to?</p>
<p>We, humans, make a lot of decisions in our daily life: a decision like buying a car, or a decision like naming a function. Evolution makes us become the kind of animal that we can delegate certain parts of decisions down to our subconscious minds, which we may refer to as the background process in our brain. Therefore, we can focus our mind on something that matters. Here is the problem: what if the subconscious mind is not doing a good job? Most of the time, it is not a big deal, and escalating the issue back to foreground thinking can solve it. For example, when you press <code>&lt;localleader&gt; e e</code> to evaluate a form, but mistakenly evaluating the wrong form. You detect that, then you use your foreground thinking to decide what to do next. However, sometimes, when you know that the subconscious mind can not handle the job well before you begin the job, what can you do to prevent your subconscious mind from taking over control? Do we have any mechanism similar to the linux command <code>fg</code>, which can bring a process from background to foreground?</p>
<p>I feel somewhat embarrassed to confess that, although I have been programming for ten years, sometimes when I encounter a bug, my brain first goes to the panic mode for hours, and then goes back to the analytic mode. Why? My theory is that when I developed my skills as a junior developer, I solved my problems in the panic mode: crazy goolging, trial and error, and etc. Year over year experience has trained my behaviors and muscle memory to debug in the panic mode. However, now I want to fix that. There are two methods that can help me control my subconscious mind:</p>
<ol>
<li>Explain the code to another person. (Rubber Duck Method)</li>
<li>Ask myself some pre-made questions. (Drucker Method)</li></ol>
<h3 id="remote-work-taught-me-the-rubber-duck-method">Remote work taught me the Rubber Duck Method</h3>
<p>When working with the Gaiwan team, we are working fully remotely. Sometimes, when I want to find someone to discuss, I need to wait. Several times, when I encounter a bug and I want to ask for help, I write down all the details about the code, the environment, and how I have attempted to solve the bug. After I paste my bug report in the Gaiwan’s communication channel and take a 15 minutes break, the magical thing just happens: the muse comes to my mind. I solve it quickly and edit the message that I have already posted. The Rubber Duck Method really works!</p>
<p>Actually, I think the idea of thinking by explaining has different names: Rubber Duck, Literate programming, Feynman Technique, etc. They are all similar things.</p>
<h3 id="right-question-is-like-the-fg-command-on-your-brain">Right question is like the fg command on your brain</h3>
<p>Now, when I encounter a bug, I ask myself <a shape="rect" href="https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2021-09-21-the-obstacles-of-effectively-debugging">three questions</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do I use the scientific method to chase this bug?</li>
<li>Do I have the correct system view of this problem scope?</li>
<li>Do I have the necessary telemetry tool?</li></ol>
<p>I have similar issues when I write a function, write a module, or prepare the deployment: <strong>Typing too much and thinking too little</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are some questions I made for myself, but still alpha version:</p>
<h3 id="questions-for-writing-a-function">Questions for writing a function:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Should I keep command and query separate?</li>
<li>Do I write the <strong>contingent designs</strong> for errors like <code>try/catch</code> and logs?</li>
<li>Do I write the <strong>preventive designs</strong> for errors like <code>pre</code> condition or <code>assert</code>?</li>
<li>Should the function name describe <a shape="rect" href="https://leanpub.com/elementsofclojure"><strong>the purpose</strong></a>?</li>
<li>Do I add some suitable doc strings on functions?</li></ol>
<h3 id="questions-for-writing-a-module">Questions for writing a module:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Should I explicitly specify the APIs of this module, and make these APIs apparently different from internal functions?</li>
<li>Has all the unnecessary dead code been removed?</li>
<li>Do I design or use suitable Clojure records to model some <strong>immutable concepts</strong> of the domain problem?</li></ol>
<h3 id="questions-for-integration-and-deployment">Questions for integration and deployment</h3>
<ol>
<li>Do I add appropriate tests on domain functions?</li>
<li>Do I design appropriate feedback messages on setup scripts?</li>
<li>Can some manual setup steps be replaced with automation scripts?</li></ol>
<p>The question of using records needs more explanation: For some immutable concepts like <a shape="rect" href="https://lambdaisland.com/blog/27-02-2017-announcing-lambdaisland-uri">uri</a>, <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/deja-fu">date</a>, or <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/embedkit/blob/main/src/lambdaisland/embedkit.clj#L74">connection</a>, to represent them with some well-designed records will make the implementation details hidden in the proper layer. These immutable concepts tend to have a fixed set of related operations, which can be modeled using <code>Protocol</code>.</p>
<p>I found that both explaining or asking questions can help me effectively. They help me train my subconscious mind and the more analytic thinking I use the better divergent thinking I get. Are you also using some questions? Tell us your <code>fg</code> command.</p></div><div><article><p>Posted Thu, 07 Apr 2022 11:57:28</p><div>

<p>Have you ever looked at your REPL and asked yourself “What am I supposed to understand from this?”. This is not just a junior thought, but one also common to more advanced programmers. What makes it hard is that Clojure error messages are not very informative. This is why a lot of work was put into improving these error messages.</p>
<p>The errors seem a bit strange at first, but you can get used to them and develop a sense of where to look. Then, handling errors will be much less difficult.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Thu, 10 Mar 2022 11:34:31</p><div>

<p>Years ago when I was still a programming baby, I read about a concept, a way of
thinking about code, and it has greatly influenced how I think about code to
this day. I’ve found it tremendously helpful when thinking about API design, or
how to compose and layer systems.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I’ve found it hard at times to explain succinctly what I mean.
I’ve also realized that I’ve built up my own mental framework around this
concept that goes I think beyond the original formulation. So, in the hope of
inspiring someone else, to maybe elicit some interesting discussion, and also
just so that I have a convenient place on the web to link to, here’s my take on
“policy” vs “mechanism”.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Thu, 27 Jan 2022 17:36:39</p><div>

<p>It’s easy to forget the Java Development Kit is, in fact, a kit.  Many Clojure
developers, myself included, rarely work with commands like <code>java</code> directly,
instead using <code>lein</code>, <code>boot</code>, or <code>clojure</code>. Often we don’t even use the Java
standard library directly in favor of idiomatic wrappers.</p>
<p>There are a lot of advantages to staying in the Clojure level. Often, Clojure-specific
tools ergonomically support common practices like live-reloading, understand
Clojure data structures, and can tuck away some of the intermediate layers of
Clojure itself that aren’t a part of your application.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Thu, 13 Jan 2022 12:26:18</p><div>

<p>In <a shape="rect" href="https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2021-11-03-making-nrepl-cider-more-dynamic-1">part 1</a> I
set the stage with a summary of what nREPL is and how it works, how
editor-specific tooling like CIDER for Emacs extends nREPL through middleware,
and how that can cause issues and pose challenges for users. Today we’ll finally
get to the “dynamic” part, and how it can help solve some of these issues.</p>
<p>To sum up again what we are dealing with: depending on the particulars of the
nREPL client (i.e. the specific editor you are using, or the presence of
specific tooling like <code>refactor-clj</code>), or of the project (shadow-cljs vs vanilla
cljs), certain nREPL middleware needs to present for things to function as they
should. When starting the nREPL server you typically supply it with a list of
middlewares to use. This is what plug-and-play “jack-in” commands do behind the
scenes. For nREPL to be able to load and use those middlewares they need to be
present on the classpath, in other words, they need to be declared as
dependencies. This is the second part that jack-in takes care of.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Wed, 03 Nov 2021 16:59:10</p><div>
<p><em>This first part is a recap about nREPL, nREPL middleware, and some of the
issues and challenges they pose. We’ll break up the problem and look at
solutions in part 2.</em></p>
<p>The REPL is a Clojurists <a shape="rect" href="https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2017-12-29-the-bare-minimum-clojure-mayonnaise">quintessential
tool</a>,
it’s what we use to do Interactive Development, the hallmark of the LISP style
of development.</p>
<p>In Interactive Development (more commonly but somewhat imprecisely referred to
as REPL-driven development), the programmer’s editor has a direct connection
with the running application process. This allows evaluating pieces of code in
the context of a running program, directly from where the code is written (and
so not in some separate “REPL place”), inspecting and manipulating the innards
of the process. This is helped along by the dynamic nature of Clojure in which
any var can be redefined at any point, allowing for quick incremental and
iterative experimentation and development.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:27:11</p><div>

<p>A key concept when working with Clojure is “the classpath”, a concept which we
inherit from Clojure’s host language Java. It’s a sequence of paths that Clojure
(or Java) checks when looking for a Clojure source file (<code>.clj</code>), a Java Class
file (<code>.class</code>), or other resources. So it’s a lookup path, conceptually similar
to the <code>PATH</code> in your shell, or the “library path” in other dynamic languages.</p>
<p>The classpath gets set when starting the JVM by using the <code>-cp</code> (or
<code>-classpath</code>) command line flag.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Wed, 18 Aug 2021 16:00:41</p><div>

<p>Recently, I was helping a coworker debug an issue with loading a Clojure
dependency from a Git repository. (If you don’t know you can do this; it’s very
handy. <a shape="rect" href="https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli#_using_git_libraries">Here’s</a> a
guide.) I realized that there were really two Clojures at play: the Clojure that
<code>clojure</code> was running to generate the classpath and the Clojure that was used by
the actual Clojure program.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, there are really three things we might mean when we say
“Clojure”:</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Fri, 23 Jul 2021 14:28:10</p><div>

<p>Last month marked the five year anniversary of Lambda Island. Five years since I
quit my job, built a video platform, and figured out how to put together
tutorial videos. It’s been quite a ride. All this time I’ve been fortunate to be
part of the Clojure community, to watch it grow and evolve, and to help
individuals and companies to navigate these waters.</p>
<p>I learned some hard lessons along the way. Like how hard it is to bootstrap an
educational content business catering to a niche audience, or how lonely and
stressful it can be in business to go it alone.</p>
<p>And with these lessons came changes. I started doing more consulting work again.
To some extent it was a necessity, but it also provided me with an opportunity
to get involved with many Clojure projects out there in the wild. To work with
talented individuals, to learn what amazing things people were doing, and to
help shape these companies, products, and the greater narrative around Clojure
as a technology and community.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Fri, 04 Jun 2021 15:53:45</p><div>

<p>This was my question too. I love cheese, but I wanted to find a good vegan cheese replacement for my breakfast sandwich.
This wasn’t a fun journey, all the vegan cheese substitutes weren’t like the real deal!
After a talk with one of my vegan friends, he told me that my point of view over cheese replacement in the sandwich was wrong.
Instead of searching for a good and tasty vegan cheese replacement, just replace it with an avocado.
Avocado is a good replacement for your morning sandwich without the compromising that you would do with tasteless vegan cheese substitutes.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Mon, 05 Apr 2021 18:09:55</p><div>

<p>We’re always excited when someone new contributes a fix, test, documentation update, or even a major new feature to our open source projects.
If you’re new to programming, open source projects are a great way to get experience working on a larger project.
If you’re not so new, they can be an opportunity to try a new technology or work on a kind of software you usually don’t get a chance to.
Either way, it’s rewarding to help out your fellow users or developers—these issues are for Kaocha, one of the most popular and advanced Clojure test runners.</p>
<p>But open source can also be intimidating. If you haven’t been sure where to start, then this post is for you! We’ve outlined the process step by step, and we’re here to support you every step of the way.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Mon, 28 Sep 2020 09:23:21</p><div>
<p>In an <a shape="rect" href="https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2020-06-12-logging-in-clojure-making-sense-of-the-mess">earlier post</a>
I tried to map out the Clojure/Java logging landscape a bit, so people can make
an informed choice about how to set up logging for their application. There are
several solutions out there with different trade-offs, and recently both <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre">Timbre</a>
and <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/BrunoBonacci/mulog">mulog</a> have had some new releases. However until further notice the default
logging setup in the “Lambda Island Stack” remains pedestal.log on the backend,
and Glögi at the front.</p>
<p>This blog post is a bit of practical advice on how to make good use of logging,
with the focus on these two libraries, which both provide the same API, just for
a different platform.</p>
<p>This API consists of a number of macros corresponding with the different log
levels, which all take key-value pairs as arguments.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Tue, 28 Jul 2020 11:32:26</p><div>
<p>Yesterday Vlaaad wrote a pretty cool blog post titled <a shape="rect" href="https://vlaaad.github.io/tools-cli-in-10-lines-of-code">Alternative to tools.cli
in 10 lines of code</a>.
It’s a great read and a very cool hack. It uses <code>read-string</code> to parse command
line arguments, resolves symbols, and invokes the first symbol/function, passing
in the rest of the parsed arguments. In other words: it’s the most
straightforward way to translate a command line invocation into a Clojure
function call.</p>
<p>The benefits are illustrated well in the post. It removes all possible friction.
Want to add a new subcommand? Just add a function. Adding CLI arguments and
options equals adding arguments and options to said function.</p>
<p>It’s actually not too different from what people do in shell scripts sometimes.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Fri, 12 Jun 2020 10:10:45</p><div>

<p>Logging seems like a simple enough concept. It’s basically <code>println</code> with a
couple of extra smarts. And yet it can be oh so confounding. Even when you
literally do not care a sigle bit about logging you may still be sent down a
rabbit hole because of warnings of things that are or aren’t on the classpath.
What even is a classpath?</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Fri, 05 Jun 2020 13:46:30</p><div>
<p><a shape="rect" href="https://twitter.com/flpbar">Felipe</a> and I have been busy again, read all about
what we’ve been up to in this month’s Lambda Island Open Source update.</p>
<p>We currently have two major projects we are working to get out: Regal and
Kaocha-cljs2. They are both still a work in progress, but we’ve again made some
good progress this month. Regal is not officially out yet but is at the stage
where people can safely start incorporating it into their projects.
Kaocha-cljs2 is a big undertaking, but we’re splitting this work into smaller
self-contained pieces, and two of those saw their first release this month: Chui
and Funnel.</p>

<p>With people across the globe isolating themselves it feels sometimes like time
is standing still, but looking back it’s been a busy month again for the folks
here at Lambda Island. Besides all the maintenance releases we
shipped some new features for
<a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/uri">lambdaisland.uri</a>, our JS logging library
<a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/glogi">Glögi</a>, and a new micro-library,
<a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/edn-lines">edn-lines</a>. We also have some
exciting work in progress, including a brand new browser-based test runner for
ClojureScript, written with shadow-cljs in mind.</p>
<h2 id="funding">Funding</h2>
<p>A big shout goes out to two of our clients,
<a shape="rect" href="http://nextjournal.com/">Nextjournal</a> and <a shape="rect" href="https://pitch.com">Pitch</a>. They have
made a lot of this work possible either by funding projects directly, or by
dogfooding our tools and libraries and giving us an opportunity to improve them.

<p>Back in December I wrote about a coding pattern that I’ve been using more and more often in my work, which I dubbed “<a shape="rect" href="https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2019-12-16-advent-of-parens-16-coffee-grinders">Coffee Grinders</a>”. My thoughts around this were still gelling at the time, and so the result was a meandering semi-philosophical post that didn’t really get to the point, and that didn’t seem to resonate that much with people.</p>
<p>Some of the responses I got were “just use functions” or “sounds like a finite-state machine”, which makes it clear that I was not in fact making myself clear.</p>
<p>Having continued to encounter and apply this pattern I’d like to present a more concise, semi-formal definition of coffee grinders.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Mon, 03 Feb 2020 14:33:01</p><div>

<p>I’ve been a big fan of SVG since the early 2000’s. To me it’s one of the great
victories of web standards. Mind you, browser support has taken a long time to catch up.
Back then you had to embed your SVG file with an <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag, and support for the
many cool features and modules was limited and inconsistent.</p>
<p>These days of course you can drop an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> tag straight into your HTML. What a
joy! And since the SVG can now go straight into the DOM, you can draw your SVG
with React/Reagent. Now there’s a killer combo.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Sat, 21 Dec 2019 14:04:39</p><div>

<p>Over the last year or so I’ve found myself using some variations on a
certain pattern when modelling processes in Clojure. It’s kind of like a
 event loop, but adapted to the functional, immutable nature of
Clojure. For lack of a better name I’m calling these coffee grinders. (The
analogy doesn’t even really work but the kid needs to have a name.)</p>
<p>Since I saw <a shape="rect" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJnsXUVsr7w">Avdi Grimm’s OOPS Keynote</a>

<p>I’m a strong believer in pair programming. It can be intense and exhausting, and

<p>Recently I led a workshop for a client to help them improve their development
process, and we talked a lot about <a shape="rect" href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>, a
book released by Basecamp earlier this year that talks about <em>their</em> process.
You can read it for free on-line, and I can very much recommend doing so. It’s
not a long read and there are a ton of good ideas in there.</p>
<p>One of these ideas has also become a feature in Basecamp, namely hill charts.
These provide a great way to communicate what stage a piece of work is in. Are
you still going uphill, figuring things out and discovering new work, or are you
going downhill, where it’s mostly clear what things will look like, and you’re
just executing what you discovered?</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Mon, 09 Dec 2019 14:42:00</p><div>

<p>Clojure has this great feature called Dynamic Vars, it lets you create variables
which can be dynamically bound, rather than lexically. Lexical (from Ancient
Greek λέξις (léxis) <em>word</em>) in this case means “according to how it is written”.
<code>let</code> bindings for instance are lexical.</p>
<pre><code>(defn hello [x]
  (str &#34;hello &#34; x))

(defn greetings []
  (str &#34;greetings&#34; foo)) ;; *error*

(let [foo 123]
  (hello foo)
  (greetings))

<p>I’ve always been a big UNIX fan. I can hold my own in a shell script, and I
really like the philosophy of simple tools working on a uniform IO abstraction.
Uniform abstractions are a huge enabler in heterogenous systems. Just think of
Uniform Resource Locators and Identifier (URLs/URIs), one of the
<a shape="rect" href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">cornerstones</a> of
the web as we know it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately since coming to Clojure I feel like I’ve lost of some of that
power. I’m usually developing against a Clojure process running inside (or at
least connected to) my trusty editor, and the terminal plays second fiddle. How
do I pipe things into or out of that?</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Sat, 07 Dec 2019 19:43:35</p><div>

<p><code>doto</code> is a bit of an oddball in the Clojure repertoire, because Clojure is a
functional language that emphasizes pure functions and immutabilty, and <code>doto</code>
only makes sense when dealing with side effects.</p>
<p>To recap, <code>doto</code> takes a value and a number of function or method call forms. It
executes each form, passing the value in as the first argument. At the end of
the ride it returns the original value.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Fri, 06 Dec 2019 12:09:03</p><div>

<p>Part of what I want to do in this series is simply point at some of the useful

First though we’ll look at a classic: netcat!</p>
<p>I’ve been using netcat for years, it’s such a great tool. It simply sets up a
TCP connection and connects it to STDIN/STDOUT. Pretty straightforward. I’ve
been using it more and more though because of Clojure’s socket REPL.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Sun, 01 Dec 2019 21:46:44</p><div>

<p>An interesting aspect of the Clojure community, for better or for worse, is that
it forms a kind of linguistic bubble. We use certain words that aren’t
particularly common in daily speech, like “accretion”, or use innocuous little
words to refer to something very specific. Even a simple word like “simple” is
no longer that simple.</p>
<p>We can thank Rich Hickey for this. He seems to care a great deal about language,
and is very careful in picking the words he uses in his code, documentation, and
in his talks.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Mon, 25 Nov 2019 19:14:00</p><div>

stream of income, and made it easy for me to unplug at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Lambda Island was, as the Dutch expression goes, “a different pair of sleeves”.
I really underestimated what switching to a one-man product business in a niche
market would mean, and within months I was struggling with symptoms of burnout,
so most of year one was characterised by trying to keep things going and stay
afloat financially, while looking after myself and trying to get back to a good

<p>When learning a programming language we rarely read the reference documentation front to back. Instead someone might follow some   tutorials, and look at sample code, until they’re confident enough to start a little project for practice.</p>
<p>From that point on the learning process is largely “just in time”, looking up exactly the things you need to perform the task at hand. As this goes on you might start to recognize some patterns, some internal logic that allows you to “intuit” how one part of the language works, based on experience with another part.</p>
<p>Developing this “intuition” — understanding this internal logic — is key to using a language effectively, but occasionally our intuition will be off. Some things are simply not obvious, unless someone has explained them to us.

<p><em>tl;dr: both Java and JavaScript have trouble dealing with unicode characters from <a shape="rect" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Supplementary_Multilingual_Plane">Supplementary Planes</a>, like emoji 😱💣.</em></p>
<p>Today I started working on the next feature of <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/uri">lambdaisland/uri</a>, URI normalization. I worked test-first, you’ll get to see how that went in the next Lambda Island episode.</p>
<p>One of the design goals for this library is to have 100% parity between Clojure and ClojureScript. Learn once, use anywhere. The code is all written in <code>.cljc</code> files, so it can be treated as either Clojure or ClojureScript. Only where necessary am I using a small amount of reader conditionals.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Thu, 25 May 2017 13:55:39</p></article><article><p>Posted Wed, 17 May 2017 13:58:50</p><div>
<p>Did you ever fix a bug in an open source library, and then had to wait until the maintainer released an updated version?</p>
<p>It’s happened to me many times, the latest one being <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/metabase/toucan">Toucan</a>. I had run into a limitation, and found out that there was already an <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/metabase/toucan/issues/6">open ticket</a>. It wasn’t a big change so I decided to <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/metabase/toucan/pull/10">dive in and address it</a>. Just a little yak shave so I could get on with my life.</p>
<p>Now this pull request needs to be reviewed, and merged, and eventually be released to Clojars, but ain’t nobody got time for that stuff. No sir-ee.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Sat, 13 May 2017 11:14:34</p><div>
<p>One year ago to date I launched Lambda Island, a service that offers high quality video tutorials on web development with Clojure and ClojureScript. It’s been quite a ride. In this post I want to look back at the past year, provide some insight into how this experience has been for me, and give you a glimpse of what the future has in store.</p>
<p>This story really starts in December 2015. After three years of doing contract work for <a shape="rect" href="http://ticketsolve.com">Ticketsolve</a> I decided it was time for a change. I have been self-employed for many years, but I knew that sooner or later I wanted to try my hand at selling a product, rather than selling my time.</p>
<p>In January and February I took some time for soul-searching, and recharging. I went to speak at RubyConf Australia, and got to hang out with some old friends around Australia and New Zealand. Once back in Berlin I got busy creating Lambda Island.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Tue, 02 May 2017 16:49:32</p><div>
<p>In the
<a shape="rect" href="https://lambdaisland.com/episodes/building-cli-apps-with-lumo-part-1">two most recent</a>   <a shape="rect" href="https://lambdaisland.com/episodes/building-cli-apps-with-lumo-part-2">Lambda Island episodes</a> I
covered in-depth how to create command line utilities based
on <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/anmonteiro/lumo">Lumo</a>, how to combine them with third
party libraries, and how to deploy them to <a shape="rect" href="http://npmjs.com/">npmjs.com</a>.</p>
<p>However there’s a different way to create tools with ClojureScript and
distribute them through NPM, without relying on Lumo. In this blog post I want
to quickly demostrate how to do just that.</p>
<p>To recap, Lumo is a ClojureScript environment based on Node.js, using
bootstrapped (self-hosted) ClojureScript. This means the ClojureScript compiler,
which is written in Clojure and runs on the JVM, is used to compile itself to
JavaScript. This way the JVM is no longer needed, all you need is a JavaScript
runtime to compile and run ClojureScript code, which in this case is provided by
Node.js. On top of that Lumo uses <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/nexe/nexe">nexe</a>, so Lumo
can be distributed as a single compact and fast executable binary.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Mon, 27 Feb 2017 08:35:05</p><div>
<p>I just released <code>lambdaisland/uri</code>, a pure Clojure/ClojureScript URI library. It is available <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/uri">on Github</a> and <a shape="rect" href="http://clojars.org/lambdaisland/uri">Clojars</a>.</p>
<p>This is a small piece of the code base that powers <a shape="rect" href="https://lambdaisland.com">lambdaisland.com</a>. It’s inspired by Ruby’s <a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/sporkmonger/addressable">Addressable::URI</a>, the most solid URI implementation I’ve seen to date, although it only offers a small part of the functionality that library offers.</p>
<p>It’s written in pure Clojure/ClojureScript, with only minimal use of <code>.cljc</code> reader conditionals to smooth over differences in regular expression syntax, and differences in core protocols. It does not rely on any URI functionality offered by the host, such as <code>java.net.URL</code>, so it’s usable across all current and future Clojure implementations (Clojure, ClojureScript, ClojureCLR).</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Sat, 11 Feb 2017 11:10:43</p><div>
<p>Up until recently, to use re-frame subscriptions in Reagent views, you had to
use a form-2 component.</p>
<p>A form-2 component is a function that returns another function, which does the
actual rendering of the component to hiccup. In contrast, a form-1 component
renders the hiccup directly.</p>
<pre><code>;; form-1
(defn todo-item [todo]
  [:div.view
   [todo-checkbox (:id todo) (:completed todo)]
   [:label {:unselectable &#34;on&#34;} title]
   [:button.destroy {:on-click #(dispatch [:todos/remove (:id todo)])}]])

;; form-2
(defn todo-item [todo]
  (fn [todo]
    [:div.view
     [todo-checkbox (:id todo) (:completed todo)]
     [:label {:unselectable &#34;on&#34;} title]
     [:button.destroy {:on-click #(dispatch [:todos/remove (:id todo)])}]]))
</code></pre></div></article><article><p>Posted Thu, 02 Feb 2017 12:37:43</p><div>
<p>This one had been sitting on my drive for a while, I thought it would be nice to share it with y’all. It’s a recording from a talk I did at the <a shape="rect" href="https://www.meetup.com/Clojure-Berlin/events/233941806/">Clojure Berlin Meetup last October</a>, about the various performance tricks that React, Reagent, and re-frame employ to make sure your apps are as spiffy as can be.</p>
<p>The <a shape="rect" href="http://arnebrasseur.net/talks/2016-react-fast/#1">slides are on-line</a> as well.</p>

<p>This weekend it’s <a shape="rect" href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a> again, the world’s longest
running game jam. The idea is that, alone or with a team, you build a game in a
weekend based on a certain theme.</p>
<p>We got a little team together here in Berlin, and so I’ve been reviewing what
options there are for someone wanting to build a game in Clojure or
Clojurescript.</p>
<p>The good news is there are plenty of options, as you’ll see from the list below.
You can do desktop games, browser based games with canvas or webgl, and you can
even create <a shape="rect" href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity 3D</a> games, all from your comfortable
Clojure parentheses.</p></div></article><article><p>Posted Sat, 01 Oct 2016 11:03:35</p><div>

<p>Elm and other statically typed languages have a great feature called Union Types
(also called Sum Types or Algebraic Data Types).</p>
<p>Here’s an example taken from Elm. Suppose your system used to represent users as
integers, maybe just an auto-incrementing primary key, but then switched to
UUIDs represented as strings.</p>
<p>To correctly model this situation, you need a way to create a type that can be
either an integer or a string, that’s what union types give you.</p></div></article></div></div>
