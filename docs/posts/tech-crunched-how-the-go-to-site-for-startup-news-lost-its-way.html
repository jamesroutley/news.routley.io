Their idea at the time was to invest in Web 2.0, meaning the nascent world of web apps. They built a few products at the time. One was an online classified ad service called Edge.io that was supposed to mimic Craigslist on every site on the web. The other was a startup tracking service called TechCrunch that aimed to review every Web 2.0 site popping up on the nascent Internet. Teare, for his part, focused on the startup while Arrington focused on the blog.</span></p><p><span>At the time, the media industry was being upended by bloggers who moved faster and wrote off-the-cuff stories about nearly everything, essentially beating print magazines to every punch. Along the way, they destroyed the </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/12/17/death-to-the-embargo/" rel="">embargo system</a><span>, built the first influencers, gave rise to </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_Swisher" rel="">hagiographic access journalism</a><span>, turned true reviews into affiliate marketing plays, savaged advertising revenue, and threw traditional journalism into a death spiral whose crash is currently finalizing itself around the world. But, at the time, they were pretty cool.</span></p><p>Arrington spent most of his waking hours publishing Web 2.0 stories and asking his VC buddies for scoops. He monetized the site by selling square ads on the side of the page for a few thousand dollars a month, and emblazoned there were early come-ons for the same sites Arrington was reviewing. Eventually, those sponsors paid enough money to expand the site into multiple topics, including MobileCrunch and my site, CrunchGear.</p><p>I started CrunchGear for Mike in 2006. At this point, TechCrunch had eclipsed most of the rest of Archimedes Ventures, leaving Arrington to spend nearly every waking hour on TC. To cater to a global audience, he would stay up until three or four writing scoops about exciting new services like TWTR and Spotify and yelling loudly at Mark Hendrickson, a biology major who was imprisoned in Mike’s Palo Alto home. When I came by for my initial interview, I had to wake Mike up and he took me to CostCo to buy stuff for a party he was holding that night.</p><p>If you want to understand what life was like back then, blogger Om Malik suffered a heart attack from overwork (and too many cigars) while Arrington himself told the NYT that his lifestyle was awful:</p><p><em><span>“I haven’t died yet,” said Michael Arrington, the founder and co-editor of </span><a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/" rel="">TechCrunch</a><span>, a popular technology blog. The site has brought in millions in advertising revenue, but there has been a hefty cost. Mr. Arrington says he has gained 30 pounds in the last three years, developed a severe sleeping disorder and turned his home into an office for him and four employees. “At some point, I’ll have a nervous breakdown and be admitted to the hospital, or something else will happen.”</span></em></p><p><em>“This is not sustainable,” he said.</em></p><p>TechCrunch was the definitive startup news site. To get on the front page - however briefly - meant 10,000 new signups to your service and countless calls from Valley VCs. That was TC’s power: it could make or break a site. This gave us silly kids an inordinate amount of power (and eventually led me to suffer a fairly debilitating depression) because startup founders needed us to close out their rounds. “Get a TC story,” the VCs would say, and founders would listen. One pair of Dutch entrepreneurs walked into Mike’s house with coffee, entering his bedroom in hopes of convincing him to write about whatever they were flogging. Legend has it that at one point an irate German entrepreneur spit on Mike at an event, leading us all to have a profound distrust of humanity.</p><p>The site flourished during the Web 3.0 and Mobile Web days and settled into a routine of startup news speckled with more hard-hitting investigations on privacy and hardware. It spawned the best startup event on the planet, Disrupt, and essentially defined how to pitch for tens of thousands of entrepreneurs. I personally ran pitch-offs around the world in bars and concert halls as a sort of scouting mechanism for TC. When I was doing this, during the early 2010s, TC was already becoming insular and SF-focused.</p><p>After the Great Recession, however, global startups and local U.S. startup hubs began producing some interesting things. The San Francisco-focused writers often ignored these startups simply because they didn’t get that innovation could happen anywhere outside of the Mission. I called myself the East Coast Editor and said that my beat was everything outside San Francisco.</p><p>This was TC’s first mistake.</p><p>To populate Disrupt with startups, it needed to bring in hopefuls from outside the Valley. Sure, you could bring Zuckerberg up from Palo Alto to speak, but smaller companies from places like Paris, Chicago, and Tel Aviv were the real customers. These folks, ignored by nearly everyone, felt they could get a fair hearing at Disrupt and on the pages of TechCrunch. Little did they know that the SF crew mostly cared about Uber’s next round of investment, while folks like myself and Mike Butcher brought the TC gospel to people who yearned to be noticed.</p><p>This effort turned into a grind. I’d fly into a city, get to the hotel, eat and drink too much, and then get cornered for five hours at an event where I drank even more. We’d hold a pitch-off with a few local startups and VCs and then run around Yount or Dizengoff Street until the wee hours, drunk on gin and tonics and power. We were kingmakers, after all.</p><p>This was TC’s second mistake.</p><p>TC squandered this power. The SF crew, now run by AOL and Yahoo overlords, were focused on everything except startups. Traffic was paramount and ad sales were vital, so niche startup posts, posts that everyone once read but were now read by the company, lost their value. Over time, the value of a traditional TC story waned. Sites liked ProductHunt - which the bosses at TC were thinking of buying - eclipsed the power of a TC post. PR got expensive, so companies used guerrilla tactics to raise their user counts and more cash. VCs grew more savvy and created their own pitch-offs and accelerators to build bigger portfolios. The kingmakers were no longer in charge. Further, mainstream news was covering startups, too, focusing on cool new sites and gadgets.</p><p>As an aside, have you ever wondered why gadget sites suck now? You can thank the guy who replaced me at Gizmodo before I started CrunchGear, Brian Lam. Lam hit on the exciting concept that he should be paid for every widget one of his reviews sold, which led to affiliate marketing and, in turn, turned gadget review sites into churnalistic slop. In fact, his concept, one that ravaged sites like Engadget and CrunchGear, is directly responsible for the fact that outlets like New York Magazine were writing SEO-larded reviews of audio soundbars and TVs so they could get a 2% cut on every sale. Afflicting the comfortable, indeed.</p><p><span>But one thing TC always had was an edge. Arrington was often gleefully mean to startups that didn&#39;t live up to their promises. He called out Twitter for being down and essentially invented the “</span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2008/04/06/comcast-twitter-and-the-chicken-trust-me-i-have-a-point/" rel="">complain on social media</a><span>” method of getting better customer service. At CrunchGear, we skewered things we thought were bad, called out bad actors, and did awful stuff like having Hitler complain about a new, overhyped tablet being late to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2011/01/24/hitler-discusses-the-notion-ink-adam-delays/#!" rel="">market</a><span>:</span></p><div id="youtube2-js7awHyFwKI" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;js7awHyFwKI&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/js7awHyFwKI?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p>All that went away as bosses from Yahoo tried to understand how to milk even more cash out of TC’s events division while shutting down its multimedia efforts. Editor Matthew Panzarino did an admirable job of negotiating those shoals by keeping the suits out of the organization, but after he left they rushed in to fill Panzer’s glad-handing void. The result is TC’s third and final mistake.</p><p>After years of corporate ownership, culminating in Yahoo’s sale to private equity firm Apollo, TC has become a milquetoast site focused on big raises specially placed by expensive PR people and random tech news that has been neutered into pablum. The current editorial structure, controlled by one or two old-guard TCers and a lot of older editors hired by editor Connie Loizos. The once-freewheeling editorial strategy - writers wrote what they wanted at any time and nobody really edited anything - is being replaced by a more formalized system familiar to those who are one job away from become PR people themselves, while any hint of anger against the current crop of boy-kings in SF is dealt with harshly.</p><p><span>This all leads to what happened recently at TC. </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hjkamps/overlay/about-this-profile/" rel="">Haje Kamps</a><span> (who was, incidentally, running a side business advising startups, something that would have gotten him canned in previous incarnations of TC but was ignored because the wall between VC and editorial has been worn down to a nub) wrote about the lie of Alexandr Wang’s take on DEI vs. meritocracy. In a post that has since been toned down, Haje argued that Wang was a wang.</span></p><p><em><span>I just came off recording an </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/podcast/ai-powered-drug-development-vw-teams-up-with-rivian-and-dei-is-bad/" rel="">episode of Equity</a><span>, where I learned about the newest wave of stupidity. The tech industry’s DEI allergy has hit a new low, as Silicon Valley leaders are once again waving their “meritocracy” banners high and wide. Scale AI’s Alexandr Wang has decided that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) are passé — and replaced them with his shiny new acronym MEI: merit, excellence, and intelligence. I cringed so hard I’m going to need a chiropractor.</span></em></p><p>DEI has long been a dangerous thing in the valley, primarily because the Valley is primarily run by white dudes. These white dudes, who got lucky once or twice and are worth billions, think everyone could be like them with just a little elbow grease and grit. After all, little Mark Zuckerberg pulled himself up by his bootstraps while hanging out in the dorms at Harvard and poor Travis Kalanick invented Uber when he was having a hard time finding a cab to go to a party in Paris. Meanwhile, the only notable entrepreneur to do jail time for defrauding investors was Elizabeth Holmes and the African-American founders of MoviePass were pushed out of the company by a lucky white dude.</p><p><span>White dude CEOs like </span><a href="https://www.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-is-a-mission-focused-company" rel="">Brian Armstrong</a><span> and Jesse Powell came out hard against DEI efforts and even </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kraken-crypto-ceo-jesse-powell-does-not-regret-offending-anyone-2022-7" rel="">paid employees to leave,</a><span> which led, incidentally, to morale at their companies so low it could be measured in millisieverts. But they were making money, baby, so it was all good.</span></p><p>So, by all measures, Alexandr Wang’s MEI bullshit was just that, bullshit. And Haje, speaking in a voice that once rang out of the old TechCrunch like a clarion, called him out. The resulting Twitter backlash spooked Loizos and Haje was dumped from the roster a few months after another group of OG TCers, including Catherine Shu, Matt Burns, and Darrell Etherington - were laid off. This trio alone were responsible for a good percentage of TC’s global traffic because they were still writing interesting things and had been for nearly two decades. Also laid off was a large number of the marketing team. In short, TC is contracting and getting scared.</p><p>Loizos has to earn out her buy-out, and her new editors, refugees from the great business news layoffs of the 2020s, are hungry to stay relevant. The site itself is global, but news sits on the page for hours instead of minutes, and the value of the site is in the toilet.</p><p><span>I talk to VCs and startup founders all the time on </span><a href="https://keepgoingpod.com" rel="">Keep Going</a><span> and all of them say the same thing: they don’t read TC. The value to their businesses is simply gone, and the current story roster - from press releases like </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/capcut-will-stop-offering-free-cloud-storage-from-august-5/" rel="">CapCut</a><span> making a policy change to </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/10/facebook-to-face-of-crypto-anthony-pompliano-wild-career/" rel="">glowing VC interviews</a><span> with some of the same odious men who believe in MEI - is junk. There are still plenty of people I consider friends and confidants on staff, and I know not every story is garbage. Sometimes </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/a-vc-told-keely-cat-wells-to-get-a-male-able-bodied-co-founder-she-balked-nabbed-a-2m-seed-round/" rel="">gold still shines through</a><span> (but even in this case the article is too long by half, something one of those vaunted editors should have caught). But in the end, TC is no longer relevant.</span></p><p>Here’s the saddest thing: it should be. Startups haven’t gone away. Any media startup could essentially recreate Arrington’s model and start selling little ads while profiling startups. Fun can be had poking holes in Valley blowhards, and there could be reams of content to be had by telling people how to be successful in startup land. But TC won’t do that anymore. It is stuck, churning through releases from the same pushy Valley PR people and thinking they’re doing good work when they simply aren’t.</p><p>What would I do? Bring back a global focus to startup coverage, ignore the PR people flogging minor updates to already popular services, and become the place where VCs go to figure out where to invest. This was TC’s original magic. By reducing the editors, who are currently awash in posts and unable to keep up, to give TC back some of its vitality. And they’d get bonus points for making money from events again and pulling themselves out from under the boulder of private equity.</p><p>I don’t write those words without sadness. Knowing what could have been had TC not climbed up its own backside makes me mad. An industry that once grew and changed and embraced nearly everyone before contracting into a black hole of Valley douchery is now holding the reins to its only source of criticism and celebration. TC isn’t a news site. It’s a corpse.</p><p>That’s its final failure.</p></div></div></div>
