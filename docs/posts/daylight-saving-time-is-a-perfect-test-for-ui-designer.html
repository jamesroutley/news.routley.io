    <h1>Daylight Saving Time is a perfect test for UI designer</h1>
    
    
<p>I have five clocks in my house. All of them I have to change manually twice a year: one hour back in the Autumn and one hour forward in the Spring. Today was one of these days.</p>
<p>Each clock presents a unique puzzle. Three out of five have no direct controls for changing time, and manuals have long been lost, so I have to figure it out every time.</p>
<p>This is Ikea Vikis. It only has these two buttons:</p>

<p>This kitchen timer called Aimilar has seven, but none of them control the clock:</p>

<p>There is a “Timer/Clock” button, but it only switches between these two modes.</p>
<p>Finally, my microwave has this intuitive UI:</p>

<p>By the amount of “smart” functions you might think it already has AI but luckily it predates AI by several years.</p>
<p>As you can guess, setting time is a game of trial and error. My favorite is the microwave: while setting time is more or less intuitive with <code>−</code> and <code>+</code>, getting in this mode requires unplugging the whole thing.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to think inside the world of interface alone, you have to break out into the real world. Hey, the power cord is UI too!</p>
<h1 id="this-is-a-test">This is a test</h1>
<p>So here’s my idea: if you are hiring UI/UX designers, ask them to design UI for a wall clock/kitchen timer, specifically the part that sets the time.</p>
<p>The task has unique constraints:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Don’t need to optimize for speed of operation, only for clarity</li>
  <li>Should probably not be in your face (only needed twice a year), but also easy to find and understand (conflict in requirements)</li>
  <li>Can’t rely on manuals (will be lost)</li>
  <li>Can’t rely on memory (users will forget anything after 6 months)</li>
  <li>Can’t be too smart (this is <em>very</em> dumb electronics, also manufacturing price considerations)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it’s not just the resulting UI that should be tested, but also an ability to deduce all these constraints.</p>
<p>If you are curious, my two possible answers are <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/dst/solutions.jpg">here</a>.</p>
<p>What are yours?</p>
