    <h1>PSA III</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>A new PSA! We haven&#39;t done these in a while! How fun!</p>
<p>In this third installment I just want to tell you that I added two new subsites to my website, now linked to on my homepage. The first one is <a href="https://veitheller.de/art">a website for my latest exploits in computer-generated art</a>, which I&#39;ve now shown quite a lot of people already, but might be of interest anyway. Most of the happened in the last week, and I&#39;m pretty excited to share it.</p>
<p>The other I&#39;m not quite so sure about. It&#39;s <a href="https://veitheller.de/poems">a website for my poems</a>. Most of them are written in German—except the poems in <a href="https://veitheller.de/poems/felt.html">felt</a>—, and I&#39;m not sure whether I like them, but I&#39;ve been writing for years and years, and a lot of people from my home town actually know some of my older work, as I&#39;ve annoyed everyone through public appearances all through my flamboyant adolescence.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m less full of myself, and, as a result, less sure of my poems. But I will put them out there anyway, hoping they will not lead to outright dismissal.</p>
<p>That&#39;s all I have to say this time.</p>
