    <p>I get frustrated at how successful social media companies are at hijacking societal levels of attention. It’s tough to resist the products and antics of companies like Meta, TikTok or X. It’s not enough to ditch them yourselves, you really have to convince the people around you to ditch them too.</p>

<p>I’ve found it very difficult to convince people to look away from platforms that employ addictive algorithms and have strong network effects (ie all of your friends are on them). It’s difficult even when trying to convince close friends who are aware of and sympathetic to the negative effects of these products.</p>

<p>The reality I’ve learned to accept is that I generally can’t talk about these opinions without coming across as condescending or a jerk. Trying to persuade through conversation gets annoying very quickly. Hinting at being frustrated when they’re on their phones also doesn’t work. It just makes you seem passive-aggressive and is self-defeating.</p>

<p>What’s there to do, then? How can we, those who believe these companies are up to no good, convince our friends and family to put their phones down and be present in real life? I’ve long struggled with this question, but think I’ve stumbled into an approach that’s been sitting in front of me this whole time: be the instigator of meaningful interaction.</p>

<p>It’s a fancy way to say rather than try to convince people of the misgivings of social media, try to offer them a healthier and more compelling alternative for their attention. Throw a potluck dinner, organize a bike ride or hike, have a board game night, invite a friend to a bar or coffee shop, even something as simple as calling somebody up and having a phone conversation.</p>

<p>The rationale behind this theory is that the attention economy operates as a zero-sum game. That is, there is a fixed number of available hours of people’s attention. When competing for attention, companies must compete not just with each other, but also with the activities of everyday life. If I can convince people to do something that doesn’t involve their phones for a couple of hours, that’s two hours that are no longer available for a social media company to monetize. This is a win-win: I’m getting meaningful interaction with friends while also taking away time that can be monetized by social media companies.</p>

<p>Yes, it takes a bit of bravery and extroversion to be the instigator of social events within your circles. I want to write more about how I’ve been successful in overcoming the fears around this myself. For now, I hope you can take my word that it’s not too hard and also incredibly rewarding to be the one who brings friends and family together. Even if you think everything I’m saying about social media is bogus, what do you have to lose by inviting a friend to hang out?</p>
