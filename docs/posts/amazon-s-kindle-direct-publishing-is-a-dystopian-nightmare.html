    <h1>Amazon&#39;s Kindle Direct Publishing is a dystopian nightmare</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Imagine this scenario: You get pulled over by a robot cop. The robot immediately terminates your driver&#39;s license <i>forever</i> for driving an 18-wheeler without proper certification. You point to the Mini Cooper you were driving when the robot pulled you over. The robot ignores you.</p><p>Eventually, a different robot shows up, listens to your defense, sees the Mini Cooper, and watches you start the car with your own keys. There is no 18-wheeler in sight. The new robot says it will get back to you in 5 business days.</p><p>Two weeks go by, and a third different robot tells you your appeal has been denied for &#34;driving in such a way that creates a negative experience for other drivers&#34;. All the stuff about 18-wheeler certification is never mentioned or acknowledged again.</p><p>You appeal again and again. All your appeals are heard by yet more robots, who always uphold the original robot&#39;s decision, regurgitating the same bland phrase about creating a negative driving experience. THE END</p><p>This is basically what has happened to me with Amazon&#39;s KDP. I published my paperback through Ingram Spark and my Kindle eBook through KDP. My eBook passed review and was for sale for a few days. I claimed the paperback on my author central page, where it appeared side by side with the Kindle version. I was told to wait a week and the two versions should link up automatically (so they appear as the same book). If not, I should send an email to Amazon support.</p><p>Then the eBook was blocked, and a day later I got this in an email from KDP&#39;s Content Review Team:</p><p>&gt; During our review, we found that the following book(s) creates a misleading customer experience by impairing customers&#39; ability to make good buying decisions.</p><p>&gt; Land Without a Continent: A Road Trip through Mexico and Central America</p><p>&gt; Items that can cause a misleading customer experience include:</p><pre><code>  - Similarity of the contributor name to another author
  - Similarity of the title to a previously published book
  - Similarity of the cover to a previously published book
  - Cover text or images that do not accurately represent the contents of the book
  - Title or subtitle that do not accurately represent the contents of the book
  - Similarity of the description to a previously published known work
</code></pre><p>
I replied to their email pointing out that there is no book with a remotely similar name, description and author name as my book. I even did a reverse image search on my cover, and the only hit was my book on Amazon. It seems obvious to me that their AI-powered fraud detection system hallucinated that I plagiarized my own paperback.</p><p>The next day, they terminated my account. I appealed. I got an automated reply saying to give them 5 business days to review my case. That stretched into two weeks. Finally, I got an email stating my appeal was denied with only this message:</p><p>&gt; We found that you have published titles with misleading metadata (including cover), which creates a negative customer experience.</p><p>It seems like they picked the only one of the six bullet points that couldn&#39;t be easily disproven, and ran with it. I continued to email and managed to get a few more informal appeals, all denied with the exact same vague nonsense message. I even emailed jeff@amazon.com.</p><p>I had finally given up, when I got an email from Robert from their Executive Customer Relations Team. Hooray a human being (maybe)! A day later, Robert upheld the termination with the exact same vague reason above and some semi-belligerent language about how this was my last appeal.</p><p>Here&#39;s plenty more reading:</p><p>https://writersweekly.com/angela-desk/and-even-more-complaints-about-amazon-kdp-kindle-direct-publishing</p><p>https://www.trustpilot.com/review/kdp.amazon.com</p><p>https://medium.com/@peteylao/my-cover-story-aka-how-i-managed-to-get-my-kdp-account-suspended-terminated-and-finally-fd3631e84aba</p><p>https://judylmohr.com/2024/02/02/my-amazon-nightmares-2024/</p></div></div></div>
