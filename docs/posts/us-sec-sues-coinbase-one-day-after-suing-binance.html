    <h1>US SEC sues Coinbase, one day after suing Binance</h1>

The SEC accuses Binance and its CEO Changpeng Zhao of operating a <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-sec-sues-binance-founder-zhao-alleging-securities-law-violations-2023-06-05/">&#34;web of deception&#34;.</a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">If successful, the lawsuits could transform the crypto market by successfully asserting the SEC&#39;s jurisdiction over the industry which for years has argued that tokens do not constitute securities and should not be regulated by the SEC.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">&#34;The two cases are different, but overlap and point in the same direction: the SEC&#39;s increasingly aggressive campaign to bring cryptocurrencies under the jurisdiction of the federal securities laws,&#34; said Kevin O’Brien, a partner at Ford O’Brien Landy and a former federal prosecutor, adding, however, that the SEC has not previously taken on such major crypto players.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">&#34;If the SEC prevails in either case, the cryptocurrency industry will be transformed.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">In its complaint filed in Manhattan federal court, the SEC said Coinbase has since at least 2019 made billions of dollars by operating as a middleman on crypto transactions, while evading disclosure requirements meant to protect investors.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">The SEC said Coinbase traded at least 13 crypto assets that are securities that should have been registered, including tokens such as Solana, Cardano and Polygon.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Coinbase suffered about $1.28 billion of net customer outflows following the lawsuit, according to initial estimates from data firm Nansen. Shares of Coinbase&#39;s parent Coinbase Global Inc closed down $7.10, or 12.1%, at $51.61 after earlier falling as much as 20.9%. They are up 46% this year.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">Paul Grewal, Coinbase&#39;s general counsel, in a statement said the company will continue operating as usual and has &#34;demonstrated commitment to compliance.&#34;</p><h2 data-testid="Heading">BROKER, EXCHANGE CRACKDOWN</h2><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Securities, as opposed to other assets such as commodities, are strictly regulated and require detailed disclosures to inform investors of potential risks. The Securities Act of 1933 outlined a definition of the term “security,” yet many experts rely on two U.S. Supreme Court cases to determine if an investment product constitutes a security.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">SEC Chair Gary Gensler has long said tokens constitute securities and has steadily asserted its authority over the crypto market, focusing initially on the sale of tokens and interest-bearing crypto products. More recently, it has taken aim at unregistered crypto broker dealer, exchange trading and clearing activity.</p><div data-testid="gallery-0"><div><div><p data-testid="Body"><b>[1/2] </b>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission logo and representations of cryptocurrency are seen in this illustration taken June 6, 2023.

The SEC also this year sued Beaxy Digital and Bittrex Global for failing to register as an exchange, clearing house and broker.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">&#34;The whole business model is built on a noncompliance with the U.S. securities laws and we&#39;re asking them to come into compliance,&#34; Gensler told CNBC.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Crypto companies refute that tokens meet the definition of a security, say the SEC&#39;s rules are ambiguous, and that it&#39;s overstepping its authority in trying to regulate them. Still, many companies have boosted compliance, shelved products and expanded outside the country in response to the crackdown.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">Kristin Smith, CEO of the Blockchain Association trade group, rejected Gensler&#39;s efforts to oversee the industry.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">&#34;We&#39;re confident the courts will prove Chair Gensler wrong in due time,&#34; she said.</p><figure data-testid="graphic-0"><div><div data-testid="Image"></div></div><figcaption data-testid="Body">Reuters Graphics</figcaption></figure><p data-testid="paragraph-16">Founded in 2012, Coinbase recently served more than 108 million customers and ended March with $130 billion of customer crypto assets and funds on its balance sheet. Transactions generated 75% of its $3.15 billion of net revenue last year.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">Tuesday&#39;s SEC lawsuit seeks civil fines, the recouping of ill-gotten gains and injunctive relief.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">On Monday, the SEC accused Binance of inflating trading volumes, diverting customer funds, improperly commingling assets, failing to keep wealthy U.S. customers off its platform, and misleading customers about its controls.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19"><a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/ecosystem/sec-complaint-aims-to-unilaterally-define-crypto-market-structure-8707489117122437402" target="_blank">Binance pledged</a> to vigorously defend itself against the lawsuit, which it said reflected the SEC&#39;s &#34;misguided and conscious refusal&#34; to provide clarity to the crypto industry.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-20">Customers <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/crypto-exchange-binance-hit-by-outflows-780-mln-last-24-hours-nansen-2023-06-06/">pulled around $790 million</a> from Binance and its U.S. affiliate following the lawsuit, Nansen said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-21">On Tuesday, the SEC filed a motion to freeze assets belonging to Binance.US.</p><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York and Hannah Lang and Michelle Price in Washington; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Leslie Adler</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p><div><address><a href="https://www.reuters.com/authors/hannah-lang/"></a><div><p><a data-testid="Heading" rel="author" href="https://www.reuters.com/authors/hannah-lang/">Hannah Lang</a></p><p data-testid="Heading">Thomson Reuters</p><p data-testid="Body">Hannah Lang covers financial technology and cryptocurrency, including the businesses that drive the industry and policy developments that govern the sector.
