    <h1>My Dad and Kurt Cobain</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>When my father moved back to Taiwan, my family bought a pair of fax machines. In theory, this was so he could help me with my math homework. I was starting high school, in California, and everything, from what instrument I played to the well-roundedness of my transcript, suddenly seemed consequential. In seventh grade, I had tested just well enough to skip two years of math, and now I was paying for it. I had peaked too early. In fact, I was very bad at math. Like many immigrants who prized education, my parents had faith in the mastery of technical fields—math and science—where answers weren’t left to interpretation. You couldn’t discriminate against the right answer.</p><p>Faxing was cheaper than long-distance calling, and involved far less pressure. The time difference between Cupertino and Taiwan was such that I could fax my father a question in the evening and expect an answer by the time I woke up. My homework requests were always marked “Urgent.”</p><p>He replied with equations and proofs, explaining the principles of geometry in the margins and apologizing if anything was unclear. After wearying of America’s corporate ladder, he’d moved to Taiwan to work as an executive in the burgeoning semiconductor industry, and he was busy establishing himself at his new job. I skimmed the explanations and copied down the equations and proofs. Every now and then, I rewarded his quick, careful attention by interspersing the next set of math questions with a digest of American news: I told him about Magic Johnson’s announcement that he was H.I.V.-positive, I narrated the events that led up to the Los Angeles riots, I kept him up to date on the fate of the San Francisco Giants. I told him about cross-country practice, made honest commitments to work harder at school. I listed the new songs I liked, and he would seek them out in Taipei’s cassette stalls and tell me which ones he liked, too:</p><blockquote><p>I like the November Rain by Guns N Roses. The Metallica is also great. I couldn’t enjoy the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Pearl Jam. The old songs reinterpreted by Mariah Carey (I’ll Be There) and Michael Bolton (To Love Somebody) are marvelous. The MTV’s “unplug” is a great idea!</p></blockquote><p>As a teen-ager, I had better things to do than fax with my dad. He seized upon anything I mentioned and barraged me with questions. When I described one of my classes as boring, he interrogated my use of the term, observing that “lots of ‘challenges’ are emotional ‘boring’ but reasonable ‘useful.’ ” I told him what we were reading in history class, and he asked, “You are convinced that Oswald alone killed JFK?”</p><p>He always asked me what I thought about things. Maybe this was an attempt to prolong our back-and-forth. He would bring up sports, a subject I didn’t think interested him at all:</p><blockquote><div><p>Redskin is too much for Bill!?</p><p>It’s down to the last week. This year, the NBA is very exciting? Is Nick [Knicks] out yet?</p><p>It’s Buckley [Barkley] vs. Jordon!</p><p>This World Series was spectacular.</p></div></blockquote><p>We were like two strangers trading small talk at a hardware store.</p><p>Whenever there was a weeklong break from school, my mom and I flew to Taiwan. We spent summers and winter vacations there; weeks would pass when the only people I spoke to were my parents and their middle-aged friends.</p><p>I never wanted to go to Taiwan. I couldn’t understand why my parents wanted to go back to a place they had chosen to leave.</p><p>My father left Taiwan for the United States in 1965, when he was twenty-one, and he was nearly twice as old before he set foot there again. In those days, you left if you were able to, especially if you were a promising student. A dozen other physics majors graduated with him from Tunghai University, and ten of them ended up pursuing careers abroad. My father flew from Taipei to Tokyo to Seattle to Boston. He scanned the crowd at the airport and saw a friend who’d come from Providence to pick him up and drop him off in Amherst.</p><p>But the friend didn’t know how to drive, so he had promised to buy lunch for another guy in exchange for a ride to the Boston airport, then to Amherst, and finally back to Providence. The two young men greeted my father at the gate, traded backslaps, and rushed him to the car, where they stowed his worldly possessions—textbooks and sweaters, mostly—in the trunk. Then they set off for Boston’s Chinatown, a portal to a world they had left behind.</p><p>In the years that followed, willingly marooned far from home, my father acquired various characteristics that might mark him as American. He lived in New York, witnessed and participated in student protests, and, according to old photos, sported long hair and vaguely fashionable pants. He arrived as a devotee of classical music, but within a few years his favorite song was the Animals’ “House of the Rising Sun.” He subscribed, very briefly, to <em>The New Yorker</em>, before realizing it wasn’t meant for newcomers like him, and requesting a refund. He discovered the charms of pizza and rum-raisin ice cream. Whenever new grad students arrived from Taiwan, he and his friends piled into a car to pick them up. It was a ritual, and it was a type of freedom—being on the road and possibly eating well—that was not to be passed up.</p><p>My dad wasn’t drawn to the U.S. by any specific dream, just a chance for something different. Still, he understood that American life is unbounded promise and hypocrisy, faith and greed, new spectrums of joy and self-doubt, freedom enabled by enslavement. All of these things at once.</p><p>When my mother was a child in Taiwan, her father set up a chalkboard in the family’s kitchen and wrote a new word in English on it every day. The Second World War had interrupted my grandfather’s medical studies, so he became a civil servant. He wanted slightly more for his children. My grandparents had their children choose American names, like Henry or Carol. The children picked up the basics of English, this bizarre new language, which they might use to speak a new future into being. They learned about the rest of the English-speaking world through a subscription to <em>Life</em>, where my mom first discovered the existence of something in America called Chinatown.</p><p>She arrived in the U.S. in 1971, to study public health at Michigan State University. Soon after she got to East Lansing, signed a lease, enrolled in classes, and bought a stack of nonrefundable textbooks, she received a message from her father. As she was making her way to Michigan, a letter had reached Taipei informing her that she’d been accepted to the University of Illinois, her top choice. So my mother recovered whatever tuition she could and left for Champaign-Urbana.</p><figure><p><span><div data-testid="responsive-cartoon"><a data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a23861&#34;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a23861" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“I don’t mind doing the dishes every night—it gives me time to deepen my resentment.”</span></p><div></div><p><span>Cartoon by Suerynn Lee</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>In the sixties and seventies, students from throughout the Chinese-speaking world found one another in these small, relatively remote college towns. School anchored my mother to the Midwest, but she roamed freely: a job at a community center in Kankakee, where she was one of only a few people who weren’t Black; a summer spent waitressing, where she ate ice cream every day for lunch. But some of her Taiwanese classmates couldn’t deal with this radical new context—or maybe it was a lack of context. She still remembers one girl who stopped going to classes altogether and spent her time drifting around campus. Even at the peak of summer, the girl wore her heaviest winter coat. Many of the other Taiwanese students kept their distance from her.</p><p>There were the potlucks with friends, when my mom would make lion’s-head meatballs; road trips to grocers that carried bok choy; the spontaneous communion of dorm life. You could identify Taiwanese students by their Tatung rice cookers. My mom took up painting, much of it abstract and surreal, with color patterns that didn’t reveal a discernible mood.</p><p>My father went from Amherst to Columbia University. From there, he followed his academic adviser to the University of Illinois, and met my mother. They married at a student center on campus. Only one person from their combined families was able to attend. But at least they had their friends. One was an artist, and he drew pictures of Snoopy and Woodstock on cardboard and arranged them in the grass outside the student center. Everyone brought a favorite dish.</p><p>My parents took a road trip to the East Coast for their honeymoon, snapping photos along the way. Their memories of this time come back to them in impressionistic fragments, since they lost all the undeveloped film when someone broke into their car in Manhattan.</p><p>I was born in 1977 in Champaign-Urbana. My dad wanted to become a professor. But, when he couldn’t find an academic job, we moved to Texas, where he worked as an engineer. The suburbs of Dallas afforded us plenty of space. One could get lost in that vastness. A few years ago, I found a small square of brittle, yellowed paper from the early eighties—an ad my mom took out in the local classifieds:</p><blockquote><div><p>CHINESE COOKING LESSONS—learn to Cook exotic dishes using ingredients and utensils readily available.</p><p>$12 per class. For further information call Mrs. Hsu at: 867-0712</p></div></blockquote><p>Nobody ever called. When I began speaking in a drawl, and begging for cowboy boots and an American name, and after it had been made clear to them that the local steak house wasn’t for their kind, they decided to move.</p><p>My parents’ American addresses are a history of friendships and acquaintances: a spare room in someone’s attic, visits to family friends whom they’d heard about but never actually met, a summer job in a small town a few hours away, an opportunity in an unfamiliar, emerging field. They didn’t dream of life in a big city so much as map out proximity to friends, Chinese food, a good school district—so, after Texas, it was either Delaware or California, and they chose California.</p><p>Cupertino was in transition when we arrived, in 1986. There was a huge factory downtown, farms on the outskirts, and a few buildings occupied by Apple. Apple seemed like a joke—nobody used Apple computers. As Silicon Valley flourished in the late eighties and early nineties, more Asian immigrants moved there. All my grandparents came from Taiwan to the South Bay, and most of my parents’ brothers and sisters settled there as well. The suburbs were amenable to a kind of haphazard, gradual transformation—flagging businesses were remade by new waves of immigrants, and strip malls began turning, store by store, into archipelagos of hyper-regional Chinese food and the latest in imported hair fads. There were bubble-tea cafés and Chinese bookstores, parking lots mazy with modified Hondas and moms hoping to preserve their pale complexions with full-face visors and elbow-length driving gloves. Chefs from Hong Kong and Taiwan joined the throngs of engineers coming to California. The pressure to appeal to non-Chinese shoppers or diners casually disappeared. Neck bones and chicken feet and various gelatinous things, VHS dubs of the latest Taiwanese dramas, Chinese-language newspapers and books: all could pay the bills, and then some.</p><p>Soon, my mom began grumbling about the newer immigrants from China—how they left their shopping carts strewn about the parking lot of the Asian grocery store. The distinctions between an immigrant who came from Taiwan in the sixties or seventies and one who came from mainland China in the nineties were probably imperceptible to anyone outside the Chinese-speaking diaspora. They looked roughly the same, and they probably both had accents. But they stood in different relation to American culture. These new, boisterous immigrants probably didn’t even know there was once only a single Asian grocer in the area, and it wasn’t even that good, and you had to drive a half hour to get there.</p><p>Among the surviving items from my parents’ frugal early years are weathered paperback copies of the Pentagon Papers and “Future Shock,” Alvin and Heidi Toffler’s 1970 best-seller about what happens to our psyches when the society around us undergoes rapid structural change. A pamphlet of Theodore Allen’s essay “Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race,” with “HSU” written across the cover. A book on Nixon’s visit to China; one on African American history. For a brief spell, my father toyed with Anglicizing his name, asking to be called Eric, but he soon realized that assimilation of that kind didn’t suit him.</p><p>From Amherst to Manhattan to Champaign-Urbana to Plano to Richardson to Mission Viejo to Cupertino: there were always the records, an old record player my father had assembled from a kit, a pair of Dynatone speakers. He started building his record collection as soon as he arrived in America. At first, he used a mail-order LP club, the kind where you overpay for a few and get a dozen more for a penny. The records were mostly classical. But sometime in the sixties he grew accustomed to Bob Dylan’s mysterious, off-kilter songs blasting from a neighbor’s apartment. He started buying Dylan records, learning to appreciate that voice, thin and deranged, perhaps more than he ever came to understand the words.</p><p>His records stayed protected in their shrink-wrap, if possible, to avoid wear to the cardboard sleeves. He would peel back part of the plastic to stamp his name. Some of his records were given away over the years, but the core remained: Dylan, the Beatles and the Stones, Neil Young, Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles. A few by the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd; some Motown collections. A lot of classical music. Blind Faith, because, when my parents were graduate students, an older faculty member from the West Indies had pulled out his violin during a dinner party to play the solo from “Sea of Joy.” There were John Lennon and George Harrison solo albums, but none by Paul McCartney, so I assumed that his post-Beatles career was awful. No Beach Boys meant they were probably awful, too. There was no jazz, except for a lone Sonny and Linda Sharrock album that’s still sealed. My parents played “Thriller” so often that I thought Michael Jackson was a family friend.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
