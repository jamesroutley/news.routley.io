  <p>On April 2nd, 2025, our president announced major new taxes on imports from foreign countries (“tariffs”), ranging from 10% to 49%. The stated goal is to bring manufacturing back to the United States and to “make America wealthy again”.</p><p>These tariffs will not work. In fact, they may even do the opposite, fail to bring manufacturing back and make America poorer in the process.</p><p>This article gives the 14 reasons why this is the case, how the United States could bring manufacturing back if it were serious about doing so, and what will ultimately happen with this wrongheaded policy.</p><p>I’ve been in the manufacturing industry for 15 years. I’ve manufactured in the USA and in China. I worked in a factory in China. I speak and read Chinese. I’ve purchased millions of dollars worth of goods from the US and China, but also Vietnam, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Cambodia. I’ve also visited many factories in Mexico and consider myself a student of how countries rise and fall.</p><p>In other words, unlike many who have voiced an opinion on this topic, I know what I am talking about. And that’s why I felt compelled to write this article. I had to do it. I’m a first-generation American and I love my country and it pains me to see it hurtling at high speed towards an economic brick wall. This article is an attempt to hit the brakes.</p><h3>The 14 Reasons Why these Tariffs Will Not Bring Manufacturing Back</h3><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>They’re not high enough</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>America’s industrial supply chain for many products is weak.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>We don’t know how to make it</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The effective cost of labor in the United States is higher than it looks</strong>Most people think that the reason why we make products in China instead of the United States is cheaper labor. That’s true, but it’s not the whole story. Frankly, the whole story is hard to read. People are not machines, they are not numbers on a spreadsheet or inputs into a manufacturing cost formula. I respect everyone who works hard and the people I have worked with over the years, and I want Americans to live better, happier lives.</p></li><li><p><strong>We don’t have the infrastructure to manufacture</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Made in America will take time.</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Uncertainty and complexity around the tariffs</strong>To start manufacturing in the United States, a company needs to make a large investment. They will need to buy new machinery and if no existing building is suitable, they will need to construct a new building. These things cost money, a lot, in fact. And significantly more in the USA, than they do in other countries. In exchange for this risk, there must be some reward. If that reward is uncertain, no one will do it.</p></li><li><p><strong>Most Americans are going to hate manufacturing</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>The labor does not exist to make good products</strong>There are over a billion people in China making stuff. As of right now there are 12 million people looking for work in the United States (4% unemployment). Ignoring for a moment the comparative inefficiency of labor and the billions of people making products outside of China, where are the people that are going to do these jobs? Do you simply say “make America great again” 3 times and they will appear with the skills needed to do the work?</p></li><li><p><strong>Automation will not save us.</strong>Most people think that the reason why American manufacturing is not competitive is labor costs. Most people think this can be solved by automation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Robots and overseas factory workers don’t file lawsuits, but Americans do</strong>I probably should not have written this article. Not only will I be attacked for being unpatriotic, but what I have written here makes me susceptible to employment lawsuits. For the record, I don’t use a person’s origin to determine whether or not they will do good work. I just look at the person and what they’re capable of. Doing otherwise is bad business because there are talented people everywhere.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enforcement of the tariffs will be uneven and manipulated</strong>Imagine two companies which import goods into the United States. One is based in China, while the other is based in the United States. They both lie about the value of their goods so that they have to pay less tariffs. </p></li><li><p><strong>The tariff policies are structured in the wrong way</strong>Why didn’t the jobs come back in 2018 when we initiated our last trade war? We applied tariffs, why didn’t it work?</p></li><li><p><strong>Michael Jordan sucked at baseball</strong></p></li></ol><h3>My prediction for what will happen with the tariffs</h3><p>This is probably the worst economic policy I’ve ever seen. Maybe it’s just an opening negotiating position. Maybe it’s designed to crash the economy, lower interest rates, and then refinance the debt. I don’t know.</p><h3>The 3 reasons why we want to actually bring manufacturing back</h3><p>2. It makes it easier to innovate. When the factory floor is down the hall, instead of 30 hours of travel away, it’s easier to make improvements and invent. We need to have manufacturing of high value goods, like drones, robots, and military equipment that are necessary for our economic future and safety. It will be difficult for us to apply artificial intelligence to manufacturing if we’re not doing it here.</p><p>3. People can simplistically be divided into three buckets: those of verbal intelligence, those of mathematical intelligence, and those of spatial intelligence. Without a vibrant manufacturing industry, those with the latter type of intelligence cannot fulfill their potential. This is one reason why so many men drop out, smoke weed, and play video games; they aren’t built for office jobs and would excel at manufacturing, but those jobs either don’t exist or pay poorly.</p><h3>How to actually bring manufacturing back</h3><p>Every country that has gone on a brilliant run of manufacturing first established the right conditions and then proceeded slowly.</p><p>Sadly, a lot of the knowhow to make products is outside of this country. Grant manufacturing visas, not for labor, but for knowhow. Make it easy for foreign countries to teach us how they do what they do best.</p><h3>Conclusion and final thoughts</h3><p>I care about this country and the people in it. I hope we change our mind on this policy before it’s too late. Because if we don’t, it might break the country. And, really, this country needs to be fixed.</p>
