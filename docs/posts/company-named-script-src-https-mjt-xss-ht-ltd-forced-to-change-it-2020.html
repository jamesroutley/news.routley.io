    <h1>Company named &#34;&gt;&lt;SCRIPT SRC=HTTPS://MJT.XSS.HT&gt; LTD&#34; forced to change it (2020)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Companies House has forced a company to change its name after it belatedly realised it could pose a security risk.</p><p>The company now legally known as “THAT COMPANY WHOSE NAME USED TO CONTAIN HTML SCRIPT TAGS LTD” was set up by a British software engineer, who says he did it purely because he thought it would be “a fun playful name” for his consulting business.</p><p>He now says he didn’t realise that Companies House was actually vulnerable to the extremely simple technique he used, known as “cross-site scripting”, which allows an attacker to run code from one website on another.</p><p>The original name of the company was ““&gt;&lt;SCRIPT SRC=HTTPS://MJT.XSS.HT&gt; LTD”. By beginning the name with a quotation mark and chevron, any site which failed to properly handle the HTML code would have mistakenly thought the company name was blank, and then loaded and executed a script from the site XSS Hunter, which helps developers find cross-site scripting errors.</p><p>That script would have simply put up a harmless alert – but it serves as proof that a malicious attacker could instead have used the same weakness as a gateway to more damaging ends.</p><p>Similar names have been registered in the past, such as “; DROP TABLE “COMPANIES”;-- LTD”, a <a href="https://pizzey.me/blog/no-i-didnt-try-to-break-companies-house/" data-link-name="in body link">wry attempt</a> to carry out an attack known as SQL injection, <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/" data-link-name="in body link">inspired by a famous XKCD webcomic</a>, but this was the first such name to have prompted a response. Companies House has retroactively removed the original name from its data feeds, and all documentation referring to its original moniker now reads simply “Company name available on request”.</p><p>The director of the company, who asked not to be named, told the Guardian: “Government Digital Service - GDS - have a good reputation for security, and other companies with similarly playful names have been registered in the past, so I thought there probably wouldn’t be a problem.</p><p>“When I discovered there were some minor problems, I contacted Companies House and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/03/covid-related-cybercrime-drives-attacks-on-uk-to-record-number" data-link-name="in body link">National Cyber Security Centre</a> immediately, and didn’t disclose the issue to anyone else.”</p><p>He did not realise it would be an issue, he said, because characters including &gt; and “ are explicitly allowed as company names, which suggested that the agency had put security measures in place to prevent such attacks.</p><p>A Companies House spokesperson said: “A company was registered using characters that could have presented a security risk to a small number of our customers, if published on unprotected external websites. We have taken immediate steps to mitigate this risk and have put measures in place to prevent a similar occurrence. We are confident that Companies House services remain secure.”</p></div></div></div>
