    <h1>6 unsolicited tips for booking Amtrak</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Note: this is most appropriate for the Northeast corridor, as this is what I am used to.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Book early (duh!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, Amtrak isn&#39;t like regional rail: Amtrak prices rise, and rise hard, on the popular routes (especially NE corridor) </li>
<li>(And don&#39;t try to buy a ticket on the train if you can at all avoid it)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If booking early, use the &#34;flex&#34; fare for more flexibility</p>
<ul>
<li>The nice thing about Amtrak is that it has very flexible cancellation policies, especially if you pay a couple of dollars extra<ul>
<li>As opposed to 75% back with the base fare      </li>
<li>But do the expected value calculation!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>So if you&#39;re considering a trip, book tickets early, and cancel as necessary</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider splitting up your segments into separate reservations: </p>
<ul>
<li>Amtrak&#39;s algorithm often chooses pricier connections if part of your trip is on the Northeast Corridor</li>
<li>If you book after the suggested connection, you&#39;re still a &#34;guaranteed&#34; connection in Amtrak&#39;s eyes. I&#39;ve done this before. (This is probably still a small risk) </li>
<li>But you can also be more cautious, because Amtrak&#39;s tolerances are often smaller than their train&#39;s propensity to be late</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider splitting a single segment into multiple tickets</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s worth checking. It is sometimes cheaper to book tickets from A -&gt; B and B -&gt; C than A -&gt; C even if they are all on the same train</li>
<li>You can stay in the same seat and everything</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the Northeast Corridor, consider using commuter rail instead</p>
<ul>
<li>The strongest example of this is Philly -&gt; Trenton -&gt; NYC using SEPTA and NJ transit that is always 30 bucks, even if you buy the tickets same day   </li>
<li>Even if you can&#39;t make it all the way (e.g. DC -&gt; NY), you might consider breaking up into segments<ul>
<li>Or Philly -&gt; Trenton SEPTA isn&#39;t great, so it can be worth booking Philly -&gt; Trenton on Amtrak and then Trenton -&gt; NY on NJ transit.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>This is a well kept secret </li>
<li>Says 15%, but can sometimes be much more</li>
