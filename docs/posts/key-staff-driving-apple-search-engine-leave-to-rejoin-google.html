    </p>          <p>Four years after Laserlike was acquired by Apple to boost its web search technology, the founders have quit to rejoin Google.
</p><p>Prior to forming Laserlike in 2015, Anand Shukla, Srinivasan Venkatachary and Steven Baker were all Google employees. Their work at Apple is one reason the company has <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/08/27/apple-may-launch-its-own-web-based-search-engine">been predicted</a> to launch its own search engine equivalent to Google&#39;s.
</p><p>Apple acquired Laserlike in 2018, though the deal wasn&#39;t made public until the <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/03/13/apple-confirms-buyout-of-machine-learning-startup-laserlike">following year</a>. As part of the acquisition, the company&#39;s three founders were, and ultimately they led a 200-strong search team at Apple.
</p><p>According to <em>The Information</em>, Srinivasan Venkatachary has <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-web-search-technology-chief-returns-to-google">now returned</a> to Google. He is reportedly the company&#39;s new vice president of engineering.
</p><p>Venkatachary reports to James Manyika, senior vice president of technology and society. Baker and Shukla now both work on Manyika&#39;s team. It&#39;s not known whether all three quit Apple at the same time, or whether Venkatachary is just the latest to move.
</p><p><em>The Information</em> cites an unnamed source with the details of the move, and the source also estimates that Apple is four years away from launching a Google rival.
</p><p>Rumors of Apple planning to make its own search engine got a boost after the launch of <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/ios-14">iOS 14</a> in 2020. Siri Suggestions were then reportedly <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/08/27/apple-may-launch-its-own-web-based-search-engine">being rooted</a> through Apple&#39;s Spotlight Search service, rather than being passed to Google.
</p><p>With long and involved projects like search, it&#39;s not uncommon for staff to move between Apple and Google. In 2018, the same year Apple bought Laserlike, it also poached <a href="https://appleinsider.com/inside/john-giannandrea">John Giannandrea</a> from Google.
</p><p>Giannandrea had been at Google for eight years, leaving as head of Machine Learning. <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/08/06/apples-john-giannandrea-talks-apple-silicon-moving-from-google-to-apple-in-interview">He&#39;s now</a> Apple&#39;s senior vice president of Machine Learning and AI Strategy.</p>
