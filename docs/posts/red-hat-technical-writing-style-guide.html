      ⁠</a>Chapter 1. Objectives of this Guide</h2></div></div></div><div><p>
		The objective of the Red Hat Style Guide is to help authors communicate information in a clear, transparent fashion, and to facilitate consistency in tone and delivery. We write documentation for various audiences, across multiple geographies and with different skill sets. We write for end users as well as expert users. Red Hat documentation is: 
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					Accurate and consistent.
				</p></li><li><p>
					Readable, with a score of 60-70 on the Flesch-Kincaid reading ease scale.
				</p></li><li><p>
					Comprehensible, with a fog index of 9-12, using the Gunning fog index.
				</p></li><li><p>
					User focused, providing information without patronizing the reader, or making presumptions about their skills.
				</p></li></ul></div>

	</div><div><p><a id="readability">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Readability</p><p>
			Technical documents should be readable by the targeted audience. In this instance, we expect our audiences to have the minimum reading and comprehension level of an eighth-grade student, of an age between 14 and 15 years. The Flesch-Kincaid and Gunning Fog index provide measurable grades. A Red Hat guide should have a Gunning Fog index of 9-12.
		</p></div></div><div xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"><p>
		This section contains information on a few common grammar topics. For subjects not covered here, consult The Chicago Manual of Style, 17th Edition.
	</p><div><p>
			Use the active voice (&#34;Type ... to start Linuxconf&#34;) rather than passive (&#34;Linuxconf can be started by typing ...&#34;) whenever possible. Active voice makes for more lively, interesting reading. It is more compelling than passive voice and helps to reduce word count.
		</p><p>
			This does not mean that the passive voice is forbidden. There are situations when using the passive voice is appropriate, such as release notes, technical notes, and similar material.
		</p><p>
			For example, the sentence, &#34;The Developer Center, a site for reference material and other resources, has been introduced to the OpenShift website.&#34; reads better than
		</p><p>
			&#34;The OpenShift website introduces the Developer Center, a site for reference material and other resources.&#34; Here, the passive voice is better because the important issue (&#34;The Developer Center&#34;) is the subject of the sentence.
		</p><p>
			You can also use the passive voice to front-load important keywords in key areas of your content, such as the title, heading, or at the beginning of a paragraph or sentence. You need to make these decisions on a case-by-case basis, weighing the importance of front-loading keywords against content that is readable (that is, not awkward sounding). Consider the following two examples:
		</p><div><p><a id="active-voice-example">
      ⁠</a></p><p><strong>Example 2.1. Active Voice</strong></p><div><p>
				&#34;Dutch hosting provider Oxilion launches <span><em>public cloud</em></span> service based on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization.&#34;
			</p></div></div><div><p><a id="passive-voice-example">
      ⁠</a></p><p><strong>Example 2.2. Passive Voice</strong></p><div><p>
				&#34;<span><em>Public cloud</em></span> service based on Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization launched by Dutch hosting provider Oxilion.&#34;
			</p></div></div></div><div><p>
			In grammar, agreement occurs when specific parts of a sentence are coordinated; that is, they agree in number and gender.
		</p><p>
			There are two forms of agreement: <span><em>subject-verb agreement</em></span> and <span><em>pronoun-antecedent agreement</em></span>. Subject-verb agreement is pretty rudimentary, and is not discussed here. Pronoun-antecedent agreement can be a little more problematic, so...
		</p><div><div><div><div><h3><a id="pronoun-antecedent-agreement">
      ⁠</a>2.2.1. Pronoun-antecedent agreement</h3></div></div></div><p>
				A <span><em>pronoun</em></span> is a word that is used in place of a noun (for example, I, he, she, it). An <span><em>antecedent</em></span> is a word or phrase to which the pronoun refers.
			</p><p>
				When you are comfortable with subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent agreement often follows as a matter of course.
			</p><p>
				The following is an annotated roundup of pronoun-antecedent rules:
			</p><div><p><a id="singular-plural-nouns">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Singular and Plural Nouns</p><p>
					A singular pronoun refers to a singular antecedent; a plural pronoun refers to a plural antecedent. For example:
				</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
						The CD spins in <span><em>its</em></span> caddy. (The singular third-person pronoun &#34;its&#34; refers to the singular antecedent &#34;CD&#34;.)
					</p></li><li><p>
						The developers checked <span><em>their</em></span> work. (The plural third-person pronoun &#34;their&#34; refers to the plural antecedent &#34;developers&#34;.)
					</p></li></ul></div><div><p><a id="collective-nouns">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Collective Nouns</p><p>
					When collective nouns are used as antecedents, use singular or plural pronouns, depending on the sentence&#39;s meaning. For example:
				</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
						Microsoft seems second to none in <span><em>its</em></span> marketing skills. (The collective noun &#34;Microsoft&#34; takes the singular pronoun &#34;its&#34; because the collective noun refers to the group as a whole.)
					</p></li><li><p>
						The developers were asked for <span><em>their</em></span> preferences. (The collective noun &#34;developers&#34; takes the plural pronoun &#34;their&#34; because the reference is to the individuals of the group.)
					</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div><p>
			For nouns that are not countable, it is correct to use &#34;less&#34; and &#34;amount&#34;, for example &#34;less memory&#34; or &#34;the required amount of memory&#34;. For nouns that are countable, use &#34;fewer&#34; instead of &#34;less&#34;, and use &#34;number&#34; instead of &#34;amount&#34;.

      ⁠</a>2.5. Using Who, Whom, That, and Which Correctly</h2></div></div></div><p>
			Use &#34;whom&#34; or &#34;who&#34; to introduce a qualifying phrase when the antecedent is a person. Use &#34;that&#34; or &#34;which&#34; when referring to a thing. Use &#34;which&#34; or &#34;that&#34; to introduce a qualifying phrase when the antecedent is a concept or an object. Who, whom, that, and which are known as &#34;relative pronouns&#34;.

      ⁠</a>2.6. Sentence Structure</h2></div></div></div><p>
			A <span><em>sentence</em></span> is one complete thought. A sentence expresses something about a subject (a person, place, or thing) and a verb (what the subject is or does).
		</p><p>
			Consider the following points when constructing sentences:
		</p><div><p><a id="length">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Sentence Length</p><p>
				Try not to pack too much information into one sentence. In technical documentation, try not to exceed 40 words in a sentence. Keep it short. The following sentence is a bad writing example:
			</p></div><p>
			The <span><strong>Start</strong></span> button, which you can find in the bottom left corner of your screen (also activated by the &#34;Windows key&#34; on your keyboard, the one between the <span><strong>Ctrl</strong></span> and <span><strong>Alt</strong></span> keys), provides a central starting point for applications and tasks, and can be customized according to your individual preferences so that it presents menu items relevant to you instead of presenting the standard items that come with the default installation of the operating system, items which, in my opinion, are irrelevant for most users these days who really only need access to an internet browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.
		</p><p>
			The following paragraph is a suggested improvement to the previous long sentence:
		</p><p>
			The <span><strong>Start</strong></span> button provides a starting point for any applications or tasks on your Windows system. Either click <span><strong>Start</strong></span> or press the <span><strong>Windows</strong></span> key to activate the  menu. You can customize the  menu to suit your own preferences.
		</p><div><p><a id="preposition">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Preposition at the End of a Sentence</p><p>
				Allow a preposition at the end of a sentence to avoid otherwise awkward wording.
			</p></div><p>
			For example, instead of &#34;Click the workspace to which you want to switch&#34;, which can sound stilted, it flows better to use &#34;Click the workspace to switch to&#34;.
		</p><div><p><a id="run-on">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Run-on Sentences</p><p>
				Two or more complete ideas that are joined without punctuation, or separated only by a comma, create a <span><em>run-on sentence</em></span> (also called a <span><em>fused sentence</em></span>). The sentence does not have to be long to be a run-on sentence, although the longer the sentence the more difficult it is to read. You can:
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					Separate independent clauses with a period. This creates two sentences from one.
				</p></li><li><p>
					Use semicolons to form a compound sentence. Think of a semicolon as an extended breather; it is longer than a comma.
				</p></li><li><p>
					Insert a <em>coordinating conjunction</em>, such as &#34;and&#34; or &#34;but&#34;, between the independent clauses to form a compound sentence. For example, &#34;The process starts, but it produces an error.&#34;
				</p></li><li><p>
					Insert a <em>subordinating conjunction</em>, such as &#34;although&#34; or &#34;because&#34;, which forms a compound sentence with a subordinate clause. For example, &#34;Although the process starts, it produces an error.&#34;
				</p></li></ul></div><div><p><a id="id1972">

      ⁠</a></p><p>Sentence Fragments</p><p>
				A <em>sentence fragment</em> is an incomplete sentence. For example, &#34;Red Hat releases no upgrade before its time.&#34; is a complete sentence, whereas in &#34;We will release no upgrade. At least, before its time.&#34; the second of the two sentences is a fragment. Repair sentence fragments by making them complete sentences.
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>

      ⁠</a></p><p>Telegraphic Style</p><p>

		</p><p>
			Take care also with abbreviations; replace &#34;e.g.&#34; with &#34;for example&#34;, and replace &#34;i.e.&#34; with &#34;that is&#34;, and so on.

	</p><div><div><div><div><h3><a id="colons-and-semicolons">
      ⁠</a>2.9.1. Colons and Semicolons</h3></div></div></div><p>
			Current standards allow the use of a colon or semicolon in a range of different circumstances. Some of these are described in the following sections.
		</p><div><p> To Relate Clauses</p><p>
				The following sentences show a connection or shared theme between two clauses, or use the second clause to reiterate or amplify the idea in the first clause:
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					They had been writing code all night: this factor could explain their bloodshot eyes.
				</p></li><li><p>
					They had been writing code all night; this factor could explain their bloodshot eyes.
				</p></li><li><p>
					I spend a lot of money on food; last month, I went out to eat 36 times.
				</p></li><li><p>
					I spend a lot of money on food: last month, I went out to eat 36 times.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			The phrase following a semicolon or colon should begin with a lowercase letter, unless it begins with a proper noun. In the case of a colon, use an uppercase letter if the phrase constitutes a complete sentence on its own.
		</p><p>
			Try to limit your use of colons and semicolons. Separate sentences with a period if possible.
		</p><div><p>To Introduce a Series</p><p>
				A colon is generally used before a series.
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					The Triangle Area consists of three cities: Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			Do not use a colon if the series is a complement or object of an element in the sentence.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					Before going on vacation, be sure to (1) set the alarm, (2) cancel the newspaper, and (3) ask a neighbor to collect your mail.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			Use a semicolon to separate items in a series if the items contain commas.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					Every day I have coffee, toast, and fruit for breakfast; a salad for lunch; and a peanut butter sandwich, cookies, ice cream, and chocolate cake for dinner.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			When a conjunctive adverb (such as <span><em>however, therefore, otherwise, namely, for example</em></span>, and so on) joins two independent clauses, use a semicolon before the conjunctive adverb and a comma after it.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					I think; therefore, I am.
				</p></li></ul></div><div><p><a id="list-intro-punc">
      ⁠</a></p><p>To Introduce a List, Command, Code Block, or Procedure</p><p>
				If a list, command, code block, or procedure immediately follows a single stem or introductory sentence, then end that sentence with a colon.
			</p></div><p>
			If, however, any sentences intervene between the introduction and the next item, then end both the introduction and any intervening sentences with a period instead.
		</p><p>
			In the following example, the related list immediately follows the stem, or introductory sentence, after &#34;as follows&#34;. If that sentence instead ends with &#34;the following&#34;, then ensure that a noun is used after those words.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					The steps for changing directories are as follows:
				</p><div><ol><li><p>
							Open a terminal.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Type <code>cd Documents/Books</code>.
						</p></li></ol></div></li></ul></div><p>
			In the following example, a colon is used to introduce a bullet list:
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					In the Properties dialog box, notice the following entries:
				</p><div><ul><li><p>
							Connection name
						</p></li><li><p>
							Count
						</p></li><li><p>
							Confirm starting connection
						</p></li><li><p>
							Confirm stopping connection
						</p></li><li><p>
							Cost per unit
						</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><p>
			In the following example, a colon is used for a step that introduces a command:
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					2. Use the <code>ansible-navigator run</code> command to run the <code>allfacts.yml</code> playbook:
				</p><pre>[student@workstation manage-facts]$ ansible-navigator run allfacts.yml
PLAY [Gather and display facts for managed nodes] ****************************</pre></li></ul></div><p>
			In the following example, several sentences introduce a code example, and each one ends in a period:
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					To configure SELinux persistently, use the <code>/etc/selinux/config</code> file. In the following default example, the configuration sets SELinux to <code>enforcing</code> mode. The comments list other valid values, such as the <code>permissive</code> and <code>disabled</code> modes.
				</p><pre># This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
# enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
# permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
# disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
<span><em>...output omitted...</em></span></pre></li></ul></div></div><div><div><p><a id="compound-sentences">
      ⁠</a></p><p>In Compound Sentences</p><p>
				Use a comma to join clauses in a compound sentence, unless the clauses are short and have a similar theme.
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					I spent five hours working on this document, but I lost it when my computer crashed.
				</p></li><li><p>
					Do you want to go the mall and the grocery store with me, or are you going to watch football instead?
				</p></li><li><p>
					You play and I&#39;ll sing.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			A comma can be omitted from a sentence with several clauses, but only when there is little chance that the sentence could be misread without it.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					We played football all afternoon and were completely exhausted but we still stayed up watching movies all night.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			That sentence is acceptable, but adding a comma before &#34;... but we still stayed up ...&#34; would provide a pause and avoid the chance of having it read like a run-on sentence.
		</p><p>
			In a compound sentence that contains several short independent clauses, separate the clauses with commas and use a comma before the conjunction.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					You need to go to the grocery store for milk, drop off my dry cleaning, and pick up your little sister from soccer practice.
				</p></li></ul></div><div><p><a id="conjunctive-adverbs">
      ⁠</a></p><p>With Conjunctive Adverbs</p><p>
				When using a conjunctive adverb (such as <span><em>however, therefore, otherwise, namely, for example</em></span>, and so on) in a sentence, set it off with commas.
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					It rained all afternoon. As a result, we canceled our picnic.
				</p></li><li><p>
					The grass, however, stayed dry under the trees.
				</p></li></ul></div><div><p><a id="adverbial-clauses">
      ⁠</a></p><p>In Adverbial Clauses and Phrases</p><p>
				If a dependent clause is restrictive (omission affects the meaning of the main clause), do not set it off with commas. If it is nonrestrictive (omission does not affect the main clause), set it off with commas:
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					I&#39;ll go to lunch with you if we can get pizza.
				</p></li><li><p>
					I don&#39;t want to go out for pizza, because I had pizza yesterday.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			If a dependent clause comes before the main clause, use a comma whether the clause is restrictive or not.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					If we get pizza, I&#39;ll go to lunch with you.
				</p></li><li><p>
					When I heard the voice on the other end of the line, I was quite surprised.
				</p></li></ul></div><div><p><a id="adjectival-clauses">
      ⁠</a></p><p>In Adjectival Clauses or Phrases</p><p>
				An adjectival clause that can be dropped without changing the meaning of the sentence is set off with commas.
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					The application, which comes with excellent documentation, is used by many graphic artists.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			An adjectival clause that cannot be dropped without changing the meaning of the sentence is not set off with commas:
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					The plan that matters most to us will be easy to implement.
				</p></li></ul></div><div><p><a id="coordinate-adjectives">
      ⁠</a></p><p>With Coordinate Adjectives</p><p>
				Separate coordinate adjectives (two or more adjectives modifying the same noun) with commas.
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					My dog is loyal, obedient, and affectionate.
				</p></li><li><p>
					It was a long, boring meeting.
				</p></li></ul></div><div><p><a id="series-lists">
      ⁠</a></p><p>With Series and Lists</p><p>
				Separate elements in a series of three or more with commas, including a comma before the conjunction if one is used.
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					Today I am wearing socks, shoes, pants, and a shirt.
				</p></li></ul></div></div><div><p>
			Parentheses are similar to commas in that they set off information that further explains or enhances a statement. Information that is closely related to the statement should be set off with commas; information that is more incidental should be set off with parentheses.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					I tried to get to the elevator before the door shut, but I was too slow.
				</p></li><li><p>
					Most of my favorite authors (Shakespeare, Dickens, Woolf) are dead.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			Expressions beginning with <span><em>for example, that is</em></span> and so on can be set off with parentheses if they cause a major break in the sentence. If the break is minor, use commas.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					He interviewed the biggest stars of the day, namely, Madonna, Johnny Cash, and Jack Nicholson.
				</p></li><li><p>
					Classic works of literature (such as Dickens, Shakespeare, the Brontes) lined the shelves.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			If the contents of the parentheses include at least one complete sentence, the period goes inside the parentheses. If not, the period goes outside.
		</p><p>
			Do not use &#34;(s)&#34; in parentheses to denote a plural. If something can be singular or plural, make it plural.
		</p><div><p><a id="id2398">

			Avoid use of a slash character to mean either of two options.
		</p><p>
			For example, instead of &#34;enable/disable&#34;, use &#34;enable or disable&#34;.

			Instead of &#34;A and/or B&#34;, use &#34;A or B&#34;, or &#34;A, or B, or both&#34;.
		</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3><a id="quotation-marks">
      ⁠</a>2.9.5. Quotation Marks</h3></div></div></div><p>
			When indicating the start or end of a direct quotation, use curly quotation marks. In all other contexts, such as when writing code samples, code syntax, hexadecimal numbers, or hypertext links, use straight quotation marks. Refer to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=punctuation-quotation-marks#typographical-considerations"><em>Typographical Considerations</em></a> in <em>IBM Style</em> <span><strong>
			<span><img src="https://brian.abelson.live/log/2025/07/05/images/padlock.png"/></span>
			</strong></span>.
		</p><p>
			In technical documentation, place punctuation marks, including periods, commas, question marks, exclamation points, dashes, and semicolons inside the quotation marks if they are part of the quotation or part of a programming element that uses quotation marks; if not, place punctuation marks outside the quotation marks. If a sentence ends with a quotation, use only one punctuation mark to end the sentence, and place it inside the closing quotation mark if it is part of the quotation, or outside if it is not.

			Do not use an apostrophe to denote a plural.
		</p><p>
			To denote a possessive, use an apostrophe as follows:
		</p><p>
			Plural nouns not ending in <span><em>s</em></span> should add an <span><em>&#39;s </em></span> (for example, the alumni&#39;s contribution).
		</p><p>
			Plural nouns ending in <span><em>s</em></span> only need an apostrophe (for example, the horses&#39; food).
		</p><p>
			Singular common nouns ending in <span><em>s</em></span> should add an <span><em>&#39;s</em></span> unless the next word begins with an <span><em>s</em></span> (for example, the witness&#39;s answer or the witness&#39; story).
		</p><p>
			Singular proper names ending in <span><em>s</em></span> only need an apostrophe (for example, Dickens&#39; novels).
		</p><p>
			Whether an apostrophe uses a straight character (the same as a straight single quotation mark) or a curly character is determined by considerations that include language, translation, and typography.
		</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3><a id="exclamation">
      ⁠</a>2.9.7. Exclamation Points</h3></div></div></div><p>

			Use the following guidance for punctuation in tables:
		</p><p>
			If all cells in a table column are complete sentences, then end each cell with a period.
		</p><p>
			If all cells in a table column are sentence fragments, then do not use a period to end each cell.

			If cells in a table column contain a mixture of complete sentences and sentence fragments, then first consider whether it would be appropriate to make them grammatically parallel (either all complete sentences or all sentence fragments). However, in some cases, such an approach might not work, where tables are complex and include a variety of content, such as lists of strings, variables, IP addresses, descriptions, or states (selected or cleared). In such cases, treat each cell as an individual entry, and either use or omit a closing period depending on whether that cell is a complete sentence.

			To refer to a punctuation mark or special character, use its name alone if it is one of the following standard characters:
		</p><p>
			. , : ; &#39; ‘ ’ &#34; “ ” ( ) [ ] { } ! ?
		</p><p>
			For all other characters, use the character name followed by the symbol in parentheses. For special character names that include a noun such as &#34;sign&#34;, &#34;symbol&#34;, or &#34;character&#34;, provide the character name, the noun that describes the symbol, and then the symbol in parentheses, for example &#34;the greater-than symbol (&gt;)&#34;. For special character names that do not include such nouns, provide the character name and the symbol in parentheses, for example &#34;a forward slash (/)&#34;. You can end a sentence with the symbol in parentheses.
		</p><p>

			No hard and fast rules exist for hyphenation. In general, do not hyphenate unless required for clarity, or your other references declare that hyphens are required. The following is general guidance; if you are unsure about whether to hyphenate, ask your peers. Refer to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=punctuation-hyphens"><em>Hyphens</em></a> in <em>IBM Style</em> <span><strong>
			<span><img src="https://brian.abelson.live/log/2025/07/05/images/padlock.png"/></span>
			</strong></span>.
		</p><div><p><a id="hyphenate-for-clarity">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Hyphenate for Clarity</p><p>
				Hyphenate when needed for clarity. Words that begin with prefixes are usually not hyphenated. Prefixes can include &#34;multi&#34;, &#34;non&#34;, &#34;sub&#34;, &#34;co&#34;, &#34;semi&#34;, &#34;pre&#34;, &#34;re&#34;, and so on. The same applies to suffixes; for example, &#34;less&#34; as a suffix does not require hyphenation.
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
				Always use a hyphen if clarity would suffer otherwise. For example, &#34;He recovered his health&#34; versus &#34;He re-covered the leaky roof.&#34;<a id="id2668">
      ⁠</a><a href="#ftn.id2668"></a>
			</p></div></div><div><p><a id="hyphenate-complex-adjectives">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Hyphenate Complex Adjectives</p><p>
				Hyphenate complex adjectives (compound modifiers). This is when two adjectives work together to modify an object. The hyphen is used when the first adjective modifies the second adjective. For example, cloud-based solutions, right-side paralysis, system-wide menu.
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
				Do not hyphenate &#34;open source&#34;, even when used as a complex adjective.
			</p><p>
				Do not hyphenate a compound that includes an adverb that ends in <span><em>-ly</em></span>, whether it comes before or after the noun, because it is never ambiguous. This is described in Chicago Manual of Style 7.82. For example, &#34;Red Hat Enterprise Linux is a production-ready, commercially supported Linux distribution.&#34;
			</p></div></div><div><p><a id="hyphenate-consecutive-vowels">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Hyphenate Consecutive Vowel Sounds</p><p>
				Hyphenate words where the prefix ends in a vowel and the word that follows begins with the same vowel. For example, semi-independent, pre-emptive.
			</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
				Exceptions to this rule include <span><em>cooperate</em></span> and <span><em>coordinate.</em></span>
			</p></div></div><div><p><a id="hyphenate-mixed-caps">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Hyphenate Mixed Capitalization</p><p>
				Hyphenate when the word that follows a prefix is capitalized. For example, un-American, non-British.
			</p></div><div><p><a id="hyphenate-double-prefixes">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Hyphenate Double Prefixes</p><p>
				Hyphenate when the word has double prefixes. For example, sub-subparagraph, re-sublet.
			</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2><a id="pronouns-gender-references">
      ⁠</a>2.11. Pronouns and Gender References</h2></div></div></div><p>
			Do not use gender-specific pronouns in documentation, except to refer to a specific named user, such as in a case study. It is easier to read a sentence that uses &#34;they&#34; and &#34;their&#34; rather than &#34;he/she&#34; and &#34;his/hers&#34;. It is acceptable to use &#34;they&#34; to refer to one person, with a plural verb.
		</p><p>
			Usually, when giving instructions, use the imperative mood or use &#34;you&#34;. In more general explanations, you can use &#34;users&#34; or &#34;new users&#34;. Do not use &#34;one&#34; in place of &#34;you&#34; when writing technical documentation, because it is too formal. Do not use &#34;it&#34; to refer to a person.
		</p><p>
			Avoid first person &#34;I, we, our&#34;. Use second person &#34;you&#34; whenever possible.
		</p><p>
			If referring to what Red Hat does, use &#34;Red Hat&#34; followed by a singular verb.
		</p><div><p><a id="id2697">
      ⁠</a></p><p><strong>Table 2.18. </strong></p><div><table xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" summary=""><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th> Example </th><th> Improvement </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> An engineer must be trained on the equipment that he services. </td><td> Engineers must be trained on the equipment that they service. </td></tr><tr><td> In the web console, we can restart or shut down the system. </td><td> In the web console, you can restart or shut down the system. </td></tr><tr><td> We recommend that you generate a service account for each microservice in your project. </td><td> Red Hat recommends that you generate a service account for each microservice in your project. </td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><div><p>
			Avoid future tense (or using the term &#34;will&#34;) whenever possible. For example, future tense (&#34;The window will open ...&#34;) does not read as well as the present tense (&#34;The window opens ...&#34;). Remember, the users you are writing for most often refer to the documentation while they are using the system, not after or in advance of using the system.
		</p><p>
			Use simple present tense as much as possible. It avoids problems with consequences and time-related communications, and is the easiest tense for translation.

      ⁠</a>3.1. Overall Publication Design</h2></div></div></div><p>
		This section describes a general approach to the overall layout and design of technical documentation. This design was developed specifically for technical documentation and might not suit content produced by other groups.
	</p><div><p>
		This section covers the following topics: 
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					Titles and subtitles
				</p></li><li><p>
					Prefaces
				</p></li><li><p>
					Abstracts
				</p></li><li><p>
					Introductions
				</p></li><li><p>
					Placement of headings
				</p></li><li><p>
					Unused heading titles
				</p></li></ul></div>

	</div><div><div><div><div><h3><a id="titles-and-subtitles">
      ⁠</a>3.1.1. Titles and Subtitles</h3></div></div></div><p>
			The title should be a combination of the complete product name, its version, and the name of the publication. For example, &#34;Red Hat Satellite 6.12 Installation Guide&#34;, or &#34;Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 Deployment Guide&#34;.
		</p><p>
			The subtitle should be a single, succinct phrase that describes the intent of the publication; an abstract of the abstract. For example, &#34;Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 for All Architectures&#34;.
		</p></div><div><p>
			The brands that form part of Publican (<a href="https://fedorahosted.org/publican/">https://fedorahosted.org/publican/</a>) contain a preface as part of the common content. Whether your publication is for external Red Hat customers, JBoss customers, internal customers, or whomever, the brand you choose should provide a suitable preface. Try to use the standard preface to help maintain consistency, reduce overhead and maintenance, and also to reduce translation costs. If you feel that the preface fails to meet your needs, consider whether or not you are using the correct brand, or if the brand itself requires an update.
		</p></div><div><p>
			Abstracts for Red Hat technical documentation typically fall under the heading of a &#34;descriptive abstract&#34;. From Wikipedia, &#34;The descriptive abstract, also known as the limited abstract or the indicative abstract, provides a description of what the paper covers without delving into its substance. A descriptive abstract is akin to a table of contents in paragraph form.&#34;<a id="id2752">
      ⁠</a><a xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" href="#ftn.id2752"></a>
		</p><div><p>
			A suitable abstract covers the high-level topics of the publication, and is probably a good place to mention the audience. It should cover the following basics: 
			</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
						What: What is the purpose of the publication or document? A brief summary, for example, &#34;The Red Hat Satellite 5.6 API Guide is a full reference for Satellite&#39;s XMRPC API.&#34;
					</p></li><li><p>
						How: How does the publication convey its content? That is, is it task-based? Example-driven? A reference guide? For example, &#34;The guide explains each API method and demonstrates examples of data models for input and output.&#34;
					</p></li><li><p>
						Why (and possibly Who): A basic rationale for why this publication exists, and its audience (and elaborate on the target audience inside the publication). For example, &#34;This publication provides a basis for administrators and developers to write custom scripts and to integrate Red Hat Satellite with third-party applications.&#34;
					</p></li></ul></div>

		</div><p>
			Drawing these basics together might produce the following example abstract:
		</p><p>
			&#34;The Red Hat Satellite 5.6 API Guide is a full reference for Satellite&#39;s XMRPC API. The guide explains each API method and demonstrates examples of data models for input and output. This publication provides a basis for administrators and developers to write custom scripts and to integrate Red Hat Satellite with third-party applications.&#34;
		</p><p>
			Update or modify each component according to the type of publication that you are writing.
		</p></div><div><p>
			The term &#34;introduction&#34; on its own is sufficiently vague, and raises enough questions in translation and with translation memory tools, that Red Hat technical documentation does not use this term on its own. Instead, use the phrase &#34;Introduction to &lt;product_name&gt;&#34; near the beginning of the publication to introduce the reader to the product. Do not use &#34;Introduction&#34; to introduce the publication; that is the task of the Abstract. A further benefit of this usage is that the same introduction can be used across various books to introduce the same product.
		</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3><a id="heading-placement">
      ⁠</a>3.1.5. Placement of Headings</h3></div></div></div><p>
			Do not include two consecutive headings without intervening text. Each heading must be followed by one or more paragraphs of text. If it is difficult to provide meaningful intervening text, then consider whether one of the headings is unnecessary.
		</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3><a id="unused-heading-titles">
      ⁠</a>3.1.6. Unused Heading Titles</h3></div></div></div><p>
			This section lists various heading titles that might be used in Red Hat technical documentation, but that should be avoided except in specific circumstances.
		</p><div><p><a id="overview">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Overview</p><p>
				Use &#34;Overview&#34; in a title only sparingly, and do not use &#34;Overview&#34; as a title on its own. No justification was found for using it as a title; anywhere that it might be considered is already covered by either better or more common titles.
			</p></div><div><p><a id="about">
      ⁠</a></p><p>About</p><p>
				Do not use &#34;about&#34; or &#34;about &lt;topic&gt;&#34; as a title. The same reasoning applies here as to &#34;overview&#34;.
			</p></div><div><p><a id="chap-sect-intros">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Chapter and Section Introductions</p><p>
				Do not create separate introductions for chapters and sections. Use any material that would constitute an introductory section to form body text following the chapter or section title.
			</p></div></div></div><div><p>
			This section covers various aspects of heading styles and design. If your company or organization has specific requirements in this regard, follow those requirements first.
		</p><div><p><a id="capitalization">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Capitalization</p><p>
				The standard for technical documentation is title case for all headings and titles.  Table titles and procedure titles fall into this category; standard title case capitalization rules apply.
			</p></div><p>
			Use title case also when referring to the titles of other publications, even if the title on the publication itself uses different casing.
		</p><p>
			Use sentence case for figure captions, legends, diagram labels, and table column headers. They are not classified as titles.
		</p><div><p>Punctuation</p><p>
				Be frugal with punctuation. Avoid semicolons, colons, dashes, and similar punctuation unless part of the actual subject, or a proper name. Do not use terminating periods.
			</p></div><div><p><a id="verbs-titles">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Writing Effective Titles</p><p>
				Use a title that represents the content.
			</p></div><p>
			Typically, the &#34;ing&#34; form of a verb is a good way to title larger chunks of content such as chapters and sections, for example &#34;Creating Branches&#34;. Choose a verb that refers to specific actions that users take, such as &#34;Configuring&#34;, &#34;Creating&#34;, &#34;Installing&#34;, and &#34;Merging&#34;.
		</p><p>
			Activities and subtasks that the user should perform can alternatively use an imperative verb for clarity. Imperative verbs are prescriptive, such as &#34;Create&#34; or &#34;Delete&#34;. Example: &#34;Assess the Health of an OpenShift Cluster&#34;.
		</p><p>
			In some cases, a verb might not be appropriate because the content is purely informational. Instead of using a vague verb like &#34;Understanding&#34;, &#34;Describing&#34;, &#34;Introducing&#34;, or &#34;Exploring&#34;, either use a more specific verb, or use a noun phrase instead of a verb. A noun phrase is descriptive and omits a verb, for example &#34;OpenShift Operators&#34; or &#34;The OpenShift Web Console.&#34;
		</p><p>
			Avoid a title that consists of only one word.
		</p><div><p><a id="id2804">
      ⁠</a></p><p><strong>Table 3.1. </strong></p><div><table xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" summary=""><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th> Example </th><th> Improvement </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Understanding OpenShift Users and Groups </td><td> OpenShift Users and Groups </td></tr><tr><td> Introducing Cluster Updates </td><td> Cluster Updates </td></tr><tr><td> MetalLB </td><td> The MetalLB Component </td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>
			In training content, avoid using a verb such as &#34;Discussing&#34; or &#34;Demonstrating&#34; in objectives for students. Such verbs might refer instead to what the instructor or the course content covers, or to a student group activity in class.
		</p><div><p>File Names, Commands, and Related Terms</p><p>
				When creating chapter and section titles, do not include file, command, or similar names, and generally do not include markup elements. Instead, focus on the task at hand and introduce the required file and command names in the text. Including such objects in titles is generally considered poor technical writing practice. Depending on how your documentation is built and delivered, including these object types can result in unpredictable results and can even cause failed builds.
			</p></div><div><p><a id="id2830">
      ⁠</a></p><p><strong>Table 3.2. </strong></p><div><table xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" summary=""><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><thead><tr><th> Example </th><th> Improvement </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> Custom Domains and cert-manager Operators with ROSA </td><td> Custom Domains and Certificate Management Operators with ROSA </td></tr></tbody></table></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2><a id="documenting-fonts">
      ⁠</a>3.3. Documenting Fonts</h2></div></div></div><p>
			The preferred way to refer to each type of PostScript font is &#34;PostScript Type x&#34;, substituting &#34;x&#34; with either 1, 2, or 3, if the problem is specific to a particular type.
		</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2><a id="documenting-ui">
      ⁠</a>3.4. Documenting the User Interface</h2></div></div></div><p>
			For initial guidance in all cases, refer to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=elements-ui"><em>UI Elements</em></a> in <em>IBM Style</em> <span><strong>
			<span><img src="https://brian.abelson.live/log/2025/07/05/images/padlock.png"/></span>
			</strong></span>. The following sections highlight exceptions or cases that might otherwise cause confusion.
		</p><p>
			When writing about items in a user interface (UI), match the capitalization and spelling of those items from the interface. However, if the interface contains a spelling error, then correct the spelling in your writing, and get the interface corrected if possible. Depending on the context, an option might be to write around an incorrectly spelled interface item rather than naming it specifically.
		</p><div><div><div><div><h3><a id="gui-elements-punctuation">
      ⁠</a>3.4.1. User Interface Elements and Punctuation</h3></div></div></div><p>
				When describing UI elements, do not include punctuation that appears on those elements, unless omission of that punctuation might lead to confusion.
			</p><p>
				For example, for a button labeled <span><strong>Save As...</strong></span>, do not include the ellipsis in the documentation.
			</p><p>
				Avoid including the element type in instructions. For example, rather than &#34;Click the <span><strong>Save</strong></span> button&#34;, write &#34;Click <span><strong>Save</strong></span>&#34;.
			</p><p>
				In some cases it is preferred practice to include the object type for the sake of clarity. Consider the following example:
			</p><div><p><a id="id2866">
      ⁠</a></p><p><strong>Example 3.1. Preferred Style for Documenting Icons</strong></p><div><p>
					Click the <span><strong>Upload</strong></span> (<span><strong>

			</p><div><div><div><div><h4><a id="id2882">
      ⁠</a>3.4.1.1. Moving Through Multiple UI Options</h4></div></div></div><p>
					Use &#34;go to&#34; when moving through multiple UI options because it covers all cases where you might have to click, point to, press, select, or otherwise make a series of selections to start an action.
				</p><p>
					For example, &#34;From the OpenShift web console, go to Monitoring → Metrics and enter the following metrics as queries.&#34;

				The following specific conventions apply to using captions and callouts with figures in Red Hat technical documentation, and are generally recommended.
			</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
						If the image is well documented and described in the surrounding text, no caption or callouts are required.
					</p></li><li><p>
						If the image is not fully described in the surrounding text, use a caption or legend to complete the information for the reader.
					</p></li><li><p>
						If the image is complex and requires detailed explanation, consider using callouts to describe each of the relevant parts.
					</p></li></ul></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
					Do not use callouts and captions on the same figure.

      ⁠</a>3.4.3. Starting Applications from the Desktop</h3></div></div></div><p>
				This section describes how to start applications from a Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based distribution.
			</p><p>
				RHEL 8 uses the following approach to starting applications from the desktop. To maintain consistency and to make translation easier, Red Hat documentation assumes the use of GNOME Classic, the default user interface, and prefers a consistent approach to instructing customers how to start applications.
			</p><p>
				The preferred approach is to use the <span><strong>Super</strong></span> key to enter the Activities Overview, to enter the name of the required application, and to press <span><strong>Enter</strong></span>. The <span><strong>Super</strong></span> key appears in various guises, depending on the keyboard and other hardware, but often as either the <span>Windows</span> or <span>Command</span> key, and typically to the left of the <span><strong>Spacebar</strong></span>. For example:
			</p><div><p><a id="exam-starting-apps">
      ⁠</a></p><p><strong>Example 3.2. Preferred Approach to Starting Applications from the Desktop</strong></p><div><p>

      ⁠</a>3.4.4. Documenting Command Terminology and Syntax</h3></div></div></div><p>
				Sufficient variation exists in the terminology that is used to describe commands, options, arguments, and so on that only general advice is provided here.
			</p><p>
				When referring to the command line as specified by Bash and POSIX, follow the terminology that the software uses. Never use &#34;flag&#34; when referring to command-line options in POSIX, even though Microsoft often uses the term &#34;flag&#34; when referring to single-character options in Microsoft Windows.
			</p><p>
				The following extract from <code>info libc</code> is of particular interest here:
			</p><div><blockquote><p>
					&#34;POSIX recommends these conventions for command line arguments. [...] Arguments are options if they begin with a hyphen delimiter (&#39;-&#39;). Multiple options may follow a hyphen delimiter in a single token if the options do not take arguments. Thus, &#39;-abc&#39; is equivalent to &#39;-a -b -c&#39;. [...] Certain options require an argument. For example, the &#39;-o&#39; option of the &#39;ld&#39; command requires an argument—an output file name&#34;. and so on.
				</p><p>
					Refer to <code>info libc argument syntax</code> for the full discussion.
				</p></blockquote></div><p>

					Avoid using the <code>--force (-f)</code> and <code>--assumeyes (-y)</code> options on most commands, especially when logged in as the <code>root</code> user. This can lead to unintended consequences, such as removing files or directories by mistake or installing packages or other software that might not suit your system. Refer to the following examples:
				</p><pre>[root@serverc pam.d]# rm -f system-auth password-auth
[root@serverc ~]# yum install -y new-package
</pre><p>
					In these examples, omit the <code>-f</code> and <code>-y</code> options, respectively.

						The following guidance differs from previous guidance on the subject.
					</p></div></div><p>
					Sometimes you need to show how to use long commands that extend over two or more lines, or that include several commands in a single example. If the commands are relatively short and straightforward, then include the commands on consecutive lines.
				</p><div><p><a id="id3015">
      ⁠</a></p><p><strong>Example 3.5. Documenting Multiple Commands</strong></p><div><pre>$ cd Documents

					If the commands are long, complex, or wrap over multiple lines, then use the following design: 
				</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
							Use line continuation characters without the associated PS2 prompts.
						</p></li><li><p>
							On Linux and macOS operating systems, use the Linux shell continuation character (\).
						</p></li><li><p>
							On Windows operating systems, use the backtick character (`).
						</p></li><li><p>
							For content that is potentially used in multiple operating systems, use the Linux shell continuation character, and include an explanatory sentence before the command.
						</p></li></ul></div><p>
					Do not use manual line indentation for the second and subsequent lines of commands. For some output formats, no control is possible over where lines would break, and any indentation might appear as extra spaces in inelegant places.

					For the sake of brevity, do not show all output to the user in all cases, but only those parts of any output that are relevant to the context that is described. Where output is not included, place a marker to show that information is purposely excluded. When shortening the output, use a consistent notation. For omitting entire horizontal lines of output, Red Hat uses the <span><em>...output omitted...</em></span> notation, starting and ending with an ellipsis, and highlighted in italics.

      ⁠</a>3.4.4.3. Referring to Replaceable Paths</h4></div></div></div><p>
					To refer to a path that users need to replace with something that is specific to their system, use the appropriate markup for your content, the correct syntax for the system and object in question, and an indicative name. Use a leading slash if the absolute path is required.
				</p><div><p><a id="id3056">
      ⁠</a></p><p><strong>Example 3.9. Referring to Replaceable Paths on Linux Systems</strong></p><div><p>
						&#34;Mount the ISO file in <em>/path/to/iso/file</em>.&#34;

					Remember to use the appropriate syntax for the system that you are documenting or describing.

						&#34;Mount the ISO file in <em>C:\path\to\iso\file</em>.&#34;
					</p></div></div><p>
					If you are referring to a different object class or type with different delimiters, use the appropriate delimiters. For example:
				</p><p>
					A PATH variable for Bash might appear as <em>/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin</em>.
				</p><p>
					A package path in Lua might appear as <em>local.share.lua</em>.

      ⁠</a>3.4.5. Using Escalated Privileges Correctly</h3></div></div></div><p>
				The term <em>escalated privileges</em> refers to changing to a user whose privileges allow operations that a normal user cannot access. It also refers to temporarily changing the privileges of the current user to perfom those operations without changing user accounts.
			</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
					This section is aimed primarily at Red Hat Training course material, but the principles and guidelines apply equally in any environment.
				</p></div></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
					Although security is important, it is more important that classroom security does not unnecessarily distract from the immediate topic that is being taught.
				</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4><a id="id3079">
      ⁠</a>3.4.5.1. General Recommendations</h4></div></div></div><p>
					The following are <span><em>recommendations</em></span>, not rules. As in most matters, consistency is important. Do not swap between different approaches without reason. Choose which approach works best for your situation and use it consistently.
				</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
							In all cases, use the minimum required privilege level to achieve the task.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Use a consistent approach when giving instructions to change users. For example: &#34;Connect to the cluster node and become the <code>root</code> user.&#34;
						</p><p>
							Variations such as &#34;become <code>root</code>&#34; or similar are strongly discouraged.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Use <code>sudo</code> and <code>sudo -i</code> and set it up to work throughout all relevant systems. Do not use <code>su -</code> without good cause.
						</p></li><li><p>
							When a scattered minority of privileged commands occur in a mostly unprivileged exercise, use <code>sudo</code> on a per-command basis.
						</p></li><li><p>
							When the exercise is majority privileged, or has many privileged commands, use <code>sudo -i</code>, either at the beginning of the exercise, or at an appropriate step where the privileged commands begin.
						</p></li><li><p>
							In the narrative, do not show the use of <code>su</code> or <code>sudo</code>, but always show privileged commands with the correct prompt. Refer to <a href="#exam-documenting-command-syntax">Example 3.3, “Cloning a Git Repository”</a> for information about command prompts.
						</p></li></ul></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
						Some courses are specifically designed to teach <code>sudo</code> and its variations, the use of the related files, such as <code>/etc/sudoers</code>, and so on. For these courses, use the required variation for the topic that is being taught.
					</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4><a id="id3111">
      ⁠</a>3.4.5.2. Ansible Courses</h4></div></div></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
							Ansible courses typically use a <code>devops</code> user with passwordless sudo access (<code>devops ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL</code>) on managed nodes to enable the use of <code>become</code> without a <code>become</code> password as <code>root</code> to do anything.
						</p></li><li><p>
							As much as possible, configure the default setting for <code>become</code> to <code>false</code>. If a single task needs privileges, then set <code>become: true</code> on that task.
						</p></li><li><p>
							If most tasks in a play require escalated privileges, then set the entire play to <code>become: true</code> and selectively set individual tasks that do not need escalated privileges to <code>become: false</code>.
						</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3><a id="view-edit-files">
      ⁠</a>3.4.6. Describing How to View and Edit Files</h3></div></div></div><p>
				To describe how to view and edit files, such as configuration files, scripts, and so on, do not include editor names as part of the guidance, unless the topic is about a specific editor, or is otherwise necessary to achieve a wanted result.
			</p><p>
				For example, do not refer to <code>cat</code> or <code>vi</code> if you need to tell readers to &#34;view the <code>my-script</code> file&#34;. If you need to tell readers to edit a file and add or remove content, write &#34;Edit the <code>my-script</code> file and add the following content:&#34; and then include the required content in a code block and highlight the text to change. Include some surrounding text in the file for context. Do not use line numbers as a reference point because they can change.
			</p><p>
				If the file to edit is empty or does not exist, do not highlight any content to add.
			</p><p>
				You can also use <code>here</code> documents to describe how to create a file with required content. For more information about <code>here</code> documents, refer to <a href="https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html">https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html</a> The syntax of <code>here</code> documents varies by system, shell, language, and so on. The following example creates the <code>my-script</code> file in the current directory, with the example content.
			</p><pre>$ cat &lt;&lt; EOF &gt; my-script
&gt; # The first line of text
&gt; # The second line
&gt; # Start adding variables after this line
&gt; EOF</pre><p>
				In some cases, it is necessary to indicate which tool to use to view a file, especially for log files and other long files. In these cases, suggest a viewer based on the operating system or environment in which you are working, such as <code>tail</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>less</code>, or <code>journalctl</code>.
			</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3><a id="use-hostnames-correctly">
      ⁠</a>3.4.7. Using Host and Usernames Correctly</h3></div></div></div><p>
				Many examples in Red Hat documentation require the use of usernames, hostnames, IP addresses, and similar information. To reduce security risks, to minimize translation overhead, and to maintain consistency, Red Hat recommends the following approach:
			</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
					All names are lowercase. Do not use white space in any part of the name.
				</p></div></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
						Use <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc2606">RFC 2606</a> to find suitable domain names. For documentation and example purposes, it is typically <code>example.com</code>, <code>example.net</code>, <code>example.org</code>, and <code>example.edu</code>.
					</p><div><div><p>
							Do not use valid, public IP addresses in any examples.
						</p></div></div></li><li><p>
						As much as possible, use <code>user</code>, <code>username</code>, <code>root</code>, <code>admin</code>, or similar names to identify classes of users.
					</p><p>
						Use these generic names when you refer to users outside a case study. It helps students to identify which part of a command to replace, by establishing a consistent format for names of users and system items. For example:
					</p><pre><code>[root@fedora ~]# </code><strong><code>setfacl -m u:user1:rw /project/file1</code></strong></pre><p>
						The following list provides further options:
					</p><div><ul><li><p><code>operator1</code> to <code>operator9</code>
							</p></li><li><p><code>developer1</code> to <code>developer9</code>
							</p></li><li><p><code>architect1</code> to <code>architect9</code>
							</p></li></ul></div></li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h4><a id="using-extended-names">
      ⁠</a>3.4.7.1. Using Extended User and Group Names</h4></div></div></div><p>
					Sometimes, the recommended list of user and group names is too restrictive for the scope of a publication or article. In such cases, the following extended model is acceptable.
				</p><div><p><a id="using-realistic-names">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Using Realistic Usernames</p><p>
						When you are writing a detailed case study, such as training exercises, reviews, and similar material, use realistic names. These names should not be real people. In other words, do not use the name of an employee, a well-known person, or your neighbor.
					</p></div><p>
					For example, you are the system administrator at Global Banking and you are asked to set up permissions to the accounting directory for the following users: Huong Sabo, Jolene Paluch, Abby Quincy, Francis Ritcher, and Jaya Lamont. Huong is a department manager and needs read access to the accounting directory. Jolene is the lead accountant and needs both read and write access.
				</p><div><p><a id="choosing-realistic-names">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Choosing a Realistic Name</p><p>
						Consider the following points when choosing a realistic name:
					</p></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
							In examples or scenarios, you can use a person&#39;s name and then use a gender-specific pronoun to refer to that name. Vary the use of proper names in documentation. Use names that represent various ethnic backgrounds, genders, and locations.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Include a diverse set of names in your examples to reflect the diversity of the real world. For example, use gender-inclusive and culturally diverse names that suggest various backgrounds in examples to avoid implying that only certain groups have specific skills.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Do not use copyrighted fictional characters in examples, and do not use real people.
						</p></li><li><p>
							When choosing names, also consider how those names might appear in email addresses, usernames, and similar contexts. Avoid name combinations or abbreviations that result in unintended meanings, such as slang. An example that works well might be &#34;John Smith&#34;, with an email address of <code><a href="mailto:jsmith@example.com">jsmith@example.com</a></code>. However, for the name &#34;Brian Strong&#34;, a corresponding email address of <code><a href="mailto:bstrong@example.com">bstrong@example.com</a></code> might not work so well (when read out, it sounds like &#34;be strong&#34;). Consider also any implications for names in different languages.
						</p></li></ul></div><div><p><a id="sourcing-realistic-names">

				When naming an object, consider the impact of its name when writing about the object. Avoid duplication, alliteration, or long names. In cases where including the class in an object name helps to provide clarity, avoid including the object&#39;s class in the last part of its name. This approach avoids repetition when writing about the object where the noun that follows the object name indicates its class.

			This section defines abbreviations, acronyms, initialisms, and special characters.
		</p><div><p><a id="abbreviations">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Abbreviations</p><p>
				An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. For example, <abbr>Pty.</abbr> and <abbr>Inc.</abbr> are abbreviations for &#34;proprietary&#34; and &#34;incorporated&#34;, respectively. Read them as the word for which they are an abbreviation.
			</p></div><div><p><a id="acronyms">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Acronyms</p><p>
				An acronym is a word that is formed from the initial letters of a name, such as ROM for <span><em>R</em></span>ead-<span><em>O</em></span>nly <span><em>M</em></span>emory, or by combining initial letters or part of a series of words, such as LILO for <span><em>LI</em></span>nux <span><em>LO</em></span>ader. </p><acronym>COBOL</acronym><p> is the acronym for Common Business-oriented Language, and </p><acronym>POP</acronym><p> is the acronym for Post Office Protocol.
			</p></div><div><p><a id="initialisms">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Initialisms</p><p>
				An initialism is an abbreviation that consists of the first letters of words in a phrase, syllables, or some combination thereof. Each character is pronounced separately. For example, FTP is an initialism for File Transfer Protocol.

				This section describes how to use abbreviations, acronyms, initialisms, and special characters correctly in Red Hat documentation.
			</p><div><p><a id="first-mentions">
      ⁠</a></p><p>First Mentions</p><p>
					Spell out most acronyms and initialisms before using them in text, such as &#34;The Embedded DevKit (EDK) ...&#34;. Unless required for the audience or the topic, do not spell out well-known initialisms, such as HTML.
				</p></div><div><p><a id="cap">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Capitalization</p><p>
					Unless the acronym or initialism stands for a proper noun, use sentence case for the spelled out version: for example, &#34;central processing unit (CPU)&#34;. Not all acronyms are capitalized (for example, &#34;spool&#34;); refer to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=grammar-capitalization"><em>Capitalization</em></a> in <em>IBM Style</em> <span><strong>
					<span><img src="https://brian.abelson.live/log/2025/07/05/images/padlock.png"/></span>
					</strong></span> or to another suitable reference if you are unsure.
				</p></div><div><p><a id="articles">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Articles</p><p>
					When deciding which articles to use, consider pronunciation. For example, use &#34;an <abbr>RTS</abbr> (real-time strategy)&#34;, because <abbr>RTS</abbr> is an initialism and you pronounce the first character as an &#34;R&#34; (är). Conversely, use &#34;a </p><acronym>RAM</acronym><p> upgrade&#34;, because </p><acronym>RAM</acronym><p> is an acronym and you pronounce it as a word (răm).
				</p></div><div><p><a id="plurals">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Plurals</p><p>
					To form the plural of an acronym, add a trailing, lowercase &#34;s&#34; or &#34;es&#34; without an apostrophe, for example, ROMs, PINs, BIOSes.
				</p></div><div><p><a id="special-characters">
      ⁠</a></p><p>Special Characters</p><p>
					Consider pronunciation when referring to file or directory names that begin with special characters, and use the correct indefinite article.
				</p></div><p>
				If a file or directory name begins with a special character, such as an underscore, then you need to pronounce that character.
			</p><p>
				For example, using &#34;an <code>_build/</code> directory&#34; is correct, because you pronounce &#34;an underscore build directory&#34;.
			</p><p>
				Using &#34;a <code>-compile/</code> directory&#34; is correct, because you pronounce &#34;a dash compile directory&#34;.
			</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2><a id="product-names">
      ⁠</a>3.7. Using Company, Product, and Brand Names Correctly</h2></div></div></div><p>
			Various restrictions apply to using company, product, and brand names in Red Hat documentation. Refer to internal sources for further conditions that might apply to your own products.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
				In the following sections, &#34;first use&#34; refers to the first use of a name in body text. Titles, banners, and similar objects are not classified as &#34;first use&#34;.
			</p></div></div><p>
			Restrictions apply to abbreviating Red Hat product or solution names in public-facing documents. Always use the full name on first use. For some products, for example Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, you can omit &#34;Red Hat&#34; after the first use.
		</p><p>
			Further restrictions apply to using acronyms and initialisms. In this same example, and only in technical documentation, &#34;RHOCP&#34; is acceptable after the first use of the full product name.
		</p><p>
			Do not include &#34;Inc.&#34; when referring to Red Hat except in legal documents.
		</p><p>
			Do not use articles in front of product names. For example, do not write &#34;the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform was ...&#34;.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
				In this case, &#34;Platform&#34; is part of the product name. In other cases, words like &#34;platform&#34;, &#34;manager&#34;, and so on might not be part of the product name, in which case an article is acceptable, if not necessary.
			</p></div></div><p>
			Do not use possessives to refer to product names. For examples and more information, refer to <a href="#possessives">Section 2.4, “Possessives”</a>.
		</p><p>
			Do not hyphenate or break a product name across lines.
		</p><div><p><a id="id3463">
      ⁠</a></p><p><strong>Example 3.11. Incorrect Example of Line Breaking</strong></p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2><a id="nonbreaking-spaces">
      ⁠</a>3.8. Using Non-breaking Spaces</h2></div></div></div><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
				The following guidance about using non-breaking spaces applies only to the Red Hat company name and to Red Hat products. Do not use non-breaking spaces with other companies&#39; product names.
			</p></div></div><p>
			To keep text together on the same line, use a non-breaking space in the following situations:
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					In the company name, between &#34;Red&#34; and &#34;Hat&#34;.
				</p></li><li><p>
					In a product name, between the last word and a version number.
				</p></li><li><p>
					Between a numeral and a unit of measurement.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			Examples (for AsciiDoc):
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
					Red{nbsp}Hat Enterprise Linux{nbsp}8
				</p></li><li><p>
					Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift Container Platform{nbsp}4.9
				</p></li><li><p>
					The <code>crashkernel=auto</code> setting requires at least 1{nbsp}GB of memory.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			If you are working with images or other objects where space is especially tight, this rule is more flexible, but &#34;Red Hat&#34; should never be broken over two lines.
		</p><p>
			Non-breaking spaces are not needed elsewhere in a product name and might cause undesirable line-breaking behavior. In particular, do not use non-breaking spaces between extended components of Red Hat product names. For example, &#34;Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform&#34; does not require a non-breaking space between any of the words after &#34;Red Hat&#34;.
		</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2><a id="version-numbers">
      ⁠</a>3.9. Using Version Numbers Correctly</h2></div></div></div><div><p>
			The preferred format for product names includes only the major version number. For example: 
			</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
						Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
					</p></li><li><p>
						JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 3
					</p></li></ul></div>

		</div><p>
			When writing about a product line, product release, or product family, use major version numbers. It includes all the releases (past, present, and future) of that major version.
		</p><div><p>
			Only use minor version numbers when you are referring to a specific minor release, or to a feature that is specific to that minor release. For example: 
			</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
						Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2 was released on October 12, 2010.
					</p></li><li><p>
						&lt;Application name&gt; was first included in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 3.2.
					</p></li></ul></div>

		</div><p>
			Major changes usually take place in major version releases, and are carried through any minor updates to that release. If you are referring to a major change, or to the first appearance of a new technology, it is therefore most accurate to refer to the major release.
		</p><p>
			Avoid using the &#34;dot-oh&#34; release number. For example, do not use Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0. Use instead Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
				This rule applies only to Red Hat products. Refer to other companies&#39; products and use their version numbers as they use them.
			</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2><a id="admonitions">
      ⁠</a>3.10. Using Admonitions</h2></div></div></div><p>
			To call attention to a statement, use an admonition. Red Hat technical documentation currently uses <code>Note</code>, <code>Important</code>, and <code>Warning</code> admonitions.
		</p><div><p>
			Depending on the tools and workflow, admonitions might automatically include a suitable title according to the type of admonition. Do not use a phrase or anything else for the title. Keep the following considerations in mind if using admonitions: 
			</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
						Keep statements brief and to the point.
					</p></li><li><p>
						Use admonitions sparingly so that they do not lose their effectiveness.
					</p></li><li><p>
						Use a <code>Note</code> admonition to bring extra information to the user&#39;s attention.
					</p></li><li><p>
						Use an <code>Important</code> admonition to show the user a piece of information that should not be overlooked. This information might not change anything that the user is doing, but it should show the user that this piece of information could be vital.
					</p></li><li><p>
						Use a <code>Warning</code> admonition to alert the reader to potential changes, such as files being removed, and not to perform the operation unless fully aware of the consequences.

		Red Hat produces documentation for a global audience, and in many cases this documentation is translated into many languages. To reach the widest possible audience, and to make the task of translation as straightforward as possible, avoid slang and other culture-specific terminology. This chapter attempts to identify commonly used slang terms and phraseology, and to provide alternatives.

		If you find slang terms or other difficult-to-understand passages in our documentation, use this section to search for alternatives.

      ⁠</a>4.1. Avoiding Misleading or Confusing Language</h2></div></div></div><p>
			Some terms, phrases, and general language can be confusing if you are not a native speaker or if the phraseology has regional significance. Sometimes spelling changes are introduced over time and regions, based purely on differences in pronunciation. Some phrases can carry hidden or unintentional meanings. This section attempts to introduce a few examples.
		</p><div><dl><dt><span>best practices</span></dt><dd><p>
						This is a commonly understood phrase, and despite some concerns about using superlatives without statistics to back them up, Red Hat does not actively discourage its use. It is also a more common search term than most alternatives. If you are in any doubt, the preferred alternative is &#34;recommended practices&#34;.
					</p></dd><dt><a id="first-come-first-served">
      ⁠</a><span>first come, first served</span></dt><dd><p>
						Indicates that customers will be attended to in the order that they arrive. The phrase abbreviates the sentence &#34;The first to come is the first to be served&#34;, so use &#34;served&#34; instead of &#34;serve&#34; to keep the verb function the same. This phrase is an idiom, so avoid using it when content will be translated. When you use this phrase as an adjective, it is hyphenated as follows: Admittance is on a first-come, first-served basis.

						Jargon. Say exactly what you mean, for example, &#34;the best product in its class&#34; or &#34;the best product of its type&#34;. Other alternatives include best, foremost, most advanced, and optimum. The category is usually implied. Be wary of using superlatives without data to back up any claims.

					</p></dd><dt><span>eat your own dogfood</span></dt><dd></dd><dt><span>enterprise-ready</span></dt><dd><p>
						Although Red Hat used to use this term to emphasize its products&#39; enterprise readiness, it is not as necessary now, especially when talking about a product with &#34;Enterprise&#34; in its name, unless you are calling this out as a key selling point.
					</p></dd><dt><span>exceed your expectations</span></dt><dd><p>
						Vague. Clarify with specifics, for example, &#34;The movie made more money on the opening weekend than anyone expected.&#34; instead of &#34;The movie exceeded our expectations.&#34;
					</p></dd><dt><span>fib</span></dt><dd><p>
						A fib is a &#34;small lie&#34;, also known as a &#34;white lie&#34;. For example, &#34;This command tells fibs&#34; is better written as &#34;The output of this command can be misleading&#34;.

						Do not use.
					</p></dd><dt><span>frown upon</span></dt><dd><p>
						&#34;To frown upon&#34; means to hold in low regard, not to approve of, and so on. For example: &#34;... we generally frown on the use of session context ...&#34;. This translates to (and should have been written as) &#34;... the use of session context is not recommended ...&#34; (or words to that effect).
					</p></dd><dt><span>fuzzy (search)</span></dt><dd><p>
						Even though &#34;fuzzy&#34; is slang, it is common when referring to searches, especially in databases. This example came from the Directory Server documentation:
					</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
								In Directory Server, if you do a fuzzy search for &#34;Smith&#34;, you will probably also get &#34;Smyth&#34;, because it sounds the same.
							</p></li></ul></div><p>
						The use of &#34;fuzzy&#34; is valid in this context.
					</p><p>
						Note the difference between this and &#34;wildcard&#34; searches: &#34;Sm?th&#34; could return &#34;Smith&#34;, &#34;Smyth&#34;, &#34;Smeth&#34;, or even &#34;Smrth&#34;.
					</p><p>
						Do not use &#34;fuzzy&#34; to describe something that is not clear, such as an image, a concept, an idea, and so on. For example, &#34;He was a bit fuzzy on the details&#34; is not valid.
					</p></dd><dt><span>going-forward basis</span></dt><dd><p>
						Jargon. Say &#34;from now on&#34;, &#34;in the future&#34;, or something similar.
					</p></dd><dt><span>happy path</span></dt><dd><p>
						Do not use. Often understood to mean &#34;a path or method of least resistance&#34; or &#34;the preferred way to solve the current issue&#34;, this is localized slang and could easily be misunderstood. It could also produce problems for translation.
					</p></dd><dt><span>harness the power</span></dt><dd><p>
						Do not use.
					</p></dd><dt><span>have a crack at, jump right in</span></dt><dd><p>
						Have a crack at and jump right in are closely related in meaning as they imply to &#34;get started or give it a try&#34;. Alternatives to these are &#34;start&#34;, &#34;try&#34;, and &#34;begin&#34;, and will depend on the context of what is being discussed.
					</p></dd><dt><span>if you want, if you wish</span></dt><dd><p>
						Do not use. For example, instead of saying &#34;If you want to perform an action, ...&#34; say &#34;To perform an action, ...&#34;.
					</p></dd><dt><span>in concert with</span></dt><dd><p>
						Do not use. Instead, say &#34;with&#34;. For example, change &#34;Use gcov in concert with GCC to analyze ...&#34; to &#34;Use gcov with GNU CC to analyze ...&#34;
					</p></dd><dt><span>improve, enhance</span></dt><dd><p>

						Commonly used in the expression &#34;a different kettle of fish&#34;, meaning &#34;that is a different matter (altogether)&#34;. Depending on the context, use &#34;topic&#34;, &#34;subject&#34;, &#34;matter&#34;, or something similar.
					</p></dd><dt><span>leverage</span></dt><dd><p>
						Avoid. Alternatives include &#34;use&#34; and &#34;take advantage of&#34;.
					</p></dd><dt><span>lights on, lights-on</span></dt><dd><p>
						Avoid using this term, because 1) it is jargon, 2) not everyone knows what it means, and 3) the meaning could be lost or confused in translation to other languages.
					</p><p>
						It is typically used to mean maintaining the <span><em>status quo</em></span> or just doing what is required to keep things up and running (versus being proactive and innovative). For example, &#34;A cloud can deliver strategic advantages to the business by redirecting resources from lights-on to innovation.&#34;
					</p></dd><dt><span>low-hanging fruit</span></dt><dd><p>
						Metaphor. Do not use. Instead, describe the outcome or opportunity in more precise terms, such as &#34;readily achievable goals&#34; or &#34;low-risk, high-yield opportunities&#34;.
					</p></dd><dt><span>meet your needs</span></dt><dd><p>
						Vague. Try to be more specific, for example, &#34;lower your middleware costs&#34;.
					</p></dd><dt><span>mission-critical</span></dt><dd><p>
						Overused and jargony. Unless the topic is actually critical to a mission, use a factual term or phrase, for example, &#34;Ensure that you have the applications that you need to help your customers.&#34; versus &#34;Ensure that you have the mission-critical applications that your customers demand.&#34;
					</p></dd><dt><span>net-net</span></dt><dd><p>
						Jargon. Use &#34;in summary&#34;, &#34;the end result&#34;, or something similar.
					</p></dd><dt><span>niche focus</span></dt><dd><p>
						Do not use.
					</p></dd><dt><span>on the same page</span></dt><dd><p>
						Instead of &#34;ensure that everyone is on the same page&#34;, use wording such as &#34;ensure that everyone is aligned&#34; or &#34;ensure that everyone is in agreement&#34;.
					</p></dd><dt><span>over the wire</span></dt><dd><p>
						Commonly used in expressions such as &#34;password information is sent in plain text over the wire&#34;, meaning &#34;sent unencrypted through the transmission medium&#34; (whether it is a wired or wireless network, the internet, or whatever). The phrase is probably not required at all. &#34;Sent or transmitted in plain text&#34; is fine.
					</p></dd><dt><span>paradigm</span></dt><dd><p>
						Avoid. Use &#34;model&#34;, &#34;standard&#34;, or something similar.
					</p></dd><dt><span>performant</span></dt><dd><p>
						In the technical industry context, it means &#34;performs as expected&#34; or &#34;well-performing&#34;. It is not necessarily a word everyone knows (and technically, it means &#34;a performer&#34;, as in a play, according to most dictionaries), so use an alternative if possible.
					</p></dd><dt><span>piggyback</span></dt><dd><p>
						Slang. Do not use.
					</p></dd><dt><span>pre-baked, prebaked</span></dt><dd><p>
						Means &#34;prepared beforehand&#34;. Choose a suitable alternative, such as &#34;preconfigured&#34;, depending on the context.
					</p></dd><dt><span>productize</span></dt><dd><p>
						Not a word. Find another way to say &#34;modify something to become suitable as a commercial product&#34;. [wiktionary]
					</p></dd><dt><span>ready to rumble</span></dt><dd><p>
						&#34;Let&#39;s get ready to rumble!&#34; is a trademarked catchphrase used to introduce televised boxing or wrestling events. In US English slang, being &#34;ready to rumble&#34; means you are &#34;ready to go ahead&#34; or &#34;ready to start&#34;.
					</p></dd><dt><span>rest on your laurels</span></dt><dd><p>
						Do not use.
					</p></dd><dt><span>right before doing something</span></dt><dd><p>
						Preferred phrase would be &#34;immediately before doing something&#34;. Otherwise, write around the phrase.
					</p></dd><dt><span>root your server in the <code>/serverRoot</code> directory</span></dt><dd><p>
						This expression is inelegant. Be aware of the multiple meanings of words. Try something like &#34;Use the <code>/serverRoot</code> directory as the root directory for your server.&#34;
					</p></dd><dt><span>shoot yourself in the foot</span></dt><dd><p>
						To &#34;shoot yourself in the foot&#34; indicates that you did something to harm your own cause, or acting against your own best interests. Remove the sentence; it should be self-evident from the surrounding information.
					</p></dd><dt><span>shy of</span></dt><dd><p>
						Apart from the &#34;normal&#34; meaning of shy, it is also found in such phrases as &#34;he was just shy of the mark&#34;, meaning that he did not quite succeed. Also, to be &#34;a few items shy of what is required&#34; means to have fewer than the minimum required number. Avoid this terminology and use more easily understood terms; it helps translators and also those reading English documentation who are unfamiliar with such slang.
					</p></dd><dt><span>silo, siloed</span></dt><dd><p>
						Use &#34;stand-alone&#34;, &#34;confined&#34;, &#34;separated&#34;, or something similar.
					</p></dd><dt><span>solutions-based</span></dt><dd><p>
						Do not use.
					</p></dd><dt><span>solution stack</span></dt><dd><p>
						Do not use.
					</p></dd><dt><span>stovepipe</span></dt><dd><p>
						Jargon. In business, related to lack of cross-organizational communication, similar to &#34;silo&#34;.
					</p></dd><dt><span>synergistic, synergy</span></dt><dd><p>
						Jargon. Use &#34;cooperative&#34;, &#34;working together&#34;, &#34;collaborative&#34;, &#34;harmonious&#34;, or something similar.
					</p></dd><dt><span>to think outside the box</span></dt><dd><p>
						Use &#34;think creatively&#34; or &#34;think unconventionally&#34; or rephrase completely.
					</p></dd><dt><span>tunnel vision</span></dt><dd><p>
						Do not use.
					</p></dd><dt><span>under the covers</span></dt><dd><p>
						This refers to something being out of plain sight or not immediately obvious. For example, you might only see the results of some action or command, but what happens &#34;under the covers&#34; is what is going on in the background, that you cannot see or are not aware of, to make that action of command possible.
					</p></dd><dt><span>value-added</span></dt><dd><p>
						Jargon. Say &#34;added value&#34; or &#34;valuable&#34;. Or be more specific, for example, &#34;adds value by improving productivity&#34;.
					</p></dd><dt><span>very</span></dt><dd><p>
						Use with caution. For example, there is little value in saying &#34;very cost-effective&#34; versus &#34;cost-effective&#34;.
					</p></dd><dt><span>virtual elephants</span></dt><dd><p>
						This refers to a group of blind-folded people all touching different parts of an elephant and trying to describe what it is. Nobody sees the &#34;big picture&#34;. Curiously, it appeared in an STC article about working in global and virtual teams and using effective communication. It falls into the same category as &#34;skeletons in the closet&#34;, &#34;dark horse&#34;, &#34;black sheep&#34;, and so on. Use descriptions and adjectives that are not specific to a particular culture or locale. Refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Men-anElephant">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Men-anElephant</a> for more information.

      ⁠</a>4.6. Inclusive Language</h2></div></div></div><p>
			Chris Wright, Red Hat Chief Technology Officer and Senior Vice President, Global Engineering, affirms in a blog post a commitment for Red Hat to identify and replace problematic language that is potentially divisive and does not foster inclusion:
		</p><p>
			Follow these guiding principles:
		</p><p>
			Do not use the terms &#34;white&#34; or &#34;black&#34; in a context where white is represented as good or black is represented as bad, such as &#34;whitelist&#34; and &#34;blacklist&#34;. Such usage reinforces a model that promotes racial bias.
		</p><p>
			For alternatives, choose words that describe the action that is taken or the function that is performed, rather than a metaphor for that action or function, for example &#34;allowlist&#34; instead of &#34;whitelist&#34;, or &#34;blocklist&#34; or &#34;denylist&#34; instead of &#34;blacklist&#34;.
		</p><p>
			Do not use &#34;master&#34; when it is paired with &#34;slave&#34;. The master and slave mount propagation terminology that is used in Linux is problematic and divisive, and needs to be changed. When naming the default branch name for a GitHub repository, use &#34;main&#34; instead of &#34;master&#34;. Use of &#34;master&#34; is acceptable in other contexts, such as to refer to mastery of a skill.
		</p><p>
			Avoid gender bias. As an example, do not assume that the subject of a sentence is male if the context might refer to any gender. Thus, instead of using &#34;man hours&#34;, use &#34;labor hours&#34; or &#34;person hours&#34;. Avoid binary gendered language, such as &#34;he&#34; or &#34;she&#34;, except to refer to a specific named person. Do not use &#34;he or she&#34;. Instead, use the ungendered &#34;they&#34; as the preferred pronoun.
		</p><p>
			Avoid neurodiversity bias. For example, avoid the terms &#34;sanity check&#34; and &#34;sanity test&#34;, and do not use &#34;disabled&#34; to refer to a person.
		</p><p>
			Avoid superlatives in job titles and descriptions, especially problematic terms such as &#34;guru&#34;, &#34;ninja&#34;, &#34;rockstar&#34;, or &#34;evangelist&#34;.
		</p><p>
			Such guidance, including judgement of what constitutes acceptable versus unacceptable use, will evolve over time.
		</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2><a id="redundant">
      ⁠</a>4.7. Avoiding Redundant Words</h2></div></div></div><p>
			Avoid redundant words, such as &#34;actually&#34;, &#34;really&#34;, &#34;simply&#34;, and &#34;very&#34;. They are typically filler words that add no value to a sentence.
		</p><p>
			Redundant words might also occur where two words or phrases are used that mean approximately the same thing, such as &#34;revert back&#34; versus &#34;revert&#34;, or that add nothing to the sentence, such as &#34;located on&#34; versus &#34;on&#34;.

			Exception: Use of an all-numeric representation is allowed when space is limited, as in a user interface, or to enhance readability. In such cases, use the ISO date format with a 4-digit year (YYYY-MM-DD) and define the format in a header or legend.
		</p><p>
			For times of day, use uppercase without periods, such as &#34;11 AM&#34;. Use a nonbreaking space between the numeral and &#34;AM&#34; or &#34;PM&#34;.
		</p><p>
			Use &#34;noon&#34; or &#34;12 noon&#34; instead of &#34;12 PM&#34;. Use &#34;midnight&#34; or &#34;12 midnight&#34; instead of &#34;12 AM&#34;.

			Spell out the following number types: numbers zero through nine, any number that begins a sentence, a number that precedes another number (four 6-pound bags; eleven 20-pound bags), approximations (thousands of ...), and very large values.
		</p><p>
			Use numerals for numbers 10 and greater, and for numbers less than 10 if they appear in the same paragraph as numbers of 10 or greater (for example, &#34;You answered 8 out of 14 questions correctly&#34;). Use numerals for negative numbers, fractions, percentages, decimals, measurements, and references to publication sections (for example, Chapter 3, Table 5, Page 11). Also use numerals when referring to registers (such as R1), code (such as x = 6), and release versions (such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, Linux kernel 4.18).
		</p><p>
			Do not use commas in numbers with four digits (use 1000 rather than 1,000). Use commas, to separate groups of three digits, in numbers with five or more digits (such as 10,000; 123,456,789; 1,000,000,000).

				Use spaces, not dashes or dots, to punctuate phone numbers. When indicating a number for international use, include the country code (+1 555 555 5555 for a US number, for example). US 800 numbers are not accessible from outside the country, so do not precede them with a country code (800 555 5555). Phone numbers beginning with 0 are not for international use. Make these numbers ready for international use by dropping the zero and adding the appropriate country code. For example, (055) 12345 would be for use in Italy only; change it to +39 (55) 12345 for international use.

      ⁠</a>5.1. Sentence Structure</h2></div></div></div><p>
			This section describes how to construct your content for clarity and readability. A full discussion of this topic is beyond the scope of this guide.
		</p><div><div><div><div><h3><a id="Sentence_Structure-Using_Lists_Correctly">
      ⁠</a>5.1.1. Using and Formatting Lists</h3></div></div></div><p>
				Lists appear in a range of formats, such as series, ordered, unordered (bulleted), and so on. Avoid using bulleted lists to format a single sentence. Some translation tools display list items and the introductory sentence (or <em>sentence stem</em>) as individual sentences for translation. If they are not complete sentences, they can be difficult to translate.
			</p><p>
				The following general guidelines apply to lists:
			</p><div><dl><dt><span>Bulleted lists</span></dt><dd><p>
							Use this list type when the order of items is not important. In most cases, a bulleted list should have three or more entries. In limited cases, specific publications might choose instead to allow fewer entries in a list. Titles are optional.
						</p></dd><dt><span>Ordered lists</span></dt><dd><p>
							These appear as numbered lists. Use this list type for multiple entries if you need to refer to one of the entries from elsewhere in your document, or where order is important. For example, use an ordered list for a sequence of steps to complete a task, or for a sequence of events. Titles are optional.
						</p></dd><dt><span>Variable lists</span></dt><dd><p>
							These appear as a list of terms followed by definitions. Use this list type to list and describe a series of terms, such as variables, command options or arguments, and similar items. Titles are optional. (This list is written as a variable list.) A variable list is often preferable to a table, because tables have the additional overhead of calculating column width for every translation. Tables are best reserved for information that relies on, or benefits greatly from, a grid layout.
						</p></dd><dt><span>Procedures</span></dt><dd><p>
							These appear as a list of numbered steps. Procedures always include a title, and are used to list the required steps to achieve a task.
						</p></dd></dl></div><p>
				You can nest lists, but try to keep the number of levels to two or fewer.
			</p><div><div><div><div><h4><a id="id4296">
      ⁠</a>5.1.1.1. Formatting Lists for Readability</h4></div></div></div><p>
					It is important to provide enough spacing between elements in your documents to facilitate reading and comprehension. You can include a lot of information in a few short paragraphs but readers need to be able to process that information in chunks. The same consideration applies to lists.
				</p><p>
					In some authoring environments, you can choose between normal or compact spacing for lists. Use a list with normal spacing if any list item contains the following components:
				</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
							Nested lists. Nested list items themselves can use the <code>compact</code> attribute if they fall outside the bounds of these recommendations.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Navigation or similar instructions (such as &#34;Go to Menu -&gt; Submenu&#34;).
						</p></li><li><p>
							Multiple paragraphs, or sentences that wrap to two or more lines.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Other sections where your deliverables might benefit from more spacing between list items, for example a list of objectives in a training course.
						</p></li></ul></div><p>
					Use a list with compact spacing in all other cases.
				</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
						The use of all but the simplest graphics in lists is strongly discouraged.
					</p></div></div><p>
					The following explanation provides some initial guidance for using lists correctly. For a detailed explanation, refer to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/ibm-style?topic=format-lists"><em>Lists</em></a> in <em>IBM Style</em> <span><strong>
					<span><img src="https://brian.abelson.live/log/2025/07/05/images/padlock.png"/></span>
					</strong></span>.
				</p><p>
					Do not insert a list midway through a sentence and then continue the sentence after the list.

					For a lead-in sentence that introduces a list, use a complete sentence. A lead-in that is a sentence fragment can be difficult to translate into other languages.

      ⁠</a>5.1.1.2. Punctuation in Lists</h4></div></div></div><p>
					For each item in a list, start with either a complete sentence or a sentence fragment.
				</p><p>
					A <span><em>complete sentence</em></span> must include a subject and a verb. It conveys a complete thought, and can stand on its own.
				</p><p>
					For a list where all items are complete sentences, end each item with a period.
				</p><p>
					Example:
				</p><p>
					Which statement is true about deployments and deployment configurations?
				</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
							Deployments use replica sets, and deployment configurations use replication controllers.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Deployments use replication controllers, and deployment configurations use replica sets.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Deployments and deployment configurations both refer to the same thing.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Deployments use replica sets, and deployment configurations use stateful sets.
						</p></li></ul></div><p>
					For a list where all items are sentence fragments, do not end the items with any punctuation.
				</p><p>
					Example:
				</p><p>
					Kubernetes networking provides the following capabilities:
				</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
							Highly coupled container-to-container communications
						</p></li><li><p>
							Pod-to-pod communications
						</p></li><li><p>
							Pod-to-service communications
						</p></li><li><p>
							External-to-service communications
						</p></li></ul></div><p>
					Sometimes, list items might include some form of a verb, but if they do not also include a subject, then they are not capable of standing on their own. Such items count as sentence fragments, and are not ended with any punctuation.
				</p><p>
					Example:
				</p><p>
					Common uses for jobs include the following tasks:
				</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
							Initializing or migrating a database
						</p></li><li><p>
							Calculating one-off metrics from information within the cluster
						</p></li><li><p>
							Creating or restoring from a data backup
						</p></li></ul></div><p>
					Example:
				</p><p>
					Consider the following settings when creating a route:
				</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
							An optional path, for path-based routes
						</p></li><li><p>
							A target port that the application listens to
						</p></li><li><p>
							An encryption strategy, depending on whether you need a secure or an insecure route
						</p></li></ul></div><p>
					For a list where the items start with sentence fragments, and any of those fragments are followed by a complete sentence, end each of the fragments and sentences with a period.
				</p><p>
					Example:
				</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><ul><li><p>
							Identifier of the object schema version.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Schema identifier. In this example, the object conforms to the pod schema.
						</p></li><li><p>
							Name of the container inside a pod. Container names are important for <code>oc</code> commands when a pod contains multiple containers.
						</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div><p>
				Modifier strings (modifier + noun + noun sentence format) and over-modified nouns (or <em>noun stacks</em>) are especially difficult to translate, particularly when several different combinations might make sense. Avoid a stack of more than three consecutive nouns.

      ⁠</a>5.2. Grammatical Genders</h2></div></div></div><p>
			When using ambiguous pronouns such as &#34;they&#34; or &#34;it&#34;, it is not always clear what they refer to. For languages that have different genders for nouns, it is important to know exactly what each pronoun refers to. For example, the word &#34;it&#34; can be translated in several different ways and might require other grammatical adjustments.
		</p><p>
			Further, an initialism such as <span><em>RPM</em></span> might refer to the package or to the package manager. In German, <span><em>manager</em></span> is a masculine noun, and so RPM requires the masculine article &#34;der&#34; when it refers to the RPM Package Manager. <span><em>Package</em></span> is a neuter noun, and requires the neuter article &#34;das&#34; when it refers to an RPM package.

			</p></div></div></div><div><p>
			Avoid including commentary within the same box as command input or output. These comments might be confused with part of the output, and during translation might be accidentally overlooked and left in English.
		</p><p>
			For example, consider the word &#34;Usage&#34; in the following block:
		</p><pre>Usage: <code>rhevm-iso-uploader <em>[options]</em> list</code>
<code>rhevm-iso-uploader <em>[options] </em>upload <em>[file1] [file2] [file3]</em></code></pre></div><div><p>
			An entity is a primitive data type, which associates a string with either a unique alias (such as a user-specified name) or an SGML reserved word (such as #DEFAULT)<a id="id4585">
      ⁠</a><a xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook" href="#ftn.id4585"></a>. Entities are called by reference, and take the form &amp;name; (both the ampersand and the semicolon are required).
		</p><p>
			Entities can be helpful in some cases, but they are more of a hindrance when used for terms that need translation. Translators must compare the string with the built document to determine what the entity stands for. These entities might even be overlooked and not be translated at all.
		</p><p>
			To avoid issues with incorrect or outdated entity values, problems with translation, and so on, only include the entities that are required to build your books. If you use Publican (<a href="https://fedorahosted.org/publican/">https://fedorahosted.org/publican/</a>) to create and maintain your documentation, it creates and populates the required entities with default values when you create a publication.

      ⁠</a>Chapter 6. Using Cross-references Effectively</h2></div></div></div><p>
		This section contains suggestions on how to use cross-references in the most effective way: that is, so that they work for the reader rather than for the author.  Formatting is not described in this section.
	</p><p>
		In the days of print-only documentation, cross-references referred readers to additional or related information that existed elsewhere in the physical printed publication, on other pages. The readers had to physically turn pages to find the referenced page, so authors, editors, and proofreaders developed a certain caution about scattering cross-references through the text. Despite the ease of use and creation of cross-references and links in online documents today, the author must still do the work for the reader. The author must still do the heavy lifting and arrange the information so that the reader can absorb it in the smoothest possible fashion. Forcing the reader to leap from link to link might indicate that the author is writing for their own ease, and not for the good of the reader.
	</p><div><div><div><div><h2><a id="additional-information">
      ⁠</a>6.1. The Additional Information Test</h2></div></div></div><p>
			Is the cross-reference pointing to vital information or additional information?
		</p><p>
			A cross-reference should always point to additional information, not to core information that the reader needs to perform the task at hand. For example, in a procedure to configure an application, do not merely provide a link to the appendix where the correct naming conventions are described. Give the reader examples and explanations of a valid file name, and at the end of the procedure, provide a link to the appendix.
		</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2><a id="informationlink-ratio">
      ⁠</a>6.2. The Information/Link Ratio</h2></div></div></div><p>
			Does the paragraph or section consist largely of links?
		</p><p>
			In running text, each paragraph should contain no more than a couple of links. Links should not occur in every paragraph, and they must not occur in titles, subheadings, or figure captions. Cross-references interrupt the flow of thought, and can actively interfere with the absorption of information. If the reader needs much extra information, rethink the structure of the section, and enrich the quality of the information. Do not let the cross-references overpower the message. A solution is to add a sentence to the end of the section to indicate where to find more information.
		</p><div xmlns:d="http://docbook.org/ns/docbook"><div><p>
				Lists can be an exception, but try to provide the reader with a descriptive phrase or sentence for each cross-referenced item, as well as a lead-in and a concluding sentence for the paragraph that contains the list.
			</p></div></div></div><div><p>
			Repetition is a useful tool for reinforcing new knowledge and skills, emphasizing important ideas, and providing readers with important information at their point of need.
		</p><p>
			Repeating necessary information also saves the reader time and effort. In some circumstances, such as when using online help, the reader is trying to answer an immediate question or to solve a problem. In a safety situation, it is important for the reader to find critical information quickly.
		</p><p>
			If the information is vital, and must appear in multiple places, then it must be repeated. Any vital information, which is not more than a couple of paragraphs (or half a page, or five rows of a table), can be repeated rather than be cross-referenced to.

				</p></dd><dt><a id="io">
      ⁠</a><span>I/O</span></dt><dd><p>
					Correct. Stands for input/output (pronounced &#34;eye-oh&#34;). The term &#34;I/O&#34; is used to describe any program, operation, or device that transfers data to or from a computer and to or from a peripheral device. Every transfer is an output from one device and an input into another. Devices such as keyboards and mice are input-only devices; devices such as printers are output-only. A writable CD is both an input and an output device.
				</p><p>
					The term &#34;I/O&#34; is a non-countable noun. Append &#34;operations&#34; to refer to multiple units of I/O. For example: I/O operations could not be recovered in situations where I/O should have been temporarily queued, such as when paths were unavailable.

				</p></dd><dt><a id="ip-masquerade">
      ⁠</a><span>IP Masquerade</span></dt><dd><p>
					A Linux networking function. IP Masquerade, also called IPMASQ or MASQ, allows one or more computers in a network without assigned IP addresses to communicate with the internet by using the Linux server&#39;s assigned IP address. The IPMASQ server acts as a gateway, and the other devices are invisible behind it, so to other machines on the internet the outgoing traffic appears to be coming from the IPMASQ server and not from the internal PCs.
				</p><p>
					Because IPMASQ is a generic technology, the server can be connected to other computers through LAN technologies such as Ethernet, Token-Ring, and FDDI, as well as dial-up connections such as PPP or SLIP.

      ⁠</a><span>Itanium</span></dt><dd><p>
					A member of Intel&#39;s Merced family of processors, Itanium is a 64-bit RISC microprocessor. Based on the EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing) design philosophy, which states that the compiler should decide which instructions should be executed together, Itanium has the highest FPU power available.
				</p><p>
					In 64-bit mode, Itanium can calculate two bundles of a maximum of three instructions at a time. In 32-bit mode, it is much slower. Decoders must first translate 32-bit instruction sets into 64-bit instruction sets, which results in extra-clock cycle use.
				</p><p>
					Itanium&#39;s primary use is driving large applications that require more than 4 GB of memory, such as databases, ERP, and future internet applications.

					Abbreviation of &#34;logical partitioning&#34;, a system of taking a computer&#39;s total resources, such as processors, memory, and storage, and splitting them into smaller units that can be run with their own instance of the operating system and applications. Logical partitioning, which requires specialized hardware circuits, is typically used to separate different functions of a system, such as web serving, database functions, client/server actions, or systems that serve multiple time zones or languages. Logical partitioning can also keep testing environments separated from production environments. Because the partitions act as separate physical machines, they can communicate with each other. Logical partitioning was first used in 1976 by IBM.

					When referring to the designation of files, objects, or entities within documentation, use the term &#34;named&#34; instead of &#34;called&#34;. This choice promotes clarity and precision in technical content. The word &#34;named&#34; directly associates the name with the entity and is more specific in technical contexts. Use &#34;named&#34; to refer to such items as a file, directory, task, user, or group. For example, &#34;When you need to store configuration settings, create a directory named <code>configurations</code> to keep your workspace organized.&#34;

A server farm streamlines internal processes by distributing the workload between the individual components of the farm and expedites computing processes by harnessing the power of multiple servers. The farms rely on load-balancing software that accomplishes such tasks as tracking demand for processing power from different machines, prioritizing the tasks, and scheduling and rescheduling them depending on priority and demand that users put on the network. When one server in the farm fails, another can step in as a backup.
