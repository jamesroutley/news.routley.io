<p>Digital Mobile Radio (DMR) is a mobile radio standard created by ETSI, which is very popular within the amateur radio community. DMR radios are easily available on the market and the costs are low compared to D-Star or YSF radios, although the complexity of usage creates a barrier for entry. In addition, there is a very large community of listener-only amateurs who are interested in receiving digital transmissions using this mode.
