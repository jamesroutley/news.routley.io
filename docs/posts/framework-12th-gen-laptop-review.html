    <h1>Framework 12th gen laptop review</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">


          

            <p>The <a href="https://frame.work">Framework</a> is a 13.5&#34; laptop body with swappable parts, which
makes it somewhat future-proof and certainly easily repairable,
scoring an &#34;exceedingly rare&#34; <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/51614/framework-laptop-teardown-10-10-but-is-it-perfect">10/10 score from ifixit.com</a>.</p>

<p>There are two generations of the laptop&#39;s main board (both compatible
with the same body): the Intel 11th and 12th gen chipsets.</p>

<p>I have received my Framework, 12th generation &#34;DIY&#34;, device in late
September 2022 and will update this page as I go along in the process
of ordering, burning-in, setting up and using the device over the
years.</p>

<p>Overall, the Framework is a good laptop. I like the keyboard, the
touch pad, the expansion cards. Clearly there&#39;s been some good work
done on industrial design, and it&#39;s the most repairable laptop I&#39;ve
had in years. Time will tell, but it looks sturdy enough to survive me
many years as well.</p>

<p>This is also one of the most powerful devices I ever lay my hands
on. I have managed, remotely, more powerful servers, but this is the
fastest computer I have ever owned, and it fits in this tiny case. It
is an amazing machine.</p>

<p>On the downside, there&#39;s a bit of proprietary firmware required (WiFi,
Bluetooth, some graphics) and the Framework ships with a proprietary
BIOS, with currently <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32926736">no Coreboot support</a>. Expect to need the
latest kernel, firmware, and hacking around a bunch of things to get
resolution and keybindings working right.</p>

<p>Like others, I have first found significant power management issues,
but many issues can actually be solved with some configuration. Some
of the expansion ports (HDMI, DP, MicroSD, and SSD) use power when
idle, so don&#39;t expect week-long suspend, or &#34;full day&#34; battery while
those are plugged in.</p>

<p>Finally, the expansion ports are nice, but there&#39;s only four of
them. If you plan to have a two-monitor setup, you&#39;re likely going to
need a dock.</p>

<p>Read on for the detailed review. For context, I&#39;m moving from the
<a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/">Purism Librem 13v4</a> because it
<a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2022-08-25-one-dead-purism-laptop/">basically exploded on me</a>. I
had, in the meantime, reverted back to an old ThinkPad X220, so I
sometimes compare the Framework with that venerable laptop as well.</p>

<p>This blog post has been maturing for <em>months</em> now. It started in
September 2022 and I declared it completed in March 2023. It&#39;s the
longest single article on this entire website, currently clocking at
about 13,000 words. It will take an average reader a full hour to go
through this thing, so I don&#39;t expect anyone to actually <em>do</em>
that. This introduction should be good enough for most people, read
the first section if you intend to actually buy a Framework. Jump
around the table of contents as you see fit for after you did buy the
laptop, as it might include some crucial hints on how to make it work
best for you, especially on (Debian) Linux.</p>






<p>Those are things I wish I would have known before buying:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>consider buying 4 USB-C expansion cards, or at least a mix of 4
USB-A or USB-C cards, as they use less power than other cards and
you do want to fill those expansion slots otherwise they snag
around and feel insecure</p></li>
<li><p>you will likely need a dock or at least a USB hub if you want a
two-monitor setup, otherwise you&#39;ll run out of ports</p></li>
<li><p>you have to do some serious tuning to get proper (10h+ idle, 10
days suspend) power savings</p></li>
<li><p>in particular, beware that the HDMI, DisplayPort and
<em>particularly</em> the SSD and MicroSD cards take a significant amount
power, even when sleeping, up to 2-6W for the latter two</p></li>
<li><p>beware that the MicroSD card is what it says: Micro, normal SD
cards won&#39;t fit, and while there might be <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/i-found-an-sd-card-reader-that-fits/9910">full sized</a> one
eventually, it&#39;s currently only at the prototyping stage</p></li>
<li><p>the Framework monitor has an unusual aspect ratio (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_aspect_ratio#3:2">3:2</a>): I
like it (and it matches <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)#3:2">classic and digital photography aspect
ratio</a>), but it might surprise you</p></li>
</ol>




<p>I have the framework! It&#39;s setup with a fresh new Debian bookworm
installation. I&#39;ve ran through a large number of tests and burn in.</p>

<p>I have decided to use the Framework as my daily driver, and had to buy
a <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2023-02-10-usb-c/">USB-C dock</a> to get my two monitors
connected, which was own adventure.</p>



<p>Those are the specifications of the 12th gen, in general terms. Your

<p>This is basically the TL;DR: here, just focusing on broad pros/cons of
the laptop.</p>

<h2 id="pros"><a name="index6h2"></a>Pros</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>easily repairable (complete with QR codes pointing to <a href="https://guides.frame.work/c/Framework_Laptop">repair
guides</a>!), the 11th gen received a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/51614/framework-laptop-teardown-10-10-but-is-it-perfect">10/10 score from
ifixit.com</a>, which they call &#34;exceedingly rare&#34;, the 12th gen
has a similar hardware design and would probably rate similarly</p></li>
<li><p>replaceable motherboard!!! can be reused as a NUC-like device, with a
<a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/Mainboard">3d-printed case</a>, 12th gen board can be bought standalone and
retrofitted into an 11th gen case</p></li>
<li><p>not a passing fad: they made a first laptop with the 11th gen Intel
chipset in 2021, and a <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/introducing-the-new-and-upgraded-framework-laptop/18646">second motherboard</a> with the 12th Intel
chipset in 2022</p></li>
<li><p>four modular USB-C ports which can fit HDMI, USB-C (pass-through,
can provide power on both sides), USB-A, DisplayPort, MicroSD,
external storage (250GB, 1TB), <a href="https://community.frame.work/c/expansion-cards/developer-program/90">active modding community</a></p></li>
<li><p>nice power led indicating power level (charging, charged, etc) when
plugged</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://fwupd.org/lvfs/vendors/#framework">test account on fwupd.org</a>, &#34;expressed interest to port to

</ul>


<h2 id="cons"><a name="index7h2"></a>Cons</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>the 11th gen is out of stock, except for the higher-end CPUs, which
are much less affordable (700$+)</p></li>
<li><p>the 12th gen has compatibility issues with Debian, followup in the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/FrameWork/12thGen">DebianOn page</a>, but basically: <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-not-sending-xf86monbrightnessup-down/20605/6">brightness hotkeys</a>, <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-power-management-on-linux/21330">power

<li><p>compared to my previous laptop (<a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/">Purism Librem

bulkier and heavier; it&#39;s actually <em>lighter</em> than the purism (1.3kg
vs 1.4kg) and thinner (15.85mm vs 18mm) but the design of the

Update: they cracked that nut and ship an <a href="https://frame.work/ca/en/products/ethernet-expansion-card">2.5 gbps Ethernet

<li><p>12th gen Intel has glitchy graphics, seems like Intel hasn&#39;t fully
landed proper Linux support for that chipset yet</p></li>
</ul>




<p>A breeze.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-the-board"><a name="index8h2"></a>Accessing the board</h2>

<p>The internals are accessed through five TorX screws, but there&#39;s a nice
screwdriver/spudger that works well enough. The screws actually hold in
place so you can&#39;t even lose them.</p>

<p>The first setup is a bit counter-intuitive coming from the Librem
laptop, as I expected the back cover to lift and give me access to the
internals. But instead the screws is release the keyboard and touch
pad assembly, so you actually need to flip the laptop back upright and
<em>lift the assembly off</em> <img src="https://anarc.at/smileys/idea.png" alt="(!)"/> to get access to the internals. Kind of
scary.</p>

<p>I also actually unplugged a connector in lifting the assembly because
I lifted it towards the monitor, while you actually need to lift it
<em>to the right</em>. Thankfully, the connector didn&#39;t break, it just
snapped off and I could plug it back in, no harm done.</p>

<p>Once there, everything is well indicated, with QR codes all over the
place supposedly leading to online instructions.</p>

<h2 id="bad-qr-codes"><a name="index9h2"></a>Bad QR codes</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, the QR codes I tested (in the expansion card slot, the
memory slot and CPU slots) did not actually work so I wonder how
useful those actually are.</p>

<p>After all, they need to point to <em>something</em> and that means a URL, a
running website that will answer those requests forever. I bet those
will break sooner than later and in fact, as far as I can tell, they
just don&#39;t work at all. I prefer the approach taken by the MNT reform
here which designed (with the <a href="https://100r.co/">100 rabbits folks</a>) an <a href="https://shop.mntmn.com/products/mnt-reform-operator-handbook">actual paper
handbook</a> (<a href="https://mntre.com/media/reform_md/mnt-reform2-operator-handbook.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>

<p>The first QR code that&#39;s immediately visible from the back of the
laptop, in an expansion cord slot, is a 404. It <em>seems</em> to be some
serial number URL, but I can&#39;t actually tell because, well, the page
is a 404.</p>

<p>I was expecting that bar code to lead me to an introduction page,
something like &#34;how to setup your Framework laptop&#34;. Support actually
confirmed that it should point a <a href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Framework+Laptop+DIY+Edition+Quick+Start+Guide/57">quickstart guide</a>.  But in a
bizarre twist, they somehow sent me the URL with the plus (<code>+</code>) signs
escaped, like this:</p>

<pre><code>https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Framework\+Laptop\+DIY\+Edition\+Quick\+Start\+Guide/57
</code></pre>

<p>... which Firefox immediately transforms in:</p>

<pre><code>https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Framework/+Laptop/+DIY/+Edition/+Quick/+Start/+Guide/57
</code></pre>

<p>I&#39;m puzzled as to why they would send the URL that way, the proper URL
is of course:</p>

<pre><code>https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Framework+Laptop+DIY+Edition+Quick+Start+Guide/57
</code></pre>

<p>(They have also &#34;let the team know about this for feedback and help
resolve the problem with the link&#34; which is a support code word for
&#34;ha-ha!  nope! not my problem right now!&#34; Trust me, I know, my own
code word is &#34;can you please make a ticket?&#34;)</p>

<h2 id="seating-disks-and-memory"><a name="index10h2"></a>Seating disks and memory</h2>

<p>The &#34;DIY&#34; kit doesn&#39;t actually have that much of a setup. If you
bought RAM, it&#39;s shipped outside the laptop in a little plastic case,
so you just seat it in as usual.</p>

<p>Then you insert your NVMe drive, and, if that&#39;s your fancy, you also
install your own mPCI WiFi card. If you ordered one (which was my
case), it&#39;s pre-installed.</p>

<p>Closing the laptop is also kind of amazing, because the keyboard
assembly snaps into place with magnets. I have actually used the
laptop with the keyboard unscrewed as I was putting the drives in and
out, and it actually works fine (and will probably void your warranty,
so don&#39;t do that). (But you can.) (But don&#39;t, really.)</p>



<h2 id="keyboard-and-touch-pad"><a name="index11h2"></a>Keyboard and touch pad</h2>

<p>The keyboard feels nice, for a laptop. I&#39;m used to mechanical keyboard
and I&#39;m rather violent with those poor things. Yet the key travel is
nice and it&#39;s clickety enough that I don&#39;t feel too disoriented.</p>

<p>At first, I felt the keyboard as being more laggy than my normal
workstation setup, but it turned out this was a graphics driver
issues. After enabling a composition manager, everything feels snappy.</p>

<p>The touch pad feels good. The double-finger scroll works well enough,
and I don&#39;t have to wonder too much where the middle button is, it
just works.</p>

<p>Taps don&#39;t work, out of the box: that needs to be enabled in Xorg,
with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>cat &gt; /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf &lt;&lt;EOF
Section &#34;InputClass&#34;
      Identifier &#34;libinput touch pad catchall&#34;
      MatchIsTouchpad &#34;on&#34;
      MatchDevicePath &#34;/dev/input/event*&#34;
      Driver &#34;libinput&#34;
      Option &#34;Tapping&#34; &#34;on&#34;
      Option &#34;TappingButtonMap&#34; &#34;lmr&#34;
EndSection
EOF
</code></pre>

<p>But be aware that once you enable that tapping, you&#39;ll need to deal
with palm detection... So I have not actually enabled this in the end.</p>

<h3 id="power-button"><a name="index1h3"></a>Power button</h3>

<p>The power button is a <em>little</em> dangerous. It&#39;s quite easy to hit, as
it&#39;s right next to one expansion card where you are likely to plug in
a cable power. And because the expansion cards are kind of hard to
remove, you might squeeze the laptop (and the power key) when trying
to remove the expansion card next to the power button.</p>

<p>So obviously, don&#39;t do that. But that&#39;s not very helpful.</p>

<p>An alternative is to make the power button do something else. With
systemd-managed systems, it&#39;s actually quite easy. Add a
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/logind.conf.html#HandlePowerKey=">HandlePowerKey</a> stanza to (say)
<code>/etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/power-suspends.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[Login]
HandlePowerKey=suspend
HandlePowerKeyLongPress=poweroff
</code></pre>

<p>You might have to create the directory first:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir /etc/systemd/logind.conf.d/
</code></pre>

<p>Then restart logind:</p>

<pre><code>systemctl restart systemd-logind
</code></pre>

<p>And the power button will suspend! Long-press to power off doesn&#39;t
actually work as the laptop <em>immediately</em> suspends...</p>

<p>Note that there&#39;s probably half a dozen <em>other</em> ways of doing this,
see <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/699905/change-behavior-of-linux-power-button">this</a>, <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/242129/how-to-set-power-button-to-shutdown-instead-of-suspend">this</a>, or <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/66723/how-do-i-modify-the-options-for-the-power-button">that</a>.</p>

<h3 id="special-keybindings"><a name="index2h3"></a>Special keybindings</h3>

<p>There is a series of &#34;hidden&#34; (as in: not labeled on the key)
keybindings related to the <kbd>fn</kbd> keybinding that I actually
find quite useful.</p>

<p>It looks like those are <a href="https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/EmbeddedController/blob/03897d4070b3accdb216d2e72e40134a6b5958e0/board/hx20/keyboard_customization.c#L370-L408">defined in the microcontroller</a> so it
would be possible to add some. For example, the <kbd>SysRq</kbd> key
is <em>almost</em> bound to <kbd>fn</kbd> <kbd>s</kbd> in there.</p>

<p>Note that most other shortcuts like this are clearly documented
(volume, brightness, etc). One key that&#39;s less obvious is
<kbd>F12</kbd> that only has the Framework logo on it. That actually
calls the keysym <code>XF86AudioMedia</code> which, interestingly, does
absolutely nothing here. By default, on Windows, it <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/what-does-the-framework-button-on-my-keyboard-do-Sk3XlBpw9">opens your
browser to the Framework website</a> and, on Linux, your &#34;default
media player&#34;.</p>

<p>The keyboard backlight can be cycled with <kbd>fn-space</kbd>. The
dimmer version is dim enough, and the keybinding is easy to find in
the dark.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key">skinny elephant</a> would be performed with <kbd>alt</kbd>
<kbd>PrtScr</kbd> (above <kbd>F11</kbd>) <kbd>KEY</kbd>, so for
example <kbd>alt</kbd> <kbd>fn</kbd> <kbd>F11</kbd> <kbd>b</kbd>
should do a hard reset. <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/how-to-use-the-sysrq-key/10155/9">This comment</a> suggests you need to hold
the <kbd>fn</kbd> <em>only</em> if &#34;function lock&#34; is <em>on</em>, but that&#39;s
actually the opposite of my experience.</p>

<p>Out of the box, some of the <kbd>fn</kbd> keys don&#39;t work. Mute,
volume up/down, brightness, monitor changes, and the airplane mode key
all do basically nothing. They don&#39;t send proper keysyms to Xorg at
all.</p>

<p>This is a <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-not-sending-xf86monbrightnessup-down/20605">known problem</a> and it&#39;s related to the fact that the
laptop has light sensors to adjust the brightness
automatically. Somehow some of those keys (e.g. the brightness
controls) are supposed to show up as a different input device, but
don&#39;t seem to work correctly. It seems like the solution is for the
Framework team to write a driver specifically for this, but <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-not-sending-xf86monbrightnessup-down/20605/34?u=anarcat">so far no
progress since July 2022</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the fancy functionality can be supposedly disabled with:</p>

<pre><code>echo &#39;blacklist hid_sensor_hub&#39; | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/framework-als-blacklist.conf
</code></pre>

<p>... and a reboot. This solution is also <a href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Fedora+36+Installation+on+the+Framework+Laptop/108?lang=en#s734">documented in the upstream
guide</a>.</p>

<p>Note that there&#39;s another solution flying around that fixes this by
<a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-not-sending-xf86monbrightnessup-down/20605/24?u=anarcat">changing permissions on the input device</a> but I haven&#39;t tested
that or seen confirmation it works.</p>

<h3 id="kill-switches"><a name="index3h3"></a>Kill switches</h3>

<p>The Framework has two &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_switch">kill switches</a>&#34;: one for the camera and the
other for the microphone. The camera one actually disconnects the USB
device when turned off, and the mic one seems to cut the circuit. It
doesn&#39;t show up as muted, it just stops feeding the sound.</p>

<p>Both kill switches are around the main camera, on top of the monitor,
and quite discreet. Then turn &#34;red&#34; when enabled (i.e. &#34;red&#34; means
&#34;turned off&#34;).</p>

<h2 id="monitor"><a name="index12h2"></a>Monitor</h2>

<p>The monitor looks pretty good to my untrained eyes. I have yet to do
photography work on it, but some photos I looked at look sharp and the
colors are bright and lively. The blacks are dark and the screen is
bright.</p>

<p>I have yet to use it in full sunlight.</p>

<p>The dimmed light is very dim, which I like.</p>

<h3 id="screen-backlight"><a name="index4h3"></a>Screen backlight</h3>

<p>I bind brightness keys to <code>xbacklight</code> in i3, but out of the box I get
this error:</p>

<pre><code>sep 29 22:09:14 angela i3[5661]: No outputs have backlight property
</code></pre>

<p>It just requires this blob in <code>/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/backlight.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Section &#34;Device&#34;
    Identifier  &#34;Card0&#34;
    Driver      &#34;intel&#34;
    Option      &#34;Backlight&#34;  &#34;intel_backlight&#34;
EndSection
</code></pre>

<p>This way I can control the actual backlight power with the brightness
keys, and they do significantly reduce power usage.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-monitor-support"><a name="index5h3"></a>Multiple monitor support</h3>

<p>I have been able to hook up my two old monitors to the HDMI and
DisplayPort expansion cards on the laptop. The lid closes without
suspending the machine, and everything works great.</p>

<p>I actually run out of ports, even with a 4-port USB-A hub, which gives
me a total of 7 ports:</p>

<ol>
<li>power (USB-C)</li>
<li>monitor 1 (DisplayPort)</li>
<li>monitor 2 (HDMI)</li>
<li>USB-A hub, which adds:</li>
<li>keyboard (USB-A)</li>
<li>mouse (USB-A)</li>
<li>Yubikey</li>
<li>external sound card</li>
</ol>


<p>Now the latter, I might be able to get rid of if I switch to a
combo-jack headset, which I do have (and still need to test).</p>

<p>But still, this is a problem. I&#39;ll probably need a powered USB-C dock
and better monitors, possibly with some <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/whats-the-downside/22999/21?u=anarcat">Thunderbolt chaining</a>, to
save yet more ports.</p>

<p>But that means more money into this setup, argh. And figuring out my
<a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/monitor/">monitor</a> situation is the kind of thing I&#39;m not that big
of a fan of. And neither is shopping for USB-C (or is it Thunderbolt?)
hubs.</p>

<p>My normal <code>autorandr</code> setup doesn&#39;t work: I have tried saving a
profile and it doesn&#39;t get autodetected, so I also first need to do:</p>

<pre><code>autorandr -l framework-external-dual-lg-acer
</code></pre>

<p>The magic:</p>

<pre><code>autorandr -l horizontal
</code></pre>

<p>... also works well.</p>

<p>The worst problem with those monitors right now is that they have a
radically smaller resolution than the main screen on the laptop, which
means I need to reset the font scaling to normal every time I switch
back and forth between those monitors and the laptop, which means I
actually need to do this:</p>

<pre><code>autorandr -l horizontal &amp;&amp;
eho Xft.dpi: 96 | xrdb -merge &amp;&amp;
systemctl restart terminal xcolortaillog background-image emacs &amp;&amp;
i3-msg restart
</code></pre>

<p>Kind of disruptive.</p>

<h2 id="expansion-ports"><a name="index13h2"></a>Expansion ports</h2>

<p>I ordered a total of 10 expansion ports.</p>

<p>I did manage to initialize the 1TB drive as an encrypted storage,
mostly to keep photos as this is something that takes a massive amount
of space (500GB and counting) and that I (unfortunately) don&#39;t work on
very often (but still carry around).</p>

<p>The expansion ports are fancy and nice, but not actually that
convenient. They&#39;re a bit hard to take out: you really need to crimp
your fingernails on there and pull hard to take them out. There&#39;s a
little button next to them to release, I think, but at first it feels
a little scary to pull those pucks out of there. You get used to it
though, and it&#39;s one of those things you can do without looking
eventually.</p>

<p>There&#39;s <em>only</em> four expansion ports. Once you have two monitors, the
drive, and power plugged in, bam, you&#39;re out of ports; there&#39;s nowhere
to plug my Yubikey. So if this is going to be my daily driver, with a
dual monitor setup, I will need a dock, which means more crap firmware
and uncertainty, which isn&#39;t great. There are actually plans to make a
dual-USB card, but that is <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/why-no-dual-usb-c-card/2145/3?u=anarcat">blocked</a> on <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/what-new-expansion-card-types-do-you-want-to-see-released/193/3">designing an actual
board</a> for this.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t wait to see more expansion ports produced. There&#39;s a <a href="https://frame.work/ca/en/products/ethernet-expansion-card">ethernet
expansion card</a> which quickly went out of stock basically the day
it was announced, but was eventually restocked.</p>

<p>I would like to see a proper SD-card reader. There&#39;s a <em>MicroSD</em> card
reader, but that obviously doesn&#39;t work for normal SD cards, which
would be more broadly compatible anyways (because you can have a
MicroSD to SD card adapter, but I have never heard of the
reverse). Someone actually <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/i-found-an-sd-card-reader-that-fits/9910">found a SD card reader that fits</a> and
then <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/i-found-an-sd-card-reader-that-fits/9910/18?u=anarcat">someone else managed to cram it in a 3D printed case</a>, which
is kind of amazing.</p>

<p>Still, I really like that idea that I can carry all those little
adapters in a pouch when I travel and can basically do anything I
want. It does mean I need to shuffle through them to find the right
one which is a little annoying. I have an elastic band to keep them
lined up so that all the ports show the same side, to make it easier
to find the right one. But that quickly gets undone and instead I have
a pouch full of expansion cards.</p>

<p>Another awesome thing with the expansion cards is that they don&#39;t just
work on the laptop: anything that takes USB-C can take those cards,
which means you can use it to connect an SD card to your phone, for
backups, for example. Heck, you could even connect an external display
to your phone that way, assuming that&#39;s supported by your phone of
course (and it probably isn&#39;t).</p>

<p>The expansion ports <em>do</em> take up some power, even when idle. See the
<a href="#power-management">power management</a> section below, and particularly the <a href="#detailed-power-usage-tests">power usage
tests</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="usb-c-charging"><a name="index14h2"></a>USB-C charging</h2>

<p>One thing that is really a game changer for me is USB-C charging. It&#39;s
hard to overstate how convenient this is. I often have a USB-C cable
lying around to charge my phone, and I can just grab that thing and
pop it in my laptop. And while it will obviously not charge as fast as
the provided charger, it will stop draining the battery at least.</p>

<p>(As I wrote this, I had the laptop plugged in the Samsung charger that
came with a phone, and it was telling me it would take 6 hours to
charge the remaining 15%. With the provided charger, that flew down to
<em>15 minutes</em>. Similarly, I can power the laptop from the power grommet
on my desk, reducing clutter as I have that single wire out there
instead of the bulky power adapter.)</p>

<p>I also really like the idea that I can charge my laptop with a power
bank or, heck, with my <em>phone</em>, if push comes to shove. (And
vice-versa!)</p>

<p>This is awesome. And it works from <em>any</em> of the expansion ports, of
course. There&#39;s a little led next to the expansion ports as well,
which indicate the charge status:</p>

<ul>
<li>red/amber: charging</li>
<li>white: charged</li>
<li>off: unplugged</li>
</ul>


<p>I <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/what-do-the-charging-led-colors-mean/23408">couldn&#39;t find documentation about this</a>, but <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/what-do-the-charging-led-colors-mean/23408/2?u=anarcat">the forum
answered</a>.</p>

<p>This is something of a recurring theme with the Framework. While it
has a good <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/">knowledge base</a> and <a href="https://guides.frame.work/">repair/setup guides</a> (and the
<a href="https://community.frame.work/">forum is awesome</a>) but it doesn&#39;t have a good &#34;owner manual&#34; that
shows you the different parts of the laptop and what they do. Again,
something the <a href="https://shop.mntmn.com/products/mnt-reform-operator-handbook">MNT reform did well</a>.</p>

<p>Another thing that people are asking about is an <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/externally-visible-sleep-indicator/5615">external sleep
indicator</a>: because the power LED is on the main keyboard assembly,
you don&#39;t actually see whether the device is active or not when the
lid is closed.</p>

<p>Finally, I wondered <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/plugging-in-multiple-power-sources-does-the-right-thing/26215">what happens when you plug in multiple power
sources</a> and it turns out the charge controller is actually pretty
smart: it will pick the best power source and use it. The only
downside is it can&#39;t use <em>multiple</em> power sources, but that seems like
a bit much to ask.</p>



<p>Those things also work:</p>

<ul>
<li>webcam: splendid, best webcam I&#39;ve ever had (but my standards are
really low)</li>
<li>onboard mic: works well, good gain (maybe a bit much)</li>
<li>onboard speakers: sound okay, a little metal-ish, loud enough to be
annoying, see <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/speakers-sound-quality/1078">this thread for benchmarks</a>, apparently pretty
good speakers</li>
<li>combo jack: <em>works</em>, with slight hiss, see below</li>
</ul>


<p>There&#39;s also a light sensor, but it conflicts with the keyboard
brightness controls (see above).</p>

<p>There&#39;s also an <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/why-is-there-an-accelerometer/3685">accelerometer</a>, but it&#39;s <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/why-is-there-an-accelerometer/3685/5?u=anarcat">off by default</a> and
will be <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/why-is-there-an-accelerometer/3685/14?u=anarcat">removed from future builds</a>.</p>

<h3 id="combo-jack-mic-tests"><a name="index6h3"></a>Combo jack mic tests</h3>

<p>The Framework laptop ships with a combo jack on the left side, which
allows you to plug in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_connector_(audio)#TRRS_standards">CTIA</a> (<a href="https://community.frame.work/t/headphone-jack-otmp-or-ctia/23553/4?u=anarcat">source</a>) headset. In human
terms, it&#39;s a device that has both a stereo output and a mono input,
typically a headset or ear buds with a microphone somewhere.</p>

<p>It <em>works</em>, which is better than the Purism (which only had audio
out), but is on par for the course for that kind of onboard
hardware. Because of electrical interference, such sound cards very
often get lots of noise from the board.</p>

<p>With a Jabra Evolve 40, the built-in USB sound card generates
basically zero noise on silence (invisible down to -60dB in Audacity)
while plugging it in directly generates a solid -30dB hiss. There <em>is</em>
a noise-reduction system in that sound card, but the difference is
still quite striking.</p>

<p>On a comparable setup (<a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/curie/">curie</a>, a 2017 Intel NUC), there is
also a his with the Jabra headset, but it&#39;s quieter, more in the order
of -40/-50 dB, a noticeable difference. Interestingly, testing with my
Mee Audio Pro M6 earbuds leads to a little more hiss on curie, more on
the -35/-40 dB range, close to the Framework.</p>

<p>Also note that another sound card, the Antlion USB adapter that comes
with the ModMic 4, also gives me pretty close to silence on a quiet
recording, picking up less than -50dB of background noise. It&#39;s
actually probably picking up the fans in the office, which do make
audible noises.</p>

<p>In other words, the hiss of the sound card built in the Framework
laptop is so loud that it makes more noise than the quiet fans in the
office. Or, another way to put it is that two USB sound cards (the
Jabra and the Antlion) are able to pick up ambient noise in my office
but not the Framework laptop.</p>

<p>This was using 16 watts of power, with full screen brightness.</p>

<p>With all 16 cores (<code>make -j16</code>), it takes less than 25 minutes:</p>

battery would actually run out using my desk&#39;s power grommet (34
watts).</p>

<p>During compilation, fans were spinning really hard, quite noisy, but
not painfully so.</p>

<p>So about 30 minutes for a full 16GB memory test.</p>



<p>Once I had everything in the hardware setup, I figured, voilà, I&#39;m
done, I&#39;m just going to boot this beautiful machine and I can get back
to work.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand why I am so naïve some times. It&#39;s mind boggling.</p>

<p>Obviously, it didn&#39;t happen that way at all, and I spent the best of
the three following days tinkering with the laptop.</p>

<h2 id="secure-boot-and-efi"><a name="index17h2"></a>Secure boot and EFI</h2>

<p>First, I couldn&#39;t boot off of the NVMe drive I transferred from the
previous laptop (the <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/purism-librem13v4/">Purism</a>) and the
BIOS was not very helpful: it was just complaining about not finding
any boot device, without dropping me in the real BIOS.</p>

<p>At first, I thought it was a problem with my NVMe drive, because it&#39;s
not listed in the <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/what-storage-ssd-parts-are-compatible-with-the-framework-laptop-rJOOeHU0_">compatible SSD drives</a> from upstream. But I
figured out <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/how-do-i-enter-the-bios-on-the-framework-laptop-HydmWf5Ad">how to enter BIOS</a> (press <kbd>F2</kbd> manically, of
course), which showed the NVMe drive was actually detected. It just
didn&#39;t boot, because it was an old (2010!!) Debian install without
EFI.</p>

<p>So from there, I disabled secure boot, and booted a <a href="https://grml.org/">grml image</a> to
try to recover. And by &#34;boot&#34; I mean, I managed to get to the grml
boot loader which promptly failed to load its own root file system
somehow. I still have to investigate exactly what happened there, but
it failed some time after the initrd load with:</p>

<pre><code>Unable to find medium containing a live file system
</code></pre>

<p>This, it turns out, was fixed in Debian lately, so a <a href="https://daily.grml.org/">daily GRML
build</a> will not have this problems. The upcoming 2022 release
(likely 2022.10 or 2022.11) will also get the fix.</p>

<p>I did manage to boot the <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">development version of the Debian
installer</a> which was a surprisingly good experience: it mounted the
encrypted drives and did everything pretty smoothly. It even offered
me to reinstall the boot loader, but that ultimately (and correctly, as
it turns out) failed because I didn&#39;t have a <code>/boot/efi</code> partition.</p>

<p>At this point, I realized there was no easy way out of this, and I
just proceeded to completely reinstall Debian. I had a spare NVMe
drive lying around (backups FTW!) so I just swapped that in, rebooted
in the Debian installer, and did a clean install. I wanted to switch
to bookworm anyways, so I guess that&#39;s done too.</p>

<h2 id="storage-limitations"><a name="index18h2"></a>Storage limitations</h2>

<p>Another thing that happened during setup is that I tried to copy over
the internal 2.5&#34; SSD drive from the Purism to the Framework 1TB
expansion card. There&#39;s no 2.5&#34; slot in the new laptop, so that&#39;s
pretty much the only option for storage expansion.</p>

<p>I was tired and did something wrong. I ended up wiping the partition
table on the <em>original</em> 2.5&#34; drive.</p>

<p>Oops.</p>

<p>It <em>might</em> be recoverable, but just restoring the partition table
didn&#39;t work either, so I&#39;m not sure how I recover the data
there. Normally, everything on my laptops and workstations is designed
to be disposable, so that wasn&#39;t that big of a problem. I did manage
to recover most of the data thanks to <a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/">git-annex</a> <a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/git-annex-reinit/">reinit</a>, but
that was a little hairy.</p>

<h2 id="bootstrapping-puppet"><a name="index19h2"></a>Bootstrapping Puppet</h2>

<p>Once I had some networking, I had to install all the packages I
needed. The time I spent setting up my workstations with Puppet has
finally paid off. What I actually did was to restore two critical
directories:</p>

<pre><code>/etc/ssh
/var/lib/puppet

<p>So that I would keep the previous machine&#39;s identity. That way I could
contact the Puppet server and install whatever was missing. I used my
<a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2022-09-29-optimizing-puppet-bootstrap/">Puppet optimization
trick</a> to do a batch
install and then I had a good base setup, although not exactly as it
was before. 1700 packages were installed manually on <code>angela</code> before
the reinstall, and not in Puppet.</p>

<p>I did not inspect each one individually, but I did go through <code>/etc</code>
and copied over more SSH keys, for backups and <a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/rsendmail">SMTP over SSH</a>.</p>

<h2 id="lvfs-support"><a name="index20h2"></a>LVFS support</h2>

<p>It looks like there&#39;s support for the (de-facto) standard LVFS
firmware update system. At least I was able to update the UEFI
firmware with a simple:</p>

<pre><code>apt install fwupd-amd64-signed
fwupdmgr refresh
fwupdmgr get-updates
fwupdmgr update
</code></pre>

<p>Nice. The 12th gen <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/framework-laptop-bios-and-driver-releases-12th-gen-intel-core-Bkx2kosqq">BIOS updates</a>, currently (January 2023) beta,
can be deployed through LVFS with:</p>

<pre><code>fwupdmgr enable-remote lvfs-testing
echo &#39;DisableCapsuleUpdateOnDisk=true&#39; &gt;&gt; /etc/fwupd/uefi_capsule.conf 
fwupdmgr update
</code></pre>

<p>Those instructions come from the <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-intel-core-bios-3-06-beta/25726">beta forum post</a>. I performed the
BIOS update on 2023-01-16T16:00-0500.</p>

<h2 id="resolution-tweaks"><a name="index21h2"></a>Resolution tweaks</h2>

<p>The Framework laptop resolution (2256px X 1504px) is big enough to
give you a pretty small font size, so welcome to the marvelous world
of &#34;scaling&#34;.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/FrameWork/12thGen">Debian wiki page</a> has a few tricks for this.</p>

<h3 id="console"><a name="index9h3"></a>Console</h3>

<p>This will make the console and grub fonts more readable:</p>

<pre><code>cat &gt;&gt; /etc/default/console-setup &lt;&lt;EOF
FONTFACE=&#34;Terminus&#34;
FONTSIZE=32x16
EOF
echo GRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768 &gt;&gt; /etc/default/grub
update-grub
</code></pre>

<h3 id="xorg"><a name="index10h3"></a>Xorg</h3>

<p>Adding this to your <code>.Xresources</code> will make everything look much bigger:</p>

<pre><code>! 1.5*96
Xft.dpi: 144
</code></pre>

<p>Apparently, some of this can also help:</p>

<pre><code>! These might also be useful depending on your monitor and personal preference:
Xft.autohint: 0
Xft.lcdfilter:  lcddefault
Xft.hintstyle:  hintfull
Xft.hinting: 1
Xft.antialias: 1
Xft.rgba: rgb
</code></pre>

<p>It my experience it also makes things look a little fuzzier, which is
frustrating because you have this awesome monitor but everything looks
out of focus. Just bumping <code>Xft.dpi</code> by a 1.5 factor looks good to me.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/HiDPI">Debian Wiki has a page on HiDPI</a>, but it&#39;s not as good as the
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI">Arch Wiki</a>, where the above blurb comes from. I am not using the
latter because I suspect it&#39;s causing some of the &#34;fuzziness&#34;.</p>

<h2 id="bios-configuration"><a name="index22h2"></a>BIOS configuration</h2>

<p>The Framework BIOS has some minor issues. One issue I personally
encountered is that I had disabled <code>Quick boot</code> and <code>Quiet boot</code> in
the BIOS to diagnose the above boot issues. This, in turn, triggers a
bug where the BIOS boot manager (<kbd>F12</kbd>) would just hang
completely. It would also fail to boot from an external USB drive.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/how-do-i-enter-the-bios-on-the-framework-laptop-HydmWf5Ad">current fix</a> (as of BIOS 3.03) is to re-enable both <code>Quick
boot</code> and <code>Quiet boot</code>. Presumably this is something that will get
fixed in a future BIOS update.</p>

<p>Note that the following keybindings are active in the BIOS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test">POST

<h2 id="wifi-compatibility-issues"><a name="index23h2"></a>WiFi compatibility issues</h2>

<p>I couldn&#39;t make WiFi work at first. Obviously, the default Debian
installer doesn&#39;t ship with proprietary firmware (although that <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/908825/">might
change soon</a>) so the WiFi card didn&#39;t work out of the box. But even
after copying the firmware through a USB stick, I couldn&#39;t quite
manage to find the right combination of <code>ip</code>/<code>iw</code>/<code>wpa-supplicant</code>
(yes, after repeatedly copying a bunch <em>more</em> packages over to get
those bootstrapped). (Next time I should probably try something like
<a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/283722/how-to-connect-to-wifi-from-command-line">this post</a>.)</p>

<p>Thankfully, I had a little USB-C dongle with a RJ-45 jack lying
around. That <em>also</em> required a firmware blob, but it was a single
package to copy over, and with that loaded, I had network.</p>

<p>Eventually, I did managed to make WiFi work; the problem was more on
the side of &#34;I forgot how to configure a WPA network by hand from the
commandline&#34; than anything else. NetworkManager worked fine and got
WiFi working correctly.</p>

<p>Note that this is with Debian bookworm, which has the 5.19 Linux
kernel, and with the <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/firmware-nonfree">firmware-nonfree</a> (<code>firmware-iwlwifi</code>,
specifically) package.</p>

<h2 id="battery-life"><a name="index24h2"></a>Battery life</h2>

<p>I was having between about 7 hours of battery on the Purism Librem
13v4, and that&#39;s after a year or two of battery life. Now, I <em>still</em>
have about 7 hours of battery life, which is nicer than my old
ThinkPad X220 (20 minutes!) but really, it&#39;s not <em>that</em> good for a new
generation laptop. The 12th generation Intel chipset probably improved
things compared to the previous one Framework laptop, but I don&#39;t have
a 11th gen Framework to compare with).</p>

<p>(Note that those are estimates from my status bar, not wall clock
measurements. They should still be comparable between the Purism and
Framework, that said.)</p>

<p>The battery life doesn&#39;t seem up to, say, Dell XPS 13, ThinkPad X1, and
of course not the Apple M1, where I would expect 10+ hours of battery
life out of the box.</p>

<p>That said, I do get those kind estimates when the machine is fully
charged and idle. In fact, when everything is quiet and nothing is
plugged in, I get <em>dozens</em> of hours of battery life estimated (I&#39;ve
seen 25h!). So power usage fluctuates quite a bit depending on usage,
which I guess is expected.</p>

<p>Concretely, so far, light web browsing, reading emails and writing
notes in Emacs (e.g. this file) takes about 8W of power:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Expansion cards matter a lot in the battery life (see below for a
thorough discussion), my normal setup is 2xUSB-C and 1xUSB-A (yes,
with an empty slot, and yes, to save power).</p>

<p>Interestingly, playing a video in a (720p) window in a window takes up
more power (10.5W) than in full screen (9.5W) but I blame that on my
desktop setup (i3 + compton)... Not sure if <code>mpv</code> hits the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Acceleration_API">VA-API</a>, maybe not in windowed mode. Similar results with 1080p,
interestingly, except the window struggles to keep up altogether. Full
screen playback takes a relatively comfortable 9.5W, which means a
solid 5h+ of playback, which is fine by me.</p>

<p>Fooling around the web, small edits, <code>youtube-dl</code>, and I&#39;m at around 80%
battery after about an hour, with an estimated 5h left, which is a
little disappointing. I had a 7h remaining estimate before I started
goofing around <a href="https://community.frame.work/">Discourse</a>, so I suspect the website is a pretty
big battery drain, actually. I see about 10-12 W, while I was probably at
half that (6-8W) just playing music with <code>mpv</code> in the background...</p>

<p>In other words, it looks like editing posts in Discourse with Firefox
takes a solid 4-6W of power. Amazing and gross.</p>

<p>(When writing about abusive power usage generates more power usage, is
that an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug">heisenbug</a>? Or <em>schrödinbug</em>?)</p>

<h2 id="power-management"><a name="index25h2"></a>Power management</h2>

<p>Compared to the Purism Librem 13v4, the <em>ongoing</em> power usage seems to
be slightly better. An anecdotal metric is that the Purism would take
800mA idle, while the more powerful Framework manages a little over
500mA as I&#39;m typing this, fluctuating between 450 and 600mA. That is
without any active expansion card, except the storage. Those numbers
come from the output of <code>tlp-stat -b</code> and, unfortunately, the &#34;ampere&#34;
unit makes it quite hard to compare those, because voltage is not
necessarily the same between the two platforms.</p>

<ul>
<li>TODO: review <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management#Power_saving">Arch Linux&#39;s tips</a> on power saving</li>
<li>TODO: i915 driver has a lot of parameters, including some about
power saving, see, again, the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/intel_graphics#Module-based_options">arch wiki</a>, and particularly
<code>enable_fbc=1</code></li>
</ul>


<p>TL:DR; power management on the laptop is an issue, but there&#39;s various
tweaks you can make to improve it. Try:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>powertop --auto-tune</code></li>
<li><code>apt install tlp &amp;&amp; systemctl enable tlp</code></li>
<li><code>nvme.noacpi=1 mem_sleep_default=deep</code> on the kernel command line
may help with standby power usage</li>
<li>keep only USB-C expansion cards plugged in, all others suck power
even when idle</li>
<li>consider upgrading the BIOS to latest beta (3.06 at the time of
writing), unverified power savings</li>
<li>latest Linux kernels (6.2) promise power savings as well
(unverified)</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="background-on-cpu-architecture"><a name="index11h3"></a>Background on CPU architecture</h3>

<p>There were power problems in the 11th gen Framework laptop, according
to <a href="https://linuxafterdark.net/linux-after-dark-episode-14/">this report from Linux After Dark</a>, so the issues with power
management on the Framework are not new.</p>

<p>The 12th generation Intel CPU (AKA &#34;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Lake">Alder Lake</a>&#34;) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterogeneous_computing">big-little
architecture</a> with &#34;power-saving&#34; and &#34;performance&#34; cores. There
used to be <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/01/linux_5_16_alder_lake/">performance problems introduced by the scheduler in Linux
5.16</a> but those were eventually <a href="https://linux.slashdot.org/story/22/02/12/2237234/intel-thread-director-is-headed-to-linux-for-a-major-boost-in-alder-lake-performance">fixed in 5.18</a>, which uses
Intel&#39;s hardware as an &#34;intelligent, low-latency hardware-assisted
scheduler&#34;. According <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-519-alderlakep">to Phoronix</a>, the 5.19 release improved the
power saving, at the cost of some penalty cost. There were also <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Cluster-Scheduling-Configure">patch
series</a> to make the scheduler configurable, but it doesn&#39;t look
those have been merged as of 5.19. There was also a session about this
at the <a href="https://lpc.events/">2022 Linux Plumbers</a>, but they <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/909611/">stopped short</a> of
talking more about the specific problems Linux is facing in Alder
lake:</p>

<blockquote><p>Specifically, the kernel&#39;s energy-aware scheduling heuristics don&#39;t
work well on those CPUs. A number of features present there
complicate the energy picture; these include SMT, Intel&#39;s &#34;turbo
boost&#34; mode, and the CPU&#39;s internal power-management mechanisms. For
many workloads, running on an ostensibly more power-hungry Pcore can
be more efficient than using an Ecore. Time for discussion of the
problem was lacking, though, and the session came to a close.</p></blockquote>

<p>All this to say that the 12gen Intel line shipped with this Framework
series <em>should</em> have better power management thanks to its
power-saving cores. And Linux has had the scheduler changes to make
use of this (but maybe is still having trouble). In any case, this
might not be the source of power management problems on my laptop,
quite the opposite.</p>

<p>Also note that the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31434021">firmware updates for various chipsets</a> are
supposed to improve things eventually.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/">The Verge</a> simply declared the whole <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23496706/intel-p-series-processor-cpu-laptop-battery-life">P-series
a mistake</a>...</p>

<h3 id="attempts-at-improving-power-usage"><a name="index12h3"></a>Attempts at improving power usage</h3>

<p>I did try to follow some of the tips in <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/linux-battery-life-tuning/6665">this forum post</a>. The
tricks <code>powertop --auto-tune</code> and <code>tlp</code>&#39;s
<code>PCIE_ASPM_ON_BAT=powersupersave</code> basically did nothing: I was stuck
at 10W power usage in powertop (600+mA in <code>tlp-stat</code>).</p>

<p>Apparently, I should be able to reach the <code>C8</code> CPU power state (or
even <code>C9</code>, <code>C10</code>) in powertop, but I seem to be stock at
<code>C7</code>. (Although I&#39;m not sure how to read that tab in powertop: in the
<code>Core(HW</code>) column there&#39;s only C3/C6/C7 states, and most cores are 85%
in C7 or maybe C6. But the next column over <em>does</em> show many CPUs in
C10 states...</p>

<p>As it turns out, the graphics card actually takes up a good chunk of
power unless proper power management is enabled (see below). After
tweaking this, I did manage to get down to around 7W power usage in
powertop.</p>

<p>Expansion cards actually <em>do</em> take up power, and so does the screen,
obviously. The fully-lit screen takes a solid 2-3W of power compared
to the fully dimmed screen. When removing <em>all</em> expansion cards and
making the laptop idle, I can spin it down to 4 watts power usage at
the moment, and an amazing 2 watts when the screen turned off.</p>

<h3 id="caveats"><a name="index13h3"></a>Caveats</h3>

<p>Abusive (10W+) power usage that I initially found could be a problem
with my desktop configuration: I have this silly status bar that
updates every second and probably causes redraws... The CPU certainly
doesn&#39;t seem to spin down below 1GHz. Also note that this is with an
actual desktop running with everything: it could very well be that
some things (I&#39;m looking at you Signal Desktop) take up unreasonable
amount of power on their own (hello, 1W/electron, sheesh). Syncthing
and containerd (Docker!) also seem to take a good 500mW just sitting
there.</p>

<p>Beyond my desktop configuration, this could, of course, be a
Debian-specific problem; your favorite distribution might be better at
power management.</p>

<h3 id="idle-power-usage-tests"><a name="index14h3"></a>Idle power usage tests</h3>

<p>Some expansion cards waste energy, even when unused. Here is a summary
of the findings from the <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/framework-12th-gen/powerstat/">powerstat</a> page. I also include other
devices tested in this page for completeness:</p>

<p>So it looks like <em>all</em> expansion cards but the USB-C ones are active,
i.e. they draw power with idle. The USB-A cards are the least concern,
sucking out 10mW, pretty much within the margin of error. But both the
DisplayPort and HDMI do take a few hundred miliwatts. It looks like
USB-A connectors have this fundamental flaw that they necessarily draw
<em>some</em> powers because they lack the power negotiation features of
USB-C. At least <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-battery-questions-on-linux/20729/24?u=anarcat">according to this post</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>It seems the USB A must have power going to it all the time, that
the old USB 2 and 3 protocols, the USB C only provides power when
there is a connection. Old versus new.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-battery-questions-on-linux/20729/43">Apparently</a>, this is a problem <em>specific</em> to the USB-C to USB-A
adapter that ships with the Framework. Some people have <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-battery-questions-on-linux/20729/27?u=anarcat">actually
changed their orders to all USB-C</a> because of this problem, but I&#39;m
not sure the problem is as serious as claimed in the forums. I
couldn&#39;t reproduce the &#34;one watt&#34; power drains suggested elsewhere,
at least not repeatedly. (A previous version of this post <em>did</em> show
such a power drain, but it was in a less controlled test
environment than the series of more rigorous tests above.)</p>

<p>The worst offenders are the storage cards: the SSD drive takes at
least one watt of power and the MicroSD card seems to want to take all
the way up to 6 watts of power, both just sitting there doing
nothing. This confirms claims of <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/linux-battery-life-tuning/6665/179">1.4W</a> for the SSD (but not
<a href="https://community.frame.work/t/1-tb-expansion-card-consume-5w/17391">5W</a>) power usage found elsewhere. The <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/linux-battery-life-tuning/6665/179">former post</a> has
instructions on how to disable the card in software. The MicroSD card
has been reported as <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-battery-questions-on-linux/20729/33?u=anarcat">using 2 watts</a>, but I&#39;ve seen it as high as 6
watts, which is pretty damning.</p>

<p>The Framework team has <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/beta-displayport-expansion-card-firmware-update-to-reduce-system-power-consumption/22325?u=anarcat">a beta update for the DisplayPort adapter</a>
but currently only for Windows (<a href="https://community.frame.work/t/beta-displayport-expansion-card-firmware-update-to-reduce-system-power-consumption/22325/11">LVFS technically possible, &#34;under
investigation&#34;</a>). A USB-A firmware update is <em>also</em> <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/beta-displayport-expansion-card-firmware-update-to-reduce-system-power-consumption/22325/20?u=anarcat">under
investigation</a>. It is therefore likely at least some of those power
management issues will eventually be fixed.</p>

<p>Note that the upcoming <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/ethernet-expansion-card-photos-quick-start-guide-benchmarking/22574/4?u=anarcat">Ethernet card has a reported 2-8W power usage,
depending on traffic</a>. I did my own power usage tests in
<a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/framework-12th-gen/powerstat-wayland/">powerstat-wayland</a> and they seem lower than 2W.</p>

<p>The upcoming 6.2 Linux kernel might also improve battery usage when
idle, see <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Lazy-RCU-Likely-For-Linux-6.2">this Phoronix article for details</a>, likely in early
2023.</p>

<p>Update: I redid those tests under Wayland, see <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/framework-12th-gen/powerstat-wayland/">powerstat-wayland</a>
for details. The TL;DR: is that power consumption is either smaller or
similar.</p>

<p>I redid the idle tests after the <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-intel-core-bios-3-06-beta/25726">3.06 beta BIOS update</a> and ended
up with this results:</p>

<p>Note that the table summary is different than the previous table: here
we show the absolute numbers while the previous table was doing a
confusing attempt at showing relative (to the baseline) numbers.</p>

<p>Conclusion: the 3.06 BIOS update did not significantly change idle
power usage stats <em>except</em> for the MicroSD card which has
significantly improved.</p>

<p>The new &#34;external USB&#34; test is also interesting: it shows how the
provided 1TB SSD card performs (admirably) compared to existing
devices. The other new result is the MicroSD card with a card which,
interestingly, uses <em>less</em> power than the 1TB SSD drive.</p>

<h3 id="standby-battery-usage"><a name="index17h3"></a>Standby battery usage</h3>

<p>I wrote some <a href="https://anarc.at/blog/2022-09-28-suspend-battery-use/">quick hack to evaluate how much power is used during
sleep</a>. Apparently, this is one
of the areas that <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31433666">should have improved since the first Framework
model</a>, let&#39;s find out.</p>

<p>My baseline for comparison is the Purism laptop, which, in 10 minutes,
went from this:</p>

<pre><code>sep 28 11:19:45 angela systemd-sleep[209379]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT/charge_now                      =   6045 [mAh]
</code></pre>

<p>... to this:</p>

<pre><code>sep 28 11:29:47 angela systemd-sleep[209725]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT/charge_now                      =   6037 [mAh]
</code></pre>

<p>That&#39;s 8mAh per 10 minutes (and 2 seconds), or 48mA, or, with this
battery, about 127 hours or roughly 5 days of standby. Not bad!</p>

<p>In comparison, here is my really old x220, before:</p>

<pre><code>sep 29 22:13:54 emma systemd-sleep[176315]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/energy_now                     =   5070 [mWh]
</code></pre>

<p>... after:</p>

<pre><code>sep 29 22:23:54 emma systemd-sleep[176486]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/energy_now                     =   4980 [mWh]
</code></pre>

<p>... which is 90 mwH in 10 minutes, or a whopping 540mA, which was
possibly okay when this battery was new (62000 mAh, so about 100
hours, or about 5 days), but this battery is almost dead and has
<em>only</em> 5210 mAh when full, so only 10 hours standby.</p>

<p>And here is the Framework performing a similar test, before:</p>

<pre><code>sep 29 22:27:04 angela systemd-sleep[4515]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_full                    =   3518 [mAh]
sep 29 22:27:04 angela systemd-sleep[4515]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_now                     =   2861 [mAh]
</code></pre>

<p>... after:</p>

<pre><code>sep 29 22:37:08 angela systemd-sleep[4743]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_now                     =   2812 [mAh]
</code></pre>

<p>... which is 49mAh in a little over 10 minutes (and 4 seconds), or
292mA, much more than the Purism, but half of the X220. At this rate,
the battery would last on standby <em>only</em> 12 hours!! That is pretty
bad.</p>

<p>Note that this was done with the following expansion cards:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 USB-C</li>
<li>1 1TB SSD drive</li>
<li>1 USB-A with a hub connected to it, with keyboard and LAN</li>
</ul>


<p>Preliminary tests without the hub (over one minute) show that it
doesn&#39;t significantly affect this power consumption (300mA).</p>

<p><a href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Fedora+36+Installation+on+the+Framework+Laptop/108?lang=en#s655">This guide</a> also suggests booting with <code>nvme.noacpi=1</code> but this
still gives me about 5mAh/min (or 300mA).</p>

<p>Adding <code>mem_sleep_default=deep</code> to the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/power/states.txt">kernel command line</a> does make a
difference. Before:</p>

<pre><code>sep 29 23:03:11 angela systemd-sleep[3699]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_now                     =   2544 [mAh]
</code></pre>

<p>... after:</p>

<pre><code>sep 29 23:04:25 angela systemd-sleep[4039]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_now                     =   2542 [mAh]
</code></pre>

<p>... which is 2mAh in 74 seconds, which is 97mA, brings us to a more
reasonable 36 hours, or a day and a half. It&#39;s still above the x220
power usage, and more than an order of magnitude more than the Purism
laptop. It&#39;s also far from the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31442480">0.4% promised by upstream</a>, which
would be 14mA for the 3500mAh battery.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that this &#34;deep&#34; sleep mode is a little more
disruptive than regular sleep. As you can see by the timing, it took
more than 10 seconds for the laptop to resume, which feels a little
alarming as your banging the keyboard to bring it back to life.</p>

<p>You can confirm the current sleep mode with:</p>

<pre><code># cat /sys/power/mem_sleep
s2idle [deep]
</code></pre>

<p>In the above, <code>deep</code> is selected. You can change it on the fly with:</p>

<pre><code>printf s2idle &gt; /sys/power/mem_sleep
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#39;s another test:</p>

<pre><code>sep 30 22:25:50 angela systemd-sleep[32207]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_now                     =   1619 [mAh]
sep 30 22:31:30 angela systemd-sleep[32516]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_now                     =   1613 [mAh]
</code></pre>

<p>... better! 6 mAh in about 6 minutes, works out to 63.5mA, so more
than two days standby.</p>

<p>A longer test:</p>

<pre><code>oct 01 09:22:56 angela systemd-sleep[62978]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_now                     =   3327 [mAh]
oct 01 12:47:35 angela systemd-sleep[63219]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_now                     =   3147 [mAh]
</code></pre>

<p>That&#39;s 180mAh in about 3.5h, 52mA! Now at 66h, or almost 3 days.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t sure why I was seeing such fluctuations in those tests, but
as it turns out, <a href="#detailed-power-usage-tests">expansion card power tests</a> show that they <em>do</em>
significantly affect power usage, especially the SSD drive, which can
take up to two <em>full</em> watts of power even when idle. I didn&#39;t control
for expansion cards in the above tests — running them with whatever
card I had plugged in without paying attention — so it&#39;s likely the
cause of the high power usage and fluctuations.</p>

<p>It might be possible to work around this problem by <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/guide-automatically-disable-usb-devices-for-battery-savings/20392">disabling USB
devices</a> before suspend. TODO. See also <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/guide-linux-battery-life-tuning/6665/300">this post</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I have been able to get <em>much</em> better suspend
performance by unplugging <em>all</em> modules. Then I get this result:</p>

<pre><code>oct 04 11:15:38 angela systemd-sleep[257571]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_now                     =   3203 [mAh]
oct 04 15:09:32 angela systemd-sleep[257866]: /sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_now                     =   3145 [mAh]
</code></pre>

<p>Which is 14.8mA! Almost exactly the number promised by Framework! With
a full battery, that means a 10 days suspend time. This is actually
pretty good, and far beyond what I was expecting when starting down
this journey.</p>

<p>So, once the expansion cards are unplugged, suspend power usage is
actually quite reasonable. More detailed standby tests are available
in the <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/framework-12th-gen/standby-tests/">standby-tests</a> page, with a summary below.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32930511">some hope</a> that the <a href="https://frame.work/at/en/blog/introducing-the-framework-laptop-chromebook-edition">Chromebook edition</a> —
specifically designed with a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32927094">specification of 14 days standby
time</a> — could bring some firmware improvements back down to the
normal line. Some of those issues were <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/high-battery-drain-during-suspend/3736/37?u=anarcat">reported upstream in April
2022</a>, but there doesn&#39;t seem to have been any progress there
since.</p>

<p>TODO: one final solution here is <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Power_management/Suspend_and_hibernate">suspend-then-hibernate</a>, which
Windows uses for this</p>

<p>TODO: consider implementing the <a href="https://01.org/blogs/qwang59/2018/how-achieve-s0ix-states-linux">S0ix</a> sleep states , see also <a href="https://01.org/blogs/qwang59/2020/linux-s0ix-troubleshooting">troubleshooting</a></p>

<p>Conclusions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>USB-C</strong> cards take <strong>no extra power</strong> on suspend, possibly <em>less</em>
than empty slots, more testing required</p></li>
<li><p><strong>USB-A</strong> cards take a <strong><em>lot</em> more power</strong> on suspend
(<strong>300-500mW</strong>) than on regular idle (~10mW, almost negligible)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>1TB SSD</strong> and <strong>MicroSD</strong> cards seem to take a <strong>reasonable
amount of power</strong> (260-290mW), <strong>compared to their runtime
equivalents</strong> (1-6W!)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>DisplayPort</strong> takes a surprising <strong>lot of power</strong> (620mW), almost
<strong>double its average runtime</strong> usage (390mW)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>HDMI</strong> cards take, surprisingly, <strong>less power</strong> (250mW) in
standby than the DP card (620mW)</p></li>
<li><p>and oddly, a <em>second</em> card adds less power usage (70mW?!) than the
first, maybe a circuit is used by both?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Framework recently (2022-11-07) <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/wiki-replica/-/commit/f8c29ec91fb8ecdf7429c585b7f0b2fb4b8edf7b">announced</a> that they will publish
a firmware upgrade to address some of the USB-C issues, including
power management. This could positively affect the above result,
improving both <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33512510">standby</a> and runtime power usage.</p>

<p>Full results in <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/framework-12th-gen/standby-tests-306/">standby-tests-306</a>. The big takeaway for me is that
the update did <em>not</em> improve power usage on the USB-A ports which is a
big problem for my use case. There is a notable improvement on the
DisplayPort power consumption which brings it more in line with the
HDMI connector, but it still doesn&#39;t properly turn off on suspend
either.</p>

<p>Even worse, the USB-A ports now sometimes <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/responded-usb-a-expansion-card-stops-working-until-unplugged/26579?u=anarcat">fails to resume after
suspend</a>, which is pretty annoying. This is a <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-intel-core-bios-3-06-beta/25726/109?u=anarcat">known problem</a>
that will hopefully get fixed in the final release.</p>

<h3 id="battery-wear-protection"><a name="index20h3"></a>Battery wear protection</h3>

<p>The BIOS has an option to limit charge to 80% to <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/how-can-i-mitigate-battery-wear-at-home/23348">mitigate battery
wear</a>. There&#39;s a way to control the embedded controller from
runtime with fw-ectool, <a href="https://www.howett.net/posts/2021-12-framework-ec/">partly documented here</a>. The <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/how-can-i-mitigate-battery-wear-at-home/23348/8?u=anarcat">command
would be</a>:</p>

<pre><code>sudo ectool fwchargelimit 80

<p>I looked at building this myself but <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/exploring-the-embedded-controller/12846/91?u=anarcat">failed to run it</a>. I opened a

<h2 id="ethernet-expansion-card"><a name="index26h2"></a>Ethernet expansion card</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://frame.work/products/ethernet-expansion-card">Framework ethernet expansion card</a> is a fancy little doodle:
&#34;2.5Gbit/s and 10/100/1000Mbit/s Ethernet&#34;, the &#34;clear housing lets
you peek at the RTL8156 controller that powers it&#34;. Which is another
way to say &#34;we didn&#39;t completely finish prod on this one, so it kind
of looks like we 3D-printed this in the shop&#34;....</p>

<p>The card is a little bulky, but I guess that&#39;s inevitable considering
the RJ-45 form factor when compared to the thin Framework laptop.</p>

<p>I have had a <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/ethernet-expansion-card-is-not-connecting/23866">serious issue</a> when trying it at first: the link LEDs
just wouldn&#39;t come up. I made a full bug report <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/ethernet-expansion-card-is-not-connecting/23866">in the forum</a> and
with upstream support, but eventually figured it out on my own. It&#39;s
(of course) a power saving issue: if you reboot the machine, the links
come up when the laptop is running the BIOS POST check and even when
the Linux kernel boots.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/ethernet-expansion-card-is-not-connecting/23866/11?u=anarcat">first thought</a> that the problem is likely related to the
<code>powertop</code> service which I run at boot time to tweak some power saving
settings.</p>

<p>It seems like this:</p>

<pre><code>echo &#39;on&#39; &gt; &#39;/sys/bus/usb/devices/4-2/power/control&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>... is a good workaround to bring the card back online. You can even
return to power saving mode and the card will still work:</p>

<pre><code>echo &#39;auto&#39; &gt; &#39;/sys/bus/usb/devices/4-2/power/control&#39;
</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://community.frame.work/t/ethernet-expansion-card-is-not-connecting/23866/28?u=anarcat">Further research</a> by <a href="https://community.frame.work/u/Matt_Hartley">Matt_Hartley</a> from the <a href="https://community.frame.work/g/Framework">Framework
Team</a> found <a href="https://github.com/linrunner/TLP/issues/311#issuecomment-350568606">this issue in the tlp tracker</a> that shows how the
<code>USB_AUTOSUSPEND</code> <a href="https://linrunner.de/tlp/settings/usb.html">setting</a> enables the power saving <em>even if the
driver doesn&#39;t support it</em>, which, in retrospect, just sounds like a
bad idea. To quote that issue:</p>

<blockquote><p>By default, USB power saving is active in the kernel, but not
force-enabled for incompatible drivers. That is, devices that
support suspension will suspend, drivers that do not, will not.</p></blockquote>

<p>So the fix is actually to uninstall <code>tlp</code> or disable that setting by
adding this to <code>/etc/tlp.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>USB_AUTOSUSPEND=0
</code></pre>

<p>... but that disables auto-suspend on <em>all</em> USB devices, which may
hurt other power usage performance. I <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/ethernet-expansion-card-is-not-connecting/23866/44?u=anarcat">have found</a> that a a
<em>combination</em> of:</p>

<pre><code>USB_AUTOSUSPEND=1
USB_DENYLIST=&#34;0bda:8156&#34;
</code></pre>

<p><em>and</em> this on the kernel commandline:</p>

<pre><code>usbcore.quirks=0bda:8156:k
</code></pre>

<p>... actually does work correctly. I now have this in my
<code>/etc/default/grub.d/framework-tweaks.cfg</code> file:</p>

<pre><code># net.ifnames=0: normal interface names ffs (e.g. eth0, wlan0, not wlp166
s0)
# nvme.noacpi=1: reduce SSD disk power usage (not working)
# mem_sleep_default=deep: reduce power usage during sleep (not working)
# usbcore.quirk is a workaround for the ethernet card suspend bug: https:
//guides.frame.work/Guide/Fedora+37+Installation+on+the+Framework+Laptop/
108?lang=en
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=&#34;net.ifnames=0 nvme.noacpi=1 mem_sleep_default=deep usbcore.quirks=0bda:8156:k&#34;

# fix the resolution in grub for fonts to not be tiny
GRUB_GFXMODE=1024x768
</code></pre>

<p>Other than that, I haven&#39;t been able to max out the card because I
don&#39;t have other 2.5Gbit/s equipment at home, which is strangely
satisfying. But running against <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/octavia/">my</a> Turris Omnia
router, I could pretty much max a gigabit fairly easily:</p>

<pre><code>[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate         Retr
[  5]   0.00-10.00  sec  1.09 GBytes   937 Mbits/sec  238             sender
[  5]   0.00-10.00  sec  1.09 GBytes   934 Mbits/sec                  receiver
</code></pre>

<p>The card doesn&#39;t require any proprietary firmware blobs which is
surprising. Other than the power saving issues, it just works.</p>

<p>In my power tests (see <a href="https://anarc.at/hardware/laptop/framework-12th-gen/powerstat-wayland/">powerstat-wayland</a>), the Ethernet card seems
to use about 1.6W of power idle, without link, in the above &#34;quirky&#34;
configuration where the card is functional but without autosuspend.</p>

<h2 id="proprietary-firmware-blobs"><a name="index27h2"></a>Proprietary firmware blobs</h2>

<p>The framework does need proprietary firmware to operate. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>the WiFi network card shipped with the DIY kit is a AX210 card that
requires a 5.19 kernel or later, and the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/firmware%2Diwlwifi">firmware-iwlwifi</a> non-free firmware package</li>
<li>the Bluetooth adapter also loads the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/firmware%2Diwlwifi">firmware-iwlwifi</a>
package (untested)</li>
<li>the graphics work out of the box without firmware, but certain
power management features come only with special proprietary
firmware, normally shipped in the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/firmware%2Dmisc%2Dnonfree">firmware-misc-nonfree</a>
but currently missing from the package</li>
</ul>


<div><p>
Note that, at the time of writing, the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/firmware/linux-firmware.git/tree/i915?id=51fff4e69b4554dd3fee21e3c55a0f94937293e3">latest i915 firmware from
linux-firmware</a> has a <em>serious</em> bug where loading <em>all</em> the
accessible firmware results in noticeable — I estimate 200-500ms — lag
between the keyboard (not the mouse!) and the display. Symptoms also
include tearing and shearing of windows, it&#39;s pretty nasty.</p>

<p>One workaround is to delete the two affected firmware files:</p>

<pre><code>cd /lib/firmware &amp;&amp; rm adlp_guc_70.1.1.bin adlp_guc_69.0.3.bin
update-initramfs -u
</code></pre>

<p>You <em>will</em> get the following warning during build, which is <em>good</em> as
it means the problematic firmware is disabled:</p>

<pre><code>W: Possible missing firmware /lib/firmware/i915/adlp_guc_69.0.3.bin for module i915
W: Possible missing firmware /lib/firmware/i915/adlp_guc_70.1.1.bin for module i915
</code></pre>

<p>But then it also means that critical firmware isn&#39;t loaded, which
means, among other things, a higher battery drain. I was able to move
from 8.5-10W down to the 7W range after making the firmware work
properly. This is also after turning the backlight all the way down,
as that takes a solid 2-3W in full blast.</p>

<p>The proper fix is to use some compositing manager. I ended up using
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/compton">compton</a> with the following systemd unit:</p>

<pre><code>[Unit]
Description=start compositing manager
PartOf=graphical-session.target
ConditionHost=angela

[Service]
Type=exec
ExecStart=compton --show-all-xerrors --backend glx --vsync opengl-swc
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
RequiredBy=graphical-session.target
</code></pre>

<p><code>compton</code> is orphaned however, so you might be tempted to use
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/picom">picom</a> instead, but in my experience the latter uses much
more power (1-2W extra, <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/linux-battery-life-tuning/6665/259?u=anarcat">similar experience</a>). I also tried
<code>compiz</code> but it would just crash with:</p>

<pre><code>anarcat@angela:~$ compiz --replace
compiz (core) - Warn: No XI2 extension
compiz (core) - Error: Another composite manager is already running on screen: 0
compiz (core) - Fatal: No manageable screens found on display :0
</code></pre>

<p>When running from the base session, I would get this instead:</p>

<pre><code>compiz (core) - Warn: No XI2 extension
compiz (core) - Error: Couldn&#39;t load plugin &#39;ccp&#39;
compiz (core) - Error: Couldn&#39;t load plugin &#39;ccp&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/EmanueleRocca">EmanueleRocca</a> for figuring all that out. See also <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/12th-gen-power-management-on-linux/21330">this
discussion about power management on the Framework forum</a>.</p>

<p>Note that Wayland environments do not require any special
configuration here and actually work better, see my <a href="https://anarc.at/software/desktop/wayland">Wayland migration
notes</a> for details.

<p><em>Some</em> of those are available in the latest upstream firmware package
(<code>iwlwifi-ty-a0-gf-a0-71.ucode</code>, <code>-68</code>, and <code>-67</code>), but not all
(e.g. <code>iwlwifi-ty-a0-gf-a0-72.ucode</code> is missing) . It&#39;s unclear what
those do or don&#39;t, as the WiFi seems to work well without them.</p>

<p>I still copied them in from the latest linux-firmware package in the
hope they would help with power management, but I did not notice a
change after loading them.</p>

<p>There are also multiple knobs on the <code>iwlwifi</code> and <code>iwlmvm</code>
drivers. The latter has a <code>power_schmeme</code> setting which defaults to
<code>2</code> (<code>balanced</code>), setting it to <code>3</code> (<code>low power</code>) could improve
battery usage as well, in theory. The <code>iwlwifi</code> driver also has
<code>power_save</code> (defaults to disabled) and <code>power_level</code> (1-5, defaults
to <code>1</code>) settings. See also the output of <code>modinfo iwlwifi</code> and
<code>modinfo iwlmvm</code> for other driver options.
</p></div>

<h2 id="graphics-acceleration"><a name="index28h2"></a>Graphics acceleration</h2>

<p>After loading the latest upstream firmware and setting up a
compositing manager (<code>compton</code>, above), I tested the classic
<code>glxgears</code>.</p>

<p>Running in a window gives me odd results, as the gears basically grind
to a halt:</p>

<pre><code>Running synchronized to the vertical refresh.  The framerate should be
approximately the same as the monitor refresh rate.
137 frames in 5.1 seconds = 26.984 FPS
27 frames in 5.4 seconds =  5.022 FPS
</code></pre>

<p>Ouch. 5FPS!</p>

<p>But interestingly, once the window is in full screen, it does hit the
monitor refresh rate:</p>

<pre><code>300 frames in 5.0 seconds = 60.000 FPS
</code></pre>

<p>I&#39;m not really a gamer and I&#39;m not normally using any of that fancy
graphics acceleration stuff (except maybe my browser does?).</p>

<p>I installed <a href="http://packages.debian.org/intel%2Dgpu%2Dtools">intel-gpu-tools</a> for the <code>intel_gpu_top</code>
command to confirm the GPU was engaged when doing those simulations. A
nice find. Other useful diagnostic tools include <code>glxgears</code> and
<code>glxinfo</code> (in <a href="http://packages.debian.org/mesa%2Dutils">mesa-utils</a>) and (<code>vainfo</code> in <a href="http://packages.debian.org/vainfo">vainfo</a>).</p>

<p>Following to <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/linux-battery-life-tuning/6665">this post</a>, I also made sure to have those settings
in my <code>about:config</code> in Firefox, or, in <code>user.js</code>:</p>

<pre><code>user_pref(&#34;media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled&#34;, true);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the guide suggests many other settings to tweak, but those
might actually be overkill, see <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/linux-battery-life-tuning/6665/274">this comment and its parents</a>. I
did try forcing hardware acceleration by setting <code>gfx.webrender.all</code>
to <code>true</code>, but everything became choppy and weird.</p>

<p>The guide also mentions installing the <code>intel-media-driver</code> package,
but I could not find that in Debian.</p>

<p>The Arch wiki has, as usual, an excellent reference on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Firefox#Hardware_video_acceleration">hardware
acceleration in Firefox</a>.</p>

<h3 id="chromium-signal-desktop-bugs"><a name="index21h3"></a>Chromium / Signal desktop bugs</h3>

<p>It looks like both Chromium and Signal Desktop misbehave with my
compositor setup (compton + i3). The <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/debian-11-on-the-framework-laptop/10395/47">fix</a> is to add a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/chromium#Making_flags_persistent">persistent
flag</a> to Chromium. In Arch, it&#39;s conveniently in
<code>~/.config/chromium-flags.conf</code> but that doesn&#39;t actually work in
Debian. I had to put the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/run-chromium-with-flags/">flag</a> in
<code>/etc/chromium.d/disable-compositing</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>export CHROMIUM_FLAGS=&#34;$CHROMIUM_FLAGS --disable-gpu-compositing&#34;
</code></pre>

<p>It&#39;s possible another one of the <a href="https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/">hundreds of flags</a> might fix this
issue better, but I don&#39;t really have time to go through this entire,
incomplete, and unofficial list (!?!).</p>

<p>Signal Desktop is a similar problem, and doesn&#39;t reuse those flags
(because of course it doesn&#39;t). Instead I had to rewrite the wrapper
script in <code>/usr/local/bin/signal-desktop</code> to use this instead:</p>

<pre><code>exec /usr/bin/flatpak run --branch=stable --arch=x86_64 org.signal.Signal --disable-gpu-compositing &#34;$@&#34;
</code></pre>

<p>This was mostly done in <a href="https://gitlab.com/anarcat/puppet/-/commit/72fd8fa5b4bd58b9e57644b1cd0d4db1cc16cf91">this Puppet commit</a>.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t figured out the root of this problem. I did try using
<code>picom</code> and <code>xcompmgr</code>; they both suffer from the same issue. Another
Debian testing user on Wayland told me they haven&#39;t seen this problem,
so hopefully this can be fixed by switching to
<a href="https://anarc.at/software/desktop/wayland/">wayland</a>.</p>

<h3 id="graphics-card-hangs"><a name="index22h3"></a>Graphics card hangs</h3>

<p>I believe I might have <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/6851">this bug</a> which results in a total
graphical hang for 15-30 seconds. It&#39;s fairly rare so it&#39;s not <em>too</em>
disruptive, but when it <em>does</em> happen, it&#39;s pretty alarming.</p>

<p>The comments on that bug report are encouraging though: it seems this
is a bug in either mesa or the Intel graphics driver, which means many
people have this problem so it&#39;s likely to be fixed. There&#39;s actually
a <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/merge_requests/20449">merge request on mesa</a> already (2022-12-29).</p>

<p>It <em>could</em> also be <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/4858">that bug</a> because the error message I get is
actually:</p>

<pre><code>Jan 20 12:49:10 angela kernel: Asynchronous wait on fence 0000:00:02.0:sway[104431]:cb0ae timed out (hint:intel_atomic_commit_ready [i915])

</code></pre>

<p>It&#39;s a solid 30 seconds graphical hang. <em>Maybe</em> the keyboard and
everything else keeps working. The latter bug report is quite long,
with many comments, but <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/4858#note_1720746">this one from January 2023</a> seems to say
that Sway 1.8 fixed the problem. There&#39;s also an <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/4858#note_1644502">earlier patch</a> to
add an extra kernel parameter that supposedly fixes that too. There&#39;s
all sorts of other workarounds in there, for example this:</p>

<pre><code>echo &#34;options i915 enable_dc=1 enable_guc_loading=1 enable_guc_submission=1 edp_vswing=0 enable_guc=2 enable_fbc=1 enable_psr=1 disable_power_well=0&#34; | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/i915.conf
</code></pre>

<p>from <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/intel/-/issues/4858#note_1599420">this comment</a>... So that one is unsolved, as far as the
upstream drivers are concerned, but maybe could be fixed through Sway.</p>

<h2 id="weird-usb-hangs-graphical-glitches"><a name="index29h2"></a>Weird USB hangs / graphical glitches</h2>

<p>I have had weird connectivity glitches better described in <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/graphical-glitches-and-intermittent-external-usb/24521">this
post</a>, but basically: my USB keyboard and mice (connected over a
USB hub) drop keys, lag a lot or hang, and I get visual glitches.</p>

<p>The fix was to tighten the screws around the CPU on the motherboard
(!), which is, thankfully, a rather simple repair.</p>



<p>I ordered the Framework in August 2022 and received it about a month
later, which is sooner than expected because the August batch was
late.</p>

<p>People (including me) expected this to have an impact on the September
batch, but it seems Framework have been able to fix the delivery
problems and keep up with the demand.</p>

<p>As of early 2023, their website announces that laptops ship &#34;within 5
days&#34;. I have myself ordered a few expansion cards in November 2022,
and they shipped on the same day, arriving 3-4 days later.</p>

<h2 id="the-supply-pipeline"><a name="index30h2"></a>The supply pipeline</h2>

<p>There are basically 6 steps in the Framework shipping pipeline, each
(except the last) accompanied with an email notification:</p>

<ol>
<li>pre-order</li>
<li>preparing batch</li>
<li>preparing order</li>
<li>payment complete</li>
<li>shipping</li>
<li>(received)</li>
</ol>


<p>This comes from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10bhWkvOnaLhFG7RsZmb0uwKo4F8tBJWlTqXToUyIDX0/edit#gid=1658320056">crowdsourced spreadsheet</a>, which should be
updated when the status changes here.</p>

<p>I was part of the &#34;third batch&#34; of the 12th generation laptop, which
was supposed to ship in September. It ended up arriving on my door
step on September 27th, about 33 days after ordering.</p>

<p>It seems current orders are not processed in &#34;batches&#34;, but in real
time, see <a href="https://frame.work/ca/en/blog/now-in-stock-and-how-a-framework-laptop-gets-from-the-factory-to-you">this blog post for details on shipping</a>.</p>

<h2 id="shipping-trivia"><a name="index31h2"></a>Shipping trivia</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t know about the others, but my laptop shipped through no less
than <em>four</em> different airplane flights. Here are the hops it took:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoyuan,_Taiwan">Taoyuan, Taiwan</a> 2022-09-23</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska">Anchorage, Alaska, USA</a> (?!) 2022-09-24</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee, USA</a> 2022-09-25</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg">Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada</a> (!! back the wrong way!) 2022-09-26</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montr%C3%A9al%E2%80%93Mirabel_International_Airport">Mirabel, Québec, Canada</a> 2022-09-27</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal">Montréal, Québec, Canada</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I can&#39;t quite figure out how to calculate exactly how much mileage
that is, but it&#39;s huge. The ride through Alaska is surprising enough
but the bounce back through <em>Winnipeg</em> is especially weird. I guess
the route happens that way because of Fedex shipping hubs.</p>

<p>There was a related oddity when I had my Purism laptop shipped: it
left from the west coast and seemed to enter on an endless, two week
long road trip across the continental US.</p>
