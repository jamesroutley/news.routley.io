    <h1>Lessons from Writing a Compiler</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>The prototypical compilers textbook is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>600 pages on parsing theory.</li>
  <li>Three pages of type-checking a first-order type system like C.</li>
  <li>Zero pages on storing and checking the correctness of declarations (the
“symbol table”).</li>
  <li>Zero pages on the compilation model, and efficiently implementing separate
compilation.</li>
  <li>450 pages on optimization and code generation.</li>
</ol>

<p>The standard academic literature is most useful for the extreme frontend
(parsing) and the extreme backend (SSA, instruction selection and code
generation), but the middle-end is ignored. This is fine if you want to learn
how to build, e.g., the next LLVM: a fat backend with a very thin frontend.</p>

<p>But what if you’re building a compiler on top of LLVM, such that it’s <em>all</em>
frontend and middle-end? Semantic analysis, type checking, and checking the
rules of declarations are the most important parts of modern compilers because
this is where all the important diagnostics (other than syntax errors) are made.</p>

<p>This article contains some of the lessons I learned writing the compiler for
<a href="https://github.com/austral/austral">Austral</a>, a new systems programming language with linear types that
I’ve been working on for a while. The first few sections are high-level, the
rest most specific to using OCaml to write a compiler.</p>

<p>Imagine a compiler as a 2D grid. The rows are the stages of compilation: from
parsing, through the middleend, to the backend. The columns are the different
facets of the programming language being implemented. For a smaller language
like C, the different facets are: global variable declarations, enum
declarations, type declarations, function declarations, and nothing else. More
featureful languages add extra facets: interface and class definitions in C++,
<code>trait</code> and <code>impl</code> definition in Rust, etc.</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content//lessons-building-compiler/grid.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>There are, broadly, two ways to implement a compiler. In the <strong>waterfall</strong>
strategy, each stage is implemented one after the other: the complete parser,
then the complete semantic analysis pass, then the complete type checking pass,
and on to the backend stages.</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content//lessons-building-compiler/waterfall.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>Tests can be be written after each stage is finished, and this might help catch
bugs, since a shallower pipeline means fewer places to look for the source of
the bug. It is difficult to identify where bugs happen in a compiler with many
tens of intermediate representations, when you only have end-to-end tests.</p>

<p>The downside is getting to “Hello, world!” takes a very long time. When writing
a compiler for an existing language, this matters less. But when building a new
language, you want something you can play with at an early stage, so you can
find what sticks out in the language design, what needs polishing, and what the
language pragmatics are.</p>

<p>However, the reality of development pressures and expedience means the end
result looks more like:</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content//lessons-building-compiler/warnings.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>With error diagnostics and semantic analysis checks being what is typically left
out.</p>

<p>The alternative is the <strong>verticals</strong> strategy, where, at the beginning of
development, you implement <em>all</em> stages of compilation, but they do nothing. The
parser parses empty files, the ASTs types are empty or have only perfunctory
placeholder cases, the backend emits nothing. And then you implement each
language facet, one at a time.</p>

<p><img src="https://borretti.me/assets/content//lessons-building-compiler/facets.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>The advantage of this is that from the start you have a compiler you can invoke
and test. Having end-to-end tests from the start is a huge boon both in terms of
ensuring the compiler implements the language definition <em>and</em> identifying
regressions.</p>

<p>While in the waterfall strategy you can focus on ensuring each stage of
compilation is correct, with the verticals strategy you can focus on ensuring
each facet of the language being implemented is correct.</p>

<p>The problem is you’re not implementing <em>the</em> language, but rather a succession
of concentric subsets of the language, until you get to feature-completeness.</p>

<p>Austral’s compiler was written with a very unprincipled, waterfall-ish strategy:
I went stage by stage, but omitting some harder-to-implement features,
diagnostics, and checks, and then went back and filled those in. I have a sense
that the strategy of proceeding by verticals is better, but I can’t endorse
either strategy because I haven’t compared them.</p>



<p>I’ve a whole graveyard of half-finished compiler projects and toy interpreters
in my drive, in everything from C, C++, Common Lisp, Standard ML, Java, Haskell
and OCaml.</p>

<p>OCaml sits at a comfortable point in language space for building compilers. It
has enough tutorials and practical documentation to be productive. It has all
the functional programming features you want: algebraic data types and pattern
matching with exhaustiveness checking. But it’s not too strict, and you write
imperative code if you want.</p>

<p>And OCaml is not terribly big-brained, so you don’t have to be put off. You can
ignore much of the language and write spartan, workmanlike OCaml that solves the
problem and doesn’t leave potential contributors scratching their head.</p>

<p>Compilers are unusual in that they rarely require large ecosystems, unlike most
modern applications. A good parser generator is all you need, so using more
obscure languages like OCaml does not involve paying as much of a cost, as, say,
writing a web app in Haskell vs. Python. You won’t find yourself having to
reinvent the entire ecosystem from scratch because few dependencies you need
don’t exist.</p>



<p>You need a parser. This is the most mind-numbing part of the compiler. Writing a
parser by hand is tricky and not worth the alleged performance
increases<sup id="fnref:perf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:perf" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Parsing performance likely won’t be the bottleneck.</p>

<p>Parser combinators are very popular. It’s cute that you can parameterize
grammars by making them into functions. But the problem with parser combinators
is they implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar">parsing expression grammars</a>. PEGs are popular too, but
they’re too rigid.</p>

<p>In a PEG, the disjunction or choice operator (typically denoted by the pipe
character <code>|</code>) is <em>ordered</em> choice. If you have a context-free grammar like <code>foo
:= a | b | c</code>, you can expect the parser generator to be smart about which case
to take given input.</p>

<p>In PEGs – and, therefore, in parser combinators – choices are tried in the
order in which they are listed. This leads to huge headaches.</p>

<p>Things like left recursion lead to difficult to debug infinite loops, you will
have to contort your grammar to fit the rules of PEG. The end result does <em>not</em>
look like the cute parser combinator one-liners that draw everyone in.</p>

<p>Good old fashioned parser generators like Menhir or ANTLR don’t have this
problem. Choice is unordered, like in the EBNF notation you find in language
specifications. Left recursion is implemented “intelligently”, usually without
requiring you to transform your grammar.</p>

<p>Menhir is a mature parser generator. It is integrated into OCaml’s build system:
<a href="https://dune.build/">dune</a>. The documentation is alright, but there’s enough practical
tutorials to get you started.</p>



<p>There’s, roughly, two kinds of tests:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Unit tests are written in the same language the compiler is written in. In my
case, OCaml.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>End-to-end tests. Here you have a test runner that treats the compiler as a
black box: a binary file that is invoked with command line arguments. Tests
can either check that compilation <em>fails</em> and produces an expected set of
error messages, or that compilation <em>succeeds</em> and the generated program,
when executed, produces expected output.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You should write end-to-end tests first. Yes, they are coarse-grained, and they
may not help you figure out exactly <em>where</em> in the compiler a bug resides. But
the benefit is that they treat the compiler as a black box, which lets you
iterate the compiler’s internals without causing tests to break. You can change
the AST structure, intermediate representation, passes, environment
representation, backend, everything, as long as the CLI interface remains the
same. This is useful for early-stage development where things are changing
rapidly.</p>

<p>Investing time in writing a good end-to-end test runner was a huge boon for the
development of the Austral compiler. I wish I had done it earlier.</p>

<p>Having lots of very specific unit tests for every aspect of a pass is useful
mainly when the compiler has reached a stage of maturity where its internals are
fixed. If you are still iterating on the internals, those tests are a liability:
they will fail to compile (due to the changes you made to the compiler’s code)
more often than they will catch bugs.</p>

<p>Caveat: Languages differ by how convenient they make writing tests, and what is
convenient is what gets written. I find myself writing a lot more tests in
Python, for example, than in OCaml. Partly because Python makes fewer guarantees
at compile time, and partly because Python’s dynamism makes things like test
autodiscovery easier.</p>



<p>The simplest compiler is a whole-program compiler: it processes an ordered set
of files, one after the other, and spits out generated code for the whole
thing. The module dependency DAG can be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topologically sorted</a> to a linear order.</p>

<p>For an MVP language, this is fine, because very little code is written in the
language. The problem is scalability: whole-program compilation for large
codebases is intrinsically slow.</p>

<p>Being able to typecheck, compile, and run code at a high frequency makes
development less frustrating. Having to wait ten seconds to build hundreds of
thousands of lines of code, <em>ab initio</em>, for every change that you make is
frustrating. Performance requires separate compilation.</p>

<p>Separate compilation requires careful thinking. It can’t be an afterthought of
language design: you have to design the language’s module system and compilation
model with separate compilation in mind. Having this figured out and sketched
out from the start is a good idea.</p>



<p>It’s generally good to separate <em>intermediate representations</em> from
<em>passes</em>. The former are types, the latter are a set of functions. This helps
keep modules short and to the point. Besides, there’s not always a one-to-one
mapping from IRs to passes, you will be running multiple different analysis
passes on the same representation.</p>

<p>The exception to this is where it would break encapsulation. Sometimes you want
types to be opaque, so that the module that defines them can enforce invariants
about their contents.</p>



<p><em>(This section only applies to new programming languages and not e.g. Fortran)</em></p>

<p>Compilers are often written in the language they compile. This shows the
language is mature enough to handle the non-trivial task of building a compiler,
and it also makes contributions easier, because contributors only need to know
one language, rather than both the host and implementation languages.</p>

<p>So, you’ve decided to build a new programming language, but you can’t write the
compiler in a non-existent language. The basic idea here is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Write the <strong>bootstrapping compiler</strong>, in a language like OCaml.</li>
  <li>Write the <strong>self-hosting compiler</strong>, in your new language, and use the
bootstrapping compiler to build it.</li>
</ol>

<p>When do you move on from 1 to 2? Writing the simplest, dumbest possible MVP
compiler is a good idea: it lets you iterate with the language early and see
what makes sense and what doesn’t. Immediately jumping off to build a production
compiler at this stage is a bad idea: building a compiler is hard, and if your
only tool is a rickety MVP compiler held together by spit and bailing wire,
writing the self-hosting compiler will take longer and be more frustrating than
it should be.</p>

<p>The bootstrapping compiler doesn’t have a set expiration date. You can
iteratively improve it until there’s enough interest in, and users of, the
language to justify the time investment in writing a second, production-quality
compiler.</p>

<p>If iterative improvement is too slow, you can take the Fred Brooks route: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month#The_pilot_system">throw
the first one away</a>. Build a brain-dead simple bootstrapping compiler in
OCaml, then rewrite it from scratch into a production-quality compiler—but
still in OCaml. And then only migrate to the self-hosted compiler when the
language is mature enough that this is worth doing.</p>



<p>The <strong>environment</strong> (also called the <strong><em>symbol table</em></strong>, especially in compilers
for C-like languages) is where user declarations, like type definitions and
function definitions, are stored. This is the central data structure in a
compiler.</p>

<p>Type checking, which is easily the largest part of modern language compilers,
requires pervasive access to the environment. For example, to typecheck a
function call, you need the function’s signature, which comes from the
environment. Constructor calls require the definition of the type being
constructed, which comes from the environment. The environment is also the
natural place to store extra information that is not strictly needed for
compilation but lets you provide richer diagnostics, such as the cross-reference
graph. An API documentation generator can draw essentially all the information
it needs from the environment.</p>

<p>Despite the centrality of the environment, compiler literature typically glosses
over it, for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, most textbook compilers are for relatively simple, C-like
languages. Since C has no explicit modules and a global namespace, and only
four kinds of declarations (global variables, enums, types, and functions),
the environment can be very simple: it’s literally just a hash table from
declaration names to definitions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Compiler textbooks typically focus on the executable part of source text: the
bodies of functions. This is where most optimizations, control flow analysis,
SSA, code generation etc. happen.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The language determines how sophisticated the environment has to be. C and C++
can have relatively simple environments. Ada, which has a more complicated
module system, requires a correspondingly more complicated environment. So some
of this advice is not portable across languages, and an environment data
structure that works for one may be lacking for another.</p>

<p>Austral is a relatively simple language. Code is organized in modules, which
have names, and are non-hierarchical<sup id="fnref:hierarchy" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hierarchy" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Modules contain declarations,
of which there are six kinds: constants, records, unions, functions, type
classes, and type class instances. All declarations <em>except</em> type class
instances can be identified by a name.</p>

<p>In the Austral compiler, the environment is an opaque type that’s only
accessible through an API. Internally, it is a set of tables, where each table
stores a different kind of language object. There’s a table of modules, whose
rows looks like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>mod_rec</span> <span>=</span> <span>ModRec</span> <span>of</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>mod_id</span><span>;</span>
      <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>module_name</span><span>;</span>
      <span>interface_file</span><span>:</span> <span>file_id</span> <span>option</span><span>;</span>
      <span>interface_docstring</span><span>:</span> <span>docstring</span><span>;</span>
      <span>body_file</span><span>:</span> <span>file_id</span><span>;</span>
      <span>body_docstring</span><span>:</span> <span>docstring</span><span>;</span>
      <span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>module_kind</span><span>;</span>
      <span>(** Whether or not the module is unsafe. *)</span>
      <span>imported_instances</span><span>:</span> <span>DeclIdSet</span><span>.</span><span>t</span><span>;</span>
      <span>(** The set of imported typeclass instances. *)</span>
      <span>imports_from</span><span>:</span> <span>ModIdSet</span><span>.</span><span>t</span><span>;</span>
      <span>(** The set of modules this module imports from. *)</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In addition to this there’s a table of declarations, a table of typeclass
instance methods, and a table of monomorphs (to implement generics).</p>

<p>The environment has a simple CRUD API, and each function basically performs
integrity checks like ensuring that you don’t have two declarations with the
same name in the same module.</p>

<p>Rows are indexed by a typed ID, but can be retrieved by name where applicable
or, where necessary, by a predicate over rows.</p>

<p>Rows in one table can refer to rows in another using the typed identifiers. The
CRUD functions can enforce relational integrity, ensuring, for example, that if
you add a type class instance to the environment, the type class it links to
exists already.</p>

<p>The environment, then, is just a record of tables storing different specific
language constructs. The idea comes from reading the source code of
<a href="https://github.com/coalton-lang/coalton">Coalton</a>, a typed, ML-inspired Lisp built on top of Common Lisp by
<a href="https://twitter.com/stylewarning">Robert Smith</a>, whom you should follow on Twitter.</p>

<p>In an earlier version of the Austral compiler, the environment matched the
structure of language constructs: it was a map from module names to module
objects, and module objects were basically a map from declaration names to
declaration objects. But making updates to deeply nested structure is
inconvenient. So the concrete lesson here is: <em>keep the environment flat</em>.</p>

<p>If I had time to refactor the environment, I think I’d structure it like
this. First, define an interface along the lines of this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>type</span> <span>ENVIRONMENT</span> <span>=</span> <span>sig</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>id</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>row</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>row_input</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>table</span>

    <span>val</span> <span>empty</span> <span>:</span> <span>table</span>

    <span>(* Create *)</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>store</span> <span>:</span> <span>table</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row_input</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>id</span>

    <span>(* Retrieve *)</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>get</span> <span>:</span> <span>table</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>id</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span> <span>option</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>filter</span> <span>:</span> <span>table</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>(</span><span>row</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span> <span>list</span>

    <span>(* Update *)</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>replace</span> <span>:</span> <span>table</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>id</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row_input</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>table</span>

    <span>(* Delete *)</span>
    <span>val</span> <span>delete</span> <span>:</span> <span>table</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>id</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>table</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(<code>row_input</code> is basically <code>row</code> but without the ID. The only way to create an ID
should be by adding a row to a table. So the table has to keep an internal row
ID counter.)</p>

<p>This is the most basic interface, relying exclusively on IDs for identifying
rows. Most—but not necessarily all—language constructs are identifiable by
name, so it is reasonable to create a more specific interface:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>type</span> <span>NAME_ENVIRONMENT</span> <span>=</span> <span>sig</span>
    <span>include</span> <span>ENVIRONMENT</span>

    <span>type</span> <span>name</span>

    <span>val</span> <span>get_by_name</span> <span>:</span> <span>table</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>name</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>row</span> <span>option</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then I’d implement the different environments like so (omitting some details
for simplicity):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>module</span> <span>ModuleEnv</span> <span>:</span> <span>NAME_ENVIRONMENT</span> <span>=</span> <span>sig</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>mod_id</span>

    <span>type</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>module_name</span>

    <span>type</span> <span>row</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>mod_id</span><span>;</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>module_name</span><span>;</span> <span>docstring</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>type</span> <span>row_input</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>module_name</span><span>;</span> <span>docstring</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>type</span> <span>table</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>next_row_id</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>;</span> <span>rows</span><span>:</span> <span>row</span> <span>list</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>(* ... functions implemented here ... *)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>type</span> <span>decl</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>ConstDecl</span> <span>of</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>identifier</span><span>;</span> <span>type</span><span>:</span> <span>ty</span><span>;</span> <span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>expr</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>RecordDecl</span> <span>of</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>identifier</span><span>;</span> <span>typarams</span><span>:</span> <span>typarams</span><span>;</span> <span>fields</span><span>:</span> <span>field</span> <span>list</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>...</span>

<span>module</span> <span>DeclEnv</span> <span>:</span> <span>NAME_ENVIRONMENT</span> <span>=</span> <span>sig</span>
    <span>type</span> <span>id</span> <span>=</span> <span>decl_id</span>

    <span>type</span> <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>identifier</span>

    <span>type</span> <span>row</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>decl_id</span><span>;</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>identifier</span><span>;</span> <span>decl</span><span>:</span> <span>decl</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>type</span> <span>row_input</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>identifier</span><span>;</span> <span>decl</span><span>:</span> <span>decl</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>type</span> <span>table</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>next_row_id</span><span>:</span> <span>int</span><span>;</span> <span>rows</span><span>:</span> <span>row</span> <span>list</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>(* ... *)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally wrap up all the environments into a single <code>env</code> type:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>type env = Env of {
    module_env: ModuleEnv.table;
    decl_env: DeclEnv.table;
    ...
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>env</code> API consists of thin wrappers around the functions in the underlying
table modules, plus whatever integrity checks you have to enforce. For a
functional implementation, a function to insert a declaration would:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take the declarations environment out of the <code>env</code>.</li>
  <li>Mutate it using <code>DeclEnv.store</code>.</li>
  <li>Replace it back into an <code>env</code> instance.</li>
  <li>Return the new <code>env</code>.</li>
</ol>



<p>You need a way to identify declarations, so that AST nodes can point to
them. Most declarations can be identified by their name. If you have:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>namespace</span> <span>foo</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>void</span> <span>bar</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then the function <code>bar</code> can be identified by the string <code>foo::bar</code>. In most
languages this is all it takes. But some languages – Haskell, Rust, Austral –
have declarations that don’t have identifying names. Namely, type class/trait
instances:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>a</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>foo</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>Int</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>foo</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>&#34;Int&#34;</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>Float</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>foo</span> <span>_</span> <span>=</span> <span>&#34;Float&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Instances are identified not by name but by the <code>(typeclass name, type)</code> pair.</p>

<p>A uniform, general, type-safe way to refer to declarations is to simply use
typed, opaque identifiers, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>module_id</span>
<span>type</span> <span>decl_id</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Or, if you want to be more specific:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span> <span>module_id</span>

<span>type</span> <span>decl_id</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>DeclIdConst</span> <span>of</span> <span>const_id</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>DeclIdType</span> <span>of</span> <span>type_id</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>DeclIdFunc</span> <span>of</span> <span>func_id</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>DeclIdClass</span> <span>of</span> <span>class_id</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>DeclIdInstance</span> <span>of</span> <span>instance_id</span>

<span>type</span> <span>const_id</span>
<span>type</span> <span>type_id</span>
<span>type</span> <span>func_id</span>
<span>type</span> <span>class_id</span>
<span>type</span> <span>instance_id</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Typed identifiers have fewer degrees of freedom than strings. In addition, you
can design your API such that declaration identifiers cannot be constructed
manually, rather, they can only be created by storing declarations in the
environment:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>val store_constant_decl : env -&gt; (name * type * value) -&gt; (env * const_id)
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Initially, I wanted to have something along the lines of this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>Identifier</span>
<span>open</span> <span>Type</span>

<span>type</span> <span>err</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>NoSuchName</span> <span>of</span> <span>identifier</span>
  <span>(** No identifier with name found in the environment. *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>TypeMismatch</span> <span>of</span> <span>{</span> <span>expected</span><span>:</span> <span>ty</span><span>;</span> <span>got</span><span>:</span> <span>ty</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span>
  <span>(** Type error: expected a type other than what we got. *)</span>
  <span>|</span>
  <span>...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An error being just a giant variant of different error cases. The problem with
this is dependencies: the <code>Error</code> module has to import <code>identifier</code> from the
<code>Identifier</code> module, <code>ty</code> (the type to represent Austral types) from the <code>Type</code>
module. Which means those modules can’t raise errors, because importing the
<code>Error</code> module would be a circular dependency. This is a problem as new types of
errors are added.</p>

<p>One solution would be to split each module into two: a module that has the
types, and another that has the functions, e.g. <code>Type</code> and <code>TypeSystem</code>. Then
<code>Error</code> can just import the types, and the modules that have actual code in them
(and can raise errors) can import the <code>Error</code> module. This breaks encapsulation:
sometimes, you want opaque types, hidden behind an interface. Yes, even in
functional programming.</p>

<p>I have a much better solution at present:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(** An Austral compiler error. The module name, span, and source context rarely
    have to be passed in explicitly: they are added where the error is throw in
    the context of {!adorn_error_with_span}. *)</span>
<span>type</span> <span>austral_error</span> <span>=</span> <span>AustralError</span> <span>of</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>module_name</span><span>:</span> <span>module_name</span> <span>option</span><span>;</span>
      <span>(** The name of the module where the error occurred, if available. *)</span>
      <span>kind</span><span>:</span> <span>error_kind</span><span>;</span>
      <span>(** The error kind. *)</span>
      <span>text</span><span>:</span> <span>err_text</span> <span>list</span><span>;</span>
      <span>(** The error text. *)</span>
      <span>span</span><span>:</span> <span>span</span> <span>option</span><span>;</span>
      <span>(** The source span where the error happened, if available. *)</span>
      <span>source_ctx</span><span>:</span> <span>source_ctx</span> <span>option</span><span>;</span>
      <span>(** The source code where the error happened, if available. *)</span>
    <span>}</span>

<span>(** Represents a category of errors. *)</span>
<span>type</span> <span>error_kind</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>ParseError</span>
  <span>(** A parse error. *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>TypeError</span>
  <span>(** A type error. *)</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>InternalError</span>
  <span>(** An internal error in the compiler. *)</span>

<span>(** An individual error text element. *)</span>
<span>and</span> <span>err_text</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Text</span> <span>of</span> <span>string</span>
  <span>(** Human-readable prose. *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Code</span> <span>of</span> <span>string</span>
  <span>(** Austral text, like the name of an identifier or a type. *)</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Break</span>
  <span>(** A paragraph break. *)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An <code>austral_error</code> is a fairly generic record, it stores:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The name of the module where the error is thrown.</li>
  <li>The kind (essentially a typed title).</li>
  <li>The source span where the error happened (file, line/column interval).</li>
  <li>The source context, which is the source code at the given span plus a few
lines before and after.</li>
  <li>Finally, the error message using the <code>err_text</code> type. This is essentially a
very minimalistic markup language so we can render text both to the console
and as HTML.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the error as a value. You can wrap it in an exception:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(** The exception that carries Austral errors. *)</span>
<span>exception</span> <span>Austral_error</span> <span>of</span> <span>austral_error</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Errors are constructed like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>AustralError</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>module_name</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>;</span>
    <span>span</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>;</span>
    <span>source_ctx</span> <span>=</span> <span>None</span><span>;</span>
    <span>kind</span> <span>=</span> <span>TypeError</span><span>;</span>
    <span>text</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>Text</span> <span>&#34;Expected a value of type&#34;</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Code</span> <span>(</span><span>type_string</span> <span>a</span><span>);</span>
        <span>Text</span> <span>&#34;, but got a value of type&#34;</span><span>;</span>
        <span>Code</span> <span>(</span><span>type_string</span> <span>b</span><span>);</span>
    <span>];</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then thrown by being wrapped in an exception.</p>

<p>The module name, span, and source context are optional because they don’t have
to be passed in where the error is thrown. Rather, code that’s higher up the
call tree can catch an error, put that contextual information in, and rethrow
the error. This means you don’t have to pass the contextual information all the
way down the call tree, you can just add it at the point where it is convenient:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(** Run the callback, and if it throws an error that doesn&#39;t have a span, put
    the given span in the error and rethrow it. *)</span>
<span>let</span> <span>adorn_error_with_span</span> <span>(</span><span>new_span</span><span>:</span> <span>span</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span><span>:</span> <span>unit</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>&#39;</span><span>a</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>&#39;</span><span>a</span> <span>=</span>
  <span>try</span>
    <span>f</span> <span>()</span>
  <span>with</span> <span>Austral_error</span> <span>error</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>AustralError</span> <span>{</span> <span>module_name</span><span>;</span> <span>kind</span><span>;</span> <span>text</span><span>;</span> <span>span</span><span>;</span> <span>source_ctx</span> <span>})</span> <span>=</span> <span>error</span> <span>in</span>
    <span>(* Does the error we caught already have a span? *)</span>
    <span>match</span> <span>span</span> <span>with</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>Some</span> <span>_</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
       <span>(* The error already has a span, do nothing. *)</span>
       <span>raise</span> <span>(</span><span>Austral_error</span> <span>error</span><span>)</span>
    <span>|</span> <span>None</span> <span>-&gt;</span>
       <span>(* Create a new AustralError object with the new span, and rethrow it *)</span>
       <span>let</span> <span>new_err</span> <span>=</span> <span>AustralError</span> <span>{</span> <span>module_name</span><span>;</span> <span>kind</span><span>;</span> <span>text</span><span>;</span> <span>span</span> <span>=</span> <span>Some</span> <span>new_span</span><span>;</span> <span>source_ctx</span> <span>}</span> <span>in</span>
       <span>raise</span> <span>(</span><span>Austral_error</span> <span>new_err</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, having an ID is proof that a declaration exists.</p>



<p>Writing a correct, production-quality compiler with useful diagnostics is
difficult and time consuming work. However, it can be some of the most rewarding
work in software engineering, because compilers communicate with the messy real
world through a very narrow interface at the beginning: the parser. Beyond that,
you have a great deal of freedom to experiment with new ways of organizing
software, you can be as original and avant-garde as you want.</p>
