    <h1>UML Diagrams Designer via Code</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>SequenceDiagram.org is an online tool / software for creating UML sequence diagrams. Founded in 2014 with the purpose to improve
                the efficiency when creating and working with sequence diagrams by combining text notation scripting and drawing by clicking and dragging in the
                same model.</p>

            <p>All parsing, processing, and drawing is done client side. The benefit of this is that SequenceDiagram.org is fast and convenient to work with;
                it also doesnâ€™t transfer your diagram data over the Internet like many other sequence diagram tools on the market. This also means that it is
                possible to work with the tool offline.</p>

            <p>The tool is developed, maintained, and used by people who create a lot of sequence diagrams in their daily work. If you have any question / comments
                / suggestions / bugs please contact info@sequencediagram.org. The more feedback we get the better we can prioritize.</p></div></div>
