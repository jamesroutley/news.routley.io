			Recently, I received a wireless thermometer from Thermoworks to try out. Their newest product is called Smoke and is specifically designed to help people barbecue and smoke food at home. Smoke has two parts - a base unit (which takes two of Thermoworks standardized Pro-Series probes) and a wireless receiver unit - which lets the user track the air temperature and the food temperature without going outside to the smoker.</p></div>

			These days when I reach for a spatula to turn food in a pan, I&#39;ve been finding myself grabbing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZH6JUK?tag=cfe-20">GastroMax Slotted Turner</a> more often than not. Tina bought this spatula for me after months (or maybe years) of listening to me complain about our various spatulas. After buying the GastroMax Turner, my complaining has stopped.</p></div>

		<p>
			
			In most American supermarkets, beef is sold with a USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) Quality Grade. Most people know that USDA Prime is the best (and most expensive) beef you can buy, and it is somewhat rare to find. USDA Choice and Select grades are common in supermarkets with Select being the cheaper option. But, what do the grades mean and how are they determined? I&#39;ll try to explain...

			I find that whenever you&#39;re discussing a topic with or trying to explain something to others, it&#39;s best to have a common vocabulary. This is true in the kitchen as much as it is in the professional world. Here is my kitchen dictionary, compiled from the top of my head, the internet, and various cookbooks.
