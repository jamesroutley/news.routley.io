			Recently, I received a wireless thermometer from Thermoworks to try out. Their newest product is called Smoke and is specifically designed to help people barbecue and smoke food at home. Smoke has two parts - a base unit (which takes two of Thermoworks standardized Pro-Series probes) and a wireless receiver unit - which lets the user track the air temperature and the food temperature without going outside to the smoker.</p></div>

			These days when I reach for a spatula to turn food in a pan, I&#39;ve been finding myself grabbing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZH6JUK?tag=cfe-20">GastroMax Slotted Turner</a> more often than not. Tina bought this spatula for me after months (or maybe years) of listening to me complain about our various spatulas. After buying the GastroMax Turner, my complaining has stopped.</p></div>

			Curry is a general categorization of a type of spicy dish popular all around the world. But when asked to explain what curry is to someone who has never had it, it&#39;s surprisingly difficult. Is it a paste, soupy mixture, spice, or powder? Let&#39;s see if we can clear it up a bit.

			The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001ECHXVC?tag=cfe-20">Little Partners Learning Tower</a> will probably be useful only for parents, but, it is so good at what it does, that I think everyone should know about it. If you don&#39;t have young kids, but, you know someone who does, this might be the ultimate gift that will be used for years to come.</p></div>
