			Recently, I received a wireless thermometer from Thermoworks to try out. Their newest product is called Smoke and is specifically designed to help people barbecue and smoke food at home. Smoke has two parts - a base unit (which takes two of Thermoworks standardized Pro-Series probes) and a wireless receiver unit - which lets the user track the air temperature and the food temperature without going outside to the smoker.</p></div>

			These days when I reach for a spatula to turn food in a pan, I&#39;ve been finding myself grabbing the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DZH6JUK?tag=cfe-20">GastroMax Slotted Turner</a> more often than not. Tina bought this spatula for me after months (or maybe years) of listening to me complain about our various spatulas. After buying the GastroMax Turner, my complaining has stopped.</p></div>

			Many recipes call for skinless, boneless chicken breast. If you&#39;ve bought whole chicken breast (with bones) or you&#39;re <a href="http://cookingforengineers.com/article.php?id=97">sectioning a whole chicken</a>, then there&#39;s a good chance that at some point you&#39;ll find yourself desiring to debone your chicken breasts for a recipe. Here&#39;s a step by step guide.

			Yesterday, in one of my lazy moods, I succumbed to the microwave pizza dinner. Opening the box, I noticed the instructions mentioned placing the frozen pizza on a shiny, metallic disk but only if I used the microwave and not the oven. This got me thinking about the effect of the disk on the pizza and so I did a little research on the browning of foods.
