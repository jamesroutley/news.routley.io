			Since a major aspect of cooking is the heating of ingredients, temperature is an important topic. In cooking, we are primarily concerned in the temperature of our cooking environment (such as deep frying oil) and the temperature of our food (like a roast). With some foods, if the temperature of an ingredient has passed a certain point, it&#39;s texture and flavor changes such that we call it overdone. With other dishes, like pot roast, a minimum temperature must be reached to produce the desired effect. With lean steaks and roasts, there is a very small window which enables us to serve the dish as the perfect temperature. A thermometer is an invaluable tool in the kitchen.

			Pears are pomes (fruits with distinct cores of seeds from the Rose family) which have been cultivated for thousands of years. Although they are cousins of the apple, pears are much more delicate. Once ripe, pears should be consumed within days even with the aid of refrigeration.
