<p dir="auto">Wireguard client that exposes itself as a socks5 proxy or tunnels</p>

<p dir="auto">wireproxy is a completely userspace application that connects to a wireguard peer,
and exposes a socks5 proxy or tunnels on the machine. This can be useful if you need
to connect to certain sites via a wireguard peer, but do not want to setup a new network
interface for whatever reasons.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>You simply want wireguard as a way to proxy some traffic</li>
<li>You don&#39;t want root permission just to change wireguard settings</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Currently I am running wireproxy connected to a wireguard server in another country,
and configured my browser to use wireproxy for certain sites. It is pretty useful since
wireproxy is completely isolated from my network interfaces, also I don&#39;t need root to configure
anything.</p>

<p dir="auto"><code>./wireproxy [config file path]</code></p>
