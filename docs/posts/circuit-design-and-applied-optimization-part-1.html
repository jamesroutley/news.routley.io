<p>It&#39;s a cold fall afternoon, and you just rushed into your afternoon circuits lab a couple of minutes. The TA greets you with your lab checkoff sheet for today. It looks like you will be learning about op-amps and the 555 timer chip. The first main checkoff has you building a circuit to make the chip produce a square wave on the output. Skipping around the material in your lab notebook, you find a simple example circuit of the chip that you will need to make.</p>
