    <h1>0019: Refactor</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>I&#39;m going to make this newsletter public. Reasons:</p><ul><li>As best I can tell, most of my sponsors don&#39;t much care about the newsletter itself and just want to support writing/coding. Some don&#39;t even know it exists because github kinda buries the checkbox.</li><li>I&#39;m trying to orient my own consumption towards deliberate explorations of specific subjects rather than the froth of daily news. It seems hypocritical to then be offering infotainment as an incentive.</li><li>The blog format of scattered-thoughts.net incentivizes append-only writing. For a long while I&#39;ve wanted to instead split it into two sections: long-lived articles that I expand and update over time, and a devlog/changelog for more transient information. But I&#39;ve held off because the contents of the devlog would overlap so much with this newsletter.</li></ul><p>So this will be the last update via github. Future updates appear via <a href="https://github.com/atom.xml">atom</a>, <a href="https://tinyletter.com/jamii">tinyletter</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/sc13ts">twitter</a>, and the archive will be visible at the bottom of the front page of <a href="https://scattered-thoughts.net">scattered-thoughts.net</a>.</p><p>I expect that future updates will contain fewer random links and more half-formed thoughts and work-in-progress. If you were only here for the infotainment and don&#39;t want to sponsor me anymore - no hard feelings.</p><p>But I think in the long run this will lead to better work, especially as I focus on shipping actual usable demos this year. Reading less froth will also leave me with more time to fit in smaller projects, and I&#39;ve no shortage of ideas for those:</p><pre><code><span>&gt; wc ideas.md
</span><span> 1479  4740 31864 ideas.md
</span></code></pre><hr/><p>As a reminder, new <a href="https://calendly.com/sc13ts/">office hours</a> slots appear automatically every Friday, two weeks in advance. They are still filling up quickly but I expect demand to die down over time. If not, maybe I&#39;ll make some sponsors-only slots.</p></article></div>
