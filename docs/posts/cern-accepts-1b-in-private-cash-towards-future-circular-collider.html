								<p>The CERN particle-physics lab near Geneva <a href="https://home.cern/news/press-release/cern/private-donors-pledge-860-million-euros-cerns-future-circular-collider">has received $1bn</a> from private donors towards the construction of the <a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/future-circular-collider">Future Circular Collider</a> (FCC). The cash marks the first time in the lab’s 72-year history that individuals and philanthropic foundations have agreed to support a major CERN project. If built, the FCC would be the successor to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), where the Higgs boson was discovered.</p>
<p>CERN originally released <a href="https://physicsworld.com/a/europe-unveils-successor-to-the-large-hadron-collider/">a four-volume conceptual design report</a> for the FCC in early 2019, with more detail included in a <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2928193">three-volume feasibility study</a> that came out last year. It calls for a giant tunnel some 90.7 km in circumference – roughly three times as long as the LHC  – that would be built about 200 m underground on average.</p>
<p>The FCC has been recommended as the preferred option for the next flagship collider at CERN in the <a href="https://url.uk.m.mimecastprotect.com/s/xtPXC0Rv8tvN53FRhwF9G-Hn?domain=u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net">ongoing process to update the European Strategy for Particle Physics</a>, which will be passed over to the  CERN Council in May 2026.If the plans are given the green light by CERN Council in 2028, construction on the FCC electron-positron machine, dubbed FCC-ee, would begin in 2030. It would start operations in 2047, a few years after the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) closes down, and run for about 15 years until the early 2060s.</p>
<p>The FCC-ee would focus on creating a million Higgs particles in total to allow physicists to study its properties with an accuracy an order of magnitude better that possible with the LHC. The FCC feasibility study then calls for a hadron machine, dubbed FCC-hh, to replace the FCC-ee in the existing 91 km tunnel. It would be a “discovery machine”, smashing together protons at high energy – about 85 TeV – with the aim of creating new particles. If built, the FCC-hh will begin operation in 2073 and run to the end of the century.</p>
<p>The funding model for the FCC-ee, which is expected to have a price tag of about $18bn, is still a work in progress. But it is estimated that at least two-thirds of the construction costs will come from CERN’s 24 member states with the rest needing to be found elsewhere. One option to plug that gap is private donations and in late December CERN received a significant boost from several organizations including the Breakthrough Prize Foundation, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for Strategic Innovation, and the entrepreneurs John Elkann and Xavier Niel. Together, they pledged a total of $1bn towards the FCC-ee.</p>
<p>Costas Fountas, president of the CERN Council, says CERN is “extremely grateful” for the interest. “This once again demonstrates CERN’s relevance and positive impact on society, and the strong interest in CERN’s future that exists well beyond our own particle physics community,” he notes.</p>
<p>Eric Schmidt, who founded Google, claims that he and Wendy Schmidt were “inspired by the ambition of this project and by what it could mean for the future of humanity”. The FCC, he believes, is an instrument that “could push the boundaries of human knowledge and deepen our understanding of the fundamental laws of the Universe” and could lead to technologies that could benefit society “in profound ways” from medicine to computing to sustainable energy.</p>
<p>The cash promised has been welcomed by outgoing CERN director-general Fabiola Gianotti. “It’s the first time in history that private donors wish to partner with CERN to build an extraordinary research instrument that will allow humanity to take major steps forward in our understanding of fundamental physics and the universe,” she said. “I am profoundly grateful to them for their generosity, vision, and unwavering commitment to knowledge and exploration.”</p>
<h3>Further boost</h3>
<p>The cash comes a few months after the Circular Electron–Positron Collider (CEPC) – a rival collider to the FCC-ee that also involves building a huge 100 km tunnel to study the Higgs in unprecedented detail – was not considered for inclusion in China’s next five-year plan, which runs from 2026 to 2030. There has been much discussion in China about whether the CEPC is the right project for the country, with the collider facing criticism from particle physicist and Nobel laureate Chen-Ning Yang, before he died last year.</p>
<p>Wang Yifang of the Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) in Beijing says they will submit the CEPC for consideration again in 2030 unless FCC is officially approved before then. But for particle theorist John Ellis from Kings College London, China’s decision to effectively put the CEPC on the back burner  “certainly simplifies the FCC discussion”. “However, an opportunity for growing the world particle physics community has been lost, or at least deferred [by the decision],” Ellis told <em>Physics World</em>.</p>
<p>Ellis adds, however, that he would welcome China’s participation in the FCC. “Their accelerator and detector [technical design reviews] show that they could bring a lot to the table, if the political obstacles can be overcome,” he says. </p><article>

				<h4><p>CERN releases plans for the ‘most extraordinary instrument ever built’</p>
</h4>

<p>However, if the FCC-ee goes ahead China could perhaps make significant “in-kind” contributions rather like those that occur with the ITER experimental fusion reactor, which is currently being built in France. In this case, instead of cash payments, the countries provide components, equipment and other materials.</p>
<p>Those considerations and more will now fall to the British physicist Mark Thomson, who took over from Gianotti as CERN director-general on 1 January for a five-year term. As well as working on funding requirements for the FCC-ee, top of his in-tray will actually be shutting down the LHC in June to make way for further work on the HL-LHC, which involves installing powerful new superconducting magnets and improving the detection.</p>
<p>About 90% of the 27 km LHC accelerator will be affected by the upgrade with a major part being to replace the magnets in the final focus systems of the two large experiments, ATLAS and CMS. These magnets will take the incoming beams and then focus them down to less than 10 µm in cross section. The upgrade includes the installation of brand new state-of-the-art niobium-tin (Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn) superconducting focusing magnets.</p>
<p>The HL-LHC will probably not turn on until 2030, at which time Thomson’s term will nearly be over, but that doesn’t deter him from leading the world’s foremost particle-physics lab. “It’s an incredibly exciting project,” Thomson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/dec/31/large-hadron-collider-head-of-cern-mark-thomson">told the <em>Guardian</em></a>. “It’s more interesting than just sitting here with the machine hammering away.”</p>
