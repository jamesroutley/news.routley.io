        <p>
          If you are on a personal connection, like at home, you can run an anti-virus scan on your device to make sure it is not infected with malware.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are at an office or shared network, you can ask the network administrator to run a scan across the network looking for misconfigured or infected devices.
