We did a poor job explaining this decision, which eroded some of the valuable trust we built over the years. I want to clarify why we made these changes, who’s affected by it, and what we’ve learned over the past week.</p><p>We made the difficult decision to focus on our core: <strong>serving startups and scaled companies</strong>. We learned we couldn’t serve smaller businesses well at the same time, and focus was the only way to deliver a level of service we’re proud of.</p><h3><strong>Who will Brex continue to serve?</strong></h3><p>We didn’t clearly communicate who qualifies as a Brex customer moving forward, which created confusion about which companies Brex would still serve.</p><p>Our products are designed for companies that have or will soon reach some level of scale, and inevitably face challenges such as fast-growing headcount, global workforces or significant cash to manage. Therefore, we feel confident in delivering a best-in-class service to customers who meet any of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Received an equity investment of any amount (accelerator, angel, VC or web3 token);</li><li>More than $1 million a year in revenue;</li><li>More than 50 employees;</li><li>More than $500k in cash;</li><li>Tech startups who are on a path to meeting the criteria above, and are referred by an existing customer or partner.</li></ul><h3><strong>Why did we change who Brex can serve?</strong></h3><p>We designed Brex for companies that reach some level of scale, with a white-glove onboarding, implementation, and support experience. Our goal is to give all customers the same service that a large company receives from day one, with things such as a dedicated point of contact, 24x7 global support, and implementation help.<br/></p><p>It’s hard to make the economics of this business model work for companies that don&#39;t hit a scale threshold, and many customers asked us why we couldn’t keep smaller businesses and charge for a premium service. The answer is more complicated than costs – the needs of smaller businesses are fundamentally different. To serve smaller businesses well, we need a fully automated, one-size-fits-all product experience that doesn’t fully exist today. On the other hand, startups and scaled companies need a higher-touch experience with Brex tailored to the individual needs of their organizations.<br/></p><p>Our decision wasn’t driven by financial constraints, but by how many things we can do well at once.</p><h3><strong>Lessons learned</strong></h3><p>Last week’s announcement was an incredibly disappointing moment for Brex.
