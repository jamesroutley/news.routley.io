    <h1>Consuming Articles Offline</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>My desktop is my portal to the Internet. <a href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a> Lately, I’ve needed to
spend significant amounts of time away from my machine. So I took to
printing articles and taking them with me.</p>
<p>The experience has been transformative.</p>
<p>As an example, consider this
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/sep/16/geofence-warrants-reverse-search-warrants-police-google">article</a>:</p>
<a href="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/guard01.png"><img alt="Screenshot of the article in Google Chrome" src="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/guard01.png"/></a>
<p>And as I scroll further down:</p>
<a href="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/guard02.png"><img alt="Further down the article." src="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/guard02.png"/></a>
<p>What a mess. Look at all the ads. Let’s enable AdBlock.</p>
<a href="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/guard-adlock-01.png"><img alt="Screenshot of the article in Firefox with Adblock on" src="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/guard-adlock-01.png"/></a>
<p>And further down:</p>
<a href="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/guard-adblock-02.png"><img alt="Screenshot of the article in Firefox with Adblock on" src="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/guard-adblock-02.png"/></a>
<p>The ads are gone. This is better, right?</p>
<p>Here’s how it looks when I print it:</p>
<a href="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/printed.png"><img alt="Print View" src="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/printed.png"/></a>
<p>Putting aside the blurriness of the last one, which was an artifact of
how I took the photo, which do you prefer?</p>
<p>In the printed version:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no ads.</li>
<li>There are no distracting sidebar menus.</li>
<li>There’s no distracting menu on the top.</li>
<li>Links don’t work. I can’t distract myself by going to some other page.</li>
<li>There are no photos.</li>
<li>Oh, and although it’s not clear from my screenshot, there’s no wall
of text on the bottom asking for a donation.</li>
<li>If I want to, I can write on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s just the article. You can focus all your attention on the content easily.</p>
<p>Regarding the images that have been stripped, ask yourself: Did the
photo really contribute much to the article?</p>
<p>Incidentally, lest you think photos never get printed, the print view
tends to make fairly good decisions on which images to print and which
not to. I’ve yet to encounter an article I printed that <em>didn’t</em> print a
relevant image.</p>
<p>For example, for this
<a href="https://lunduke.substack.com/p/the-best-vga-dos-games-period">article</a>,
here is what the printed view looks like:</p>
<a href="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/print-images.png"><img alt="Printed view with images" src="http://blog.nawaz.org/images/print-articles/print-images.png"/></a>
<p>Is the absence of links a good thing? I think so. It raises the barrier
to wandering off, and if I’m <em>really</em> interested in what’s in the link,
I make a note of it and click on it the next time I’m on the computer.</p>
<p>A more interesting question to ask yourself: Why do news articles
encourage you to leave the article you are reading?</p>
<p>Only after I started doing this did I realize the filth I’d been living
in all these years. I can’t go back to reading articles via the browser
any more.</p>
<p>So I’ve changed my reading workflow. Now if an interesting article comes
my way, I immediately print and staple it, and deposit it into a
physical inbox. I then continue doing non-reading work on the computer.
When I’m in the mood for reading, I get up from my computer, pick an
article (either the one on top of the inbox or a random one), and sit
somewhere in the house and read it.</p>
<p>The incidental benefits that this system has:</p>
<p>The font in printed view is fairly decent, and I get a consistent font
regardless of the article I’m reading.</p>
<p>I am no longer tethered to the computer.</p>
<p>I often take a few articles with me and keep them in the car. If I’m
doing errands and find myself in situations where I have to wait (e.g.
doctor’s office, etc) I simply pick up articles and read them.</p>
<p>When I’m working on the computer (personal or job related), I am a lot
less likely to get distracted by articles. If I find myself starting to
read something, I go ahead and print it and put it in the inbox.</p>
<p>I used to keep lots of tabs open in my browser all the time. There would
be tabs I’d opened months ago because it contained an article I intended
to read. I no longer suffer from this.</p>
<p>I expected the pile of articles in my inbox would grow and give me a
comparable amount of stress, but somehow it has never bothered me. I
told myself if it ever came to that, I’d take a big pile of articles and
throw them in the recycle box (conveniently located near it). So far,
this has never happened.</p>
<p>I don’t really recall what I’ve put into the inbox, so I can’t
experience any angst over “that article I really want to make sure I
read one day”.</p>
<p>And of course, no eye strain.</p>
<p>The down side? Not the most environmentally friendly. I print on both
sides of the paper, and 2 pages per side, so I get 4 pages per sheet of
paper. So a 16 page article uses only 4 sheets. The font may seem small,
but I’ve not had issues with the size. Still, if printing paper bothers
you, read the section about Ereaders below.</p>
<p>Here is how I make the prints using Firefox.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on reader view in the location bar (next to the star on the right).</li>
<li>Go to the print dialog.</li>
<li>Select Portrait orientation.</li>
<li>Set 2 pages per sheet.</li>
<li>For two sided printing, flip on short edge.</li>
</ol>
<p>Occasionally you may need to adjust the scaling. I find I have to do
110-120% for Wikipedia articles, for example.</p>
<p>Some sites - Medium in particular - are hostile to printing. For that,
use the <a href="https://www.printfriendly.com/">Print Friendly</a> extension.</p>
<div id="what-about-ereaders">
<h2>What About Ereaders?</h2>
<p>Ereaders can be great. In fact, 10 years ago I consumed articles using
the “Fetch News” feature of <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/">Calibre</a>. It
takes a bit of tweaking per feed, but it was great. As an example, for
news sites you can pass in the <span>RSS</span> feed and have it produce an epub with
all the day’s news - once a day. You then sync with your ereader. It
feels very much like reading a physical newspaper.</p>
<p>I did this for a year or two. The convenience was similar: I used to
carry my ereader around with me, and there is no eye strain. Why did I
stop? The size of the display, and the lack of crispness in the
resolution. Once I can afford an ereader that’s comparable in size as
letter/A4 paper, with at least 300 dpi, I may revert to this approach.</p>
