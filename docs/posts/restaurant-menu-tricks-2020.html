Far from being glorified pricelists, restaurant menus are sophisticated marketing tools that can nudge customers towards certain choices. Restaurant menus can even tell us what to think.<!-- --></p><p>“Even the binding around the menu is passing us important messages about the kind of experience we are about to have,” explains Charles Spence, a professor in experimental psychology and multisensory perception at the University of Oxford. “There are a lot of elements on a menu that can be changed to nudge the customer in one way or another.”<!-- --></p><p>Even simple tweaks to the order of items on the menu or the typeface used can have a significant impact on people’s choices. There is now an entire industry known as “menu engineering”, dedicated to designing menus that convey certain messages to customers, encouraging them to spend more and make them want to come back for a second helping.<!-- --></p><p>“For a large chain that might have a million people a day coming into their restaurants around the world, it can take up to 18 months to put out a menu as we test everything on it three times,” says Gregg Rapp, <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.menuengineers.com/">a menu engineer<!-- --></a> based in Palm Springs, California, who has worked on menus for small neighbourhood cafes and multinational giants during his 34-year-long career. “Customers only spend a few minutes looking at the menu, so we want them to use this time efficiently. If they can find an item they want quickly, then they can spend the extra time looking at other items they might order.”<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://organicdonut.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p05nlqvb.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p05nlqvb.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p05nlqvb.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p05nlqvb.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p05nlqvb.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p05nlqvb.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p05nlqvb.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p05nlqvb.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p05nlqvb.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p05nlqvb.jpg.webp" alt="Alamy Using prosaic terms to emphasise the provenance of food can makes dishes seem cheaper than they are (Credit: Alamy)"/><span>Alamy</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Using prosaic terms to emphasise the provenance of food can makes dishes seem cheaper than they are (Credit: Alamy)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p><b id="a-sweet-type">A sweet type<!-- --></b></p><p>The font the menu is written in can convey similar messages; for instance an <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278431915001711">italic typeface conveys a perception of quality<!-- --></a>.

Sensory words can also make a dish seem more appealing.”<!-- --></p><p>A recent study published by scientists at Stanford University, in California, found that vegetables that have been given indulgent sounding descriptions – such as “dynamite chili”, “sweet sizzling green beans”, and “crispy shallots” – on a cafeteria menu <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://mbl.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/turnwaldbolescrum_indulgentdescriptionsandvegetableconsumption.pdf">were picked 23% more often<!-- --></a> because it made them sound more exciting and flavoursome.<!-- --></p><div data-component="quote-block"><div><p><span>The more description you have the higher the value of the item and the lower the price seems in the customer&#39;s head &amp;ndash; Gregg Rapp, menu engineer</span></p></div></div><p>The words used to describe a food, however, may do far more than make them sound enticing – they can make our mouths water.

The story behind the food has to be personal and true.”<!-- --></p><p>But the words on the menu are not the only thing sending you signals. The colours it uses could also be having an impact.

Red suggests a sense of urgency and perhaps draws attention to dishes the chef most wants you to buy – probably because they have the biggest profit margin.<!-- --></p><p>Restaurants can use other tricks though to tempt diners into buying more expensive dishes. Perhaps the most common is to drop the price by a cent (or penny), as paying $5.99 for a dish makes it seem cheaper than a nice round $6. This is widely used across the retail industry and most consumers are wise to it. But restaurants have another trick up their sleeve – dropping the dollar or pound sign altogether.<!-- --></p><p>“The dollar sign is a pain point that reminds the diner that they are spending money,” says Allen. “By just using the figure, or even better, writing it out in words, it can reduce that pain.”<!-- --></p><p><b id="prime-real-estate">Prime real estate<!-- --></b></p><p>Allen even says simply reordering the dishes on the menu can also have dramatic impacts. By placing the most expensive item at the top of the menu, it makes those that come after it seem far more reasonably priced.<!-- --></p><p>“We can increase the profits of a restaurant by thousands simply by rearranging the items on the menu,” says Allen.<!-- --></p><div data-component="quote-block"><div><p><span>Filling a menu with too many items can actually hamper choice</span></p></div></div><p>Research using eye-tracking technology has shown that customers read menus in very predictable ways. They will often <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-02/sfsu-dm013112.php">read a menu much like they would a book<!-- --></a>, but Rapp’s own work has shown there are some hotspots on the page.<!-- --></p><p>“When we do eye tracking on a customer with a menu in their hand, we typically see hotspots in the upper right hand side,” he says. “The first item on the menu is also the best real estate.”<!-- --></p><p>Some large restaurant chains are even <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.restaurant.org/Downloads/PDFs/BigData">using big data <!-- --></a>from hundreds of thousands of sales to see what impact moving something on a menu can have.<!-- --></p><p>But filling a menu with too many items can actually hamper choice, according to menu design experts. They say offering any more than seven items can overwhelm diners. To overcome this, they tell restaurants to break down their menus into sections of between five and seven dishes.<!-- --></p><p>“More than seven is too many, five is optimal and three is magical,” says Rapp. There is some research to back this up – a <!-- --><a target="_blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263451672_Menu_Choice_Satisfaction_or_Overload">study from Bournemouth University<!-- --></a> a few years ago found that in fast food restaurants, customers wanted to pick from six items per category. In fine dining establishments, they preferred a little more choice – between seven and 10 items.<!-- --></p><p><b id="picture-this">Picture this<!-- --></b></p><p>There are other ways menus can draw your attention to particular dishes, rather than relying upon the path your roving eye takes. Boxes around certain dishes – often high-priced options like steaks – can be particularly effective.<!-- --></p><p>Some restaurants also use logos that might signify a new time or a seasonal dish to draw a customer towards those choices. Images can also help, but it depends on where you are eating. In many parts of the world, pictures of food tend to be associated with cheaper fast food, and can put off the more snobby eater.<!-- --></p><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://organicdonut.com/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p05nlyg1.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p05nlyg1.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p05nlyg1.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p05nlyg1.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p05nlyg1.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p05nlyg1.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p05nlyg1.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p05nlyg1.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p05nlyg1.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p05nlyg1.jpg.webp" alt="Alamy Oozing protein - like melted cheese - has a particularly powerful effect on us (Credit: Alamy)"/><span>Alamy</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Oozing protein - like melted cheese - has a particularly powerful effect on us (Credit: Alamy)<!-- --></figcaption></p></figure><p>“The problem with pictures is that the brain will also taste the food a little bit when it sees a picture, so when the food comes it may not be quite as good as they imagined,” warns Rapp. “Often the food doesn’t come out looking as good as it does in the pictures too.”<!-- --></p><p>That is a common problem that anyone who has eaten in certain fast food burger restaurants will have experienced.
