</div><p>Researchers may have solved Professor Stephen Hawking&#39;s famous black hole paradox—a mystery that has puzzled scientists for almost half a century.

                                                                                    <p>According to two new studies, something called &#34;quantum hair&#34; is the answer to the problem.</p>
<p>In the first paper, published in the journal <i>Physical Review Letters</i>, researchers demonstrated that <a href="https://phys.org/tags/black+holes/" rel="tag">black holes</a> are more complex than originally thought and have gravitational fields that hold information about how they were formed.</p>
<p>The researchers showed that matter collapsing into a black hole leaves a mark in its <a href="https://phys.org/tags/gravitational+field/" rel="tag">gravitational field</a>—an imprint referred to as a &#34;quantum hair.&#34;</p>
<p>In a follow-up paper, published in a separate journal, <i>Physics Letters B</i>, Professor Xavier Calmet from the University of Sussex&#39;s School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences and Professor Stephen Hsu from Michigan State University said quantum hairs resolve Hawking&#39;s Black Hole Information Paradox.</p>
<p>In 1976, Hawking suggested that, as black holes evaporate, they destroy information about what had formed them.</p>
<p>That idea goes against a fundamental law of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/quantum+mechanics/" rel="tag">quantum mechanics</a> which states any process in physics can be mathematically reversed.</p>
<p>In the 1960s, physicist John Archibald Wheeler, discussing black holes&#39; lack of observable features beyond their total mass, spin, and charge, coined the phrase &#34;black holes have no hair&#34;—known as the no-hair theorem.</p>
<p>However, the newly discovered &#34;quantum hair&#34; provides a way for information to be preserved as a black hole collapses and, as such, resolves one of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/modern+science/" rel="tag">modern science</a>&#39;s most famous quandaries, experts say.</p>
<p>Prof Calmet said: &#34;Black holes have long been considered the perfect laboratory to study how to merge Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>&#34;It was generally assumed within the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+community/" rel="tag">scientific community</a> that resolving this paradox would require a huge paradigm shift in physics, forcing the potential reformulation of either quantum mechanics or general relativity.</p>
<p>&#34;What we found—and I think is particularly exciting—is that this isn&#39;t necessary.&#34;</p>
<p>Explaining the discovery of the &#34;quantum hair,&#34; Roberto Casadio, professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Bologna, said: &#34;A crucial aspect is that black holes are formed by the collapse of compact objects and then, according to the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/quantum+theory/" rel="tag">quantum theory</a>, there is no absolute separation between the interior and the exterior of the black hole.</p>
<p>&#34;In the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/classical+theory/" rel="tag">classical theory</a>, the horizon acts as a perfect one-way membrane which does not let anything out and the exterior is therefore the same for all black holes of a given mass. This is the classical no-hair theorem,&#34; Casadio added. </p>
<p>&#34;However, in the quantum theory, the state of the matter that collapses and forms the black hole continues to affect the state of the exterior, albeit in a way that is compatible with present experimental bounds. This is what is known as &#39;quantum hair.&#39;&#34;
