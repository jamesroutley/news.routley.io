<p dir="auto">Fine-tune Llama2 and CodeLLama models, including 70B/35B on Apple M1/M2 devices (for example, Macbook Air or Mac Mini) or consumer nVidia GPUs.</p>
<p dir="auto">slowllama is not using any quantization. Instead, it offloads parts of model to SSD or main memory on both forward/backward passes. In contrast with training large models from scratch (unattainable) or inference, where we are likely to care about interactivity, we can still get something finetuned if you let it run for a while.</p>
<p dir="auto">Current version is using LoRA to limit the updates to a smaller set of parameters. First version supported full finetuning as well, but I decided to remove it for now, more on that below.</p>
<p dir="auto">Finetuning is the only focus, there&#39;s nothing special done for inference, consider <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp">llama.cpp</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For CUDA-specific experiments, see <a href="https://jvns.ca/okuvshynov/slowllama/blob/main/docs/a10.md">report on a10</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is all very experimental, but even more so for CUDA.</p>

<p dir="auto">Tests were done on Apple M1 with 16Gb memory and Apple M2 with 24Gb memory.</p>
<p dir="auto">In order to fine-tune llama2 model we need to:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Install dependencies: <code>pip install torch sentencepiece numpy</code>. Optional: install <code>pip install fewlines</code> for <a href="https://jvns.ca/okuvshynov/slowllama/blob/main/docs/lora_weights.md">weight/gradient distribution logging</a>.</li>
<li>Clone <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama">llama2</a> and follow instructions to download the models. The script will download tokenizer as well. <code>tokenizer.model</code> should be put into the same directory as llama model itself. Use <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/codellama">codellama</a> for CodeLLama models. Example folder structure could look like:</li>

<p dir="auto">Let&#39;s start with a <a href="https://jvns.ca/okuvshynov/slowllama/blob/main/test_data/cubestat.txt">tiny example</a>. It is an intro to the description of another open-source project - <a href="https://github.com/okuvshynov/cubestat">cubestat</a>. Text is short enough to just be included as part of the prompt, but it&#39;s ok as an illustration and you can read it in seconds youself. As I just published that project recently, there&#39;s no way original llama would know anything about it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Asking base llama2-7b to complete the prompt <em>&#34;Cubestat reports the following metrics: &#34;</em> results in <em>&#34;1) the number of cubes in the system, 2) the number of cubes that are in the process of being created&#34;</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">First step is to transform the model to the sequential format more suitable for loading to/from storage block-by-block.</p>

<p dir="auto">Modify the input/output paths in the script itself.</p>
<p dir="auto">Now we can try not-finetuned llama2:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python test_gen.py ../llama7b mps # use path to transformed model here"><pre><code>python test_gen.py ../llama7b mps # use path to transformed model here
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Now let&#39;s finetune the 7b model. <a href="https://jvns.ca/okuvshynov/slowllama/blob/main/finetune.py">finetune.py</a> is a very simple script which trains LoRA weights based on the plaintext data. There are some settings you could change here, like sequence length, batch size, learning rate, dropout rate, number of iterations. Current settings are pretty much a guess, change this if desired. Adjust accordingly. Currently it uses AdamW optimizer.</p>

<p dir="auto">For all versions the process is roughly the same.</p>
<p dir="auto">First, we need to be able to load a model which requires more RAM than we have and save it back in sequential format. We create model instance with all large modules&#39; weights offloaded to SSD - all of the transformer blocks, token embeddings and output linear layer. After that we <a href="https://github.com/okuvshynov/slowllama/blob/main/loader.py#L69">load model shards one by one</a>, for each shard iterate over all modules, update corresponding subset of its weights and save it back.</p>
<p dir="auto">Doing forward path is easy - we just load modules when we need and pass the output forward.</p>
<p dir="auto">Backward pass is a little more tricky, in a way we have to run forward pass twice. The way it&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/okuvshynov/slowllama/blob/main/blackbox_model.py#L351">currently implemented</a> is:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Do a forward pass while also saving inputs to each offloaded block to the SSD. The goal of the first forward pass is to compute the final loss and cache inputs to each offloaded block.</li>
<li>Then, do a manual backward gradient propagation. We start from the last block, re-run each block once again (forward, to build autograd graph) with the same input we cached on step (1). After that we run backward pass within that block only, and pass the gradient for the input to the next (previous?) block. As we use LoRA, only LoRA gradients are being saved. LoRA weights are not offloaded to disk, always staying on RAM/GPU. Important: we also need to save and restore random number generation state before evaluating each offloaded module. During training we use dropout, and randomly switched off neurons should be the same on both forward passes.</li>
<li>After that we run optimizer step on LoRA weights and save them separately if needed.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Original llama2 weights are in bfloat16, but mps backend doesn&#39;t support that type natively, so we do computation in float32 instead.</p>
<p dir="auto">Experimental version of slowllama which can be still found <a href="https://github.com/okuvshynov/experiments/tree/5cf944cb1274e577d1e755e6ad1957190d286d9d/split_model">here</a> was capable of doing full finetuning and update all weights pretty much the same way. I&#39;ve temporarily removed that feature to preserve the lifespan of SSDs, as frequent write operations can degrade performance over time. Reading from SSDs isn&#39;t an issue, but they do have a write limit. Limit is typically high enough for normal usage, but in the case of full finetunining we&#39;ll have to write ~150Gb per one iteration/weight update of 70B variant, assuming stateless optimizer and no gradient accumulation. With AdamW we&#39;ll have to save/update another 150Gb more of optimizer state per iteration. If, for example, we assume 1Pb of writes before SSD will start having issues, even 100 iterations of finetuning would incur significant cost/risk. For machines with GPUs and large amount of RAM we can skip the disk entirely and offload to RAM only. It should be possible to bring full finetuning back for main-memory-only offload. On the other hand, if everything fits into memory, there&#39;s no need to do whole &#39;evaluate twice&#39; thing, might just use <a href="https://fairscale.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deep_dive/offload.html" rel="nofollow">fairscale</a> instead and only move tensors between GPU/CPU.</p>

<p dir="auto">Here we can see resource utilization for 1 full iteration on 7B model - forward and manual backward passes. Each column == 1 second. A few notes:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>GPU is reasonably well utilized;</li>
<li>First forward pass has lower GPU utilization and spends more time on IO as we need to both read weights and write cached inputs/outputs</li>
<li>Backward (combined?) pass achieves very high GPU utilization, close to 100%</li>
<li>As we move along layers back and forth, right after each &#39;direction switch&#39; we process layers in LIFO order. Thus in the beginning of both forward and backward pass we don&#39;t have to access disk, weights are being cached and we don&#39;t see disk reads.</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">The chart here has different granularity - each column is 30 seconds. Input data was also different - it is the readme file you are reading now.
I didn&#39;t have enough free space on disk to store both original weights (140Gb) + weights in sequential format we use (another 140Gb). In order to still be able to finetune this model, I stored original weights on much slower external SD card, as we need to read them only once. Weights in sequential format on fast internal SSD.
With batch size = 16 and sequence length = 128 it was taking ~25-30 min per iteration.</p>
<p dir="auto">As we can see, GPU utilization doesn&#39;t look that great - we might be able to benefit from prefetching next transformer block, assuming we have enough memory for storing 2 layers. Memory utilization peaked at around 80% of 16Gb.</p>
