<u>Synopsis:</u> <strong>
 A transition from ENSO-neutral is expected in the next couple of months, with a greater than 90% chance of El Niño persisting into the Northern Hemisphere winter.

															   <p>During April, above-average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) expanded slightly westward to the east-central equatorial Pacific Ocean <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/figure01.gif">[Fig. 1]</a>. The latest weekly Niño-3.4 index value was +0.4°C, with the easternmost Niño-3 and Niño1+2 regions at +0.8°C and +2.7°C, respectively <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/figure02.gif">[Fig. 2]</a>. Area-averaged subsurface temperatures anomalies continued to increase <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/figure03.gif">[Fig. 3]</a>, reflecting widespread positive temperature anomalies below the surface of the equatorial Pacific Ocean <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/figure04.gif">[Fig. 4]</a>. Low-level wind anomalies were westerly during mid-April before switching back to easterly by the end of the month. Upper-level wind anomalies were westerly across most of the Pacific Ocean. Suppressed convection was observed over parts of Indonesia and anomalies weakened near the Date Line <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/figure05.gif">[Fig. 5]</a>. While the warming near coastal South America remains striking, the basin-wide coupled ocean-atmosphere system remained consistent with ENSO-neutral.</p>
<p>The most recent IRI plume also indicates El Niño is likely to form during the May-July season and persist into the winter <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/figure06.gif">[Fig. 6]</a>. The combination of a forecasted third westerly wind event in mid-late May, and high levels of above-average oceanic heat content, means that a potentially significant El Niño is on the horizon. While at least a weak El Niño is likely, the <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/strengths/index.php">range of possibilities</a> at the end of the year (November-January) include a 80% chance of at least a moderate El Niño (Niño-3.4 ≥ 1.0°C) to a ~55% chance of a strong El Niño (Niño-3.4 ≥ 1.5°C). It is still possible the tropical atmosphere does not couple with the ocean, and El Niño fails to materialize (5-10% chance). In summary, a transition from ENSO-neutral is expected in the next couple of months, with a greater than 90% chance of El Niño persisting into the Northern Hemisphere winter <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/figure07.gif">[Fig. 7]</a>.</p>

															          This discussion is a consolidated effort of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), NOAA&#39;s National Weather Service, and their funded institutions. Oceanic and atmospheric conditions are updated weekly on the Climate Prediction Center web site (<a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/MJO/enso.shtml" title="Weekly ENSO Update page">El Niño/La Niña Current Conditions and Expert Discussions</a>). Additional perspectives and analysis are also available in an <a href="http://www.climate.gov/news-features/blogs/enso/">ENSO blog</a>. A probabilistic strength forecast is <a href="https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/strengths/index.php">available here</a>. The next ENSO Diagnostics Discussion is scheduled for 8 June 2023.  </p>
