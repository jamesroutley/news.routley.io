    <h1>Sun Microsystems co-founder charged with insider trading</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A Silicon Valley heavyweight has been charged with insider trading by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Andreas &#34;Andy&#34; Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems and an early Google investor, is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-40" rel="nofollow">accused</a> of using his knowledge of Cisco&#39;s 2019 acquisition of Acacia Communications to buy options in Acacia using the accounts of a close relative and associate.</p>
<p>Andy Bechtolsheim, who was at the time chair of Arista Networks, a datacenter networking firm he co-founded, was aware of the deal because he had been consulted on it by &#34;another multinational technology company&#34; that had also been considering acquiring Acacia, the SEC says.</p>

    

<p>According to the SEC&#39;s <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2024/comp-pr2024-40.pdf">complaint</a>, the manager at the unnamed company that was considering acquiring Acacia texted Bechtolsheim that he &#34;needed to chat rather urgently regarding a possible transaction in the optics space.&#34;</p>

        


        

<p>The SEC alleges Bechtolsheim &#34;immediately&#34; acquired Acacia option contracts when learning of the pending purchase by Cisco, which earned him $415,726 in profit when markets opened and Acacia shares rose 35 percent on news of the purchase.</p>

</ul>
<p>The complaint alleges that Bechtolsheim &#34;knew or was reckless in not knowing&#34; that the information he was given was non-public, and that he had a duty to keep that information confidential.</p>
<p>&#34;We allege that Bechtolsheim, while serving as the chairman of a publicly traded company, abused the trust of a longtime business contact who had shared highly sensitive information about an imminent corporate acquisition,&#34; said SEC market abuse unit chief Joseph G Sansone.</p>
<p>Bechtolsheim has agreed to pay a civil penalty of $923,740 for earning slightly more than half that for his illegal trades, and has also agreed to be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years.</p>

        

<p>Forbes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/andreas-von-bechtolsheim/" rel="nofollow">lists</a> Bechtolsheim&#39;s net worth at somewhere north of $16 billion. The SEC fine is less than 0.006 percent of his holdings. Â®</p>
