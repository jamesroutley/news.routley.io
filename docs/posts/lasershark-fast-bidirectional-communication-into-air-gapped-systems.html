<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Physical isolation, so called air-gapping, is an effective method for
protecting security-critical computers and networks. While it might be
possible to introduce malicious code through the supply chain, insider
attacks, or social engineering, communicating with the outside world is
prevented. Different approaches to breach this essential line of defense
have been developed based on electro- magnetic, acoustic, and optical
communication channels. However, all of these approaches are limited in
either data rate or distance, and frequently offer only exfiltration of
data. We present a novel approach to infiltrate data to air-gapped
systems without any additional hardware on-site. By aiming lasers at
already built-in LEDs and recording their response, we are the first to
enable a long-distance (25 m), bidirectional, and fast (18.2 kbps in
&amp; 100 kbps out) covert communication channel. The approach can be
used against any office device that operates LEDs at the CPU’s GPIO
interface.</p>

<h2>Proof-of-Concept Implementations</h2>

<p>To foster future research and push forward defenses against covert
channels, we make all code used during the experiments, raw data of the
hardware measurements, and scripts to plot them available in the
repository at:</p>

<h2>Video</h2>


<p>
The following video shows a <strong>simplified setup</strong> of the
attack as descriped
<a href="https://github.com/intellisec/lasershark/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md" target="_blank">here</a>
that can be easily re-built at home with low-cost devices rather than
strong lasers and a high-precision telescope as used for the real attack.
