The bank <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/10/silicon-valley-bank-chief-risk-officer/?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">reportedly</a> did not have a chief risk officer in the months leading up to the collapse, while more than <a href="https://twitter.com/business/status/1634211584657571843?s=20&amp;ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">90% of its deposits</a> were not insured.</p><p>In 2015, SVB President Greg Becker <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-114shrg94375/pdf/CHRG-114shrg94375.pdf?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">submitted a statement to a Senate panel</a> pushing legislators to exempt more banks – including his own – from new regulations passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Despite warnings from some senators, Becker’s lobbying effort was ultimately successful.</p><p>Touting “SVB’s deep understanding of the markets it serves, our strong risk management practices”, Becker argued that his bank would soon reach $50bn in assets, which under the law would trigger “enhanced prudential standards”, including more stringent regulations, stress tests and capital requirements for his and other similarly sized banks.</p><p>In his testimony, Becker insisted that $250bn was a more appropriate threshold.</p><p>“Without such changes, SVB likely will need to divert significant resources from providing financing to job-creating companies in the innovation economy to complying with enhanced prudential standards and other requirements,” said Becker, who <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/svb-financial-stock-sale-ceo-greg-becker-f5089a4d?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">reportedly</a> sold $3.6m of his own stock two weeks ago, in the lead-up to the bank’s collapse. “Given the low risk profile of our activities and business model, such a result would stifle our ability to provide credit to our clients without any meaningful corresponding reduction in risk.”</p><p>Two months later, SVB <a href="https://www.svb.com/news/company-news/svb-financial-group-appoints-mary-john-miller-formerly-of-the-u.s.-treasury-department-to-its-board-of-directors?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">added</a> the former Obama treasury department official Mary Miller to its board, noting she had previously helped oversee “financial regulatory reforms”.</p><figure id="61d7d276-3d19-4888-ae0f-e85f44785fd5" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:10,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/10/european-markets-spooked-by-us-bank-shares-sell-off&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Silicon Valley Bank fails in largest bank collapse since 2008 crisis&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;61d7d276-3d19-4888-ae0f-e85f44785fd5&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:0}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-10 | 10" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>Around that time, <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/40f1aec7-9dbf-46da-a20e-2ce2f5af80cc/print/?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">federal</a> <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/1a82c199-21a1-447c-98ca-78decd6cc97e/print/?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">disclosure</a> <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/e5be3075-8267-42a0-8aa2-aa1725d4e7d4/print/?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">records</a> <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/276fe661-9582-4f96-995d-151d133db5e2/print/?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">show</a> the bank was lobbying lawmakers on “financial regulatory reform” and the Systemic Risk Designation Improvement Act of 2015 – a bill that was the precursor to <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/2155/text?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">legislation</a> ultimately signed by President Donald Trump that increased the regulatory threshold for stronger stress tests to $250bn.</p><p>Trump signed the bill despite a <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2018/3/dodd-frank-roll-back-bill-a-windfall-for-big-banks?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">report</a> from Democrats on Congress’s joint economic committee warning that under the new law, SVB and other banks of its size “would no longer be subject to nearly any enhanced regulations”.</p><p>The bill was supported in the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1152/vote_115_2_00054.htm?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">Senate</a> by 50 Republicans and 17 Democrats, including the Democratic Virginia Senator Mark Warner, for whom Becker held a fundraiser at his Menlo Park, California, home in 2016, according to an <a href="http://politicalpartytime.org/party/41385/?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">invitation</a> obtained by the Sunlight Foundation and OpenSecrets. The bank’s political action committee also donated a total of $10,000 to Warner’s campaigns in the <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/silicon-valley-bank/C00333658/candidate-recipients/2016?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">2016</a> and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/silicon-valley-bank/C00333658/candidate-recipients/2018?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">2018</a> election cycles.</p><p>In 2019, when the Federal Reserve proposed regulations implementing the deregulatory law, financial watchdogs warned that its regulations on Category IV institutions – as <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45711?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">SVB was later classified</a> due to its size and other risk factors – were far too weak.</p><p>“The proposal to significantly weaken enhanced prudential standards for Category IV firms could be disastrous,” Better Markets, a non-profit advocating for stricter financial regulations, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/SECRS/2019/August/20190806/R-1658/R-1658_062119_134209_447374886406_1.pdf?ref=the-lever" data-link-name="in body link">wrote</a> in a comment on the Federal Reserve’s proposal. “Moreover, these are not small or insignificant firms.
