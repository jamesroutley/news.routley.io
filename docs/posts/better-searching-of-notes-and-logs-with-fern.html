    <h1>Better Searching of Notes and Logs with Fern</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"><p><span><a href="https://bugwhisperer.dev/tags/fern">fern</a></span> <span><a href="https://bugwhisperer.dev/tags/cli">cli</a></span> <span><a href="https://bugwhisperer.dev/tags/knowledge-management">knowledge-management</a></span></p><p>There’s been a lot of changes happening for Fern, the notetaking CLI app, since I <a href="https://bugwhisperer.dev/blog/fern-cli-v1-3-0-release-notes/">wrote about it last</a>!</p><p>Most notably with v0.2.0, is the new, global search command <code>fern find &#34;&lt;search term&gt;&#34;</code>. Designed for when you have no freakin’ clue where you wrote down something and want to search everything. It allows you to quickly search through BOTH your journal logs and notes at once. Plus, <code>fern find</code> also has <code>-j</code> and <code>-n</code> flags to narrow down it’s search range to journals or notes respectively. The old <code>fern journal|note find &#34;&lt;search term&gt;&#34;</code> commands will still work, they’re just longer to type. “Doesn’t this make the old way redundent,” I hear you ask. Yes. Will the old ones be removed? I dunno. It’s not hurting anyone having two ways to find things for now. I’ll let user feedback drive that.</p><p>Next big change is that Fern now has an interactive <code>find</code> UX! Whereas before users would see a simple dump of files that had hits for their search phrase, now they will see a paginated list of files and a prompt to either enter a number to open that file OR use ‘p|n’ to navigate to the previous or next pages respectively. Lastly, users can hit ‘q’ to abort the picking process. Here’s an example of what you can expect now:</p><pre><code><span>Found 5 matching files:
</span><span>
</span><span> 1) /journals/2023/2023-11-13.md
</span><span> 2) /journals/2023/2023-11-21.md
</span><span> 3) /journals/2025/01/2025-01-07.md
</span><span> 4) /journals/2025/06/wk24.log
</span><span> 5) /notes/School Application.md
</span><span>
</span><span>Enter the number of the file to open (1-5), or &#39;q&#39; to quit:
</span></code></pre><p>No more searching for something, only to have to copy an paste a file path to open it. :)</p><p>Lastly, while I have <del>you captive</del> your attention, I’ll quickly drop what I think are some of the other noteworthy features that were added to Fern in past releases:</p><ol><li>Switched over to using a Makefile for installation management in v0.1.7. Just run <code>make install</code> and you’re off!</li><li>Bash/Fish/ZSH shell tab completion was added in, split up over v0.1.6 and v0.1.8 releases. It was a small thing, but it’s made daily use of fern sooooo much more smooth and painless.</li></ol><p>That’s everything for now! I’ll keep this short. Thanks for reading! :) As always if you have any suggestions or issues, drop me message on Mastodon or make an issue on GitHub or SourceHut.</p></div></div>
