                    <p>TL;DR</p>
<p>Today, we’re announcing a free early preview of CLion, which uses the ReSharper C++/Rider C++ language engine instead of the CLion &#34;legacy&#34; engine. The Preview build is available via our dedicated Toolbox App feed. At some point in 2024, depending on the results of the feedback collected, CLion Nova will be merged into CLion. Until then, the Preview build will be free to use and can be installed in parallel with your usual CLion (Classic) installation.</p>

<h2 id="prehistory">Prehistory</h2>
<p>The first C++ engine by JetBrains was designed for AppCode, our IDE for iOS and macOS developers. It was part of the IntelliJ Platform, initially written in Java and later also in Kotlin. The approach and the architecture of the engine serve many languages in IntelliJ-based IDEs well; however, this design turned out not to be the best fit for the C++ language specifically.</p>
<p>To more quickly align with the evolution of C++ and to separate the engine and IDE processes, a clangd-based engine was later added to CLion. Built on our custom branch of clangd, this engine detects any warnings and errors, shows them in the editor, and suggests quick-fixes, as well as performing highlighting, completion, and certain navigation actions. It’s also used for things like <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/clion/2023/11/striving-for-better-cpp-code-part-i-data-flow-analysis-basics/">data flow analysis</a> and MISRA checks. Meanwhile, CLion’s “legacy” engine is responsible for other code insight features like refactorings. You can see a detailed “list of responsibilities” in our <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/c-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLion documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Clangd has many advantages, but it isn’t very helpful when it comes to project-wide refactorings and actions. We prototyped a clangd-based indexer and even implemented an experimental <em>Find Usages</em> on top of it, which you can <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/find-highlight-usages.html#usages-clangdindexer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enable and evaluate in </a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/find-highlight-usages.html#usages-clangdindexer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CLion</a>.</p>
<p>Another alternative developed by JetBrains for C++ is the language engine used in ReSharper C++ and Rider (for game development in C++). There is also a communication protocol in place that makes it possible for an IntelliJ-based IDE like Rider to communicate with the stand-alone backend process serving as a language engine. We have now adapted this protocol and the original engine to CLion as well!</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>In this new and experimental solution, we’re focused on the responsiveness, accuracy, and performance of the IDE. There are two main goals we have in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addressing the long-standing <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>quality</strong> issues of CLion caused by the usage of the “legacy” engine.</li>
<li>Unifying the user experience across all of our C++ tools, i.e. CLion, Rider, and ReSharper C++.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="CLion Nova About" width="531" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/about.png"/></p>
<p>We named our new experimental preview <strong>CLion Nova,</strong> and the current version of CLion is now <strong>CLion Classic</strong>. In the future, we plan for CLion Nova to be merged into CLion Classic. No new product is envisaged.</p>
<h2 id="benefits_and_enhancements">Benefits and enhancements</h2>
<p>CLion Nova still uses two C++ language engines: a clangd-based one and the one used by ReSharper C++/Rider. Most of the features of CLion Classic should work exactly the same in CLion Nova.</p>
<p>The most notable benefits in terms of performance in CLion Nova are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster highlighting speeds, especially in the case of incremental code updates</li>
<li>A more responsive UI</li>
<li>Faster <em>Find Usages</em></li>
<li>Significantly fewer freezes and hangs in refactorings</li>
<li>Faster test indexing</li>
</ul>
<p>This unification also brings some new functions to CLion Nova that aren’t included in CLion Classic’s feature set:</p>
<ul>
<li>New refactorings like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#intro_field" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce field</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#namespace_alias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce namespace alias</a>, <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#using_enum" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduce using enumeration</a>, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Refactorings_for_CPP.html#convert_to_scoped" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convert to scoped enumeration</a>.</li>
<li>New inspections, quick-fixes, and intentions like redundant qualifier, the replace <code>auto</code> with explicit type declaration, and <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sorting of </a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>#include</code></a><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Code_Style_Assistance_in_CPP.html#sort_includes" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> directives</a>.</li>
<li>New code hints like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Settings_Inlay_Hints_CPP_Other.html#preprocessor-directive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preprocessor directive hints</a>﻿ and a <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/resharper/Inline_Parameter_Name_Hints.html#push-to-hint-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Push-to-Hint mode</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Sorting includes" width="600" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sort_includes.png"/></p>
<h2 id="notable_differences">Notable differences</h2>
<p>Unlike CLion Classic, CLion Nova doesn’t use <strong>clangd</strong> for core IDE features like code completion or highlighting. However, the JetBrains’ clangd fork is still running alongside the new engine for various tasks (ClangFormat, Clang-Tidy, MISRA checks, data flow analysis, etc.).</p>
<p>There are a few things that will look and feel new to CLion Classic users when they start using CLion Nova:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the ways the IDE reacts when the user is typing are different.</li>
<li>Some UI elements and settings related to code insight features might look unusual or be found in unfamiliar locations.</li>
<li>Some code-related settings might have different default values in CLion Nova. On the first launch, CLion Nova will migrate some of your per-project and per-application settings from CLion Classic, but not all of them.</li>
<li>Switching between different language configurations (i.e. Debug/Release) might require more time for the code insight engine to catch up. There is also no option to switch resolve context per file.</li>
<li>ReSharper C++ is Windows-only, while Rider is cross-platform. Still, the ReSharper C++/Rider engine might not support non-Windows environments as seamlessly as a Windows one. It’s worth reporting such cases to us if you come across them.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" alt="Type conversion hints settings" width="912" src="https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/type_conversion_hints.png"/></p>
<p>There’s also a list of currently missing functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toolchains</strong>: Several options exist to set up <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/2023.3/remote-development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remote work</a> in CLion. Remote work with local sources is supported in CLion Nova, while remote work with a thin client (Gateway) is not yet available.</li>
<li><strong>Languages</strong>: Objective-C language, CUDA (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/RSCPP-613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RSCPP-613</a>, <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-26144" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-26144</a>), and some vendor-specific compiler extensions aren’t yet supported.</li>
<li>Some intentions and quick-fixes like <em>Simplify statement</em> are not supported at present (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35879</a>).</li>
<li>Some less popular refactorings are also missing. We plan to reintroduce the <em>Move</em> (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35867" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35867</a>) and <em>Inline Parameter</em> refactorings (<a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/CPP-35868" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CPP-35868</a>) at a later date.</li>
<li>JetBrains’ AI Assistant is not yet available for CLion Nova.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how_to_install_clion_nova">How to install CLion Nova</h2>
<p>CLion Nova is a free early preview build available only via the <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Toolbox App</a>:</p>
