          <p>Google&#39;s oldest smart thermostats have an expiration date. The company has announced that the first and second generation Nest Learning Thermostats will lose support in October 2025, disabling most of the connected features. Google is offering some compensation for anyone still using these devices, but there&#39;s no Google upgrade for European users. Google is also discontinuing its only European model, and it&#39;s not planning to release another.</p>
<p>Both affected North American thermostats predate Google&#39;s ownership of the company, which it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/02/googles-3-2-billion-nest-deal-is-official/">acquired in 2014</a>. Nest released the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-thermostat-that-learns-three-months-with-the-nest/">original Learning Thermostat</a> to almost universal praise in 2011, with the sequel arriving a year later. Google&#39;s second-gen Euro unit launched in 2014. Since launch, all these devices have been getting regular software updates and have migrated across multiple app redesigns. However, all good things must come to an end.</p>
<p>As Google points out, these products have had a long life, and they&#39;re not being rendered totally inoperable. Come October 25, 2025, these devices will no longer receive software updates or connect to Google&#39;s cloud services. That means you won&#39;t be able to control them from the Google Home app or via Assistant (or more likely Gemini by that point). The devices will still work as a regular dumb thermostat to control temperature, and scheduling will remain accessible from the thermostat&#39;s screen.</p>
<p>If you have one of these units, Google will be reaching out via email with some deals to soften the blow. In the US, owners can get a $130 discount if they upgrade to the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_learning_thermostat_4th_gen">fourth-gen Nest</a>, which was released just last year for $280. In Canada, the discount will be CA$160.</p>
