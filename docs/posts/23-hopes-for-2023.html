<div><p>I&#39;m not hoping for fully automated luxury world peace in this list because I&#39;m focusing on things I can control; better for my wishes to be considered than sloppy if they come true!</p>
<p>I want to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Finish out <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">recurse center</a> with something to show for it. I&#39;ve pivoted to looking at AI stuff despite not really knowing Python that well but it&#39;s fun going through the tutorials on <a href="https://www.fast.ai/">fast.ai</a>! I started off with <a href="https://automerge.org/">CRDT stuff</a> but my project was far too hard as it was Java + Rust + a bit of C and I am a newbie to the first two and don&#39;t know the last at all. I&#39;ve found it really helpful for thinking about my direction as a developer and what I like and want out of my career and learning. Definitely recommend!</li>
<li>Go deeper with JS specs. I want to read more about <a href="https://tc39.es/">TC39</a>, the various specs for ECMAScript and probably encounter many of the same worries about the web as I have for W3C. Thrilling stuff.</li>
<li>Keep exploring more of the new JS frameworks popping up; I&#39;ve experimented a little with Vite and Svelte.</li>
<li>Get better at JS in general. I think what I mean here is the stuff of software development; get better at debugging, system design, troubleshooting, problem solving, etc.</li>
<li>Do more &#34;content creation&#34; (I really hate the term but there isn&#39;t much better I can find that&#39;s easily understood). I enjoyed the stream I did on Twitch about Lensa a few weeks ago, and I&#39;m making a video for youtube based on the things I covered. I&#39;m hoping to make this a regular content funnel; twitch stream to chat, Youtube video and blog post to consolidate.</li>
<li>Get into powerlifting. I&#39;ve had a lot of false starts, this time I&#39;m hoping to make regular movement a habit.</li>
<li>Continue learning to sew. I love clothes so much but don&#39;t want to spend so much money and time looking for things I love.</li>
<li>Save more money.</li>
<li>Do more general purpose blogging.</li>
<li>Write more outside of my blog. I got a few pieces published last year, and would love to continue that trend.</li>
<li>Get better at seizing the day/taking initiative/doing the thing in every context.</li>
<li>Do a pottery taster.</li>
<li>Be a more caring and responsive member of my communities of kith and kin.</li>
<li>Learn to cook in a way that&#39;s more sustainable, more fun and less anxiety provoking for me.</li>
<li>Read more, especially fiction.</li>
<li>Do interesting and useful things with my union, UTAW. I&#39;m the women&#39;s and gender non-conforming persons&#39; officer this year!</li>
<li>Get more involved, politically and interpersonally, hyperlocally. Need to touch grass a tiny bit more ðŸ˜…</li>
<li>Get British citizenship application sent off.</li>
<li>Have <a href="https://meganeholstein.com/the-no-zero-days-productivity-mindset-might-change-your-life/">no more zero days</a>.</li>
<li>Keep going with <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2019/04/22/a-portable-routine/">my portable routine</a>.</li>
<li>Start journaling and mood tracking again.</li>
<li>Sleep well.</li>
<li>Grow, and often be happy.</li>
