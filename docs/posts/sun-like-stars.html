    <h1>&#39;Sun-Like&#39; Stars</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					<p>The thought of a planet orbiting a Sun-like star began to obsess me as a boy, when I realized how different all the planets in our Solar System were from each other. Clearly there were no civilizations on any planet but our own, at least around the Sun. But if Alpha Centauri had planets, then maybe one of them was more or less where Earth was in relation to its star. Meaning a benign climate, liquid water, and who knew, a flourishing culture of intelligent beings. So ran my thinking as a teenager, but then other questions began to arise.</p>
<p>Was Alpha Centauri Sun-like? Therein hangs a tale. As I began to read astronomy texts and realized how complicated the system was, the picture changed. Two stars and perhaps three, depending on how you viewed Proxima, were on offer here. ‘Sun-like’ seemed to imply a single star with stable orbits around it, but surely two stars as close as Centauri A and B would disrupt any worlds trying to form there. Later we would learn that stable orbits are indeed possible around both of these stars, and in the habitable zone, too (I still get emails from people saying no such orbits are possible, but they’re wrong).</p>
<p>So just how broad is the term ‘Sun-like’? One textbook told me that Centauri A was a Sun-like star, while Centauri B was sometimes described that way, and sometimes not. I thought the confusion would dissipate once I knew enough about astronomical terms, but if you look at scientific papers today, you’ll see that the term is still flexible. The problem is that by the time we move from a paper into the popular press, the term Sun-like begins to lose definition.</p>

<p><strong>Image:</strong>A direct image of a planetary system around a young K-class star, located about 300 light-years away and known as TYC 8998-760-1. The news release describes this as a Sun-like star, raising questions as to how we define the term. Image credit: ESO.</p>
<p>G-class stars are the category into which the Sun fits, with its lifetime on the order of 10 billion years, and if we expand its parameters a bit, we can take in stars around the Sun’s mass – perhaps 0.8 to 1.1 solar masses – and in the same temperature range – 5300 to 6000 K. Strictly speaking, then, Centauri B, which is a K-class star, doesn’t fit the definition of Sun-like, although K stars seem to be good options for habitable worlds. They’re less massive (0.45 to 0.8 solar masses) and cooler (3900 to 5300 K), and they’re more orange than yellow, and they’re longer lived than the Sun, a propitious thought in terms of astrobiology.</p>
<p>So we don’t want to be too doctrinaire in discussing what kind of star a habitable planet might orbit, but we do need to mind our definitions, because I see the term ‘Sun-like’ in so many different contexts. When I see a statement like “one Earth-class planet around every Sun-like star,” I have to ask whether we’re talking about G-class stars or something else. Because some scientists expand ‘Sun-like’ to include not only G- and K- but F-class stars as well. Why do this? Such stars are, like the Sun, long-lived. F stars are hotter and more massive than the Sun, but like G- and K-class stars, they’re stable. Some studies, then, consider ‘Sun-like’ to mean all FGK-type stars. </p>
<p>Some examples. ‘COROT finds exoplanet orbiting Sun-like star’ is the title of a news release that describes a star a bit more massive than the Sun. So the comparison is to G-class stars. ‘Astronomy researchers discover new planet around a ‘Sun-like’ star’ describes a planet around an F-class star, so we are in the FGK realm. ‘First Ever Image of a Multi-Planet System around a Sun-like Star Captured by ESO Telescope’ describes a planet around TYC 8998-760-1, a K-class dwarf.</p>
<p>So there’s method here, but it’s not always clarified as information moves from the academy (and the observatory) into the media. Confounding the picture still further are those papers that use ‘Sun-like’ to mean all stars on the Main Sequence. This takes in the entire range of stars OBAFGKM. This is a rare usage, but there is a certain logic here as well. If you’re looking for habitable planets, it’s clear that stars in the most stable phase of their lives are the ones to examine, burning hydrogen to produce energy. No brown dwarfs here, but the category does take in M-class stars, and the jury is out on whether such stars can support life. And they take in the huge majority of stars in the galaxy.</p>
<p>So if we’re talking about hydrogen burning, the Main Sequence offers up everything from hot blue stars all the way down to cool red dwarfs. End the hydrogen burning and a different phase of stellar evolution begins, producing for example the kind of white dwarf that the Sun will one day become. A paper’s context usually makes it perfectly clear which of the three takes on ‘Sun-like’ it is using, but the need to clarify the term in news releases, particularly when dealing with a wide range through F-, G- and K-class stars is evident. </p>
<p>All of this matters to the popular perception of what exoplanet researchers do because it wildly affects the numbers. G-class stars are thought to comprise about 7 percent of the stars in the galaxy, while K-class stars take in about 12 percent, and M-class dwarfs as high as 80 percent of the stellar population. Saying there is an Earth-class planet around every Sun-like star thus could mean ‘around 7 percent of the stars in the Milky Way.’ Or it could mean ‘around 22 percent of the stars in the Milky Way, if we mean FGK host stars.</p>
<p>If we included red dwarf stars, it could mean ‘around about 95 percent of the stars in the galaxy,’ excluding evolved, non-Main Sequence objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars and red giants. Everything depends upon how the terms are defined. I keep getting emails about this. My colleague <a href="https://www.drewexmachina.com/blog/">Andrew Le Page</a> is a stickler for terminology in the same way I am, with his most trenchant comments being reserved for too facile use of the term ‘habitable.’ </p>
<p>So we’ve got to be careful in this burgeoning field. Exoplanet researchers are aware of the need to establish the meaning of ‘Sun-like’ carefully. The fact that the public’s interest in exoplanets is growing means, however, that in public utterances like news releases, scientists need to clarify what they’re talking about. It’s the same thing that makes the term ‘Earth-like’ so ambiguous. A planet as massive as the Earth? A planet that is rocky as opposed to gaseous? A planet in the habitable zone of its star? Is a planet on a wildly elliptical orbit crossing in and out of the habitable zone of an F-class host Earth-like? </p>
<p>Let’s watch our terms so we don’t confuse everybody who is not in the business of studying exoplanets full-time. The interface between professional journals and public venues like websites and newspapers is important because it can have effects on funding, which in today’s climate is a highly charged issue. A confused public is less likely to support studies in areas it does not understand. </p>
