      <p><strong>Fair warning:</strong> this is about as broad as the range of
my posts, so expect a wild flow of ideas across various domains.</p>
<p>A bit of feedback I receive a lot in conversations with
recruiters/headhunters is that my profile is too broad. I understand
that they look mostly for keywords, and I’ve never cared to SEO-ify my
resume. Combine this with a person who likes to work on building teams
as much as compilers, oscillates between network automation and
integrating LLMs into business flows, conducts security workshops and
technical due diligence, and you have a hireability nightmare. But I
don’t experience it as disparate. It’s all about (user) experience.</p>
<h2 id="a-disclaimer">A disclaimer</h2>
<p>Before addressing the general thrust of my thesis, let me get the
elephant in the room out: my general privilege in having to explain
myself.</p>
<p>Now, the first thing is that I’ve been lucky enough to never truly
have to worry about this. I do not pretend to be the world’s foremost
authority on any of these. I do claim to have deep proficiency, but
these are different things. Intellectual curiosity and a good baseline
can get you to proficiency in adjacent fields rather quickly. Reaching a
level of an internationally recognized subject matter expert takes a
lifetime. My profile requires the former: I help solve a broad class of
problems well, and I am able to connect the dots. It requires a good
deal of honesty, because I need to tell people very clearly what I
cannot help them with, but I don’t have a problem with that.</p>
<p>I also usually operate in high trust environments, working with
people I’ve worked with before, and I rarely need to “prove” my chops.
We can focus on solving problems together, rather than having to make me
look impactful on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>But that’s not really what I want to talk about today, anyway. Let’s
talk about user experience, shall we?</p>
<h2 id="the-world-as-an-experience-problem">The world as an experience
problem</h2>
<p>As I pointed out above, the way I perceive all of the fields I work
in, they are not as disparate as they may seem. At its heart, all of my
work boils down to a study of user experience, and often those users are
developers.</p>
<p>When I say thinking about user experience I mean thinking about
cognitive load and how to reduce it, feedback loops and how to shorten
them, and making the default path the right one.</p>
<h3 id="deep-tech-work-experience">Deep tech work: experience</h3>
<p>I worked on all of my most complex deep tech work through that lens,
and it might explain the weird technical gap between a lot of the things
I work on.</p>
<ul>
<li>When working on the <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/carp/">Carp</a> programming language,
my personal main question was how far we can take the compiler
ergonomics. We combined type and lifetime inference and opened up as
much of the internals as possible while simultaneously making it
hopefully unnecessary for users to go too deep, and wrote a strong set
of standard and standard-adjacent libraries. My main goal was to see how
far I can push the ergonomics while making no concessions to runtime and
performance.</li>
<li>My work on <a href="https://gtoolkit.com">Glamorous Toolkit</a> was
influenced by a deep desire to make building tools habitual by making it
easy and quickly amortized. By solving this problem, navigating a system
becomes about its shape, not about the shape of the tool you use to view
it through.</li>
<li>The recent work on <a href="https://github.com/hellerve-pl-experiments/cj">cj</a>, my minimal
JIT compiler framework, has been a study of simplicity and joy. How
bare-bones can the API be while still feeling like a delight? How little
do we need to feel enabled to write complex JIT compilers for real
languages? What if I told my users to bring their own register
allocator, intermediate representation, labeling logic? Would it still
work?</li>
</ul>
<p>But this quest in exploring experiences is not limited to deep
technical work.</p>
<h3 id="organisations-products-experience">Organisations, products:
experience</h3>
<p>My general view on user experience also shapes how I think about
products and organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I build network automation, I want to help people think about
their architecture, not about their individual configurations. I want to
help them make most of their fabric-level decisions directly actionable
rather than having their network engineers translate that into a bunch
of commands in a Junos shell.</li>
<li>I start with a knowledge problem when working with LLMs. The usual
problem is that there are one or more sources of knowledge with various
sorting and organizing conventions, and no one can actually get to the
information they need. Yes, LLMs can help solve this problem, but I’d
like to spend time thinking about the way knowledge is structured and
organized rather than jumping straight into discussions about AWS
Bedrock vs direct OpenAI access and Pydantic vs. Agno. Both
conversations matter, but we get lost in our tools all too quickly, and
then never come up for air again.</li>
<li>Similarly, when I think about a team’s or company’s processes, I
think about how they help people navigate through the company and
execute efficiently while staying true to the company’s goals (including
compliance, responsibilities, and the like). I’d like to spend time
observing the desire paths through the org chart and the most and least
viewed parts of an ISMS and use those to guide gentle transformation. It
all becomes a UX problem with the employees as users.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I started thinking about this, it all fell into place:
everything I do is about making systems navigable by people. Sometimes
the systems are technical, sometimes they are not.</p>
<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>
<p>As all too often, I don’t really have a main takeaway for this. I
woke up at 5:30am with this thought and couldn’t let it go, so I wrote
it down before the little ones would stir and replace this idea with
more important—definitely more urgent—topics.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve asked yourself what I’m about, and why I seem to do and
write about so many different things, and maybe this might help answer
it. I probably won’t send it to recruiters that want me to highlight my
experience with Rust or Scrum more, though.</p>
