    <h1>Tell HN: Books Printed by Amazon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I buy a lot of books from Amazon (EU). Recently, more and more of the books I received were printed by Amazon themselves with the message &#34;Printed in Poland by Amazon Fulfillment&#34; on the last page.</p><p>They are of decent quality, though sometimes the cover art might be lower-resolution than that of an equivalent book from a bookshop. I double checked and all of these were sold by Amazon themselves (i.e., not a marketplace seller, where I would suspect a piracy issue). The cover material is always this unpleasant matte rough-feeling paper.</p><p>Is there anything nefarious going on here? Does Amazon have permission from the publishers to distribute their books like this? The books that I received were of different publishers (Penguin, Basic Books, among others).</p></div></div></div>
