    <h1>Ask HN: The government of my country blocked VPN access. What should I use?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indonesia is currently in chaos.

Usually we can use Cloudflare&#39;s WARP to avoid it, but just today they blocked the access as well. What alternative should we use?</p></div></div>
