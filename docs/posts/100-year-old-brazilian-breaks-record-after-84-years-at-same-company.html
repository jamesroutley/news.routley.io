                        <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">How long have you been working in the same company? Five years? Ten? </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Walter Orthmann (Brazil) has been working at the same company for 84 years and 9 days, as verified on 6 January 2022. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His passion, discipline and commitment motivated him to keep doing what he loves and, eventually, become an official Guinness World Records title holder for the <strong>longest career in the same company</strong>. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img xlink:href="tcm:25-701667" title="Walter-Ortham-holding-GWR-certificate" alt="Walter-Ortham-holding-GWR-certificate" width="684" height="456" xlink:title="Walter-Ortham-holding-GWR-certificate" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/images/css/g.jpg" data-src="/Images/Walter-Ortham-holding-GWR-certificate_tcm25-701667.jpg"/></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 17 January 1938, Walter Orthmann started work as a shipping assistant when he was fifteen years old at a textile company in Santa Catarina, Brazil called Industrias Renaux S.A. (now known as ReneauxView). </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Walter has always been very enthusiastic when it comes to learning something new. He was born in Brusque, a small town in Santa Catarina, Brazil which has a large German population. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img xlink:href="tcm:25-701831" title="Walter Orthmann´s first day at Industrias Renaux" alt="Walter Orthmann´s first day at Industrias Renaux" width="500" height="600" xlink:title="Walter ortmann starting at Industrias Renaux" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/images/css/g.jpg" data-src="/Images/Walter-ortmann-starting-at-Industrias-Renaux_tcm25-701831.jpg"/></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rain or shine, mud or frost, propelled by his tenacity, Walter would walk barefoot to school to study and then practice at home. He was an exceptional student with a brilliant memory and attention to detail.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, due to financial problems at home, he began to work to help his family. He went to the weaving mill with his mom to apply for a job, and, because of his strong proficiency in German, he was hired. He has worked at the same company, ReneauxView, ever since.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&#34;Back in 1938, kids were expected to work to help support the family. As the oldest son of five, my mother took me to find a job at the age of 14.&#34; - <em>Walter Orthmann</em></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> After getting his first position as a shipping assistant, Walter showed outstanding skills and willingness to learn, always doing more than expected.  </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shortly after, he was promoted to a position in sales. Then, he became a successful Sales Manager. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img xlink:href="tcm:25-701668" title="Walter Ortham at the office" alt="Walter Ortham at the office" width="684" height="456" xlink:title="Walter Ortham at the office" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/images/css/g.jpg" data-src="/Images/Walter-Ortham-at-the-office_tcm25-701668.jpg"/> </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&#34;I was given the opportunity to work as a salesperson. I traveled to São Paulo and in less than one week I filled the production with orders equivalent of three month of work.&#34;<em> </em></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> Walter believes that the best part about having a job is that it gives you a sense of purpose, commitment and a routine. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the fifties, he started traveling across the country and had the opportunity to meet people from different places and cultures. He fell in love with being constantly on the move and establishing good relationships with clients who became friends. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Throughout his 84 years of work, he has seen many things change in the company, in the country and in the world. As a result, he has come to understand that one of the most important parts of the business is to always be up-to-date and to adapt to different contexts. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <img xlink:href="tcm:25-701669" title="Record holder with black suit" alt="Record holder with black suit" width="750" height="456" xlink:title="Record holder with black suit" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/images/css/g.jpg" data-src="/Images/Record-holder-with-black-suit_tcm25-701669.jpg"/></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> On 19 April 2022, Walter Orthmann turned 100 years old.  He celebrated his centenary in the company of his coworkers, friends and family with an unforgettable party. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> His charisma, empathy and humanity makes him a strong and meaningful leader. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><img xlink:href="tcm:25-701671" title="Walter Ortham b-day celebration" alt="Walter Ortham b-day celebration" width="784" height="456" xlink:title="Walter Ortham b-day celebration" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/images/css/g.jpg" data-src="/Images/Walter-Ortham-b-day-celebration_tcm25-701671.jpg"/></p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">&#34;When we do what we like, we don&#39;t see the time go by.&#34;</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He is in good health, with excellent mental clarity and memory. He enjoys a calm life and exercises every day. As a result, he has been able to maintain enough vitality and energy to drive to his favorite place every day: the office. </p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He comments that the best professional advice he can give is to try to work for a good company and in an area where you feel motivated. </p><div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><p><img xlink:href="tcm:25-701666" title="Walter Ortham Longest career in the same company" alt="Walter Ortham Longest career in the same company" width="800" height="456" xlink:title="Walter Ortham Longest career in the same company" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" src="https://www.bryanbraun.com/images/css/g.jpg" data-src="/Images/Walter-Ortham-Longest-career-in-the-same-company-Thumbnail-image_tcm25-701666.png"/><br/></p><p>Walter has achieved a record-breaking career with many memorable moments by believing in the power of the present. </p><p>&#34;I don’t do much planning, nor care much about tomorrow. All I care about is that tomorrow will be another day in which I will wake up, get up, exercise and go to work; you need to get busy with the present, not the past or the future. Here and now is what counts. So, let’s go to work!&#34;</p><p>For Walter, breaking a Guinness World Records title is an honor and a privilege. He would never have imagined that he would achieve one. </p><p>&#34;Looking back, despite never having contemplated breaking a record, I think my proudest achievement was being certified as the title holder for the <strong>longest career in the same company</strong>.&#34;</p><p> Walter broke his <a href="http://https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2018/6/this-man-in-brazil-has-worked-for-the-same-company-for-80-years-528563">own record</a> set in 2019 with 81 years and 85 days. </p></div>
