    <h1>Japan city drafts ordinance to cap smartphone use at 2 hours per day</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>NAGOYA - A central Japan city said Thursday it will seek to pass an ordinance recommending all residents limit smartphone use to two hours a day outside of work and school amid concerns over the impact of excessive technology exposure, though there will be no penalties proposed.</p>

<p>The ordinance drafted by the city of Toyoake in Aichi Prefecture is likely to be the first such municipal regulation in Japan that targets a limit on the use of smartphones and other electronic devices, according to the city. If passed by the local assembly, the ordinance will come into effect on Oct. 1.</p>

<p>&#34;We want the ordinance to provide an opportunity for people to think about how they use smartphones,&#34; an official said.</p>

<p>To ensure that children get a good night&#39;s sleep, the draft ordinance urges elementary school students to refrain from using smartphones after 9 p.m. and junior high students and older to put their devices down by 10 p.m.</p>

<p>The draft acknowledged that smartphones, personal computers and tablets are necessities, but warned that overuse of social media and video streaming may have a negative impact on health and family life.</p>

<p>The city will work with schools and parents to promote the healthy use of electronic devices, according to the draft ordinance.</p>
