    <h1>Masked email is a killer feature for Fastmail</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p><picture><source srcset="/images/2023-09-24-masked-email-painting-of-different-emails-flowing-into-one.webp" type="image/webp"/><img alt="Painting of different emails flowing into one" src="https://macwright.com/images/2023-09-24-masked-email-painting-of-different-emails-flowing-into-one.jpg"/></picture></p><p>I last <a href="https://macwright.com/2018/04/26/leaving-google">sang the praises of Fastmail in 2018</a>, writing about how it’s pretty easy to avoid Google now that Google’s products are relatively middling. I’ve been using <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> exclusively since then and have only good things to say about it. The user interface is rock-solid and fast, and there have been very few times that they’ve had a server outage. But it’s just been qualitatively better than Gmail, not differentiated by a feature.</p><h3 id="masked-email">Masked email</h3><p>That’s changed: I think that Fastmail’s “Masked Email” is a good reason for the Gmail-faithful to switch. It’s both a fantastic way to manage spam sources and a real win for privacy.</p><p>Masked email works best when you also use <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>. You can then <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/blog/masked-email-from-fastmail-and-1password-protects-your-identity-online/">link your 1Password and Fastmail accounts</a>, and whenever you see a signup form on the web, not only will 1Password offer to generate a password, it’ll also trigger Fastmail to generate a new, unique email address. That email address connects to your existing inbox, and also has a note for why it was generated – so you can easily identify senders that sold or leaked their email lists. Then, you can just block that email address.</p><p>I’ve been using the heck out of this feature: I have over 100 masked email addresses and use a masked email for basically every new service I try out or newsletter I subscribe to. It’s taken the concept of disposable email addresses that was floating around for years in the form of <a href="https://www.guerrillamail.com/">guerillamail</a> and others and formalized it into a system in which it’s easy to <em>default to</em> using a disposable email address for everything.</p><p>This isn’t just good for dodging spam: when you sign up for services, they can use contact enrichment tools like <a href="https://clearbit.com/">Clearbit</a> to connect your email to your identity elsewhere. A primary email address can be the key to cross-referencing all of your internet presences.</p><p>Plus, attacks like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing">credential stuffing</a> are based on the idea of shared email &amp; password combinations. Even if you studiously avoid sharing passwords between websites, you can do even better by randomizing email addresses so that attackers don’t know either part of the email &amp; password combination.</p><h3 id="hide-my-email">Hide my email</h3><p>Apple has a similar service called Hide my Email, which I also use when I’m on a phone – that acts as a relay service between your generated email and your own. It works well, but the only way I’ve found to use it on the desktop is with a third-party <a href="https://github.com/dedoussis/icloud-hide-my-email-browser-extension">Chrome Extension</a>. If you use and like iCloud services and aren’t going to switch to Fastmail, that seems like a viable option.</p><h3 id="idependence">Idependence</h3><p>One quirk of these generated email addresses - for Fastmail and iCloud both - is that they’re both generated with their email providers’ domains by default. Hide My Email addresses are under the <code>icloud.com</code> domain and Fastmail’s are under <code>fastmail.com</code>. This does change how easily you can migrate away from a provider. Migrating a single custom email address from one provider to another is simple, but if you have nearly one email address per account, it’s harder.</p><p>Thankfully, Fastmail lets you generate masked email addresses under a custom domain. I will probably do this in the future, so that if I ever have to switch away from them, I can just add a catchall email address at that domain to keep receiving the emails.</p><h3 id="addresses--phone-numbers">Addresses &amp; phone numbers</h3><p>It’d be nice to have these kinds of anonymized versions of the rest of our personal data.</p><p>You can get a separate mailbox with <a href="https://www.earthclassmail.com/">Earth Class Mail</a> or as part of your business’s registered agent with <a href="https://www.northwestregisteredagent.com/">Northwest</a>.</p><p>I’d love to have a similar service for phone numbers: because I was an early employee at a few startups and foolishly used my own phone number when we signed up with some providers, I get calls from salespeople trying to reach my long-ago employers. I’m trying out <a href="https://www.burnerapp.com/">Burner</a>, which issues additional proxied phone numbers, so I don’t have to give my personal phone number for everything.</p></div><p><postamble datetime="2023-09-24">September 24, 2023</postamble>  <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=tmcw&amp;user_id=1458271" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Follow me on Twitter">@tmcw</a></p></article></div></div>
