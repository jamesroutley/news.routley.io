    <h1>Work on tasks, not stories</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One tenet of big-a Agile<sup><a href="#big-a-agile">1</a></sup> is that developers should all work on individual user stories as the smallest unit of work<sup><a href="#agile-stories">2</a></sup>.
That a ticket should almost always be a story, because that means it&#39;s something that delivers <em>concrete value</em> to the users.</p>
<p>There are some cases in which this leads to absurdity.
I&#39;ve written tongue-in-cheek tickets of this type at work before, on a platform team:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;As a DAYJOB engineering team, I want...&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;As a configuration file, I want...&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ve also seen this done as a serious story, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law">Poe&#39;s law</a> struck and it&#39;s impossible to tell if it&#39;s satire.</p>
<p><strong>This has it all backwards.</strong>
User stories are great for tracking what users should be able to do and how to deliver value.
But they&#39;re <em>not</em> great for understanding the work to be done.</p>
<p>A story can require a surprisingly large or small amount of work.
You don&#39;t know until you break it down by analyzing how to <em>do the task</em> that&#39;s behind the story.
We end up doing this and using stories in a way that leads to convoluted ticket titles, which all but tell you what the hidden task actually is.</p>
<p>Instead, tickets should be honest and be a straightforward <em>task</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#34;Add port option to configuration file&#34;</li>
<li>&#34;Make checkout button disabled if any fields are invalid&#34;</li>
</ul>
<p>These tickets can be <em>related</em> to stories, either multiple tickets to a story or one-to-one, but they are a far better mapping to the work done on an engineering team than stories are<sup><a href="#division-of-work">3</a></sup>.
It makes it clear what is to be done, and it avoids convoluted stories for things that are just absolutely <em>not</em> user stories.</p>
<p>To be clear: you <em>must</em> still think about what the user needs, and think critically about the implementation at hand.
It&#39;s just that writing it as a story <em>doesn&#39;t</em> give you this for free, just as writing a task does not.
Writing a story masks the task behind a veneer, but it is still fundamentally a task.
So if you have a task and the task does not clearly relate back to something that&#39;s needed for the user (or the org, or some useful purpose), then that&#39;s a <em>great</em> time to clarify <em>why</em> this task needs to be done.
Maybe it doesn&#39;t!</p>
<p>But it&#39;s still a task, not a story.</p>

<div id="big-a-agile"><p><sup>1</sup></p><p>This is to draw a distinction between the industry that&#39;s sprung up around &#34;Agile&#34;, vs. the principles/practices recommended in the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">agile manifesto</a>. The former is cargo-culted quite a bit and has some problems, while the latter says to emphasize flexibility over dogma.</p>
</div>
<div id="agile-stories"><p><sup>2</sup></p><p>See, for instance, this <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/user-stories">Atlassian article</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="division-of-work"><p><sup>3</sup></p><p>Splitting it up this way also makes responsibilities clearer: product management is responsible for creating stories, and engineering is responsible for creating the tasks to achieve those. Without this split, it&#39;s ambiguous and varies team-to-team and day-to-day.</p>
