  <p>LRtDW is a series of articles putting Rust features in context for low-level C
programmers who maybe don’t have a formal CS background — the sort of
people who work on firmware, game engines, OS kernels, and the like. Basically,
people like me.</p>
<p>I’ve added Rust to my toolbelt, and I hope to get you excited enough to do the
same.</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>
<p><a href="https://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/0/">Why Learn Rust the Dangerous Way?</a> Introduction and ground rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/1/">You can’t write C in just any ol’ language:</a> translating a grungy
optimized C program into grungy optimized unsafe Rust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/2/">References available upon request:</a> how Rust <em>references</em> are
different from pointers, how they are the same, and why we care.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/3/">Measure what you optimize:</a> taking a hard look at an optimization
based on uninitialized memory, and converting it to safe code that’s just as
fast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/4/">A more perfect union:</a> considering alternatives to pointer casting,
and how to write safe wrappers for <code>unsafe</code> operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/5/">Making safe things from unsafe parts:</a> finally converting most of the
program to safe code, and making sure that the <code>unsafe</code> bits are safe-ish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/6/">Let the compiler do the work:</a> a <strong>bonus section</strong> that looks at how
we’d write the program idiomatically in native Rust, and rely on
auto-vectorization to make it fast.</p>
