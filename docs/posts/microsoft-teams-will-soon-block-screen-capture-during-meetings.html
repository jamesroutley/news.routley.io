<p>Microsoft is working on adding a new Teams feature that will prevent users from capturing screenshots of sensitive information shared during meetings.</p>

<p>Those joining from unsupported platforms will be automatically placed in audio-only mode to protect shared content. The company plans to start rolling out this new Teams feature to Android, desktop, iOS, and web users worldwide in July 2025.</p>

<p>&#34;To address the issue of unauthorized screen captures during meetings, the Prevent Screen Capture feature ensures that if a user attempts to take a screen capture, the meeting window will turn black, thereby protecting sensitive information,&#34; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490051" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft shared</a> in a new Microsoft 365 roadmap entry.</p>

<p>&#34;This feature will be available on Teams desktop applications (both Windows and Mac) and Teams mobile applications (both iOS and Android).&#34;</p>

<p>However, it should be noted that, even if screenshots are blocked, sensitive media and information shared in Teams meetings can still be captured by taking a photo of the conversation.</p>

<p>Last month, Meta introduced a similar WhatsApp feature named &#34;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/whatsapps-new-advanced-chat-privacy-protects-sensitive-messages/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Advanced Chat Privacy</a>,&#34; which protects sensitive information exchanged in private chats and group conversations by blocking attempts to save shared media and export chat content.</p>

<p>Redmond will also roll out a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490050" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">town hall screen privilege management update</a> in Teams Rooms on Windows, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490564" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interactive BizChat/Copilot Studio agents</a> in meetings and 1-on-1 calls, and a Copilot feature to help <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=488807" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">generate audio overviews</a> of transcribed meetings in June.</p>

<p>Another Copilot feature to help <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=488807" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">generate audio overviews</a> of transcribed meetings is also under development and will let users choose the speakers, adjust the tone, and tailor the length.</p>

<p>In January, the company <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-teams-phishing-attack-alerts-coming-to-everyone-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reminded Microsoft 365 admins</a> that its new Teams Chat brand impersonation protection feature, which alerts users when detecting phishing attacks targeting organizations with external Teams access toggled on, will be made generally available for all customers by mid-February 2025.</p>

<p>At last year&#39;s Enterprise Connect enterprise communications and collaboration conference, Microsoft <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamsblog/microsoft-teams-building-a-foundation-for-the-future/4090393" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a> that the Teams platform had reached over 320 million monthly active users across 181 markets and 44 languages.</p>
