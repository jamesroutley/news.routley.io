            <p>


                The Sifter is a public database, free to all users. It is a tool for finding and comparing historical and contemporary writing on food and food-related topics. It is overseen
                by an advisory board composed of members from The Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery as well as other friends of food history. As with Wikipedia, the Sifter will be populated
                by its users. All entries will have an English translation, enabling users to search languages they cannot read. Soon, we will have over 100 languages represented. Registered
                users will be able to make corrections and add new information. Future releases will include a data visualization component. We also plan to include more resources linking to
                digitized photographs, artworks, television and film. With the aid of this tool, it is our hope that what has been invisible will come into focus.
