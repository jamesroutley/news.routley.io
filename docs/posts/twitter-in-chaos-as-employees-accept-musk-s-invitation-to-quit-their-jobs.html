<p>The situation at Twitter grew even more chaotic over the past day as all remaining employees were forced to choose whether to stay and meet owner Elon Musk&#39;s demands or leave now and take three months&#39; severance. Musk had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/musk-tells-twitter-staff-agree-to-work-long-hours-at-high-intensity-or-quit-now/">sent an ultimatum</a> to staff earlier this week, saying they must commit to &#34;working long hours at high intensity&#34; in order to keep their jobs.</p>
<p>&#34;lf you are sure that you want to be part of the new Twitter, please click yes on the link below,&#34; Musk wrote. &#34;Anyone who has not done so by 5pm ET tomorrow (Thursday) will receive three months of severance.&#34;</p>
<p>As the deadline passed yesterday, at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/17/23465274/hundreds-of-twitter-employees-resign-from-elon-musk-hardcore-deadline">hundreds of employees</a> reportedly didn&#39;t fill out the form and thus chose to leave. Twitter reportedly informed staff that it was closing all office buildings and disabling employee badge access until Monday.</p>
<p>&#34;In Twitter&#39;s internal chat tool, over 500 employees wrote farewell messages on Thursday, a source familiar with the notes said,&#34; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/after-elon-musks-ultimatum-twitter-employees-start-exiting-2022-11-18/">according to Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;The best people are staying, so I’m not super worried,&#34; Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1593453455972057090">wrote</a>.</p>
<h2>Half may have left, but reports vary</h2>
<p>Exactly how many people opted into staying at Twitter isn&#39;t clear yet. Twitter reportedly no longer has a communications department to relay information to the media, but it&#39;s possible the company will be left with a skeleton staff compared to what it had just a few weeks ago.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>&#34;Less than half of the company&#39;s remaining roughly 4,000 employees chose on Thursday to stay at the company and sign up for Musk&#39;s &#39;Twitter 2.0,&#39;&#34; <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-elon-musk-half-working-2022-11">Business Insider reported</a> last night, citing &#34;a person familiar with the company&#39;s processes.&#34;</p>
<p>When Musk took over Twitter on October 27, the company had around 7,500 employees. Musk laid off about <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/twitter-shuts-offices-for-day-as-it-cuts-50-of-workforce-staff-already-suing/">half of them</a> barely a week later, but the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/musk-led-twitter-laid-off-some-employees-by-mistake-asks-them-to-come-back/">asked back dozens</a> who apparently were laid off by mistake. Musk also laid off thousands of contractors and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/musk-bans-remote-work-at-twitter-warns-staff-of-dire-economic-outlook/">banned remote work</a>, likely guaranteeing more employee departures.</p>
<p>With &#34;#RIPTwitter&#34; and &#34;#TwitterDown&#34; trending, there were rumors suggesting without concrete evidence that 75 percent of remaining employees left. That percentage may be true at least in specific parts of the company. &#34;Out of one group of about 60 employees, roughly 50 percent to 75 percent told colleagues they planned to depart, one person said Thursday morning,&#34; The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-workers-brace-for-another-round-of-departures-as-musk-ultimatum-looms-11668716881">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/17/technology/twitter-elon-musk-ftc.html">described</a> a poll of almost 250 people that came up with a departure percentage of nearly 75 percent:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Blind, a social platform where anonymous users talk about their workplaces, a poll of nearly 250 people associated with Twitter showed that about 73 percent favored taking the severance package over staying. People who decided to stay still believed in Twitter&#39;s mission of giving people a voice or had visas tied to their jobs or other personal reasons, two people said.</p></blockquote>
