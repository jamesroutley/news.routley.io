    <h1>86Box – Low level x86 emulator that runs older operating systems and software</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p><strong>86Box</strong> is a low level x86 emulator that runs older operating systems and software designed for IBM PC systems and compatibles from 1981 through fairly recent system designs based on the PCI bus.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to use interface inspired by mainstream hypervisor software</li>
  <li>Low level emulation of 8086-based processors up to the Pentium with focus on accuracy</li>
  <li>Great range of customizability of virtual machines</li>
  <li>Many available systems, such as the very first IBM PC 5150 from 1981, or the more obscure IBM PS/2 line of systems based on the Micro Channel Architecture</li>
  <li>Lots of supported peripherals including video adapters, sound cards, network adapters, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters</li>
  <li>MIDI output to Windows built-in MIDI support, FluidSynth, or emulated Roland synthesizers</li>
  <li>Supports running MS-DOS, older Windows versions, OS/2, many Linux distributions, or vintage systems such as BeOS or NEXTSTEP, and applications for these systems</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="downloads">Downloads</h2>

<p>The latest stable version of 86Box is <strong>v3.11</strong>, which was released on November 26, 2022, and is available from our <a href="https://github.com/86Box/86Box/releases/latest">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>We also offer <a href="https://ci.86box.net/job/86Box">nightly builds</a>, which are built from the latest source code, but may not be as stable and/or optimized as stable builds.</p>

<h2 id="minimum-system-requirements-and-recommendations">Minimum system requirements and recommendations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Intel Core 2 or AMD Athlon 64 processor</li>
  <li>Windows version: Windows 7 Service Pack 1, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10</li>
  <li>Linux version: Ubuntu 16.04, Debian 9.0 or other distributions from 2016 onwards</li>
  <li>macOS version: macOS High Sierra 10.13</li>
  <li>4 GB of RAM</li>
</ul>

<p>Performance may vary depending on both host and guest configuration. Most emulation logic is executed in a single thread; therefore, systems with better IPC (instructions per clock) generally should be able to emulate higher clock speeds.</p>

<p>It is also recommended to use a manager application with 86Box for easier handling of multiple virtual machines.</p>
