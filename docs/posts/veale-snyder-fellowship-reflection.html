<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>The
<a href="https://case.edu/entrepreneurship/fellowships/veale-snyder-fellowship-program">Veale Snyder Fellowship</a>
is a 1 year entrepreneurship fellowship program at
<a href="https://case.edu/">Case Western</a>. It’s a two part program directed by
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mgoldberg2">Michael Goldberg</a> and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stacey-lotz-982484162/">Stacey Lotz</a>, where in the
fall semester there’s a 1 credit course taught by
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josediazs">Jose Dias Salazar</a> and a trip to San
Francisco to meet various companies in SF and Silicone Valley, along with many
Case alum, VCs, and entrepreneurs, and then in spring a 3 credit course and
international trip to the Czech Republic.</p>
<h2 id="why-me">Why me?</h2>
<p>If you read my blog, you probably already know that I’m a very technical person.
I’m interested in software, computers, webdev/fullstack, devtools,
devops/linux/nix, and a plethora of other techy things. I love reading about
shiny new typescript frameworks, and how fixed points work in nix. What am I
doing in an entrepreneurship program?</p>
<p>In my application, I stated this well and succinctly,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years, I’ve arrived at an ultimate interest in entrepreneurial
webdev. I love the interconnectedness and accessibility: how it enables rapid
contrivance of genuinely useful applications. I have always found realizing my
own project ideas to not just be the best way for me to learn, but also to be
most satisfying and fun. My favorite thing in this world is learning things
that I want to learn, because I want to learn them. I see impatience as a
virtue, a quest for speed and efficiency that naturally harmonizes with my
field of interest. In the end, I feel pretty strongly that, eventually,
entrepreneurship will be a big part of my future vocational journey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is pretty consistent with my current thoughts on why I’m here now. The only
realization I’ve had since is how my area of focus has shifted more specifically
for creating things to solve the problems that I myself face, which there’s
hints of in my previous thoughts — I’m most interested in using fullstack
technologies that I love using to alleviate developer experience (devx)
friction. I want to make the world (for developers) a better place, so they can
make the world (in general) one.</p>

<p>One of the hallmarks of this program is a trip to the bay area between the 20th
to the afternoon of the 22nd of October (2024). It’s a very packed two days,
where we get to experience entrepreneurship in SF/the valley. It was a really,
really fantastic, eye opening experience — I got to meet so many people and see
so many different company cultures and philosophies in such a short time span.</p>

for the trip! One of the coolest parts of the fellowship is how we stick around
with the same group of people and all get to know each other. It was a really
cool coincidence that most of us are CS people with technical interests; I’ve
managed to sneak in some talk of flutter and system design with Allesandro, or
system design, graph generation, and AWS lambdas with Vidyut!</p>

really great reflections with awesome comprehensive overviews of everything that
we did during the trip, so I want to focus on my takeaways, but I’ll keep it
sequential. This is my first (but definitely not my last) non-technical blog!</p>
<h2 id="the-trip">The trip</h2>
<p>Sunday was more about experiencing SF. We rode in <a href="https://waymo.com/">Waymo</a>
self-driving cars, which was an incredible experience. There was a lot of talk
about self driving cars across almost all the companies we visited; it’s a trend
that seems very well accepted. It seems like, for companies with the resources,
there’s a pretty big pressure, perhaps out of expectation, that they invest in
“trends” that <em>could</em> be the future.</p>
<h2 id="companies">Companies</h2>
<h3 id="fountain">Fountain</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/20241025035853.png" alt="Visiting Fountain"/></p>
<p>On Monday, we started out by heading over to
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/fountaininc">Fountain</a>, a software company for
recruiting and optimizing hourly wage employee retention. We spoke with
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanbehr">Sean Behr</a> about his entrepreneurial
philosophies.</p>
<p>We’d already met Sean virtually during our first class. I’d say his unique takes
were that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed is key. The faster you get a product out the door, the faster you can
know to kill it (or accelerate it).</li>
<li>Adapting is necessary. The product isn’t going to be a masterpiece unless you
meld it into one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Entering his office, it was amazing to see how many people had migrated to work
remotely. Honestly, it was a bit sad to see — I’m a big proponent of pair
programming and collaborative workflows, but it seems like it’s a dying desire.
Sean seemed to agree in the importance of in person collaboration (and cost of
lack thereof).</p>
<p>This time, there was a bit more focus on company culture, and company/system
dynamics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Culture
<ul>
<li>Culture is largely immutable. It is also in part a function of company
success. Extreme success fosters positive culture. So, CEOs steer for
economic success to drive culture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adaptability
<ul>
<li>There’s <em>discrete</em> categories of success, and it’s really, really hard to
traverse up the latter. You <em>need</em> to be able to adapt to climb in the long
term. But, sometimes it’s just not possible to adapt fast enough, and you
can’t win.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Organization
<ul>
<li>Clarity is very important. Every piece of data <em>could</em> be important, any
abstraction on the raw datapoints is lossy.</li>
<li>Having some sort of project management is really important. Set goals are
good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Market Research
<ul>
<li>Connecting with clients and asking about their needs is the best way to
improve. Directly mentioning the product induces bias, so sometimes it’s
best to ask surrounding questions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I really like Sean’s focus on efficiency. I think his thoughts on culture are
very valid, but that “good” culture doesn’t <em>require</em> vast success, just that
the success is a way to induce culture. This is also why it’s so critical to
choose an awesome co-founder and founding team to establish a good culture from
the start.</p>
<p>Sean believes that some traits are critical for a successful culture. I think
he’s right, but I also feel these traits are in flux with the state of the
company.</p>
<p>He honors speed and responsibility, and I think these are really really
important early on, but less so as the company evolves. By reducing
responsibility and honoring exploration, larger companies we visited like Google
and NVIDIA have been able to accomplish insane things.</p>
<p>Finally, there seemed to be an emphasis on <em>identification</em> and explicitness, on
the “tangibility” of goals, values, ideas, and pretty much everything he values
and talked about. Writing things down is really, really important. It makes them
real.</p>
<h3 id="nvidia">NVIDIA</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/20241025041604.png" alt="Nvidia &#34;Fireside chat&#34;"/>
<img src="https://static.404wolf.com/20241025041624.png" alt="HQ Tour"/></p>
<p>Nvidia was an entirely different experience than Fountain. Walking into their
headquarters was like walking into an airport. You could tell that if you were
to talk to anyone, they’d have a really interesting story to tell, but everyone
seemed to be laser focused on their own chunks of work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabrinatrans/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BrCNagRURT%2FiAl%2BHW861hEg%3D%3D">Sabrina Trans</a>
gave us a great tour of the facility — it was massive; the outdoor area and
open spaces were really, really nice.</p>
<p>We got a brief presentation about their products, which seemed a bit abstract to
me. What it did show me though is that their demographic is a much wider net
than I would have anticipated: they design tooling for a substantial audience —
yes, software engineers, but also datacenter designers, car companies, and many
others.</p>
<p>What was most important was the “fireside” chat afterwards; an open Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>We met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevinkranzusch/">Kevin Kranzusch</a>, one
of the first employees at NVIDIA,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/triantos/">Nick Triantos</a>, VP of software, and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarahyurick/">Sarah Yurick</a>, a recent case grad now
working on <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/products/nemo/">NeMo</a>,
and a few others.</p>
<p>Some key points from NVIDIA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their culture has <strong>not</strong> really changed over time. They really value
intellectual honesty. I remember back to when I was starting my first batch at
<a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, their introduction stresses the
importance of being “kind” instead of “nice,” a similar idea: being honest and
upfront over obscurative and always reinforcing.</li>
<li>Being well rounded is important. Kevin talked about how Nvidia hasn’t really
had major “Pivot”s, but that they do have to adapt. Something unique about a
company their size is that they can invest in R&amp;D in speculative fields to
try to keep ahead of competition.</li>
<li>The best types of industries to go into are the ones with “insatiable” desire.
Easier said than done.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their actual work seemed to be very sharded. Different people we spoke to would
work on totally different things, and not know much about what others were
working on. I think that, while they value ideas, it seems like just by how
their company flows, this “segmentation” may make it hard to contribute
substantially as any given employee.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they seem to treat their employees really well. They talked
about how there’s a lot of respect for ideas and asking for help, which is
always good to hear. Because of the specificity of what employees work on, it
also seems to be the case that everyone is really interested in what they’re
working on. They are for sure solving some revolutionary technical problems.</p>
<h3 id="rivian">Rivian</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/20241025041716.png" alt="Rivian Presentation"/></p>
<p>Between Nvidia and Google, we visited
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/rivian">Rivian</a>, another totally different
experience.</p>
<p>At Rivian we got a presentation on the EV industry, what the sorts of products
they work on are, and an overview of the challenges they are facing and how they
want to grow in the future.</p>
<p>I found a few things neat about Rivian</p>
<ul>
<li>The idea that you sell an “experience” with the car. This sort of “buying into
an experience” idea is something I’ve come across a lot over recent years. I
don’t totally buy the value that turning conventional goods into “experiences”
adds. But I understand the idea.</li>
<li>Their CI/CD process sounded very technically interesting. They’re
automatically pushing software updates to cars, so they have to have a pretty
complex testing setup, and they talked about how they have stripped down
hardware specifically for testing. I wish I could’ve asked more questions
about their integration testing.</li>
<li>It’s helpful to break down problems into specific concrete steps you can take
to solve them.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wish we had more time to chat, but we were crunched on time since they had a
relatively long technical presentation. I think that the most valuable insights
have come from the loose conversations we’ve had during the trip.</p>
<p>I’m still really curious how it’s possible Rivian is able to maintain such low
(negative) profit margins and operate at such a high loss, it seems like a
dangerous recipe that surely must be intentional. It’s an interesting stance on
the side of the value of speed. The auto industry is definitely very capital
intensive, and I feel like that fact can induce inefficiency.</p>
<h3 id="google">Google</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/20241025041749.png" alt="Google discussion"/></p>
<p>At first, I expected Google to share some resemblance with NVDIA. It’s a massive
company, with a ton of employees, and a ton of projects, too. They’re both
leaders in their industries.</p>
<p>But Google’s really, really, different.</p>
<p>Just as we walked in to Google, the aesthetic was extremely eccentric, with
unique architecture and bright Google colors.</p>
<p>We met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gopikallayil/">Gopi Kallayil</a>, chief
business strategist and AI evangelist, and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramgopal/">TT Ramgopal</a>, head of android relations.</p>
<p>I was particularly excited to talk to TT about Android, but we were really
crammed for time and I decided it best not to get bogged down in a super
technical discussion. I’ll have to reach out on linked in to begin the
discussion on android devtools! My big takeaway from what TT had to say was how
rampant competition is at all levels, even at the scales of Google; the
importance of looking into the future to predict the battles of the future.</p>
<p>Gopi had a really great personality, and the passion you could feel he had was
really incredible. He talked about Google AI, and how <em>vast</em>/general its
potential may be. What’s unique about Google is how broad their impact is,
because of how massive their audience is. I think that’s pretty cool.</p>
<p>What Gopi said that I more personally resonate with, and I’ve now been much more
conscious of is battling the tendency to complete other people’s sentences. Not
necessarily cutting people off, but overcoming the inclination to “autocomplete”
people’s train of thought, and then losing attention of the actual things
they’re communicating. To be honest, I definitely feel I sometimes tend to do
this, and I think that being aware of it and more deeply listening is great
general advice.</p>
<p>I think one of the unique things about Google is how empowering the culture is.
This is something that I’ve really never sensed to the degree I did at Google,
and is probably why I know so many Recursers who were also ex-Googlers. It seems
like Google encourages employees to ideate and explore beyond their specific
area of work. There’s some tangible ways that they mentioned they do this.</p>
<p>I fear working at “mega” companies because I’m worried that I’ll be trapped into
doing work that I have little control over, and that my impact will be
necessarily small in scope of the work that the company does, but Google seems
to truly care about what areas you are interested in, so you can focus your
energy on what matters.</p>
<h3 id="y-combinator">Y-Combinator</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/20241025041821.png" alt="Discussion"/>
<img src="https://static.404wolf.com/20241025041842.png" alt="Space tour"/></p>
<p>On Tuesday, we visited Y Combinator and got to hear from
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petekoomen/">Pete Koomen</a> about his journey.</p>
<p>Pete was one of the original founders of
<a href="https://www.optimizely.com">optimizely</a>, an A/B testing platform designed to be
easy to use even for non developers to set up tests.</p>
<p>This is in a similar arena to the sorts of things I’m interested in, and I found
it really interesting to hear about his journey. He was also inspired to start
the company out of frustration with problems that he’d experienced as an
engineer.</p>
<p>What’s cool about his role at YC is that he gets to experience working with a
lot of different start ups all at once.</p>
<p>Some themes were</p>
<ul>
<li>What makes a good founder. Being very resourceful, learning things quickly,
and never making the same mistake twice.</li>
<li>Running towards risk. Finding hard problems and solving them. This isn’t
necessarily required for success, but it seems to enable much vaster success.</li>
<li>Try to find customers as early as possible. Sean at Fountain also noted this,
and I definitely see the value.</li>
</ul>
<p>I agreed with most of what he had to say. There’s a pattern I’ve seen throughout
the trip on how heavily to fund ventures. There seems to not be a clear cut
answer — some people, perhaps particularly YC, feel that it’s important for
there to be an aspect of scarcity; by not having huge amounts of funding you use
what you have much more efficiently. On the other hand, companies like Rivian
take a totally opposite approach, and raise substantial amounts of money to try
to grow very quickly. My thought is that you <em>can</em> put a price on speed, but
sometimes it’s not a price worth paying.</p>
<h3 id="giant">Giant</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/https://static.404wolf.com/VealeSnyderReflection-20241025172611110.webp" alt="John @ Giant"/></p>
<p>Finally, we met with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johndkobs/">John Kobs</a>. At
most of the places that we visited, we would give brief 2 minute introductions
about ourselves, but with John, he told us to “talk about our most recent
failure.”</p>
<p>I found this meaningful, because it got us to <em>think</em> about why we failed and
how we could prevent it from happening again. Being conscientious about it
seemed key. I recalled how a few weeks ago I feel I did poorly in a Go debugging
interview because I entered it with the wrong mindset and didn’t fully <em>analyze
the situation</em>: they wanted to see how I understood the adjacent concept to the
thing I was debugging, but I was laser focused on getting the test to pass.</p>
<p>He went on to lead an extremely insightful Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>The biggest takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learning from mistakes. Never making the same mistake twice seems like a
generally good piece of advice.</li>
<li>Recognizing bottlenecks, but transitioning carefull. He created what became
Apartments List. He talked about how he saw how being an aggregator of
aggregators was a bottleneck to scale, and how they needed to pivot to work
with brokers themselves. This pivot initially was extremely painful, beyond
expectation.</li>
<li>Being open. This is something that came up at Google too. Instead of being
overly prescriptive, listening to others and thinking through things without
the underlying assumption that there’s nothing left to figure out or learn.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chats">Chats</h2>
<p>There were two networking events during the trip. There, there were a bunch of
Case alums and people affiliated with Case.</p>
<p>During the second event, I got to speak to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> himself; the creator
of Tex and writer of 30+ books, including <em>The Art Of Computer Programming</em>. The
chat reminded me a bit of some interviews with Linux Turvals that I watched a
few years back. There’s the debate between whether the right way to delve into
CS is top down or bottom up; whether to start with high level languages and the
ergonomics of abstraction, or to jump into registers, boolean algebra, and C. I
personally don’t think that it’s a one size fits all topic, but Donald talked
about how he think’s its imperative that you learn how things work, and how
abstractions can quickly become very dangerous. I think there’s value to that
train of thought. By the time I got to ask him about his thoughts on
<a href="http://typst.app">typst</a>, a Tex competitor, it was clear what his opinion would
be — its ergonomics are a dangerous disguise. But I think it’s fine for the
application. Another really important topic was writing — we both agree that
it’s really important to write about what you do and think. This includes non
technical writing, like this post!</p>
<p>In the second networking session of the trip, I got to chat with
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/schahn/">Stephen Hahn</a>. We had some great technical
conversation, and he talked about how he’d avoided tool related start ups
(probably my most specific interest). When I asked why, it was pretty
straightforward: it’s hard to sell tools. Big companies will often release them
for free and crush you, or it is just technically difficult to provide them in a
way that requires payment. My interest is in bridging fullstack with developer
tooling, and he seemed to agree that the idea of web based tooling is an
interesting new category that may enable tooling related startups that may
previously not have been possible.</p>
<p>I had a ton of other really great chats, and I’ll try to post some more
reflections here over the next few days.</p>

<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/https://static.404wolf.com/VealeSnyderReflection-20241025150445254.webp" alt=""/></p>
<p>Throughout the trip, I really felt the value of time. Being able to pack
questions into such short sessions, and make meaningful connections with the
execs and engineers that we met, seemed almost impossible. Time in general seems
like one of the biggest limiting factors, and in general I tend to agree with
Sean in how vital efficiency is.</p>
<p>One important insight was how it’s important to be able to adapt to and embrace
change rapidly. Speed is imperative, but sometimes overpriced. Efficiency is
important too. There’s a lingering question of how important it is to balance
speed and quality, and being careful not to over complicate things (something I,
and other engineers are particularly vulnerable to), is something I want to be
more attentive to.</p>
<p>“Good” culture seems like it can make or break a company, but it can often be
largely immutable. Some companies value efficiency, some intellectual honesty,
some curiosity, etc. I really liked the culture
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">Google</a> was targeting in particular; even in
such a large company, they care that you contribute to specific things you care
about. The power of “passion” for your work is massive.</p>
<p>Also, being open-minded and carefully considering others’ ideas is always
important. Specifically, deeply considering everyone’s ideas, and, in the
context of startups, close contact with clients. I found
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#">Sean Behr</a>’s thoughts on the danger of data
abstraction inspiring — charts and summaries can mask critical insights;
anecdotes are often most valuable.</p>
<p>The trip also placed a huge emphasis on the power of networking. I think
sometimes networking takes on too formal a connotation — but really, it’s all
about meeting and then staying in touch with an ever increasing amount of
awesome, interesting people. I’ve always found that the most powerful “network”
links are bidirectional, and in that way it’s like making friends.</p>
<p>Michael Goldberg is a big proponent of LinkedIn as a powerful networking tool,
and it’s absolutely true that I’ll be able to stay in touch with a lot of the
people that I met over the trip there. It’s a really great tool. But I think
there’s a pretty significant personal aspect that’s lost. It’s an amazing tool
to connect with and organize a network. But I think that LinkedIn is, perhaps
reasonably so, somewhat superficial. It feels a bit out of place to post a real,
thoughtful digest of things like this trip, in the form of a LinkedIn post,
because of the context that it’s placed in. Hopefully my insights here are
useful and interesting. I’d love to chat further if you have any additional
comments or thoughts! Email me at <a href="mailto:wolf@404wolf.com">wolf@404wolf.com</a>, or 212/767/9653.</p>

<p>The second major part of the Veale Snyder fellowship is an international trip,
with the same group as the first trip. For my year, we visited the Czech
Republic (including a day in Austria)! We went on a lot of walking tours — of
Vienna, Brono, and Prague. It was in some ways a really unique and different
experience, but in others bared many similarities to places in the US.</p>
<p>We went to Brno because our professor thought that Brno has various similarities
to Cleveland. I think this is true in some ways, but I wouldn’t really draw the
comparison. I didn’t find Brno very dense, it felt somewhat like busier towns in
NJ — not really a city, but also not really suburban. My favorite part of the
trip was definitely visiting Prague, I think it bore many more similarities to
NYC than Cleveland to Brno.</p>
<p>The second half of the program is lead by Michael Hill, former Medtronic CTO.
What I like about Michael is that all of his advice is very practical, and his
answers and thoughts are very to the point. Michael’s shared a lot of insights,
but there’s some that particularly have stood out to me</p>
<ul>
<li>During one of our lunches Michael talked about his decision to stay at
Medtronic so long (almost 30 years!), and it boiled down to loving your boss,
and aligning with your companies interests. These things sound obvious, and I
agree with them — but it is powerful to be able to pinpoint it directly.</li>
<li>It’s really important to keep focused: on a specific audience, on your
company’s trajectory, mission, etc. Being clear and strategic is critical to
success.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-makes-an-innovator">What makes an Innovator?</h2>
<p>The Veale Snyder program for the second half of the semester is taught as a 3
credit course. The course Syllabus leaves a few ongoing questions for us to
think about:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is innovation? What does it mean to be an innovator?</li>
<li>What is entrepreneurship? What does it mean to be an entrepreneur?</li>
<li>What is a “value proposition” and why does it matter?</li>
<li>What mindset, skills, and tools are required for success in innovation (to be
an entrepreneur)?</li>
</ol>
<p>And then, after our trip, asks us to reflect on the first question, “What makes
an innovator?”</p>
<p>It’s a subjective, multifaceted question. So here’s the evolution of my thoughts
on it—</p>
<p>Before the trip, we read <em>The Medici Effect</em>: “what elephants and epidemics can
teach us about innovation.” I’d say it sums up pretty easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Intersection</em> is a unique space that’s created only when people of
diverse backgrounds and interests, are brought together over a thread of
commonality.</li>
<li>When you have an <em>Intersection</em>, you can achieve <em>The Medici Effect</em>. <em>The
Medici Effect</em> is named after the Medici family from Florence, a wealthy
banking family who played a significant role in funding the Renaissance by
funding a large variety of very different creative artisans. It describes the
big results you can get by fostering <em>Intersection</em>s.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also read <em>The Innovator Mindset</em> Some takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>All products have target customers, and the target customer is never
“everyone.” Identifying the people you’re serving is critical to success.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Innovation is about people and their assumptions and subconscious thought
patterns (a.k.a. their mindset) and their daily actions and habits that stem
from that mindset (a.k.a. their behavior). Put all those together, add some
procedures, rewards and penalties, social dynamics, unspoken rules—and a pinch
of stress—and you get a wonderfully messy, organic, and complex environment.
An environment in which behavior, not lip service (although words are also
important), drives the results. If you fail to address that daily behavior,
even the greatest strategy and plan to drive innovation are doomed to fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> for me has one of the most impactful
experiences of my life because, I think, of how it neatly conforms to the
<em>Medici Effect</em>’s <em>Intersection</em>. The entire RC space is a carefully curated
environment of serendipity and diversity. Theres a large variety of people from
all different backgrounds. I’ve done pair programming with ML engineers, Art
Historians, quant developers, and more. And, there’s a closed space where
everyone is packed together. This exposes you to so many different projects and
thought processes; when directly pair programming with people, during lunch
discussions, or group meetings.</p>
<p>Creating a space of innovation to drive entrepreneurship I think requires a lot
of similar components, which Czechia is trying to cultivate. It’s a difficult
process, though, because, as we’ve talked about a lot in our class, mindset is
one of the most important factors. You can have a very accessible
entrepreneurial environment (creating serendipity, providing spaces and
resources, general access to funding, etc), which is one side of the puzzle and
something that they haven’t nailed yet, but there’s also a component of
convincing people that it’s worth it in the first place. If people are content
with work, like what they do, and are happy with where the amount they earn gets
them, it is difficult to convince them to channel their ideas into startups —
it’s a risk that people aren’t internally justifying taking.</p>
<h3 id="bit-entrepreneurial-panel">BIT Entrepreneurial Panel</h3>
<p>A panel of speakers answering the question “Does Brno region need an
Entrepreneurial Ecosystem?”</p>
<p>At first, I’d thought that this was a rhetorical question, but the more we
focused on it the more it seems that it’s really a matter goals. When asked why
Brno might want Entrepreneurship, the answer seemed to mostly be about freedom
and self dependence, largely aligned with American values. The appeal seems to
be largely that entrepreneurship can provide the city with more security and
independence. Brno’s economy and workforce is largely dependent on electron
microscopes. We toured ThermoFisher Scientific’s manufacturing facility, and the
level of sophistication and and intelligence there is really incredible.
ThermoFisher makes up a disproportionate share of Brno’s GDP, and so it makes
sense that they would want to foster entrepreneurship to diversify.</p>
<p>During the trip we got to interact with some local students at BUT’s
entrepreeneurship school, and got to speak with them about what their
educational experience has been. We also visited BUT’s maker lab, and Strojlab,
their maker space. Czech academics seems much more rigid — there’s much less
time spent outside of classes, and there’s not real choice over the classes you
take. There’s a lot of similar factors—Brno is somewhat of a “college town,”
with about 20% of the population being students, and apparently it was common
that students would go home for the weekend. I think this more traditional style
of instruction provides more consistency, but that that’s not necessarily a good
thing.</p>
<p>We also visited Charles University, to learn about how they support
entrepreneurship, and it seemed their focus was also largely environment, and
their approaches were also more traditional; a lot of importance was placed on
creating serendipitous spaces, networking opportunities, and preserving a
specific reputation/brand. The difficulty seemed similar to that of many of the
other places we visited: trying to motivate students to actually care about
entrepreneurship. It seemed like a lot of people were more focused on academics
for the sake of academics and thought of vocation interests as just that — the
students we spoke to had interesting ideas and were very interesting to learn
from, but I felt they had a less clear sense of their “passion”s, and were more
focused on <em>path</em>s.</p>
<h3 id="czech-invest">Czech Invest</h3>
<p>During our trip, we went to a “Czech Invest” presentation at
<a href="https://www.americkecentrum.cz/en/">The American Center</a> at the US embassy. My
takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a lot of legal challenges that Czech startups face. You can’t really
pay people in equity, and there’s weird unfavorable tax intensives</li>
<li>Entrepreneurship isn’t something baked into the culture, and it’s not really
taught very often (although that seems like it’s slowly changing) (and, adding
on, change in general seems relatively slow)</li>
<li>The intensives are placed in ways that are more favorable to larger businesses
and less so to start ups</li>
<li>One big inhibitor seems like the “failure is bad” mindset. People don’t want
to make mistakes, so they don’t take as many risks. Growing up, I’ve always
been told to make mistakes to learn from them, but I don’t think that’s
something that’s stressed in Czechia.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jic-entrepreneurship-center">JIC Entrepreneurship Center</h3>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/VealeSnyderReflection20250328021818169.webp" alt=""/></p>
<p>At JIC we met Czech entrepreneur Libor Horeni who shared his experiences with
us. He talked about starting with his first company
<a href="http://toprecepty.cz/">Top Recepty.cz</a>, sharing how he was inspired to create
the website while in high school, from looking through most visited websites in
Czechia and trying to find areas where he could make improvements. He found a
recipe sharing website that got a huge amount of traffic, and thought that he
could recreate it better. After Top Recepty, he talked about a company like
(America’s) Too Good to Go — a company that reduces food waste by connecting
restaurants with customers to pick up their leftover food at a greatly reduced
cost at the end of the day.</p>
<p>What I think made Libor such an effective entrepreneur was not just his true
passion for what he does — he admitted that he doesn’t really cook himself —
but the process. It seems like there’s a lot of different factors that draw
people to entrepreneurship, and it can vary a lot person to person. In SF, it
seemed like the primary motivators were value creation, and money. But in
Czechia it was quite different — in general the people innovating were more
concerned on the common good and improving their community, going down paths
that they wanted to go down. I get the sense that many less “I have no idea
where to start” product ideas come to fruition because people want to reapply
what they do to new contexts for different reasons.</p>
<p>This is certainty not a <em>bad</em> thing per se, but it fosters a different type of
entrepreneurship. Libor talked about how in growing Top Recepty, he reached out
to a lot of Czech grandmothers, trying to curate blog posts; he talked about how
he got companies to sponsor him with pots to give away for competitions to grow
his platform. Here, I don’t think people would feel the need to ask for
permission to repost recipes, and people would be more inclined to pursue more
direct forms of marketing.</p>
<p>His general model seemed to be to find existing products, and refine them to
compete, leveraging their niche market in Czechia. That strategy seemed very
effective in Czechia, but I feel that in the US that there’s not many <em>tech</em>
ideas left to pull in from abroad and refine, and that most of the products we
already have already are well refined; more importance is placed on original
ideas.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/https://static.404wolf.com/e23c532d-7d7a-4203-aeb6-dd08b8733fb5.webp" alt="Entrepreneurship Roundtable"/></p>
<p>We had a roundtable event at Brno University of Tech (BUT) with Michael Goldberg
and a a variety of experts on whether and why the South Moravian region needs
more entrepreneurship. I love playing devils advocate, and I was curious at
trying to grasp exactly why all of these experts seemed to agree that the answer
was yes</p>
<ul>
<li>America is often idolized for entrepreneurial success, and it seems like this
strongly affects entrepreneurial sentiment abroad. they seemed to have a
strong association between entrepreneurship and <em>freedom</em>. There’s a fear that
in Czechia (and even more so Europe as a whole), people are significantly more
dependent on the government than in the US. One of the perks that Czechia
officials consistently mentioned is the general political and economic
stability of the country. By fostering entrepreneurship, Czechia fosters more
self sufficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think it’s important to note though, that, while it does seem like Czechia
struggles to foster an environment that can cultivate entrepreneurial mindsets
and actually produce global startups, I don’t that needs to be a “bad” thing; it
just isn’t a primary focus. Prague was still a beautiful and very energetic (and
historical) city with what felt like more of an industrial focus than, say, NYC.
In lue of the massive entrepreneurial focus of big US cities, there was more of
a focus on everyday quality of life.</p>  </div> </astro-slot></div></div>
