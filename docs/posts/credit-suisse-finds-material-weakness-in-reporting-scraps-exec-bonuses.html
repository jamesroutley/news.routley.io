      The embattled Swiss lender also said chairman Axel Lehmann had proposed to “voluntarily waive” a share award worth 1.5 million Swiss francs ($1.6 million) for the 2022-2023 financial year, given the firm’s “poor financial performance.”

      The board concluded that the “material weakness could result in misstatements of account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual financial statements of Credit Suisse,” the annual report said. Credit Suisse is urgently developing a “remediation plan” to strengthen controls.

      Customers withdrew billions from Credit Suisse last year, contributing to the bank’s biggest annual loss since the financial crisis in 2008. The stock has plunged 67% over the past 12 months.

      The health of the bank’s finances is once again under the microscope following the demise of SVB and spillover effects on global financial markets.

      Despite the fallout from SVB’s collapse, Credit Suisse saw “material good inflows” Monday, according to CEO Ulrich Körner.

      “So far it’s calm,” he said in an interview on Bloomberg TV Tuesday. Outflows from the bank had “significantly moderated” after customers withdrew 111 billion francs ($122 billion) in the three months to December, Körner added<strong>. </strong>The annual report painted a similar picture, saying outflows had not yet reversed by the end of last year.

      Körner said the collapse of SVB was “somewhat of an isolated problem.” Credit Suisse follows “materially different and higher standards when it comes to capital funding, liquidity and so on,” he added.
