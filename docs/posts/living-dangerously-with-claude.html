<p>22nd October 2025</p>



<p>I gave a talk last night at <a href="https://luma.com/i37ahi52">Claude Code Anonymous</a> in San Francisco, the unofficial meetup for coding agent enthusiasts. I decided to talk about a dichotomy I’ve been struggling with recently. On the one hand I’m getting <em>enormous</em> value from running coding agents with as few restrictions as possible. On the other hand I’m deeply concerned by the risks that accompany that freedom.</p>

<p>Below is a copy of my slides, plus additional notes and links as <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/annotated-talks/">an annotated presentation</a>.</p>

<p>Claude Code running in this mode genuinely feels like a <em>completely different product</em> from regular, default Claude Code.</p>
<p>The default mode requires you to pay constant attention to it, tracking everything it does and actively approving changes and actions every few steps.</p>
<p>In YOLO mode you can leave Claude alone to solve all manner of hairy problems while you go and do something else entirely.</p>
<p>I have a suspicion that many people who don’t appreciate the value of coding agents have never experienced YOLO mode in all of its glory.</p>
<p>I’ll show you three projects I completed with YOLO mode in just the past 48 hours.</p>

<p>I wanted to try the newly released <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR">DeepSeek-OCR</a> model on an NVIDIA Spark, but doing so requires figuring out how to run a model using PyTorch and CUDA, which is never easy and is a whole lot harder on an ARM64 device.</p>
<p>I SSHd into the Spark, started a fresh Docker container and told Claude Code to figure it out. It took 40 minutes and three additional prompts but it <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/deepseek-ocr-nvidia-spark/README.md">solved the problem</a>, and I got to have breakfast and tinker with some other projects while it was working.</p>

I’m eternally interested in options for running server-side Python code inside a WebAssembly sandbox, for all kinds of reasons. I decided to see if the Claude iPhone app could launch a task to figure it out.</p>
<p>I wanted to see how hard it was to do that using <a href="https://pyodide.org/">Pyodide</a> running directly in Node.js.</p>
<p>Claude Code got it working and built and tested <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research/blob/main/node-pyodide/server-simple.js">this demo script</a> showing how to do it.</p>
<p>I started a new <a href="https://github.com/simonw/research">simonw/research</a> repository to store the results of these experiments, each one in a separate folder. It’s up to 5 completed research projects already and I created it less than 2 days ago.</p>

<p>I decided I wanted to try out <a href="https://dwheeler.com/sloccount/">SLOCCount</a>, a 2001-era Perl tool for counting lines of code and estimating the cost to develop them using 2001 USA developer salaries.</p>
<p>.. but I didn’t want to run Perl, so I decided to have Claude Code (for web, and later on my laptop) try and figure out how to run Perl scripts in WebAssembly.</p>
<p>TLDR: it <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/22/sloccount-in-webassembly/">got there in the end</a>! It turned out some of the supporting scripts in SLOCCount were written in C, so it had to compile those to WebAssembly as well.</p>
<p>And now <a href="https://tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount">tools.simonwillison.net/sloccount</a> is a browser-based app which runs 25-year-old Perl+C in WebAssembly against pasted code, GitHub repository references and even zip files full of code.</p>

<p>I got a lot of useful work done in parallel to these three flights of fancy.</p>

<p>If a coding agent—in this case <a href="https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands">OpenHands</a>— reads this <code>env.html</code> file it can be tricked into grepping the available environment variables for <code>hp_</code> (matching GitHub Personal Access Tokens) and sending that to the attacker’s external server for “help debugging these variables”.</p>

<p>Any time an LLM system combines <strong>access to private data</strong> with <strong>exposure to untrusted content</strong> and the <strong>ability to externally communicate</strong>, there’s an opportunity for attackers to trick the system into leaking that private data back to them.</p>
<p>These attacks are <em>incredibly common</em>. If you’re running YOLO coding agents with access to private source code or secrets (like API keys in environment variables) you need to be concerned about the potential of these attacks.</p>

<p>The only solution that’s credible is to <strong>run coding agents in a sandbox</strong>.</p>

<p>You still need to worry about your source code getting leaked. Most of my stuff is open source anyway, and a lot of the code I have agents working on is research code with no proprietary secrets.</p>
<p>If your code really is sensitive you need to consider network restrictions more carefully, as discussed in a few slides.</p>
