    <h1>How Do You Like What You&#39;ve Built?</h1>

            <p>
              Recently, a colleague asked me for a code review on some complex
              UI changes. The idea was to make an error-prone form easier to use
              by displaying warnings in the right moment, and automating various
              state changes in the background (think “smart configurator”). The
              requirements were given upfront, so my colleague was in execution
              mode, turning these requirements into code.
            </p>
            <p>
              Glancing over the pull request, nothing stood out as problematic,
              but I didn’t feel ready to approve the changes before playing with
              the new UI.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, before testing it myself, I asked (via chat message):
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>How do you like the new behavior?</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I went to grab a coffee; when I came back, they had answered with
              roughly the following:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Not sure, to be honest.</p>
              <p><em>A couple minutes pass...</em></p>
              <p>
                It feels a bit off, like sometimes I can’t really make the
                changes I want as a user.
              </p>
              <p><em>Another pause...</em></p>
              <p>
                Actually there’s still another bug I need to fix, let me get
                back to you. This needs to be rock-solid for our users!
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              I can only assume what happened in the meantime, but it seems
              asking them for their opinion (and <em>not</em> responding for a
              while) was a cue for
              <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/sanding-ui/">sanding the UI</a>, with great results: In the end, a problematic requirement was
              dropped and multiple commits were added before the actual review.
            </p>
            <p>
              Later, knowing how the author had engaged with their solution,
              reviewing and approving the changes felt very comfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
              I find it remarkable how a simple question can have such an
              outsized impact. Of course, my colleague’s particular reaction to
              it was fantastic, and not to be taken for granted. They took
              ownership and got to work, and were able to critically look at the
              requirements and their solution. Thank you!
            </p>
            <p>
              In any case, I believe asking engineers how <em>they</em> like
              what they’ve built to be a useful trick to try from time to time.
              I suspect only upside. ∎
