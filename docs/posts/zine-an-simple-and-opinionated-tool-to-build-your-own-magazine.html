<p>Many children not only like to build, they also like to knock things down – to hear the complicated noises and watch so many things move at once.</p>
<p>Let’s imagine a sibling agent to <a href="https://donnywinston.com/posts/the-world-of-blocks/"><em>Builder</em></a> called <em>Wrecker</em>, whose specialty is knocking things down:</p>

<p>Suppose <em>Wrecker</em> gets aroused, but there’s nothing in sight to smash. Then <em>Wrecker</em> will have to get some help – by putting <em>Builder</em> to work, for example.</p>
<p>But what if, at some later time, <em>Wrecker</em> considers the tower to be high enough to smash, while <em>Builder</em> wants to make it taller still? Who could settle that dispute?</p>
<p>Is the decision left to <em>Wrecker</em>, who activated <em>Builder</em> in the first place? What if both were activated by a higher-level agent, <em>Play-with-Blocks</em>? What if that agent in turn was activated by a <em>Play</em> agent, who may be in conflict with <em>Eat</em> and <em>Sleep</em>?</p>

<p>A child’s play is not an isolated thing. It always happens in the context of other real-life concerns. Whatever we may chose to do, there are always other things we’d also like to do.</p>
<p>In single-thread, synchronous computer programming, prolonged conflict may be avoided. A function A may call another function B in its body and wait for B to return. If B encounters trouble, it can raise an exception for A to catch. The chain of command for conflict resolution can be clear.</p>
<p>In the case of asynchronous, independent agents like <em>Builder</em> and <em>Wrecker</em>, what is the effect of prolonged conflict? Perhaps the conflict tends to weaken their mutual superior, <em>Play-with-Blocks</em>. In turn, this could reduce <em>Play-with-Blocks</em>’s ability to suppress <em>its</em> rivals. Next, if that conflict isn’t settled soon, it could weaken <em>Play</em> at the next-highest level. Then, <em>Eat</em> or <em>Sleep</em> might seize control.</p>
