    <h1>Ask HN: Anyone Using Augmented Reality, VR, Glasses, Helmets etc. in Industry?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Since Google Glass made its debut in 2012, there&#39;s been a fair amount of hype around augmented reality and related tech coming into its own in industry, presumably enhancing worker productivity and capabilities.</p><p>But I&#39;ve heard and seen so little use in any industries. I would have thought at a minimum that having access to hands-free information retrieval (e.g. blueprints, instructions, notes, etc), video chat and calls for point-of-view sharing, etc would be quite useful for a number of industries. There do seem to be interesting pilot trials involving Hololens in US defense (IVAS) as well as healthcare telemonitoring in Serbia.</p><p>Do you know of any relevant examples or use cases, or are you a user yourself? What do you think are the hurdles - actual usefulness, display quality, cost, something else?</p></div></div></div>
