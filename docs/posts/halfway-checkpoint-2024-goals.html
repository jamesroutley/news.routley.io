    <h1>Halfway checkpoint, 2024 Goals</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the beginning of the year, I wrote <a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/post/731">Goals for 2024</a>. It&#39;s amazing to me it has been over six months since I wrote that. It makes me realize how much time passes and how easily it is to forget things, or drop habits when something comes up.</p>
<p>My goals were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a public culture consumption diary</li>
<li>Blog once a month</li>
<li>Finish locative garden</li>
<li>Make music once a week</li>
<li>Go fishing once a month</li>
<li>30 minutes of exercise three times a week</li>
<li>Remove all credit card debt</li>
<li>Find a monthly in person social thing</li>
</ul>
<p>It all seemed so reasonable! Some progress has been made, but also some stuff has definitely slipped.</p>
<p>Lets group these into to category and take a look at them:</p>
<h2 id="writing-keep-a-public-culture-consumption-diary-blog-once-a-month-finish-locative-garden">Writing: Keep a public culture consumption diary, Blog once a month, Finish locative garden.</h2>
<p>My friend Sumana has been a huge help here, she and I have been meeting roughly once a week to write over video-conference. I&#39;ve made a lot of progress on locative, blogged a little and I had a stint where I was regularly posting<!-- --> <a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/tag/happy">#happy</a> posts.</p>
<p>So by the numbers: In six months, I did two of six full blog posts. I also posted<!-- --> <a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/tag/happy">#happy</a> posts 11 out of 26 weeks.</p>
<h2 id="mental-health-make-music-once-a-week-go-fishing-once-a-month-30-minutes-of-exercise-three-times-a-week-find-a-monthly-in-person-social-thing">Mental Health: Make music once a week, Go fishing once a month, 30 minutes of exercise three times a week, Find a monthly in person social thing</h2>
<p>For the fishing and exercise portions, I had fits and spurts. I messed up my ankle at one point due to not stretching well, which made walking very difficult for about two months. But I did go fishing a few times, and I had weeks where I regularly did exercise. Also a lot of weeks where I didn&#39;t. Lately Mel and I have been walking after dinner, which has been a good forcing function.</p>
<p>Music making has been much more of a success story. I&#39;m pretty regularly making music once a week. Even if it&#39;s just a quick break before a meeting, having a little music station right next to my work desk has been great. I&#39;m occasionally posting some of my practice on YouTube. For example, the other night I posted <a href="https://youtu.be/rVa75atfe3E?si=BAZsHIJS8tU2ZJPd">this little riff</a> I discovered before bed.</p>
<p>I just recently found a monthly social thing though! Shout out to all of the friends and acquaintances who sent suggestions: <a href="https://www.midhudsontroutunlimited.org/">Trout Unlimited Mid-Hudson</a>, <a href="https://luckdragon.space/event/sound.html">Sound</a>, <a href="https://donnaminkowitz.com/lit-lit/">Lit Lit</a> and <a href="https://soyrosendale.com/event/club-draw-session-25/">Club Draw</a>.</p>
<p>While they are all super interesting, and I went to some of those events, the real winner for me was finding the <a href="https://gunksgamingguild.com/">Gunks Gaming Guild</a> in New Paltz. Their website kind of sucks, but I happened to join their discord, and a whole world was opened up. A ton of people looking for D&amp;D players, board game aficionados, etc. So I&#39;ve now played a few D&amp;D sessions there, and it&#39;s been a great social outlet. I&#39;m going to keep looking and trying some of the other events I mentioned, but I feel like I&#39;m making progress.</p>
<h2 id="finances-remove-all-credit-card-debt">Finances: Remove all credit card debt</h2>
<p>We made some progress on this, but not much. Here&#39;s to the back half of the year.</p>
<h2 id="other-stuff">Other stuff</h2>
<p>Work continues to be very stressful. Depending on the day it&#39;s either fantastic or infuriating. Our Quarterly get together is next week though, so I&#39;m hopeful it relives some of the stress.</p>
<p>Mel moves to London in September for a year to attend the London School of Economics for a masters in Criminal Justice Policy. So getting my mental health habits in place and sticking to them will be super important.</p>
<p>That&#39;s about it! I hope you are doing well wherever you are. Lots of love from the east coast.</p>
<p>/Nat</p></div></div>
