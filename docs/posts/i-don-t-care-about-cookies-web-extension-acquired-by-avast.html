							<p>Dear &#34;I don&#39;t care about cookies&#34; users,</p>
							
							<p>After exactly 10 years of maintaining this project and dealing with cookie/GDPR pop-ups on my own, I am proud and happy to say that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avast.com/"><img src="https://static3.avast.com/10002399/web/i/v2/components/logos/avast-logos/avast-logo-default.svg" alt="Avast"/></a> - a famous and trustworthy IT company known for the wide range of products that help secure our digital experience, has recognized its value!</p>
							
							<p> <b>Avast</b> offered to acquire the project so that we can help each other in creating even better products and I decided to accept the offer: &#34;I don&#39;t care about cookies&#34; is now officially a member of <b>Avast</b> family ðŸ™‚</p>
							
							<p>I will keep working on the project and the extension will remain free to use. Donations are not needed anymore to keep the project going, of course. A big, big <span>â™¥ THANK YOU â™¥</span> to all the donors, translators and everyone else who helped keeping the project alive over the years! </p>
							
							<p>Stay tuned for more excited news in the future!</p>
