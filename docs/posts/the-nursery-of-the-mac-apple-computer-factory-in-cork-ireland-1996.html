    <h1>The Nursery of the Mac – Apple Computer factory in Cork, Ireland (1996)</h1>

  <h2>Apple Computer in Cork</h2>
  <p>Ireland is a beautiful holiday destination: green, quiet, beautiful nature, good beer 
    and kind people. But when a Mac-freak like René Ros is on vacation in Ireland he 
    hás to visit the Apple factory in Cork. Armed with lots of RAM memory in the upper 
    chamber and a anti-static heal band he was allowed in.</p>
  <p>The Apple factory in Cork manufactures 25% of all Macintosh computers, almost entirely 
    destined for the European market. However, peripheral devices and monitors aren&#39;t 
    made there. The modern factory is located in a industrial estate in the northeastern 
    part of Cork and is one of the largest employers around. Cork is a large harbor town 
    and has its own international airport. Handy for a factory which works with just-in-time 
    delivery!</p>
  <p>The factory already has existed since 1980 when they assembled Apple II&#39;s. The first 
    Macintosh models were packed by the company with a European keyboard, cables and 
    manuals. The total ground area grown from 3700 m2 to 31.600 m2. The number of employees also increased: from 100 to 1200 á 1600 now.</p>
  <h3>Motherboards</h3>
  <p>The two main departments are those for the manufacturing of motherboards (PCB: Printed Circuit Board) and for the assembly of computers (Systems Operation, &#34;Systems&#34; for short).</p>
  <p><img width="321" height="251" src="http://www.rgaros.nl/computers/apple-cork/inside.jpg" alt="PCB Department (JPEG, 19 Kb)"/></p><p>The PCB department consists of four production-units which turn a printboard into 
    a Macintosh-motherboard.</p>
  <h3>Systems</h3>
  <p>The Systems department then builds a single computer from the separate parts. The 
    so-called assembly is obviously a more labor intensive process: each part is placed 
    and connected manually. Here also the assembly lines, five in total, are almost independent. Most parts are made by other companies, like the metal frame and the housing. 
    &#34;Other companies are much better than we&#34; according the Apple Cork spokesman.</p>
  <h3>Other Departments</h3>
  <p>A separate department with their own assembly-line is the CDM-group (Customer Driven 
    Manufacturing). When an order for a larger number of computers with unusual configurations 
    comes in, this group can make a separate assembly-line for the production. The example given by the guide are a few thousand PowerBooks which were fitted for British 
    Telecom with different modems, memory-configuration and software.</p>
   <p><img width="267" height="164" src="http://www.rgaros.nl/computers/apple-cork/outside.jpg" alt="Main Entrance (JPEG, 6 Kb)"/></p><p>Our short visit to the Macintosh-birthplace was very pleasant. The factory gave an 
    efficient impression, while the atmosphere among the workers seems good and informal. 
    A look into the warehouse wasn&#39;t given to us. Or perhaps the size of it would have 
    given us an impression of inefficiency?  </p>
   <p> The Apple workers enjoyed the sun outside during the lunch break. It was nice holiday 
    weather, but Cork was left as it was because what&#39;s a tourist got to do there?</p>
