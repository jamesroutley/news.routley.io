New puzzles (two) come out each day at midnight (EST / UTC-5), and there’s also a <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard">leaderboard</a> where you can score points if you submit your answers sooner than other folks.</p> <p>I wrote up my solution for the first day of puzzles (both) in Python (3.8) below:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>List</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>However, when I was thinking about what puzzles might look like in the future, a few thoughts came to mind:</p> <ol> <li>How can I come up with solutions to puzzles more quickly?</li> <li>What can I learn from solving these puzzles? a. Maybe I can learn more about a programming language I’m less familiar with? b. Or maybe there are tools that can help me solve these puzzles?</li> <li>How can I stay motivated working with this advent calendar (and have fun)?</li> </ol> <h2 id="in-comes-github-copilot">In comes GitHub Copilot</h2> <p>I remembered that I had an invite to the preview of <a href="https://copilot.github.com/">GitHub Copilot</a>, an AI-based pair programming tool that you can install in Visual Studio Code.</p> <p>I then installed the preview (after updating VSCode), and opened up a new file called <code>copilot_solution.py</code>.</p> <p>When you use Copilot, you can begin by typing code comments or method names that explain what problem you’re trying to solve / what code you want to write, and then Copilot can essentially translate those comments into code.</p> <h2 id="puzzle-one">Puzzle One</h2> <p>So I started by copying a piece of the advent day 1 puzzle description (the first puzzle):</p> <div><div><pre><code><span># count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement.
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>And then began typing:</p>  <p>and Copilot instantly suggested (correct) code for counting the depth measurement changes. I’ve embedded a video below:</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dYh0YEB88Dc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p>And here’s the code Copilot came up with in text format:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span># count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement.
</span>
<span>def</span> <span>get_depth_changes</span><span>(</span><span>depth_list</span><span>):</span>
    <span>&#34;&#34;&#34;
    Count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;</span>
    <span>depth_changes</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>i</span> <span>in</span> <span>range</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>len</span><span>(</span><span>depth_list</span><span>)):</span>
        <span>if</span> <span>depth_list</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>depth_list</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]:</span>
            <span>depth_changes</span> <span>+=</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>depth_changes</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_depth_input</span><span>():</span>
    <span>&#34;&#34;&#34;
    Get the depth measurements from the input file.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;</span>
    <span>depth_list</span> <span>=</span> <span>[]</span>
    <span>with</span> <span>open</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;adventofcode-day1-input.txt&#39;</span><span>)</span> <span>as</span> <span>f</span><span>:</span>

            <span>depth_list</span><span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>(</span><span>line</span><span>))</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>depth_list</span>


<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span>:</span>

    <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>get_depth_changes</span><span>(</span><span>depth_list</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>One particular thing I noticed was that I needed to fully type out <code>def get_depth_input</code> in order to give Copilot the correct context, but it managed to produce working code just from that function signature, and I only wrote and ran this program once.</p> <h2 id="puzzle-two">Puzzle Two</h2> <p>I tried this out with the second puzzle for day 1 as well, which is a generalization of the first puzzle that involves summing up sliding windows of measurements and comparing them.</p> <p>You can find the YouTube video for the second puzzle solved by Copilot below:</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBCsXEqG9hw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> <p>A couple of points on what I noticed about the code completion:</p> <ul> <li>Copilot was able to come up with a generalized method for counting sums of increasing measurements with a <code>window_size</code> parameter, without me specifying the size of the sliding window in the code comments</li> <li>When creating the entrypoint to the program, Copilot somehow assumed the window length for the method call I wanted would be <code>3</code>, without having the context (as far as I can tell) from the user (me)</li> <li>GitHub Copilot has a list of possible solutions to code completions, so I wonder if it’s just luck that the suggested solution was the correct one</li> </ul> <p>Here’s the code written by Copilot:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span># Your goal now is to count the number of times the sum of measurements in this sliding window increases from the previous sum

</code></pre></div></div> <p>I thought this was a fun experiment, so I’m curious to see how far Copilot can go and what it’s limitations are as more puzzles come out each day. I’ll post an update on day 2 or day 3 of the Advent of Code and also try to use more of the puzzle description rather than sentences I think are the most useful for the Copilot program.</p> <p>Thanks for reading!</p> <ul> <li><a href="https://twitter.com/Freddie_V4">Freddie</a></li> </ul>    </div> </div></div>
