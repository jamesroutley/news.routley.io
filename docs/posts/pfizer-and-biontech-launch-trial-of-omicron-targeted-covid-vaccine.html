Another desired feature of an upgraded vaccine would be for it to also protect against other variants of concern, the EMA said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">BioNTech declined to comment on what type of data it was asked to file with regulators.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">It said an analysis of antibodies elicited by its Omicron-targeted booster should help answer whether shots will be needed that address more than one variant at a time. It hopes to show the antibodies neutralise a spectrum of variants.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">&#34;If this is the case a mix would not be required,&#34; it said, adding that it was generating more data to shed light on the issue.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">The European drugs regulator has urged pharmaceutical companies to work on more than one upgraded Omicron shot, including versions that address a combination of variants.<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eu-drugs-watchdog-calls-vaccine-developers-not-rule-out-upgrade-options-2022-01-18/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">The Omicron variant has replaced the Delta variant as the dominant lineage in many parts of the world and Omicron itself is now splitting into different subforms, one of which, BA2, is causing particular concern.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Michael Erman and Ludwig Burger; Editing by Leslie Adler, Kirsten Donovan</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
