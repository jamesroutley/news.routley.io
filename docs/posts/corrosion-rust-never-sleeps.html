flies, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation will begin spreading its annual 1 million tons of rock salt on the roads to melt the snow and ice, thereby hastening the state’s 8 million vehicles on their way to an early grave from rust.</p></figcaption><figcaption><a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2F4e8iesl8k5u51.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener

painting, repainting, re-repainting, and finally discarding.  All that hassle and expense is a strong incentive to devote a great deal of science and engineering to improve the situation.  Thus maintenance issues are the force behind the anti-corrosion part of technological progress.  We want to make rust just go away, and it just won’t.  So we negotiate.</p><p data-block-index="2">Later editions of John Muir’s opus on Volkswagen repair conclude with a section titled “How To Keep Your VW Alive Forever.”  The book emphasizes that the most crucial requirement is to “<em>keep rust at bay</em>.”<sup>1</sup>  Storing the car is no solution because it will suffer from what dealers call “lot rot.”  Since rust thrives in moist conditions, humid climates are deadly.  The most corrosive regions are near the salty moisture in ocean air or on icy roads strewn with salt to make driving safer. <strong> </strong><sub><strong>In America’s humid southeast and freezing northern states, few old VWs can be found still running.  They’ve all rusted out.</strong></sub></p><p data-block-index="3">John Jerome rants in his book <em>Truck</em>, </p><blockquote data-block-index="4">Road salt makes a mushy, corrosive paste that is flung universally about the under- and over-sides of every vehicle.  It fouls all the metal parts, pits windshields, scours paint, and reduces the useful life of north-country motor vehicles by several years.  It also kills roadside trees, pollutes streams and wells, and destroys gardens.<sup>2</sup></blockquote><p data-block-index="5">He wrote that in 1977.  It’s still true.  There must be a way to ensure safe driving in snow that doesn’t destroy every vehicle on the road, but so far all the less harmful substitutes for rock salt, such as sugar beet juice, cost four to ten times more than rock salt’s $60 a ton.</p><p data-block-index="6">People have always agonized about their cars and trucks rusting out.  It used to be said of Model T’s that “on a quiet night, you can hear a Ford rust.”  That’s plausible, according to Jonathan Waldman’s book <em>Rust</em>.  He writes:</p><blockquote data-block-index="7">Because corrosion is exothermic, the skin of a corroding Ford becomes hotter than the metal underlying it, and this thermal gradient generates local stress called electrostriction.  Technically, with the right tools, you really could hear it.<sup>3</sup></blockquote><p data-block-index="8">“Exothermic” means it emits heat.  Rusting is slow fire—an oxidation process that converts iron or steel exposed to air and moisture into iron oxide.  One definition of corrosion describes it as “extractive metallurgy in reverse….  Iron is made from hematite by heating it with carbon.  Iron corrodes and reverts to rust, thus completing its life cycle.  Hematite and rust have the same composition.”<sup>4</sup>  </p><p data-block-index="9">From rust to rust, with civilization along the way.  </p><p data-block-index="10">Metallurgy and civilization ascended together.  Because metals are hard, tough, dense, shiny, recyclable, and—most importantly—shapeable, they proved perfect at first for making prized adornments, tools, and weapons, and later for civilization’s extensive structures, machines, pipes, and fasteners.  Nearly everything made by humans has metal in it.  So many billions of tons of metal are deployed worldwide that its corrosion is a planet-scale expense.  According to a 2016 report by the National Association of Corrosion Engineers, “<strong>The global cost of corrosion is estimated to be US$2.5 trillion a year,</strong> which is equivalent to 3.4 percent of the global Gross Domestic Product.”</p><p data-block-index="11">The report earnestly continues, “By using available corrosion control practices, it is estimated that savings of between 15 and 35% of the cost of corrosion could be realized, i.e., between US$375 and $875 billion annually on a global basis.”<sup>5</sup>   That’s the happy news.  The hard news is what the engineers are admitting: even if every one of their best practices is deployed worldwide, corrosion will <em>still</em> cost the world between 2.2 and 2.9 percent of global GDP—$1.6 to $2.1 trillion.</p><figure><p><img sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 800px" loading="lazy" decoding="async"

Each open rivet hole let more salt-laden water into the spots where the copper skin was attached to the iron armature, hastening galvanic corrosion of the iron.</p></figcaption><figcaption><a href="https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ny1251.color.570025c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jet Lowe, 1984, Library of Congress</a></figcaption></figure><p data-block-index="56">Attempts to deal with the popped rivet holes and the destructive moisture they let in led to a series of stop-gap measures.  In 1911 a coating of coal tar was applied everywhere on the interior to fill in the leaks.  Some of it leaked through the rivet holes and discolored the outside of the statue.  Over the years, eight additional layers of various kinds of paint trapped moisture between the copper and iron and concealed the escalating corrosion.</p><p data-block-index="57">Never paint rust.</p><p data-block-index="58">The extent of the damage only became apparent in 1981 when the findings of a comprehensive investigation were reported.  According to Waldman’s <em>Rust</em> book, the engineers found that “one-third of the statue’s twelve thousand rivets were loose, damaged, or missing, and more or less half of the iron frame had corroded.”<sup>16</sup>  The painted-over problems were so extensive that parts of the statue, such as the upraised arm, were in danger of collapsing.  The statue that was regarded as a symbol of America was now a symbol of decay.  And its centennial celebration, in 1986, was just five years away.</p><p data-block-index="59">Restoring the statue became a matter of national honor.  Committees of public-spirited citizens raised $277 million (about $1.5 billion these days.)  Committees of preservation engineers devised schemes to repair the corrosion damage at a scale never before attempted, and they laid out strategies to keep the statue corrosion-free in the future.  Since the goal was historic <em>preservation</em>, the original copper skin of the statue had to be treated as inviolate.  Scaffolding on the exterior wasn’t allowed even to touch the skin at any point.</p><p data-block-index="60">So they built the world’s tallest free-standing scaffolding—305 feet from the pedestal’s base to the tip of the torch.  When removing the eight layers of paint on the inside of the copper skin proved to be impossible with traditional techniques, the engineers invented a cryogenic solution.  Thirty-five hundred gallons of liquid nitrogen were sprayed on the paint to make it so cold it lost its grip and came off in sheets.  Getting the coal tar off, however, required something even more drastic.  The eventual solution was a combination sandblaster and vacuum cleaner to scour all the copper with 40 tons of baking soda, followed by a complete rinse with vinegar.</p><figure><p><img sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 600px" loading="lazy" decoding="async" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/books-in-progress/image/upload/w_640,c_lfill,f_auto/v1/bip/voy4md4fmh0gqmhdwnbv 640w,
