    <h1>Remembering Cyberia, the First Ever Cyber Cafe</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>


<p>It’s early on a Sunday morning in late 1994, and you’re shuffling your way through Fitzrovia in Central <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/tag/london/">London</a>, bloodstream still rushing after a long night at Bagley’s. The sun comes up as you <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/tag/drugs/">come down</a>. You navigate side streets that you know like the back of your hand. But your hand’s stamped with a party logo. And your brain’s kaput.</p>

<p>Which, if you’re too young to remember, are basically cafes with computers in them. It all began when Eva Pascoe, a Polish computing student living in London, crossed paths with Tim Berners Lee and other early internet mavericks at the dawn of the 90s. “I was very interested in cyberfeminism and wanted to figure out how women could reclaim <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/section/tech/">tech</a>,” she recalls. </p>

<p>The internet was still in its infancy. Diabolically slow dial-up modems only emerged around 1992; the World Wide Web was a pipe dream until 1993 and hardly anyone had the internet at home. But there wasn’t just a lack of javascript; Eva remembers there being no good java, either. <strong>“</strong>There were no coffee shops in London,” she says, which today seems ludicrous. “Just greasy spoons and everyone drank tea. I wanted a European-style cafe.”</p>

<p>Linking up with like-minded pioneers David Rowe and husband and wife Keith and Gené Teare, Eva found a spot on the corner of Whitfield Street and launched Cyberia there in 1994. With <em>Hackers</em>-style aesthetics and futuristic furniture, it was based around a U-shaped layout that meant visitors could see each other’s screens. “I wanted women to feel safe, because a lot of the stuff on the net was dodgy,” she explains. Many of Eva’s mates chipped in to help out––architects, interior designers, graphic artists, publishers, and ravers among them.</p>

<p>The Cyberia brand spread across the world, eventually opening around 20 cafes, including branches in Bangkok, Paris, and Rotterdam. For a fleeting moment it became like a sexier version of Richard Branson’s Virgin empire: there was Cyberia Records, Cyberia Channel (a pioneering streaming service), Cyberia Payments, the Cyberia magazine, a Cyberia show on UK TV—even a Cyberia wedding.</p>



<p>Sadly, the building is now<strong> </strong>a fancy French restaurant. But at the end of September I headed to Cyberia’s 30th birthday party, held at a Sam Smith’s pub round the corner from the old site. In an upstairs function room, the cafe’s original innovators were shooting the shit about the good times and the not-so-good coffee. The consensus seems to be that these scrappy cybernauts—now developers, consultants, and AI coders—were lightyears ahead of everyone else.</p>

<p>It had arrived at a perfect time; there was ecstasy in the air in 1994 and Eva wanted to make everything open-source.<strong> </strong>“It was all very utopian. We thought the internet would solve everyone’s problems. All we’d need to do was connect everybody and we’d have democracy forever. It didn’t quite pan out like that,” Eva says. No shit.</p>

<p>It was also something collective. “Going online was a social phenomenon, both out there in cyberspace and here in the real world. A place like the Cyberia cafe felt and worked like the internet itself. Coffee, friends, information-sharing, trippy conversations… they were all part of the same cultural experience.”</p>



<p>As were raves; free parties were hardwired into the cybernetic movement. “You’d go to a cyber cafe to design a rave flyer, work out fractals for projections, or go onto a bulletin service to find out where the next party was going to be. And it was also the place you’d leave the flyer or map point for your next party,” Douglas continues.</p>

<p>Following the 1994 The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act, which effectively outlawed the rave movement, Eva and her gang mucked in. “We went out of our way to provide support in the clubs and fields with connectivity and generators.” That included sex parties, too. “My team of girls turned up to one and everyone was wearing gimp masks, but we closed our eyes and stayed and did the job.” But the rave also continued at Cyberia. “We had something called the Cyber Breakfast on Sundays. We’d head down from the flat upstairs and people would rock up at six in the morning from the clubs around King’s Cross, smoking or taking God knows what while surfing online using some lateral thinking,” Eva remembers. Basically, an afters with desktops, with people checking their emails on E.</p>



<p>The London branch also had its very own audio-visual set-up. “We had a friend living in Goa who would DJ for hours and hours, five in the morning until five in the afternoon. We’d put sheets on the windows and put projections of visuals on it. People get excited about AI animations now but I’m like, mate, we were doing it in the 90s!”</p>

<p>Gaming also gave Cyberia a new level. “We created a space underneath Cyberia called Subcyberia. People were gaming for hours on end,” Eva says (there was also a workspace called Trancyberia on the second floor; essentially a WeWork on acid). But this was also the beginning of Cyberia’s end. By 2004, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2020">57 percent of people in the UK had internet access at home</a>. Cyberia shut down in the UK and Eva’s partners licensed it out to a company in Korea, where<em> PC bangs</em>—gaming-centric internet cafes—were, and still are, extremely popular.</p>







<p>Now, the internet cafes that still exist in the UK (<a href="https://rentechdigital.com/smartscraper/business-report-details/list-of-internet-cafes-in-united-kingdom">around 669, apparently</a>) are pretty scruffy high-street digs mainly used for printing and passport photos. There’s obviously not going to be an internet cafe reboot. And especially none like Cyberia. After all, the 90s was a different time. “Most of us were off our heads. The drugs were a lot more prevalent, mainstream and acceptable. The younger generation don’t have this crazy lifestyle we had,” Eva says.</p>



<p>Instead, we’re all at the mercy of the Silicon Valley zealots.</p>

<p>“Society’s become so straight-laced and it’s not good for people. The early internet recognised that humans are 360-degree people with dark and wonderful things. Now we’re kicked into a corner online based on the moral values of three people in Nebraska,” Eva laments. And the internet is a cesspit of AI-generated shit. “Going online used to be a bit like an acid trip,” says Douglas. “That’s why I called the book <em>Cyberia</em>. It was a journey to a place where the rules of reality were different. Better. But living online, in the always-on landscape of algorithms programming our behavior…? That’s bound to be a bad trip.”</p>

<p>Back at the Cyberia party, Eva is triggering hazy memories with a slideshow of the cafe’s most hedonistic moments. “The internet wasn’t just coding, it was a whole culture. It was a lifestyle,” she says and tankards of Taddy lager are thrust into the air by teary-eyed cyber pirates who tried to change the world.</p>



<p>Sayonara, Cyberia; for a while back there, you got a lot of odd people totally wired.</p>
