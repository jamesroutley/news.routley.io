Putin’s more than 23-year rule in Russia and followed an apparent intervention by the leader of neighboring Belarus, who stepped in to negotiate a solution to the crisis directly with the head of the Wagner private military company, Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, who was leading the revolt. </p><div><p>The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters that under an agreement brokered by Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, the leader of Belarus, Mr. Prigozhin would go to Belarus and the criminal case opened against him for organizing an armed insurrection would be dropped. </p><p>The Wagner fighters who didn’t participate in the uprising would be given the option of signing Russian Defense Ministry contracts, Mr. Peskov said, and the rest would avoid prosecution, considering their “heroic deeds on the front.”<span>  </span></p><p>“There was a higher goal — to avoid bloodshed, to avoid an internal confrontation, to avoid clashes with unpredictable consequences,” Mr. Peskov said. “It was in the name of these goals that Lukashenko’s mediation efforts were realized, and President Putin made the corresponding decisions.”</p><p>In an audio statement earlier in the evening, Mr. Prigozhin announced that his troops marching toward Moscow would turn around. His forces, which had seized the Southern Military District headquarters in Rostov-on-Don, also appeared to be leaving in footage shared on social media.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/24/world/russia-ukraine-news/putin-strikes-a-tough-tone-in-his-first-address-since-the-uprising-started?smid=url-share" title="">a brief address</a> on Saturday morning, Mr. Putin had called the mutiny an act of treason by people who were delivering “a stab in the back of our country and our people.”</p><p>Mr. Prigozhin, after lashing out on Friday at the Russian military over its handling of the war in Ukraine, took control of Rostov in the early morning and began moving his armed military convoys toward the Russian capital. Mr. Putin, in turn, scrambled security forces in southwestern Russia and Moscow.</p><p>The situation shifted quickly late Saturday when Mr. Lukashenko’s office, in a statement, said that Mr. Prigozhin had agreed to the Belarusian leader’s proposal “to stop the movement of armed persons of the Wagner company.” In an audio statement posted to Telegram shortly afterward, Mr. Prigozhin said he was “turning around” to avoid Russian bloodshed and “leaving in the opposite direction to field camps in accordance with the plan.”</p><p>Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said the leader of Belarus, who had long been personally acquainted with Mr. Prigozhin, proposed serving as a mediator — and Mr. Putin agreed. </p><p>“We are grateful to the president for his efforts,” Mr. Peskov said.</p><p>Here is the latest:</p><ul><li><p>The mercurial Wagner leader’s long-running criticism of Moscow’s military leadership erupted into open confrontation on Friday when he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/world/europe/russia-prigozhin-putin-war-ukraine.html" title="">accused the Russian Army of attacking his forces</a> and pledged to retaliate. Russian authorities said they were charging Mr. Prigozhin with “organizing an armed rebellion” against the Russian president. In an audio message on Saturday, Mr. Prigozhin (pronounced pree-GOH-shin) rejected accusations of treason and said that his forces were “patriots of our motherland.”</p></li><li><p>Kremlin apparatchiks, regional governors, lawmakers and other officials <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/24/world/russia-ukraine-news/russian-officials-proclaim-loyalty-to-putin-and-predict-victory-for-him?smid=url-share" title="">declared their fealty to Mr. Putin</a>, with virtually all predicting that he would prevail. No central figures publicly took Mr. Prigozhin’s side.</p></li><li><p>U.S. officials said they were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/24/world/russia-ukraine-news/the-us-points-to-heightened-uncertainty-amid-russias-crisis-officials-say?smid=url-share" title="">watching the situation closely</a> but did not want to say anything publicly that could give Mr. Putin reason to blame the West for the turmoil.</p></li><li><p>Asked whether the uprising would result in changes to the Russian military leadership, as Mr. Prigozhin had demanded, Mr. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said those decisions were exclusively the domain of Russia’s commander-in-chief, so “such matters could scarcely be discussed” in such talks. Mr. Peskov also said Russia’s military operations in Ukraine would continue unchanged.</p></li><li><p>In eastern Ukraine, residents saw the rebellion as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/24/world/russia-ukraine-news/as-fighter-jets-roar-near-the-front-line-some-ukrainians-welcome-the-crisis-in-russia?smid=url-share" title="">a distraction for Russia that could help Kyiv’s forces</a>.

The columns of Wagner fighters streamed out of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don on Saturday night as some residents chanted the group’s name.</p><p>Among those departing was the mercenary group’s founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin. He left the city’s military headquarters, according <a href="https://t.me/rsotmdivision/8288" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to a photo posted</a> by an affiliated military blogger. The Kremlin said he would go to neighboring Belarus.</p><div><p>In videos posted by local and state media, some residents thanked the Wagner fighters and others hugged them as they prepared to leave for what Mr. Prigozhin described as unnamed training camps. Some <a href="https://t.me/news161ru/33822" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fired shots in the air</a> as they drove out.</p><p>The small crowds that gathered to see Wagner off showed that the group has maintained at least some popular support in Rostov, a city where their fighters have been a regular presence since Russia seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backed Russian-speaking separatists in the Donbas region in Ukraine’s east.</p><p>The government made a public offer of amnesty to the Wagner rebels.</p><p>Less than 24 hours earlier, Wagner’s seemingly bloodless takeover of Rostov, one of Russia’s largest military hubs, appeared to show the group’s transformation from a minor paramilitary force into a major political power capable of holding a metropolis of more than a million people.</p><p>The group’s brief tenure in the city produced surreal footage of a short-lived mutiny that dumbfounded the most experienced Kremlinoligsts. A Wagner tank lodged itself into Rostov’s circus grounds, and residents were filmed calmly going about their business while masked armed men barricaded the city’s streets. And a rival paramilitary force of Chechen fighters that was sent to the city to dislodge Wagner never arrived.</p><p>Through the occupation, the local security forces appeared to offer no organized resistance to Wagner, and there have been no confirmed deaths in a city filled with military personnel. Local media reported that Wagner units had surrounded the local military and security agency offices, barricading officers inside but allowing them to order takeout.</p><p>Mr. Prigozhin said that his force’s occupation of Rostov’s military headquarters did not disrupt the officers’ daily wartime task: coordinating the defenses of occupied Ukrainian territories amid Kyiv’s ongoing counteroffensive. That claim was impossible to verify, but on Saturday the dramatic events in Russia were not matched by significant developments on Ukraine’s battlefields.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="60" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzdiNjU4MzhjLWQ4NDQtNTI2Yy1iZDZkLTUxODFlN2MxMWRlZg=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/24/world/russia-wagner-prigozhin-ukraine-news#the-wagner-uprising-unraveled-less-than-24-hours-after-it-began" data-source-id="100000008969054"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/valerie-hopkins"><img alt="Valerie Hopkins" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/06/23/reader-center/author-valerie-hopkins/author-valerie-hopkins-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></a></p><div><p><span><time aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-06-24T21:51:22.000Z"><p><span data-time="abs">June 24, 2023, 5:51 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2023, 5:51 p.m. ET</span></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">President Alexandr G.

Prigozhin with inciting an armed uprising for launching a march on Moscow, then forgave the Russian mercenary leader and his soldiers after they suddenly turned around and began withdrawing from southern Russia as part of a deal negotiated with Belarus.</p><p>As part of the roller coaster developments, Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told journalists on Saturday night that the criminal case against Mr. Prigozhin, the leader of the Wagner mercenary group, would be dropped. Under the terms of the deal, Mr. Prigozhin will go to Belarus, Mr. Peskov said, while the fighters who rebelled with him would not be prosecuted, given their “service at the front.” Wagner fighters who did not participate in the mutiny would have the opportunity to sign contracts with the Russian Ministry of Defense and continue their service, he said, saying their “heroic deeds at the front” would “always be respected.”</p><div><p>“There was a higher goal: to avoid bloodshed, to avoid internal confrontation, to avoid clashes with unpredictable results,” Mr. Peskov said in a call with journalists after Mr. Prigozhin had confirmed the announcement of a deal by the Belarusian president, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, a staunch Putin ally. </p><p>“It was in the name of these goals that Lukashenko’s mediation efforts were implemented,” Mr. Peskov said. “President Putin made a corresponding decision.”</p><p>Mr. Peskov said that Mr. Lukashenko “has been acquainted with Mr. Prigozhin for a long time, at least 20 years,” and that Mr. Lukashenko had personally offered to broker a deal. </p><p>Mr. Peskov said the armed rebellion would not impact Moscow’s capacity to wage war in Ukraine, and that its military operations would continue unchanged. He refused to address speculation that there could be shake-ups in the Defense Ministry. </p><p>On Friday night, Mr. Prigozhin announced a “march for justice” to Moscow after alleging that his private military contractors had been attacked from behind by Russian soldiers. The attack has not been verified, and prosecutors in Moscow accused him of mounting an armed coup.</p><p>As the news of the deal was announced, analysts expressed surprise and shock that tensions had seemingly eased, despite Mr. Prigozhin’s seizure of a strategically important command center for Russia’s southern military district in Rostov-on-Don, downed three Russian military aircraft and killed 12 of the personnel manning them. Soldiers had been deployed across southern Russia to strengthen regional defenses and roads south of Moscow. </p><p>“It turns out that Prigozhin bet everything he had on his ‘march of justice,’ spent it at the cost of the lives of a dozen Russian pilots and valuable aircraft, and in the end was left with nothing — exactly what we were afraid of,” wrote a military blogger known as Military Informer.</p><p>Still others were asking about the whereabouts of Defense Minister Sergei K. Shoigu, the primary target of Mr. Prigozhin’s ire in months of tirades against Russia’s political and military elites. </p><p>“OK, everything is clear with Putin and Prigozhin,” wrote Russian businessman and opposition leader Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky on his Telegram channel. “And where is our ‘inflexible’ Shoigu?”</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="58" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYTI0Y2U3NjEtZWRhYi01OGI2LTlhZTktNGY5Y2QxZGE1ZGYy"><div id="a24ce761-edab-58b6-9ae9-4f9cd1da5df2" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/24/world/russia-wagner-prigozhin-ukraine-news#a24ce761-edab-58b6-9ae9-4f9cd1da5df2"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Peter Baker" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/13/multimedia/peter-baker/peter-baker-thumbLarge-v2.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-06-24T21:33:28.000Z"><p><span data-time="abs">June 24, 2023, 5:33 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2023, 5:33 p.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Peter Baker</span></p></div></div></div><p>One of the most nerve-wracking aspects of a crisis like the one in Russia the disposition of nuclear weapons.

Prigozhin, the mercenary leader who nearly precipitated a civil war in Russia on Saturday, was never afraid of a dirty task, many say.</p><p>Emerging from jail as the Soviet Union was collapsing, he began his post-criminal career selling hot dogs on street corners in St. Petersburg, Russia. There, he befriended Vladimir V. Putin, then a minor official in the city government, developed a catering business and earned billions on government contracts when his friend Vladimir became prime minister and then president of Russia.</p><div><p>Mr. Prigozhin quickly earned the trust of his benefactor, who assigned him a number of important tasks that were best handled at arm’s length from the government. The first and most notorious of those was overseeing the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html?searchResultPosition=9" title="">Internet Research Agency,</a> a troll farm founded in 2013 to flood the United States and Europe with disinformation that discredited liberal elites and promoted hard-right ideologies.</p><p>From there, he raised mercenaries to fight in Syria and Libya, and, most fatefully, founded the private military group Wagner, which emerged during Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. It quickly earned a reputation for ruthless violence in pursuit of lucrative diamond and gold concessions, while building political influence for the Kremlin in countries like the Central African Republic, Libya, Mali and Sudan.</p><p>Throughout those years, Mr. Prigozhin kept an extremely low profile, never even admitting to the existence of Wagner, let alone his having a role in it.</p><p>That began to change during the war in Ukraine, as the Russian military suffered setback after setback and Mr. Prigozhin became disgusted with the greed, corruption and ineptitude he claimed to see in the upper echelons of the military.</p><p>“These are Wagner guys who died today; the blood is still fresh,” Mr. Prigozhin said, addressing Russia’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, and the commander of the armed forces, Valery V. Gersasimov. “They came here as volunteers and they die so you can get fat in your mahogany offices.”</p><p>As his critiques of Russia’s top military leaders grew more frequent and intemperate, he began to emerge as a public figure, insisting that his forces could do the job far better than the Russian regulars.</p><p>He recruited thousands of convicts from Russian prisons and threw them into the bloody fight over the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, often with the ruthlessness and indifference to human life that he attributed to Russian commanders. Along the way he feuded with General Shoigu and General Gerasimov, accusing them of depriving his forces of ammunition to try to destroy Wagner, an action he said “can be equated to treason.”</p><p>For Mr. Prigozhin, a breaking point was reached on Friday night, when, he says, Russian forces attacked his men as they slept in their camps (something that Russia denies and that has not been independently confirmed). On Saturday, he led a force he claimed to number 25,000 out of Ukraine and into Russia, where he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/24/world/russia-wagner-prigozhin-ukraine-news" title="">seized the city of Rostov-on-Don</a>, a military hub, with virtually no resistance.</p><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Wagner forces took control of Rostov-on-Don, a strategically important military hub in southern Russia, on Saturday without encountering any resistance.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p>Always a complex figure, he was prone to vituperative outbursts and threats that were quickly forgotten or contradicted, as happened on Saturday. After first claiming he would march his forces all the way to Moscow, he reversed course later in the day. He had agreed to a proposal by the Belarusian leader, Aleksandr G. Lukashenko, “to stop the movement of armed persons of the Wagner company” and move to Belarus. In return, the Russian government would drop the charges of treason against him and grant amnesty to his soldiers.</p><p>It remains unclear if he can return to Russia, but he has capitalized on his feud with the generals to fashion himself as a populist political figure, fighting for humble servicemen and others suffering at the hands of “unqualified scoundrels and intrigants.”</p><p>He has contrasted that with what he sees as the decadence of Russian elites and the injustice in society.</p><p>“The children of the elite smear themselves with creams, showing it on the internet; ordinary people’s children come in zinc, torn to pieces,” he said, referring to the coffins of dead soldiers, and adding that those killed in action had “tens of thousands” of relatives. “Society always demands justice,” he said, “and if there is no justice, then revolutionary sentiments arise.”</p><p>Where Mr. Prigozhin goes from here is hard to pin down, as is the fate of Wagner.</p><p>If he remains in control of the company, and that is by no means assured, he will still command considerable military assets, but they will be devalued if they cannot rely on the support of the Russian military.</p><p>Apart from his standing force, Mr. Prigozhin claimed this month that 32,000 former convicts who had served with Wagner in Ukraine had returned to their homes in Russia. Many of these veterans have expressed strong loyalty to Mr. Prigozhin and have considered returning to its ranks, according to interviews with survivors and their relatives, providing an additional pool of potential recruits to the rebel cause.</p><p>Yet most experts believe Wagner’s real strength is far below what Mr. Prigozhin claims, and that he is hoping more Russian soldiers and security agents disgusted by the corruption and mistreatment they see will respond to his populist critique of the leadership and join his ranks.</p><p>The U.S. government estimated in December that Wagner had 10,000 professional soldiers. That number most likely fell in recent months as Wagner was forced to throw its most experienced units into battle to finalize the capture of Bakhmut, according to Ukrainian and Western intelligence officials.</p><p>Mr. Prigozhin himself said this year that after the capture of Bakhmut, his force would “downsize” as it prepared for new missions.</p><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">With Mr. Prigozhin ostensibly on the way to Belarus, the fate of Wagner and its fighters is hard to pin down.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Agence France-Presse — Getty Images</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p>Notably, Mr. Prigozhin had managed to run a force numbering tens of thousands of fighters largely on cash. Veterans and their relatives had received salaries, as well as death and injury compensations, through an elaborate network of nameless intermediaries spread across the nation.</p><p>The mutiny is likely to have erased that logistical support.

Prigozhin, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/world/europe/yevgeny-prigozhin-russia-wagner-coup.html" title="">the Wagner mercenary leader</a> who conducted a brief rebellion against the Russian military, had been a loyal supporter of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</p><p>In recent months, he continued to steer clear of directly criticizing Mr. Putin, even as he increasingly used social media to lambaste Russia’s military, accusing its leaders of treason and blaming them for failing to provide his forces with enough resources. </p><div><p>But over the last two days, he assailed the rationale for Mr. Putin’s so-called special military operation in Ukraine, sent his forces to seize the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, a military hub, and began to move Wagner convoys toward Moscow. Mr. Putin mobilized Russian troops to quell what he called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/world/europe/russia-prigozhin-putin-war-ukraine.html" title="">an armed rebellion</a>, and the Belarusian president, a Putin ally, negotiated a halt to the Wagner advance.</p><p>Here’s a look at Mr. Prigozhin’s history and some of the claims he has made:</p><p><strong>December 2016</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/world/europe/us-blacklists-15-russian-entities-linked-to-ukraine-and-crimea.html" title="">United States imposed sanctions</a> against 15 Russian entities, including Mr. Prigozhin, for their dealings in Crimea, which Russia illegally annexed in 2014, and in Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatists seized territory the same year. The Treasury Department targeted businesspeople who were associates of Mr. Putin or were involved in activities that aided in Russia’s destabilization of Ukraine.</p><p><strong>February 2018</strong></p><p>Mr. Prigozhin was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html" title="">one of 13 Russians</a> <a href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">indicted</a> by a federal grand jury in the United States for interfering in the 2016 presidential election through the Internet Research Agency, a troll factory that spread falsehoods and waged information warfare in support of the campaign of Donald J. Trump.</p><p><strong>September 2022</strong></p><p>Mr. Prigozhin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/26/world/europe/russia-wagner-group-prigozhin.html" title="">publicly acknowledged</a> for the first time that he was the founder of the Wagner mercenary organization, whose fighters were deployed alongside Russian troops in Ukraine. Previously, Wagner fighters had operated in support of the Kremlin’s military campaigns in Africa and the Middle East, occasionally battling against U.S. forces.</p><p><strong>October 2022</strong></p><p>Mr. Prigozhin was one of two powerful supporters of Mr. Putin to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/01/world/europe/lyman-russia-retreat-putin.html" title="">publicly turn on Russia’s military leadership</a> after it ordered a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/10/01/world/russia-ukraine-war-news/ukraine-moves-to-encircle-lyman-a-strategic-eastern-rail-hub?smid=url-share" title="">retreat from Lyman, a key city in eastern Ukraine</a>, emphasizing that the retreat was a major embarrassment for the Kremlin.</p><p><strong>November 2022</strong></p><p>Just a day before the U.S. midterms, Mr. Prigozhin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/us/politics/yevgeny-prigozhin-putin-ally-elections.html" title="">sardonically boasted that Russia was interfering in the election</a>.</p><p>“Gentlemen, we have interfered, we do interfere and we will interfere,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html" title="">Mr. Prigozhin</a> said in a statement posted by his catering company. “We will do it carefully, precisely, surgically as we are capable of doing it. During our targeted operations, we will remove both kidneys and liver at once.”</p><p>At the time, Wagner troops were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/06/world/europe/russia-bakhmut-wagner-group.html" title="">advancing</a> on the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, which had been under Russian attack for months.</p><p><strong>February 2023</strong></p><p>Mr. Prigozhin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/21/world/europe/wagner-russia-military-prigozhin.html" title="">accused two Russian military leaders of treason</a> in a series of hostile audio messages. He claimed that the Russian defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, and its most senior general, Valery V. Gerasimov, were withholding ammunition and supplies from his fighters to try to destroy Wagner.</p><p>Earlier in the month, Mr. Prigozhin had said that Wagner would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/09/world/europe/russia-wagner-prisoners-ukraine.html" title="">no longer recruit fighters</a> from Russian prisons, a practice that had raised criticism from human rights groups but helped fuel Moscow’s advances in eastern Ukraine.</p><p><strong>May 2023</strong></p><p>Mr. Prigozhin issued a series of inflammatory statements. He once again accused Russia’s military bureaucracy of starving Wagner forces of necessary ammunition and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/05/05/world/russia-ukraine-bakhmut-wagner-news?smid=url-share#wagner-bakhmut-russia-ukraine-prigozhin" title="">threatened to withdraw them from Bakhmut</a>. Days later, he appeared to backtrack on that threat after saying he had been promised more arms.</p><p>In late May, Wagner forces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/20/world/europe/ukraine-russia-bakhmut-war.html" title="">said they had captured Bakhmut</a>, a claim it had made previously as well. Ukrainian officials quickly denied the claim, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/22/world/europe/bakhmut-russia-ukraine-retreat.html" title="">days later acknowledged the loss of the city</a>. Russian state media <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/world/europe/wagner-group-prigozhin-russia.html" title="">kept</a> Mr. Prigozhin’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/24/world/europe/wagner-group-prigozhin-russia.html" title="">name out</a> of its coverage of those events.</p><p>Earlier in the month, Mr. Prigozhin <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/15/world/europe/wagner-prigozhin-bakhmut.html" title="">dismissed a report</a> from The Washington Post saying that leaked intelligence showed he had offered to share Russian Army positions with Ukraine.</p><p><strong>June 2023</strong></p><p>Tensions between Mr. Prigozhin and Russia’s military rose higher. Mr. Prigozhin said Wagner would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/11/world/europe/wagner-russia-defense-ministry-contract.html" title="">not comply with an order</a> that would require it to sign a formal contract with Russia’s defense ministry by July.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/world/europe/russia-prigozhin-putin-war-ukraine.html" title="">The feud rapidly escalated</a> on Friday of last week, when Mr. Prigozhin released a 30-minute video in which he described his country’s invasion of Ukraine as a “racket” perpetrated by a corrupt elite chasing money and glory without concern for Russian lives. He also challenged the Kremlin’s claim that Kyiv had been on the verge of attacking Russian-backed separatist territory in Ukraine’s east when Russia invaded.</p><p>“The war wasn’t needed to return Russian citizens to our bosom, nor to demilitarize or denazify Ukraine,” Mr. Prigozhin said, referring to Mr. Putin’s initial justifications for the war. “The war was needed so that a bunch of animals could simply exult in glory.”</p><p>Mr. Prigozhin also accused Mr. Shoigu, the Russian minister of defense, of orchestrating a deadly attack with missiles and helicopters on camps to the rear of the Russian lines in Ukraine, where his soldiers were bivouacked. </p><p>The Russian defense ministry denied the allegations, saying in a statement that the messages Mr. Prigozhin had posted about supposed strikes on Wagner camps “do not correspond to reality.” His account of the attacks remains unconfirmed. </p><p>Mr. Putin mobilized Russian troops on Saturday to defend Moscow from what he called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/world/europe/russia-prigozhin-putin-war-ukraine.html" title="">an armed rebellion</a> by Mr. Prigozhin, whose forces had claimed control of Rostov-on-Don and were seen moving north along a highway toward the Russian capital. Then, in a surprise turn of events, the Belarusian president, Alexsandr G. Lukashenko, said he had secured Mr. Prigozhin agreement to halt his forces’ advance. Mr. Prigozhin confirmed that he was turning his forces around. </p><p>The Kremlin’s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, said that Mr. Prigozhin would flee to Belarus, and that Russia’s military operations in Ukraine would continue unchanged.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="53" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMTE4MDdlMmEtMDIxMy01ZTU5LTllNjQtYzJiZWI5YWViYzEz"><div id="11807e2a-0213-5e59-9e64-c2beb9aebc13" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/24/world/russia-wagner-prigozhin-ukraine-news#11807e2a-0213-5e59-9e64-c2beb9aebc13"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Anatoly Kurmanaev" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/12/reader-center/author-anatoly-kurmanaev/author-anatoly-kurmanaev-thumbLarge-v4.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-06-24T20:06:59.000Z"><p><span data-time="abs">June 24, 2023, 4:06 p.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2023, 4:06 p.m. ET</span></span></p><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Anatoly Kurmanaev</span></p></div></div></div><p>Wagner armored vehicles began leaving the military hub of Rostov-on-Don, in southwestern Russia, on Saturday night, as a group of local supporters chanted the mercenary group’s name, according to videos posted on social media.

It serves as a kind of Praetorian guard, bearing the main responsibility for protecting the president.</p><p>After that, the main Federal Security Service, the F.S.B., has a large military counterintelligence department. Although it tries to ferret out foreign spies in the armed forces, its main task is watching the military, Mr. Galeotti said.</p><p>In terms of military units, there are two central ones assigned the task of guarding Moscow. They are the 4th Guard “Kantemirovskaya” Tank Division, nicknamed after one of their most famous battles, and the 2nd Guards Motor Division. Although both divisions have had units rotate through Ukraine, there is at least one regiment each, or 3,000 men apiece, left in Moscow at all times, Mr. Galeotti said.</p><p>Beyond that, there are various units of the Spetsnaz special forces; the National Guard and specialized riot police. And the Interior Ministry has a large police force. While not exactly military units, their members are all armed and could be called upon to shoot at the Wagner mercenaries.</p><p>On the other side, the Wagner group is estimated to have some 25,000 men, although accounts vary as to how many are deployed along the Russia-Ukraine front and how many are in far-flung assignments in the Middle East and Africa.</p><p>Whatever the number, Mr. Galeotti noted, it is likely insufficient to take on all the government forces mustered in Moscow, especially because Wagner fighters are limited in terms of their own air power, transportation and other logistics issues.</p><p>The scattered videos of Russian troops advancing from the southwestern city of Rostov-on-Don, where the rebellion started, to Moscow show mostly men in trucks or on armored personnel carriers, and very little in the way of artillery or tanks, Mr. Galeotti noted.

Putin trumpeted the so-called special military operation as a replay of Russia’s proudest hour — its victory against Nazi Germany in World War II.</p><p>On Saturday, however, Mr. Putin was struggling to stop history from repeating itself — not the glories of 1945 but the fratricidal horror of Russia’s civil war from 1917 to 1923.</p><div><p>“We will not let this happen again,” Mr. Putin told his country in a somber television address, recalling modern Russia’s darkest period as he tried to rally support against an armed rebellion by the Kremlin-nurtured mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin.</p><p>Instead of garlanding the current crisis with references to World War II — which Russia calls the Great Patriotic War, a favorite Putin topic — the Russian leader spoke instead of 1917. “Intrigues, quarrels, politicking behind the back of the army and the people turned into the greatest upheaval, the destruction of the army and the collapse of the state, the loss of vast territories,” he said. “In the end was the tragedy of the civil war.”</p><p>In September 1917, a charismatic right-wing officer named Lavr Kornilov attempted a coup against an unpopular moderate, socialist-led provisional government by marching his forces on St. Petersburg, which was then the Russian capital and known as Petrograd. Like Mr. Prigozhin today, Kornilov styled himself as the nation’s savior and hoped that his relatively modest forces would grow as they neared the capital. </p><p>In the end, however, his forces disintegrated before reaching the city. Kornilov’s coup attempt is seen today as merely hastening the takeover by Lenin’s ruthless Bolsheviks, by weakening their moderate opponents.</p><p>The outcome of the struggle with Mr. Prigozhin is yet to be decided. But by drawing a parallel with the turmoil of 1917, Mr. Putin has already acknowledged the unraveling of what was supposed to be his greatest achievement — rescuing Russia from the chaos that followed the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.</p><p>Throughout the 1990s, when Russia’s president was Boris N. Yeltsin, he and his political enemies regularly accused each other of tipping the country toward civil war. That came perilously close to happening in October 1993, when Mr. Yeltsin sent tanks into the center of Moscow to shell the Parliament building that had been seized by armed rebels.</p><p>Mr. Putin vowed to put an end to all that disarray after he took over from Mr. Yeltsin at the end of 1999. Rolling back the often unruly freedoms of the 1990s, he presented his own increasingly autocratic rule as a balm to heal civil discord and keep Russians from again fighting each other.</p><p>White Russians, the fiercely anti-communist aristocrats and generals who battled the Bolshevik Reds for more than five years starting in 1917 and then mostly fled into exile, were rehabilitated in official histories as patriots. The bones of some of them were returned to Russia for reburial as a sign of national healing, and the revival of Russia as an imperial power.</p><p>Among those reinterred at the Donskoy Monastery in Moscow was Gen. Anton Denikin, a White Russian leader who was reviled as a traitor during the Soviet era but was embraced by Mr. Putin as a “true Russian patriot.” He had proved himself, Mr. Putin said, by refusing to seek help against the Bolsheviks from Ukrainians who had tried to take advantage of Russia’s civil war to<span>  </span>form an independent state separate from Russia. In the end, Ukraine became independent in 1991, as the Soviet Union dissolved.<span>  </span></p><p>History has now come full circle. As Mr. Prigozhin sent thousands of armed followers toward Moscow on what he called a “march for justice,” Mr. Putin condemned the action as “treason” that had to be crushed.</p><p>“Putin always wanted to repeat the Great Patriotic War,” said Volodymyr Viatrovych, a Ukrainian historian and lawmaker, “but he instead repeated the civil war.”</p><p>Anatoly Kurmanaev<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="21" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvMWM3YmI5MzctNzliMC01ZGM4LWFjYzctNTIzYjRmZjk2MmM0"><div id="1c7bb937-79b0-5dc8-acc7-523b4ff962c4" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/24/world/russia-wagner-prigozhin-ukraine-news#1c7bb937-79b0-5dc8-acc7-523b4ff962c4"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-06-24T15:15:17.000Z"><p><span data-time="abs">June 24, 2023, 11:15 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2023, 11:15 a.m. ET</span></span></p><div><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Gülsin Harman</span></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">reporting from Istanbul</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s office confirmed that he had a phone call with President Vladimir V.

Prigozhin, the pugnacious head of the Wagner mercenary group, seized control of a key military headquarters in the southwestern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and began dispatching convoys of troops and armored vehicles toward the capital. President Vladimir V. Putin continued to work in the Kremlin, his spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told reporters.</p><p>Even before the uprising, officials had made every effort to project an air of normalcy in Moscow while Russia waged a brutal war across the border in Ukraine. Much of that effort continued on Saturday. Movie theaters and museums were open in the capital, and there was no sign of lines at the supermarkets to stock up on goods.</p><p>Still, there were some indications of the crisis. Red Square, just outside the formidable medieval walls of the Kremlin, was closed to the public. A large graduation ceremony scheduled for the theater inside the Kremlin was canceled, as were all large public gatherings in Moscow and other major cities.</p><p>In Moscow, and in two other regions between the capital and Rostov-on-Don, the authorities announced a “counterterrorist operation regime,” expanding the powers of the local law enforcement.</p><p>Along that corridor, highways were blocked and public transportation also faced disruptions in some places. The price of airline tickets from Moscow to nearby capitals that Russians can enter without a visa skyrocketed.</p><p>In Rostov, where there was some anticipation that Russian government forces might besiege the city to bottle up Mr. Prigozhin’s forces, some residents lined up to purchase gasoline and food, <a href="https://161.ru/text/incidents/2023/06/24/72430112/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">according to 161.ru</a>, a local online news outlet. Some supermarkets took measures like limiting the amount of essential goods — including salt, sugar and flour — that customers could purchase.</p><p>People snapped pictures of Wagner’s tanks, or argued with its fighters. “What is happening,” <a href="https://vk.com/podslushanornd?w=wall-59925632_1360483_r1360498" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wondered</a> Irina Alenina, a resident of Rostov-on-Don, in a local news group on Vkontakte, a social messaging app. “A civil war is starting, or something like that,” <a href="https://vk.com/podslushanornd?w=wall-59925632_1360483_r1360547" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">responded</a> Aleksandr Salazov.</p><p>State-run television and newspapers were reporting the events in real time, forgoing their previous tradition of putting the ballet “Swan Lake” on an endless loop until the crisis of the moment had passed.</p><p>Some Russians remembered similar crises from the past, like the periodic eruptions that marked the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s.</p><p>“I remember I was 5 and was going to a kindergarten and tanks were shooting at the White House on TV,” wrote Dmitri Dakhin on Vkontakte, referring to the shelling of what was Russia’s parliament building in Moscow at the time. “Now I am 35 and again something bad happens.”</p><p>Some of the calm could be attributed to support for Mr. Putin. Olga Rudeva, 64, said that trust in the Russian leader had made the situation now very different from the turmoil of the coup attempt against Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991. </p><p>A tour guide in Voronezh — one of the cities reached by the Wagner forces en route to Moscow on Saturday before Mr. Prigozhin said he had ordered them to turn around — Ms. Rudeva said in a telephone interview that, back then, people were afraid of the unknown. In contrast, she said, she was about to go out for a walk and her grandchildren had gone to the park to swim.

Putin of Russia always seemed to thrive on chaos. Then it threatened to consume him.</p><p>For the last few months, as the mercenary chieftain Yevgeny V. Prigozhin escalated his feud with the Russian military, Mr. Putin did not publicly reveal any discomfort with his diatribes. The silence fostered the kind of political ambiguity that has long been a trademark of Mr. Putin’s rule: tolerating, even encouraging, conflict among the elite because it kept potential rivals in check, while underscoring that ultimate authority always rested with the president himself.</p><div><p>The Russian leader’s key litmus test was loyalty — a fact that Mr. Prigozhin showed he understood, even amid his recent criticism of the military leadership: “I listen to Putin,” he said in May. And yet on Saturday, after more than 20 years profiting from his personal ties to Mr. Putin, Mr. Prigozhin cast the last shreds of that loyalty aside and plunged Russia into its biggest political crisis in three decades, as his forces seized control of key military facilities in the southwestern city of Rostov-on-Don and threatened to enter Moscow.</p><p>The specter of a pitched battle for Moscow appeared averted — at least for the moment — on Saturday night, after Mr. Prigozhin declared that he was turning around his troops who had been marching toward the Russian capital.</p><p>But at no point since being named acting president on Dec. 31, 1999, had Mr. Putin faced such a dramatic challenge. And it came from a man who — like much of Russia’s elite — owes his power and status to the informal, personalist style of the Russian president.</p><p>“Putin underestimated” the threat posed by Mr. Prigozhin, said Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center. “He thought he was totally dependent and loyal.”</p><p>Mr. Putin’s patience with Mr. Prigozhin’s outbursts this year may have served his political purposes, but it prompted officials stunned by Mr. Prigozhin’s verbal attacks on Russia’s top brass to conclude that he enjoyed the president’s tacit support, analysts said. It also further emboldened Mr. Prigozhin, who even as he launched his armed rebellion insisted that “this is not a coup” and that “presidential authority” would remain in place.</p><p>The confusion over Mr. Putin’s personal views only came to an end Saturday morning, when the president delivered a five-minute address to the nation describing Mr. Prigozhin — without naming him — as a traitor and vowing to quell the uprising the paramilitary leader had started. But the damage had already been done.</p><p>Throughout Saturday’s drama, there were no immediate signs that Mr. Putin’s hold on power was about to crumble, with no one in the Russian elite publicly siding with Mr. Prigozhin. Other powerful men at the nodes of Mr. Putin’s informal power structure — like Ramzan Kadyrov, the strongman leader of the southern Russian region of Chechnya, who controls his own paramilitary force — voiced their support for the president on Saturday.</p><p>To be sure, amid the fast-moving developments, there was no way to know whether Mr. Prigozhin may have garnered some support behind the scenes. Nor was it clear what would come of the deal he struck with President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus, whose government announced late Saturday that it had brokered an agreement to defuse the crisis.</p><p>The events were a striking consequence of the informal power structure that Mr. Putin built up in his 23 years at Russia’s helm. For more than two decades, the system helped Mr. Putin secure his unrivaled authority, ensuring that he personally held the keys to wealth and influence in modern Russia.</p><p>People who know Mr. Putin say that the president has always been comfortable with that personalized system, because it allowed him to entrust key tasks to a trusted inner circle while preventing the rise of rival cliques that could undermine him. And it ensured that the institutions of the state — from the courts to Parliament to the news media to the multiple security services — remained mere instruments in internecine power plays mediated by Mr. Putin, rather than sources of influence in their own right.</p><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Fighters of from the Wagner private mercenary group deployed on a street in Rostov-on-Don, Russia, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Reuters</span></span></span></figcaption></figure><p>Shortly after taking power, Mr. Putin used brute force to crush the “oligarch” business tycoons who held immense sway over President Boris N.

He then allowed competition among rival groups to fester, even fostering security agencies with overlapping responsibilities; for instance, an Investigative Committee, a Prosecutor General and a Federal Security Service are all involved in investigating crimes.</p><p>In the war-torn Chechnya region, Mr. Kadyrov built up a private fief while professing loyalty to no official but Mr. Putin himself.</p><p>One Russian business tycoon, reflecting on Mr. Prigozhin’s rise while speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Putin’s approach to his rule was always “divide and conquer.” As another put it, referring to Russia’s rival law enforcement authorities: “You never know who will arrest you.”</p><p>Mr. Putin’s strategy extended beyond Russia to foreign policy; he preferred to keep the world guessing about his intentions, as when his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 stunned friend and foe alike.</p><p>But for those who did navigate that system, the rewards were stupendous. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/world/europe/vladimir-putin-russia-crimea-bridge.html" title="">judo sparring partner</a> from Mr. Putin’s youth became a construction billionaire and built Mr. Putin’s landmark bridge to Crimea. Fellow K.G.B. veterans now oversee Russia’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-q-a-with-sergei-chemezov-1457657218" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">military industrial complex</a> and its <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dc7d48f8-1c13-11e8-aaca-4574d7dabfb6" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">oil sector</a>. A friend from 1990s St. Petersburg <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-billionaire-selling-putins-war-ukraine-11669994410" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">is entrusted with</a> control of Russia’s most important private media assets and of the bank said to be at the nexus of Mr. Putin’s own financial dealings.</p><p>And then there was Mr. Prigozhin, who has <a href="https://gorod-812.ru/evgeniy-prigozhin-ya-poshel-k-beglovu-k-medvedevu-tot-k-putinu/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that he met Mr. Putin in 2000 as a St. Petersburg restaurateur. He parlayed those personal ties into lucrative government contracts and styled himself as a ruthless, multipurpose problem solver for the Kremlin.</p><p>In 2016, as the Kremlin sought to swing the American presidential election to Donald J. Trump, Mr. Prigozhin jumped into the fray with an internet “troll factory,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html" title="">waging</a> “information warfare against the United States.” As Russia sought to expand its reach in Syria and Africa, Mr. Prigozhin deployed his growing Wagner mercenary force to those regions — allowing the Kremlin to project power while minimizing Russian military boots on the ground.</p><p>In Ukraine, as Mr. Prigozhin tells it, Wagner troops were only called in after Mr. Putin’s initial invasion plan failed. For much of the war’s first year, Mr. Prigozhin appeared above the law, as he toured Russian prisons to recruit thousands of convicts to bolster his force.</p><p>By early this year, the Kremlin appeared to be taking some steps to limit Mr. Prigozhin’s rise. Television commentators were directed to avoid mention of him on air, and he lost his ability to recruit convicts.</p><p>But Mr. Putin seemed to vacillate on his own support for Mr. Prigozhin. In May, he congratulated Wagner mercenaries for their role in the capture of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, in a statement <a href="http://www.en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/71172" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">posted</a> on the Kremlin’s website. Weeks later, he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-backs-push-mercenary-groups-sign-contracts-despite-wagners-refusal-2023-06-13/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">backed</a> the Defense Ministry’s push for mercenaries to sign service contracts with the Russian military by July 1, a demand that infuriated Mr. Prigozhin.</p><p>Many believed that the president saw good reason not to put a final stop to Mr. Prigozhin’s social media attacks on the Defense Ministry, which he characterized as inept, corrupt and indifferent to soldiers’ lives. Some analysts say Mr. Putin saw him as a useful figure — a check against the risk that a military leader could become overly popular.</p><p>Mr. Putin “needs someone quite weak and compromised” to represent the army politically, because in Russia, “even the most disastrous wars produce very popular generals,” said Andrei Soldatov, an expert on Russian intelligence and a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. “His scheme was to keep Prigozhin talking, but he miscalculated.”</p><p>As a result, as Mr. Putin scrambled to put down a rebellion that he warned on Saturday could lead to “anarchy and fratricide,” Mr. Prigozhin loomed as the Russian president’s own creation.</p><p>Mr. Prigozhin “had no real independent power base except the favor of the president,” Mark Galeotti, an expert on the Russian military and security services, said. “However this goes, it undermines Putin’s credibility and legitimacy.”</p><p>Neil MacFarquhar<!-- --> and <!-- -->Valerie Hopkins<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="7" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-UmVwb3J0ZXJVcGRhdGU6bnl0Oi8vcmVwb3J0ZXJ1cGRhdGUvYzYzNzczNDctYWRkMi01ZWNjLWJjOWQtZjQ2YzNhOGY0MzE5"><div id="c6377347-add2-5ecc-bc9d-f46c3a8f4319" data-testid="reporter-update" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/24/world/russia-wagner-prigozhin-ukraine-news#c6377347-add2-5ecc-bc9d-f46c3a8f4319"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="Cassandra Vinograd" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/05/03/reader-center/author-cassandra-vinograd/author-cassandra-vinograd-thumbLarge.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-06-24T13:28:04.000Z"><p><span data-time="abs">June 24, 2023, 9:28 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2023, 9:28 a.m. ET</span></span></p><div><p><span> </span><span itemprop="name">Cassandra Vinograd</span></p><p><span data-testid="lb-byline-tagline">Reporting from Kyiv</span></p></div></div></div></div><p>Secretary of State Antony J.

Putin.</p><p>Mostly posted on social media, the pledges of loyalty were uniform in declaring that in a time of crisis for the Russian state, everyone should rally behind the president and commander in chief.</p><div><p>Virtually all of them predicted victory over the insurgency.</p><p>Dmitri A. Medvedev, the former Russian president who has transformed himself into a hard-liner in the course of the war in Ukraine, said that the most important means to defeat “the external and internal enemy” was to “rally around the president, the supreme commander of the country’s armed forces.”</p><p>Roman Starovoit, the governor of the Kursk region, an area bordering Ukraine that has experienced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/06/world/europe/ukraine-drone-strikes-russian-bases.html" title="">sporadic attacks</a> during the fighting, said the war was the key task at hand. “The main enemy outside our borders is shelling peaceful settlements in our region,” Mr. Starovoit said. “This is what needs to be fought.”</p><p>In a separate post, Mr. Starovoit noted that he would not remove any of his previous posts praising the gains that the Wagner mercenary group had helped achieve in Ukraine.</p><p>Ramzan Kadyrov, the pugnacious ruler of Chechnya, promised to commit his own private militia, estimated at around 20,000 troops, to putting down the insurgency. Although some of them have fought in Ukraine, Mr. Kadyrov has a history of proclaiming a more active role than he actually carries out.</p><p>There was no sign that any central figures were taking the side of Yevgeny V. Prigozhin — the leader of the Wagner private military group whose forces on Saturday had claimed control of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and were threatening to march to Moscow — even among his professed fans, with most avoiding even mentioning him by name.</p><p>Earlier this year, Sergei Mironov, the head of the “A Just Russia” party in Parliament, proudly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/11/world/europe/russia-wagner-group-prigozhin-putin.html" title="">posed with a sledgehammer</a> that Mr. Prigozhin had sent him. The sledgehammer became a grisly symbol of the Wagner mercenary group after it used one to publicly execute a former fighter deemed a traitor.</p><p>But on Saturday, Mr. Mironov was keeping his distance.</p><p>“We will not allow the enemy to have the slightest chance,” he said in a statement. “Our country is fighting for its future.”</p><p>Mark Galeotti, an expert on the Russian military and security services, said in an interview that anyone considering supporting Mr. Prigozhin was probably waiting for a better sense of who might win.</p><p>“The only way that this can succeed now is by seizing power in the country,” he said. “The people who might be sympathetic toward Prigozhin’s critique of the war — are they necessarily up for civil war?”</p><p>Treason or joining an armed rebellion carries stiff jail sentences of up to 20 years, Mr. Galeotti noted.</p><p>“It is all about momentum, and at the moment, momentum, certainly political momentum, is with the state,” he said.</p></div></div></div><div role="article" aria-posinset="1" aria-setsize="-1" aria-live="off" aria-labelledby="post-title-QXJ0aWNsZTpueXQ6Ly9hcnRpY2xlLzVkMTM2ZTgyLTEzMWMtNTcxOC1iZTAxLWU5M2IzNTU0NTcwMQ=="><div data-testid="live-blog-post" data-url="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/24/world/russia-wagner-prigozhin-ukraine-news#as-fighter-jets-roar-near-the-front-line-some-ukrainians-welcome-the-crisis-in-russia" data-source-id="100000008968810"><div><div data-testid="live-blog-byline"><p><span><img alt="" src="https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png"/></span></p><div><p><span><time aria-hidden="true" datetime="2023-06-24T12:57:11.000Z"><p><span data-time="abs">June 24, 2023, 8:57 a.m. ET</span><span data-time="rel"></span></p></time><span aria-live="polite">June 24, 2023, 8:57 a.m. ET</span></span></p></div></div></div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">A villager was helped down the stairs after a medical appointment at a mobile clinic in the village of Romanivka, in eastern Ukraine, on Saturday.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">Mauricio Lima for The New York Times</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>ROMANIVKA, Ukraine — Just miles from the front line, news of the Wagner mercenary group’s standoff with the Russian military had reached the eastern Ukrainian village of Romanivka by Saturday morning.</p><p>As fighter jets roared and explosions echoed in the distance, some residents said they saw the mercenary group’s actions as beneficial to Ukraine and a way to possibly shorten the war or, at the least, distract Russia.</p><div><p>“Maybe they will leave us alone finally,” said Lydia, 43, who had heard the news on the Telegram messaging app and asked that her surname be withheld for safety reasons.</p><p>“Of course, it’s all sad — they are civilians like us on the other side, too,” she said. “But in general I can’t help but feel a bit joyful.”</p><p>Wagner, a paramilitary organization led by Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, has had an outsized role in Russia’s invasion. The group was primarily responsible for seizing, with help of former-inmates-turned-soldiers, the eastern Ukrainian city of Bakhmut in May. Its fighters are known to be well-trained and brutal to civilians and combatants alike.</p><p>On Saturday morning, a handful of Romanivka’s roughly 50 residents were crowded around a mobile aid clinic run by Base.UA, a nonprofit organization. One aid worker struggled to believe whether the coup attempt was real. Some older residents without smartphones had not heard the news and did not know exactly what Wagner was.</p><p>Two aid workers standing outside the clinic discussed reports of fighting between the Russian military and the Wagner group.</p><p>“Yeah, let them beat each other up,” Halyna Tereshchenko, 71, a woman sitting nearby, said, clearly satisfied. “Let them leave us alone.”</p></div></div></div></section></div></div>
