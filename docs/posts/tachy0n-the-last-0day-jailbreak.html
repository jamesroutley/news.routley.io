<p>The last 0day jailbreak.</p>

<h2 id="0-introduction">0. Introduction</h2>

<p>Hey.</p>

<p>Now, <em>tachy0n</em>. This is an old exploit, for iOS 13.0 through 13.5, released in <a href="https://unc0ver.dev/">unc0ver</a> v5.0.0 on May 23rd, 2020, exactly 5 years ago today. It was a fairly standard kernel LPE for the time, but one thing that made it noteworthy is that it was dropped as an 0day, affecting the latest iOS version at the time, leading Apple to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/103795">release a patch</a> for just this bug a week later. This is something that used to be common a decade ago, but has become extremely rare - so rare, in fact, that is has never happened again after this.</p>

<p>In early 2020, <a href="https://github.com/pwn20wndstuff">Pwn20wnd</a> (a jailbreak author, not to be confused with Pwn2Own, the event) contacted me, saying he had found an 0day reachable from the app sandbox, and was asking whether I’d be willing to write an exploit for it. At the time I had been working on <a href="https://checkra.in">checkra1n</a> for a couple of months, so I figured going back to kernel research was a welcome change of scenery, and I agreed. But where did this bug come from? It was extremely unlikely that someone would’ve just sent him this bug for free, with no strings attached. And despite being a jailbreak author, he wasn’t doing security research himself, so it was equally unlikely that he would discover such a bug. And yet, he did.</p>

<p>Because, you see: this has happened before. On iOS 12, <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2019/12/sockpuppet-walkthrough-of-kernel.html">SockPuppet</a> was one of the big exploits used by jailbreaks. It was found and reported to Apple by <a href="https://github.com/nedwill">Ned Williamson</a> from Project Zero, patched by Apple in iOS 12.3, and subsequently unrestricted on the Project Zero bug tracker. But against all odds, it then resurfaced on iOS 12.4, as if it had never been patched. I can only speculate that this was because Apple likely forked XNU to a separate branch for that version and had failed to apply the patch there, but this made it evident that they had no regression tests for this kind of stuff. A gap that was both easy and potentially very rewarding to fill. And indeed, after implementing regression tests for just a few known 1days, Pwn got a hit.</p>

<p>So just for a moment, forget everything you know about kheap separation, forget all the task port mitigations, forget SSV and SPTM… and let’s look at some stuff from the good old times.</p>

<h2 id="1-lightspeed">1. Lightspeed</h2>

<p>First, a quick recap on this bug. This is the <a href="https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/lightspeed-a-race-for-an-iosmacos-sandbox-escape.html">Lightspeed</a> bug from Synacktiv (CVE-2020-9859 and possibly CVE-2018-4344). It’s in the <code>lio_listio</code> syscall, which lets you do asynchronous and/or batched file I/O. To keep track of all submitted I/O ops, the kernel allocates this struct:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>aio_lio_context</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>int</span>     <span>io_waiter</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span>     <span>io_issued</span><span>;</span>
    <span>int</span>     <span>io_completed</span><span>;</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The actual work is then performed on a separate thread, which is also responsible for freeing this struct once all I/O has been completed (in <code>do_aio_completion</code>):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/* Are we done with this lio context? */</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>lio_context</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>io_issued</span> <span>==</span> <span>lio_context</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>io_completed</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>lastLioCompleted</span> <span>=</span> <span>TRUE</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>/*
 * free the LIO context if the last lio completed and no thread is
 * waiting
 */</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>lastLioCompleted</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>(</span><span>waiter</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>free_lio_context</span><span>(</span><span>lio_context</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But in the case where <em>nothing</em> has been scheduled at all, that code path will never be hit, and so the <em>current</em> thread has to free this struct again, right from <code>lio_listio</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>case</span> <span>LIO_NOWAIT</span><span>:</span>
    <span>/* If no IOs were issued must free it (rdar://problem/45717887) */</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>lio_context</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>io_issued</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>free_context</span> <span>=</span> <span>TRUE</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>break</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>free_context</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>free_lio_context</span><span>(</span><span>lio_context</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The problem is just that this check is racy. If work <em>has</em> been submitted to the other thread, but it has <em>already completed</em> by the time this check runs, then <code>lio_context</code> is a dangling pointer here. You can check the <a href="https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/lightspeed-a-race-for-an-iosmacos-sandbox-escape.html">original blog post</a> for more details, but in order to exploit this, we want the following sequence of events:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>lio_listio</code> allocates <code>lio_context</code>.</li>
  <li>The work completes and <code>do_aio_completion</code> frees <code>lio_context</code>.</li>
  <li>We reallocate the freed memory with something we control, such that <code>lio_context-&gt;io_issued == 0</code>.</li>
  <li><code>lio_listio</code> sees <code>lio_context-&gt;io_issued == 0</code> and frees our allocated object.</li>
  <li>We reallocate it again with something else, and now have two entirely different allocations pointing to the same memory.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, we’re targeting 64-bit devices here, where the smallest zone is <code>kalloc.16</code>, which is where our <code>lio_context</code> goes. Two things help us massively here:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Before iOS 14, allocations of all types shared the same allocation site, only bucketed by object size. So C++ objects, pointer arrays, user-provided data buffers - all in the same place and able to reallocate each other’s memory, giving us many targets to work with.</li>
  <li>Normally with a double free, it’s crucial to get a reallocation step in between the two frees, because otherwise you hit some unrecoverable disaster state. But in our case, once submitted, <code>lio_context-&gt;io_issued</code> never hits zero while allocated, and once it’s freed, the allocator on the OS versions we’re looking at will overwrite the first 8 bytes with a canary value XOR’ed with either the freelist pointer (zalloc) or the object’s address itself (zcache). Thus, the double free <em>only</em> happens if the object is reallocated in between the two frees, and has bytes 4 through 7 zeroed out! And while it <em>can</em> happen that something else on the system snatches the allocation away from under us and zeroes out the necessary bytes to trigger the double free, in practice this is very unlikely, so we’re able to retry this race many times until we get it right.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="2-spice">2. Spice</h2>

<p>As mentioned, this bug had been exploited before, by a team that I was part of. That was in the <a href="https://github.com/JakeBlair420/Spice">Spice</a> jailbreak/untether together with <a href="https://github.com/PsychoTea">Sparkey</a> and <a href="https://github.com/littlelailo">littlelailo</a>, under our jailbreak team <a href="https://github.com/JakeBlair420">Jake Blair</a>. This targeted iOS 11.x and was written at a time when iOS 13.x was latest, so some things were different than on 13.x and we had some 1days to work with, but a lot of concepts still apply. And while exploitation from racoon has already been documented in <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-11034-tales_of_old_untethering_ios_11#t=1185">lailo’s 36C3 talk</a>, that’s only half the story. Because originally, our planned installation flow was like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.siguza.net/tachy0n/assets/img/1-Spice-flow.png" alt="Spice install flow"/></p>

<p>So we actually had two different variants of the kernel exploit: one for the app and one for racoon. Lailo’s talk details the one from racoon, but that has some important differences to the one from the app. Because while racoon runs as root, it has a much tighter sandbox than normal apps.</p>

<p>Our goal was the same in both cases: mach port forgery. If you were doing kernel exploitation before iOS 14, this was just the meta. Everyone and their mom was doing it, it’s been explained in detail many, many times so I’m not gonna rehash it here, but fact is: if you could get a user-supplied value interpreted as a pointer to a mach port, it was game over. And doing that was actually very straightforward with lightspeed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Trigger the first free of <code>lio_context</code>.</li>
  <li>Spray mach messages with an OOL mach ports descriptor of size 1 or 2 whose first entry is <code>MACH_PORT_NULL</code>. This got placed in <code>kalloc.16</code> and <code>MACH_PORT_NULL</code> is <code>0</code>, so it set <code>lio_context-&gt;io_issued</code> to <code>0</code>.</li>
  <li>Trigger the second free of <code>lio_context</code> (i.e. our OOL mach ports array).</li>
  <li>Spray controlled data to <code>kalloc.16</code> to replace the mach ports array with fake pointers.</li>
</ol>

<p>The main difficulty here was just getting controlled data at a known address in the kernel, so that you had a fake pointer to spray. For A7 through A9(X) though, this was actually insultingly easy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fakeport</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>kport_t</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>mmap</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>KDATA_SIZE</span><span>,</span> <span>PROT_READ</span> <span>|</span> <span>PROT_WRITE</span><span>,</span> <span>MAP_PRIVATE</span> <span>|</span> <span>MAP_ANON</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>mlock</span><span>((</span><span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>fakeport</span><span>,</span> <span>KDATA_SIZE</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it. There you go, that’s your “kernel” pointer. There’s no PAN, so you can just do userland dereference.</p>

<p>We had a <a href="https://project-zero.issues.chromium.org/issues/42450675">kernel stack infoleak</a> due to uninitialised memory and a <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2018/10/deja-xnu.html">sandbox escape to backboardd</a>, both by Ian Beer. Our plan had been to leverage those to either leak a pointer to shared memory we could write to, place data in the kernel’s <code>__DATA</code> segment, or something of that sort. But we never actually found a suitable target, and because of that the sandbox escape was left unfinished, so A10 and A11 were actually never supported from the app.</p>

<p>But the racoon side looks different, on a couple of fronts. First off, spraying controlled data is actually not as easy as it sounds. The common strategy for this was to hit <code>OSUnserializeXML</code> for rapid bulk unserialisation into virtually any chosen zone, and doing so via <code>IOSurface::setValue</code>, which additionally allowed replacing and removing individual properties at will later. But of course, racoon doesn’t have access to IOSurface, so we had to think of something else. Basically the only part of IOKit it has access to is <code>RootDomainUserClient</code>, and that just so happened to contain this bit in <code>RootDomainUserClient::secureSleepSystemOptions</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>unserializedOptions</span> <span>=</span> <span>OSDynamicCast</span><span>(</span><span>OSDictionary</span><span>,</span> <span>OSUnserializeXML</span><span>((</span><span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span><span>)</span><span>inOptions</span><span>,</span> <span>inOptionsSize</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>unserializeErrorString</span><span>));</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>OSDynamicCast</code> there just makes sure that the value returned by <code>OSUnserializeXML</code> is an <code>OSDictionary</code>, otherwise it substitutes it with <code>NULL</code>. In other words, if we unserialise anything that <em>isn’t</em> a dictionary at the top level - like, say, an <code>OSData</code> object - it will fail this check and the pointer to it will be lost, thus the object will be leaked. That’s obviously not great, but for spraying a couple dozen objects, it’s good enough. This is not a vulnerability per se, but it is a bug that Apple subsequently went and fixed.</p>

<p>Another thing that’s different in racoon is sysctls. Because unlike user apps, its sandbox profile allows blanket reading and writing of any sysctl. And unlike user apps, it runs as root, so it actually has the power to modify a whole bunch of sysctl values. And since most of those are globals that are stored in the kernel’s <code>__DATA</code> segment, once you know the kernel slide, putting data at a known address becomes trivial. In our case, we chose <code>vm.swapfileprefix</code> for this, which shouldn’t interfere with anything, at least while the exploit is running.</p>

<p>This was an infoleak in <code>sysctl_procargsx</code> that was patched in iOS 12.1, which allowed you to leak almost an entire page of uninitialised kernel memory from the <code>kernel_map</code>. So whatever objects you could spray and then free again, you could leak. That’s an easy win for both kernel code and heap pointers, and definitely enough to get the kernel slide. Thus, A7-A11 were all taken care of.</p>

<p>All in all, there are much better kernel exploits for iOS 11 today, and the untether was the exciting part anyway.</p>

<h2 id="3-unc0ver">3. unc0ver</h2>

<p>Alright, now onto the real exploit. This time we’re talking A8 through A13, so just yolo’ing it with userland dereferences and ignoring A10+ was no longer an option. I had to work with <em>just</em> this double free.</p>

<p>But another thing I wanted to tackle was a regret that I had from multiple previous exploits I had written. During exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities, there will often be steps that can fail, such as freeing and reallocating some memory, which most of the time will put some object into a corrupted state. Usually that is not immediately fatal, but it will require explicit cleanup in order to preserve system stability, and it also requires going back to an earlier stage in the exploit and performing certain steps again.</p>

<p>To account for this from the beginning, I designed the exploit with two layers. The lower layer starts multiple threads that call into <code>lio_listio</code> and a bunch more threads that unserialize <code>OSData</code> objects via IOSurface to race against it. The default number of threads is 4 freers and 16 racers, but these numbers can be adjusted. The data that is unserialized through IOSurface is an <code>OSDictionary</code> whose entries look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>*</span><span>d</span><span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>kOSSerializeSymbol</span> <span>|</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span>
<span>*</span><span>d</span><span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>sym</span><span>(</span><span>k</span><span>);</span>
<span>*</span><span>d</span><span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>kOSSerializeData</span> <span>|</span> <span>0x10</span><span>;</span>
<span>*</span><span>d</span><span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x41414141</span><span>;</span>  <span>// io_waiter, ignored</span>
<span>*</span><span>d</span><span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>           <span>// io_issued, must be 0</span>
<span>*</span><span>d</span><span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>0x69696969</span><span>;</span>  <span>// io_completed, ignored</span>
<span>*</span><span>d</span><span>++</span> <span>=</span> <span>k</span><span>;</span>           <span>// padding</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><sup>(If you’re unfamiliar with this, this is just the OSSerializeBinary format. See <code>OSUnserializeBinary</code> in XNU. And <code>sym()</code> is just a function I wrote to transpose an arbitrary <code>uint32_t</code> into one without any null bytes.)</sup></p>

<p>More about this in a minute. Since each unserialisation call will create many such objects and since we just spam this call from multiple threads, it is highly likely that we’ll end up with the following scenario:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>lio_context</code> is freed.</li>
  <li>Its memory is reallocated as <code>OSData</code> buffer.</li>
  <li><code>lio_context</code>/<code>OSData</code> buffer is freed again, creating UaF.</li>
  <li>Its memory is reallocated again as buffer for another <code>OSData</code> object.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus we’ll end up with two <code>OSData</code> objects pointing to the same data buffer. This is where the magic values <code>0x41414141</code> and <code>0x69696969</code> come into play. After our racing, we go through all <code>OSData</code> values in our IOSurface and look at their contents. If any of them <em>don’t</em> have our magic values, then they must have been stolen from us by something else on the system. We’ll mark these for later cleanup and will ignore them for now. Otherwise we’ll move on to the value <code>k</code> at the end of the buffer. This value is linked to the key that the <code>OSData</code> has in the dictionary, which is crucial for letting us figure out whether an overlap occurred. If we look up an object for <code>sym(123)</code> and the value in the buffer at offset 0xc is not <code>123</code>, then we know that this data buffer has been reallocated for another <code>OSData</code> object - and moreover, we know <em>which</em> <code>OSData</code> object, since it contains the value <code>k</code> that lets us look it up on the IOSurface. We can thus create a mapping of overlapping objects via their keys in the dictionary.</p>

<p>So the upper layer gets supplied with overlapping <code>OSData</code> objects, and it can use this later to construct a fake mach port by freeing one of the <code>OSData</code> objects, spraying some mach messages with OOL port descriptors, then freeing the other <code>OSData</code> object, and then reallocating it with a new <code>OSData</code> object that contains a pointer to a fake task port. That part is easy, but once again we’re left with the problem of needing to leak a kernel address at which we can put controlled data. But with the aforementioned steps, we can actually leak some heap addresses already. All we have to do is read the <code>OSData</code> contents after the first reallocation as OOL ports descriptor array, and we get the raw kernel pointers of whatever mach ports we send in the OOL descriptor. We’re gonna use that later to leak the addresses of our task port and our service port to <code>IOSurfaceRoot</code> to make the rest of the exploit easier, but that’s beyond the scope of this write-up. Now, we <em>could</em> spray a lot of mach ports, leak their addresses until we have a full page that we hold all references to, free them all, and then try and trigger a zone garbage collection to get the memory into a different zone, but that is slow, expensive and annoying to get right. The same problem applies to <code>OSContainer</code> objects, and pretty much all other pointer arrays you can think of that you could get into <code>kalloc.16</code>. It would be so much easier if we could just get the address of a buffer whose contents we control into <code>kalloc.16</code>… something like shared memory, or so. But such things are rare.</p>

<p>After looking through XNU sources for a couple of days though, I did find a possible candidate: <code>IOMemoryDescriptor</code>. It has a field called <code>_ranges</code>, which is an array of <code>IOVirtualRange</code>, which is literally just:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span><span>{</span>
    <span>IOVirtualAddress</span>    <span>address</span><span>;</span>
    <span>IOByteCount</span>         <span>length</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>IOVirtualRange</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A single one of those fits <em>perfectly</em> into <code>kalloc.16</code>. There’s just one catch: if there is only a single range, then <code>IOMemoryDescriptor</code> points the <code>_ranges</code> field at another field <code>_singleRange</code> instead and saves on doing a heap allocation. There is no way to reach that code path in <code>IOMemoryDescriptor</code> with just one range. However, a <em>subclass</em> of <code>IOMemoryDescriptor</code>, <code>IOBufferMemoryDescriptor</code>, does exactly that, explicitly:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>_ranges</span><span>.</span><span>v64</span> <span>=</span> <span>IONew</span><span>(</span><span>IOAddressRange</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<div><div><pre><code><span>_ranges</span><span>.</span><span>v64</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>address</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>mach_vm_address_t</span><span>)</span> <span>_buffer</span><span>;</span>
<span>_ranges</span><span>.</span><span>v64</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>length</span>  <span>=</span> <span>_capacity</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now all we need is a place in the kernel where we can allocate an <code>IOBufferMemoryDescriptor</code> at will and also get it mapped into our address space. One convenient place for this is the AGX interface, aka. <code>IOAcceleratorFamily2</code> (note that this has since been refactored into <code>IOGPUFamily</code> in iOS 14, so the details here only apply to 13.x and older).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open an <code>IOAccelContext2</code>.</li>
  <li>Grab the next two overlapping <code>OSData</code> objects.</li>
  <li>Free one <code>OSData</code> object.</li>
  <li>Call <code>IOConnectAddClient()</code> on our <code>IOAccelContext2</code> with an <code>IOAccelSharedUserClient2</code> that we opened earlier, outside of the loop.</li>
  <li>Read back the other <code>OSData</code> object and check if the first 8 bytes are a plausible page-aligned kernel pointer and the second 8 bytes are <code>0x8000</code>.</li>
  <li>If we found that, break out of the loop, otherwise close the <code>IOAccelContext2</code> and continue with the loop.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now we can map the memory descriptor into our process and know its kernel address, but we’ve actually still got one problem: the memory is created as pageable (with <code>kIOMemoryPageable</code>), and since we’re gonna be forging a mach port and a task object here, these data structures may end up in situations where preemption is disabled, so we really want to fault those pages in on the kernel side. Once again, I don’t know what the code in question is actually supposed to do, but I figured out that I could trigger this by calling into <code>IOAccelContext2::processSidebandBuffer</code>, which is called indirectly from <code>IOAccelContext2::submit_data_buffers</code>, which is external method 2. So just call this twice with the right data structures prepared on shared memory. <code>::processSidebandBuffer()</code> reads this structure from <code>0x10</code> bytes off the start of shared memory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>uint16_t</span> <span>tok</span><span>;</span>
    <span>uint16_t</span> <span>len</span><span>;</span>
    <span>uint32_t</span> <span>val</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first is some magic, the second is the length divided by 4, and <code>val</code> is some value whose significance I don’t know. All we care about is that the first structure we place on shared memory is valid (<code>tok == 0x100</code> works) and spans an entire page, so that <code>::processSidebandBuffer()</code> advances to the second page and faults it in. After that, it can error out, so on the second page we can put whatever. And with that, we now have controlled data at a known kernel address, which we can directly read and write to.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only noteworthy thing at this point is the bypassing of <code>zone_require</code>, but even that should be well-known to anyone who was around during the iOS 13 days. <code>zone_require</code> was just completely broken by the fact that it allowed pages from outside the <code>zone_map</code>, where it would simply take the first <code>0x20</code> bytes of the page as page metadata, so all you had to do was populate that with the right zone index, and you had just minted yourself a pass for any zone of your choosing. This is also why we need two pages: one for tasks and one for mach ports.</p>

<p>This tiny bit of info was actually the only reason I had to not publish the exploit right away. But alas, it is <a href="https://github.com/Siguza/tachy0n">public on GitHub</a> now at last.</p>

<h2 id="4-aftermath">4. Aftermath</h2>

<p>The scene obviously took note of a full 0day exploit dropping for the latest signed version. <a href="https://github.com/bazad">Brandon Azad</a>, who worked for Project Zero at the time, went full throttle, <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/07/how-to-unc0ver-0-day-in-4-hours-or-less.html">figured out the vulnerability within four hours</a> and informed Apple of his findings. Six days after the exploit dropped, <a href="https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/return-of-the-ios-sandbox-escape-lightspeeds-back-in-the-race.html">Synacktiv published a new blog post</a> where they noted how the original fix in iOS 12 introduced a memory leak, and speculated that it was an attempt to fix this memory leak that brought back the original bug (which I think is quite likely). 9 days after the exploit dropped, Apple released a patch, and I got some private messages from people telling me that this time they’d made sure that the bug would stay dead. They even added <a href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu/blob/main/tests/fd_aio_fsync_uaf.c">a regression test for it to XNU</a>. And finally, 54 days after the exploit dropped, a reverse-engineered version dubbed “tardy0n” was shipped in the Odyssey jailbreak, also targeting iOS 13.0 through 13.5. But by then, the novelty of it had already worn off, WWDC 2020 had already taken place, and the world had shifted its attention to iOS 14 and the changes ahead.</p>

<p>And oh boy did things change. iOS 14 represented a strategy shift from Apple. Until then, they had been playing whack-a-mole with first-order primitives, but not much beyond. The <code>kernel_task</code> restriction and <code>zone_require</code> were feeble attempts at stopping an attacker when it was already way too late. Had a heap overflow? Over-release on a C++ object? Type confusion? Pretty much no matter the initial primitive, the next target was always mach ports, and from there you could just grab a dozen public exploits on the net and plug their second half into your code.</p>

<p>Perhaps the single biggest change was to the allocators, <code>kalloc</code> and <code>zalloc</code>. Many decades ago, CPU vendors started shipping a feature called “Data Execution Prevention” because people understood that separating data and code has security benefits. Apple did the same here, but with data and <em>pointers</em> instead. They butchered up the zone map and split it into multiple ranges, dubbed “kheaps”. The exact amount and purpose of the different kheaps has changed over time, but one crucial point is that user-controlled data would go into <em>one</em> heap, kernel objects into <em>another</em>. For kernel objects, they also implemented “sequestering”, which means that once a given page of the virtual address range is allocated to a given zone, it will <em>never</em> be used for anything else again until the system reboots. The physical memory can be released and detached if all objects on the page are freed, but the virtual memory range will not be reused for different objects, effectively killing kernel object type confusions. Add in some random guard pages, some per-boot randomness in where different zones will start allocating, and it’s effectively no longer possible to do cross-zone attacks with any reliability. Of course this wasn’t perfect from the start, and some user-controlled data still made it into the kernel object heap and vice versa, but this has been refined and hardened over time, to the point where clang now has some <code>__builtin_xnu_*</code> features to carry over some compile-time type information to runtime to help with better isolation between different data types.</p>

<p>But the allocator wasn’t the only thing that changed, it was the approach to security as a whole. Apple no longer just patches bugs, they patch <em>strategies</em> now. You were spraying kmsg structs as a memory corruption target as part of your exploit? Well, those are signed now, so that any tampering with them will panic the kernel. You were using pipe buffers to build a stable kernel r/w interface? Too bad, those pointers are PAC’ed now. Virtually any time you used an unrelated object as a victim, Apple would go and harden that object type. This obviously made developing exploits much more challenging, to the point where exploitation strategies were soon more valuable than the initial memory corruption 0days.</p>

<h2 id="5-conclusion">5. Conclusion</h2>

<p>It’s insane to think that this was a mere 5 years ago. I think this really serves as an illustration to just how unfathomably fast this field moves. I can’t possibly imagine where we’ll be in 5 years from now.</p>

<p>Finally, I’d like to thank Pwn20wnd for sharing this 0day with me and choosing to drop it as part of a public jailbreak. That was a very cool move. I’d also like to thank whoever unpatched the bug in iOS 13.0. That was a very cool move too. And I’d like to thank everyone that I’ve learned from before these changes hit, and everyone that I’ve worked with afterwards. It wouldn’t have been possible for me to keep doing this alone.</p>

<p>If you have questions, comments, typos, or anything else, I’m just gonna link <a href="https://siguza.net">my website</a> now. Whatever the most up-to-date way to contact me is, it will be linked there.</p>
