Those who stayed and landed a coveted faculty position were more likely to have had a highly cited paper, changed their research topic between their PhD and postdoc, or moved abroad after receiving their doctorate.</p><p>The study, published in <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> on 20 January, looked at researchers around the world who had progressed from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03222-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03222-7" data-track-category="body text link">a PhD</a> to a postdoc — a temporary position for further professional training, development and expanded research — and then, in some cases, on to a faculty position. The study covered 25 years and 19 academic disciplines and used data from<b> </b>Microsoft Academic Graph, a corpus containing 257 million publications. The researchers filtered the data using an online professional network (presumably LinkedIn, although the authors did not say) to match researcher&#39;s curriculum vitaes.</p><p>Previous studies have focused mainly on how important the prestige of PhD-granting institutions is to landing a faculty job<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup>. Bedoor AlShebli, a computational social scientist at New York University Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and her co-authors wanted to fill a gap in the research and quantify the significance of postdoctoral training to gaining a faculty position and early-career success.</p><p>“Our research highlights that the postdoctoral years are just as critical as the PhD years when evaluating a scientist’s likelihood of successfully entering academia and securing a faculty position,” she says.</p><h2>A path to success</h2><p>In many countries, there are more postdocs than <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03251-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03251-8" data-track-category="body text link">faculty positions</a> available. This creates a bottleneck. The team’s data set shows that 41% of postdocs end up <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00198-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00198-0" data-track-category="body text link">leaving academia</a>. AlShebli says that researchers who publish less during their postdoc than they did during their PhD are more likely to leave.</p><p>For researchers who stick around, what determines success? To answer that question the team developed a measure of scientific output — called the <i>η</i>-index — as a proxy for success. This measure is based on the h-index, a count of a researcher’s citations, but focuses only on papers published between two and four years after securing a faculty position.</p></div></div>
