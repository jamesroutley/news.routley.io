    <h1>Kaspersky discloses iPhone hardware feature vital in Operation Triangulation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kaspersky&#39;s GReAT team
        discovered a vulnerability in Apple System on a chip, or SoC, that has played a
        critical role in the recent iPhone attacks, known as Operation Triangulation, allowing
        attackers to bypass the hardware-based memory protection on iPhones running iOS
        versions up to iOS 16.6.</p>



<p>The discovered
        vulnerability is a hardware feature, possibly based on the principle of <em>“</em>security
        through obscurity,” and may have been intended for testing or debugging.
        Following the initial 0-click iMessage attack and subsequent privilege
        escalation, the attackers leveraged this hardware feature to bypass
        hardware-based security protections and manipulate the contents of protected memory
        regions. This step was crucial for obtaining full control over the device. Apple
        addressed the issue, identified as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-38606">CVE-2023-38606</a><u>.</u></p>



<p>As far as Kaspersky is
        aware, this feature was not publicly documented, presenting a significant
        challenge in its detection and analysis using conventional security methods. GReAT
        researchers engaged in extensive reverse engineering, meticulously analyzing
        the iPhone&#39;s hardware and software integration, particularly focusing on the
        Memory-Mapped I/O, or MMIO, addresses, which are critical for facilitating
        efficient communication between the CPU and peripheral devices in the system. Unknown
        MMIO addresses, used by the attackers to bypass the hardware-based kernel
        memory protection, were not identified in any device tree ranges, presenting a
        significant challenge. The team had to also decipher the intricate workings of
        the SoC and its interaction with the iOS operating system, especially regarding
        memory management and protection mechanisms. This process involved a thorough
        examination of various device tree files, source codes, kernel images, and
        firmware, in a quest to find any reference to these MMIO addresses. </p>



<p><em>“This is no ordinary
            vulnerability. Due to the closed nature of the iOS ecosystem, the discovery
            process was both challenging and time-consuming, requiring a comprehensive
            understanding of both hardware and software architectures. What this discovery
            teaches us once again is that even advanced hardware-based protections can be
            rendered ineffective in the face of a sophisticated attacker, particularly when
            there are hardware features allowing to bypass these protections,”</em> <em>comments
            Boris Larin, Principal Security Researcher at Kaspersky’s GReAT.</em></p>



<p>“Operation
        Triangulation” is an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) campaign targeting iOS
        devices, <a href="https://securelist.com/operation-triangulation/109842/">uncovered</a> by
        Kaspersky earlier this summer. This sophisticated campaign employs zero-click
        exploits distributed via iMessage, enabling attackers to gain complete control
        over the targeted device and access user data. Apple responded by releasing
        security updates to address four zero-day vulnerabilities identified by
        Kaspersky researchers: CVE-2023-32434, CVE-2023-32435, CVE-2023-38606, and
        CVE-2023-41990. These vulnerabilities impact a broad spectrum of Apple
        products, including iPhones, iPods, iPads, macOS devices, Apple TV, and Apple
        Watch. Kaspersky also informed Apple about the exploitation of the hardware
        feature, leading to its subsequent mitigation by the company.</p>

        Operation Triangulation and the technical details behind the analysis, read the
