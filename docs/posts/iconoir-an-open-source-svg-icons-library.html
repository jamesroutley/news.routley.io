<p>A marvelous thing about complex music and dance is getting to witness the things humans can achieve. I find myself transported when I watch a big song-and-dance number in a filmed musical, or watch a video of <a href="https://gallusrostromegalus.tumblr.com/post/671291611189297152/what-instruments-do-you-play-him-yes-tiktok">a musician doing a cool stunt like layering many of their performances together into a single recording</a>.</p><p>And I realized today that this is particularly meaningful to me now as I see my civilization demonstrate that it cannot achieve some things that it used to. It is nearly impossible for us to build what we used to build. But we can still make intricate art.</p>
