    <h1>Ask HN: Any good tools for viewing congressional bills?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I was interested in skimming through the &#34;Big Beautiful Bill&#34; and I found the contents of it on congress.gov[1].</p><p>It comes in two formats:
One is a text document with with column size restrictions that makes it very hard to read, worse than the text version of an IETF RFC.
The second is a machine readable XML document which itself isn&#39;t easily read.</p><p>Are there any good tools for viewing these? I did find GovTrack.us but it seems to be down so I&#39;m not sure if it solves this problem.</p><p>[1]: https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text</p></div></div></div>
