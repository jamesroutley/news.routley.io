    <h1>Ask HN: Seeking ideas for preschool/school projects</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m reaching out for some creative suggestions. I have a 4-year-old and a 7-year-old attending preschool/school, and both sets of teachers have asked for ideas from parents for skills they could show or projects they could help with in the classroom.</p><p>I have a background in computer science, primarily focused on web development these days. Additionally, I have loads of potentially useful toys at home, including a 3D printer, DIY CNC mill, webcams, Raspberry Pis, old laptops, etc.</p><p>What are some engaging activities or projects I could bring to either level of the schools that would be both fun and educational for the kids? Particularly ideas we could do as a class vs breaking into smaller groups.</p><p>I have had a couple of ideas so far
- Processing based art interactive which the kids can suggest updates for and instantly see the changes.
- Something RTLSDR based, so we can play with antennas and catch some radio waves.</p><p>Looking forward to your creative ideas and suggestions, thank you.</p></div></div></div>
