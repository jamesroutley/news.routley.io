	  <h3>Group #1: Digging Hoes</h3> 
	  <p> The first (and oldest) style are the ones that started way back when agriculture began. 
	      They are used to chop through sod to make a garden space. They are also used to keep that soil tilled up and loose.
	  </p>
	  
	  <div>
	    <div>
	      <p> These tools typically have a heavy blade or tines that chops into the soil at a 45 degree angle. 
		      The handle makes about an 80 degree angle with the blade. 
	          The heavy weight is important because it builds momentum as the tool swings downward,and helps them easily penetrate the soil. 
		      <em>*Note - remember this paragraph because it also explains why part of the &#34;Draw&#34; category below is hard to use.</em> 
	      </p>
	      <p> It is best to chop thin slices of sod or soil (an inch or two) and then pull the handle back towards you to move or till the slice. 
		      (See our 
			  <nobr><a href="https://www.easydigging.com/garden-hoes/articles/how-to-use-grub-hoe.html">How to Use a Grub Hoe</a></nobr> article)
	      </p>
		  <p> Although these tasks can now also be done with a plow or rototiller, these tools are still used here and around the world by 
	      those practicing small-scale agriculture, and by normal gardeners who want to avoid the cost and hassles of gas powered equipment.

	<div id="draw">

	  <h3>Group #2: Draw Hoes</h3> 
	  
	  <p> This group contains the ones that people are most familiar. If you ask someone to sketch a “garden hoe”, this is what you will get. </p>
	  <p> The word &#34;draw&#34; also means &#34;to pull&#34;. These tools are used by pulling or drawing them towards you. The blade scrapes at or below the the soil surface.
	      If scraping at the surface, the blade will rip or slice the weed stems. If scraping below the surface, it will uproot the weeds.
	  </p>
	  
	  <div>
	    <div>
	      <p> The hoe head is light - it does not need to be heavy, because this design is not meant for digging deep into the soil. </p>
	      <p> The blade should contact the soil at a 20 to 30 degree angle, which is optimal for scraping. 
	          And the angle between the blade and handle should be about 60 degrees, plus or minus depending on the handle length and your height. 
	    	  <em>And here is where the trouble starts...</em>
	      </p>
	      <p> <strong>The trouble, or problem, with many Draw Hoes is that people do not adjust the neck of the hoe.</strong> 
	          The &#34;neck&#34; is the rod that connects the blade to the handle. 
			  The only reason the neck is there is to allow the user to allow to fine tune the tool so that the end of the handle 
			  is at comfortable level for their height, AND AT THE SAME TIME allow the blade to make the proper angle with the soil.

    <!-- reciprocating hoes / updated 10/27/2022 -->
	<div id="recipro">
	  <hr/>
	    
	  <h2>Group #3: Reciprocating Hoes</h2> 
	  <p> This group is the only ones with moving parts. 
	      The narrow blade has a pivot that lets it easily skim across the top of the soil on the forward stroke,
		  then scrape and churn through the soil at a shallow angle (20 degrees) as you pull the hoe backward. 
		  The shallow angle will cut smaller weeds and uproot the rest. 
	  </p>
      <p> Heavily built versions can used pretty aggressively for preparing soil or weeding between the rows. 
	      While lighter models are used close to crop plants to weed the uppermost layer of soil without damaging your crop&#39;s roots.
	  </p>
	  <p> Most hoes in this category of hoe do not have an adjustable handle angle. 
	      So for those, a proper starting design and a long handle are critical. Try before you buy. 
	      But there is one, called the Switchblade Hoe, that does have a fully adjustable handle and interchangeable heads.
	  </p>
	  </div>  
	  	  
	<!-- flat hoes -->
	<div id="flat">
	  <hr/>
	    
	  <h2>Group #4: Flat Hoes</h2> 
	  <p> I called these &#34;flat&#34; because the blades lay parallel to the soil surface. They are moved back and forth just under the soil surface to cut or uproot small weeds. 
	      They are not meant for hard or baked soil, though you could loosen such soil first with a Tined Draw Hoe and then use a flat hoe to finish it up.
	  </p>
	  <p> These come in almost every geometric shape. The edges are either sharp or saw-toothed. 
	      Beware of claims of &#34;Self-Sharpening&#34; - rubbing a tool around in the dirt never sharpens it.
	  </p>
	  <p> The blade must lay flat on the ground while holding the handle in a comfortable position. 
	      So it is important to pick one that has an adjustable neck.

	<!-- sweeping hoes -->
	<div id="sweep">
	  <hr/>
	    
	  <h2>Group #5: Sweeping Hoes</h2> 
	  <p> This group is the most modern, and their invention is usually credited to Eliot Coleman from the 1980&#39;s, but some of the versions 
	      were developed by other people in other countries. 
	  </p>
	  <p> They are used with the handle held fairly upright, with your thumbs pointing upwards and the blade (or the wire) near your feet. The blade is swept 
	      back and forth in short strokes to cut or uproot small weeds. Looking straight down at the blade allows more accuracy when working close to your crops.
