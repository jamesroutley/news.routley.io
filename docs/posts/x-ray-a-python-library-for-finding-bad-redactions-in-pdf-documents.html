    </header><p>Statistically speaking, if you’re reading this, it’s unlikely you know anyone who voted for Eric Adams (“America’s Mayor”) in 2025.</p>
<p>If you live in New York, there’s even a good chance that you voted in one of the 1,430 electoral districts that had zero votes for Eric Adams (33.5% of the city.)</p>
<p>But the other 66.5% exists.</p>
<p>While Eric Adams officially dropped out of the mayoral race on September 28th, this was well after the May 30 deadline to remove a name from the general election ballot. And thus, Eric Adams, of the “Safe&amp;Affordable/EndAntiSemitism” party, remained on the ballot to receive 6,897 votes across the five boroughs.</p>
<p>But where were Eric Adams’ strongest soldiers? Despite some <a href="https://www.electionatlas.nyc/maps.html">great maps</a> of the election results, none made it easy for me to answer this simple question.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Election District 52090, with the highest citywide Eric Adams support at 20%. Of the 5 of you who voted, one did so for Adams.</p>
