<p>Upward Farms, a US vertical-farming business, has thrown in the towel ten years after the company was founded in New York under a different identity.</p>



<p>The company started out in 2013 as Edenworks before transitioning to Seed &amp; Roe and then Upward Farms. Employing aquaponics technology to cultivate microgreens such as kale and mustard, the controlled-environment agriculture business was supplying Whole Foods Market in the New York City area.</p>



<p>Getting off the ground with a farm in Brooklyn, in 2020 Upward Farms revealed a new growing facility in the same borough. At the time, the company said it had just received $15m in fresh funding, including from Wyoming-based venture-capital investor Prime Movers Lab, taking financing to $20m.</p>



<p>“It is with a heavy heart that we are announcing that Upward Farms is closing its Brooklyn headquarters farm and will cease to operate in the vertical-farming sector,” founders Jason Green, Ben Silverman and Matthew La Rosa wrote on the opening page of their website.</p>



<p>“We found that vertical farming is almost infinitely complex – as we tackled challenges, new ones emerged.”</p>



<p>Vertical or indoor controlled-environment farming is capital intensive, requiring external funds to finance the technology and running costs, including artificial lighting in some cases to supplement daylight. Most, if not all, <a href="https://www.just-food.com/analysis/indoor-farming-and-the-prospects-for-profitability/">companies involved in the sector are unprofitable</a> in what is still a relatively nascent industry requiring scale and investment to remain viable and compete with traditionally grown crops.</p>



<p>One such business is Germany’s Infarm, which last November announced a <a href="https://www.just-food.com/news/infarm-jobs-to-go-as-vertical-farmer-consolidates/">restructuring to scale back operations</a> in the UK, France and the Netherlands due to what it called “challenging market conditions”, including rising energy costs. Co-founder and CEO Erez Galonska <a href="https://www.just-food.com/interviews/mega-challenges-uproot-vertical-farming-push-from-niche-to-mainstream-infarm-ceo-erez-galonska/">conceded in a May 2022 interview</a> with <em>Just Food</em> that the company was not turning a profit.</p>



<p>Future Crops, a joint Israeli-Dutch operation in the Netherlands, reportedly went bankrupt earlier this year, although<em> Just Food</em> was unable to verify the start-up’s demise at the time. </p>



<p>Agricool in France also <a href="https://www.just-food.com/news/french-indoor-farming-firm-agricool-looks-for-buyer-after-calling-in-receivers/">threw in the towel last year</a>, citing “insufficient turnover to finance the high structural costs”, along with the “lack of volumes necessary to achieve an operating balance”.</p>



<p>Upward Farms, meanwhile, was also rearing what it called “hybrid striped” bass at its Brooklyn farm. In January 2022, the business announced it planned to build a new 250,000-square-foot facility in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, without revealing the cost.</p>



<p>The farm, to be constructed through 2022 and ready for completion “early” in 2023, was to add capacity for its microgreens and fish amid a plan for Upward Farms to target new customers beyond New York City.</p>



<p>“Scale, productivity, and efficiency in the industry have remained limited by biology,” Upward Farms said in a statement unveiling the capital investment, with an explanation around the technology the company employed.</p>



<p>“What Upward Farms calls Ecological Intelligence is a proprietary microbiome technology that introduces a biologically-based reinforcement learning flywheel. By curating a diverse microbiome with genetic capacity for key functions, Upward Farms achieves an autonomous, self-optimising, and highly productive biological manufacturing platform.”</p>
