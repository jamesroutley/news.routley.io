But there’s a big dollop of sincerity too.  Elon Musk genuinely feels that advertisers are a threat to free speech.  Why?  Because many advertisers </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/technology/elon-musk-twitter-x-advertisers.html" rel="">fled X after Musk eagerly endorsed a bigot’s articulation of anti-Semitic theories, including that Jews promote hatred of whites and that Jews are importing “hordes of minorities.”</a><span>  Unsurprisingly, many companies aren’t cool with that.  That’s a mix of corporate leadership thinking that such bigotry is bad business and thinking that it’s immoral.</span></p><p>Private companies have a First Amendment right to make such a decision.  They have the right to express their values — and choose their marketing strategy — by deciding what kind of media content to promote.  They have freedom of association to refrain from advertising on platforms that repulse their customers.  Those rights are held both by the corporate advertisers and by the individuals making decisions for them.  Elon Musk’s sullen yawp amounts to a claim that he has a right for companies to sponsor his speech, no matter what he says.  That’s nonsense, both legally and philosophically.</p><p><span>It doesn’t stop there.  Musk is also a fan of the theory that when he speaks, your criticism of him violates his rights.  His latest articulation of this theory came after </span><a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/x-placing-ads-amazon-nba-mexico-nbcuniversal-and-others-next-content-white-nationalist" rel="">Media Matters published an article claiming that X is running ads for prominent companies next to bigoted content on X.</a><span>  Musk responded with an extravagant, mostly incoherent threat to file a “thermonuclear” lawsuit against Media Matters and its board and donors “to protect free speech,” whose criticism “seeks to undermine freedom of expression on our platform.”</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7247b31d-4f76-423c-8297-346d236592b8_1216x1542.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7247b31d-4f76-423c-8297-346d236592b8_1216x1542.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7247b31d-4f76-423c-8297-346d236592b8_1216x1542.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7247b31d-4f76-423c-8297-346d236592b8_1216x1542.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7247b31d-4f76-423c-8297-346d236592b8_1216x1542.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7247b31d-4f76-423c-8297-346d236592b8_1216x1542.jpeg" width="1216" height="1542" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/7247b31d-4f76-423c-8297-346d236592b8_1216x1542.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1542,&#34;width&#34;:1216,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:977985,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/jpeg&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7247b31d-4f76-423c-8297-346d236592b8_1216x1542.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7247b31d-4f76-423c-8297-346d236592b8_1216x1542.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7247b31d-4f76-423c-8297-346d236592b8_1216x1542.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7247b31d-4f76-423c-8297-346d236592b8_1216x1542.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Last Friday night Musk announced that X would sue Media Matters “the split second court opens on Monday.”  I’m confident that Musk’s obliging attorney, </span><a href="https://www.quinnemanuel.com/attorneys/spiro-alex/" rel="">Alex Spiro</a><span>, knows that complaints in both San Francisco County Superior Court and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California may be electronically filed 24/7 these days.  In fact I’m confident he has e-filing accounts for both courts.  It may be Mr. Spiro didn’t see fit to tell that to Elon Musk Friday night.  One sympathizes.  Mr. Spire’s firm Quinn Emmanuel is as crowded with former federal prosecutors as a judicial convention, and carefully cultivates its reputation for being almost as good as it thinks it is. They’re excellent trial lawyers; just look at their advertisement saying so on the concourse at Burbank Airport.</span></p><p>Some might suggest that suing journalists to defend free speech sounds Orwellian and even unhinged.

That’s not happening.  If anything, the dialogue is getting muddier.

Elon Musk’s gripe that advertisers are attacking free speech, and that journalists are infringing speech by criticizing it, has become perfectly plausible to many Americans.  In my view, too many critics of “cancel culture” are recklessly promoting not the speech of the powerless, but the censorious resentment of the powerful.</p></div></div></div></div>
