					<h3>September  8, 2025</h3>
					<p>Yesterday <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adriansdigitalbasement.com/post/3lyb6knf4qs2t">I saw this Bluesky post from Adrian Black</a>. He runs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@adriansdigitalbasement">Adrian’s Digital Basement</a>, a retro computer repair channel I really enjoy. In the post, he points out a trend I didn’t know about: YouTube views seem to have fallen off a cliff recently.</p>

<p>Further down the thread, <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2025/youtube-views-are-down-dont-panic">Jeff Geerling linked to a blog post on the subject</a>. Geerling is another technology YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffGeerling">whose work I enjoy</a>. He’s also seen a large drop in views. In that post, Geerling shares some data: while views are down, likes and revenue have been mostly steady. He guesses that this might be caused by a change in how views are calculated, but it’s just a guess. YouTube hasn’t mentioned anything about a change, and the drop in views has been going on for about a month.</p>

<p>Geerling also notes that many people on YouTube are paid by sponsors, and those sponsors use recent video views as a key metric. If this change has happened suddenly and there’s no official word from YouTube, how are YouTube creators supposed to convince sponsors to re-adjust expectations?</p>

<p>Today I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5-b7v6EIzc">a video by the RedLetterMedia folks on this topic</a>. If you’re not familiar with their work, be warned that the video is vulgar and juvenile (sorry, I love their stuff). They’re blaming the change on <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/174084">Restricted Mode</a>, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtQat5HNYrI">definitely not a new feature</a> but seems to have randomly turned on for some people recently. Does this have anything to do with anything? Who knows!</p>

<p>I pay for YouTube Premium. For my money, it’s the best bang-for-the-buck subscription service on the market. I also think that YouTube is a monopoly. There are some alternatives — <a href="https://nebula.tv/">I also pay for Nebula, for example</a> — but they’re tiny in comparison. YouTube is effectively <em>the</em> place to watch video on the internet.</p>

<p>It’s also a place where a lot of people are trying to make a living. YouTube has approximately zero competition where anyone can upload their own videos and monetize them. Now those creators are seeing a key metric decline drastically, and in a way that might affect their bottom line. I tried looking, and couldn’t find any official word about this change. Heck, it might be a bug or some unknown effect that’s only hitting a small portion of the service! Creators are forced to share notes and read tea leaves as weird things happen to their traffic. I can only guess how demoralizing that must feel.</p>

<p>I don’t know what the answer is here. I wish there was a real alternative, but I can’t see that happening soon. I’ll continue to support smaller services like Nebula, but I think most people won’t pay for a service when YouTube is free with ads. I also think it would take some doing to get advertisers to jump on a new platform when YouTube has almost all the viewers.</p>

<p>I think this is a space in real need of competition. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Just because it’s good now doesn’t mean it will always be. However, there are only a handful of companies who could make a go of it… and I think they’d lose a lot of money for a long time while they tried. That really sucks.</p>
