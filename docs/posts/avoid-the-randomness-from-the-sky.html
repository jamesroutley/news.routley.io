            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>This is a plea for cryptography specification authors. If your protocol uses randomness, please <strong>make it a deterministic function that takes a fixed-size string of random bytes</strong>, and publish known-answer tests for it.</p>
<p>This whole issue could really be just the paragraph above, but I feel like I need to at least explain the title. A cryptographer I respect and I had a bit of a running joke: <em>the randomness from the sky</em>. That’s how we called random sampling from arbitrary distributions dropped halfway through a cryptography algorithm, with no concern for how it should be implemented, where the entropy is coming from, what properties it needs to have, the failure modes, and how it will be tested. “It’s… you know, random!” Magic perfect randomness.</p>
<p>That might be ok for theoretical papers that focus on security proofs, but it is very very much not enough for a spec.</p>
<p>The first reason is that the kernel doesn’t give us implementers a “random integer modulo q” API, or a “random point on P-256” API, it gives us a CSPRNG that produces bytes, at best. It’s then up to us to turn those random bytes into a random element of whatever the protocol needs. Trust me, that’s not a job you want to leave to us. Selecting uniform elements is subtle: even for the simplest case of an integer in a range whether you can just reduce a larger value depends on <em>the specific modulo and how larger the value is</em>.</p>
<p>You might argue that it’s tedious to re-specify how to get a random group element from bytes in every higher-level specification, and I agree! That’s why I think that building blocks such as prime order groups should include as part of the abstraction a map from a fixed number of uniform bytes to a uniform element in the group. <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-ristretto255-decaf448-06.html?ref=filippo-valsorda#name-element-derivation">That’s what ristretto255 does.</a></p>
<p>The second, more important reason is testability. Specifying randomness as just another fixed-size input of a deterministic function makes it possible to provide “known answer” test cases. Even if the spec doesn’t include vectors—which it should—other projects like <a href="https://github.com/google/wycheproof?ref=filippo-valsorda">Wycheproof</a> or <a href="https://c2sp.org/CCTV?ref=filippo-valsorda">CCTV</a> can fill the gap over time. Good, shared test vectors can cover edge cases implementors would not have otherwise thought about or tested, stopping bugs from making it into the wild. Instead, we have <a href="https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.20:src/crypto/ecdsa/ecdsa.go;l=206?ref=filippo-valsorda">scary algorithms like ECDSA signing</a> (where nonce selection needs to be 100% perfectly uniform, or the private key is leaked) that have no off-the-shelf test vectors because they are poorly randomized.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to say “just seed a stream cipher and use that as the CSPRNG” but that adopts the internals of the stream cipher, of how it’s instantiated, and how it’s used as a CSPRNG into your protocol, which might be a much worse outcome than a deliberate design. For example, the ZCash Powers of Tau MPC ceremony needed to generate a number of elliptic curve points from a seed, so they just called <code>ChaChaRng::from_seed</code>, got a Rust <code>Rand</code> trait implementation, and passed it down to <code>Fq::Rand</code>. Then they asked me to reimplement the protocol in Go. The result was… <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/powersoftau/blob/e2af113817477d26e6155f1aae478d3cb58d62c5/powersoftau/hash_to_g2.go?ref=filippo-valsorda#L13-L55">fun</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on your protocol, you can probably adopt simpler options than a deterministic CSPRNG anyway. If you need variable but short amounts of randomness, a XOF (extendable-output functions) or HKDF will do. If you need to retry a process, like to do rejection sampling, I like the pattern of hashing (with proper domain separation!) the previous randomness to generate a new candidate. For example, you take a fixed-size random string <code>r</code>, check if <code>truncate(H(r))</code> is in range, if not try <code>truncate(H(H(r)))</code>, and so on.</p>
<p>I saw a neat trick on top of this in the Classic McEliece design: its very large private keys are expanded from a short fixed-size random byte string, but the process has a chance of failure; if the process fails, the string is hashed into a new string, and the process starts over. What’s neat is that only the final string is written to disk to store the private key, removing the need to repeat the whole process next time, but without introducing the need for separate key loading and key generation functions.</p>
