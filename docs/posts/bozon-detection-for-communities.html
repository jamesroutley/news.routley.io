  <p>Every community has some amount of bozo behavior.</p>
<p>Past a certain point, the number of bozos in a community exceed a healthy carrying capacity, and will crowd out or drive away sane and healthy members. No community is without <em>some</em> amount of bozos but it’s easy to find yourself at a circus without realizing it until the clown car pulls up.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to help score your community of choice, each worth one point.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are there consistent attempts to frame things as zero-sum or negative-sum games?</li>
<li>Are requests for “civil” and “polite” behavior constantly dismissed?</li>
<li>Are personal communications used to win arguments without the consent of both parties?</li>
<li>Are large-scale philosophical/political problems given space over technical issues?</li>
<li>Is there an excessive fracturing of official spaces?</li>
<li>Is it common to bring in off-space behavior to attempt to win arguments?</li>
<li>Are there actors that self-exile loudly only to return?</li>
<li>…does (7) happen more than once?</li>
<li>Do new users tend to acculturate, or do they immediately request big changes?</li>
<li>…if (9) is true, do they start drama if the changes don’t occur quickly enough?</li>
<li>Is labeling things as “drama” attacked as unfair/unreasonable/discriminatory?</li>
<li>Is it common practice to complain about community disagreements on the Fediverse/Twitter/social media?</li>
<li>Is it common practice to <em>organize</em> sides about community disagreements on the Fediverse/Twitter/social media?</li>
<li>Is it obvious what the politics of users are?</li>
<li>…if (14) is yes, is it obvious that distribution of politics expressed is significantly different than expected?</li>
<li>…if (14) is yes, is discussion continually derailed by discussions of politics?</li>
<li>Is “everything is political” a common refrain/point made?</li>
<li>Are there factions that will unconditionally back their members, regardless of their behavior?</li>
<li>Is there no code of conduct/values?</li>
<li>Will straightforward application and citing of the code of conduct/values be flagged/moderated?</li>
<li>Do disagreements frequently get reframed as accusations of harms/safety issues?</li>
<li>Do discussions about norms frequently devolve into debating about who gets to decide norms?</li>
<li>Is there a pattern of rules-lawyering?</li>
<li>Do the same conflicts come up over and over again (e.g., vim vs emacs)?</li>
<li>Do the same factions fight over and over again (e.g., last time it was A and B arguing over deployment, this week it’s A and B arguing over tariff policy)?</li>
<li>Is faction membership used to dismiss arguments or points?</li>
<li>Do old arguments/complaints continually get brought up?</li>
<li>Are disagreements frequently reframed from the practical/technical to the moral/ethical?</li>
<li>Are there frequent bad-faith arguments?</li>
<li>…if (29) is true, does this include uncharitable characterization of the opponent?</li>
<li>…if (29) is true, does this include outright lying?</li>
<li>Are moderators not doing their job?</li>
<li>…if (32) is true, is it that they take too long?</li>
<li>…if (32) is true, is it that they are not perpetuating a useful theory of mind for shared norms (e.g., the community can’t reasonably infer coherent norms based on what is and isn’t moderated)?</li>
<li>…if (32) is true, is it that they show clear favoritism?</li>
<li>…if (32) is true, is it that they do not have a clear record of action and deliberation?</li>
<li>…if (32) is true, is it that they don’t have a clear and narrowly-defined job?</li>
<li>Are newcomers not encouraged?</li>
<li>Is creative and productive activity not encouraged?</li>
<li>Does drama get more attention than making things?</li>
<li>Do discussions seem to keep increasing in scope beyond what the community is putatively about?</li>
<li>Do disagreements frequently result on “piling-on” individual members?</li>
<li>…if (42) is true, is it the same folks piling on?</li>
<li>…if (42) is true, does anybody do anything about it?</li>
<li>Are “open letters” airing grievances in the public fora a recognized way of expressing disapproval?</li>
<li>…if (45) is true, do the letters override or influence leadership/moderation?</li>
<li>…if (45) is true, do signatories sometimes or often express regret having joined an earlier letter?</li>
<li>Is there a designated sideshow area for the bozos (e.g., off-topic rooms, politics channels, etc.)</li>
<li>…if (48) is true, does it leak often?</li>
<li>…if (48) is true, do moderators actively enforcement containment?</li>
</ol>
<p>I can’t tell you what the proper breakpoints for you are: you need to decide for yourself on your thresholds.</p>
<p>If you spend enough time with bozos, at some point you’re gonna find yourself in the Big Top whether you want to or not.</p>
