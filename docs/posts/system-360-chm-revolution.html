          <p>In 1960, IBM’s Gene Amdahl was named manager of architecture for their new System/360 family of mainframe computers. Amdahl’s challenge was to design a family of computers that would support a range of speeds and peripherals yet run the same software.
 
The System/360, announced in April of 1964, became IBM&#39;s most profitable product and Amdahl a legendary figure in the industry. Amdahl’s initial S/360 architecture influenced generations of later IBM mainframes, including some available today.</p>

    <h6>The Software</h6>

<p>System/360’s software was also ambitious. Variations of one operating system, OS/360, were supposed to run on all the models.</p>

<p>But OS/360 was hard to write -- especially the complex “multiprogramming” versions that ran several programs at once -- and it was late. Three special OSs had to be created for the smallest machines.</p>  </div><!-- .artifact -->

          <p>Brooks is legendary for having rescued IBM’s floundering software-development program for the first System/360 computers.  When he stepped in, over 1,000 programmers were working on the operating system.</p>

    <h6>The Hardware</h6>

<p>In addition to the underlying principle of compatibility, System/360 incorporated many hardware advances, including options for very large main memories and Solid Logic Technology (hybrid integrated circuits).  </p>

<p>It also used microprogramming, software that implemented some complicated instructions that would otherwise need special hardware – key to making the smaller models do everything.</p>  </div><!-- .artifact -->

      <h6><a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/revolution/mainframe-computers/7/164/579">Erich Bloch, IBM engineer</a></h6>
          <p>Bloch began developing Solid Logic Technology (SLT) miniature hybrid circuits in 1961, before IBM launched the System/360 project.  SLT circuits were critical to System/360s success.</p>
