    <h1>Ask HN: Ads with small budget for personal project?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I&#39;ve been trying for months to bring more traffic to my personal project&#39;s website. I&#39;ve tried multiple combinations for months, researched and paid people to look at the ads and suggest what I can do.<p>Here&#39;s the problem: I only have a small budget I can afford and that is 15€ per day, per platform.</p><p>1. With Facebook, they say they sent more than double the clicks Analytics tells me they sent and the clicks that do pass through have an almost 100% bounce rate with average time spent on page of 0 seconds. For example, they say they sent 300 clicks in a week, but I only see 120-130 in Analytics.</p><p>2. With the same ad, on Reddit Ads, I see in Analytics 90-95% of the clicks they said they sent and the bounce rate is about 82%, with more than 3 minutes average sessions.</p><p>With both platforms I run an ad and then a retargeting ad. Until now, this was the only strategy that had relative success.</p><p>All the people that consulted on the ads said that with 15€ per day, Facebook gives 0 results, which I already saw and I find disappointing. The only explanation I can find is that on Facebook I only get bot clicks.</p><p>Are there any other platforms that are more suitable for my budget?</p></td></div></div>
