      each controller), please implement compatibility with cgroup v2 (i.e.
      the &#34;unified hierarchy&#34;) sooner rather than later. Most of Linux

    * We intend to remove support for split-usr (/usr mounted separately
      during boot) and unmerged-usr (parallel directories /bin and
      /usr/bin, /lib and /usr/lib, etc). This will happen in the second
      half of 2023, in the first release that falls into that time window.

      TPM2 PCR values for a given unified kernel image (UKI) booted via
      sd-stub. The public key used for the signature and the signed
      expected PCR information can be embedded inside the UKI. This
      information can be extracted from the UKI by external tools and code
      in the image itself and is made available to userspace in the booted
      kernel.

      systemd-cryptsetup, systemd-cryptenroll, and systemd-creds have been
      updated to make use of this information if available in the booted
      kernel: when locking an encrypted volume/credential to the TPM
      systemd-cryptenroll/systemd-creds will use the public key to bind the
      volume/credential to any kernel that carries PCR information signed
      by the same key pair. When unlocking such volumes/credentials
      systemd-cryptsetup/systemd-creds will use the signature embedded in
      the booted UKI to gain access.

      Binding TPM-based disk encryption to public keys/signatures of PCR
      values — instead of literal PCR values — addresses the inherent
      &#34;brittleness&#34; of traditional PCR-bound TPM disk encryption schemes:
      disks remain accessible even if the UKI is updated, without any TPM
      specific preparation during the OS update — as long as each UKI
      carries the necessary PCR signature information.

      Net effect: if you boot a properly prepared kernel, TPM-bound disk
      encryption now defaults to be locked to kernels which carry PCR
      signatures from the same key pair. Example: if a hypothetical distro
      FooOS prepares its UKIs like this, TPM-based disk encryption is now –
      by default – bound to only FooOS kernels, and encrypted volumes bound
      to the TPM cannot be unlocked on kernels from other sources. (But do
      note this behaviour requires preparation/enabling in the UKI, and of
      course users can always enroll non-TPM ways to unlock the volume.)

      CPUWeight= settings are applied to the top-level user slice units
      (app.slice, background.slice, session.slice). This provides a degree
      of resource isolation between different user services competing for
      the CPU.

    * Systemd can optionally do a full preset in the &#34;first boot&#34; condition
      (instead of just enable-only). This behaviour is controlled by the
      compile-time option -Dfirst-boot-full-preset. Right now it defaults
      to &#39;false&#39;, but the plan is to switch it to &#39;true&#39; for the subsequent
      release.

    * Drop-ins are now allowed for transient units too.

    * Systemd will set the taint flag &#39;support-ended&#39; if it detects that
      the OS image is past its end-of-support date. This date is declared
      in a new /etc/os-release field SUPPORT_END= described below.

    * Two new settings ConditionCredential= and AssertCredential= can be
      used to skip or fail units if a certain system credential is not
      provided.

    * ConditionMemory= accepts size suffixes (K, M, G, T, …).

    * DefaultSmackProcessLabel= can be used in system.conf and user.conf to
      specify the SMACK security label to use when not specified in a unit
      file.

    * DefaultDeviceTimeoutSec= can be used in system.conf and user.conf to
      specify the default timeout when waiting for device units to
      activate.

    * C.UTF-8 is used as the default locale if nothing else has been
      configured.

    * [Condition|Assert]Firmware= have been extended to support certain
      SMBIOS fields. For example

        ConditionFirmware=smbios-field(board_name = &#34;Custom Board&#34;)

      conditionalizes the unit to run only when
      /sys/class/dmi/id/board_name contains &#34;Custom Board&#34; (without the
      quotes).

    * ConditionFirstBoot= now correctly evaluates as true only during the
      boot phase of the first boot. A unit executed later, after booting
      has completed, will no longer evaluate this condition as true.

    * Socket units will now create sockets in the SELinuxContext= of the
      associated service unit, if any.

    * Boot phase transitions (start initrd → exit initrd → boot complete →
      shutdown) will be measured into TPM2 PCR 11, so that secrets can be
      bound to a specific runtime phase. E.g.: a LUKS encryption key can be
      unsealed only in the initrd.

    * Service credentials (i.e. SetCredential=/LoadCredential=/…) will now
      also be provided to ExecStartPre= processes.

    * Various units are now correctly ordered against
      initrd-switch-root.target where previously a conflict without
      ordering was configured. A stop job for those units would be queued,
      but without the ordering it could be executed only after
      initrd-switch-root.service, leading to units not being restarted in
      the host system as expected.

    * In order to fully support the IPMI watchdog driver, which has not yet
      been ported to the new common watchdog device interface,
      /dev/watchdog0 will be tried first and systemd will silently fallback
      to /dev/watchdog if it is not found.

    * New watchdog-related D-Bus properties are now published by systemd:
      WatchdogDevice, WatchdogLastPingTimestamp,
      WatchdogLastPingTimestampMonotonic.

    * At shutdown, API virtual files systems (proc, sys, etc.) will be
      unmounted lazily.

    * At shutdown, systemd will now log about processes blocking unmounting
      of file systems.

    * A new meson build option &#39;clock-valid-range-usec-max&#39; was added to
      allow disabling system time correction if RTC returns a timestamp far
      in the future.

    * Propagated restart jobs will no longer be discarded while a unit is
      activating.

    * PID 1 will now import system credentials from SMBIOS Type 11 fields
      (&#34;OEM vendor strings&#34;), in addition to qemu_fwcfg. This provides a
      simple, fast and generic path for supplying credentials to a VM,
      without involving external tools such as cloud-init/ignition.

    * The CPUWeight= setting of unit files now accepts a new special value
      &#34;idle&#34;, which configures &#34;idle&#34; level scheduling for the unit.

    * Service processes that are activated due to a .timer or .path unit
      triggering will now receive information about this via environment
      variables. Note that this is information is lossy, as activation
      might be coalesced and only one of the activating triggers will be
      reported. This is hence more suited for debugging or tracing rather
      than for behaviour decisions.

    * The riscv_flush_icache(2) system call has been added to the list of
      system calls allowed by default when SystemCallFilter= is used.

    * The selinux context derived from the target executable, instead of
      &#39;init_t&#39; used for the manager itself, is now used when creating

      Various corner cases in version string comparisons have been fixed

      the main specification.

    * New PCRs measurements are performed during boot: PCR 11 for the the
      kernel+initrd combo, PCR 13 for any sysext images. If a measurement
      took place this is now reported to userspace via the new
      StubPcrKernelImage and StubPcrInitRDSysExts EFI variables.

      &#39;dpkg --compare-versions&#39;).

    * &#39;systemd-analyze dump&#39; is extended to accept glob patterns for unit
      names to limit the output to matching units.

    * tmpfiles.d/ lines can read file contents to write from a credential.
      The new modifier char &#39;^&#39; is used to specify that the argument is a
      credential name. This mechanism is used to automatically populate
      /etc/motd, /etc/issue, and /etc/hosts from credentials.

    * tmpfiles.d/ may now be configured to avoid changing uid/gid/mode of
      an inode if the specification is prefixed with &#39;:&#39; and the inode
      already exists.

    * Default tmpfiles.d/ configuration now carries a line to automatically
      use an &#39;ssh.authorized_keys.root&#39; credential if provided to set up
      the SSH authorized_keys file for the root user.

    * systemd-tmpfiles will now gracefully handle absent source of &#34;C&#34; copy
      lines.

    * tmpfiles.d/ F/w lines now optionally permit encoding of the payload
      in base64. This is useful to write arbitrary binary data into files.

    * The pkgconfig and rpm macros files now export the directory for user
      units as &#39;user_tmpfiles_dir&#39; and &#39;%_user_tmpfilesdir&#39;.

    * Detection of Apple Virtualization and detection of Parallels and
      KubeVirt virtualization on non-x86 archs have been added.

    * os-release gained a new field SUPPORT_END=YYYY-MM-DD to inform the
      user when their system will become unsupported.

    * When performing suspend-then-hibernate, the system will estimate the
      discharge rate and use that to set the delay until hibernation and
      hibernate immediately instead of suspending when running from a
      battery and the capacity is below 5%.

    * systemd-sysctl gained a --strict option to fail when a sysctl
      setting is unknown to the kernel.

    * machinectl supports --force for the &#39;copy-to&#39; and &#39;copy-from&#39;
      verbs.

      will indicate whether a message was logged in the &#39;initrd&#39; phase or
      in the &#39;system&#39; phase of the boot process.

    * Journal files gained a new compatibility flag
      &#39;HEADER_INCOMPATIBLE_COMPACT&#39;. Files with this flag implement changes
      to the storage format that allow reducing size on disk. As with other
      compatibility flags, older journalctl versions will not be able to
      read journal files using this new format. The environment variable
      &#39;SYSTEMD_JOURNAL_COMPACT=0&#39; can be passed to systemd-journald to

    * portablectl gained a --force flag to skip certain sanity checks. This
      is implemented using new flags accepted by systemd-portabled for the
      *WithExtensions() D-Bus methods: SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_ATTACH
      flag now means that the attach/detach checks whether the units are
      already present and running will be skipped. Similarly,
      SD_SYSTEMD_PORTABLE_FORCE_SYSEXT flag means that the check whether
      image name matches the name declared inside of the image will be
      skipped. Callers must be sure to do those checks themselves if
      appropriate.

    * systemd-portabled will now use the original filename to check
      extension-release.NAME for correctness, in case it is passed a
      symlink.

    * systemd-portabled now uses PrivateTmp=yes in the &#39;trusted&#39; profile
      too.

    * sysext&#39;s extension-release files now support &#39;_any&#39; as a special
      value for the ID= field, to allow distribution-independent extensions
      (e.g.: fully statically compiled binaries, scripts). It also gained
      support for a new ARCHITECTURE= field that may be used to explicitly
      restrict an image to hosts of a specific architecture.

    * systemd-repart now supports creating squashfs partitions. This
      requires mksquashfs from squashfs-tools.

    * systemd-repart gained a --split flag to also generate split
      artifacts, i.e. a separate file for each partition. This is useful in
      conjunction with systemd-sysupdate or other tools, or to generate
      split dm-verity artifacts.

    * systemd-repart is now able to generate dm-verity partitions, including
      signatures.

    * systemd-repart can now set a partition UUID to zero, allowing it to
      be filled in later, such as when using verity partitions.

    * systemd-repart now supports drop-ins for its configuration files.

    * Package metadata logged by systemd-coredump in the system journal is
      now more compact.

    * xdg-autostart-service now expands &#39;tilde&#39; characters in Exec lines.

    * systemd-oomd now automatically links against libatomic, if available.

    * systemd-oomd now sends out a &#39;Killed&#39; D-Bus signal when a cgroup is
      killed.

    * scope units now also provide oom-kill status.

    * systemd-pstore will now try to load only the efi_pstore kernel module
      before running, ensuring that pstore can be used.

    * systemd-logind gained a new StopIdleSessionSec= option to stop an idle
      session after a preconfigure timeout.

    * systemd-homed will now wait up to 30 seconds for workers to terminate,
      rather than indefinitely.

    * homectl gained a new &#39;--luks-sector-size=&#39; flag that allows users to
      select the preferred LUKS sector size. Must be a power of 2 between 512
      and 4096. systemd-userdbd records gained a corresponding field.

    * systemd-sysusers will now respect the &#39;SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH&#39; environment
      variable when generating the &#39;sp_lstchg&#39; field, to ensure an image
      build can be reproducible.

    * &#39;udevadm wait&#39; will now listen to kernel uevents too when called with
      --initialized=no.

    * When naming network devices udev will now consult the Devicetree
      &#34;alias&#34; fields for the device.

    * systemd-udev will now create infiniband/by-path and
      infiniband/by-ibdev links for Infiniband verbs devices.

    * systemd-udev-trigger.service will now also prioritize input devices.

    * ConditionACPower= and systemd-ac-power will now assume the system is
      running on AC power if no battery can be found.

    * All features and tools using the TPM2 will now communicate with it
      using a bind key. Beforehand, the tpm2 support used encrypted sessions
      by creating a primary key that was used to encrypt traffic. This
      creates a problem as the key created for encrypting the traffic could
      be faked by an active interposer on the bus. In cases when a pin is
      used, a bind key will be used. The pin is used as the auth value for
      the seal key, aka the disk encryption key, and that auth value will be
      used in the session establishment. An attacker would need the pin
      value to create the secure session and thus an active interposer
      without the pin cannot interpose on TPM2 traffic.

    * systemd-growfs no longer requires udev to run.

    * systemd-backlight now will better support systems with multiple
      graphic cards.

    * systemd-cryptsetup&#39;s keyfile-timeout= option now also works when a
      device is used as a keyfile.

    * systemd-cryptenroll gained a new --unlock-key-file= option to get the
      unlocking key from a key file (instead of prompting the user). Note
      that this is the key for unlocking the volume in order to be able to
      enroll a new key, but it is not the key that is enrolled.

    * systemd-dissect gained a new --umount switch that will safely and
      synchronously unmount all partitions of an image previously mounted
      with &#39;systemd-dissect --mount&#39;.

    * When using gcrypt, all systemd tools and services will now configure
      it to prefer the OS random number generator if present.

      it to prefer the OS random number generator if present.

    * All example code shipped with documentation has been relicensed from CC0
      to MIT-0.

    * Unit tests will no longer fail when running on a system without
      /etc/machine-id.
