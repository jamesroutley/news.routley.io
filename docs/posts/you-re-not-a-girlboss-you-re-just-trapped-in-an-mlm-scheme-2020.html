<p><span>I recently received an </span><i><span>amazing business opportunity</span></i><span>. A stranger named *Amara —  whose Instagram bio reads ‘</span><i><span>own your story</span></i><span>’ — DM’d me to tell me I can earn a high income with low effort, all from my phone. It’s completely free and full training is provided, but I should probably spend $725 on a starter kit as an investment to myself. Wow! </span></p>
<p><span>If you’ve been on social media over the last three months, there’s a good chance you’ve received a similar opportunity. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, just about every woman I know has been asked to join a multi-level marketing scheme. </span></p>
<p><span>If you’re not familiar with MLMs, like Avon, Arbonne, Younique, FM Fragrance, Amway, and Nu Skin, they’re product-based businesses that recruit unsalaried sales staff to recruit </span><i><span>more</span></i><span> unsalaried sales staff. </span><a href="https://centerforinquiry.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/quackwatch/taylor.pdf"><span>A study on MLMs</span></a><span> indicates that the majority of sales staff make a loss, and reps are required to engage in “constant and aggressive recruitment” of new members. </span></p>
<p><span>So why are so many young women joining them? MLMs have a new target audience: the #Girlboss.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>They promote the message that women are failing because they aren’t working hard enough, rather than acknowledge the simple fact that “99% of sellers end up losing money when they invest in multi-level marketing.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span>In the early 2010’s, MLMs’ main clientele were suburban women in their late thirties to early forties.</span><a href="https://www.coursehero.com/file/p4b48jr/4-AVON-SEGMENTATION-AND-TARGET-MARKET-Demographic-segmentation-According-to-an/#:~:text=The%20Target%20Market%20The%20largest,makeup%2C%20perfumes%20and%20skincare%20products."><span> One paper</span></a><span> reported that “[Avon] typically caters to the needs of persons between the ages of 35 to 45 years old with higher education above high school.” MLMs were even parodied in a 2015 episode of Schitt’s Creek when David and Moira join a pyramid scheme, only to learn the craze had swept through the town two years prior. At the same time this show aired, Sophia Amoruso’s #GIRLBOSS had just been published, and a new generation of younger women were becoming empowered by the idea of owning a business, smashing their #goals, and living their best lives on Instagram, all in the name of feminism.</span></p>
<p><span>Recent essays like Leigh Stein’s </span><a href="https://gen.medium.com/the-end-of-the-girlboss-is-nigh-4591dec34ed8"><span>The End of the Girlboss is Here</span></a><span> have shed light on the demise of this mindset, but it’s still thriving within MLMs. </span><span>Grace Wilson, a librarian who runs </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mlm_busters/"><span>@MLM_busters</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-ffX6FnSJK/"><span>recently claimed</span></a><span> that these companies </span><span>“use ‘women supporting women’ to build a captive customer base of ‘empowered’ reps spending money” and explains that they “co-opt feminist language to justify exploitation.” </span></p>
<p><span>Outdated #girlboss messages like the popular ‘You have as many hours in the day as Beyonce’ lend themselves perfectly to MLMs because </span>they promote the message that women are failing because they aren’t working hard enough, rather than acknowledge the simple fact that <a href="https://due.com/blog/3-mind-blowing-statistics-about-mlms/#:~:text=According%20to%20research%20at%20the,money%20in%20an%20MLM%20venture.&amp;text=It&#39;s%20hard%20to%20succeed%20in,earn%20a%20profit%20over%20time.">“99% of sellers end up losing money when they invest in multi-level marketing.</a>”</p>
<p><span>You can see this in action on pro-MLM social media accounts. They post the same unactionable advice we’ve seen since the dawn of Tumblr feminism, like ‘</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CC7LumIn3js/"><span>Girl, get out of your own damn way’</span></a><span> and ‘</span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCIdvmKgfj7/"><span>Hustle beats talent.</span></a><span>’ Delve a bit deeper into these millennial-pink posts and you’ll find problematic boss-shaming messaging like </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCF48nMANsF/"><span>‘If you’re not careful, your own fears and insecurities can trick you into a mediocre life.’ </span></a><span>and </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/s/aGlnaGxpZ2h0OjE3ODk1NzU5MzcwNDA5MzM4?igshid=1nlnsc1iuqe3d&amp;story_media_id=2179983349397600925"><span>‘You spend $10/day on breakfast and lunch. That’s $300/month. You can start a business. You just won’t prioritize’. </span></a></p>
<p><span>While pyramid selling may seem like a clear no-go, it’s easy to understand why some see the appeal. </span><span>The Instagram account</span> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mlmdebunked/"><span>MLM Debunked</span></a><span> states, “</span><span>the pandemic has left a lot of people in positions of financial uncertainty and distress, which makes them primed for an MLM pitch or “opportunity.” They add that “MLMs flourish amongst vulnerable and desperate populations.”</span></p>


  
<p><span>The global financial crisis has </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/14/how-coronavirus-could-do-long-term-damage-to-womens-careers.html"><span>disproportionately impacted women</span></a><span>, especially women of color, and lockdowns have created increased isolation and </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/depression-lockdown-coronavirus-us-americans-clinical-anxiety-a9535826.html"><span>mental health issues</span></a><span>. Both MLMs and Girlboss culture offer a way to fix this: Improve your mindset, join a community of like-minded women, and, above all, get rich. Unfortunately, they also encourage excess spending and an unhealthy work/life balance. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://thefinancialdiet.com/how-the-girlboss-mentality-drove-my-career-ambitions-and-also-destroyed-them/"><span>In her essay</span></a><span> on her personal experience with the #Girlboss mentality, Gina Vaynshteyn detailed how she spent money on non-essentials like manicures to look more “boss” and voluntarily worked 18-hour days to climb the corporate ladder. Similarly, the MLM recruiter I spoke to told me, “The harder you work, the more money you will earn” and listed “showcasing your life and making it look attractive” as a selling tactic.</span></p>
<p><span>Just as joining a pyramid selling scheme is unlikely to bring you financial freedom, working to exhaustion and spending your earnings on non-essentials to appease your Instagram audience is rarely a recipe for happiness </span><i><span>or</span></i><span> personal success. Until we all begin to acknowledge there’s more to life than “the hustle,” and that struggling financially is not a personal failure, MLMs will continue to recruit and exploit aspiring girlbosses under the guise of female empowerment. </span></p>
