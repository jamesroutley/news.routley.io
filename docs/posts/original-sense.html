It is also London&#39;s first bank.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Knights Templar were warrior monks. A religious order, with a theologically inspired hierarchy, mission statement, and code of ethics, but also heavily armed and dedicated to holy war. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>How did they get into the banking game?</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Find-out-more"><span role="text">Find out more</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04b1g3c">50 Things That Made the Modern Economy</a> highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world we live in.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Templars dedicated themselves to the defence of Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem. The city had been captured by the first crusade in 1099 and pilgrims began to stream in, travelling thousands of miles across Europe. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Those pilgrims needed to somehow fund months of food and transport and accommodation, yet avoid carrying huge sums of cash around, because that would have made them a target for robbers. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Alamy</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Pope Honorius II granted official recognition to the Knights Templar in 1128</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Fortunately, the Templars had that covered. A pilgrim could leave his cash at Temple Church in London, and withdraw it in Jerusalem. Instead of carrying money, he would carry a letter of credit. The Knights Templar were the Western Union of the crusades.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>We don&#39;t actually know how the Templars made this system work and protected themselves against fraud. Was there a secret code verifying the document and the traveller&#39;s identity? </p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Financial-fixers"><span role="text">Financial fixers</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Templars were not the first organisation in the world to provide such a service. Several centuries earlier, Tang dynasty China used &#34;feiquan&#34; - flying money - a two-part document allowing merchants to deposit profits in a regional office, and reclaim their cash back in the capital. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But that system was operated by the government. Templars were much closer to a private bank - albeit one owned by the Pope, allied to kings and princes across Europe, and run by a partnership of monks sworn to poverty.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>King Henry III took advantage of the Templars&#39; financial services</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Knights Templar did much more than transferring money across long distances. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As William Goetzmann describes in his book Money Changes Everything, they provided a range of recognisably modern financial services. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>If you wanted to buy a nice island off the west coast of France - as King Henry III of England did in the 1200s with the island of Oleron, north-west of Bordeaux - the Templars could broker the deal. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Henry III paid Â£200 a year for five years to the Temple in London, then when his men took possession of the island, the Templars made sure that the seller got paid. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And in the 1200s, the Crown Jewels were kept at the Temple as security on a loan, the Templars operating as a very high-end pawn broker.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Knights Templar were not Europe&#39;s bank forever, of course. The order lost its reason to exist after European Christians completely lost control of Jerusalem in 1244, and the Templars were eventually disbanded in 1312. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So who would step into the banking vacuum?</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>If you had been at the great fair of Lyon in 1555, you could have seen the answer. Lyon&#39;s fair was the greatest market for international trade in all Europe. </p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Sophisticated-exchange"><span role="text">Sophisticated exchange</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>But at this particular fair, gossip was starting to spread about an Italian merchant who was there, and making a fortune. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He bought and sold nothing: all he had was a desk and an inkstand. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Day after day he sat there, receiving other merchants and signing their pieces of paper, and somehow becoming very rich. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The locals were very suspicious.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But to a new international elite of Europe&#39;s great merchant houses, his activities were perfectly legitimate. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He was buying and selling debt, and in doing so he was creating enormous economic value. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Bills of exchange allowed Florence&#39;s celebrated wool trade to flourish in the Middle Ages</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A merchant from Lyon who wanted to buy - say - Florentine wool could go to this banker and borrow something called a bill of exchange. This was a credit note, an IOU, but it was not denominated in the French livre or Florentine lira. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Its value was expressed in the ecu de marc, a private currency used by this international network of bankers. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And if the Lyonnaise merchant or his agents travelled to Florence, the bill of exchange from the banker in Lyon would be recognised by bankers in Florence, who would gladly exchange it for local currency.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Through this network of bankers, a local merchant could not only exchange currencies but also translate his creditworthiness in Lyon into creditworthiness in Florence, a city where nobody had ever heard of him - a valuable service, worth paying for. </p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="More-from-Tim-Harford"><span role="text">More from Tim Harford</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Every few months, agents of this network of bankers would meet at the great fairs such as Lyon&#39;s, go through their books, net off all the credit notes against each other and settle any remaining debts.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Our financial system today has a lot in common with this model. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>An Australian with a credit card can walk into a supermarket in Lyon and walk out with groceries. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The supermarket checks with a French bank, which talks to an Australian bank, which approves the payment, happy that this woman is good for the money. </p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Checks-and-balances"><span role="text">Checks and balances</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>But this web of banking services has always had a darker side to it. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>By turning personal obligations into internationally tradable debts, these medieval bankers were creating their own private money, outside the control of Europe&#39;s kings. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Rich, and powerful, they had no need for the coins minted by the sovereign.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The 2008 collapse of the Lehman Brothers bank led to financial instability across the globe</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>That description rings true even today. International banks are locked together in a web of mutual obligations that defies easy understanding or simple control.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They can use their international reach to try to sidestep taxes and regulations. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And, since their debts to each other are a very real kind of private money, when the banks are fragile, the entire monetary system of the world also becomes vulnerable.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>We are still trying to figure out what to do with these banks. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>We cannot live without them, it seems, and yet we are not sure we want to live with them. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Governments have long sought ways to hold them in check. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Sometimes the approach has been laissez-faire, sometimes not. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Few regulators have been quite as ardent as King Philip IV of France. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Alamy</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The last grandmaster of the Templars, Jacques de Molay, was burned to death in Paris in 1314</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He owed money to the Templars, and they refused to forgive his debts. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So in 1307, on the site of what is now the Temple stop on the Paris Metro, Philip launched a raid on the Paris Temple - the first of a series of attacks across Europe. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Templars were tortured and forced to confess any sin the Inquisition could imagine. The order was disbanded by the Pope. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The London Temple was rented out to lawyers. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And the last grandmaster of the Templars, Jacques de Molay, was brought to the centre of Paris and publicly burned to death. </p></div><section data-component="around-the-bbc"><p><h2>Around the BBC</h2></p><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li><li></li></ul></section></article></div></div>
