                <p>
                    MiniZinc is a <a href="https://www.minizinc.org/license.html">free and open-source</a> <b>constraint modeling language</b>.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use MiniZinc to model constraint satisfaction and optimization problems in a <b>high-level</b>,
                    <b>solver-independent</b> way, taking advantage of a large
                    <a href="https://www.minizinc.org/doc-latest/en/lib.html">library of pre-defined constraints</a>.
                    Your model is then compiled into FlatZinc, a solver input language that is understood by
                    <a href="https://www.minizinc.org/software.html#flatzinc">a wide range of solvers</a>.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    MiniZinc is developed at <a href="http://www.monash.edu">Monash University</a> with support from <a href="https://optima.org.au/">OPTIMA</a>.
