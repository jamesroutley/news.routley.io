An upgrade from OpenWrt 23.05 to OpenWrt 24.10 is supported in many cases with 
the help of the sysupgrade utility which will also attempt to preserve the 
configuration. A configuration backup is advised nonetheless when upgrading to 
OpenWrt 24.10. (see “Upgrading” below).

<h2 id="upgrading_to_2410">Upgrading to 24.10</h2>
<div>

<p>
Sysupgrade can be used to upgrade a device from 23.05 to 24.10, and configuration will be preserved in most cases.
For for upgrades inside the OpenWrt 24.10 stable series for example from a OpenWrt 24.10 release candidate <a href="https://blog.plover.com/docs/guide-user/installation/attended.sysupgrade" title="docs:guide-user:installation:attended.sysupgrade" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:installation:attended.sysupgrade">Attended Sysupgrade</a> is supported in addition which allows preserving the installed packages too.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://blog.plover.com/lib/images/smileys/exclaim.svg" alt=":!:"/> Sysupgrade from 22.03 to 24.10 is not officially supported.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://blog.plover.com/lib/images/smileys/exclaim.svg" alt=":!:"/> There is no configuration migration path for users of the ipq806x target for Qualcomm Atheros IPQ806X SoCs because it switched to <a href="https://blog.plover.com/docs/guide-user/network/dsa/start" title="docs:guide-user:network:dsa:start" data-wiki-id="docs:guide-user:network:dsa:start">DSA</a>. You have to upgrade without saving the configuration.
<code>Image version mismatch. image 1.1 device 1.0 Please wipe config during upgrade (force required) or reinstall. Config cannot be migrated from swconfig to DSA Image check failed</code>
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://blog.plover.com/lib/images/smileys/exclaim.svg" alt=":!:"/> User of the Linksys E8450 aka. Belkin RT3200 running OpenWrt 23.05 or earlier will need to run installer version <a href="https://github.com/dangowrt/owrt-ubi-installer/releases/tag/v1.1.3" title="https://github.com/dangowrt/owrt-ubi-installer/releases/tag/v1.1.3" rel="ugc nofollow">v1.1.3</a> or later in order to reorganize the UBI layout for the 24.10 release. <a href="https://blog.plover.com/toh/linksys/e8450#upgrading_an_ubi_installation_to_new_releases_after_2024-02_includes_all_snapshots_2410-snapshots_24100-rcx_releases_and_all_releases_in_the_foreseable_future" title="toh:linksys:e8450" data-wiki-id="toh:linksys:e8450">A detailed description is in the OpenWrt wiki.</a> Updating without using the installer will break the device. Sysupgrade will show a warning before doing an incompatible upgrade.
</p>

<p>
<img src="https://blog.plover.com/lib/images/smileys/exclaim.svg" alt=":!:"/> Users of the Xiaomi AX3200 aka. Redmi AX6S running OpenWrt 23.05 or earlier have to follow a <a href="https://blog.plover.com/toh/xiaomi/ax3200#upgrading_from_2305_and_earlier_to_upcoming_2410_or_snapshot" title="toh:xiaomi:ax3200" data-wiki-id="toh:xiaomi:ax3200">special upgrade procedure described in the wiki</a>. This will increase the flash memory available for OpenWrt. Updating without following the guide in the wiki break the device. Sysupgrade will show a warning before doing an incompatible upgrade.

<h3 id="known_issues">Known issues</h3>
<div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>LEDs for Airoha AN8855 are not yet supported.</strong> Devices like the Xiaomi AX3000T with an Airoha switch will have their switch LEDs powered off. This issue will be addressed in an upcoming OpenWrt SNAPSHOT and the OpenWrt 24.10 minor release.  </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>5GHz WiFi is non-functional on certain devices with ath10k chipsets.</strong> Affected models include the TP-Link Archer C60 v1, TP-Link Archer C6 v2, and possibly others.

</li>
<li><p><strong>Ethernet link instability on some MT7530 switches.</strong> Users experiencing unstable Ethernet connections should disable Energy-Efficient Ethernet (EEE) as a workaround. See <a href="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/issues/17351" title="https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/issues/17351" rel="ugc nofollow">issue #17351</a> for more information.  </p>
