        <p dir="auto">Over the years, I have received many proposals to monetize this extension so I think I&#39;ll just start posting them here for fun (but not for profit). The main reason I continue to maintain this extension is because I can hardly trust others to not fall for one of these offers. I&#39;m fortunate to have a job that pays well enough to allow me to keep my moral compass and ignore all of these propositions. I realize that not everyone has the same financial security so hopefully this thread would shed some light on what kind of pressure is put on extension developers.</p>

<p dir="auto">Hope this message finds you well.</p>
<p dir="auto">My name is <em>redacted</em> and I’m a Strategic Partnerships Manager at <em>redacted</em> - monetization platform for browser extensions.</p>
<p dir="auto">I am contacting you since I came across the extension &#39;Hover Zoom+&#39; at Chrome Store; I consider your product can help you bring profit by means of collaborating together.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would like to suggest a potential partnership between our companies that will significantly increase your revenues.</p>
<p dir="auto">Are you interested in discussing our offer in more details?</p>
<p dir="auto">Hope for positive feedback and ongoing cooperation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Please forgive my persistence, I’m following up to an email I sent to you last week in regards to your Chrome browser extension.  I am still interested in speaking with you about monetizing your anonymous user data.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are a couple things I want to insure you know.</p>
<p dir="auto">Monetizing anonymous user data is happening on almost every website we visit - you may be leaving alot of money on the table by not monetizing your anonymous user data.  Try dowloading Ghostry to see for yourself.</p>
<p dir="auto">Again, if your data is strong, it has the potential to produce a significant new revenue stream for you and your business.  Here is a link to our self-serve Developer Dashboard: <em>redacted</em></p>
<p dir="auto">I’d be happy to provide additional information should you have any questions.</p>

<p dir="auto">My name is <em>redacted</em>, I’m a co-founder and CEO of <em>redacted</em> – a Market intelligence service for ecommerce. (like similarweb, only for ecommerce).</p>
<p dir="auto">We are revolutionizing the way ecommerce data is being generated and consumed</p>
<p dir="auto">We are building a user panel of several of millions of users worldwide and are looking for top quality partners with substantial user base to enhance our panel.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are working in a very similar manner to <em>redacted</em>, providing you with an easy to integrate SDK to collect anonymous data.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you are already working with <em>redacted</em>’s SDK the integration should take no more than a couple of minutes.</p>
<p dir="auto">It is also important to state that we collect no personal data and only store information relevant for online shopping trends.</p>
<p dir="auto">We can help you monetize your extension in a simple and non-intrusive manner.</p>
<p dir="auto">I would like to discuss potential integration with you and see how we can work together.</p>
<p dir="auto">Will you be available today/tomorrow for a short call to explain things?</p>

<p dir="auto">I’m sure you get business proposals all the time, so I’ll get straight to the point. I hope what I’m proposing is a little different and might actually interest you. I like Hover Zoom+ as a great alternative to it’s bigger brother Hover Zoom that lost its glamour over the last couple of months.</p>
<p dir="auto">We&#39;re conducting a DNS error research and we’re interested in small amounts of anonymous data that you might be able to provide via your Chrome extension. Our research has been going on for years and Google has never had the slightest problem with it.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Compatible with Google’s strict policies</li>
<li>No personal user data</li>
<li>No ads, no malware</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The data we’re interested in are basically just DNS errors:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>NXD – Non Existent Domain - the domain that a user entered that resulted in a DNS error.</li>
<li>A time stamp – when it happened.</li>
<li>GEO – where it happened (USA, UK, RU etc.).</li>
<li>A unique randomly generated user ID (can be hashed, not traceable back to the user). Please, don’t confuse this with the user IP address.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">And that’s all. You can either use our script or collect the data on your own and send it to us via an FTP server, API etc. There’s a lot of different ways we can do this. We pay on a monthly basis. The payments depend on user GEOs, but it would be in thousands of dollars per year.</p>
<p dir="auto">Is this worth at least a brief discussion? Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">A while back I reached out to you regarding a DNS error research our company conducts. Hover Zoom+ would be an ideal medium for our research. In return, this could become a solid new revenue stream for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our method has been going on for years and we’ve never had the slightest problem with Google. We pay regularly on a monthly basis. For you it would be in tens of thousands of dollars per year - the amount depends on your users base and data quality.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you’re concerned about including third party scripts, there’s still a lot of ways we can make this work.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please let me know if this is worth a brief discussion to you.</p>

<p dir="auto">Hello! My name is <em>redacted</em> and I work with users traffic monetization, as well as browser extensions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I&#39;m <em>redacted</em>, regional manager of <em>redacted</em> advertisement network.</p>
<p dir="auto"><em>redacted</em> is PopUnder ad network operating since 2015.  We are currently offering your extension/plugin a private deal with advanced payments for CPM / impressions, and we are ready to discuss the prices so that our offer could be more profitable for you.</p>
<p dir="auto">PopUnder is different from PopUp and other types of online ads. PopUnder opens in a new tab/window in one click. The ad appears as a separate tab or window behind the main browser window (that is why it’s called PopUnder) and doesn’t have a negative impact on the user’s perception of the website and user experience. PopUnder doesn’t distract the user from your website. All technical settings (number of clicks, time etc) are open to discussion.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just to see how PopUnder operates you can try our demo: <em>redacted</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Advertisements correspond with your target audience so that you monetize your site to the fullest extent. You will decide how often PopUnder ads  will appear. The ads can be moderated and you can disable or remove any kind of advertisement you dislike.</p>
<p dir="auto">Our ads are currently running on: <em>redacted</em></p>
<p dir="auto">Our platform comprises 3000+ advertisers.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main ad categories are e-commerce (online shopping), software, gaming.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please download our presentation: <em>redacted</em></p>
<p dir="auto">I am always ready to answer any questions and receive other feedback on our cooperation via email <em>redacted</em> or Skype –<em>redacted</em>.</p>

Our partners have gained access to a new and simple revenue stream without interfering with your user experience or gathering PII. We consider partners and their users to be long term strategic relationships.  In some instances, we&#39;ve also acquired extensions where it made sense for both sides.</p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">I am contacting you regarding your browser extension (I love the simplicity of it :) ). I think there is an opportunity for a cooperation between us.</p>
<p dir="auto">I’ve developed <em>redacted</em> – an extension that lets users support highly effective, research-backed charities while shopping online (with no extra costs). It’s somewhat similar to Amazon Smile program. It works with 1000+ shops including eBay, Microsoft, Etsy, Barnes&amp;Noble, Aliexpress. For every $4.85 raised for Against Malaria Foundation two people are protected from malaria (via bed nets) and for every $1.19 raised for Schistosomiasis Control Initiative one child gets a year supply of medicine.</p>
<p dir="auto">Would you be interested in placing a recommendation for <em>redacted</em> after user installs your extension? I could pay $1 per new user that comes from your page.</p>
<p dir="auto">That way you can unintrusively monetize your software and help raise money for great causes at the same time.</p>

<p dir="auto">Short story.</p>
