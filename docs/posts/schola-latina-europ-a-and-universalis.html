		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Whereas any student can understand that we accurately know the writing usages of the Romans, as well as those of the users of Latin of any other later periods, it is a cause of greater confusion and even scepticism to affirm that we also know with great accuracy the pronunciation of Latin in the different stages of its long history, and in particular in classical times.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">It would be too long to explain here how we have come to know the pronunciation of Latin in times for which we have no sound record; but this is a question on which many specialists have worked, and the beginner has to exercise a certain degree of trust in the teacher. We will mention here nevertheless the main instruments that allow us to know how a language like Latin was pronounced in the past.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">1. In the first place weíve got historical and comparative philology. If a Latin word like <i>m·ter</i>, for instance, has evolved into Italian and Spanish <i>madre</i>, Catalan <i>mare</i>, French <i>mËre</i>, Portuguese <i>m„e</i> and in all of those languages without exception the letter <i>m</i> is pronounced the same way, maybe we can hesitate about the pronunciation of the other letters in the word; but we have in principle no reason to think that the <i>m</i> was pronounced any differently in Latin than it is pronounced in all those languages that derive from it. If we then compare Latin not with the daughter languages that evolved from it in later times, but with the sister languages that are related to it because they share an even older common origin, the so called Indo-European languages, and we observe that the letter <i>m</i> has kept exactly the same pronunciation, independently from Latin, into modern Greek ŒºŒ∑œÑŒµœÅŒ± [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">mi.&#39;t…õ.ra</SPAN>], German <i>Mutter</i> [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">&#39;m ä.t ∞…ê</SPAN>] and Hindi  ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡§æ  [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">&#39;m…ë:.t…ë:</SPAN>], which all correspond to Latin <i>m·ter</i>, then once more we find support to be pretty sure of the way Latin <i>m</i> was pronounced. Similar analogies can be established for all the other letters. Historical and comparative philology can also explain the cases where we observe differences in the related languages, as the presence of an <i>Ë</i> in French or a <i>u</i> in German where we have <i>·</i> in Latin, and we can thus have an idea of the way in which Latin was and was not pronounced.</SPAN></p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">2. We have also the written testimony of Latin grammarians, who described how the sounds were articulated, or Latin writers in general who commented on many points of pronunciation.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">3. Spelling mistakes we find on inscriptions also illuminate us regarding contemporary pronunciation. If during a certain century everybody writes <i>Êquus</i> when they mean ëjustí, and <i>equus</i> when they mean ëhorseí, and we donít find, even in the writing of the less educated, anyone that confuses the two words, but in the following century many people, even the better educated, start to hesitate and sometimes write <i>equus</i> to mean ëjustí and <i>Êquus</i> for ëhorseí, we can gather two things: first, that in the latter century the pronunciation of <i>Ê</i> and <i>e</i> was similar enough to make even educated people make mistakes when they wrote those otherwise unrelated words; and second, that in the former century, on the other hand, the pronunciation of <i>Ê</i> and <i>e</i> was still so different that not even uneducated people confused the two words when writing.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">4. Finally, poetry gives us a lot of clues about pronunciation, as a poem has to abide by certain rules of sonority that tell us how the words in it should be pronounced to create the adequate rhythm.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">With all of these tools and the number of documents that have arrived to us from antiquity, we can be sure that we know quite accurately óthere are always some minor obscure areas, of courseó how Latin was pronounced during the classical period. The interested student should refer to W. Sidney Allen, <i>Vox Latina, The Pronunciation of Classical Latin</i>, Cambridge University Press 1992 [1965], where a much more detailed treatment of all these topics will be found.</SPAN></p>
		</SPAN><p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3"><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">But before we proceed with the classical pronunciation of Latin, we need to try and clarify the tremendous confusion that reigns regarding the so called &#39;ecclesiastical&#39; pronunciation. As it was only natural, after the fall of the Roman empire, Latin, which survived as a learned language, came to be pronounced in every country according to the conventions of the respective vernacular; thus the Latin word <i>lÊtitia</i> [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">la…õÃØ.&#39;t…™.t…™. ≤a</SPAN>] received in Italy the pronunciation [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">le.&#39;ti.tsja</SPAN>] like the Italian name <i>Letizia</i>, in Spain [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">le.&#39;ti.Œ∏ja</SPAN>] like the name <i>Leticia</i>, in England [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">l…ô.&#39;t ∞…™ É.…ô</SPAN>], etc. (cf. <i>Op. cit.</i>, &#34;Appendix B: The pronunciation of Latin in England&#34;, pp. 102-110). These traditional pronunciations, varying from one nation to another, were in use in each country in all areas of Latin, both in scholarly contexts and in ecclesiastical ones, of course indistinctively as there was never a conscience that there should be any division between the two. It is wrong to think therefore, as not a few people in modern times have mistakenly been led to believe, that there existed in history a specifically ecclesiastical pronunciation of Latin or that the Italian proununciation would ever have been used by non Italians. Against these varying traditional pronunciations, itís true, there had been throughout history different erudite initiatives to promote a unified pronunciation of Latin; yet these were not based on the Italian vernacular, but rather on the testimony of the ancient sources, usually understood to support the principle of &#34;one letter one sound&#34; independently of the spelling context, as seemed to be suggested by phonetic descriptions of the letters of the alphabet like the one provided for instance by Martianus Capella in his <i>DÈ nuptiÌs</i>. These erudite unifying tendencies, of course, affected the Latin used both inside and outside the church indistinctly, as for centuries scholars and ecclesiastics were the same people. As a matter of fact, this type of pronunciation was still in use in the court of pope Leo XIII, as anyone who listens to the 1902 recordings of the Italian castrato Professor Alessandro Moreschi can easily perceive (he says [</SPAN><SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">pon.&#39;ti.fi.kem</SPAN>], [</SPAN><SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">&#39;e.ti.am</SPAN>], etc.). Yet these erudite attempts failed for centuries to displace the various national pronunciations that traditionally prevailed in the different countries, both inside and outside the church.</p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">As erudition became increasingly sophisticated, the simple principle of &#34;one letter one sound&#34; was refined by further inspection of the ancient sources, notably by Erasmus and his successors, and the tendency to bring the pronunciation of Latin ever more closely to the one it had in classical times became the main aim of the better educated, who were also ever more disconnected from ecclesiastical milieus. After the fascinating advancement that the science of philology experienced in the last hundred years óscientific comparative philology didnít really start before the 19th century, with the development of interest in Sanskrit that came along with the European colonization of Indiaó, it was finally possible to recover the classical pronunciation of Latin to remarkable detail. The brilliance of this intellectual achievement of philological science made that in a very short time the unified erudite pronunciation of Latin finally displaced the diverse vernacular traditional pronunciations from all areas of scholarship all over the world (except, partially, in Italy); but as erudition and church now went along completely diverging ways, the different traditional pronunciations prevailed in the ecclesiastical context. This century saw therefore for the first time in history a division between the pronunciation of Latin inside and outside the church, and the birth of the label of &#39;ecclesiastical&#39; for what was nothing other than the traditional vernacular pronunciations of Latin. As had traditionally been the case, these vernacular pronunciations were still different in the different countries, and in response to the successful internationalisation of the erudite pronunciation, the ecclesiastical authorities started a battle to unify ecclesiastical Latin too; but instead of doing so through the finally thriving unified pronunciation of the erudites, which was in origin no less ecclesiastical than the vernacular ones, they decided to try and spread the traditional pronunciation of one country, Italy, to the rest of the world. Pope Pius X expressed this wish in a letter to the archbishop of Bourges in 1912 (cf. <i>Op. cit.</i>, p. 108) and the anhistorical identification of ecclesiastical Latin with the vernacular pronunciation of modern Italian has been spreading since then. Yet even in the 1980s the last Spanish priests I heard using Latin were still firmly sticking to the Spanish pronunciation, and I know well that the vernacular German pronunciation of Latin is still the norm in that country. In any case, the demise of the use of Latin in the church seems to be making both the traditional local pronunciations in general, and the Italian one in particular, equally irrelevant.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Leaving therefore the ecclesiastical Babel behind, we will now proceed to describe the classical pronunciation of Latin ówhich is sometimes given the name of <i>prÛn˙nti·tiÛ restit˙ta</i>ó, as the only authentic standard across borders, and indeed the only thriving one. As said before, the philologist has books available in which they can find lengthier explanations; but the majority of students should have enough with the following. For comparative purposes, British English so-called Received Pronunciation (RP) has been chosen as the standard.</SPAN></p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">
		
		<p><b><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Vowels</SPAN></b></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Latin has <b>six </b>vowel<b> letters</b>, the last one of which only appears in words of Greek origin:</SPAN></p>

		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">a e i o u y</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Latin has <b>twelve </b>main vowel<b> sounds</b>, since each one of the vowel letters can represent either of two sounds, one we call <b>short</b> and another we call <b>long</b>. The long sound can be indicated in writing by means of the <a href="http://avitus.alcuinus.net/schola_latina/litterae_en.php" target="content2"><b>apex</b></a>, although, unfortunately, in the majority of texts this extremely beneficial mark is not used (in others it is substituted by the metrical macron, with the subsequent confusion between vocalic quantity and syllabic quantity):</SPAN></p>

			</tr>
		</tbody></table>
</center>

		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Generally speaking we can say that the long sound is achieved by slightly lengthening in pronunciation the short sound; although this lengthening comes hand in hand with a greater effort of the articulatory organs, which slightly modifies not only the <b>duration</b> (quantity), but also the <b>timbre</b> (quality) of the sound of the vowel.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">English has very accurate equivalents for the Latin short vowels e (as English <i>bed</i>), i (<i>bit</i>), o (British RP pronunciation of <i>pot</i>) and u (<i>put</i>), and for the Latin long vowels · (British RP pronounciation of <i>father</i>, similar to General American pronunciation of <i>odd</i>), Ì (<i>machine</i>), ˙ (<i>goose</i>). Not so much for the rest of vowels: Latin short a is somewhat between the vowels in British RP <i>cut</i> and <i>cat</i>, Latin long Û is similar to British RP pronounciation of <i>thought</i> and even closer to certain less common American pronunciations of <i>force</i>, and Latin long È is unlike anything an English speaker is accustomed to articulate. The sound of vowels y and ˝, originally Greek, is also foreign to English; they sound like French u, that is by rounding the lips as for the oo in <i>goose</i>, but saying an ee as in <i>geese</i>.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">The main difficulty native English speakers are likely to experience with Latin vowels derives from the fact that long vowels in English usually appear only in accented syllables, so it will prove challenging to put them in non accented ones, where they appear in Latin just as frequently as they do in accented ones; in fact, in non accented syllables, all vowels have a tendency in English to become a mere schwa [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">…ô</SPAN>], which is a neuter vowel (the first a in <i>about</i>) that sounds like something in between Latin a, e, i, o, u and y, while at the same time being none of them in particular. This diminished pronunciation of the vowels hinders comprehensibility enormously and must be avoided at all costs in Latin.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">A secondary problem is that some of the Latin vowel sounds (e and o) never appear in an open syllable in English, so there will be a tendency to change them into diphthongs in words like &#39;mare&#39;, whose final e will tend to be pronounced as in English <i>cafÈ</i>, or &#39;homÛ&#39;, which will be made to rhyme with English <i>homo</i>. This should also be carefully avoided.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">We now indicate the pronunciation of each vowel by means of the symbols of the <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/ling/resources/ipa/charts/IPAlab/IPAlab.htm" target="_blank">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>, and we provide some examples that can be listened to by clicking on each one of them:</SPAN></p>

		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Latin has <b>six diphthongs</b>, that is pairings of vowels belonging to the same syllable. Only the first three diphthongs are really frequent, whereas the second three appear only in a very small number of words. These combinations of vowels can also appear as hiatus, i.e. belong to separate syllables. In the case of the first three pairings, the hiatus will happen mainly in words of foreign origin. No ideal and consistent way to distinguish diphthongs from hiatuses in spelling has yet been devised. The one I follow is described below. It is ambiguous only in the case of <i>eu</i>. Most people and modern editors of Latin texts donít even attempt to distinguish diphthongs from hiatuses in writing at all, and one is meant to know in advance which case is which. </SPAN></p>

		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">To put it in a different way, diphthongs are vocalic clusters that, within one and the same syllable, start with one vowel sound and end with another. Looking at the Latin spelling, it should be absolutely straightforward how they are going to sound (although this will look much less straightforward for native speakers of English, whose vocalic system is very different from others): Ê starts with a and ends with e (similar to English <i>I</i>), ú starts with o and ends with e (similar to <i>boy</i>), au starts with a and ends with u (just as in <i>cow</i>), eu starts with e and ends with u (similar to a very posh British <i>post</i>), ej starts with e and ends with i (just as in <i>hey</i>), uj starts with u and ends with i (without equivalent in English).</SPAN></p>

		

		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3"><b>Consonants</b></SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Latin has <b>nineteen </b>consonantal<b> letters</b>, the last one of which only appears in words of Greek origin:</SPAN></p>

		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">As has been said above, the letters <i>j</i> and <i>v</i> are only graphic variants of <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>, and the ancients didnít allocate any precise distinguishing value to the difference; nevertheless the pronunciation of the consonants differs from that of the vowels and we consider the written distinction later established to be advantageous in order to mark this difference, and therefore to be worth observing. Of course, it makes no sense to observe it in one case and not in the other.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">The letters <i>c</i>, <i>k</i> and <i>q</i> represent exactly the same sound. The letter <i>k</i> is just an archaism, which only appears in a few words before <i>a</i> (e.gr. <i>kalendÊ</i>) and <i>q</i> is only used before a semivocalic <i>u</i> followed by a vowel (e.gr. <i>qvis</i>).</SPAN></p>

The puff of air is weaker in English after an initial s- (so called liquid s, as in <i>spot</i>, <i>stop</i>, <i>scar</i>), and itís this type of unaspirated sound that should be aimed at instead.

There are useful tongue-training exercises for native speakers of English to pronounce a correct Latin r. One of the most useful ones is to say <i>train</i> without the vowels (i.e. <i>trn</i>) repeatedly, whereby the articulation of the r can be brought forward in the mouth to that of the t and the n that contain it.

<div><p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3"><b>Syllables</b></SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">In order to know where to put the accent or stress in a Latin word, and also to understand the structure of Latin verse, we first need to know how to divide a Latin word into syllables.</SPAN></p>
		
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">1. Vowels</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">1a. Every syllable has a vowel as its nucleus (no consonant can form a syllable on its own without a vowel).</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">1b. There will normally be as many syllables in a word as there are vowels, one vowel per syllable. So vowels that appear together regularly belong to different syllables:</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">me-us, su-us, a-vi-a, √≥-ti-um</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">1c. <b>Exception:</b> the groups seen above (√¶, ≈ì, au, and less frequently eu, ei, ui) are usually not divided, but pronounced within the same syllable, and we call them diphthongs; on rare occasions (usually foreign words, but not always) those groups of vowels do belong to different syllables, a phenomenon we call hiatus. Cases of hiatus have to be learnt specifically.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Diphthong √¶: √¶-ri-us</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">1d. <b>Note:</b> It is a very common tendency to hear things like a disyllabic pronunciation of &#39;tertia&#39; [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">&#39;t…õr.tja</SPAN>]. This is wrong and should be carefully avoided. The combination &#39;ia&#39; is no diphthong, so the i and the a belong to different syllables and the word is trisyllabic and should be read &#39;ter-ti-a&#39;. In fact, in combinations of i+vowel, a glide in the form of a [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">j</SPAN>] (as in Eng. &#39;y&#39;) happens between the two to produce [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">&#39;t…õr.t…™. ≤a</SPAN>].The same goes for u+vowel, where a [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">w</SPAN>] sound appears; thus &#39;quattuor&#39; sounds [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">&#39;kwat.t ä. ∑…î…æ</SPAN>] (not disyllabic [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">&#39;kwat.tw…î…æ</SPAN>]).</SPAN></p>
		
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">2. Consonants</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">2a. A consonant between two vowels forms a syllable with the following vowel, not with the preceding one as it often does in English. The simplest syllabic structure of Latin words therefore is v-cv-cv-cv‚Ä¶, or, of course (cf. point 1 above), cv-cv-‚Ä¶-cv-cvc:</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">a-ni-ma, √©-la-b√≥-r√≥</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">2b. Any group of consonants between two vowels is separated: the last consonant of the group will form a syllable with the following vowel and the rest will belong with the preceding syllable: cvc-cv‚Ä¶, cvcc-cv‚Ä¶, etc.:</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">gut-ta, gut-tur, cel-la, com-m√∫-ni-t√°s</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">2c. <b>Exception 1:</b> the combinations ch, ph, th, qu (qv [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">kw</SPAN>]), and in some cases gu (gv [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">gw</SPAN>]) and su (sv [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">sw</SPAN>]) before vowels, represent single phonemes and cannot be divided; on the other hand, the letter x represents two phonemes [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">ks</SPAN>] that can belong to different syllables:</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">pul-cher, sym-ph√≥-ni-a, syn-the-sis, e-qvus</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">2d. <b>Exception 2:</b> a consonantal cluster of <i>m√∫ta cum liquid√°</i> (a stop with a liquid) cannot be divided. M√∫t√¶ are b/p/ph, d/t/th, g/c/ch, but we also consider f for this rule; liquid√¶ are l and r:</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">com-pr√≥-mis-sum, c√≥ns-truc-ti-√≥, √≠ns-cr√≠p-ti-√≥</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">All syllables in Latin, whether accented or not, should be allocated a fairly regular amount of energy and should be pronounced equally clearly, much unlike other languages like English or Portuguese where most unaccented syllables are hardly dwelled on.</SPAN></p>
		
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">3. Syllabic quantity</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">It is very important to distinguish between vocalic quantity (short and long vowels) and syllabic quantity (short and long syllables). A syllable is said to be short if it has in it:</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">a) a short vowel followed by no consonant within the same syllable: <u>a</u>-n<u>i</u>-m<u>a</u>, c<u>a</u>-v<u>e</u>-<u>a</u></SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">A syllable is said to be long if it has in it:</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">a) a long vowel: d<u>√∫</u>-c<u>√≥</u>, R<u>√≥</u>-m<u>√°</u>-n<u>√≠</u></SPAN></p>
		
		<p><b><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Accent</SPAN></b></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Now that we know how to identify Latin syllables and their quantity, we can easily work out the position of the accent or stress in a Latin word. We just need to pay attention to the penultimate syllable of that word, and follow this rule:</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">If the penultimate syllable is long, the accent falls on it:</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">m√°-<b>tr√≥</b>-na (a housewife), ac-<b>cen</b>-tus</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">If the penultimate syllable is short, the accent goes back one syllable and falls on the antepenultimate (if the word has more than two syllables of course):</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3"><b>M√°</b>-tro-na (the river Marne), fa-<b>mi</b>-li-a</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">It‚Äôs worth noting in this respect that a vowel before another vowel will regularly be short (e.gr. the <i>i</i> in <b>per</b>-v<u>i</u>-us); although there are some exceptions, mainly in foreign words (e.gr. the <i>√©</i> in M√∫-<b>s<u>√©</u></b>-um).</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Only a few words have exceptionally an accent on the ultima for historical reasons, like il-<b>l√≠c</b> or Ar-p√≠-<b>n√°s</b>. These will have to be learnt independently.</SPAN></p>
		
		<p><b><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Synal≈ìpha</SPAN></b></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">The last thing we need to know about Latin pronunciation is a phenomenon we call <i>synal≈ìpha</i> which takes place when words are put together in connected speech. When a word that ends with a vowel (including a nasalised vowel, i.e. one followed by <i>m cad√∫ca</i>), or with a diphthong, comes before another word that starts with a vowel or diphthong (including aspirated ones, i.e. those preceded by <i>h</i>), the last syllable of the preceding word and the first one of the following word coalesce, combining into one joint syllable, where the last vowel of the preceding word becomes just a semivocalic sound or glide:</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">s√≠ m<b>√© o</b>bsecret [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">si</SPAN>:<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">.&#39;meÃØ…îp.s…õ.k…æ…õt</SPAN>]</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">c<b>um a</b>rcessor [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">k äÃÉÃØar.&#39;k…õs.s…î…æ</SPAN>]</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">siquid<b>em he</b>rcle poss√≠s [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">s…™.&#39;kw…™.&#39;d…õÃÉÃØ…õÃ•r.k…´…õ.&#39;p…îs.si</SPAN>:<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">s</SPAN>]</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Some vernaculars like English, and even more so German, have a little glottal stop before words that start with a vowel, which prevents synal≈ìpha (the fusion of the involved vowels into a single syllable) producing hiatus instead (a pronunciation of the vowels in distinctly separate syllables). This breaks the flow of the language and makes Latin sound very unnatural. It must be avoided.</SPAN></p>
		<p><SPAN face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="3">Despite widespread confusion, it must be noticed that synal≈ìpha is neither elision nor diphthong. Elision would mean the complete disappearance from pronunciation of the final vowel of the preceding word, as if we were to pronounce <i>s√≠ m√© obsecret</i> as [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">si</SPAN>:<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">.&#39;m…îp.s…õ.k…æ…õt</SPAN>]. Elision happens in many vernaculars (cf. Italian <i>l‚Äôuniversit√†</i>, Catalan <i>m‚Äôagrada</i>, French <i>j‚Äôaccuse</i>), but Roman writers clearly indicate that this is not the case in Latin. Diphthong too is different from synal≈ìpha, in that in the diphthong the vowel that acts as a semivowel is the second one, whereas in the synal≈ìpha it‚Äôs the first one. This has important implications in poetry, because a dipthong makes its syllable always long (the semivowel closes the syllable and makes it long by position), whereas the result of a synal≈ìpha can be short or long depending on the quantity of the first syllable of the following word (the semivowel comes before the vowel, and so doesn‚Äôt close the syllable). We pronounce <i>it<b>a u</b>t √¶quum fuerat</i> as [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">&#39;…™.taÃØ ä.&#39;ta…õÃØ.k äÃÉ.&#39;f ä. ∑…õ.…æat</SPAN>], where the syllable with the synal≈ìpha [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">taÃØ ä</SPAN>] remains as short as if it had been [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">t ä</SPAN>] or [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">t…æ ä</SPAN>], whereas a diphthong [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">ta äÃØ</SPAN>] would have made it as long as say [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">ta…õÃØ</SPAN>] or [<SPAN face="SILDoulos IPA93" size="2">tar</SPAN>].</SPAN></p>
