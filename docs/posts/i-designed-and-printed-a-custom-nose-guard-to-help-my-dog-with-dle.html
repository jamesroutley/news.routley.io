    <h1>I designed and printed a custom nose guard to help my dog with DLE</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-framer-name="Content" data-framer-component-type="RichTextContainer"><p>When our pitbull Billie was diagnosed with Discoid Lupus Erythematosus (DLE), we had no idea how much our lives, and hers were about to change. This is the story of how desperation, love, and a 3D printer led to the creation of SnoutCover.</p><h2>The Beginning: When Everything Changed</h2><p>Billie&#39;s nose started changing gradually. At first, we thought it was just normal aging—her beautiful black nose began losing pigment, turning pink in patches. But then came the crusting, the scaling, and worst of all, the pain.</p><p>Every time she bumped her nose, even slightly, she would yelp. The skin became so fragile that minor contact would cause bleeding. The once-smooth &#34;cobblestone&#34; texture of her nose disappeared, replaced by raw, damaged tissue that seemed to get worse with each passing day.</p><p><img alt="Billie after surgery" width="413" height="551" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/R1lrNcmGASZu6305rbyWNRJ6WA.jpeg" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/R1lrNcmGASZu6305rbyWNRJ6WA.jpeg?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=827&amp;height=1103 767w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/R1lrNcmGASZu6305rbyWNRJ6WA.jpeg?width=827&amp;height=1103 827w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/></p><h3>The Sun Made Everything Worse</h3><p>Our vet confirmed what we feared: Discoid Lupus Erythematosus. The autoimmune disease was causing Billie&#39;s immune system to attack the healthy cells on her nose. Sunlight made it exponentially worse—UV rays triggered flare-ups that left her in visible discomfort.</p><p>The treatment plan seemed simple enough: apply medicated ointment, use sunscreen, and keep her out of direct sunlight. But anyone who&#39;s tried to keep medication on a dog&#39;s nose knows the immediate problem—they lick it off within seconds.</p><p><img alt="Billie Sunbathing" width="379" height="505" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/whh7Lcim73bicwHFgvoicGBEmek.jpeg" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/whh7Lcim73bicwHFgvoicGBEmek.jpeg?width=759&amp;height=1011 759w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/></p><h2>The Frustrating Search for Solutions</h2><p>We tried everything available on the market:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Sunscreen balms</strong> – Licked off immediately</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Fabric nose shields</strong> – She rubbed them off constantly</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Keeping her indoors</strong> – Reduced her quality of life drastically</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Reapplying medication constantly</strong> – Exhausting and ineffective</p></li></ul><p>Nothing worked. We watched helplessly as Billie&#39;s condition worsened. The bleeding became more frequent. She became hesitant to play, clearly associating activity with the pain of bumping her sensitive nose.</p><p><img alt="Billie&#39;s poor nose" width="450" height="600" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/SdTzRjzE2idYyKM0ZnKUxPlQKw.jpeg" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/SdTzRjzE2idYyKM0ZnKUxPlQKw.jpeg?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=900&amp;height=1200 768w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/SdTzRjzE2idYyKM0ZnKUxPlQKw.jpeg?width=900&amp;height=1200 900w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/></p><p>We needed something that would: protect her nose from UV rays, prevent her from licking off medication, stay securely in place, allow her to breathe, eat, and drink normally, and actually be comfortable enough that she&#39;d tolerate wearing it.</p><p>That solution didn&#39;t exist. So we decided to create it.</p><h2>The Design Process: Iteration After Iteration</h2><p>With access to a 3D printer and a lot of determination, I began designing what would become SnoutCover. The challenge was creating something that seemed simple but was actually incredibly complex.</p><p><img alt="SnoutCover iterations 1-5" width="540" height="303" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/1QPb1jH7ZF4b5KYvgjPkyw2MWZQ.webp" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/1QPb1jH7ZF4b5KYvgjPkyw2MWZQ.webp?scale-down-to=512&amp;width=1080&amp;height=607 512w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/1QPb1jH7ZF4b5KYvgjPkyw2MWZQ.webp?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1080&amp;height=607 1024w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/1QPb1jH7ZF4b5KYvgjPkyw2MWZQ.webp?width=1080&amp;height=607 1080w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/></p><h3>The Learning Curve</h3><p>The first five prototypes were solely for measurements and made from PLA. I never intended to use PLA for the final product, but it was the quickest way to test initial dimensions. Measuring Billie’s nose with a cold calliper was a challenge in itself—she squirmed every time.</p><p><img alt="SnoutCover iteration 6" width="540" height="720" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/z4rvVS9gzETa0VV1b3GdB02cYSk.webp" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/z4rvVS9gzETa0VV1b3GdB02cYSk.webp?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1440 768w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/z4rvVS9gzETa0VV1b3GdB02cYSk.webp?width=1080&amp;height=1440 1080w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/></p><h3>The Breakthrough: Version 6</h3><p>By iteration six, I switched to TPU for its flexibility and comfort, and this was the first usable model. While it fit well, it lacked ventilation, which made it moist and uncomfortable for Billie.</p><p>After weeks of testing and redesign, we finally had something that worked—with:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Flexible TPU construction</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Strategic ventilation holes</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Adjustable strap system</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Minimal coverage design</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p>Smooth print orientation</p></li></ul><p>Iterations 7–10 focused on ventilation—adding holes to keep her nose moist while ensuring sunlight couldn’t penetrate and cause further damage. Balancing functionality and comfort was tricky, but each version improved on the last.</p><p><img alt="SnoutCover iteration 7" width="540" height="720" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/G9jE1L2QoBUC9q7F8bHdGlZcu4.webp" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/G9jE1L2QoBUC9q7F8bHdGlZcu4.webp?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1440 768w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/G9jE1L2QoBUC9q7F8bHdGlZcu4.webp?width=1080&amp;height=1440 1080w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/><img alt="SnoutCover iterations 8-10" width="540" height="720" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/qRZAuEqesZERqTgVGOiYO5IJdEc.webp" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/qRZAuEqesZERqTgVGOiYO5IJdEc.webp?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1440 768w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/qRZAuEqesZERqTgVGOiYO5IJdEc.webp?width=1080&amp;height=1440 1080w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/><img alt="Billie wearing SnoutCover iteration no.9" width="540" height="720" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/m1Ba0ysalM4w0jWaw9HYVxZtyw.webp" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/m1Ba0ysalM4w0jWaw9HYVxZtyw.webp?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1440 768w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/m1Ba0ysalM4w0jWaw9HYVxZtyw.webp?width=1080&amp;height=1440 1080w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/></p><p>By iteration 11, I had a design that worked. It protected her nose, allowed her to breathe, and stayed in place without causing discomfort. This version gave me the confidence to push further, leading to iteration 12—a more “armored” version for durability and obviously a tough looking dawg.</p><p><img alt="SnoutCover iterations 11-12" width="540" height="720" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/29pxyLyFh6V5NyCokGc8336t6o.webp" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/29pxyLyFh6V5NyCokGc8336t6o.webp?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1440 768w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/29pxyLyFh6V5NyCokGc8336t6o.webp?width=1080&amp;height=1440 1080w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/><img alt="Billie wearing SnoutCover iteration no.11" width="540" height="720" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/J2ulGewUOCpqgAJ3TIXKNr3L34.webp" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/J2ulGewUOCpqgAJ3TIXKNr3L34.webp?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1440 768w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/J2ulGewUOCpqgAJ3TIXKNr3L34.webp?width=1080&amp;height=1440 1080w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/></p><h2>The Transformation: Five Months That Changed Everything</h2><p>As her nose began to heal, I designed iteration 13, a shorter version with a smaller footprint, to give her more freedom while still providing protection. For the holidays, I even made her a bright pink version, giving her a fashionable edge.</p><p>With SnoutCover protecting her nose and keeping medication in place, we finally saw progress:</p><ul><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Month 1:</strong> The bleeding stopped.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Month 2:</strong> The crusting began to reduce.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Month 3:</strong> Pigment beginning to return.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Month 4:</strong> Texture started improving.</p></li><li data-preset-tag="p"><p><strong>Month 5:</strong> Her nose was fully black again. She was pain-free.</p></li></ul><p><img alt="SnoutCover iteration 13" width="540" height="720" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/vfrnyAq1hifUSeh16xhVsHdUkAM.webp" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/vfrnyAq1hifUSeh16xhVsHdUkAM.webp?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1440 768w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/vfrnyAq1hifUSeh16xhVsHdUkAM.webp?width=1080&amp;height=1440 1080w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/></p><p><img alt="Billie wearing SnoutCover iteration no.13" width="540" height="960" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/h8PStp6p3LZmlfjdFcnLYuObE.webp" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/h8PStp6p3LZmlfjdFcnLYuObE.webp?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1080&amp;height=1920 576w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/h8PStp6p3LZmlfjdFcnLYuObE.webp?width=1080&amp;height=1920 1080w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/></p><h2>Why I am Sharing This</h2><p>When I posted about Billie&#39;s recovery on Reddit and MakerWorld, the response was overwhelming. I realized this wasn&#39;t just Billie&#39;s story—it was a problem affecting dogs everywhere.</p><p><img alt="Billie with healthy nose after using SnoutCover" width="580" height="690" src="https://framerusercontent.com/images/VqGJHQrUDTQ8NHubCkmsm4GJxPo.jpg" srcset="https://framerusercontent.com/images/VqGJHQrUDTQ8NHubCkmsm4GJxPo.jpg?scale-down-to=1024&amp;width=1160&amp;height=1380 860w,https://framerusercontent.com/images/VqGJHQrUDTQ8NHubCkmsm4GJxPo.jpg?width=1160&amp;height=1380 1160w" data-framer-original-sizes="" sizes="(min-width: 1920px) 100vw, (min-width: 1200px) and (max-width: 1919.98px) 100vw, (min-width: 810px) and (max-width: 1199.98px) 100vw, (max-width: 809.98px) 100vw"/></p><h2>Billie Today</h2><p>Today, Billie is thriving. Her nose remains healthy and black. She&#39;s back to playing fetch, going on long walks, and living her best pitbull life without pain or restriction.</p><h2>A Note to Other Dog Parents</h2><p>If your dog is suffering from DLE or any nose condition, I want you to know: there is hope. SnoutCover was born from love, frustration, and the refusal to accept that Billie&#39;s suffering was just &#34;how it is.&#34;</p><p><strong>Billie&#39;s recovery gave birth to SnoutCover. We hope it can give your dog the same chance at healing she had.</strong></p><h2>Sharing This with the Community</h2><p>I know there are other dogs and owners out there facing similar struggles. That’s why I’m sharing this design for free. While it’s not adjustable by design, it should fit medium-to-large dogs as is. If needed, measurements can be adjusted using the scaling feature in your slicer software, but some slots, like those for the straps, might deform in the process.</p><p>This model is printed in TPU to ensure it’s soft, flexible, and comfortable for your dog. The front and side ventilation holes keep your dog’s nose moist while preventing overheating.</p><p>This experience taught me not just about 3D printing and design, but about patience, empathy, and the lengths we’ll go for the ones we love. If you’re a dog owner dealing with DLE, I hope this story inspires you and gives you a tool to help your furry companion.</p><p>You can find the design on Makerworld, named SnoutCover, make adjustments if needed, and let’s help our pups live their best lives. ❤️</p></div></div>
