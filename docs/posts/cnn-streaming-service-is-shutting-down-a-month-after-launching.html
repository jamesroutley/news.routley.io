    <h1>CNN&#43; streaming service is shutting down a month after launching</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
         <p>CNN is shutting down its streaming service CNN+ about a month after it launched, a sign of its new ownersâ€™ lack of faith in the viability of a subscription-based stand-alone news platform.</p>
         <p>The decision to pull the plug on CNN+, which was off to an underwhelming start, came less than two weeks after CNN ownership shifted from AT&amp;T Inc. to a newly created company called  Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.,  the result of a merger of the entertainment and news assets of the telecom giant and Discovery.</p>
