<ul>
<li>had to really (bully and) cajole myself to write this one. Very low energy day.</li>
<li>haven&#39;t posted L for alphabet superset or been working enough on other projects. Very low energy week.<details>
<summary>Very low energy?</summary>
i don&#39;t think any of my low energy is to the point of being clinically concerning - well, i know it isn&#39;t as every time it&#39;s been bad enough to talk to a doctor they do blood tests and wave me off - and either way it&#39;s very mild in comparison to people who struggle with long COVID or other severe fatigue things. It&#39;s still bloody annoying to be mentally tired very easily at times, and I hope I can get to the bottom of it (sleep apnea? lack of vitamin d? something else?) soon.
</details>
</li>
<li>given low energy i am trying to give myself grace. it is very difficult. why can&#39;t i just be full of energy and highly productive every day of my life? too much to ask?</li>
<li>looking forward to <a href="https://piccalil.li/complete-css/">Complete CSS</a> coming out sometime this quarter!</li>
<li>What makes you optimistic about the web? I asked on bluesky and will ask on mastodon too tomorrow, feel free to reply over there or in an email! &#34;Nothing&#34; is a fine answer but not one I will reply to!</li>
<li>Very nearly finished Meditations for Mortals, it&#39;s giving 3.5 out of 5. The good chapters are very good, but a few pissed me off. 4000 weeks is better.</li>
