    <h1>Always Own Your Platform (2019)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>You know, it wasn&#39;t that long ago.</p>
<p>There was RSS.</p>
<p>There were blogs.</p>
<p>There were sub-groups and communities. The weirdos found each other. The non-weirdos found each other. It wasn&#39;t perfect. But it was distributed. It was ours.</p>
<p>It was yours.</p>
<p>Now? The original dream of the web is dying. Facebook, Google, Twitter, Medium, and YouTube entice us to give them our creative work.</p>
<p>They control what gets amplified and what gets monetized. A few conference rooms in Silicon Valley dictate our online culture.</p>

<p>Stop giving away your work to people who don&#39;t care about it. Host it yourself. Distribute it via methods you control. Build your audience deliberately and on your own terms.</p>
<p>Be in charge of the relationship with your audience.</p>
<p>Deliver value and then ask for money. Avoid unnecessary middlemen.</p>


<p>Do you see someone in the wild, not owning their platform? Let them know:</p>
