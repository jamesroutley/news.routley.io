<p>Hi everyone,</p>



<p>I’m Luca Ferrari, a co-founder and the CEO of Bending Spoons—a technology company that owns and develops a suite of category-leading consumer products including Remini (an AI-powered photo enhancer), Splice (a mobile video editor), and Evernote (a personal productivity app). </p>



<p>Meetup is a community-based product, so it’s fitting that I share the news with the Meetup community personally: on Friday, January 5, Bending Spoons entered into an agreement to become the new owner of Meetup, subject to closing conditions. The acquisition is expected to close later in January.</p>



<p>Meetup has a powerful global brand, a large, vibrant user base, and a mission that resonates strongly. Quite simply, Meetup is a force for good in the world, and it’s a pleasure and a privilege to become the new steward. We’re eager to support Meetup’s future success by drawing from the expertise we’ve developed in a decade of building high-performing digital technology products.</p>



<p>Once we officially take the reins you’ll hear more from us, including about future plans. In the meantime, I want to congratulate the Meetup team on building such a wonderful, beloved product. And I want to thank you, the organizers and members, for embracing Meetup and its mission so enthusiastically. We can’t wait to get to work on this exciting project!</p>



<p>See you later in January,</p>



<p>—Luca.</p>
