Cookies</h3><p> Winamp may use ʻCookiesʼ to help better understand user behaviour. A cookie is a small text file that is sent on Your computer or other device and stored on Your hard drive or device memory. Winamp is using the following cookies to keep records of Your visits, to better tailor Your future visits to Your preferences and generally to improve Your navigational experience. In using these cookies, Winamp delivers a more personalized experience on the WebSite.</p><p> In the framework of the use of the WebSite, cookies may be placed on Your device to collect both anonymous data and Personal Data related to You as specified in this Winamp Privacy Policy.</p><p> When You visit the WebSite for the first time, information on privacy and wording regarding the consent to the use of cookies will appear through a “cookie banner”. If You continue to actively use the WebSite and do not actively object to the use of cookies, You agree to Winamp’s use of cookies and such consent will be stored in Your browser, so that the information of the “cookie banner” does not have to be repeated on every page of the WebSite or at Your next connection. In the event that Your consent would no longer be registered in Your browser (e.g. in case of suppression of the cookies), the “cookie banner” will appear again the next time You visit the Website.</p><p> Winamp installs and uses certain technically required cookies on Your device which do not require Your prior consent. Other cookies (such as cookies to improve the navigational experience by keeping record of certain data (this avoids You having to reintroduce such data at each connection) and by tailoring the content of the WebSite to Your preferences) may be installed and used on the basis of Your consent. You may, at any time, delete or block cookies in Your browser parameters. However, in such case, some functionalities of the WebSite requiring the use of cookies may no longer be available to You.</p><p> Winamp uses analytics cookies to gather general information on how users use the WebSite (e.g. which pages they visit most frequently). These cookies do not collect any data that may lead to an identification of the users. All information collected with the aid of such cookies exclusively serves the purpose of understanding and improving the functionality of the WebSite. Winamp uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). The information regarding Your use of the WebSite generated by the use of Google Analytics is usually transmitted to and stored on a Google server in the USA. However, the code “gat._anonymizeIp();” has been added to Google Analytics on the WebSite to ensure anonymous recording of IP addresses, known as “IP masking”. Google IP address anonymization on the WebSite truncates Your IP address within the European Union and European Economic Area territories. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be sent to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. Google will use this information on Winamp’s behalf to analyze Your use of the WebSite, compile reports on Website activity and provide other WebSite and internet usage-related services. The IP address transmitted by Your browser as part of Google Analytics is not merged with other Google data. You can prevent data generated and recorded by the cookie concerning Your use of the WebSite (including Your IP address) from being sent to Google and prevent the processing of these data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via the link https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. Additional information on the Terms of Use and Data Privacy Policy of Google Analytics may be found at https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/ and https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/.</p><h3> 6. Protection of Personal Data - security measures</h3><p> Winamp takes the security of Your Personal Data very seriously. Winamp implements policy, rules and security measures targeting the protection of Personal Data.</p><p> Winamp diligently updates, corrects and eliminate Personal Data that are inaccurate, incomplete or irrelevant.</p><p> Winamp warrants that, for persons acting under its authority, access to Personal Data and the possibilities for processing these Personal Data are limited to what is needed by these persons for the exercise of their duties.</p><p> Winamp informs persons acting under its authority of the provisions of the GDPR, as well as any relevant requirements concerning protection of privacy in the processing of Personal Data.</p><p> Winamp ascertains compliance of programmes used for automatic processing of Personal Data and monitors the regularity of their application. Winamp ascertains that any person who has access to Personal Data can only process such Personal Data on instructions of Winamp, except in the case of an obligation imposed by or in virtue of the law, a decree or a court order.</p><p> Winamp takes the necessary technical and organizational measures to safeguard against accidental or unauthorized destruction, accidental loss and modification, access or any other unauthorized processing of Personal Data.</p><p> These measures ensure an adequate level of protection in view, on one hand, of the state of techniques in the field and the costs entailed for the application of these measures and, on the other hand, of the nature of the Personal Data to be protected and the potential risks.</p><h3> 7. When is Personal Data processing entrusted to a subcontractor and when are Personal Data disclosed?</h3><p> You acknowledge that Winamp may disclose Your Personal Data to its subcontractors for the above-mentioned purposes, both inside and outside the European Economic Area, namely xxx.</p><p> You acknowledge that this may involve transfers of Your Personal Data to countries that do not provide an adequate level of protection. Appropriate contractual measures will be taken to ensure the security of Your Personal Data in compliance with the applicable privacy and personal data protection legislation. A copy of those appropriate contractual measures can be provided upon request. Winamp will always choose a subcontractor that provides sufficient guarantees with regard to technical and organizational security measures concerning dataprocessing.</p><p> Winamp may also transmit Personal Data on the request of a judicial or administrative authority by virtue of applicable law.</p><h3> 8. Duration of retention of Personal Data</h3><p> The Personal Data collected will be erased six (6) months after You unsubscribed from the Winamp Services for which You have registered on the WebSite, unless Winamp has a legal obligation to retain some Personal Data for a longer period of time.</p><p> Some anonymised data may be kept thereafter exclusively for statistical purposes.</p><h3> 9. Your rights</h3><p> You can ask to Winamp, by sending an e-mail to <a href="https://www.winamp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6616140f1007051f26110f08070b164805090b"><span data-cfemail="99e9ebf0eff8fae0d9eef0f7f8f4e9b7faf6f4">[email protected]</span></a>., whether Winamp processes some of Your Personal Data.</p><p> You can also access and help Winamp ensure Your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete and up to date by sending a request in this sense by e-mail to Winamp.</p><p> You can (i) ask Winamp to provide You with a copy of Your Personal Data, (ii) request that Winamp corrects Your Personal Data if it is inaccurate or, in some cases, delete Personal Data unless Winamp has a legal obligation to retain some Personal Data.</p><p> You also have the right to ask for the restriction of the processing or to object to the processing of Personal Data relating to You as well as the right to data portability (as the case may be). When applicable, You have the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent made prior to such withdrawal.</p><p> You can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority (in particular in the Member State of the European Union of Your usual place of residence, place of work or the place where the violation occurred) if You consider that the processing of Personal Data related to You infringes the data protection legislation.</p><p> Please note that access, modifications, corrections, deletion requests can be made usually through a request sent by e-mail at <a href="https://www.winamp.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d2a2a0bba4b3b1ab92a5bbbcb3bfa2fcb1bdbf"><span data-cfemail="7a0a08130c1b19033a0d13141b170a54191517">[email protected]</span></a>..

Others</h3><p> This Winamp Privacy Policy shall not restrict the rights that Winamp may have with regard to any natural person in virtue of specific agreements or other piece of legislation.</p><p> Winamp may update its Winamp Privacy Policy from time to time. When Winamp updates its Privacy Policy, a notification will be posted on the WebSite at the occasion of Your connexion to the WebSite.</p><p><i> Last version updated on November 15th, 2021</i>
