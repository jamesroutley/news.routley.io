  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the <strong>classic Busy Beaver game</strong> we ask: what is the longest that a Turing machine program of N states and K colors can run before halting when started on the blank tape? The basic approach to solving this problem is to generate a list of candidate programs, then subject each program to a sequence of <strong>deciders</strong>, where a decider is a function that takes a program as input and returns a result of type <code>Option&lt;bool&gt;</code>. This result is interpreted as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Some(true)</code>: the program provably halts</li>
  <li><code>Some(false)</code>: the program provably does not halt</li>
  <li><code>None</code>: haltingness could not be determined</li>
</ul>

<p>Proving non-haltingness means <strong>refuting the possibility of halting</strong>, usually by showing that the program’s halt conditions are unreachable.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental methods for refuting haltingness is <strong>backward reasoning</strong>. The idea is to start with a program’s halt conditions and work backwards, reconstructing possible paths that could have reached it. If it can be shown that there are no valid paths, then the program’s haltingness is refuted.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil">    +-----+-----+
    |  0  |  1  |
+---+-----+-----+
| A | 1RB | 0LA |
+---+-----+-----+
| B | 1LA | --- |
+---+-----+-----+</code></pre></figure>

<p>This program halts if it scans a <code>1</code> while in state <code>B</code>. Other than the scanned <code>1</code>, the tape contents don’t matter. In other words, the <strong>halt configuration</strong> is:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil">B1 | ? [1] ?</code></pre></figure>

<p>The goal now is to figure out the previous configuration. There is only one instruction that reaches state <code>B</code>, and that’s <code>A0 : 1RB</code>. The machine must have been in state <code>A</code> scanning a <code>0</code>, and since that instruction moves right, that <code>0</code> must have been to the left of the current head. The tape contents are unknown other than the current scanned <code>1</code>, so it is <strong>consistent</strong> that a <code>0</code> be at that spot. The previous configuration must therefore have been:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil">A0 | ? [0] 1 ?</code></pre></figure>

<p>Repeating the process, there are two instructions that lead to state <code>A</code>: <code>A1 : 0LA</code> and <code>B0 : 1LA</code>. Both of these instructions go to the left, so they must have come from the right. <code>A1 : 0LA</code> writes a <code>0</code>, but the cell to the right of the scan contains a <code>1</code>. So the <code>A1</code> instruction is impossible. The <code>B0</code> instruction is consistent with the tape contents, so we move on to the next configuration:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil">B0 | ? 0 [0] ?</code></pre></figure>

<p>As before, the only possible instruction that could reach this is <code>A0 : 1RB</code>. But that instruction writes a <code>1</code>, while the cell to the left has a <code>0</code>. So the instruction is impossible. There are no other configurations to consider, so we can conclusively say that <strong>this program cannot halt</strong>.</p>

<p>The full sequence of configurations looks like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil">1 | B1 | ? [1] ?

2 | A0 | ? [0] 1 ?

3 | B0 | ? 0 [0] ?</code></pre></figure>

<p>We call this a <strong>backward refutation of length 3 and width 1</strong>.</p>

<p>Here is a more complicated example:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil">    +-----+-----+
    |  0  |  1  |
+---+-----+-----+
| A | 1RB | 0LA |
+---+-----+-----+
| B | 0RC | 1RC |
+---+-----+-----+
| C | 1LA | --- |
+---+-----+-----+</code></pre></figure>

<p>As before, we start with the single halting configuration:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil">C1 | ? [1] ?</code></pre></figure>

<p>How was this configuration reached? This time there are <strong>two possibilities</strong>: <code>B0 : 0RC</code> and <code>B1 : 1RC</code>. Both instructions are consistent with the tape contents, so both must be considered:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil">B0 | ? [0] 1 ?
B1 | ? [1] 1 ?</code></pre></figure>

<p>The same process must now be repeated for <strong>both of these branches</strong>. Here is the full sequence of configurations:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="nil"> 1 | C1 | ? [1] ?

 2 | B0 | ? [0] 1 ?
 2 | B1 | ? [1] 1 ?

 3 | A0 | ? [0] 0 1 ?
 3 | A0 | ? [0] 1^2 ?

 4 | A1 | ? 0 [1] 1 ?
 4 | C0 | ? 0 [0] 1 ?

 5 | C0 | ? 0 1 [0] ?
 5 | B0 | ? [0] 0 1 ?

 6 | B1 | ? 0 [1] 0 ?
 6 | A0 | ? [0] 0^2 1 ?

 7 | A1 | ? 0 [1] 0 1 ?

 8 | A1 | ? 0 1 [1] 1 ?

 9 | C0 | ? 0 1^2 [0] ?

10 | B1 | ? 0 1 [1] 0 ?

11 | A0 | ? 0 [0] 1 0 ?

12 | C0 | ? 0^2 [0] 0 ?

13 | B0 | ? 0 [0] 0^2 ?</code></pre></figure>

<p>This is a <strong>backward refutation of length 13 and width 2</strong> – width 2 because that is the maximum number of configurations at any step.</p>

<p>In these examples, we have seen a 2-state 2-color program with a refutation of length 2 and a 3-state 2-color program with a refutation of length 13. Are there any longer ones? Perhaps you can see where this is going. We can ask the general <strong>Busy Beaver Backward</strong> question: <strong>among backward-refutable programs of N states and K colors, what is the length of the longest refutation?</strong></p>

<p>(What would be a good name for this function? <strong>BBBack</strong>? <em>I want my BBBack, BBBack, BBBack, …</em>)</p>

<p>I will claim tentatively that these values are in fact the <strong>winners</strong>: the longest 2/2 refutation has length 2 and the longest 3/2 refutation has length 13. I don’t have a proof, although whatever the true values are, they are certainly provable.</p>

<p>Here are the best values that I have been able to find, along with their witnessing programs:</p>

<p>I would be very interested to know if these values can be beaten. Alternatively, if there is a bug in my backward reasoner and any of the values are illegitimate, I would be very interested to know that too.</p>

<p>A trend that shows up in this data is that longer refutations correlate with more states and fewer colors. This is because more colors means <strong>exponentially more backward branching possibilities</strong>, and this tends to foil the backward reasoning method. I interpret this as yet more evidence that <strong>colors are more powerful than states</strong>.</p>

    <p>Verify the claimed BBBack values, or find better ones, or show that they are illegitimate.</p>

    <p>How can the backward reasoning method be used to prove haltingness?</p>

    <p>A similar question is: among backward-refutable programs of N states and K colors, what is the <strong>width</strong> of the <strong>widest refutation</strong>? Find the best values for this function and exhibit their witnessing programs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Is BBBack computable? Why or why not?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Backward reasoning can be used to refute haltingness, but it can be used for other conditions as well. Use backward reasoning to show that the following programs <strong>cannot erase the tape</strong>. How many steps do they take?</p>
