      <blockquote>The Vatican Observatory is one of the oldest active astronomical observatories in the world, with its roots going back to 1582 and the reform of the Julian calendar.</blockquote>
      <p>Today there are more than a dozen Jesuit scientists from many different countries on the staff of the Observatory, who study the universe through solid, scientific methods.</p>
      <p>They stand at the forefront of scientific research covering a broad range of topics, from an examination of the tiniest specs of interplanetary dust to the origins and structure of the universe.</p>
      <p>The Jesuit astronomers of the Vatican Observatory have contributed to discoveries in many fields from the origins of our solar system to the structure of galaxies.</p>

      <p>Scientists throughout the world recognize their work in planetary sciences, cosmology and philosophy, and stellar and extragalactic astronomy.</p>
      <blockquote>The Observatory has its headquarters in the gardens of the Papal Summer Residence in Castel Gandolfo, an hour south of Rome and the Vatican City State, and a research center, the Vatican Observatory Research Group, in Tucson, Arizona, one of the most important centers in the world for observational astronomy.</blockquote>
      <p>Most of the observational research today takes place at the Observatoryâ€™s telescope on Mt. Graham in Arizona, about a hundred miles east of Tucson.</p>
      <p>Besides serving as the home for four historic telescopes, the headquarters outside Rome also houses an important archive of astronomical photographic plates dating from the late 19th century; a library with a number of historically important scientific works; a collection of antique astronomical instruments; and one of the most important meteorite collections in the world, which are studied in a recently renovated state of the art meteorite laboratory.</p>
