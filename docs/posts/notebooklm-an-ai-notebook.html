        <div><p data-block-key="wrbmq">At Google I/O this year we introduced a number of AI-first experiments in development, including <a href="http://notebooklm.google.com/signup">Project Tailwind</a> — a new kind of notebook designed to help people learn faster.</p><p data-block-key="bp4la">Today we’re beginning to roll out Project Tailwind with its new name: <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com/signup">NotebookLM</a>, an experimental offering from Google Labs. It’s our endeavor to reimagine what notetaking software might look like if you designed it from scratch knowing that you would have a powerful language model at its core: hence the LM. It will be immediately available to a small group of users in the U.S. as we continue to refine the product and make it more helpful.</p></div>

        <div><p data-block-key="wrbmq">NotebookLM is an experimental product designed to use the power and promise of language models paired with your existing content to gain critical insights, faster. Think of it as a virtual research assistant that can summarize facts, explain complex ideas, and brainstorm new connections — all based on the sources you select.</p><p data-block-key="8he48">A key difference between NotebookLM and traditional AI chatbots is that NotebookLM lets you “ground” the language model in your notes and sources. Source-grounding effectively creates a personalized AI that’s versed in the information relevant to you. Starting today, you can ground NotebookLM in specific Google Docs that you choose, and we’ll be adding additional formats soon.</p><p data-block-key="7c9e9">Once you’ve selected your Google Docs, you can do three things:</p><ul><li data-block-key="58a93"><b>Get a summary:</b> When you first add a Google Doc into NotebookLM, it will automatically generate a summary, along with key topics and questions to ask so you get a better understanding of the material.</li><li data-block-key="6mhmm"><b>Ask questions:</b> When you’re ready for a deeper dive, you can ask questions about the documents you’ve uploaded. For example:<ul><li data-block-key="5mniq">A medical student could upload a scientific article about neuroscience and tell NotebookLM to “create a glossary of key terms related to dopamine”</li><li data-block-key="3a9ai">An author working on a biography could upload research notes and ask a question like: “Summarize all the times Houdini and Conan Doyle interacted.”</li></ul></li><li data-block-key="9k9mv"><b>Generate ideas:</b> NotebookLM isn’t just for Q&amp;A. We’ve found some of its more delightful and useful capabilities are when it’s able to help people come up with creative new ideas. For example:<ul><li data-block-key="d158b">A content creator could upload their ideas for new videos and ask: “Generate a script for a short video on this topic.”</li><li data-block-key="be0fh">Or an entrepreneur raising money could upload their pitch and ask: “What questions would potential investors ask?”</li></ul></li></ul><p data-block-key="4t4o4">While NotebookLM’s source-grounding does seem to reduce the risk of model “hallucinations,” it’s always important to fact-check the AI’s responses against your original source material. When you&#39;re drawing on multiple sources, we make that fact-checking easy by accompanying each response with citations, showing you the most relevant original quotes from your sources.</p></div>
