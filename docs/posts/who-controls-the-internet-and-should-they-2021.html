</blockquote>
<p>Hello, and welcome to this presentation on who controls the internet,
and if they actually should.  As you can see, I cover all grounds
here.  All kinds of flags are in this presentation and all kinds of companies.</p>
<p><img src="https://berthub.eu/articles/who-controls.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>But don’t worry, none of them comes out well.  So first, introduction, who am
I?  My name is Bert Hubert.  I’m from the Netherlands.  I’m from Europe.
I’m the founder of PowerDNS and PowerDNS is an open-source name server
company that does around half of all DNS in Europe.</p>
<p>I no longer work there, but that’s my history since 1999.  After that, I
worked a few years for the Dutch intelligence agency, which gave me an all
new outlook on the internet and on the world.  After a while, I decided to
leave that again, to focus on PowerDNS.  And now, after many years, I have
recently moved back to the dark side again, and I’m now a judge on the
<a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/my-new-part-time-job/">sort of the Dutch FISA
court</a>, which regulates the intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>Why do I tell you this stuff?  In this presentation I’m going to spread a
lot of love or mostly hate on various countries and various companies and on
how they run the internet.  And I want you to be sure that you know I’m only
speaking on behalf of myself and on behalf of no one else.</p>
<p>During this time as an open source developer and a government worker, I have
seen quite a bit of the internet and who may be controlling it or not.</p>
<p>So who controls the internet?  We all have our dreams, our hopes, our heroes
on the internet, but also our favorite enemies of the internet.</p>
<p>And in this presentation, I’ll cover all of these and talk about who
actually controls the internet.  If you are not upset by the end of this
presentation, you were not paying attention.  Because no one comes out well.</p>
<p>The scope of who controls the internet is very broad.  So when I discussed
this presentation with people beforehand, many folks said, look, my local
internet exchange controls the internet or BGP controls the internet, or I
control the internet actually.</p>
<p>And that’s not really the scope of this presentation.  The scope of this
presentation is way bigger.  So who makes the internet fast for some people
and slow for others?  Who makes it easy to access some kinds of internet and
makes it hard to access other kinds of internet?  Who can make it cheap, who
can make it expensive?  So this is a far broader presentation than just
where do the packets go.</p>
<p>Finally important.  This presentation is not about us geeks because as
geeks, we are like, no one controls my internet.  I’m behind seven proxies,
I will always be able to get myself beyond any kind of internet control.</p>
<p>And that’s probably true.  Although I do know people that lived in China
that had to give it up, they said, look, this control is now so stringent, I can no
longer bypass it. This presentation is not so much about us and what we
could do.</p>
<p>It is about how normal people access the internet and how they go
online without too much trouble.  So this is not about well financed freedom
fighters, it is about how regular people around the world get access to
internet.</p>
<p><img src="https://berthub.eu/articles/igp.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>And it turns out there are quite some naive ideas behind that.  When I
discussed this presentation on Twitter earlier today the Internet Governance
Project came up and said, no one controls the internet because large complex
distributed systems are not controlled by “who’s”.</p>
<p>And I would like to tell that to the people in North Korea or Iran that
cannot access my content.  Actually people do control the internet around
the world and things maybe more complex than you think in other countries
because the world is a big place.</p>
<p>And we know very little strangely enough
about how the internet works in various countries.  For example, during
the recent big Facebook and WhatsApp outage, we found out that that many
parts of the internet of in many parts of the world, the internet actually
means the Facebook part of the internet, which is something I was not
actually aware of.</p>
<p>So who wants to control the internet?  Well, there are
democratically elected governments that say we have interests to protect.
There are authoritarian governments and regimes that say, well, we have to
protect ourselves.  And we want to make sure that the internet only has
happy news about us.</p>
<p>We have rights holders that say, we don’t want you to use the internet
to share our valuable intellectual property.  There are activists that say,
look, we want you to share this kind of content and not that kind of
content.</p>
<p>The big movers and shakers of this world right now are advertising
companies like Google, which influence the internet greatly so that they
can continue their way of life.</p>
<p>Corporations would like to exert control of the internet as do, of course
the schools and institutions, but also do not rule out yourself.</p>
<p>I’m all for an open and free internet.  And I want information to be free,
but not spam.  I do not want spam on my network.  I want an open and free
internet without controls, but I also believe in BCP 38.  So I don’t want
you to be using the wrong IP addresses.</p>
<p>So it is not just governments.  Really everyone wants to control the
internet at least for a little bit.  So that starts with the most controlled
bit of the internet in the world.</p>
<h3 id="north-korea">North Korea</h3>
<p>North Korea actually has a few people that are really on the internet and a
lot of people that are on Quangmyong or “bright light” North Korean intranet
the country is small enough that it all fits in a 10/8 and they have a sort of intranet
going on.  It is their own private internet, which they sadly are not
sharing with the world.</p>
<p>So we know very little about what is actually
on this Bright Light internet, but sometimes things leak.  So it turns
out they have their own email system, they have their own search engine.
They have a sort of highly curated Facebook and they even have video
conferencing solutions that they built themselves, which were used more during the Corona outbreak even.</p>
<p>And they have made their own specifically modified Android tablets and
they have a Linux operating system.  So these people really run their own
internet and it’s probably not even correct to call it an internet.
Of specific interest, their modified Android tablets are rumored
to be a fully controlled and setup to  keep track of
everything you do.  And that’s just terrible.</p>
<p>And then I realized that’s actually what actual Android tablets also do, but
they do it on behalf of advertisers.  And in this case, they do it on behalf
of the north Korean government.  The probably only had to change a few
domain names in the source code.</p>
<p>Why is this North Korea example relevant for the real internet?  It
may be that more and more countries will gravitate towards actually running
their own intranet, instead of being part of the big internet.</p>
<h3 id="china">China</h3>
<p>Furthest along in that is China and China actually sort of runs a shadow
internet.</p>
<p>They have their own root servers,  they have their own everything,
which of course it’s massively controlled.  It’s not a free place.  It
barely is the internet.  And it’s may be more fair to just call it Chinanet,</p>
<p>And they don’t just block information they don’t like they
also impose slowdowns or reset packets on content that they don’t
like.</p>
<p>So they have ways of signaling that look the information you are
looking for, you should not be looking for that.  Chinese people know to
interpret bad internet connections as, oh, maybe I shouldn’t be going there
and it’s actually sort of more effective than simply blocking everything.</p>
<p>Interestingly, China is one of the very few places in the world that could
actually disconnect itself from the internet.  They have enough parallel
stuff going on. They have their own payment systems, they have their own
cloud infrastructure. They have their own storage solutions.</p>
<p>If the internet in China were to be disconnected from the world, China would
keep on functioning.  And the other interesting thing is, is that they
apparently have some kind of board or whatever, because there are many
Chinese companies that are actually on Facebook and are on Twitter.  And
there are also individual scientists and space flight people, that are
somehow able to publicly go online, on websites that are otherwise banned.</p>
<p>It appears there is some kind of board there that can grant you access to
parts of the real internet.  And interestingly enough, we don’t really know
how the Chinese internet works.  And we should know far more about that
because many countries in the west are selling stuff in China and it would
be good if we all knew how that works there, but there is some sort of
cone of silence around the internet in China that no one is keeping track of
just how that works.</p>
<p>And which means that periodically people in the west suddenly discovered
that there is a whole different Chinese internet ecosystem out there that we
know very little about.</p>
<p>Does China run the internet? Well
these days they very much run their own internet.  But periodically they come
out and try to get the IETF or the ITU or other people to pass standards that
make the internet well, maybe more to China’s liking.</p>
<p>Their current efforts are rather ham-fisted in that respect.  I was
personally involved with an attempt from them, or at least they sent their
attempt to me for a sort of multi root internet, which would codify that
there is a Chinese internet and a real internet, and that you could switch
between these two.  But so far we’re not really interested in running their
“new IP” system.</p>
<h3 id="turkey-indonesia-iran">Turkey, Indonesia, Iran</h3>
<p>Well, there are lots of other countries, of course, that want to mess with
the internet for, for their own reasons.  And it turns out that it’s
quite difficult to block parts of the internet.  China can do it, but
they invested quite a bit in the great Chinese firewall and other
countries also want to do it, but they’re just not as good at it.  Or they
don’t have enough good people for it, or they don’t spend enough money on
it.  So Turkey, Indonesia, Iran all run DNS-based blocks or BGP
hijacks for content that they don’t like.  They may also try to block
the third-party DNS.  They might try to block DNS over HTTPS.</p>
<p>Iran, for example, is running some, not so very effective server server name
based (SNI) based blocking by which they can also block select TLS
traffic, but they’re just not very good at it.</p>
<p>And Turkey, for example,
blocked, the Wikipedia for around three years and which is
tremendously sad, of course, and they didn’t do a very good job of blocking
it because over the three years that they blocked it to Turkish Wikipedia
grew by 30,000 articles.  So apparently people could actually
access it.</p>
<p>A fun thing is that found out, I know a lot of people in Iran, I have some
sorta family members there, and they told me, yeah, we all use a VPN.  And I was
very impressed.  I thought these people are so privacy conscious.  And they
said, no, no, it’s the only way to get somewhat performant internet here.</p>
<p>Because if you don’t use a VPN, you go through the interception
infrastructure and it is like super overloaded.  So we use a VPN to get fast
internet and crucially, and I was very impressed by that, they said we
also have no hopes that the VPN actually gives us privacy, because they
were aware to many of the VPN providers out there are not actually that good
in terms of providing privacy. But at least they are good at providing
a faster internet in Iran.</p>
<p>So these are the countries that sort of want to block the internet to
control the internet, but they’re not quite succeeding at it.</p>
<h3 id="russia">Russia</h3>
<p>Russia has telecommunications agency called ROSKOMNADZOR and I have a
personal beef with them because they blocked my own domain
PowerDNS.COM for years and years and years.  And we tried to find out how
and why, and what have we done wrong?  Sometimes PowerDNS gets
blocked because there are people that block anything that has to do with
alternative DNS, but that wasn’t it.</p>
<p>And we found out that previously ROSKOMNADZOR had been waging war on various
internet services and they were not winning that war.  So they were simply
blocking huge amounts of IP space from Amazon and Digital Ocean.  And they
blocked like millions of IP addresses, including, by accident, PowerDNS.  So,
then I felt doubly bad because I was censored in Russia and I was sort of
proud about that.  And then I found out it was by accident.</p>
<p>Over time, Russia learned that this wide blocking hurt the economy too much
because unlike China, they don’t yet have a homegrown payment system or homegrown
clouds that are good enough.  So if Russia decides to block too much of the
internet, their own country suffers too much.</p>
<p>But they’re trying to get more homegrown payment infrastructure, which
would allow them to do more of the internet themselves and would allow them
to block other people’s internet more easily.</p>
<h3 id="the-united-kingdom">The United Kingdom</h3>
<p>That brings us to the United Kingdom.  The United Kingdom is an outlier in the sense that it’s a big country.  It’s an important country.
They have lots of people there.  And strangely enough, they have an
active internet censorship program going on, which is not quite legally
enforced.</p>
<p>So the UK government told all the large scale internet
access providers, they said, look, you must provide internet child safe
internet by default.  And there’s no legislation that forces them to do it.
But the government said, look, if you don’t do it voluntarily, we were going
to make some legislation for you.</p>
<p>And these ISP had to build this child safe internet infrastructure, which meant that they had to
instrument their backbone so that they could block all kinds of content.
And they bought big lists of data of sites that were not safe for children.</p>
<p>And while they were at it, they bought these big lists, that also categorize all
other sites.  And strangely enough, at least in one place that enabled an
ISP to filter so granularly that they could filter out shoe stores.</p>
<p>And I’m not sure why, why any engineer would build a block for shoe stores, but
apparently it happened.  And the weird thing is if you want to turn off
this child safe internet in the UK, you get a letter and they sent you this
letter that tells you, look, you opted out of the filtering.  Apparently you
want to look at adult material.</p>
<p>And you can find web forums, in the UK where people ask, well, what does this letter look like?  And when does
it arrive?  And what does on the envelope look like, all in hopes that they can
intercept that letter.  And these might be questions from husbands, from children.
It is a strange system.</p>
<p>The other notable thing about the UK is that they are mad for football over
there, everyone is mad for English
football.  So there is a lot of “unpaid” streaming going on.  And also many
lawsuits, which means that UK ISPs now routinely get court orders that say, you must block
the following illegal streaming sites.</p>
<p>And it has now gone so far that internet providers actually preemptively
hunt for these streamers.  So before big matches, they look what sites
suddenly get a lot more traffic.  It’s probably no accident if just before the
Arsenal match starts you suddenly you have 500 megabits of internet
going somewhere.  And then they block these sites.  So it is quite preemptive.</p>
<p>I don’t know the scale of this, but even this week, five service
providers were asked by courts to block a ton of streamers.</p>
<p>The final one is that the UK is working on its Online Safety Bill, which means that they’ve
created a new category of content called “lawful, but harmful” and access to
that content must somehow be regulated.  And they’re having a lot of soul
searching going on right now, what that means.</p>
<p>But importantly, they have already said that any foreign content provider that has business in the UK
will have to adhere to this “lawful, but harmful” content regulation.  So
the UK is making a strong effort to control the internet.</p>

<p>They love regulation.  So, the GDPR that worked for them
and everyone now has to deal with that.  Unless you have a billion year
budget for litigation and you don’t have to deal with that.</p>
<p>And they have now come up with a new directive, the Network Information
Security directive, version two, because the first one didn’t work,
where they want to say, look, these are vital bits of the internet or vital
bits of the society.  And we want to regulate you on how you deal with
getting hacked or how you deal with going down or whatever, so that you
report that.</p>
<p>And in theory, it all, it’s all full of nice ideas and it’s of
course good to report and do responsible disclosure and that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But they have also attempted to regulate the entire internet with that,
because they said the root servers of the internet are so important that
yeah, they fall into this legislation and you must report any downtime and
incidents to your local EU representative.  And if you are not in the EU,
you must pick representatives in the EU and report it there.</p>
<p>And this is not a very good idea. Together with the RIPE NCC and ISC, I
and other people have been working on trying to talk sense into the European
Union and the European parliament has now decided to put to the root servers out
of scope, which is really nice, but it’s not a done deal.  We’re still
working on it.</p>
<p>What else is going on? In various European countries at times, domain names or IP addresses get blocked.  And this is
usually after a very long court battle because courts are not in the habit
of just blocking stuff because you don’t like it.  And so you have to have
exhausted all your other remedies.  And then after several years of
lawsuits you often succeed in getting a European courts to order
ISP, to block access to certain content.  And this has typically not been
very successful because they blocked domain names, they sometimes look IP addresses and the people that want to get access to
Torrent, they also can use a different name server.</p>
<p>So they typically find
a way around it.</p>
<p>One of the more scarier things that is going on that in
Germany, the rights industry scans the internet for people doing Torrent
things or other file sharing.  Then they get a court order.  And then the
ISP has to cough up the details of the IP addresses that were found to be
sharing data.  And then you get a scary, a cease and desist letter.  And
it’s a really scary one in German.  Uh, many things are scarier in German, and then you have to pay a thousand euros or appeal, whatever.  And
it’s quite a scary thing.  We don’t have that in
other countries in Europe, but if you’re in Germany, this is
apparently a nasty letter to receive.</p>
<p>So in general, the European Union loves to regulate the internet.
Countries do come up with blocks from time to time.  These are not very
effective, but they do actually happen.</p>
<h3 id="the-united-states-of-america">The United States of America.</h3>
<p>And I’m happy to I’m presenting this to you.  Of course the US has a
very powerful first amendment.  So very often Americans will get really
upset when they hear that the courts can order a certain kinds of content to
be blocked in other countries or in Europe, because the first amendment!</p>
<p>And indeed the first amendment, is an exceptionally powerful piece of
legislation. And it has to be because it’s so important in
safeguarding your rights and freedoms, but is it all good?</p>
<p>And it turns out that there are quite a few ways in which you can block content
without actually blocking content.  So all of the world has to deal
with the US DMCA.</p>
<p>So everyone in the world gets the DMCA notifications, and we have to act on
them because if we don’t, the results are really bad.  Um, the US has quite
a big pull on the world.  So if the US doesn’t like what you are doing, you
get kicked out of payment systems.  So you have freedom to say what
you want.  You just don’t have freedom to get paid for it.</p>
<p>And then there
is the national security legislation from the US which is frighteningly
scary and powerful.  And let me explain a little bit how it works.</p>
<p>So the whole world is sort of afraid of the US national security
legislation, which is, can be good or bad.  But it is in any case fair
to say that this has a big influence on how people use the internet.</p>
<p>The other thing that’s interesting is that even though the first
amendment rights are really good in the US and I’m, I’m jealous of them, I
have to admit, I wish I had a first amendment.</p>
<p>But it turns out it’s
surprisingly easy in the US to impound a domain name.  So that means
that I have a domain name, the US doesn’t like it.  And suddenly my website
is replaced by this:</p>
<p><img src="https://berthub.eu/articles/police-art.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>And this happened to a VPN provider that’s somehow got law enforcement upset.  And
this was a .com name.  And apparently the US department of justice can show
up at Verisign or a registrar, and impound a domain name and
replace it with this police artwork that proudly says that your domain
has been taken down.</p>
<p>And of course, such things are nice when you are happy with such decisions,
when you think, Hey, it’s nice.  They took down this site full of
of drug trades or arms trades.  And that, of course, pretty good
stuff.</p>
<p>It is sort of frightening from the world’s perspective that
the US can impound .com domain names.  And they recently did that for
presstv.com, which was an Iranian propaganda site.  I’m also not in favor of Iranian propaganda, but
for the world at large, it’s a bit worrying that ..com domains
can simply be impounded.</p>
<p>So even though I much respect the US first amendment, it is not fair to say that the internet in America is
completely free, because there are many ways in which you can still be taken
offline, even though you have still have a lot of rights of free speech.</p>
<p>Now, this has been in sort of an array of what governments are
up to and how they are blocking the internet.  On the other side, we
have, of course, the big technology companies and they are sort of,
yeah, literally on the other side, they want to share information
and they typically also make big noises about keeping your information safe,
uh, from governments with, by using strong encryption, for example.</p>
<p>And that’s good by the way.  Um, but these companies have become so big.</p>
<p>And I
know that there’s a lot of debates about that, and I don’t want to enter
into section 230 stories, which are so important in the US that we even
even hear them here in Europe.  I just want to diagnose what is
going on.</p>
<p>If you have ever been on the naughty list of Google, YouTube,
Facebook, or Microsoft, where they have decided that your content is bad
for some reason, maybe they found malware on your site.  Maybe there was a
complaint about your site or whatever.</p>
<p>All these companies run private tribunals.</p>
<p>And in these tribunals, they decide that your site is no
longer safe and no one should be visiting it, or your sites should disappear
from view, or your site is no longer allowed to make money or
in the case of Microsoft specifically, your site is no longer allowed to
send email.</p>
<p>And these are decisions that are taken much like how authoritarian governments
do it.</p>
<p>But if you’re unhappy with the decision that your content was illegal you
cannot go, you can not appeal. You can not go to a higher court or go to the
“Google Supreme court” or whatever, and argue your case again.</p>
<p>Quite often there is only a button
that says, I am not happy with this decision and can you review it? Sometimes they even use words like, like appeal and
verdict, so it even
sounds a bit like a court, but these tribunals are very arbitrary.</p>
<p>We don’t know how they work.  We don’t know what procedures they run by.
Is there court the first instance?  Is
there even an appeal? And also quite often the first thing you notice that
someone has an issue with your content is the fact that you can no longer
Logan.  So suddenly everything is gone.</p>
<p>And there have been cases where people, for example, got their Google account blocked, so they couldn’t log
into their email anymore. And there were no longer able to communicate about their case.  And these
consequences are very dire.</p>
<p>So a friend of mine Con Kolivas is a Linux kernel developer, and anesthesiologist.  And he also developed a tool
called lrzip (long range zip), which is used in biology for example.  And it’s sadly
also used by malware authors for some reason.  And at some point Google Safe
Browsing decided that lrzip was a scary piece of technology, and it shouldn’t be visited.</p>
<p>And it was gone.  No one with any browser
could visit his page anymore because even non-Google browsers run checks
with Google Safe Browsing and Google safe browsing had decided that his
page was no longer safe, so no one could visit it anymore.</p>
<p>And I got involved with that and we tried to get an appeal going on.  We tried to get
someone to review, and it turns out that these processes on what gets
delisted are so arbitrary that even if you know lots of people over at
Google, it just happens.</p>
<p>And it took years to resolve this situation.  So this is actually sort
of quite authoritarian government behavior.  And there’s a term for this,
it’s called the kangaroo court.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A kangaroo court is court that ignores recognized standards of law or justice, carries little or no official standing in the territory within which it resides, and is typically convened ad hoc. A kangaroo court may ignore due process and come to a predetermined conclusion.“ - Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that has been around for a while where
companies or sports clubs or whatever, run their own sort of legal
systems and make their own ad hoc decisions without actually being formal
courts.  And this has historically been a very bad thing.</p>
<p>Then you have to realize that the world is bigger than Europe and the US and
other places. Even if there is a way to appeal that may
not be as open in all countries around the world.</p>
<p>So for example, the news from last week was that Facebook had apparently struck a deal
with the Vietnamese government where they said, this opposition content it’s anti-government, and we’re going to assist
you in blocking this.</p>
<p>Facebook is a private company that they can do whatever they want
apparently, but the access to appeal or to be unhappy with that is of
course, a lot better from the US or even from Europe than it is from
Vietnam.</p>
<p>And the people in Vietnam really, didn’t not have a lot of choice
in this.  So this is again a case where such an internal decision made
by big company on what is good and what is not good can be, have a very
big consequences.</p>
<p>This is another one that’s interesting.  It’s a sort
of nearly secret Facebook project, Facebook basics.  And this is a project
to got 1 billion people online on Facebook’s terms, and they’ve invested
in a big way, and they have not spoken a lot about this, but they have
sort of export that a free version of the internet to all the blue countries
on this map of Africa:</p>
<p><img src="https://berthub.eu/articles/africa.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>And if you try to find out how that works, then you only find
information for developers, how you can become part of the Facebook basics
program, which means that people in Africa can access your content for free,
but no one knows who gets on this internet, who doesn’t get on this
internet, who picks, who gets to be on it, can the opposition party also be
on it?  No one knows.</p>
<p>So these are again, sort of government-like decisions, government-like activities.  And we have no idea what’s
going on.</p>
<h3 id="transparency">Transparency</h3>
<p>We now know that that the big companies run their
own tribunals.  So it would be nice if we could see what they were doing.
And I have a lot of beef with this one.  If you try to find
out what a modern phone or a modern browser is doing, it will not tell
you.</p>
<p>So we may know, or remember from the past that you install certificates and
run a proxy server and inspect what comes out of a
browser. This is no longer true.  If you have a modern phone, you
can not run a proxy service for it to figure out what your phone is
sharing with the world about you.  It is impossible.</p>
<p>There was a paper from a university in Dublin two weeks ago, where they made
valiant attempts to figure out what Android apps are actually sending to their
mothership.  And they had to root their phone, reverse engineer it, replace certificates, and they were able to partially figure out what the
apps were doing.  But they even found out that once they had stripped the TLS
layer, that the data that was being snitched about users was often
super-encrypted using obfuscated AES keys.</p>
<p>And these Dublin researchers were unable to figure out what the phone was
actually sending to the mothership about you, the owner. This is being
sold as zero trust and as better for everyone.</p>
<p>Because the story you hear is that privacy means that the data is a well kept secret between
you and Google or you and Apple, and no one else should be able to see it.
Not even you apparently.</p>
<p>So the phone has its own enclave, where it sends information about you to
the cloud.  And it’s not going to tell you what it is sending, “for your own
good”.</p>
<p>And this leads to the harsh choice that if you have a device on your
network, a modern phone or a modern browser, or a modern Chromebook even,
you have to give it unimpeded and uninspectable access to the internet,
because the moment you try to figure out “what is my phone telling about me”
to it’s creator, then the phone ceases to function.  It will not allow you
to do that.</p>
<p>And that means that all control is now with the creators of phones and
browsers, which is pretty sad news for network operators and potentially
evil governments.  It’s not all bad.</p>
<p>But it is a combination that is worrying.  Behind this is an idea that if we
make information so well encrypted that no one can decrypt it, that this
will allow for perfect freedom around the world.</p>
<p>And it might just be, as explained in this XKCD comic, that things do not
quite work out like that.</p>
<p><img src="https://berthub.eu/articles/xkcd-security.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>So let’s say you are Russia, or you are Indonesia or Turkey.  And I mean,
it’s nice that it’s getting far harder to censor modern phones.  So it is
nice.  I mean, it’s a good raising the bar exercise.</p>
<p>I’m very fond of end to end encryption.  And I love privacy, but the idea
that we will then be giving safety to people accessing content that their
government doesn’t like, I’m not sure how that works, because every webpage
I visited is full of trackers.  That store exactly where I go and what sites
I visit and what my uh, latitude and longitude is and what apps I have
installed on my phone.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure if encrypting all the data is actually going to
protect people because there’s so much data being collected.  I am not sure
that all parties collecting the data will actually keep it secret from these
evil governments.  And we have not also seen that for example, in Russia,
phones must now be sold with mandatory governments apps and famous phone
manufacturers now apparently put these apps now on these phones and, I’m
sure it is very difficult for them to balance what they do.</p>
<p>And they probably try to keep a real good eye on these apps if they’re not snitching
on or endangering their users.  But it is nice that there is now end to end
encryption, but I’m not sure if this will actually deliver a super secure,
experience for everyone.</p>
<p>And the end result may be that authoritarian governments say, look, you made
it impossible for us to intercept traffic on the
network.  Fine we’re going to intercept traffic straight in the browser.  So
if you want to use the internet, we’ll have this hosted the browser for
you.  And you can use this hosted browser as much as you want,
because we’ve modified this browser that it keeps track of what you are
doing, much like is happening in North Korea right now.</p>
<p>And this brings in a whole new set of choices eventually for content
and communication providers - do we trust that the user has a safe browser?</p>
<h3 id="apple-and-microsoft">Apple and Microsoft</h3>
<p>I have not spoken a lot about Apple and Microsoft and I’ve promised I would
upset everyone in this presentation.  So I still have a little bit of work
to do.</p>
<p>I personally have been doing battle with Microsoft for many years, because whenever I tried to send email to
their users, I would end up in the spam folder.  So I could not effectively
for my self hosted email communicate with people using live.com or hotmail.com.</p>
<p>And this went on for
years, and this became sort of my personal quest to see what can I do to
solve this.  So I did everything.  I did the DMARC.  I did the SPF.  I logged
on to the Microsoft IP reputation program.  I signed contracts with them and
nothing worked.  And for many years, I could not send email to live.com
users or hotmail.com users, but I could send the email to Office365
users because they apparently get better spam filters.</p>
<p>But again, there was no way to appeal.  I could not talk to Microsoft
formally.  I could talk to Microsoft informally because I know a lot of people, and I
had a lot of useful contacts in the email industry, but even then I could not move the needle
there.  I couldn’t email to Microsoft users because Microsoft had decided that
I am not worthy to send email to their customers, and there was no
way to appeal.</p>
<p>Apple meanwhile, they dress it up very well.  And it’s very pretty,
but if you want to operate in the Apple ecosystem, they control how you
breathe and everything has to be exactly like how they want you to do it.</p>
<p>And they have this big fight for our privacy going on, which I appreciate
of course. I love it.  But the end result somehow is that they tripled their
advertising revenue over the past quarter or something like that.</p>
<p>Somehow everyone now has to use their advertising program.  So this is
again, someone trying to control the internet.  And similarly, we all
know the EPIC app store story.  Basically if you want to sell something on an
Apple device, Apple would really like to get their cut, if you used their
technology or not.</p>
<p>So also no love for Apple and Microsoft.</p>
<h3 id="summarizing">Summarizing</h3>
<p>Who actually controls the internet?  Well, we have a bunch of
governments and they make pretty ham-fisted attempts to control the
internet.  And it’s not very effective in many countries.</p>
<p>But at least in democracies, there are courts, there are
lawsuits, there is due process.  It’s not easy for a non authoritarian
government to block content online.  They have to go through all kinds of
motions and is a very visible thing.</p>
<p>Maybe some good news, all these efforts to encrypt ever more of the internet do mean
that less sophisticated or less autonomous governments have an ever a harder time controlling the internet.</p>
<p>So let’s just count that as a win.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we have these big
technology firms, that control the hardware, the software, and they run
their own kangaroo courts that decide who wins and who loses.</p>
<p>And there’s no way to appeal that or to have any insights from what they are doing,
because they are encrypting what they are doing and hiding it from end
users, while simultaneously moving more and more stuff to their control points</p>
<p>This means 1) they have these kangaroo courts and 2) they’re moving more
and more control to these kangaroo courts.</p>
<p>Much as we love to hate on incompetent governments that just don’t get it, and I work for
one, so
I’m well aware of how they don’t get it. Stuff like due process is actually
rather nice.  It is pretty good that if someone wants to kick you off the
internet, that there has to be some kind of process for that and that you
can appeal and that there are standards of evidence. That actually is a
nice thing.</p>
<p>People fought centuries to get that.  And then we moved to the internet.
Then we said, well, we no longer need that.  We can just kick people off the
internet using.  And I mean, an invisible mechanism that no one knows how it
works because, and this is worrying because as it stands more and more
control of the internet is shifting to these unaccountable mega firms,
and personally, that worries me.</p>
<p>And I think with that, we can say that who controls the internet?  Well, evermore of it is controlled by a big opaque
companies.</p>
<p>So is there any hope?  There are no easy solutions.  Privacy is good.
Encryption is good.  End to end Encryption is good.  Making information
freely available is good, but neither governments or companies are
protecting these interests well enough right now</p>
<p>Maybe the one thing we could concretely demand is that players with such
significant market power do better than the current kangaroo courts that
they are running right now, because due process really is a lovely thing.
Especially if there are decisions that can just look you out of your life or
ruin your company.</p>
<p>And with that, we have reached the end of my presentation but I will be
around afterwards for a Q and A.  I’m happy to answer any of your questions
there.  And if not, then please feel free to send me an email or find me on
Twitter because I’d love to hear your thoughts and to make sure that I
really upset everyone.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
