    <h1>Tell HN: YouTube download websites disappearing from Google search results</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey HN community, I&#39;ve noticed an intriguing shift in Google search results lately. As someone who often shares comedy videos with friends via WhatsApp, I typically search for &#34;YouTube Download&#34; on Google and click on one of the first few results. However, today I was taken aback to find that no working websites appeared in the search.</p><p>Upon further investigation, I discovered that numerous recent DMCA reports have called for the removal of these websites, e.g., (<a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/34141048#" rel="nofollow">https://lumendatabase.org/notices/34141048#</a>) and (<a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/34226349#" rel="nofollow">https://lumendatabase.org/notices/34226349#</a>). Interestingly, this development coincides with YouTube&#39;s ongoing ad-blocker crackdown.</p><p>I donÂ´t agree that those websites necessarily violate copyrighted content. I can&#39;t help but feel that my trust in Google search results has been further eroded.</p></div></div></div>
