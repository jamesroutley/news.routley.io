    <h1>Ask HN: Technical forums that are not dominated by pedantry?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m finding forums like Stack Overflow to be almost unusable due to the sheer number of useless pedantic criticism that people post instead of actually answering questions.</p><p>This usually falls into one of the following:</p><p>1. Nitpickers who interpreted something in your question as incorrect.  They will focus on this minor point that they think you said.</p><p>2. Dogmatists who consider what you are asking about as violating some sacred creed, like model-view-controller or following a pattern.  They believe that you&#39;ve violated that, and they are going to focus on that.  Nevermind that you&#39;re asking about performance problems with some function, they are going to criticize you for using that function.</p><p>3. Evangelists who think you should be using newer technology Y instead of technology X. You asked a question about configuring something in X, and instead get lots of useless responses telling you to use Y.  It doesn&#39;t matter your reasons for using X. X is stupid, use Y.</p><p>I suspect that if the voting/karma behaviour of these forums could be changed, there would be less of this.</p><p>But are there better forums where this sort of behaviour is discouraged?</p></div></div></div>
