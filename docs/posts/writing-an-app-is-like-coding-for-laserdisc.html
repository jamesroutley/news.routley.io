    <h1>Writing an app is like coding for LaserDisc</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>11 years ago to the day, I was at a tech conference. It was 3 year after the iPhone had launched its app SDK.  Those of us who had been in the mobile game a while had already spent years developing apps for Symbian, BlackBerry, Windows CE, and at least a dozen other OSes which I&#39;ve since scrubbed from my memory.</p><p>But apps were the hip &#34;new&#34; thing, apparently. And there were a lot of people who were passionately invested in the idea the Steve Jobs‚Ñ¢Ô∏è would save us all.</p><p>And, some of us, thought this was bunkum.  With this memorable comparison being made:</p><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/adactio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@adactio</a> &#34;writing an app is like coding for LaserDisc&#34;<a href="https://twitter.com/aral?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Aral</a>: &#34;that&#39;s not fair!&#34;<a href="https://twitter.com/adactio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@adactio</a>: &#34;give it time&#34;</p><p>‚Äî Terence Eden (@edent) <a href="https://twitter.com/edent/status/110664429921771520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2011</a></p></blockquote><p>11 years later, and I think <a href="https://adactio.com/">Jeremy Keith</a> (@adactio) was right.</p><p>For those of you too young to remember, a LaserDisc was like a CD ROM about the size of a vinyl record<sup id="fnref-43544-old"><a href="#fn-43544-old" title="Read footnote.">1</a></sup>.</p><p>The LaserDisc was, I think it is fair to say, <em>not</em> a commercial success. In the 1980s, the BBC built an amazing Doomsday<sup id="fnref-43544-doom"><a href="#fn-43544-doom" title="Read footnote.">2</a></sup> Project on LaserDisc. It had a <a href="https://www.domesday86.com/?page_id=2140#The_National_Disc">prototype version of Street View</a>. But a few years later, there was <a href="https://www.domesday86.com/?page_id=2140#The_National_Disc">no hardware capable of playing the discs</a>.</p><p>The same is true of most modern smartphones. If you wrote an app for an early version of iOS or Android, it simply won&#39;t run on modern hardware or software. APIs have changed, SDKs weren&#39;t designed with forward compatibility, and app store requirements have evolved.</p><p>The web has none of that. The earliest websites are viewable on modern browsers<sup id="fnref-43544-flash"><a href="#fn-43544-flash" title="Read footnote.">3</a></sup>.  Sure, sometimes they might render in unexpected ways. And you might hope the servers they run on have been updated with security patches. But a website from the 1990s still works three decades later.</p><p>An app released a single decade ago is unlikely to run.</p><p>Even if the OS had a compatibility mode, it still requires the developer to stay up to date with all the various changes to app store policies. App stores are a gatekeeper.</p><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/adactio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@adactio</a> gets it spot on at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/update2011?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#update2011</a> - app stores are for people who want to turn back the clock to a permission base publication model.</p><p>‚Äî Terence Eden (@edent) <a href="https://twitter.com/edent/status/110659893987524608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2011</a></p></blockquote><p>The web doesn&#39;t have gatekeepers<sup id="fnref-43544-gatekeepers"><a href="#fn-43544-gatekeepers" title="Read footnote.">4</a></sup>. If you pay for your domain and hosting, your site will be viewable.</p><p>Of course, there are still some things which the web can&#39;t do. And there are some things where users prefer an in-app experience rather than tabbing through a browser.</p><p>And, of course, conferences are for big discussions rather than subtle nuance!</p><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Native vs Web debates are good for a laff (a la <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/update2011?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#update2011</a>), but the real question is when should I use which?</p><p>‚Äî Algorithms R Us (@mahemoff) <a href="https://twitter.com/mahemoff/status/110670289356079105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2011</a></p></blockquote><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don&#39;t have time for militant web devs anymore that I have time for militant native devs. The right tool for the job at hand. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/update2011?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#update2011</a></p><p>‚Äî üåà Michael (he/him) (@maybe_social) <a href="https://twitter.com/maybe_social/status/110682247287406592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2011</a></p></blockquote><p>It&#39;s worth having a look through <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/update2011?src=hashtag_click">all the Tweets from the day</a>. I&#39;m sure some people have long since deleted their messages or accounts. But there&#39;s still a treasure-trove of wisdom from when we were all much younger and much more self-confident.</p><p>I particularly like <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/fizzkitten/4599372038/">this snarky video from Relly Annett-Baker</a>:</p><p>Ironically, many of the web links are now dead. But they&#39;ve mostly been captured by the Internet Archive to be enjoyed for many years to come.</p><p>I wonder whether apps will become part of a digital dark ages which are lost to the future?</p></div></div>
