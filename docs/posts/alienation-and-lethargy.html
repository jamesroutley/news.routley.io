    <h1>Alienation and lethargy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><p>I haven&#39;t been doing great lately.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been thinking about writing a 2025 year-in-review post, but here we are in February, already
1/12 of the way through 2026. Time is both crawling past and blisteringly fast. In short, 2025 was
good in some ways, devestating in others. At the end of the year I went on a beautiful trip to
Vermont with family. Around the same time, my house developed two major leaks, one of which requires
replacing our roof to the tune of $20k.<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup><span>Did you know you can donate to <a href="https://ko-fi.com/fauxtrots">my KoFi</a>?</span> I&#39;ve been unemployed for over a year now, outside of
some minor gig work.<sup><a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#footnote-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup><span>Feel free to also <a href="mailto:hello@fauxtrots.com">reach out</a> with job opportunities!</span></p>
<p>Despite all of this free time, I&#39;ve been finding it difficult to get anything done. I&#39;m lethargic
but jittery, finding it difficult to avoid switching between tabs (literal and metaphorical) every
five seconds. About the only thing I&#39;ve been able to focus on in the past month has been <em>Hollow
Knight: Silksong</em>, having put in around 70 hours so far with more game left to play.</p>

<p>The reasons I&#39;m feeling this way aren&#39;t anything too surprising. I&#39;ve had depression for years, and
while meds help, there&#39;s only so much they can do, especially when the underlying issues are all too
real. There&#39;s a fascist government in power, and trans people are one of their major targets. Goons
are disappearing people and killing them in the streets. More and more proof keeps being released
showing that there really is a small group of pedophilic elites with outsized effects on culture and
politics. On a smaller, more local level, the cold front and snowstorms washing across the eastern
US have been making it unpleasant to go outside or do anything. None of these problems are within my
individual power to solve, and while the scenes of solidarity and resistance occuring in Minneapolis
and elsewhere warm my heart, I feel powerless to do anything myself. I believe that all of these
conditions will end eventually, but none are pleasant to live through.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really have a conclusion to this. Shit sucks. I&#39;m going to turn it around on you instead,
dear reader. What do you do when doing anything feels impossible?</p>
