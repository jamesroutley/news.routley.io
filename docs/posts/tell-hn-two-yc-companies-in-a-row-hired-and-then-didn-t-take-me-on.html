    <h1>Tell HN: Two YC companies in a row hired and then didn&#39;t take me on</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m a senior iOS developer with background at a FAANG etc, so during good times it was always very easy to find jobs. Recently I&#39;ve had some pretty bad experiences with two YC companies in a row.</p><p>In both cases I went through long recruitment processes, spoke at length with the founders and technical staff, did a (paid) trial project, in one case this lasted for almost a month. In both companies everyone I talk to was extremely positive, even gushing, so I was not surprised to be hired.</p><p>I was very surprised though that in both cases they changed their minds before the formal employment had begun, due to their financial situation.</p><p>They were never rude, and they did pay me for the hours I had worked, but it still wasted a lot of my time since I didn&#39;t seek any other jobs while trial working for them.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to imagine that it was some kind of ruse to get very short term work done, but it&#39;s also hard to see how they couldn&#39;t plan better. Perhaps they started hiring on the expectation of being able to raise money, but that seems unprofessional and disrespectful towards the candidates, no?</p></div></div></div>
