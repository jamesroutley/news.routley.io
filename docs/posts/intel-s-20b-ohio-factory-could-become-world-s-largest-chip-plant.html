That could grow to $100 billion with eight total fabrication plants and would be the largest investment on record in Ohio, he told Reuters.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">Dubbed the silicon heartland, it could become &#34;the largest semiconductor manufacturing location on the planet,&#34; he said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">While chipmakers are scrambling to boost output, Intel&#39;s plans for new factories will not alleviate the current supply crunch, because such complexes take years to build.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Gelsinger reiterated on Friday he expected the chip shortages to persist into 2023.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">To dramatically increase chip production in the United States, the Biden administration aims to persuade Congress to approve $52 billion in subsidy funding. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/us-lawmakers-urge-speedy-action-us-semiconductor-chips-funding-2021-10-21/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Friday the House of Representatives would soon introduce a bill on competitiveness to help bolster semiconductor investment and supply chains. That would include the $52 billion <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pelosi-says-us-house-will-soon-introduce-competitiveness-bill-2022-01-21" target="_blank">funding</a>.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">U.S. President Joe Biden touted Intel&#39;s investment on Friday at a White House event with Gelsinger and again made the case for congressional action.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">&#34;China is doing everything it can to take over the global market so they can try to out compete the rest of us,&#34; Biden said.</p><figure data-testid="image-0"><div><div></div></div><figcaption>The Intel Corporation logo is seen on a display in a store in Manhattan, New York City, November 24, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly</figcaption></figure><p data-testid="paragraph-10">U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said at the event the current semiconductor supply chain is &#34;far too dependent on conditions and countries halfway around the world.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">Gelsinger said without government funding &#34;we&#39;re still going to start the Ohio site. It&#39;s just not going to happen as fast and it&#39;s not going to grow as big as quickly.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">THE CHIP FEAST AND FAMINE</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">Intel ceded the No. 1 semiconductor vendor spot to Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/005930.KS" target="_blank">(005930.KS)</a> in 2021, dropping to second with growth of just 0.5%, the lowest rate in the top 25, data from Gartner showed.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">As part of its turnaround plan to become a major manufacturer of chips for outside customers, Intel broke ground on two factories in Arizona in September. The $20 billion plants will bring the total number of Intel factories at its campus in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler to six. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-breaks-ground-20-bln-arizona-plants-us-chip-factory-race-heats-up-2021-09-24/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-15">Gelsinger told Reuters he still hoped to announce another major manufacturing site in Europe in coming months.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-16">It is not just Intel ramping up investments. Rivals Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co or TSMC also have announced big investment plans in the U.S. And that&#39;s raising questions about a glut in chips going forward.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-17">&#34;We still have years in front of us before we&#39;re even having a semblance of supply demand balance,&#34; said Gelsinger. &#34;Ask yourself what portion of your life is not becoming more digital.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-18">&#34;Yes, the industry is growing, and maybe the metaverse solves world hunger for the semiconductor industry. But there is a big bubble coming,&#34; said Alan Priestley, an analyst at Gartner.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-19">Intel&#39;s Ohio investment is expected to attract partners and suppliers.
