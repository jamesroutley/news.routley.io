    <h1>Meshtastic!</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!----><p>I went to a mesh networking workshop over the weekend at <a href="https://iffybooks.net">Iffy Books</a><sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup><span>They&#39;re an awesome leftist hacker bookstore here in Philly, definitely worth checking out if
    you&#39;re in the area, or <a href="https://iffybooks.net/donate/">supporting financially</a> so they can stick
    around.</span> and
had a great time! We all had/bought these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa</a><sup><a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#footnote-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup><span>Short for Long Range. LoRa is a (proprietary) mesh networking radio communication technology.</span> devices
that we needed to set up. We flashed them with <a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> firmware and
went through the process of setting it all up. It was my first real experience with non-web
networking and it&#39;s already helping me imagine what else is possible.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still ironing out the kinks with it for the moment. I want to put it high up in the house so
that it can (hopefully) transmit over more range, but the top floor of my rowhome is my bedroom, the
circuit board has several flashing lights, and the included case is not opaque. Right now it just
has a shirt thrown over it, but I&#39;d like to find a better solution to prevent the lights keeping me
up. It might come down to electrical tape or just buying a better case, but we&#39;ll see. I&#39;m also
running into a bug where I can&#39;t connect to it over bluetooth with the
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geeksville.mesh&amp;hl=en_US">app</a>, but after some
github snooping it seems like this is a known issue, so maybe I&#39;ll be able to find a solution.</p>
<p>After the workshop was over I felt inspired and bought a bunch more electronics for various
projects, hopefully some of which will grace these digital pages soon! I&#39;ve had a couple blog posts
simmering away recently so I think I&#39;m due for more activity here.</p>
