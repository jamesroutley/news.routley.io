    <p>5 June, 2023</p>
    <p>My relationship to programming and technical work has made a radical shift since I completed my batch at <a href="https://www.recurse.com">the Recurse Center</a>. Programming has gone from a “because my brain wants to” activity to a full-time job, seemingly overnight. In this post, I’ll discuss some of the recent developments in my career shift, and how my relationship to my technical work both on and off the job is evolving.</p>
<p>I’ve written extensively on this blog about my <a href="https://datum-b.com/blog/quitting_unhappiness">dissatisfaction with my previous role</a> and my <a href="https://datum-b.com/blog/we_need_to_go_deeper">desires for my future career</a>. In summary, I was stuck in a lower-management role masquerading as a technical leadership role, and this did not align well with my technical interests or long-term career goals. I had been spending nearly all of my free time outside of work learning programming and working on personal projects. I had carved out a couple of programming tasks for myself within the day job, tasks which I objectively should have delegated, but truly were the only things keeping me sane.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://datum-b.com/blog/a_strategic_retreat">time at the Recurse Center</a> served as an inflection point in my journey. While I have not fully reflected on what I accomplished there and what the experience meant to me, what’s equally important is what I didn’t do: work at or even think about my regular job. This made for a clean break from my last role, of which I had been having trouble fully letting go. My complete lack of availability allowed my successor to fully take over the leadership aspect, and when I returned it was to an almost completely blank slate.</p>
<h2 id="one-to-many">One to Many</h2>
<p>One feature of my new working arrangement is that I have somewhere between 3 and 5 tasks, depending on how you count. In the long-term I prefer to only work one thing at a time, but in the near-term I’m foregoing this desire so that I can hone my skills in as many ways as possible.</p>
<p>When I was a young mechanical engineer, I was in the group charged with building ground support equipment. These jobs would often be cradle-to-grave type tasks, everything from figuring out what was needed, generating concepts, designing, drafting, chasing parts through the shop, building, testing, and then becoming an end-user of the final product. What’s important here is that I performed this cycle dozens of times, while my peers who were charged with building flight hardware maybe only went through that cycle once or twice in the same time period. At last count, I had been responsible for or somehow involved in over 60 deliveries in a four-year period. This repetition of the design cycle helped me to master these skills quickly, and gave me the chance to optimize and improve my process on the next iteration.</p>
<p>I am undertaking my development as a software engineer with the same strategy: do it a lot, and do it quickly. Work on a lot of projects, and look for parallels between them. Working on just one project risks me only using a limited set of tools; working on many forces me to use and improve upon a wider breadth of knowledge. This project has a deep and complex data pipeline to master; this project is IO-bound and benefits from multi-threading; this one is process bound and benefits from parallel processing. Let’s do them all.</p>
<h2 id="company-of-one">Company of One</h2>
<p>The shift in my career hasn’t only been from hardware to software. In my previous role, I was ultimately a conduit and a weak filter for a multitude of competing interests. There were few decisions that I could make independently that wouldn’t be vetted and questioned by an army of managers, external stakeholders, and subject matter experts. To be fair, this is a proven way to make sure that something that Absolutely Must Work is going to work, but it’s not how I want to spend my career.</p>
<p>One of my biggest inspirations for taking the career turn I’ve taken is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37570605-company-of-one">Company of One</a> by Paul Jarvis. On the surface, this book is about being a technical consultant or being fully self-employed. But Jarvis argues in the book that companies of one can exist within the structure of a larger organization.</p>
<p>In my new set of roles, I’m mostly autonomous. While my work can still have far-ranging impacts, I’m reporting directly to individual customers and stakeholders, and most technical decisions are mine to make. My success is now pinned directly to my customer’s happiness, and the parallels to independent consulting work are obvious. The ownership and responsibility that I feel towards my work has increased tremendously, as has my own happiness and sense of purpose.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for me to have entire days without meetings, and it’s rare that I get more than a couple of emails in a day that require a response. The most important meetings are one-on-one talks with my customers about how my products are working for them, and what they need me to focus on next.</p>
<p>Networking within my organization has become an activity I take seriously in order to garner more work for myself. There is no near-term financial incentive to do so, as I’m on a fixed salary, nor am I struggling to find tasks to fill my time. My reason for continually seeking out new clients &amp; applications is this: the more people who use my work, the more feedback I’ll get, the more I’ll learn, the more technically proficient I’ll become, the better my products will get, which means more people will hear about and ask for my services. It’s my version of <a href="https://www.jimcollins.com/concepts/the-flywheel.html">Jim Collins’ Flywheel</a>, and I can already see it picking up momentum.</p>
<h2 id="push-to-master">Push to Master</h2>
<p>It’s been more than two months since I returned to my regular job, and I’m still adjusting to the new normal. I used to do programming as a means of silent rebellion against a job that didn’t suit me. Like a dissatisfied spouse seeking a more vibrant lover, I would stretch my technical capability in ways that my day job just wouldn’t do for me.</p>
<p>Now programming is my primary activity at work, and I don’t know how my technical passions should fit within my personal life. While I’m able to learn new skills on the job, these aren’t everything I want to do. Embedded Rust calls my name, and I just can’t find the mental bandwidth to take it on. I either take work home with me and keep pushing to finish a feature throughout a long weekend, or I leave it alone and don’t do much of anything. It’s a balance I’ve yet to properly strike.</p>
<p>“To achieve autonomy as a company of one, you have to be a master at your core skill set,” writes Jarvis. As the dust settles from making a bold career move earlier this year, the next moves in the long game are beginning to come into focus.</p>
