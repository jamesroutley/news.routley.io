            <h3>Is Docker sunsetting the Free Team plan?</h3>
            <p>No. Docker communicated its intent to sunset the Docker Free Team plan on March 14, 2023, but <b>this decision was reversed on March 24, 2023.</b></p> 
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>Does Docker still have an Open Source program?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Our long-standing <a href="https://www.docker.com/community/open-source/application/">Docker-Sponsored Open Source program</a> was never affected by the (now-reversed) sunsetting of Free Team plans, and continues to be available. We recommend eligible projects apply to this program, as it offers benefits that exceed those of the Free Team plan.</p> 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How do I know if I’m using the Docker Free Team plan?</h3>
            <p>Please consult the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/orgs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Organizations page</a> of your Docker account: organizations using the Free Team plan are labeled “Docker Free Team” in the “Subscription” column. Less than 2% of Docker users have a Free Team organization on their account.</p> 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Why is Docker Free Team not on the pricing page right now?</h3>
            <p>We removed this plan as a signup option in 2021.</p> 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What’s the difference between the (paid) Docker Team plan and the Docker Free Team plan?</h3>
            <p>The main advantages of (paid) Docker Team vs. Docker Free Team are:</p> 
           
            <ul>
                <li aria-level="1">Unlimited number of teams (vs. 1 team in Free Team)</li>
                <li aria-level="1">Up to 100 seats total (vs. 3 seats max in Free Team)</li>
                <li aria-level="1">Unlimited private repositories (vs. no private repositories included in Free Team)</li>
                <li aria-level="1">5,000 pulls/day/user (vs. 200 pulls/6 hours/user in Free Team)</li>
                <li aria-level="1"><b>The Free Team plan does not </b><a href="https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq/#subscriptionandlicensing"><b>include a license for commercial use of Docker Desktop</b></a><b> at a company of more than 250 employees OR more than $10 million in annual revenue.</b></li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>What if I requested a migration from Docker Free Team to Docker Personal or Docker Pro?</h3>
            <p>We will not migrate your account, as you can now continue to use your current Free Team organization. Our support team will respond to all open inquiries to confirm this.</p> 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>I upgraded from Docker Free Team to a paid plan between March 14 and March 24, when will I receive my refund?</h3>
            <p>We are working to identify and refund all such transactions that happened between our announcements on March 14 and March 24. Please allow up to 30 days to receive your refund.</p> 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>I upgraded from Docker Free Team to a paid plan, but I’m having issues reverting to Free Team.</h3>
            <p>Please <a href="https://hub.docker.com/support/contact/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">contact support</a>.</p> 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Can I export the data from my account?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you may pull images from your private repositories on the Docker registry and push those images to another registry of your choosing.</p> 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Is Docker removing any public images or layers?</h3>
            <p>No. At no point did Docker intend to delete, or in any way limit access to public repositories. No action is required for open source project maintainers. Public images or layers only disappear from Docker Hub if the maintainer of the repository decides to delete them from Docker Hub.</p> 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Can someone else “squat” namespaces?</h3>
            <p>No. Docker did not release namespaces, so users were never at risk of having namespaces &#34;squatted.&#34;</p> 
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Did this impact the security of content on Docker Hub?</h3>
            <p>No. At no point did Docker restrict access to public repositories. Maintainers have been able to update their repositories without interruption, and continue to have full access to their repositories for any purpose, such as remediating CVEs.</p>
