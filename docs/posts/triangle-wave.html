          <section><p>I was just thinking, oh, yeah, the triangle wave is one of the basic waves, so the equation for it is probably fairly obvious with a mod somewhere in it.</p>
<p>So, I tried to work it out in notebook and couldn’t get it. I did not know how to make the “V” repeat.

<p><img src="http://jimkang.com/weblog/articles/triangle-wave/triangle-wave-notebook.jpg" alt="Graph of a triangle wave in a notebook, equation that&#39;s not right."/></p>
<p>So, I looked it up, and it is indeed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_wave">fairly busy</a>. I saw that equation and was like, how does this relate to anything?</p>
<p>But it turns out that, if you <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1plwcl22bj">start with a straight line and successively add components</a>, though, you can see where all of the parts come from. (Except for that 4. Please let me know if you know!)</p>


<p><a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1plwcl22bj">Here’s a link to the graph with the notes so you can make sense of the successive equations.</a></p>
<hr/>
<p>Desmos is so nice, <span>BTW</span>. You just write equations and get them graphed. It’s helped me think through a lot of things. When I was making <a href="https://jimkang.com/sound-of-the-far-future/">Sound of the Far Future</a>, I used it work through ways of <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/soff/blob/main/flows/ticker.js#L60">controlling tempo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jimkang/soff/blob/main/tools/add-eased-time.js#L27">timing when events were announced</a>. I hope it never gets crapped up by business.</p>
