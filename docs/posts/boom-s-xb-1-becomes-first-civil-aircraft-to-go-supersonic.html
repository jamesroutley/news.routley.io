    <h1>Boom&#39;s XB-1 becomes first civil aircraft to go supersonic</h1>

<p id="speakable-summary">Boom Supersonic’s XB-1 demonstrator plane just went supersonic in the skies over California’s Mojave desert, making it the first civil aircraft to break the sound barrier. </p>

<p>The American startup’s plane notched the historic achievement in its twelfth test flight. It cleared Mach 1 and stayed supersonic for around four minutes, reaching Mach 1.1. Test pilot Tristan Brandenburg broke the sound barrier two more times before receiving the call to bring the XB-1 back to the Mojave Air &amp; Space Port. </p>







<p>The supersonic flight comes eight years after Boom first revealed the XB-1. It’s a small, roughly one-third scale version of the 64-passenger airliner Boom eventually wants to build, which it calls <a href="https://boomsupersonic.com/overture" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Overture</a>. </p>

<p>Boom CEO Blake Scholl wrote in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://x.com/bscholl/status/1883218539412345178">post</a> on X over the weekend that “[m]uch work remains to scale up to Overture.” That includes firing up the Overture’s engine for the first time, which Boom hopes to do later this year. </p>

<p>If and when the company can build it, Overture already has customers in waiting: American, and Japan Airlines have all placed orders for the proposed supersonic aircraft.</p>

<p>Brandenburg landed the XB-1 safely just before 12PM ET. Boom has said that a second supersonic test flight could happen in the next week or two.  </p>

<p>“[T]his is supersonic flight’s ‘Falcon 1’ moment,” Scholl wrote over the weekend, referring to when SpaceX’s first rocket reached orbit in 2008. </p>


<p>Scholl added that “XB-1’s supersonic flight marks the first time a supersonic jet has come from something other than a nation-state.” The Concorde, which was retired in 2003, was built jointly by the British and French governments.</p>

<p>Ahead of the flight, Scholl spoke with TechCrunch editor-in-chief Connie Loizos for <a rel="nofollow" href="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=YFL1631161608">the StrictlyVC Download podcast</a>. </p>



<p>“I think the thing we need is a rebirth of entrepreneurship in commercial aviation,” he said. “We need more Booms, frankly. We need more companies with great ideas finding new ways to push the envelope.”</p>







<p>There are a number of other companies working on supersonic aircraft, though many of them are focused on defense applications. One of the only others working on supersonic aviation for the commercial space — Exosonic — <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/08/supersonic-aircraft-startup-exosonic-is-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down</a> in November. </p>

<p>Scholl said in the interview that Boom being essentially the only startup working on commercial supersonic aircraft has been “honestly a little lonely.” </p>

<p>But Scholl said he’s glad Boom has been primarily focused on commercial over defense, even though military tech is, well, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/led-by-anduril-defense-tech-funding-sets-a-new-record-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">booming</a>. </p>

<p>“I’m glad there are weapons startups, they should definitely exist,” Scholl said. “But if you’re building, you know, effectively a hypersonic weapon, it’s extremely different from something that you and I are going to get to fly on, and that’s really a very distinct effort that I think really deserves to exist.” </p>

<p>Boom is doing some work with the U.S. Air Force, but Scholl said his focus remains on making supersonic passenger travel a reality again.</p>

<p>“This is about American jobs, this is about American leadership in aviation, this is about building the future, this is about improving human connectivity across cultures,” he said. “I think there’s frankly a lot for everybody to get excited about here.”</p>
