<p>It’s never been so easy to create incredibly polished mockups — from design software upgrades to AI assistants, we’re seeing usable user interfaces come to life in seconds.</p>

<p>But there are some major business risks in this approach. They can burn you even if you’re a team who makes time for user research.</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>The aesthetic-usability effect</em> — People perceive more aesthetically pleasing interfaces as more intuitive or usable (whether they are or not). User research participants will pick the prettiest option, or tell you they love a beautiful mockup even if it’s difficult or low-value.</li>
  <li><em>Parkinson’s law of triviality</em> — People get overwhelmed by big decisions, and so they spend disproportionate time on small ones. User research participants (and designers) love to focus on fun elements like colors and interactions, and don’t get around to the larger questions of why and when the product is needed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Look at <a href="https://maybe.co/">Maybe</a>, a gorgeous financial services dashboard that <a href="https://twitter.com/Shpigford/status/1645422615279050758">announced a big pivot today</a> because “six weeks after launch, we only had 50 paying customers, out of a waiting list of 10,000+ people.”</p>

<p>So. If you’re designing a new product or service, give it the Craigslist test — start with low-fidelity options that see if people would love it even if it looked like Craigslist.</p>

<p>Low-fidelity (shown in my UX sketching kit image above) means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>NO: styling, photographs, illustrations, colors, or fonts (besides a default one)</li>
  <li>YES: real text (not lorem ipsum), symbolic images, and symbolic UI</li>
</ul>

<p>Focus on content and functionality when you’re designing new products; that’s the validation that will build a business.</p>
