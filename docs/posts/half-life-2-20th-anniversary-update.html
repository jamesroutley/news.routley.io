                    <p><a href="https://half-life.com/halflife25">Our Half-Life 1 25th anniversary documentary</a> went so well that we invited <a href="https://www.secrettape.video/">Secret Tape</a> back to make another one—this time focusing on Half-Life 2. And it&#39;s about a lot more than just the making of a game. Running out of money. Getting hacked, and an early version being leaked online. Being sued by our publisher. Trying to build Steam. It&#39;s all in there!</p>

                    <h3>Updated Game Content</h3>
                    <p>Every map in Half-Life 2 has been looked over by Valve level designers to fix longstanding bugs, restore content and features lost to time, and improve the quality of a few things like lightmap resolution and fog:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed pops, holes in the world, fading-out and disappearing objects across the game.</li>
						<li>Rebalanced the lighting across Half-Life 2 to account for playing with HDR on or off, using the original release as reference.</li>
						<li>Cleaner, smoother horizon lines thanks to new radial fog!</li>
						<li>Added higher-resolution lightmaps across the game!</li>
						<li>Removed green glow from the G-Man model’s eyes in the opening of the game, and restored the reflective glint as seen in the original release.</li>
						<li>Fixed missing grass sprites and blacked-out models throughout the game!</li>
					</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>Gamepad controls have been updated to match the Half-Life 1 anniversary update.</li>
						<li>Aim Assistance has gotten an overhaul making it feel better to use, and there are more configuration options available. Aim Assistance can be enabled separately for gamepad or mouse/keyboard input. The amount of assistance can be tuned up and down, and it’s no longer tied to a skill setting. Want to play on Hard with high aim assist, or Easy with it off? Knock yourself out.</li>
						<li>The Steam Deck main menu has been updated with all of today’s additions including the Episodes, Workshop, and new input configuration. The Steam Deck version of the main menu will also appear when you play Half-Life 2 on a PC running Big Picture Mode.</li>
