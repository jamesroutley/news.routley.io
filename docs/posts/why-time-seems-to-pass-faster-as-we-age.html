<p>1/ I’ve been mega-obsessed with this feeling.</p>



<p>A year as a 36-year-old seems so much shorter as compared to when I was a kid or even as a teen.</p>



<p>It seems cosmically unfair – <strong>we have fewer years to live, and each year flies by faster.</strong></p>



<p>2/ But, why is that happening?</p>



<p>My tentative conclusion is that <strong>it’s an unfortunate outcome of how evolution shaped our brain to be an efficient storage device. </strong></p>



<p>3/ Our brain is a prediction device.</p>



<p>Its top job is to <strong>construct a model of the world so that we get a survival and reproductive edge. </strong></p>



<p>4/ To be able to predict a phenomenon is to be able to control it and have power over it, so <strong>our brain is obsessed with predicting how things are going to go.</strong></p>



<p>It wants to be able to predict how mates are found, how money is made, what makes people laugh, and so on.. <sup></sup></p>



<p>5/ But it’s also efficient.</p>



<p>If an event has happened before, what’s the point of paying attention to it and storing it in memory?</p>



<p>Redundant storage is inefficient, so the b<strong>rain likely only pays attention to and memorises what’s new and surprising. </strong></p>



<p>6/ As kids, everything is new and surprising.</p>



<p><strong>The world is full of learning opportunities, so the brain makes massive updates in memories.</strong></p>



<p>Full snapshots of your birthdays, vacations, days at school and so on. <sup></sup></p>



<p>7/ <strong>Surprising information comes in droves every single day, so the brain simply paid a lot of attention</strong>, and hence you felt there were so-many-slices-of-time in a day.</p>



<p>It also stored that rich information in memory, so even looking back, days felt longer. </p>



<p>8/ <strong>As we grow, new surprises become a merely tiny-patch on an old memory.</strong></p>



<p>Why store the full details of your N-th vacation when you can simply store the diff of it from your first one? <sup></sup></p>



<p>9/ In other words, as we age, our memories and attention become low-fidelity versions of their former self.</p>



<p><strong>As patterns in life start repeating themselves, the slices-of-time that you notice and memorise become fewer and coarser. </strong></p>



<p>10/ Naturally, <strong>if anyone asks where did time in your life go, you’d access your memory and find the majority of them relating to childhood</strong>, and very few from the recent times.</p>



<p>And that’s why time feels like it accumulated in the past, and not in the recent present. <sup></sup></p>



<p>11/ The main culprit in time-speeding up is predictability.</p>



<p><strong>The more predictable your days are, the shorter they will feel. </strong></p>



<p>12/ A thought experiment.</p>



<p>If you have a stable job, you can pretty much mentally time travel a full year and find your days to be similar.</p>



<p><strong>But if I ask you to imagine doing a PhD in Sanskrit at a foreign university, you would have no idea what your days are going to look like. </strong></p>



<p>13/ So, <strong>predictability not just impacts perception of time in the present but also for the future.</strong></p>



<p>As kids, a vacation was full of surprising information, so it actually felt rich and long.</p>



<p>Now, your nth trip to Goa feels much shorter as you know what you’re going to do. <sup></sup></p>



<p>14/ So, what to do? How to slow down time?</p>



<p><strong>The only approach I can think of is to break the predictability and actively plan to be (massively) surprised.</strong></p>



<p>Take on projects that you have no idea about. <sup></sup></p>



<p>15/ <strong>Unfortunately, we are evolved to avoid exploring and taking risks as we age.</strong></p>



<p>Our brain pushes us to exploit more of the world we have come to understand better instead of pushing us to explore more.</p>



<p>But that’s precisely how you’ll make your years fly. <sup></sup></p>



<p>16/ You need to ask yourself.</p>



<p>How do you want to answer how you lived your life?</p>



<p><strong>Long one, or the one that *feels* long?</strong></p>



<p>What’s more important to you?</p>



<p>17/ Interestingly, <strong>the solution to slowing down time is not boredom</strong> (as I thought). </p>



<p>Boredom is a negative state. The solution is to dive head-first into unknown territory. </p>



<p><strong>That is, to travel physically or mentally,</strong></p>



<p>18/ Note that <strong>we’re really good at grokking patterns / making predictive models. </strong></p>



<p>As soon as we figure out a winning condition for a game or the story plot, we lose interest in it.</p>



<p>19/ So <strong>an existential crisis is a spoiler alert for life. </strong></p>



<p>The brain with all its predictive models asks: is this all to life? </p>



<p>But it’s mistaken – <strong>it’s all only to the life that it has chosen to live.</strong></p>



<p>20/ A (radically) different life that it can’t predict will keep brain at its toes. </p>



<p>The key word here is “radically”. </p>



<p><strong>The smaller the change, the less memorable the time.</strong></p>
