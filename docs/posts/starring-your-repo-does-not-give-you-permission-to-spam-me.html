          <p dir="auto">I starred this repo a while ago after reading about it on HN. A couple of days after that, I received a &#34;personalized&#34; email from <a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/joelgriffith/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/joelgriffith">@joelgriffith</a> (though it was obviously automated), telling me that he&#39;s &#34;noticed&#34; I starred the repo, and trying to push me further down whatever growth hacking funnel you&#39;ve set up for yourselves. I figured, okay, sure, the guy is hustling, and hustling is tough.</p>
<p dir="auto">Today I received a second email, reminding me that I didn&#39;t answer the first one. I would have clicked the unsubscribe link, but one wasn&#39;t included, so I went ahead and reported <em>both</em> emails as spam.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please take me off your list.</p>
