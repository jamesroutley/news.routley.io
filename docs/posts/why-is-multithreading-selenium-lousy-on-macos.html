    <h1>Why is multithreading Selenium lousy on MacOS?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="observablehq-main">

<p>This blog post might be the start of a series, depending on how much bandwidth I have to investigate this further...</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working on a new data problem that has necessitated using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/selenium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selenium</a> to extract information expediently. To further speed up the process because I&#39;m impatient as hell, I decided to utilize the <code>ThreadPoolExecutor</code> from the  <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>concurrent.futures</code></a> in my python script to spin up a bunch of Chrome instances like this:</p>
<pre data-language="python"><code><span>def</span> <span>setup_driver</span>():
    chrome_options = Options()
    chrome_options.add_argument(<span>&#34;--headless=new&#34;</span>)
    chrome_options.add_argument(<span>&#34;--disable-gpu&#34;</span>)
    chrome_options.add_argument(<span>&#34;--no-sandbox&#34;</span>)
    chrome_options.add_argument(<span>&#34;--disable-dev-shm-usage&#34;</span>)
    chrome_options.add_argument(<span>&#34;--window-size=1920,1080&#34;</span>)
    <span>return</span> webdriver.Chrome(options=chrome_options)
    
<span>def</span> <span>search_range</span>(<span>range_tuple</span>):
    start_num, end_num, thread_num = range_tuple
    driver = setup_driver()
    
    
    
<span>def</span> <span>main</span>():
    start_entry = <span>0000</span>
    end_entry = <span>5000</span>
    max_threads = <span>10</span>
    chunk_size = (end_entry- start_entry) // max_threads

    ranges = []
    <span>for</span> i <span>in</span> <span>range</span>(max_threads):
        range_start = start_entry + (i * chunk_size)
        range_end = range_start + chunk_size - <span>1</span> <span>if</span> i &lt; max_threads <span>else</span> end_entry
        ranges.append((range_start, range_end, i))

    <span>with</span> ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_threads) <span>as</span> executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(search_range, range_) <span>for</span> range_ <span>in</span> ranges]
        <span>for</span> future <span>in</span> futures:
            <span>try</span>:
                future.result()
            <span>except</span> Exception <span>as</span> e:
                <span>print</span>(<span>f&#34;Thread crashed with error: <span>{<span>str</span>(e)}</span>&#34;</span>)
                traceback.print_exc()

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>chrome_options</code> specified are mainly to optimize performance since I am running it headless.</p>
<p>I have two machines with similar(ish, though now I&#39;m doubting this) specs and bought around the same time in 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 10th Gen - 32 gb RAM (running Ubuntu)</li>
<li>Macbook Pro - Apple M1 Pro - 32 gb RAM</li>
</ul>
<p>The M1 performance with the above code was <em>terrible</em> (I think it&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve really heard my fans spin up). Inspecting the performance in <a href="https://htop.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">htop</a> was practically bewildering, especially when I then looked at the Thinkpad running the exact same script.</p>

<h2 id="interesting-observations" tabindex="-1"><a href="#interesting-observations">Interesting Observations</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>From the start, the number of tasks on Linux is ~1/5th of macOs.</li>
<li>On macOS the CPU usage on all my cores shot up to 100% almost immediately after the script started running.</li>
<li>Linux seems to never show a count for <code>running</code> processes (though the script is obviously running, and I could see many Chrome processes listed in htop). On macOS this consistently showed up at <code>10</code> while I was running the script.</li>
<li>the <code>Load average</code> was also substantially higher on macOS vs Linux</li>
<li>The memory usage on MacOS was also more than 2x that of Linux</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-steps" tabindex="-1"><a href="#next-steps">Next Steps?</a></h2>
<p>I don&#39;t have time to dig into this right now, but if I manage to revisit it, I think the first step would be to try replicating the results in containers. It looks like there&#39;s actually a macOS VM via <a href="https://github.com/sickcodes/Docker-OSX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker-OSX</a>, so that might be a good place to start. A bit of googling also revealed <a href="https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/issues/1601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this issue</a>, but seeing as it was resolved over 2 years ago, I doubt this is still the problem.</p>
<p>For now I&#39;d say, proceed with caution if you&#39;re going to try multithreading with Selenium on a Mac M1 (or use the opportunity to warm your lap in the dead of winter).</p>
