    <h1>Stripe increases fees for EU and UK-based businesses in April</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-prop-key="answer">
    

<p>Starting 10 April, 2023 fees for card processing, disputes, and USD currency payouts will be higher due to increases in network costs (in recent years, major card networks have introduced several new fees and increased existing fees), as well as increases in underlying service costs.</p>
<p>Please refer to the following details to understand how these changes may impact your business.</p>
<h2><strong>Pricing updates by region</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Are there lower cost alternatives to cards?</strong></h2>
<p>If you are using Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/payments/checkout" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><u>Checkout</u></span></a> or the <a href="https://stripe.com/payments/elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><u>Payment Element</u></span></a>, you can easily <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><u>turn on over 25 payment methods</u></span></a> from the Dashboard with zero additional engineering work. Stripe will automatically surface the right payment method to help you increase conversion based on where your user is located.</p>
<p>Below are a few commonly used low cost payment methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://stripe.com/link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><strong><u>Link</u></strong></span></a>, Stripe’s one-click checkout experience, can be used to process all domestic cards for <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>1.2% + €0.25 per transaction</u></a> (or your local equivalent).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://stripe.com/payments/europe-bank-transfers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><strong><u>Bank transfers</u></strong></span></a> can be used to process large, one-off transactions for <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><u>0.5% per transaction, capped at €5.00</u></span></a> (or your local equivalent).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://stripe.com/payments/sepa-direct-debit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><strong><u>SEPA Direct Debit</u></strong></span></a> can be used for EU-based recurring payments for <a href="https://stripe.com/pricing/local-payment-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><u>€0.35 per transaction</u></span></a> (or your local equivalent).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><strong><u>Bacs Direct Debit</u></strong></span></a> can be used for UK-based recurring payments for <a href="https://stripe.com/en-gb/pricing/local-payment-methods" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><u>1% starting at 20p, capped at £2</u></span></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How can I calculate the impact of these updates to my business?</strong></h2>
<p>The best way to calculate the impact these changes might have to your business is to leverage the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/reports/balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><u>Reports section</u></span></a> of your Stripe Dashboard.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li><p>Go to the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/reports/balance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><u>Reports section</u></span></a> of your Dashboard</p></li>
<li><p>Click on “Download” located at the top right hand of the “Balance change from activity” module</p></li>
<li><p>Export your activity to a .CSV file and ensure that “Card country” is selected as a column</p></li>
<li><p>Review transactions processed by the countries impacted</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Starting 10 April 2023 these types of transactions will be subject to the new fees.</p>
<h2><strong>How will I know if a customer is using a commercial, corporate, or business card?</strong></h2>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, expenses that are not for personal use are typically purchased via a commercial, corporate, or business card. Below are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you sell to businesses, they are most likely purchasing through a commercial, corporate, or business card. It does not matter if the card is issued to an individual at the company.</p></li>
<li><p>Sole proprietors often use a commercial, corporate, or business card to purchase supplies or pay for expenses that pertain to their startup or small business.</p></li>
<li><p>Individuals booking business travel or organizing a corporate activity may often use a commercial, corporate, or business card.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>How does Stripe determine when a card is standard or premium?</strong></h2>
<p>We determine whether a card is standard or premium based on the information available from card networks at point of capture. The accuracy of this mapping is regularly reviewed to ensure the appropriate fee is applied to all card transactions.</p>
<h2><strong>For Connect platforms, how does this affect connected accounts?</strong></h2>
<p>If you use Connect with Standard accounts, we’ve handled the communication for you by letting affected users know about the changes in their card fee. If you use Connect with Custom accounts, you are responsible for any updates to your own pricing in line with these changes, and for communicating with your users.</p>
<h2><strong>Do I need to take action?</strong></h2>
<p>There’s no action necessary for you at this time and the fees will automatically update on 10 April 2023.</p>
<h2><strong>Why did I get this notice?</strong></h2>
<p>This support page provides you with more details on the notice we sent you describing changes to certain fees. That notice is a legal notice sent to Stripe users, even those who have unsubscribed from optional marketing notices. You cannot unsubscribe from legal notices, but if you’d prefer not to receive any further legal notices from Stripe, you can close your account by following <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/close-a-stripe-account#:~:text=Close%20a%20Stripe%20account%20%3A%20Stripe%3A%20Help%20%26%20Support&amp;text=The%20owner%20of%20the%20account,Close%20account...%27" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span><u>these steps</u></span></a>.</p>
<p>Your continued use of Stripe&#39;s services after 10 April 2023 is subject to these fee changes. Any termination rights you have under your agreement with us are unaffected by this change.</p>
