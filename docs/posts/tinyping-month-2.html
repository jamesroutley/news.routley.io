    <h1>tinyping month 2</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><em>Brian Hicks, April 1, 2024</em></p><p>Let&#39;s talk about tinyping. The thing-a-month project is meant to be a thing a month, full stop. But sometimes life gets in the way: between illness and a long-scheduled and much-needed vacation, I didn&#39;t have the time I needed to do a good job on tinyping in March.</p><p>But I really think it&#39;s a good idea, and not such a big one. It&#39;s also pretty close to being usable! So this month I&#39;m going to double down on it, breaking my own rules about the &#34;things&#34; only taking a month.</p><p>So here&#39;s a quick status report, and where I hope to get to in April:</p><span id="continue-reading"></span><ul><li>Ping caculation can be distributed among multiple clients in a reliable way, which should keep the right distribution from the two posts in early March (<a href="https://bytes.zone/micro/thing-a-month-04-01/@./thing-a-month-03-01.md">1</a>, <a href="https://bytes.zone/micro/thing-a-month-04-01/@./thing-a-month-03-02.md">2</a>)</li><li>Style is... really not there yet.</li><li>Neither is reporting.</li><li>You also can&#39;t sync data anywhere, which is especially bad on mobile (and <em>especially</em> on mobile Safari, which will delete stuff in IndexedDB after only 7 days of inactivity if you don&#39;t pin the app to the home screen.)</li><li>Nothing is deployed anywhere.</li></ul><p>So here are the goals for April:</p><ol><li>Get reporting working. This is a core thingâ€”there&#39;s not much point entering the data if we can&#39;t get the results.</li><li>Get notifications on new pings. This is almost done, and just needs a little push to get it over the line.</li><li>Get some semblance of style. It&#39;s <em>really</em> rough right now, and nothing I&#39;d want to show someone else.</li><li>Get syncing to a server, at least for backup. I might have to drop encryption to get this done in April; that&#39;s OK.</li></ol><p>And the things I&#39;m <em>not</em> going to do (unless I miraculously get the above done):</p><ul><li>Multiple tags per ping</li><li>Bulk editing</li><li>Integration into other systems</li><li>Any kind of native or mobile app</li></ul><p>My work&#39;s cut out for me; let&#39;s go!</p></article></div>
