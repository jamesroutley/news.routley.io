<p>I went on a small journey the last couple days to find the original Netscape
Navigator “meteors” animation. This one has a special place in my head and
heart because it is so clearly connected to my memories of discovering the
web as a kid. Here it is in its original 60×60 px glory:</p>

<p>I started out doing some web searches that turned up several versions. One was
promising but far too big: 400×400 px. Worse, after some shoddy resize
attempts, the “pixels” had become rectangular.</p>

<p>This would not do.</p>
<p>I continued searching, hoping to find the original animations. I found someone’s
<a href="https://github.com/zii/netscape">mirror of Netscape 5.0 on Github</a>. Then I found some <a href="https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/source/">very old
versions of Mozilla</a> on a Mozilla FTP server. Sadly, the
animations had been stripped out of these archives. :(</p>
<p>Frustrated with hitting several deadends, I complained to <a href="https://tess.oconnor.cx">Tess</a> and
wondered aloud if anyone might have the original images stashed away somewhere.
She quipped that if anyone did, it would be Jamie Zawinski.</p>
<p>A little later, I posted about it on Mastodon.</p>

<p>And wouldn’t you know it, a friend tagged <a href="https://mastodon.social/@jwz"><code>@jwz</code></a> asking if he had
it, and a few moments later I got a reply from <a href="https://www.jwz.org">Jamie</a> himself.</p>

<p>If you don’t know, Jamie Zawinski is well-know for working on several important
software projects in the ’90s. He worked on Netscape Navigator, built and
maintains <a href="https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/">Xscreensaver</a>, and several other things. Nowadays, he
owns and runs <a href="https://www.jwz.org">DNA Lounge</a> in San Francisco.</p>
<p>There are a lot of neat bits of web browser history on the page he linked –
totally worth a quick look over – but most important to the quest at hand, it
had that Netscape meteors loading animation.</p>
<p>The original one has some small artifacts on the left side of frame 10 that
render as red and orange pixels. These bothered me enough that I made a version
that replaces those pixels with ones that match the surrounding pixels. Here’s
the modified 60×60 one and a bigger 240×240 px one, for good
measure:</p>
