    <h1>100k TPS over a billion rows: the unreasonable effectiveness of SQLite</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><hgroup><p><time datetime="2025-12-02T00:00:00+00:00">02 Dec 2025</time></p></hgroup><hr/><p>SQLite doesn&#39;t have MVCC! It only has a single writer! SQLite is for phones and mobile apps (and the occasional airliner)! For web servers use a proper database like Postgres! In this article I&#39;ll go over why  being embedded and a single writer are not deficiencies but actually allow SQLite to scale so unreasonably well.</p><h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2><p>For the code examples I will be using Clojure. But, what they cover should be applicable to most programming language.</p><p>The machine these benchmarks run on has the following specs:</p><ul><li>MacBook Pro (2021)</li><li>Chip: Apple M1 Pro</li><li>Memory: 16 GB</li></ul><p>These benchmarks are not meant to be perfect or even optimal. They are merely to illustrate that it&#39;s relatively easy to achieve decent write throughput with SQLite. Usual benchmark disclaimers apply. </p><h2 id="defining_tps">Defining TPS</h2><p>When I say TPS I don&#39;t mean writes/updates per second. I&#39;m talking about transactions per second, specifically interactive transactions that are common when building web applications. By interactive transactions I mean transactions where you execute some queries, run some application code and then execute more queries. For example:</p><pre><code>BEGIN;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00
    WHERE name = &#39;Alice&#39;;
-- some application code runs
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00
    WHERE name = &#39;Bob&#39;;
COMMIT;
</code></pre><p>Transactions are useful because they let you rollback the state of your changes if your application encounters a problem.</p><h2 id="the_benchmark_harness">The benchmark harness</h2><p>To simulate requests we spin up <code>n</code> virtual threads (green threads) that each execute a function <code>f</code> this is analogous to handlers on a web server and will give us similar contention. Worth noting that this is high burst. I.e we will reach <code>n</code> level concurrent requests as fast as the system can spin up the virtual threads.</p><pre><code><span>(</span>defmacro <strong>tx-per-second</strong> [n &amp; body]

</code></pre><p>For the Clojure programmers among you <code>future</code> has been altered to use virtual threads. So, we can spin up millions if we need to.</p><pre><code><span>;; Make futures use virtual threads

What&#39;s terrifying about this is no amount of additional (cpu/servers/memory) is going to save us. This is a hard limit caused by the network. What&#39;s worse, in any unexpected increase in latency will exacerbate the problem.

At the time I didn&#39;t understand why we were hitting this hard limit in TPS.
