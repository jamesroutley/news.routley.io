    <h1>Applying to RC : Beginning of my Recursion Stack</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <h2 id="why-rc">Why RC?</h2>
<p>After moving from Munich to Seattle in early 2025, I&#39;ve been on a career break, using the time to prepare for interviews, work on side projects, and learn new things. I&#39;ve followed several RC alums, especially <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2020/11/05/i-m-doing-another-recurse-center-batch-/">Julia Evans</a>, for quite a while and have always dreamt of pursuing an experience like this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, since I started programming, I&#39;ve never truly built or learned something from scratch that wasn&#39;t driven by an extrinsic motivation, such as securing a job or upskilling for a work project. While I&#39;ve enjoyed that deterministic and practical approach, my creative side has never felt satisfied. For me, the joy of writing poetry, taking photographs, or cooking a delicacy has always stemmed from pure pleasure.</p>
<p>So, the core idea behind this programming &#34;retreat,&#34; beyond simply learning new things, is to find pleasure in programming and create something I can personally consume dailyâ€”whether it&#39;s a game, a new skill, or simply exploring programming tidbits. My plan is to attend RC in a hybrid format: starting virtually from Seattle for the first month, then joining in person in NYC for the following one-two months, balancing the experience with the cost of living there.</p>
<h2 id="how-rc">How RC?</h2>
<p>RC has a very helpful <a href="https://www.recurse.com/apply">page</a> that details the application steps. In my written <a href="https://www.recurse.com/apply/retreat">application</a>, I aimed for thoroughness and complete honesty. In my opinion, they&#39;re looking for individuals who, while not necessarily seasoned developers, possess some experience with programming concepts; professional programming experience is a definite plus.</p>
<p>After the written application, the next stage was a &#34;cultural interview.&#34; This interview explored my interests and experience, assessing how well they aligned with RC&#39;s philosophy. While they advise against extensive preparation, I personally prepped for the following questions. Of course, there&#39;s no single &#34;right&#34; answer, and responses depend on individual perspectives, but I still recommend practicing your answers aloud to calm any pre-interview jitters.</p>
<ul>
<li>What do you think RC is?</li>
<li>Why do you want to attend RC?</li>
<li>What are you working on currently?</li>
<li>What do you hope to get out of your time here?</li>
<li>How would you tell if your batch was a success?</li>
<li>Tell me about a bug that you solved recently?</li>
</ul>
<p>After successfully navigating the previous rounds, the final step was a <strong>pair programming exercise</strong>. You can pick from their provided <a href="https://www.recurse.com/pairing-tasks">tasks</a> or choose your own. The process involves submitting a working code solution for your chosen task in a GitHub repository. Then, during the interview, you&#39;ll pair program with one of RC alum, demonstrating your thought process and working to build an extension or new feature for the code.</p>
<p>They explicitly advise against over-preparing for this round. However, as someone with limited pair programming experience, I was quite nervous. I spent time considering potential extensions and features for the task I submitted. Since Python is my only programming language, I was comfortable coding in it, but I was also aware of the possibility of &#34;trick questions.&#34;</p>
<p>Despite my initial nerves, my experience was very positive. The interviewer was friendly, and we had a great discussion about edge cases where the code might fail, as well as potential optimizations for efficiency and speed. While I wasn&#39;t able to fully implement the feature we discussed, I believe the time constraints mean the focus is more on how you think and structure your code rather than delivering a complete, working solution.</p>
<p>Just a week after my final interview, the acceptance email arrived! I chose to enroll in the summer batch of 2025.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-during-rc">What&#39;s during RC?</h2>
<p>So, I don&#39;t have a concrete plan to do a specific thing during my time at RC. But these are the following things/stuff that I&#39;m interested to work/learn</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vibe coding</strong> an event website from the ground up</li>
<li>Building a <strong>word game</strong> from scratch.</li>
<li>Penning some insightful (or at least entertaining) <strong>blog posts</strong> about whatever fascinating things I learn.</li>
<li>Completing the <strong>HuggingFace AI Agent</strong> course and then building my own agent sidekick.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-after-rc">What after RC?</h2>
<p>Given the challenging job market in the US, my plan is to begin my job search immediately after concluding my time at RC in a couple of months. Towards the end of my program, I&#39;ll also dedicate time to resume my preparation for ML and Software System Design along with LeetCode.</p>
