    <h1>Disqus Turned My Blog into an Ad Farm – So I Killed It</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><div><h4 id="intro">Intro<a href="#intro"></a></h4><p>This will be a short and sweet post. As I’m not big on goodbyes.</p><p>Disqus started showing ads for their “free” tier comments system a few years back. At the time, the communication they sent out via email, seemed quite laid-back and had the tone of “don’t worry about it, it’s not a big thing”. Which in part lead me to almost forget it happened.</p><p>At the time, the disqus comments system looked quite smart and sleek. I remember thinking that the ads system will possibly look smart and sleek too. Which alleviated any worries I had at the time.</p><p>WELL…….I’ve just seen the ads, and they look horrific!!!</p><h4 id="apologies">Apologies<a href="#apologies"></a></h4><p>I have a <a href="https://pi-hole.net/" target="_blank">Pihole</a> set up, so ads are blocked on my home network. When I’m out of the house, my phone is connected to a <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank">Wireguard VPN</a> which routes my data through my home internet, therefore - getting all the ad-blocking, Pihole goodness.</p><p>After years with Pi-hole, which now blocks over a million domains, I’ve become incredibly accustomed to a mostly ad-free web. Without realizing it, I’d forgotten what the typical internet experience feels like.</p><p>I used to get a couple of emails from Disqus, letting me know that there’s a new comment on this blog. I haven’t had many of these emails recently, so I decided to disable my adblocker for a few minutes and check out the comments.</p><p>There were none, instead I was greeted by some horribly formatted and obviously scammy ads:</p><figure><a><img data-src="./disqus_ads.webp" data-action="zoom" alt="Horrible Disqus Ads"/></a></figure><p>For the people who read this blog, I’m sorry.</p><p>I became “blind” to what the web is really like for most users. I’ve tried to keep this blog minimalist - a clean place to find answers. Those ads not only ruin that experience; they trample privacy too:</p><figure><a><img data-src="./disqus_traffic.webp" data-action="zoom" alt="Screenshot of Firefox Dev Tools. Showing a worrying amount of tracking requests"/></a></figure><p>With this post, I’ve removed Disqus. It was making my blog worse, and frankly, they were profiting off my work and my visitor’s data.
I want this blog to be a resource for devs and technologists, free not just in money, but in freedom from unwanted tracking and invasive ads.</p><h4 id="any-alternatives">Any Alternatives?<a href="#any-alternatives"></a></h4><p>I’m not entirely sure comments are needed here. There are other ways to reach me, for example; <a href="https://github.com/ryansouthgate" target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/ryan_southgate" target="_blank">Twitter/X</a>. But having a place for discussion under each post can be valuable.
If you have any recommendations for alternative commenting systems (especially those that respect privacy or are self-hosted), I’d love to hear them! Please reach out if you’ve found something that works well.</p><p>Thanks as always for reading - your trust matters to me.</p><p><em>Sorry again for the mess!</em></p><hr/><hr/></div></div></div></article></div>
