    <h1>Avoid Meaningless Binary Labels</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-layout-label="Post Body" data-type="item" data-updated-on="1641279057740" id="item-61d3edf5638a8e71656f9475"><div><div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1641355030014_1244"><div><p>Imagine this: you&#39;re getting some medical test for some condition, and it&#39;s <strong>falsely</strong> returned a <strong>negative</strong> even though you should be testing positive.
What should we call that scenario?
That&#39;s right, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors"><code>&#34;Type II error&#34;</code></a>!
WTF?</p>
<p>Or imagine this: you&#39;re thinking about a pop psychology book you read a decade ago, which mentioned the two main ways that people think.
Sometimes it&#39;s carefully considered and logical, what you think of when you <em>think</em> &#34;thinking&#34;.
But sometimes it&#39;s unconscious and emotional, more like an instinctive reaction than anything deliberate.
Now - without looking it up, which one of these was <code>&#34;System 1&#34;</code> and which is <code>&#34;System 2&#34;</code>?
Are you sure?</p>
<p>Daniel Kahneman, if you&#39;re reading this - how could you torture us like this?
You literally titled the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow"><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a>!
Why isn&#39;t it <code>&#34;Fast&#34;</code> and <code>&#34;Slow&#34;</code>?</p>
<p>Worst of all, imagine this: you&#39;ve just started an internship at a tech company with a microservices-based architecture.
When service A initiates a message to service B, one of them is called the <code>&#34;upstream&#34;</code>, and the other is the <code>&#34;downstream&#34;</code>.
Which one is which?
There&#39;s no inherent direction, so <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/59458012">even within the industry, people don&#39;t agree!</a></p>

<p>Meaningless binary labels is the laziest way to be bad at naming things.
Please say <code>&#34;false positive&#34;</code> instead of <code>&#34;Type I error&#34;</code>.
Or <code>&#34;client + server&#34;</code> or <code>&#34;caller + callee&#34;</code> instead of <code>&#34;upstream + downstream&#34;</code>.
I&#39;ll admit <code>&#34;fast system&#34;</code> and <code>&#34;slow system&#34;</code> are a little lame... but it&#39;s way harder to mix up than <code>&#34;System 1&#34;</code> and <code>&#34;System 2&#34;</code>.
Hopefully by the time you start to share your binary categorization with others, you&#39;ll know enough to label them descriptively.</p>
<p>Some related thoughts on naming:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even if you have a lot of options you can still give them meaningful names. For example, <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16Personalities</a> assigns a cute name like <code>&#34;Virtuoso&#34;</code> or <code>&#34;Advocate&#34;</code> for each of the Myers-Briggs results, which makes them much more memorable. <sup data-preserve-html-node="true" id="return-1"><a href="#footnote-1">[footnote 1]</a></sup></li>
<li>It&#39;s probably okay to assign arbitrary-ish names if there&#39;s really no meaningful distinction except that they&#39;re different: think the ABO blood type system. <sup data-preserve-html-node="true" id="return-2"><a href="#footnote-2">[footnote 2]</a></sup></li>
<li>Equations that are named after people also tend to be meaningless; what if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyle%27s_law"><code>&#34;Boyle&#39;s law&#34;</code></a> were called the <code>&#34;pressure-volume inverse relation&#34;</code>? Admittedly, that is a mouthful. In electrical engineering, thankfully, people do often do refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws"><code>Kirchhoff&#39;s first and second laws</code></a> as <code>&#34;Kirchhoff&#39;s current law / junction rule&#34;</code> and <code>&#34;Kirchhoff&#39;s voltage law / loop rule&#34;</code> instead.</li>
<li>On the other hand, it is sometimes useful to have names that are specifically meaningless; for example in programming, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar">foo and bar</a>, or in computer security, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob">Alice and Bob</a>.</li>
</ul>

Thanks Yee Aun for bouncing these ideas around with me. Not-thanks to whoever coined and popularized the usage of <code>&#34;upstream and downstream&#34;</code> in microservice architecture.

Of course, if you don&#39;t believe in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, that means you&#39;re an INTJ <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/27/on-types-of-typologies/">(to paraphrase Scott Alexander quoting Tumblr user tropylium)</a>.</p>

<p>[footnote 2] <a data-preserve-html-node="true" id="footnote-2" href="#return-2">(back to content)</a>
And in fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABO_blood_group_system#History">the Wikipedia page&#39;s history section</a> describes how blood types were at various points in history described using the completely arbitrary [A, B, C], as well as two mutually-incompatible versions of [I, II, III, IV], until Landsteiner&#39;s 1927 proposal of the modern ABO system and consequent adoption by the National Research Council.
This was done because if you mix up blood types, you can kill people; so unfortunately, we are unlikely to see the disappearance of <code>&#34;Type I and II errors&#34;</code> unless statisticians get a lot more hardcore.</p>
