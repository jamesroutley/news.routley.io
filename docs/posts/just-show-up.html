            <p>You have a friend who is:</p><p>playing in a band and invited you to their show? Just show up.</p><p>coaching a volleyball team in the semi-finals? Just show up.</p><p>showing their artwork or photography? Just show up.</p><p>organizing a professional event/meetup? Just show up.</p><p>hosting their kid&#39;s birthday party that you got invited to last minute and is an hour drive away? Just show up.</p><p>Time is both the most and least precious thing we have. It all depends on how you use it. It can mean so much to those we choose to spend it with when they least expect it. Chances are those few hours would have slipped by unnoticed, why not make them count? You&#39;ll never regret being there for people who matter.</p><p>Just show up.</p>
