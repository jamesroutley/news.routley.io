    <h1>0041: columnar kernels in go, go grouches, column sketches, why user-mode threads, gross margins vs open source, celebrity worship</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I&#39;m currently doing some consulting, adding a vectorized query engine to a project written in go. I wrote a thing - <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/columnar-kernels-in-go/">columnar kernels in go</a> - about some prep work I did before starting, figuring out how to translate familiar idioms into this foreign (to me) language.</p>
<h2 id="go-grouches">go grouches</h2>
<p>So far I&#39;m extremely unimpressed with go. </p>
<p>It disallows using compound types as map keys, requiring javascript-like stringifying workarounds (I already wrestled through some code that should have just been a set of lists of keys). A restriction I could understand in the name of safety, if the rest of the language wasn&#39;t casually littered with footguns.</p>
<p>Implicit zero initialization, manual error checking, mixing implicit variable assignments with variable declarations (<code>a, b := ...</code> either declares two new variables, or declares one new variable and assigns to one existing variable). </p>
<p>Nil slices behave like empty slices, except when they don&#39;t (I already found a bug in existing code caused by this). Slices are passed by value but contain a reference to an underlying array. Calling append on a slice only does what you expect if the slice happens to point to the end of the array.</p>
<p>Changing a declaration from private to public requires capitalizing the name, causing pointlessly large diffs which conflict with unrelated changes.</p>
<p>Two things are really biting me though:</p>
<ul>
<li>The only way to create a sum type is to use an interface, which requires a heap allocation. </li>
<li>Generic functions, other than language builtins, are implemented by dict passing.</li>
</ul>
<p>The combination of these two mean that almost any abstraction that I make has a performance cost. Within the data-plane that cost is often unacceptably large. The result is that much of the code I&#39;m writing is boilerplate workarounds for the complete lack of zero-cost abstractions.</p>

<p>Goal is to accelarate column scans regardless of data distribution and workload. </p>
<p>Build a histogram of data. Divide into evenly full buckets. Give each bucket a short binary code. </p>
<p>Evaluate predicates against buckets first, and then scan for matching buckets.</p>
<p>Their experiments demonstrate good performance across different query selectivities with 1 byte codes over uniformly distributed 32 bit integers. </p>
<p>Performance remains identical under data skew, while bitweaving degrades.</p>
<p>Builds much faster than bitweaving too. (Note that BtrBlocks builds histograms anyway - might be able to produce the sketch almost for free.)</p>
<h2 id="why-user-mode-threads-are-good-for-performance"><a href="https://www.p99conf.io/session/why-user-mode-threads-are-good-for-performance/">Why User-Mode Threads Are Good for Performance</a></h2>
<p>Makes a really simple argument: If each task spends 1% time on cpu and 99% stalled, then we need at least 100 threads per core to saturate cpu. In a microservice architecture with high fanout, these numbers get bigger and bigger until the per-thread memory cost is the bottleneck. So the main importance of green threads is not reducing the cost of context-switching (which has been dramatically reduced in recent linux versions) but in reducing the memory cost per-stalled-task so that the fanout layer needs fewer machines.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know enough to decide whether or not I believe that argument, but it&#39;s interesting.</p>

<p>I was really struck by the idea that investors pursue gross margin and ignore net margin, and that this is poorly compatible with building a business around open-source software, which <strong>by design</strong> doesn&#39;t capture most of the value it produces.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Celebrity is becoming a requirement for some jobs and most sane people aren&#39;t built for it. [...]  I&#39;m a full-time author and in this media environment, the only way to reliably sell books is to become some form of celebrity. [...] I literally cannot write novels as a full time job unless I turn myself into a multimedia influencer that posts daily to a large, loyal, highly-engaged audience. [...] The rest of my writing career doesn&#39;t rest in my ability to generate story ideas or execute them - plenty of incredible novels sell fewer than a hundred lifetime copies - but in doing that extremely well and also making my personality and lifestyle interesting to the masses. I must become something other than a person, a symbol that can act as a receptacle for strangers&#39; excess emotions, including their random, ravenous hatred. </p>
