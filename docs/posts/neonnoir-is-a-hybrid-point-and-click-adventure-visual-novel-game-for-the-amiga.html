<h3>Description</h3>
<p><strong>NEONnoir</strong> is a hybrid point-and-click adventure/visual novel game for the Amiga 1200.</p>
<p>This game was created over 5 months for the Amiga Blitz Basic Game Jam whose purpose was to bring few faces into that community and help share knowledge of Blitz Basic programming.</p>
<p>I&#39;d never heard of Blitz Basic before, but the community was so supportive and uplifting that I could not help but participate. This is my flowery way of saying, <em>&#34;reader beware, my code is crap.&#34;</em> I would do things completely differently now that I&#39;ve learned so much. <br/></p>
<p>Five months sounds like a lot, but it&#39;s the longest I&#39;ve ever worked on a game. This is the most complex story I&#39;ve ever made and while it&#39;s silly and full of tropes, I&#39;m pretty proud of it.</p>
<h3>Your time is precious, here&#39;s a <a href="https://steamknight.itch.io/neonnoir/devlog/446413/neonnoir-walkthrough" target="_blank">walkthrough!</a></h3>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>In order to play the game you need an Amiga 1200 with a hard drive or an emulator, such as <a href="https://www.winuae.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" referrerpolicy="origin">WinUAE</a>. Unfortunately, in order to emulate an Amiga, you will need the system ROMs. Those can be purchased at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" referrerpolicy="origin">https://www.amigaforever.com/</a></p>
<p>Once you have a working environment, you need to download the NEONnoir.lha file and extract it on your hard drive. Find the NEONnoir executable and double-click it. You&#39;ll be solving mysteries in no time!</p>
<h3>How to play</h3>
<p>The game is point-and-click and it has a very minimal inventory system. You won&#39;t need to try every object on every surface in order to advance. However, here&#39;s how you control the game.</p>
<p>The game is entirely mouse driven. As such you will see 4 different types of mouse pointers:</p>

<p>You can access the game&#39;s menu to look at your inventory, save the game, or quit the game by clicking on the PDA icon on the bottom right of the screen. It looks like this:</p>

<h3>Code and License</h3>
<p>To make the game, I&#39;ve build a few tools for myself that run on Windows: palette editors, image converters, an assembly like language that runs user scripts inside the game, and of course a game editor. This code is also crap. I was throwing together things as quickly as possible. Good luck running the editor <strong><em>not</em><em></em></strong> attached to a debugger.</p>
