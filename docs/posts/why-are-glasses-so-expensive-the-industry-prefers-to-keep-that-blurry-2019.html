	<p>When I built my PC I did not want any of that RGB stuff, but the case I landed on had a glass sidepanel and it would be a shame if everything was just pitch black inside. So I decided to turn it into a magical terrarium.</p>

<p>Here is how I did it. The dragon fly is cut out of acrylic sheet on a laser cutter, which also etches the markings on the wings and tail. To do this I drew it in Inkscape using two different colours. In the laser cutter software you can then assign different profiles to each colour.</p>

<p>Then I used hot glue to insert an LED into the hole, which I covered up on the bottom with some black tape. I then cut one leg of the LED short and soldered a resistor to it. The value of the resistor depends on the voltage and the type of LED. You can of course calculate this but the YOLO way is to just <a href="https://www.tinytronics.nl/shop/en/components/leds/leds/blue-led-5mm-diffused">do what the shop says where you got them</a>.</p>

<p>To connect it I browsed the motherboard manual in search for a header with 5V, and in my case there was an addressable LED header of which I just left the data pin disconnected. I then routed the wire so that the dragonfly hangs nicely in the middle of the case.</p>

<p>Here is how it looks with the case open.</p>
