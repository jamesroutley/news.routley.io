    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>It’s been pretty quiet around here lately but I’m still alive and doing well (reminder: you can always see my current status at <a href="https://www.forrestthewoods.com/now">my /now page</a>). I’ve had a bit more time to write over Christmas break, which means I have a few posts in the works. Let’s start it off with a links round-up:</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong><a href="https://statesider.us/us-font-map/">The United Fonts of America</a></strong> - Andy Murdock takes all the fonts named after places in the US and puts them on a map. Simple and clever… I wish I had thought of it!</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BE3ZnFJ1u9o">The LED Exterior Facade of Burj Khalifa</a></strong> - Apparently the Burj Kalhifa is also a giant display screen? How haven’t I heard about this before? It makes me wonder if Americans (or American media) is just somehow aggressively uninterested in Dubai.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">Choose Boring Technology</a></strong> - “It is basically always the case that the long-term costs of keeping a system working reliably vastly exceed any inconveniences you encounter while building it.” What a quote. I also enjoyed Dan’s rules for adopting a new technology. This article feels like it should be required reading for engineers.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.mit.edu/people/dpolicar/writing/prose/text/thinkingMeat.html">They’re Made Out of Meat</a></strong> - A clever and fun science-fiction short story. I had to stop after a few paragraphs so I could read it out loud to my wife.
Made us laugh out loud.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eC1BAcOzHyY">Magnus Carlsen’s Mind-Blowing Memory</a></strong> - A video interview with Magnus Carlsen (the world’s best chess player). It follows a clever format where the interviewer sets up a chess position and asks Magnus which historical game it’s from. I’m not sure how “famous” the positions are but it looks pretty impressive to me.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://alula.github.io/SpaceCadetPinball/">Space Cadet Pinball</a></strong> - A decompiled version of the pinball game that came default with Windows XP, now playable in the browser. <a href="https://github.com/alula/SpaceCadetPinball">Source code is here</a>. I will not mention how much I have played this in the last two weeks. The nostalgia is too much for me.</p>
