              <p>CourtListener is hosted by Free Law Project, a small non-profit that punches way above its weight. We host some of the largest open legal databases on the planet, but we need your support to do our work. Please make a charitable donation today.
              </p>
              <p>In 2022, Free Law Project served nearly 200 million documents and sent more than 1.3 million alerts to our users. We <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeLawProject/status/1588664445609267200">added</a> millions of opinions to our database and <a href="https://free.law/2022/03/17/summarizing-important-cases/">summarized</a> over a million opinions. We launched <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/recap/email/">@recap.email</a> and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/webhooks/">legal webhooks</a>. In a few days, we will add appellate court support to the RECAP extension.</p>
              <p>On the policy side, we <a href="https://ross.house.gov/media/press-releases/president-biden-signs-law-ross-bill-enhance-judicial-ethics-and-transparency">helped</a> pass a law to publish judicial financial disclosures to eliminate conflicts of interest. We <a href="https://twitter.com/FreeLawProject/status/1601011543344152577">opposed</a> unconstitutional efforts to censor our website. We are working with others to develop a FOIA-like law for the judiciary.
              </p>
              <p>To learn more about our accomplishments and our goals for 2023, please read our annual letter. Once you do, we hope you will support our work with a charitable gift. The more you give, the more we can do.
