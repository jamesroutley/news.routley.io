<p><span>Sony&#39;s concern over a potential exclusivity of Activision&#39;s content is &#34;incoherent, to say the least,&#34; according to Microsoft in the documents made available by CADE. &#34;Considering that exclusivity strategies have been at the core of Sony&#39;s strategy to strengthen its presence in the games industry, and that Sony is a leader in the distribution of digital games,&#34; Microsoft writes.</span></p><p><span>&#34;It only shows, once again, a fear about an innovative business model that provides high-quality content to gamers at low costs, threatening a leadership that has been forged from a device-centric and exclusivity-focused strategy over the years,&#34; the author writes.</span></p><p><span><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="393" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds_XAdK_nBI" title="Xbox - July 2022 Games with Gold" width="699"></iframe></span></p><p><span>The statement continues, &#34;In fact, Sony&#39;s desire to impede such growth has prevented Microsoft from expanding Game Pass. To stop content creators from adding to Game Pass and other rival subscription services, Sony pays for &#34;blocking rights.&#34;</span></p><p><span>These kinds of platform agreements are common in the games industry, and in documents made public as part of the Epic vs. Apple lawsuit last year, PlayStation was even mentioned as blocking the appearance of third-party games on Game Pass.</span></p>
<p><span>The document is redacted to exclude the remainder of its response and two additional claims under the same section, presumably for privacy reasons.</span></p><p><span>In another section of the document, Microsoft argued that Sony &#34;railed against the introduction of new monetization models capable of challenging its business model&#34; and that Sony &#34;does not want attractive subscription services to threaten its dominance in the digital distribution market for console games.&#34;</span></p><table><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd1HB3H6hWRfRwkuhby_eg3Ou9_gY4ib-ldZlHp7XUMpNbsZCUaG8ys2kQUeaFaqE5bKUh1SPq0M6v8Y-5jGaPCK-ehyZxdDHO95NBIHModAwaDIu94CwGXjKh4pjapMgwhrdJXSrL-r03stQoCWTqf1xJWeJTz07CdeGATdwuzI8ay3Pia9JDkTFr/s1150/sony-playstation-game-pass.jpg"><span><img alt="Xbox is reportedly aiming to hit a target number of Game Pass subscribers before it considers dropping Xbox Live Gold" data-original-height="650" data-original-width="1150" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhd1HB3H6hWRfRwkuhby_eg3Ou9_gY4ib-ldZlHp7XUMpNbsZCUaG8ys2kQUeaFaqE5bKUh1SPq0M6v8Y-5jGaPCK-ehyZxdDHO95NBIHModAwaDIu94CwGXjKh4pjapMgwhrdJXSrL-r03stQoCWTqf1xJWeJTz07CdeGATdwuzI8ay3Pia9JDkTFr/s16000/sony-playstation-game-pass.jpg" title="Xbox is reportedly aiming to hit a target number of Game Pass subscribers before it considers dropping Xbox Live Gold"/></span></a></td></tr><tr><td><span><i>Before considering removing Xbox Live Gold, Xbox is reportedly aiming to reach a target number of Game Pass subscribers.</i></span></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span>Along with Bandai Namco and Ubisoft, Sony was one of several outside businesses that gave CADE feedback last month on the proposed Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</span></p><p><span>Because Xbox has &#34;an essential game - a blockbuster, a AAA-type game that has no rival,&#34; according to Sony, the acquisition may persuade users to switch platforms.</span></p>
<p><span>Should Microsoft&#39;s acquisition of Activision Blizzard be successful, Phil Spencer, head of gaming at Microsoft, declared in January that he intended to keep Call of Duty available on PlayStation platforms.</span></p><p><span>Later, it was asserted that Activision Blizzard was legally bound to release only the upcoming Call of Duty titles Modern Warfare 2 and the following three for PlayStation consoles.</span></p>
