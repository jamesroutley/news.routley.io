    <h1>Show HN: I store my critical secrets and document, and communicate privately</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      

      

<p>Better privacy, without special software.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR;</h2>

<p>Portable Secret is a little hack that allows you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Send encrypted messages/images/files over insecure channels (email, messaging, …)</li>
  <li>Store sensitive information (passwords, documents) in insecure locations (web, Cloud drives, USB drives)</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s portable because: <strong>decrypting these secrets does not require special software!</strong>
All you need is a browser.</p>

<p>I created Portable Secret <strong>to securely exchange documents via email with my mother</strong>, who can’t be expected to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/age">age</a>, or similar.</p>

<p>I also use Portable Secret to store some my most sensitive secrets (private keys, 2FA recovery codes, etc.)</p>

<p>Finally, I use it to store copies of important documents (like a picture of passport). These documents are accessible to me from anywhere, <strong>even if all my trusted devices have been stolen or lost</strong>.</p>

<p>Sounds too good to be true? Keep reading. This is for you.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Portable Secret is not a product and it is barely a project.
<strong>It is just a neat trick, a <em>hack</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mprimi/portable-secret">source code</a> and <a href="https://mprimi.github.io/portable-secret/creator/">creator tool</a> are provided as a demonstration.</p>

<hr/>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>A ‘Portable Secret’ is simply an HTML file that also contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>An encrypted payload</li>
  <li>Some Javascript that calls into the browser’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API">Web Cryptography APIs</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Any (reasonably modern) web browser can open the file, even without an internet connection!
If you know the password, you can recover the secret within.</p>

<p><a href="https://mprimi.github.io/portable-secret/examples/example-message.html">Here’s an example</a> (the password is <code>banana</code>)</p>

<p>Notice that the file is self-contained and has no external dependencies!
It can be carried on a USB drive and decrypted without an internet connection, on any device that has a web browser.</p>

<p>To understand how it works, go ahead and <a href="https://mprimi.github.io/portable-secret/creator/">create yourself a secret</a>. Download and inspect the generated Portable Secret.</p>

<p>The embedded code is straightforward:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take the password and generate a key</li>
  <li>Use the key to decrypt the payload</li>
  <li>Display the decrypted secret</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-i-use-portable-secret">How I use Portable Secret</h2>

<h3 id="private-communication">Private communication</h3>

<p>Do you want to communicate privately with people, but you can’t expect them to learn how to use PGP?</p>

<p>Send a Portable Secret. For example as email attachment.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey ___, attached to this email is the PDF and data you requested, but it’s encrypted. Never double-click on attachments, it’s dangerous! Give me a call when you get this, and I’ll show you how to read it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whenever they call me, I tell them:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Right-click on the attachment and ‘Open with…’ any browser.
The password is ‘banana_split’.
Now you can save the decrypted PDF.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="store-top-level-secrets">Store top-level secrets</h3>

<p>Some secrets don’t belong in your password manager. Things like backup private keys, 2FS recovery keys, wallet keys, safe combinations, treasure maps, etc.</p>

<p>Using Portable Secret, I can keep copies of these critical keys all over the place (Cloud drives, USB drives, all my devices, etc).</p>

<p>Even if some of these copies end up stolen (e.g. I lose a USB stick), I am not concerned anyone will be able to recover the secrets within.</p>

<p>The passwords are long sequence of words that are trivial for me to remember (thanks to the hints provided), but impossible for anyone else to guess or crack.</p>

<h3 id="emergency-documents-on-the-go">Emergency documents on the go</h3>

<p>Have you ever gotten stranded in a foreign country without any of your devices or documents? It’s not fun.</p>

<p>I keep a copy of my passport encrypted on the internet. It’s just an HTML file, it’s easy to host. If I find myself stranded again, I can use any computer/device to retrieve it.</p>

<p><a href="https://mprimi.github.io/portable-secret/examples/example-image.html">Here’s an example of ID document safely encrypted in plain sight</a>.</p>

<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3 id="crack-me-if-you-can">Crack me if you can</h3>

<p>Do you think this cannot possibly be secure? Great, prove it.</p>

<p><a href="https://mprimi.github.io/portable-secret/examples/bounty.html">This secret</a> contains the recovery key for a Bitcoin wallet. Crack it and take my money!</p>

<h3 id="choosing-a-good-password">Choosing a good password</h3>

<p>Choosing a strong-enough password is key (pun intended).</p>

<p>Eventually I’ll fill in this paragraph. For now all you get is the obligatory XKCD: <a href="https://xkcd.com/936/">correct-horse-battery-staple</a></p>

<h3 id="on-tools">On tools</h3>

<p>Portable Secret is a <em>tool</em>. As such, it can be used <em>wrong</em> (e.g. weak password), or used to do bad things (e.g., exfiltrate intellectual property).</p>

<p>I cannot take responsibility for such misuse any more than a hammer manufacturer can take responsibility for me hammering my thumb, or using the hammer to attack someone.</p>

<h3 id="prior-art">Prior art</h3>

<p>I came up with Portable Secret on my own, but I have since found a few projects that do something similar.</p>

<p>https://github.com/kaushalmeena/digi-cloak</p>
