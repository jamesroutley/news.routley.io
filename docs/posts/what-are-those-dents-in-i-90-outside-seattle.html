<p>Yeah, reflectors are usually installed on the lines, not in the tire ruts. There are so many of these divots, so close together, for such a long stretch of road, as to make reflectors highly doubtful. A reflector in each dent would make the road surface blinding. (True story: I was riding with my sister one night, returning home from a concert in Puyallup, and we came around a curve in the highway and entered a construction area. There were so many reflectors that my sister literally could not see the road.) And reflectors only in the right lane?</p>

<p>But, again, only in the right lane? The right lane is, of course, where an extremely slow-moving piece of equipment would travel. A construction vehicle with the type of wheels I described would indeed be traveling <em>very</em> slowly. &lt;Forensics hat on&gt; Logic dictates that in ordinary circumstances, the distance involved would make it sensible to load such a slow-moving vehicle onto a flatbed truck, and transport it to the work site that way. My theory that the vehicle was instead <em>driven</em> to the site under its own power suggests that it was too big to load onto a truck – big and heavy enough to leave dents in the pavement as it went. &lt;/forensics hat off&gt;</p>

<p>I gotta believe that there’s been some miscommunication about which divots are being dicussed. I was talking about this with some Seattle natives last night and no one remembers reflectors ever being in those slots. Plus, the fact that some of the recent I-5 construction also exhibits these marks leads me to think this has to be construction-machinery related.</p>

<p>The following answer is speculative, based on the information provided by <strong>racer72</strong>’s brother:</p>
<p>Consider a snowy highway. Three lanes in each direction, or two lanes for the mountainous stretches of I-90. What’s more efficient, running a plow up one side, then back down the same side to clear the snow off <em>all</em> the pavement, and then repeat both moves on the other side of the highway for traffic running the other direction (or have two plows running simultaneously); or running the plow <em>once</em> up the middle of each side?</p>
<p>Obviously, it’s a lot faster and more efficient to run a single plow once in each direction. But this gives you a single plowed track up each side of the highway, rather than clearing both (or all three) lanes entirely.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable to me that if the plow goes up the middle of each side, the resulting track will basically disregard the original lane markings, and will instead follow the middle track represented by the parallel-to-traffic-flow divots described. In snowy conditions requiring plowing, there won’t be a huge amount of cars on the road, so a single lane should suffice until more extensive work can be scheduled; and even if there is increased traffic in the single lane, you don’t want them going at freeway speeds anyway, so the volume packing the lane will slow things down. And what’s more, the “path” of reflectors is more easily seen below the one or two inches of snow that will still cover them, as they’re recessed in the divots and the plow won’t scrape off every last millimeter of snow above the reflective plastic.</p>
<p>Also: Why would the reflectors be “blinding” just because they’re in divots and there are a few more of them side to side? Just make them a slightly different color and post some signs, and make sure the regular lane markers are distinct, and there shouldn’t be any problem.</p>
<p>Again, this is just my WAG, and I await correction by more informed posters, but as long as we’re just speculating, my description makes sense to me.</p>
<p>(For the record, I drive that highway also, and have wondered about this myself.)</p>

        <p>I think we really need somebody to take a picture of these dents, so that it’s absolutely clear what we’re talking about.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately I’m now home in Idaho, so somebody else is going to have to do it.  I agree that pictures would be a good idea.</p>
<p>I know less than nothing about snow removal equipment, really (I just moved to Idaho!), but my first thought was that if they’re related to that they’re some sort of guide for the plows to stay nice and centered in the right lane.  I could be totally, completely wrong, this is a WAG.</p>

          <p>Yaaagh!!! They’re spreading.  I see them on I5 southbound going up Southcenter Hill toward Kent, second lane fronm the curb.  I noticed they look like cuts in the concrete and they are placed at each expansion joint.  I don’t think they are there stritly because the concrete is swelling or tilting because the road is even worse at the top of the hill and they are only on the steep slope.</p>
<p>The cuts are so narrow, I suspect they are some kind of inspection or test in preparation for repaving.  Anybody recall a late night lane closure on Southbound 5 at Southcenter Hill?  Funny there are no cuts or whatever they are on the Northbound side.</p>

<p>How about some empirical data? I was actually stopped in traffic for a bit on southbound I-5 just before the S. 188th Street exit, in the second lane, right over the marks. For the first time, I saw that they did in fact cross each joint in the concrete, and were only in the second lane as the other lanes didn’t have the same visible joints. They were clearly cut out, had some sort of rod placed as noted in an earlier post, then refilled with concrete. As soon as that type of expansion joint was no longer used, the marks disappeared.</p>

<p>Well, your brother was wrong.  Which is a classic example of why a picture is worth a thousand words; I think what your brother thought you were describing was recessed reflectors, but that’s not what was actually under discussion.</p>

<p>Awesome! Now I can see that <em>I</em> was wrong. Traveling at highway speeds (and maybe because I wasn’t wearing my glasses), I didn’t notice that the “dents” were on expansion joints, and they’re not as close together as I thought. But those still photos make it nice and clear <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=10" title=":slight_smile:" alt=":slight_smile:"/> Thanks to your friend for the photos, and thank you for asking him/her!</p>

          <p>Okay, it makes perfect sense now that those repetitive recessed areas in the Freeway are from dowel bar retrofits to maintain the level of the mating road sections, but it’s my understanding that they were originally filled up to the level of the surrounding road surface and relatively smooth.  I assume they have been worn away over time by the constant beating of vehicle tires, studs, etc. to make the sunken divots we experience today, so why can’t they be refilled to level so they’re not so annoying to drive on?</p>
<p>If there’s no other cars around I frequently drive in the left lane to avoid them, but that’s technically illegal.  Also, I would think that being lower than the surrounding surface they would accumulate water, freeze, and cause more of a hazard and further deterioration than otherwise.  Does anyone have a contact that works for the State that might know why they don’t refill these annoying things, if they are indeed dowel bar retrofits?  They’re a total pain.</p>

          <p>Here’s some footage of the hot -n- heavy action of dowel placement.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud5AdEPL16A" rel="nofollow noopener">WSDOT 1-82 Dowel Bar Retrofit</a></p>
<p>However the one time I saw it in action, it was more of an assembly line process. There was a large flatbed with the dowels driving slowly along the closed lane with a pack of workers scooping up handfuls and dropping them into the pre-cut slots. A concrete pourer brought up the rear. Not nearly as precise as the video shows.</p>

My 16 year old is driving to Yakima this afternoon and was asking so we looked it up and found this site. I will upload a picture when site allows me to do so.</p>

          <p>I was wondering why nobody posted a Google Street View but then I saw this is a zombie thread.  Nonetheless, it looks like this is what everyone’s talking about:</p>

<p>And yes, those are retrofitted dowel bars.  Maybe they didn’t use the best grout and that’s wearing away faster than the surrounding concrete.  Regarding <a href="https://boards.straightdope.com/u/racer72">@racer72</a>’s comment, there are ALSO recessed reflectors, but only along the painted lines.  So there’s two different things going on.</p>
