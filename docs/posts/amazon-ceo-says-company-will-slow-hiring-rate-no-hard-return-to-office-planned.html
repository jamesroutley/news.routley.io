    <h1>Amazon CEO says company will slow hiring rate, no hard return to office planned</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says the parent firm of the world&#39;s largest cloud service provider will likely slow the rate at which it&#39;s hiring staff, while noting he has no plans to force current workers to return to the office.</p>
<p>Jassy <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/07/andy-jassy-says-he-wont-force-amazon-workers-to-return-to-the-office.html">told</a> the Code Conference in Los Angeles last night: &#34;We don&#39;t have a plan to require people to come back... But we&#39;re going to proceed adaptively as we learn.&#34;</p>
<p>He also <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-ceo-charts-slower-hiring-following-pandemic-boom-11662583104">noted</a> at the same conference that he didn&#39;t think &#34;you&#39;ll see us hiring at the same rates that we did,&#34; adding: &#34;But we&#39;ll be hiring.&#34;</p>

    

<p>In July, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.costar.com/article/1618933712/amazon-suspends-office-projects-in-seattle-nashville">Amazon paused construction</a> on six new office buildings in Bellevue and Nashville, saying it needed to &#34;reevaluate&#34; the designs to suit hybrid work.</p>

        


        

<p>John Schoettler, vice president of Global Real Estate and Facilities at Amazon, said in a statement shared at the time: &#34;The pandemic has significantly changed the way people work... Our offices are long-term investments and we want to make sure that we design them in a way that meets our employees&#39; needs in the future. This doesn&#39;t affect our plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in the city.&#34;</p>
<p>That was the same month that the retail and cloud juggernaut reported its earnings for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/07/28/amazon-amzn-q2-2022-earnings-call-transcript/">Q2 2022</a>, where CFO Brian Olsavsky, responding to a question about a quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount, said the company had &#34;added 14,000 workers in Q1,&#34; conceding that in the &#34;prior year we had reduced our net headcount by 27,000.&#34;</p>

        

<p>He went on to add: &#34;I would note that we&#39;re still up 188,000 year over year and nearly double the headcount of what we had heading into the pandemic in early 2020.... Right now, we see a stabilization in the workforce.&#34;</p>
<p>The move to pull back on committing to office space and reported moves to shed warehouse space come against the backdrop of historic <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/08/31/hp/">inflation</a> that has affected consumer purchasing decisions, impacting Amazon&#39;s core e-commerce business.</p>
<p>The group is coming off a high of two years of record pandemic profits as locked-in householders turned to online shopping. However, in its most recent numbers, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/29/aws_q2_2022/">for the second 2022 quarter ended June</a>, it reported a $2 billion net loss. The cloud division continued to do well, growing revenue 33 per cent to $19.73 billion and reporting operating profit of $5.715 billion, up more than 36 percent. Much of the group&#39;s net loss for the quarter could be attributed to paper losses on its stake in electric vehicle maker Rivian (amounting to $11.5 billion for the first two quarters of 2022), but seen against the $7.778 billion in net income it took in for the same quarter in 2021, the contrast was stark.</p>

        

<p>The effects of the company&#39;s sales during Prime Day 2022 will only be seen when it reports Q3.</p>
<p>Jassy, tasked with cutting costs, said of the Q2 earnings that &#34;despite continued inflationary pressures in fuel, energy and transportation costs,&#34; Amazon was &#34;making progress on the more controllable costs.&#34;</p>

<p>It&#39;s seemingly not the only conservative real estate move Amazon has made recently. Last <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-02/amazon-closes-abandons-plans-for-dozens-of-us-warehouses#xj4y7vzkg?leadSource=uverify%20wall">week</a>, consulting firm MWPVL International Inc claimed Amazon was expected to scrap plans to build several warehouse facilities across the US amid slowed sales growth.</p>
<p>In May, Amazon reportedly made moves to shed at least 10 million square foot of warehouse space due to slow growth and a weak profit outlook that it attributed to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-21/amazon-aims-to-sublet-end-warehouse-leases-as-online-sales-cool">overbuilding</a>. Sources told Bloomberg the plan was to sublet its existing space as well as end some of the leases where it was the lessee.</p>
<p>Salesforce has also made moves to cut its real estate costs in light of the shift to hybrid working, and last year <a target="_blank" href="https://www.michigansthumb.com/bayarea/article/salesforce-cancels-office-lease-san-francisco-16015817.php" rel="nofollow">canceled the lease on an unbuilt 325,000 square foot (30,193sqm) tower</a>. In June, CEO Marc Benioff said an enforced return to the old normal would be folly, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/24/back_to_office_benioff/">saying</a>: &#34;Office mandates are never going to work.&#34;</p>
<p>An Amazon spokesperson told us: &#34;Amazon is a dynamic business and we weigh a variety of factors when deciding where to develop future sites or maintain a presence to best serve our partners and customers. We&#39;re always making adjustments to our network to best fit our business needs and improve the experience for our employees, partners, drivers and customers. While we&#39;re closing some of our older sites, we&#39;re also enhancing some of our facilities and we continue to open new sites as well. In fact, since 2020 we&#39;ve added more than 350 new modern facilities to our network in the US alone and have dozens more facilities under construction here in the US and around the world.&#34; Â®</p>
