Mr Mangione was named as the valedictorian, typically the student with the highest academic achievements in a class.<!-- --></p><p>A former classmate, Freddie Leatherbury, told the Associated Press news agency that Mr Mangione came from a wealthy family, even by that private school&#39;s standards.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;Quite honestly, he had everything going for him,&#34; Mr Leatherbury said.<!-- --></p><p>Mr Mangione is also a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degree in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. <!-- --></p><p>A friend who attended the Ivy League college at the same time as Mr Mangione described him as a &#34;super normal&#34; and &#34;smart person&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>Mr Mangione worked as a data engineer for TrueCar, a digital retailing website for new and used cars, according to his social media profiles.

He also had a suppressor. <!-- --></p><p>Police said he was carrying several IDs, including one with his real identity and another that was fake. These IDs included a US passport and a fraudulent New Jersey ID that was used to check into the New York City hostel, where the suspect was seen before the shooting<!-- --></p><p>Police say he was also found with three pages of handwritten documents in which he seemed to express &#34;ill will towards corporate America&#34;.<!-- --></p><p>Investigators revealed that finding the 26-year-old was a complete surprise, and that they did not have his name on a list of suspects prior before Monday.<!-- --></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Social media profiles provide some possible clues about Mr Mangione&#39;s thinking. <!-- --></p><p>A person matching his name and photo had an account on Goodreads, a user-generated book review site, where he gave four stars to a text called Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski â€“ more popularly known as the Unabomber manifesto. <!-- --></p><p>Starting in 1978, Kaczynski carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people and injured dozens of others, until he was arrested in 1996.<!-- --></p><p>In his review, Mr Mangione wrote: &#34;When all other forms of communication fail, violence is necessary to survive. You may not like his methods, but to see things from his perspective, it&#39;s not terrorism, it&#39;s war and revolution.<!-- --></p><p>&#34;&#39;Violence never solved anything&#39; is a statement uttered by cowards and predators.&#34;<!-- --></p></div></div>
