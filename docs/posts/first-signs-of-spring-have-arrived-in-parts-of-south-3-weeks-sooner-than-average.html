The First Leaf and First Bloom Indices are synthetic measures of these early season events in plants, based on recent temperature conditions. These models allow us to track the progression of spring onset across the country. </p><h2>How does this spring compare to &#34;normal&#34;?</h2><p><a title="Map showing the spring first leaf index anomaly" href="https://www.usanpn.org/files/npn/maps/six-leaf-index-daily-anomaly-2023.gif" rel="lightbox"><img src="https://www.usanpn.org/files/npn/maps/six-leaf-index-daily-anomaly-2023.gif" alt="Map showing the spring first leaf index anomaly" title="Spring First Leaf Index Anomaly" width="350" height="187"/></a></p><p><a title="Map showing the spring first bloom index anomaly" href="https://www.usanpn.org/files/npn/maps/six-bloom-index-daily-anomaly-2023.gif" rel="lightbox"><img src="https://www.usanpn.org/files/npn/maps/six-bloom-index-daily-anomaly-2023.gif" alt="Map showing the spring first bloom index anomaly" title="Spring First Bloom Index Anomaly" width="350" height="187"/></a></p><p><em>January 23, 2023</em></p><p>Spring leaf out conditions have arrived in southern states. Spring is up to three weeks earlier than average (the period of 1991-2020) in parts of Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina. Austin, TX is 9 days early, Jackson, MS is 12 days early, and Charleston, SC is 10 days early. In central Florida, spring is 1-2 days later than average.</p><p>Spring bloom has also arrived in the southernmost parts of Texas and Florida. Spring bloom is 8-12 days early in Texas and on time to a few days early in Florida. </p><p>When will spring arrive at your location?

Maps for the current year are generated using temperature products from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Prediction <a title="NOAA Real-time mesoscale analysis" href="http://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/rtma/" target="_blank">Real-Time Mesoscale Analysis</a>. More information is provided in our <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2017/1003/ofr20171003.pdf" target="_blank">Gridded Product Documentation</a>.</p><p>To determine how the current spring compares to “normal”, we difference the day of year the leaf out or bloom was reached this year from the long-term average (1991-2020) day of year it was met. Long-term averages were calculated using <a title="PRISM Climate Data website" href="http://www.prism.oregonstate.edu/">PRISM Climate Data</a> daily minimum/maximum temperature data (Oregon State University).</p><p>In 2022, we updated the period of comparison for our spring leaf out and bloom anomaly maps to the new climate normal of 1991-2020, following standards set by <a title="NOAA new climate normals" href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/noaa-delivers-new-us-climate-normals" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/news/noaa-delivers-new-us-climate-normals&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1647040179731000&amp;usg=AOvVaw06m8WBFJOblwU4gclpCXm0">NOAA</a> and the World Meteorological Organization. <a title="Climate Central new climate normals" href="https://medialibrary.climatecentral.org/resources/changing-seasonal-normals" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://medialibrary.climatecentral.org/resources/changing-seasonal-normals&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1647040179731000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0rsQSemSd_MGahfv4PWoMo">Climate Central</a> offers more detail about how seasonal average temperatures have shifted from the prior to the current climate normal period.</p><p>To calculate how often we see a spring as early or late as the current spring, we compare the current year&#39;s Spring Index Anomaly value to the anomaly values from the previous decades. We determine how often a spring was at least this early (or late) by taking the number of years in the record divided by the count of years that were earlier (or later) than the current year.</p><h3>Re-use of Maps and Data</h3><p><img src="https://www.usanpn.org/files/npn/si-x/USA-NPN-logo-RGB.png" alt="USA National Phenology Network" title="USA-NPN Logo" width="194" height="60"/>   </p></div></div></div>  </div>
