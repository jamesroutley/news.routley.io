    <h1>I need structure in my life</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>I&#39;ve come across a lot of productivity and self-help resources and all of them suggest setting up a routine.</p>
<p>Maybe the reason why I can&#39;t get things done and get overwhelmed so easily is that I don&#39;t have a morning routine or a daily routine in general.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t get out of bed at a certain fixed time, although my alarm is set to go off at 5:30 AM. I usually just listen to my body if I need more rest.</p>
<p>Some days I eat breakfast, some days I don&#39;t. Some days the first thing I do is drink coffee and spend time with my family, other times I just go straight to work (on my laptop).</p>
<p>Some days I take naps at lunchtime, other times I need to go out and do some errands.</p>
<p>Maybe this is really why most of the things I scheduled to do for the week don&#39;t get followed.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have a structure.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll work on this week and share with you updates on this blog.</p>
