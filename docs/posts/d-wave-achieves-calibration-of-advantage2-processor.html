                            <p><em>New processor delivers exceptional performance gains over current Advantage system with doubled coherence and 40% increase in energy scale for advanced problem solving</em></p>
<p><strong>PALO ALTO, Calif. – November 6, 2024</strong> – D-Wave Quantum Inc. (NYSE: QBTS) (“D-Wave” or the “Company”), a leader in quantum computing systems, software, and services and the world’s first commercial supplier of quantum computers, today announced that it has completed the calibration and benchmarking of a 4,400+ qubit Advantage2™ processor. This milestone marks a significant step forward in D-Wave’s ongoing development of its sixth-generation annealing quantum computing system. The latest Advantage2 processor shows substantial performance gains over the current Advantage<sup>TM</sup> system in solving customers’ complex computational problems in areas such as optimization, AI, and materials science.</p>
<p>Recent performance benchmarks demonstrate that the 4,400+ qubit Advantage2 processor is computationally more powerful than the current Advantage system, solving a range of problems – including 3D lattice problems common in materials science – 25,000 times faster. The processor also delivers five times better solutions on problems requiring a high degree of precision. Furthermore, it surpasses the current Advantage system in 99% of tests on satisfiability problems, highlighting its capabilities across a wide range of quantum applications.</p>
<p>Compared with the current Advantage system, the 4,400+ qubits Advantage2 processor delivers significant improvements in:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Qubit coherence time:</strong> doubled, which drives faster time to solution</li>
<li><strong>Energy scale: </strong>increased by 40% to deliver higher-quality solutions</li>
<li><strong>Qubit connectivity­­­: </strong>increased from 15 to 20-way connectivity to enable solutions to larger problems</li>
</ul>
<p>“Our strategic decision to focus development efforts on enhancing the connectivity and coherence of our next annealing quantum computing system has proven successful,” said Trevor Lanting, chief development officer at D-Wave. “We’re thrilled with the performance of our recently calibrated processor, and we believe this technology will deliver amazing results for our customers, solving bigger and more complex problems.”</p>
