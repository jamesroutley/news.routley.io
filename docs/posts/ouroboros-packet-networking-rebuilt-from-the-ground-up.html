			Ouroboros is a <b>peer-to-peer
packet network prototype</b>. It unifies all packet communications
–whether it is two programs the same machine or a set of programs in
computers on different continents – using a small set of
abstractions, which we call <b>layers</b> and <b>flows</b>. The
Ouroboros architecture improves security, privacy and efficiency
through <b>simplicity</b>. It provides a very
<b>compact API</b> for writing distributed software and networked
application libraries, with support for both <b>unicast</b>
and <b>multicast</b> communications. Being rebuilt from the ground up,
Ouroboros is not directly compatible with IP or UNIX sockets, but it
can run on top of and/or below <b>UDP/IP and Ethernet</b>.
