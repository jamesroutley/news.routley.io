Well, several reasons. But first of all, the deck was really stacked against Indonesia in a number of ways.</p><h4>Difficult geography, difficult history</h4><p>First of all, Indonesia is geographically huge and fragmented. Its land area is only about a fifth that of the U.S., but it stretches across a vast area.</p><p>This inherently makes it hard for people to move around the country. It also creates differences in the demand for public goods, which tends to paralyze governments. </p><p><span>An even bigger factor affecting the latter is the size and diversity of Indonesia’s population. With 274 million people, Indonesia is the fourth largest country on Earth (the U.S. is third at 330 million). And this enormous population is made up of an absolutely </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Indonesia" rel="">dizzying array of ethnic groups</a><span> — 1340, by the official count.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d7c57f-e030-4d6d-adde-4eaf58508687_1920x783.png"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d7c57f-e030-4d6d-adde-4eaf58508687_1920x783.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d7c57f-e030-4d6d-adde-4eaf58508687_1920x783.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d7c57f-e030-4d6d-adde-4eaf58508687_1920x783.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d7c57f-e030-4d6d-adde-4eaf58508687_1920x783.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d7c57f-e030-4d6d-adde-4eaf58508687_1920x783.png" width="1456" height="594" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/92d7c57f-e030-4d6d-adde-4eaf58508687_1920x783.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:594,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:516910,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;By Gunawan Kartapranata - Own work based on the map in Ethnography Room, National Museum of Indonesia, Jakarta, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11485259&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true}" alt="By Gunawan Kartapranata - Own work based on the map in Ethnography Room, National Museum of Indonesia, Jakarta, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11485259" title="By Gunawan Kartapranata - Own work based on the map in Ethnography Room, National Museum of Indonesia, Jakarta, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=11485259" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d7c57f-e030-4d6d-adde-4eaf58508687_1920x783.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d7c57f-e030-4d6d-adde-4eaf58508687_1920x783.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d7c57f-e030-4d6d-adde-4eaf58508687_1920x783.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F92d7c57f-e030-4d6d-adde-4eaf58508687_1920x783.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></a></figure></div><p><span>A large population has its advantages and disadvantages (</span><a href="https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty_pages/romain.wacziarg/downloads/2005_handbook.pdf" rel="">see here for a great list</a><span>, with research links).

As </span><a href="https://wcfia.harvard.edu/files/wcfia/files/alesina_artificialstates.pdf" rel="">Alesina et al. (2006) showed</a><span>, European empires often created “artificial” states by lumping a bunch of ethnic groups together within fairly arbitrary borders, and this practice tended to lead to a bunch of ethnic conflict that made it hard for these countries to grow (at least, for a while). Indonesia somewhat fits this bill — much of it used to be part of various Javanese empires (Java being the most populous island in the archipelago), but the modern state is a creation of Dutch colonialists. </span></p><p><span>As one might expect from this history, the country has </span><a href="https://asiasociety.org/causes-conflict-indonesia" rel="">often been riven</a><span> by </span><a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/36695557.pdf" rel="">ethnic conflict</a><span>, and there’s still some of this today. The most severe right now is the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_conflict" rel="">Papua Conflict</a><span>, a low-level civil war between the government and a separatist movement. </span></p><p><span>Indonesia’s post-colonial history is violent and turbulent.

In 1998 there was </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia" rel="">a huge series of riots</a><span> against ethnic Chinese people, which ended up toppling the country’s dictator at the time. </span></p><p><span>Given its natural challenges and this bloody and chaotic history, it’s all the more remarkable that Indonesia is now one of the freest and most democratic in its region, with </span><a href="https://freedomhouse.org/countries/freedom-world/scores" rel="">a higher Freedom House ranking</a><span> than Malaysia, the Philippines, or Singapore. Since the fall of the dictator Suharto in 1998, the country has had </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_Indonesia" rel="">four peaceful transitions of power</a><span> (though one of these was an impeachment of a president who tried to dissolve the parliament).

In a world growing steadily darker, Indonesia has bucked the trend.

Roughly speaking, there are two types of developing countries — natural resource exporters and industrial exporters. The former typically have all kinds of problems — political dysfunction, overvalued currency, vulnerability to resource price swings, and so on.

Why did Indonesia go in for manufacturing and then turn back? </span><a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/54055/1/669168718.pdf" rel="">Here is a good overview of the relevant history</a><span> by Aswicahyono et al., and </span><a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/BRI-Project_RP07_en.pdf" rel="">here is another</a><span> by Puspitawati. </span></p><p><span>Industrialization started in the 1960s. Suharto, a military dictator, came to power after the upheavals and bloodshed of 1965-66. In the late 60s, like many other authoritarian modernizers in Asia, he attempted to establish political legitimacy by </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order_(Indonesia)#Economy" rel="">promoting rapid economic growth</a><span>. Encouraged by a group of Berkeley-trained economists, Suharto invested in infrastructure and education, stabilized the macroeconomy, and promoted free trade and entrepreneurship. </span></p><p><span>At first Suharto’s policies mainly benefitted the agricultural sector, but by the late 70s, Indonesian manufacturing </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/app5.295" rel="">began to ramp up</a><span>. Though Indonesia did maintain a significant role for state-owned enterprises — especially in natural resources and simple primary industries — foreign investment in manufacturing became significant. (Note that this is a challenge to </span><a href="https://hajoonchang.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ABCDE2009-Changpaper.pdf" rel="">the theories of Ha-Joon Chang</a><span>, who sees manufacturing FDI as a liability.) By the 1980s, Indonesia was becoming a powerhouse in exactly the kind of labor-intensive light manufacturing industries that countries are supposed to do early on in their arc of industrialization — clothes, fabrics, electronics assembly, and so on. Remember America’s collective freakout in the early 1990s over </span><a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1992/08/the-new-free-trade-heel/" rel="">Nike’s “sweatshop” factories</a><span>? That was Indonesia! </span></p><p>Then everything came crashing to a halt in the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997. Indonesia was hit hard, and the resulting turmoil ended up throwing the dictator out of power. Indonesia’s democracy had begun, but its industrialization stalled. In particular, Aswicahyono et al. note that before the crisis, it was common for small manufacturing companies in Indonesia to become big companies, but this scaling-up process stopped after 1997-8:</p><blockquote><p>Thus the crisis and its immediate aftermath appear to have marked a turning point in this process of firm mobility. Until the crisis, smaller firms continued to display the dynamism evident in the pre-crisis period. However, after the crisis, the pace of graduation slowed, and the small firm share in both series declined.</p></blockquote><p><span>The authors blame financial constraints, which is plausible given how hard the crisis hit the country’s banking system. But starting in the early 2000s, there was another factor, which Aswicahyono et al. mention only briefly — the rise of China. If you were a multinational company who wanted to make shoes cheaply in 1991, you went to Indonesia; in 2003, you went to China. FDI into Indonesia </span><a href="https://uknowledge.uky.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1072&amp;context=mpampp_etds" rel="">recovered and even accelerated</a><span> in the mid and late 2000s, but much was now flowing into resource-extractive industries.

Trade liberalization — which continued after Suharto’s fall, with prodding from the IMF — meant that Indonesia could always find </span><em>something</em><span> to sell to the countries around it, even if its comparative advantage shifted from manufacturing to logging and mining. </span></p><p><span>But in the long term, it’s still no good to have an economy based mainly on logging and mining, for several reasons. First, no country has ever reached the ranks of the developed nations that way, except for a few small petrostates. Second, eventually </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_in_Indonesia" rel="">you start running out</a><span> of easily accessible trees and rocks.

The pandemic has disrupted everything, of course, so it’ll be a while before the smoke clears. But before Covid, there were indications that </span><a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3014392/indonesia-benefiting-chinas-shoemakers-shift-production-us" rel="">Indonesia was benefitting</a><span> from the U.S.-China trade war, as producers looked to diversify outside China.

Beyond those political pressures, it’s also the case that Chinese manufacturing wages have risen tremendously, to the point where China is much less competitive in labor-intensive industries than in the 2000s.</span></p><p><span>Indonesia might thus see a return to the manufacturing heyday of the 1980s and early 1990s, if it plays its cards right. </span><a href="https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/481506/policies-manufacturing-sector-indonesia-2020-2014.pdf" rel="">This lengthy 2019 report</a><span> by the Asian Development Bank and Indonesia’s National Development Planning Agency has a long list of policy suggestions to revive the manufacturing sector.

Indonesia has already partially industrialized, democratized, and then maintained steady growth despite substantial deindustrialization.
