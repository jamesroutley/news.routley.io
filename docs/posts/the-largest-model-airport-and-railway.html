Bags are loaded onto planes. In the terminal, people sip coffee, wait for their flight and reunite with loved ones in arrivals.</span></p><p><span>An Emirates A380 readies for takeoff, accelerating before soaring into the clouds. A crowd of onlookers gasps in delight as the superjumbo disappears out of sight.</span></p><p><span>No, they&#39;re not plane spotters -- or at least not in the traditional sense, because this isn&#39;t a real airport. The airplanes are fake. The clouds are painted. The airport spans just 1,614 square feet.</span></p><p><span>Welcome to <a href="https://www.miniatur-wunderland.com/" target="_blank">Miniatur Wunderland</a>. This is the world&#39;s largest model railway, home not only to a functioning miniature airport, but also tiny replicas of some of the world&#39;s most popular destinations: Venice, Machu Picchu and Las Vegas, to name just a few.</span></p><p><span>Spread across several stories in an old warehouse building in Hamburg, Germany, Miniatur Wunderland is a marvel of engineering and one of the German city&#39;s most beloved tourist attractions. </span></p><p><span>Its crown jewel is its airport -- a painstaking recreation of Hamburg&#39;s real transport hub, complete with 52 moving aircraft, carefully painted with livery to match their real-life, larger counterparts.</span></p><p><span>Miniatur Wunderland is the vision of twin brothers Frederik Braun and Gerrit Braun. Once upon a time the pair ran a nightclub, but a childhood spent playing with model trains sowed the seed of an idea that returned to Frederik in 2000.</span></p><p><span>Frederik recalls phoning his brother and telling him, &#34;I have the greatest idea.&#34;</span></p><p><span>Gerrit was on board right away.</span></p><p><span>&#34;We had the dream to build a very large model world in childhood, but we forgot this dream when we were 15 or 16 years old -- girls, cars and everything else came into our life,&#34; Gerrit tells <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel" target="_blank">CNN Travel.</a></span></p><p><span>As soon as Frederik spoke the words aloud, this childhood vision came rushing back to Gerrit.</span></p><p><span>&#34;It took seconds. All the pictures from our childhood -- and what we could do today -- came into my mind,&#34; he says. &#34;And these pictures were not standing still. It was movement. It was life. Lights turning on and off, trains running, planes moving and flying...&#34; </span></p><p><span>Within weeks, the brothers were sketching out on ideas. Within months, they&#39;d signed the lease on a building in Hamburg&#39;s port district.</span></p><p><span>Frederik and Gerrit were convinced the idea had legs. But there were plenty of naysayers.</span></p><p><span>&#34;Many, many people around me said to me, &#39;No, it can&#39;t work. Model trains? That&#39;s for old men,&#39;&#34; says Frederik.</span></p><p><span>But Miniatur Wunderland had mass appeal, becoming a word of mouth hit when it opened in August 2000.</span></p><p><span>&#34;It is an exhibition for the whole family, for each person, one to 100 years, women, men, does not make a difference,&#34; says Frederik.</span></p><p><span><h3>Designing a mini version of our world</h3></span></p><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F220819154740-01-body-worlds-largest-model-railway-airport-fred-gerrit.jpg" alt="For brothers Frederik and Gerrit Braun, creating Miniatur Wunderland was a dream come true."/></p><p>For brothers Frederik and Gerrit Braun, creating Miniatur Wunderland was a dream come true.</p><p>Miniatur Wunderland Hamburg</p></div><p><span>Before opening Miniatur Wunderland&#39;s doors, Frederik, Gerrit and their third co-founder, friend Stephan Hertz, sat down and made a list of all the scenes they&#39;d like to see play out in miniature form.</span></p><p><span>The next step was hunting out a model builder who could help bring their dream to life. An internet search led them to skilled German modelist Gerhard Dauscher.</span></p><p><span>Dauscher initially turned down the opportunity as he was fully booked with work for the next two years.</span></p><p><span>&#34;Two days later, he called me,&#34; recalls Frederik. Dauschler couldn&#39;t shake the idea from his mind. He rejigged his schedule and joined the team.</span></p><p><span>Speaking to CNN Travel today, Dauscher says Miniatur Wunderland appealed to his longtime love of railways. He was also excited about the prospect of creating fantasy versions of our reality.</span></p><p><span>In the two decades since, the Miniatur Wunderland team has grown to over 250 employees, include a skilled team of model builders who constantly plot new ways to thrill and delight visitors. </span></p><p><span>&#34;Everyone has built some part of the layout, everyone feels like a little bit of [them], [their] heart, is in the layout,&#34; says Dauscher.</span></p><p><span>There are also electricians on hand, and a team of technicians keeping tabs on day-to-day happenings from an in-house control room.</span></p><p><span>Frederik and Gerrit&#39;s younger brother Sebastian Drechsler is also on board. Drechsler is over a decade younger than the twins, and says his childhood was mostly spent accidentally destroying his older brothers&#39; model railways.</span></p><p><span>Today, Drechsler is in charge of Miniatur Wunderland&#39;s marketing. Meanwhile Frederik is the dreamer, and Gerrit is the doer.</span></p><p><span>&#34;Freddy always had the big ideas, and I always had the solutions to make these ideas,&#34; is how Gerrit puts it.</span></p><p><span><h3>Building a model airport</h3></span></p><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F220819151145-04-worlds-largest-model-railway-airport.jpg" alt="The airport at Miniatur Wunderland is a recreation of the real Hamburg Airport."/></p><p>The airport at Miniatur Wunderland is a recreation of the real Hamburg Airport.</p><p>Miniatur Wunderland Hamburg</p></div><p><span>Perhaps Frederik&#39;s most ambitious idea was Miniatur Wunderland&#39;s airport, which opened in 2011. This expansion took almost six years to construct, costing €400,000 (about $400,150). The finished result incorporates 62 miles of wiring, 75 buildings and 40,000 LED lights.</span></p><p><span>Unlike most of the landscapes in Miniatur Wunderland, which are approximations of their real-life counterparts, the airport is an exact replica of Hamburg&#39;s real aviation hub.</span></p><p><span>Gerrit explains this is partly because it was easier to copy the airport layout and then scale it down than it would have been to &#34;learn everything about aircraft, how they move on the ground, what are the spaces they need.&#34;</span></p><p><span>Gerrit spent four months making regular visits to Hamburg Airport, talking to workers and taking thousands of photos to use as inspiration.</span></p><p><span>Creating realistic aircraft and simulating takeoff and landing was a key focus, but Gerrit also talked to the airport fire brigade, airport cleaners and the team who defrost the aircraft.</span></p><p><span>&#34;We wanted it to have a real atmosphere of the airport,&#34; explains model builder Dauscher. That meant recreating every aspect of the transport hub.</span></p><p><span>When CNN Travel visited the attraction, a &#34;fire&#34; broke out at the airport, and the airport fire trucks stepped in -- all part of the simulation, of course, but it was momentarily concerning to see an airplane go up in smoke.</span></p><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F220819151312-05-worlds-largest-model-railway-airport.jpg" alt="The airport includes a detailed recreation of the terminal building."/></p><p>The airport includes a detailed recreation of the terminal building.</p><p>Miniatur Wunderland Hamburg</p></div><p><span>The Miniatur Wunderland aircraft range from A380s to Cessna private jets, and are designed to take off and land in a way that feels as &#34;real&#34; as possible.</span></p><p><span>&#34;They drive to the runway, and from under the construction come two pipes, they lift up the plane and give them speed. It&#39;s very complicated, technical,&#34; explains Dauscher.</span></p><p><span>Much of the happenings in Miniatur Wunderland, including the airplane takeoff and landings and the regular lighting shift to simulate day turning to night, are automated.</span></p><p><span>Dauscher explains the technicians in the control room are mostly focused on checking for -- and then fixing -- any errors. The most common cause of errors? Dust.</span></p><p><span>&#34;The more dust we have on the surface, the trains don&#39;t run, the airplanes don&#39;t fly,&#34; says Dauscher.</span></p><p><span>Over a decade since it launched, the airport remains a highlight of Miniatur Wunderland. The only issue, says Gerrit, is whenever anything changes at Hamburg Airport -- even if it&#39;s just the position of the taxi rank -- the team feels pressure to change their model to match. </span></p><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F220819151219-02-worlds-largest-model-railway-airport.jpg" alt="The Miniatur Wunderland team want to thrill and delight visitors with their detailed creations."/></p><p>The Miniatur Wunderland team want to thrill and delight visitors with their detailed creations.</p><p>Miniatur Wunderland Hamburg</p></div><p><span>Still, nothing at Miniatur Wunderland is static -- it&#39;s a constantly evolving attraction.</span></p><p><span>The Miniatur Wunderland South America expansion continues to grow, and is set to be complete within the next five years with the addition of a mini Amazon rainforest and Andes mountain range. Miniatur Wunderland also plans to expand to another building to aid future growth.</span></p><p><span>As well as holding the Guinness World Record for world&#39;s largest model railway and world&#39;s largest model airport, Miniatur Wunderland also set a record in 2021 for the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/travel/2021/04/08/longest-melody-played-by-model-train-na-lon-orig.cnn" target="_blank">longest melody played by a model train.</a></span></p><p><span><h3>Exploring worlds</h3></span></p><div><p><img src="https://dynaimage.cdn.cnn.com/cnn/e_blur:500,q_auto:low,w_50,c_fill,g_auto,h_28,ar_16:9/http%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cnn.com%2Fcnnnext%2Fdam%2Fassets%2F220819151238-06-worlds-largest-model-railway-airport.jpg" alt="Miniatur Wunderland&#39;s most recent expansion is its South America section."/></p><p>Miniatur Wunderland&#39;s most recent expansion is its South America section.</p><p>Miniatur Wunderland Hamburg</p></div><p><span>Miniatur Wunderland stays open open until 1.a.m. on certain days in summer. When CNN Travel visited at 8.p.m. on a summer weekday evening, the attraction was packed with visitors pointing out tiny details and marveling at the different worlds.</span></p><p><span>Gerrit suggests the appeal of Miniatur Wunderland is that it&#39;s not just the culmination of the Braun brothers&#39; childhood ambitions. It&#39;s the model world many of us dreamed of creating as a kid.</span></p><p><span>&#34;[Visitors can] spend two or three nice hours reminded of their childhood,&#34; says Gerrit.</span></p><p><span>Certainly walking through the building is pure escapism. The appeal lies in the mix of whimsy and technical prowess.</span></p><p><span>There are over 1,000 trains which vary in size and speed depending on location. There are also mining caves, cruise ships that cross real pools of water and a hot air balloon. And there are thousands of tiny figures and almost imperceptible levels of detail. Wherever you are in the building, there&#39;s something thrilling about peering down at the world with a bird&#39;s eye view.</span></p><p><span>That&#39;s Frederik&#39;s favorite part of the attraction. Standing and looking down below.</span></p><p><span>&#34;The night is coming and you close your eyes a little bit, you can imagine it&#39;s like flying through the mountains,&#34; he says.</span></p></div></div></div>
