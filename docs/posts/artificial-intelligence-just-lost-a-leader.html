<p>Roger Schank just passed away. Roger was a top leader of AI. I overlapped with him for my time at Yale. In 1974, he became a professor of computer science and psychology at Yale University. In 1981, Schank became Chairman of Computer Science at Yale and director of the Yale Artificial Intelligence Project. I was gone by then off to Berkeley.</p>

<p>John Brockman <a href="https://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/schank/schank_index.html#:~:text=Roger%20Schank%20is%20a%20computer,to%20deconstruct%20the%20human%20mind.">wrote</a>: He is a computer scientist and cognitive psychologist who has worked in the AI field for twenty-five years. Like Marvin Minsky, he takes the strong AI view, but rather than trying to build an intelligent machine he wants to deconstruct the human mind. He wants to know, in particular, how natural language— one’s mother tongue — is processed, how memory works, and how learning occurs. Schank thinks of the human mind as a learning device, and he thinks that it is being taught in the wrong way. He is something of a gadfly; he deplores the curriculum-based, drill-oriented methods in today’s schools, and his most recent contributions have been in the area of education, looking at ways to use computers to enhance the learning process.</p>
<p><strong>Roger’s View</strong></p>
<p>Roger was a scary guy—especially for junior theory faculty like me. I did get along with Roger and he did support me when I was up for tenure. But he was scary no matter what. Part of the issue was that Roger did not think much of any research that was not AI based. Theory was not a top issue in his view.</p>
<p><strong>Beat Roger Out</strong></p>
<p>At Yale once Schank walked into Alan Perlis’s office and told Alan that he had thought about some post-doc position we had funding for. Schank began to explain to Perlis that he, Roger, had a couple of ideas of who he planned to hire to fill this position—of course the position was his. Perlis waved him off and said,</p>
<p><em>Lipton already has found a candidate and the position is gone.</em></p>
<p>I was not there, so all this is second-hand from Perlis, but I can imagine that Roger was not pleased—in his mind all resources of the department should have gone to build up the AI group. Roger was initially upset, but after this event he acted differently toward me. He treated me with more respect—in general theory was not his type of research. I always thought that he respected someone who “beat” him at the resource game, since he was such a strong player. I probably should not do it again, but doing it once was cool.</p>
<p>Years later, after Roger had moved to Northwestern University, he tried hard to hire me. Perhaps I should have gone. Oh well.</p>
<p><strong>Open Problems</strong></p>
