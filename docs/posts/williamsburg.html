      <p>This post is just meant as a quick update for everyone who follows this blog. Sorry I&#39;ve been so inactive lately, I was really busy preparing for the Recurse Center. This meant finalizing all of the cooperations with my clients—handovers, meetings, evaluations, etc.—, seeing all of my friends before I leave—I think the last two weeks have been more dense in dates than any time in my life—, and the usual packing and organizing.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;m in Williamsburg. I&#39;m staying at Hewes Street on broadway, meaning I&#39;m almost in Bushwick and I&#39;m hearing the subway constantly, but I&#39;m extremely happy. I&#39;ve only been here since Friday, but I&#39;ve been productive, seen a lot of the area, and bonded with my new roommates, so I couldn&#39;t be more <a href="#1">content</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;m looking forward to starting the Recurse Center tomorrow, because the introductions of my fellow recursers were amazing and inspiring and I&#39;m really stoked to meet them. To all of y&#39;all at home, I love you and I miss you. You&#39;re the best. To a great three months!</p>
