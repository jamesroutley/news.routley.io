<p>I’m in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> this week <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/muni-public-transportation-San-Francisco-17656590.php">arguing for more
investment in
Muni</a>,
to fund increased service and pilot fare-free rides.</p>

<p>To briefly summarize my op-ed: I argue that while <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/projects/slow-streets-program">Slow
Streets</a>, the
<a href="https://sfrecpark.org/1538/JFK-Promenade">JFK Promenade</a>, and the
weekend use of the Great Highway as a car-free <a href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/sf-supervisors-seal-great-highways-fate--for-now/article_f5afab98-759d-11ed-b34f-efe8146882c7.html">Great Highway
Park</a>
represent progress worth celebrating, San Francisco is still moving in
the wrong direction overall when it comes to transportation. Biking is
up a little. (Parents biking kids to school on cargo bikes seems to
have exploded in popularity.) But the share of car trips has seen a
greater increase than that of bike trips, and public transit usage has
fallen in the latest <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/blog/how-people-traveled-through-san-francisco-2021-0">SFMTA
survey</a>.
The missing element is full-throated political support—including an
ambitious vision and strong funding—for Muni, which has failed to
fully restore prepandemic service (exacerbating existing deficiencies
on the west side), and which makes it hard to fill up your Clipper
card if you travel among outlying neighborhoods and aren’t going
downtown every day.</p>

<p>I wrote <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/muni-public-transportation-San-Francisco-17656590.php">my
op-ed</a>
for a general audience. Here’s a bonus post for transit nerds, wonks,
and urbanists.</p>

<p>There’s a certain element in the urbanist community that’s afraid of
free fares, and I think it’s important for transit advocates to move
past this fear. Public transit is a public service, not a business.
It’s misguided to treat it like a business, as free-fare skeptics do
when they assert that more money spent on replacing fare revenue means
less money spent on running more transit vehicles and building transit
infrastructure. That’s not how the political process works. As <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221220055053/https://twitter.com/yfreemark/status/1601616004638920704">Yonah
Freemark points
out</a>,
there’s:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>No evidence that support for better transit declines when there is
free transit</li>
    <li>No evidence that there is an overall max budget available for
transit</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In Washington, DC’s case, the council’s <a href="https://dcist.com/story/22/12/01/dc-council-wants-to-make-metrobus-fares-free/">proposal for fare-free
buses</a>
comes from general funds of the DC government that were not otherwise
earmarked for transit. There’s no either-or dilemma here. So anyone
who’s attacking DC’s effort—which also includes increased 24/7
service for night-shift workers—is behaving like an ideologue, not a
transit advocate.</p>

<p>This sort of either-or dilemma is never applied to car infrastructure.
Imagine if, when a driver demanded free parking, the other members of
their automobile club chewed them out: “What are you doing?  Without
our parking fees, they’re going to cut the budget for highway
building!” The car gets whatever it wants, freeways and free parking
both, because it’s taken seriously as the way the vast majority of
voters in our democracy, with the exception of the urban cores of
certain cities<sup id="fnref:elite" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:elite">1</a></sup>, get around.</p>

<p>The entire challenge is for public transportation to be equally as
popular as personal cars and taken equally seriously. It should be
obvious that increasing ridership serves this goal, and that’s what
going fare-free has done in, for example,
<a href="https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2021/11/10/boston-fare-free-bus-28-pilot-michelle-wu/">Boston</a>,
<a href="https://coloradosun.com/2022/12/01/zero-fare-colorado-air-pollution/">Denver</a>,
<a href="https://www.axios.com/local/richmond/2022/08/29/grtc-richmond-ridership">Richmond,
Va.</a>,
and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967070X21000135">two of three Chinese
cities</a>
that tried it.<sup id="fnref:muni2008" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:muni2008">2</a></sup></p>

<p>In Muni’s case, in the last fiscal year before the Covid-19 pandemic,
only 18% of SFMTA’s revenue came from fares.<sup id="fnref:munirevenue" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:munirevenue">3</a></sup> While
replacing this revenue is not trivial, it’s a relatively small lift
compared to what it will already cost to increase levels of service to
what San Francisco needs. We should do both.</p>

<p>Fares discourage the use of transit, even among people who can easily
afford them. The experience of fumbling for small bills and change
while impatient bus riders glare at you: not pleasant! Tapping a
stored-value card like Clipper is much better, but that assumes you
have one and have it filled. If you never got one, or haven’t ridden
in a while and aren’t sure if it has value or if the bus would reject
you, then the easiest thing is to just keep driving.</p>

<p>Then there’s the psychological hit that comes from paying at the point
of service. It makes a transit ride <em>feel</em> like something you want to
avoid to save money, because the charge is right up front and in your
face in a way that using a little gas (or battery power) is not.</p>

<p>And while riding transit every day is almost always cheaper than the
total cost of owning a car, that rationale goes out the window once
you <em>have</em> a car, which most U.S. households currently do, if only for
the occasional out-of-town trip or emergency. Last month, when I spent
an afternoon with the <a href="https://www.fairucnow.org/">striking University of California
workers</a>’ picket line, I heard one worker
at UCSF Mission Bay break down how commuting every day from his Albany
home costs $140 a month in gas and tolls, or $280 a month in transit
fares. He joined his fellow workers in asking the UC to make the
sustainable choice the easy choice. (And it looks like they will:
under a <a href="https://www.fairucnow.org/transit/">tentative agreement</a>, UC
will now provide free public transit passes. Generalize this to all
employers—after all, all employers benefit from the increased labor
pool access that transit gives them—and you’ve basically got free
public transit, funded by a progressive tax.)</p>

<p>Like libraries, public schools, most city parks, and firefighting
services, transit is a public service that works better without user
fees as a barrier. Fares are a legacy of transit’s history as a
descendant of for-profit streetcar companies. It’s time to shed that
encumbrance. Yes, couple free transit with improved/expanded transit,
and make sure a specific proposal is well thought out before
supporting it. But knee-jerk, ideological opposition to going
fare-free should be left in the past.</p>

<p>Freeways and curb parking spots aren’t free to build and maintain;
they’re very expensive to build and maintain. If they can be free and
we consider that routine and unremarkable, then so can transit.</p>

</ul>

<p>P.S.: New York’s great new <a href="https://www.fixthemta.org/">Fix the MTA</a>
campaign calls for both increased bus and subway frequency <em>and</em>
making the bus free. I didn’t get to mention it in my op-ed because
the campaign dropped after I submitted, but that’s exactly the kind of
“both-and” thinking that transit needs.</p>
