Airlander airships for delivery from 2026</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p><b>The company behind the Airlander airships said it has received its first commercial order from an airline group.</b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Hybrid Air Vehicles (<a href="https://www.hybridairvehicles.com/">HAV</a>) said European-based Air Nostrum Group had reserved 10 Airlander airships for delivery from 2026. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>HAV, which developed Airlander at <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-44473447">Cardington airfield</a> in Bedfordshire, is expected to begin manufacturing in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-60214845">South Yorkshire</a>.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The firm said 1,800 jobs would be created as a result of the interest.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>HAV said Airlander 10 will cut flight emissions by up to 90% for journeys across Air Nostrum&#39;s regional routes in Spain.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The airships, which stay aloft using helium and electricity, have been commissioned to seat 100 people.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>According to <a href="https://www.hybridairvehicles.com/our-aircraft/faq/">HAV&#39;s website</a>, hybrid aircraft fly due to a combination of aerodynamic lift (like an aeroplane), lifting gases (like an airship) and vectored thrust (similar to a helicopter).</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Airlander generates up to 40% of its lift from aerodynamics by the passage of air over the hull and the remainder from buoyant lift from the helium.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source,

2016</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, Kwasi Kwarteng said: &#34;Hybrid aircraft could play an important role as we transition to cleaner forms of aviation, and it is wonderful to see the UK right at the forefront of the technology&#39;s development.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Carlos Bertomeu, Air Nostrum&#39;s president, said: &#34;We are exploring each and every possible way to reduce our carbon footprint. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The Airlander 10 will drastically reduce emissions and for that reason we have made this agreement with HAV. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Sustainability, which is good news for everyone, is already a non-negotiable fact in the daily operations of commercial aviation.&#34;</p></div><div

partnership with Air Nostrum Group, as the launch airline for Airlander 10, leads the way towards that future. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;As countries like France, Denmark, Norway, Spain and the UK begin to put in place ambitious mandates for the decarbonisation of domestic and short haul flight, Hybrid Air Vehicles and Air Nostrum Group are demonstrating how we can get there - and get there soon.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>sbna</span></p><figcaption><span>Image
