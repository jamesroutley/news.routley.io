					<h2>Terms and conditions</h2>
					
					<p>Wow, you deciced to read the terms and conditions first. You rock!!</p>
					<p>This is an <a href="https://www.sherpapieces.eu" target="_blank">art project</a> by <a href="https://www.tijmenschep.com" target="_blank">Tijmen Schep</a> that shows how face detection algoritms are increasingly used to judge you. It was made as part of the European Union&#39;s <a href="https://www.project-sherpa.eu/" target="_blank">Sherpa research program</a>.</p>
					<p><strong>No personal data is sent to our server in any way.</strong> Nothing. Zilch. Nada. All the face detection algorithms will run on your own computer, in the browser.</p>
					<p>In this &#39;test&#39; your face is compared with that of all the other people who came before you. At the end of the show you can, if you want to, share some anonimized data. That will then be used to re-calculate the new average. That anonymous data is not shared any further.</p>
					<p>You can also read more about the  that this project is based on, or read the <a href="https://www.hownormalami.eu/press">press release</a>.</p>

					<h4>Language Use</h4>
					<p>This project purposefully avoids using the word &#34;Artificial Intelligence&#34;, since there is nothing intelligent about these systems. I prefer to use the terms &#34;machine learning&#34; or &#34;statistics on steroids&#34;, but I&#39;ve settled on algorithms here.</p>
					<h4>Machine Learning models</h4>
					<p>Almost all the machine learning models used were downloaded &#34;pre-trained&#34; from open source projects I found on Github. This was done to make a point: we often say we should improve biased and/or error-prone machine learning models, but the reality is that most organisations don&#39;t train their own models. Instead, they use third parties that supply machine learning services, and it&#39;s in the interest of these parties to keep their systems as generic and &#34;one size fits all&#34; as possible. And then you have the parties who just implement whatever they can get their hands on, and hope nobody asks difficult questions.</p>
					<p>The beauty scoring model was <a href="https://github.com/search?q=beauty+score&amp;type=" target="_blank">found on Github</a> (<a href="https://wikidocs.net/51484" target="_blank">this</a> or <a href="https://github.com/HCIILAB/SCUT-FBP5500-Database-Release" target="_blank">this one</a>). The models to predict age, gender and facial expression/emotion are part of <a href="https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">FaceApiJS</a>, which forms the backbone of this project. Do note that its developer <a href="https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/issues/471" target="_blank">doesn&#39;t fully divulge</a> on which photos the models were trained. Also, FaceApiJS is bad at detecting &#34;<a href="https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/issues/302" target="_blank">Asian guys</a>&#34;.</p>
					<p>I actually trained the BMI prediction algorithm myself because I couldn&#39;t find any existing models that were small enough to use online. I downloaded all the BMI prediction projects I could find on Github, and was astonished to find some of them came with vast troves of photographs. I felt firty using them, but also felt that revealing what was going on was more important. I&#39;ve documented some of the dodgy things I discovered along the way <a href="https://www.sherpapieces.eu/overview/predicting-your-bmi-from-a-just-photo-a-github-safari">in this blogpost</a>.
					</p><h4>Videos, screenshots and other visual material</h4>
					<p>The videos were mainly constructed out of public domain source material from <a href="https://videos.pexels.com" target="_blank">pexels.com</a> and <a href="https://pixabay.com/" target="_blank">Pixabay.com</a>. To the photographers who so kindly shared their work: thank you all for your wonderful generosity!</p>

					<h3>Specific sources</h3>
					<h4>Attractiveness</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/" target="_blank">TikTok</a> (front page, recorded with a screen recorder). Their practise of showing content from beautiful people is explained <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/20/03/17/2122222/tiktok-tried-to-filter-out-videos-from-ugly-poor-or-disabled-users" target="_blank">here</a>. While I couldn&#39;t confirm if TikTok does this algorithmically, Tinder actually has been <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3054871/whats-your-tinder-score-inside-the-apps-internal-ranking-system" target="_blank">on the record</a> about this practice. 
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.02459.pdf">This academic research</a> was the source of the beauty judgement interface. Another source was the <a href="http://www.hcii-lab.net/data/SCUT-FBP/EN/introduce.html">SCUT-FCB</a> dataset.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Age</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="https://www.innovatrics.com/" target="_blank">Innovatrix</a> offers surveillance systems that analyse the demographics of store visitors. The picture was downloaded form their website.
						</li>

					<h4>Gender</h4>

						<li>
							Check out <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/21/tech/ai-gender-recognition-problem/index.html" target="_blank">This article</a> if you want to understand why an algorithm that tries to sort people into just two categories can upset some people.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h4>Body Mass Index (BMI)</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The BMI prediction project that was created by researchers who work at Google can be found <a href="https://github.com/Google-Research-India-Health/face-to-bmi" target="_blank">here</a> (not anymore, they deleted it!). Although all signs point to this project being a part of Google&#39;s practise, I sent an email to the makers to verify this, and got a quick response that it was a personal project. I then changed the video to say &#34;researchers who work at Google&#34; intead of &#34;Google&#39;s health lab in India&#34;.
						</li>
						<li>
							For more juicy details I refer you to the in-depth <a href="https://www.sherpapieces.eu/overview/predicting-your-bmi-from-a-just-photo-a-github-safari">blogpost</a> mentioned earlier.
						</li>
					</ul>
				
					<h4>Life expectancy</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							There are a lof of projects on Github that explore this idea, some of them as part of (Kaggle) contests set-up by the insurance industry. After exploring how these worked, I created my own wishy-washy implementation. There is no machine learning involved here, it&#39;s just a lookup in a table of life expectancies per country, the average BMI in that country, and then a calculation on how BMI might affect that. There is very little merit in this calculation, but then again that doesn&#39;t seem to be a requirement for calling yourself a data scientist.

					<h4>Closer / Face print</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Deepcamai.com is no longer online, perhaps it was removed after the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=deepcam+face+recognition+rite+aid">scandal around Rite Aid</a>. It can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200803121605/https://deepcamai.com/how-it-works/">still be found</a> using the Internet Archive&#39;s wayback machine. The Chinese parent company Deepcam has a <a href="https://www.deepcam.com">Chinese website</a>. There is also an Australian website.  Wait, it turns out the USA company has rebranded itself to <a href="https://pdactive.com/">PDActive</a>. The website is virtually identical to the old deepcamai.com website.
						</li>
						<li>
							The visual effect that shows how the video feed is first turned into a mathematical representation based on contrast is built using <a href="https://github.com/matthewmorrone/language-generator/blob/c637202fc60455e1a3be7c3d38cd1aeb19935aa2/machine-learning/hog-descriptor/README.md">HOG descriptor</a>. The code was modified to work in the browser.

					<h4>Conclusion</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="https://jonpenney.com/research/" target="_blank">Jon Penney</a> researched how Wikipedia was used after the Snowden revelations, and noticed that pages about sensitive topics such as terrorism were visited less. <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2017/07/women-young-people-experience-the-chilling-effects-of-surveillance-at-higher-rates.html" target="_blank">Later research</a> strengthened the notion that this was caused by self-censorship.
