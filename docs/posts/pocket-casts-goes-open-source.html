<p>Automattic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580023/automattic-pocket-casts-podcast-app-tumble-wordpress">acquired Pocket Casts last July</a>, and since we’ve been tapping away trying to make the best podcast client for people who love listening to podcasts.</p>



<p>And!</p>



<p>The team has been working really hard to make those clients totally open source and available to the world, <a href="https://blog.pocketcasts.com/2022/10/19/pocket-casts-mobile-apps-are-now-open-source/">and it’s now happened</a>. You can see all the code <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-ios">behind the iOS app</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/pocket-casts-android">the Android app</a>, and modify it, make it your own, suggest a change, fix a bug, add a feature, fork it and make your own client, anything!</p>



<p>If your code gets merged into core, it’ll go out to users listening to literally <strong>millions of hours</strong> of podcasts a week. It’s also unusual to be able to peek under the hood of a consumer mobile app that is this widely used and see how it works.</p>



<p>Audio publishing and consumption is a beautiful complement to the web publishing that <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> is already so good at, and that <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> tries to nurture an ecosystem around. I love Spotify and Apple, and I hope that <a href="https://pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a> can do for podcast clients what Firefox in the early days and <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/">Chromium</a> now does for browsers — push the state of the art, be manically focused on user control, and grow a more decentralized and open web.</p>



<p>If you haven’t tried Pocket Casts yet, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/pocket-casts/id414834813">install for iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts">Android</a>, and here’s <a href="https://support.pocketcasts.com/article/opml-import/">how to import your subscriptions using a format called OPML</a>. (And wouldn’t it be nice if trying out a new social network was that easy?)</p>
