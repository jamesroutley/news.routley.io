    <h1>NCSC, GCHQ, UK Gov&#39;t expunge advice to &#34;use Apple encryption&#34;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This is some really embarrassing timing on the Home Office’s (HO’s) part: a few weeks ago when <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cgj54eq4vejo">news first broke of the HO’s demand for a backdoor in Apple ADP</a>, I pointed out to MP David Davis that the HO actually extolled use of ADP by at-risk groups:</p>

<p>That screenshot was current to that day. What I did not expect was that in the interim between then and the new revelation that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8rkpv50x01o">Apple are taking the matter to (again, secret) court</a>, the people at NCSC would <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/defending-democracy/guidance-for-high-risk-individuals">apparently rewrite the whole document, rename it, broaden the audience, and water it down</a> by eliding the advice to enable and use ADP, as discovered by Pat Walshe… or at least that’s what happened on the face of it:</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">15/ from current web pages.</p>— Privacy Matters ? (@PrivacyMatters) <a href="https://twitter.com/PrivacyMatters/status/1897242511535694253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Instead they now call for use of Apple’s “Lockdown Mode”, and I checked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/runasand_four-things-to-know-about-lockdown-mode-activity-7184158735693426688-ElOq/">noted Lockdown Mode advocate Runa Sandvik</a> who confirms for me that Lockdown Mode is a separate feature from ADP, with a different remit from cloud data protection. Enabling one does not enable the other.</p>



<p>But this is where it gets weird, because suddenly I noticed a different URL was being shown in the browser bar, and then I found that <a href="https://www.glitchcat.xyz/p/a-look-at-the-uks-cybersecurity-guidance">writing in April 2024, Runa observed some weaknesses</a> in NCSC’s (contemporary) “Defending Democracy” guidance:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Also missing are any mentions of encrypted phone backups for Android and iOS; end-to-end encryption for <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756">iCloud</a>; and end-to-end encryption for <a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/1246476872801203/">WhatsApp</a> backups. […] should also include Google’s Advanced Protection Program (and Google should mention it more too).”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So the document we are looking at <em>today</em> also existed <em>back then</em>, with the same deficiencies … which leads us to presume that <em>the politically inconvenient ADP-promoting “for barristers” document has actually been wholesale <strong>deleted from the internet</strong>, with a HTTP redirect put in place to point to the inferior “defending democracy” documents.</em></p>



<p>And lo, what do we find?</p>



<blockquote>
<p>$ curl -s -L -I -A “Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:110.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/110.0” https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/cyber-security-tips-for-barristers-solicitors-and-legal-professionals | grep location:</p>



<p>location: <strong>/collection/defending-democracy/guidance-for-high-risk-individuals</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Confirmation. So the question in my mind is: is the UK Government attempting to cover-up its previous advocacy of ADP, by censoring this old document? Or does it instead want the UK legal profession to avoid use of ADP and to what end?</p>
