    <h1>Our production servers were suspended by Google Cloud</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>The last 24 hours has been tough. As a 4 years customer, our production servers have been suspended by Google Cloud because we didn&#39;t fill up some information on-time.</p><p>To be clear, it has been more than 24 hours and they still have not got back with a resolution. <strong>I managed to get our servers back online few hours ago</strong> with a workaround by adding a new billing account.</p><h3>Why were our servers suspended? Because we didn&#39;t fill up information in time?</h3><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61fa897ae8bdd6751f64613c/640bc8f9d086fdecebaa7f58_onRvNd6.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>1) Google Cloud dropped us an email 10 days back that I missed out</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61fa897ae8bdd6751f64613c/640bc9176bc21168556cd1d4_pQfRveI.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>2) Titled &#34;Important Information Regarding Your Google Account&#34; with no indication of suspension or what in title. Basically you would have thought it was an informational email that doesn&#39;t require any action on your part.</p><p>3) Given the number of subprocessor &#34;Important&#34; emails they send it&#39;s too easy to miss out the email.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61fa897ae8bdd6751f64613c/640bc84d6bc211244b6ccc91_WNavXnB.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>4) So 10 days gone by and our servers were abruptly shutdown with no suspension notification. They simply pulled the plug.</p><p>So what information are we missing?</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/61fa897ae8bdd6751f64613c/640bccc717d12b43e4775840_screenshot-support.google.com-2023.03.11-07_48_35.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The form can be viewed <a href="https://support.google.com/googlepay/contact/account_verification?visit_id=638140850059852730-3945470479&amp;rd=1">here</a>. Basically they want us to provide identification documents. For us, we&#39;ve already been paying and using the same credit card for the past 4 yrs. Only changed once when the card expire few months back but weren&#39;t told to provide any identification documents previously.</p><h3>Google Cloud have zero empathy for customers</h3><p>We&#39;ve always pay our bills on-time for the past 4 yrs consistently spending $400-$700/mo. Our servers were suspended not because of any fradulent related issue. It was suspended simply because of <strong>&#34;some missing paperwork&#34;</strong> that has been delayed. Since we were told to wait 24-48 hrs for their &#34;trust and safety&#34; team to verify our documents, I asked the support to at least temporarily reactivate our servers given the circumstances. But the support told us they have no access to do so.</p><p><strong>As of now, we are still waiting for them to reply. And if I haven&#39;t found a workarond, our servers would&#39;ve been down for more than 24 hrs</strong>. It&#39;s beyond ridiculous how they treat the very customer who trusted them since the App Engine days. And it&#39;s obvious that their &#34;trust and safety&#34; team doesn&#39;t care or understand the urgentness of the matter. </p><h3>Moving Forward</h3><p>Starting today, I will be making plans to move everything to AWS. It will take awhile since we have tons of code to change and also commitment usage with Google Cloud. But I will <strong>never ever run any production stuffs with Google Cloud again. You can&#39;t trust them with your business.</strong></p><h3>How to get information updates for OnVoard?</h3><p>In this case we weren&#39;t able to broadcast email to everyone since we use our own platform for sending emails.
