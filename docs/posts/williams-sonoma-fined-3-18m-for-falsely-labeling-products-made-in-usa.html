    <h1>Williams-Sonoma fined $3.18M for falsely labeling products &#39;Made in USA&#39;</h1>

        <div><p>Williams-Sonoma could be paying a hefty fine for claiming a small chunk of its products were &#34;Made in USA&#34; when they weren&#39;t.</p><p>In a federal court filing on Monday, the Federal Trade Commission asked a judge to sign an order that would fine the luxury home goods company $3.18 million for violating a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2020/07/ftc-approves-final-order-settling-charges-williams-sonoma-inc-made-overly-broad-misleading-made-usa" data-cms-ai="0">2020 order</a> regarding the same false label claims. Williams-Sonoma settled those charges and was required to pay $1 million to the FTC, and the following year, it submitted a report describing how it had complied with every provision in the order.</p><p>However, the FTC&#39;s new claims state the company has violated the order with multiple deceptive U.S.-origin claims in the years since â€” including on three products in July 2021, when it filed the compliance order.</p><p>One such claim, which the FTC says Williams-Sonoma made between April 2022 and August 2023, involved certain PBTeen mattress pads that were advertised as &#34;crafted in America from domestic and imported materials.&#34; The federal body said in numerous instances, those products were actually &#34;wholly imported&#34; from China.</p><p>The FTC said this finding led them to discover six other products on the retailer&#39;s websites that were advertised as American-made despite either containing foreign components or being processed internationally. It states Williams-Sonoma couldn&#39;t demonstrate the validity of its own claims, and the retailer admitted to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/williams-sonoma-is-fined-by-us-ftc-over-made-usa-claims-2024-04-23/" data-cms-ai="0">Reuters</a> that the allegations made in the complaint were true.</p><p>Williams-Sonoma ranked No. 1,469 on Forbes&#39; largest companies in the world list last year. With brands under its own moniker, Pottery Barn, West Elm and more, the company raked in nearly $8.7 billion in sales last year.</p><p>It&#39;s interesting to question, however, if U.S.-made labels have at all contributed to the company&#39;s success.</p><p>One survey last year found two-thirds of its 1,000 respondents said they regularly sought out &#34;Made in America&#34; products, and 50% said they&#39;d be willing to pay more for them. Another survey from the <a href="https://reshoringinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/made-in-usa-survey.pdf" data-cms-ai="0">Reshoring Institute</a>in 2020 found over 69% of respondents preferred American-made products, and more than 80% were willing to pay 10% to 20% more for them.</p></div>
