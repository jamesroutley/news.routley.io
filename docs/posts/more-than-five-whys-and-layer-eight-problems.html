    <h1>More than five whys and &#34;layer eight&#34; problems</h1>
    
    
<p>
I saw a post about a year ago talking about the "five whys" technique of 
trying to figure out what caused something to fail.  It was using a car 
scenario for an example, and it went something like this:
</p><p>
The car didn't start... because the battery is dead... because the 
alternator wasn't charging it... because the alternator belt broke... 
because the belt was beyond its useful life but wasn't replaced... 
because it wasn't maintained according to recommended schedule.
</p><p>
That's about five levels, and it pretty much stopped there.  I figure, 
well, you can go beyond that, and in the case of the infra stuff at 
a big enough company, you probably need to if you intend to actually try 
to fix something.
</p><p>
So, that's been my life: trying to roll back through the series of 
actions (or lack of actions) to see how things happened, and then trying 
to do something about it.  The problem is that if you do this long 
enough, eventually the problems start leaving the tech realm and enter 
the squishy human realm.
</p><p>
Perhaps you've heard of the OSI model of networking, where you have 
seven layers as a way to talk about what's going on in the "stack".  
I've seen some brilliantly snarky T-shirts that talk about "layer eight" 
and sometimes beyond as things like "corporate politics" and 
"management" and all of that good stuff.
</p><p>
It turns out that when you start doing this root-cause analysis and 
really keep after it, the "squishy human realm" is actually the 
no-longer-hypothetical "layer eight" from those T-shirts.
</p><p>
In our "car" example, you might discover that management is forcing 
people to ignore the maintenance schedule while saying things like 
"it'll work, trust me".  Or, they're doing even worse things, like 
ignoring safety codes that have been written in blood.
</p><p>
For those of us in tech, we tend to get off much more lightly than 
people who do Actual Stuff in the Real World (like cars).  Chasing down 
our problems means you start getting into things like "empire-building 
manager is hiring anyone with a pulse in order to look more important 
by having more direct reports".  Maybe you chase that one down and you 
get to "manager of manager is also into this whole thing, and benefits 
from the equation".
</p><p>
That might lead into "the entire company is obsessed with hiring even 
though the tech equivalent of the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation">Drake equation</a>
says there is no way they can find anywhere near that many qualified 
people in the entire world.
</p><p>
What that does that look like?  Well, some people have no business 
working on certain kinds of systems, whether as a transient situation, 
or a permanent one.  Transient situations are a lack of training.  
Permanent ones might come from attitudes or a genuine lack of ability 
for whatever reason.  Having the wrong person on the job is supposed to
be noticed and handled by the manager.  If they don't, that's a failure.  
</p><p>
Now, the team's manager (M1) also has a manager (M2) of some kind, and 
M2 is supposed to be making sure M1 can actually, well, manage!  If they 
can't tell if that's happening or not, that too is a failure.
</p><p>
In some situations, you come to realize that a whole bunch of bad things 
happen due to non-technical causes, and they are some of the hardest 
things that you might ever need to remove from an organization.  Unlike 
the line workers, management is in a whole different world in which the 
"reality distortion field" matters most.  You either generate a big 
enough one yourself, or you slot into someone else's.  If you are 
opposed to it, you are rejected.
</p><p>
I guess this is my way of warning anyone who fancies themselves a 
troubleshooter and who really, truly, wants to get to the bottom of 
things.  If you do this long enough, expect to start discovering truly 
unsatisfying situations that cannot be resolved.
</p><p>
Also, I will remind anyone who wants to try to tilt at such a windmill 
that if you are given responsibility without the power to make any 
changes, then you have just become the scapegoat.  I said this in a
<a href="/w/2013/02/20/toast/">post</a>
way back in February 2013, and I *still* fell into that damn trap in 
2017 within a particularly broken organization.
</p><p>
Finally, in this same vein, I wanted to share something that a reader 
sent to me a while back, and that I found to be brilliant and amazing 
<span title="RIP Mitch">(I still do, but I did then, too)</span>:
<a href="https://yosefk.com/blog/people-can-read-their-managers-mind.html">People can read their manager's mind</a>.
</p><p>
In particular, pay attention to where it says corollary 1 and starts 
talking about the "insane employee".  The whole "personal offense" 
thing?  Yeah, if you have the ability to not become that person, try to 
avoid it.  Alternatively, if you're cursed with the tendency to fall 
into those things, try not to give yourself a hard time when someone 
terrible takes advantage of you for the nth time.
</p><p>
Hang in there.
