This is summed up in the well-worn axiom: “Defense must be correct 100% of the time, attackers only have to be right once.” While it may be true that attackers face fewer constraints and take advantage of their flexibility, defenders have something more valuable - coordination towards a common goal of keeping people safe.</p><p>Below are some general project ideas that our team has put forward:</p><ul><li>Collect and label data from cyber defenders to train defensive cybersecurity agents</li><li>Detect and mitigate social engineering tactics</li><li>Automate incident triage </li><li>Identify security issues in source code</li><li>Assist network or device forensics</li><li>Automatically patch vulnerabilities</li><li>Optimize patch management processes to improve prioritization, scheduling, and deployment of security updates</li><li>Develop or improve confidential compute on GPUs</li><li>Create honeypots and deception technology to misdirect or trap attackers</li><li>Assist reverse engineers in creating signatures and behavior based detections of malware</li><li>Analyze an organization’s security controls and compare to compliance regimes</li><li>Assist developers to create <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/principles_approaches_for_security-by-design-default_508_0.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">secure by design and secure by default</a> software</li><li>Assist end users to adopt security best practices</li><li>Aid security engineers and developers to create robust threat models</li><li>Produce threat intelligence with salient and relevant information for defenders tailored to their organization</li><li>Help developers port code to memory safe languages<br/></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div><!----><!----><!----><!----></div><div><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><!----><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>If you share our vision for a secure and innovative AI-driven future, we invite you to submit your proposals and join us in our aim towards enhancing defensive cybersecurity technologies.</p><p>OpenAI will evaluate and accept applications for funding or other support on a rolling basis. Strong preference will be given to practical applications of AI in defensive cybersecurity (tools, methods, processes). We will grant in increments of $10,000 USD from a fund of $1M USD, in the form of API credits, direct funding and/or equivalents.</p><p>Offensive-security projects will not be considered for funding at this time.</p><p>All projects should be intended to be licensed or distributed for maximal public benefit and sharing, and we will prioritize applications that have a clear plan for this. </p><p>Please submit your proposal <a href="https://medium.com/form/cybersecurity-grant-program" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.<span id="docs-internal-guid-57a36dc2-7fff-884c-5800-cbd278a61868"><br/></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><!----><!----><!----><!----></div><!--]--></div></div>
