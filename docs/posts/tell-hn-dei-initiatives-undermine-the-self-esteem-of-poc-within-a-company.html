    <h1>Tell HN: DEI initiatives undermine the self esteem of PoC within a company</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As a black man, I have some issues with the DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) trend. As it exists within some (most?) companies, it seems to perpetuate imposter syndrome significantly. For example, I know I&#39;m talented - I&#39;ve got the projects, certs, and experience to back it up.</p><p>However, when I have to join a cheesy townhall once a month to discuss diversity hires, it makes me feel like I have no right to feel proud of any accomplishments I&#39;ve made within the company.</p><p>&#34;Why should I feel proud of my accomplishments, when the accomplishments were spoon-fed to me by the company because of my skin color? If I were a white man with the same experience, I might not even be here?&#34;</p><p>In my opinion, it would be beneficial if DEI initiatives were confidential and kept &#34;hush hush&#34; within a company. Diversity is able to be seen. If you&#39;re actually a diverse company, then people will notice.</p><p>I could understand publishing a quarterly report, but creating townhall meetings and parading your black/brown employees around like show ponies is nothing short of corporate virtue signaling.</p><p>I realize this isn&#39;t the type of content posted to HN usually, and I realize it is in &#39;rant&#39; territory, but I know a lot of managers in a lot of influential companies hangout here, so I figured posting this could spark some meaningful discussion.</p></div></div></div>
