    <h1>Ask HN: Has Anyone Trained a personal LLM using their personal notes?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Some here comment on notes they&#39;ve taken for their entire life, often using powerful note-taking systems.</p><p>Of course, there&#39;s a ton of note-taking systems out there. Org-Mode [1], Obsidian [2], plain .txt, ...</p><p>And it&#39;s become quite simple to integrate such systems with LLMs.</p><p>Whether to add that data to the LLM [3], using LLM formatting, or to visualize and use it as a personal partner. For the latter - there&#39;s also a ton of open-source UIs such as Chatbot-ui[4] and Reor[5].</p><p>And that&#39;s just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Personally, I haven&#39;t been consistent enough through the years in note-taking.</p><p>So, I&#39;m really curious to learn more about those of you who were and implemented such pipelines.</p><p>I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a ton of cool interaction experiences.</p><p>[1] https://orgmode.org/
