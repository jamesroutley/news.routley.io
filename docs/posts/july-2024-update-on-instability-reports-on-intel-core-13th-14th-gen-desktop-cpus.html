						<p>No, they have not been completely open at all. That&#39;s why people are still speculating. They didn&#39;t explain exactly what is going on. They just said incorrect elevated voltages requested by the CPU microcode are the root cause. They didn&#39;t describe exactly which voltages they are talking about, and how exactly the elevated voltages caused the instability issue.</p><p>In particular, they didn&#39;t say if the elevated voltages caused irreversible degradation of the CPU, which in turn caused the stability issues. They didn&#39;t say if fixing the microcode will make the affected CPUs stable again, or if the fix just prevents further degradation of the CPU. They didn&#39;t say if the microcode update will reduce performance to restore stability.</p><p>It&#39;s very likely that there is permanent damage to the CPUs exposed to the excessive voltage. Even CPUs that are still stable now may have had their life significantly reduced already. My CPU is unstable, it became unstable after just a couple of months of use, and I had to reduce its maximum frequency repeatedly, every 3-4 months, to keep it stable. It&#39;s very likely that it has been permanently damaged by this issue, and it might have been affected by the oxidation issue too, and it will probably have to be replaced.</p><p>Even the oxidation question has only been answered on reddit after somebody asked, instead of adding this information here from the beginning. I mean, I appreciate we got some information, but considering the scale of the issues its less than I expected.</p><p>For the oxidation issue for example, we don&#39;t have the exact time range for the products affected, or other ways to identify if we are affected or not. I bought my CPU in December 2022, so since the oxidation issue was fixed in 2023, I&#39;m almost certainly affected.</p>
