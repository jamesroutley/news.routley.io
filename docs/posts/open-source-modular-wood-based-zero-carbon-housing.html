    <h1>Open source, modular, wood based, zero carbon housing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h3>Precision manufactured</h3><p>WikiHouse components are digitally fabricated to millimetre precision, so they fit together perfectly to create a straight, accurate building. This makes everything a lot easier later.</p></div><div><h3>Lightweight</h3><p>A typical wall block weighs just 39kg, making it easy to handle and install.</p></div><div><h3>Strong</h3><p>Interlocked plywood is incredibly strong. A single wall block can support the weight of three elephants. Although we don&#39;t recommend you try this, because the elephants don&#39;t like it.</p></div><div><h3>Durable</h3><p>Spruce plywood has a certified life of 60 years, but if it is kept dry it will last for hundreds of years.</p></div></div><div><div><h3>Highly insulated</h3><p>The blocks have a U value of 0.14 W/m²K, so your building will be ultra-low energy by default.</p></div><div><h3>Carbon negative</h3><p>As well as creating fewer emissions in production than other materials, wood actually captures and stores carbon from the atmosphere while it is in use.</p></div><div><h3>Interoperable</h3><p>WikiHouse Skylark blocks are compatible with almost any type of foundations or cladding, and includes zones for ducts, pipes and wires.</p></div><div><h3>Easy to assemble</h3><p>A small team can assemble a chassis in hours, without needing traditional construction skills. </p></div><div><h3>Circular</h3><p>WikiHouse Skylark buildings can be disassembled instead of demolished, and blocks re–used or recycled at the end of their life.</p></div></div></div>
