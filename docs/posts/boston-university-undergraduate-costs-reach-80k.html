			<h3><span>Probably less than you think.</span></h3>
<p><span>Why? Because BU meets 100% of demonstrated financial need for all admitted, first-year students who are US citizens or permanent residents. Each family’s circumstance is unique and BU will create a custom package for you to meet your family’s full demonstrated financial need.</span></p>
<p><span>We firmly believe that everyone admitted to BU deserves the opportunity to attend BU. We’re offering expanded financial aid packages of scholarships, grants, low-interest student loans, and Work-Study that will make up the difference between the cost of attendance and what you can afford. That’s why it’s so important for you to consider applying for financial assistance—even if you think you may not be eligible.</span></p>
<h3><span>Great news!</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>100% of need is met for first-year students who are US citizens or permanent residents.</li>
<li>$329.5 million in financial aid is awarded annually to undergraduates.</li>
<li>For students who receive aid, the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/finaid/aid-basics/bu-scholarship-assurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BU Scholarship Assurance</a> guarantees your BU need-based aid will not be reduced for any of your undergraduate years at Boston University.</li>

<h4>Student Health Insurance Costs</h4>
<p>Massachusetts law requires all students enrolled in at least 75% of the full-time curriculum to have medical insurance. Students who cannot demonstrate coverage under a qualifying medical insurance plan are required to purchase the University’s student health insurance plan, which is due and payable with your first-semester charges. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/shs/ship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Student Health Services website</a>.</p>
