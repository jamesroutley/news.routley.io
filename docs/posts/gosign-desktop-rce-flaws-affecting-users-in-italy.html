I. BACKGROUND

GoSign is an advanced and qualified electronic signature solution 
developed by Tinexta InfoCert S.p.A., used by public administrations, 
businesses, and professionals to manage approval workflows with 
traceability and security.

The SaaS/web version of the product has received the &#34;QC2&#34; qualification
from the Italian National Cybersecurity Agency (ACN).

The QC2 qualification certifies a service&#39;s ability to securely handle
critical data, including data processed by public administrations. Under
ACN&#39;s regulation effective from August 1, 2024, cloud service providers
for public entities must meet strict security and resilience
requirements. This qualification enables public administrations to adopt
certified solutions for safeguarding sensitive data and ensuring
continuity of essential services.

GoSign Desktop, subject of this advisory, is the on-premise version
released for Microsoft Windows, Linux Ubuntu, and Apple macOS.

II. DESCRIPTION

We have identified a critical vulnerability in the GoSign Desktop 
software, developed by Tinexta InfoCert. The platform is widely used 
for signing, verifying, and managing electronic documents. In 2021 
alone, it was used by 1.6 million people to perform over 830 million 
signing transactions, confirming its central role in the Italian and 
European digital ecosystem.

GoSign Desktop disables TLS certificate validation (`SSL_VERIFY_NONE`)
in the `libdgsapi.so` and `libcurl.so` modules when configured to use a 
proxy server, removing any assurance regarding server identity during 
encrypted communications. This compromises the security of TLS 
connections and opens the door to Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. 
Additionally, the update mechanism relies on an unsigned manifest, 
meaning security depends entirely on the TLS layer.

We verified three attack scenarios that severely impact the security of 
GoSign Desktop users:

Malicious software installation (Critical): A network attacker can 
deceive the client into installing fake updates, taking control of the 
machine with the privileges of the user running GoSign Desktop 
(Windows, macOS) or with administrative privileges (Linux).

Credential theft (High): Access information (tokens, temporary 
passwords) can be intercepted because the application does not verify 
the server&#39;s identity.

Privilege escalation (High): A local attacker with the same privileges 
as the GoSign Desktop user can enable proxy settings and inject a 
malicious update to gain full control of the system (Linux).

III. ANALYSIS

1) TLS verification bypass

The `GoSignDesktop` process, through `libdgsapi.so` and `libcurl.so`, 
disables TLS certificate verification by invoking 
`SSL_CTX_set_verify(mode=SSL_VERIFY_NONE)` when configured to use a 
proxy server.

This setting completely disables certificate validation during the TLS 
handshake, effectively nullifying the authenticity and confidentiality 
guarantees of the TLS channel. As a result, a remote attacker can 
perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks to intercept and manipulate 
traffic. Neither the authenticity of the InfoCert server nor the proxy 
server is verified.

The vulnerability was confirmed in methods related to update checks 
(`UpdateManager::get_manifest`, `UpdateManager::check_and_download`) and
OAuth renewal and authentication operations (`ISACBinder::refresh` and 
`UpdateManager::getIdentity`).

However, it is plausible that any request originating from `libdgsapi.so`
is affected by the same certificate validation issue.

Tested and vulnerable versions due to lack of TLS certificate validation:

- GoSign Desktop 2.4.0 (standard) Windows

- GoSign Desktop 2.4.0 (standard) Linux

The vendor confirms that the macOS version is also affected:

- GoSign Desktop 2.4.0 (standard) macOS

1.1) Insecure Update

The GoSign Desktop update mechanism relies on an unsigned manifest 
containing the package URL and its SHA-256 hash. A MitM attacker can 
provide a malicious manifest with a matching hash, tricking the client 
into downloading and installing a tampered package, resulting in remote 
code execution.

Effectively, the update manifest&#39;s authentication is entirely delegated 
to the TLS layer, which is not validated-thus rendering all 
authenticity guarantees ineffective.

This architecture is conceptually flawed: since the manifest is not 
digitally signed, it protects at most against accidental integrity 
issues (e.g., corrupted files) but offers no defense against active 
attacks. Without valid TLS and manifest signing, an attacker can 
replace both the package and its hash, fully bypassing the security 
mechanism.

Instead of adopting established solutions for secure software 
distribution, a custom mechanism was implemented that reintroduces 
well-known, extensively documented risks. This design choice was 
avoidable given the availability of reliable, industry-standard 
approaches that would have ensured update integrity and authenticity.

1.2) Verified Security Impacts

We have confirmed three concrete attack scenarios that severely 
compromise the security of GoSign Desktop:

- OAuth Secrets Information Disclosure

- Remote Code Execution

- Privilege Escalation

It is likely that additional attack vectors exist but have not yet been 
identified. Given the severity of the confirmed impacts, we immediately 
alerted the relevant authorities (ACN/CSIRT Italia) to ensure 
responsible and timely incident handling.

1.3) CVSS 3.1

CVSS Base Score: 8.2
CVSS Vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

1.4) CWE Mappings

CWE-295: Improper Certificate Validation - use of SSL_VERIFY_NONE / 
         disabled TLS verification

CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature - absence of 
         signature validation on manifests/metadata

CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor - 
         OAuth secrets exposed over an unverified channel

2) Attack scenarios

2.1) MitM

In a typical Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack scenario, an attacker 
positioned to intercept network traffic can respond to TLS requests 
initiated by GoSign Desktop by presenting a self-signed certificate. 
Since GoSign Desktop disables certificate validation when configured to 
use a proxy, the client establishes the connection without verifying 
the server&#39;s identity.

The attacker can thus intercept and read sensitive requests and 
responses-specifically, OAuth calls may disclose secrets such as 
client_secret, JWT tokens, or refresh tokens.

Simultaneously, the attacker can respond to update requests by 
providing a tampered manifest that points to a compromised package and 
includes the SHA-256 hash of the malicious payload. Because the client 
has neither TLS verification enabled nor a digital signature on the 
manifest, it downloads the update and executes the attacker&#39;s code with 
administrative (root) privileges if running on Linux, or with the 
privileges of the user running GoSign on Windows or macOS.

2.2) Privilege Escalation

A second exploitation vector involves the preliminary compromise of the 
unprivileged user account running GoSign Desktop.

A local attacker can independently modify the HTTP-PROXY settings in 
the configuration file ~/.gosign/dike.conf, causing the client to 
download a malicious update and thereby escalate privileges to root.

IV. WORKAROUND

Fix in GoSign Desktop 2.4.1

In version 2.4.1 of GoSign Desktop, released on 2025-11-04, a fix was 
introduced to verify the digital signature of the update manifest. 
However, the lack of TLS certificate validation when the application is 
configured to use a proxy remains unaddressed.

- Information Disclosure of OAuth secrets â€“ NOT FIXED
- Remote Code Execution â€“ FIXED
- Privilege Escalation â€“ FIXED

VI. VENDOR RESPONSE

Handling of Responsible Disclosure by Vendor Tinexta InfoCert

Following the initial contact, the vendor was provided with all 
technical details of the vulnerability, the Proof of Concept (PoC), and 
mitigation suggestions-both via encrypted email and during a Teams call 
requested by the vendor and held on 2025-10-16 at 15:00. Present at the 
call were the InfoCert security officer and the product manager for 
GoSign Desktop. During the call, the vendor confirmed the vulnerability 
and agreed that October 31, 2025, was a reasonable deadline for 
releasing a fix.

After this call, the vendor ceased all communication, failed to provide 
any further updates, and did not respond to subsequent contact 
attempts.

On 2025-11-04, the fix was released publicly without any announcement 
from the vendor and without honoring the request to include a changelog 
acknowledgment.

ACN/CSIRT Italia was notified about the vendor&#39;s improper handling of 
responsible disclosure best practices.

IX. TECHNICAL DETAILS

Collected evidence indicates that the disabling of TLS certificate 
verification is not an isolated anomaly: the `SSL_VERIFY_NONE` behavior 
is systematically applied during the initialization of TLS connections 
by GoSign Desktop when the proxy setting is enabled.

To demonstrate this, a dynamic runtime instrumentation approach was 
used, intercepting OpenSSL APIs responsible for certificate 
verification configuration. The findings confirm that the application&#39;s 
default behavior sets the `SSL_VERIFY_NONE` flag and that certificate 
checks are explicitly disabled. In its current configuration, GoSign 
effectively functions as a backdoor installed on a vast number of 
systems used by major public administrations, ministries, and Italian 
enterprises.

To observe this behavior at runtime, a hook library (LD_PRELOAD) was 
developed to intercept calls to `SSL_CTX_set_verify()` and 
`SSL_set_verify()` functions exported by the cryptographic libraries.

Static analysis of the binary `/usr/lib/gosigndesktop/GoSignDesktop` 
returned a series of strings suggesting the existence of flags and 
parameters intended to disable TLS checks or log cryptographic 
information.

These occurrences indicate that the code includes mechanisms (or 
supports parameters) which, if enabled, can alter certificate 
verification behavior or activate sensitive TLS key logging.

--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--8&lt;--

To verify whether these parameters were passed to the running process, 
the command line of all GoSignDesktop processes was checked by reading 
their respective `/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/cmdline`.

On the analyzed systems, the binary&#39;s execution shows that child 
processes use various `--type` arguments (zygote, gpu-process, 
renderer, etc.) and internal options typical of Chromium/Electron-based 
runtimes, but no flags explicitly disabling TLS verification were 
found.

X. PoC

The provided Proof of Concept targets a GoSign Desktop installation on 
Debian/Ubuntu Linux with amd64 architecture and simulates a local 
privilege escalation to root by a local attacker.

After the exploit, you will need to reinstall GoSign Desktop by 
downloading it again from the official website, as it is replaced by 
the fake update package. The GoSign Desktop configuration is preserved.

https://www.ush.it/team/ush/hack-gosign-desktop_240/gosigndesktop_mitm_poc.mp4

1) Build

Compile the fake .deb update package and create the Python virtual
environment with the dependencies required for the exploit: `make`

2) Run

Configure the exploit to act as a proxy for GoSign Desktop in order to
simulate the attack: `make run`

3) PoC Evidence

After installing the fake .deb update package, you can verify the impact
by checking the file: `cat /tmp/gosigndesktop_mitm_poc.log`

4) Cleanup

You can remove the proxy configuration, the .deb file, and the virtual
environment: `make clean`
