  <p><span>12 Dec 2025</span></p><p>Haven’t posted here in a while, but this is worth an update: <strong>I’m moving to Berlin</strong>.
I’ve loved living in Bangalore for the last decade (I moved here just after the
first HillHacks in May 2015), but it is time for an adventure.</p>

<p>For the last couple of years, I’ve spent my time living in
Indiranagar, building communities, helping underline.center,
working on blr.today, organizing events, and really doing things that I care
about. It has been a wonderful time, but we wanted to experience life
elsewhere, and Berlin seems to fit the bill.</p>

<p>Bangalore’s infrastructure has been in the news, and it is a part of why I’m
moving. An unwalkable footpath on CMH road meant we spent half a year dealing
with a broken elbow this year. At Takshashila, I was taught that I’m not
allowed to bring up civic problems without also coming up with solutions. But
Bangalore is an unsolvable paradox: A city with 50+ unicorns and no walkable
footpaths.</p>

<p>I’ve fought my personal share of battles against the state, but this is one
where I don’t have any hope of making a difference. I appreciate the work
that the Bangalore Civil Society is doing in attempting to hold the
missing-government accountable - it just isn’t the kind of work that I want
to do. <mark>Fighting for basic necessities (clean air, walkable footpaths, open
public spaces, well-funded public transit) shouldn&#39;t be anyone&#39;s job in a
city as large as Bangalore</mark>. I’m <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty">picking Exit</a> (for now).</p>

<p>Why Berlin? Mainly because I have lots of friends there. Our immigration journey
is still quite early, so maybe I can write about it when things have stabilized
a bit. For now, if you have any Berlin recommendations or connections, please
send them <a href="https://developer.apple.com/contact/">my way</a>.</p>
