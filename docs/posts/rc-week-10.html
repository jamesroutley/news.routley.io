<ul>
  <li>Made <a href="https://www.openwhen.site/">openwhen</a> look good on mobile thanks to @<strong>Priya</strong> and @<strong>Jesse</strong>  and fixed some bugs</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tues">Tues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>thank you @_<strong>Laura</strong> for your advice on looking for summer swe internships!</li>
  <li>Half-baked demos</li>
  <li>A very nice chat with @<strong>Russell</strong></li>

<ul>
  <li>thank you again @_<strong>Laura</strong></li>
  <li>Made my <a href="https://github.com/grkw">GitHub</a> profile as recruiting-ready as I could (added readme’s to my git repo, added a profile readme)</li>
  <li>Same for <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-j-kwak/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://gracekwak.me/">personal website</a>, resume</li>
</ul>

<p>Realized I might be getting rejected from PhD internships because I’m competing against students who are actually currently enrolled and more senior PhD students. And I might be getting rejected from undergrad internships because I’m no longer in undergrad and also the undergrad internship recruiting season was last autumn haha</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pairing on 2 Leetles with @<strong>Daniel</strong> . Today’s was very difficult and I felt validated that we both found it difficult. Learned a few great python debugging tips:<code>input()</code> function: wait take input from stdin and can use as breakpoints haha, <code>-i</code> flag: to run scripts in a repl</li>
  <li>Tried implementing a more robust user flow for opening letters and realized my code is just too much of a mess to work with so switched to cleaning up the code – plus I want the code to be recruiting-ready anyway. Got about halfway through!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fri">Fri</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Paired with @<strong>Sherry</strong>  on a few Leetles (including <a href="https://leetle.app/?date=2025-01-29">queue reconstruction by height</a>!!!!! ft. @<strong>Nolen</strong>)</li>
  <li>Finished cleaning up Open When code so that I could finally start fixing the user flow for opening letters.</li>
</ul>
