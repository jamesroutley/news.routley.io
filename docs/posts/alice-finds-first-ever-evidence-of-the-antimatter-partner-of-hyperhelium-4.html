<p>Collisions between heavy ions at the Large Hadron Collider (<a href="https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider">LHC</a>) create <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/heavy-ions-and-quark-gluon-plasma">quark–gluon plasma</a>, a hot and dense state of matter that is thought to have filled the Universe around one millionth of a second after the Big Bang. Heavy-ion collisions also create suitable conditions for the production of atomic nuclei and exotic hypernuclei, as well as their <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/antimatter">antimatter</a> counterparts, antinuclei and antihypernuclei. Measurements of these forms of matter are important for various purposes, including helping to understand the formation of hadrons from the plasma’s constituent quarks and gluons and the <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/matter-antimatter-asymmetry-problem">matter–antimatter asymmetry</a> seen in the present-day Universe.</p>

<p>Hypernuclei are exotic nuclei formed by a mix of protons, neutrons and hyperons, the latter being unstable particles containing one or more quarks of the strange type. More than 70 years since their discovery in <a href="https://home.cern/science/physics/cosmic-rays-particles-outer-space">cosmic rays</a>, hypernuclei remain a source of fascination for physicists because they are rarely found in nature and it’s challenging to create and study them in the laboratory.</p>

<p>In heavy-ion collisions, hypernuclei are created in significant quantities, but until recently only the lightest hypernucleus, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02782920">hypertriton</a>, and its antimatter partner, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.1183980#body-ref-R5">antihypertriton</a>, have been observed. A hypertriton is composed of a proton, a neutron and a lambda (a hyperon containing one strange quark). An antihypertriton is made up of an antiproton, an antineutron and an antilambda.</p>

<p>Following hot on the heels of an <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07823-0">observation</a> of antihyperhydrogen-4 (a bound state of an antiproton, two antineutrons and an antilambda), reported earlier this year by the STAR collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (<a href="https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/">RHIC</a>), the ALICE collaboration at the LHC has now seen the first ever <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17769">evidence</a> of antihyperhelium-4, which is composed of twoantiprotons, an antineutron and an antilambda. The result has a significance of 3.5 <a href="https://home.cern/resources/faqs/five-sigma">standard deviations</a> and also represents the first evidence of the heaviest antimatter hypernucleus yet at the LHC.</p>

<p>The ALICE measurement is based on lead–lead collision data taken in 2018 at an energy of 5.02 teraelectronvolts (TeV) for each colliding pair of nucleons (protons and neutrons). Using a machine-learning technique that outperforms conventional hypernuclei search techniques, the ALICE researchers looked at the data for signals of hyperhydrogen-4, hyperhelium-4 and their antimatter partners. Candidates for (anti)hyperhydrogen-4 were identified by looking for the (anti)helium-4 nucleus and the charged pion into which it decays, whereas candidates for (anti)hyperhelium-4 were identified via its decay into an (anti)helium-3 nucleus, an (anti)proton and a charged pion.</p>

<p>In addition to finding evidence of antihyperhelium-4 with a significance of 3.5 standard deviations, as well as evidence of antihyperhydrogen-4 with a significance of 4.5 standard deviations, the ALICE team measured the production yields and masses of both hypernuclei.</p>

<p>For both hypernuclei, the measured masses are compatible with the current <a href="https://hypernuclei.kph.uni-mainz.de/">world-average values</a>. The measured production yields were compared with predictions from the statistical hadronisation model, which provides a good description of the formation of hadrons and nuclei in heavy-ion collisions. This comparison shows that the model’s predictions agree closely with the data if both excited hypernuclear states and ground states are included in the predictions. The results confirm that the statistical hadronisation model can also provide a good description of the production of hypernuclei, which are compact objects with sizes of around 2 femtometres (1 femtometre is 10<sup>-15</sup> metres).</p>

<p>The researchers also determined the antiparticle-to-particle yield ratios for both hypernuclei and found that they agree with unity within the experimental uncertainties. This agreement is consistent with <a href="https://cerncourier.com/a/balancing-matter-and-antimatter-in-pb-pb-collisions/">ALICE’s observation</a> of the equal production of matter and antimatter at LHC energies and adds to the ongoing research into the matter–antimatter imbalance in the Universe.</p>
