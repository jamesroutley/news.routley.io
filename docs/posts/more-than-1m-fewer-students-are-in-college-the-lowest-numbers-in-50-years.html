    <h1>More than 1M fewer students are in college, the lowest numbers in 50 years</h1>

   <p>More than 1 million fewer students are enrolled in college now than before the pandemic began. According to new data released Thursday, U.S. colleges and universities saw a drop of nearly 500,000 undergraduate students in the fall of 2021, continuing a historic decline that began the previous fall.</p>   <p>&#34;It&#39;s very frightening,&#34; says Doug Shapiro, who leads the research center at the National Student Clearinghouse, where the new data comes from. &#34;Far from filling the hole of [2020&#39;s] enrollment declines, we are still digging it deeper.&#34;</p>   <p>Compared with the fall of 2019, the last fall semester before the coronavirus pandemic, undergraduate enrollment has fallen a total of 6.6%. That represents the largest two-year decrease in more than 50 years, Shapiro says.</p>

   <p>The nation&#39;s community colleges are continuing to feel the bulk of the decline, with a 13% enrollment drop over the course of the pandemic. But the fall 2021 numbers show that bachelor&#39;s degree-seeking students at four-year colleges are making up about half of the shrinkage in undergraduate students, a big shift from the fall of 2020, when the vast majority of the declines were among associate degree seekers.</p>   <p>&#34;The phenomenon of students sitting out of college seems to be more widespread. It&#39;s not just the community colleges anymore,&#34; says Shapiro. &#34;That could be the beginning of a whole generation of students rethinking the value of college itself. I think if that were the case, this is much more serious than just a temporary pandemic-related disruption.&#34;</p>

   <p>Graduate program enrollment, which saw an increase in the fall of 2020, declined slightly, down by nearly 11,000 in the fall of 2021.</p>   <p>Overall, enrollment in undergraduate and graduate programs has been trending <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/16/787909495/fewer-students-are-going-to-college-heres-why-that-matters">downward since around 2012</a>, but the pandemic turbocharged the declines at the undergrad level. </p>   <div id="res1072643594">

   <p>Many were hopeful that would-be undergraduates who chose to take a year off in 2020 would return in 2021, especially given the expanded opportunities for in-person learning. But the pandemic gap year appears to be a myth: The National Student Clearinghouse <a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021_HSBenchmarksReport.pdf">found</a> that of the 2020 high school graduates who chose not to enroll in college after graduation, <a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021_HSBenchmarksReport.pdf">only 2%</a> ended up enrolling a year later, in the fall of 2021.</p>   <p>&#34;The easiest assumption is that they&#39;re out there working,&#34; says Shapiro. &#34;Unemployment is down. The labor market is good. Wages are rising for workers in low-skilled jobs. So if you have a high school diploma, this seems like a pretty good time to be out there making some money.&#34;</p>   <p>Wages at the bottom of the economy have increased dramatically, making minimum-wage jobs especially appealing to young people as an alternative to college. In December, for example, jobs for non-managers working in leisure and hospitality <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t24.htm">paid 15% more than a year ago</a>, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

   <p>&#34;It&#39;s very tempting for high school graduates, but the fear is that they are trading a short-term gain for a long-term loss,&#34; Shapiro says. &#34;And the longer they stay away from college, you know, life starts to happen and it becomes harder and harder to start thinking about yourself going back into a classroom.&#34;</p>   <h3>It&#39;s hard to give up a paycheck</h3>   <p>For Brian Williams, who graduated from high school early in the pandemic, the long-term plan is to go to college.</p>   <p>He <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/17/925831720/losing-a-generation-fall-college-enrollment-plummets-for-first-year-students">postponed enrolling</a> in 2020 because he was tired of remote learning; instead, he got a job at a Jimmy John&#39;s sandwich store near his home in the suburbs of Houston so he could start saving up. When it was time to enroll in fall 2021 classes, he postponed again — he says he was more interested in finding a job that paid more than in giving up much of his paycheck to go to school. In August, Williams left Jimmy John&#39;s and got a job at an Amazon warehouse; his hourly earnings jumped up by $4.50.</p>   <p>&#34;I feel more secure within the money I&#39;m getting,&#34; he says. To get to and from his new job, he bought a car, which he&#39;s working to pay off.</p>   <div id="res1072560771">

   <p>For Williams, enrolling in college means he&#39;ll have to cut back on hours and earn less money, while also spending <em>more </em>money to pay for classes.</p>   <p>&#34;It&#39;s so hard,&#34; he says. &#34;I&#39;m just like, &#39;Wow, if I go to school, I&#39;m going to take time off and I&#39;m not going to have any money for things I need.&#39; &#34;</p>   <p>He had toyed with the idea of starting community college in the new year but is now thinking he&#39;ll start next fall, to give himself another eight months to save up.</p>   <p>He knows he doesn&#39;t want to work at Amazon forever.</p>   <p>&#34;Even though this job does give me the money I need, it&#39;s not enough for what I want, for what I see [for] myself or what I want for myself. So I have to put myself through college.&#34;</p>   <h3>The short-term benefits of a high hourly wage vs. the long-term benefits of a degree</h3>   <p>A dramatic drop in college enrollment could spell trouble for those Americans who are opting out, as well as for their families. Research has long shown that getting even some post-secondary education leads to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2020/data-on-display/education-pays.htm">higher wages, lower unemployment </a>and greater lifetime earnings. In <a href="https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/collegepayoff2021/">one study</a> from Georgetown University, bachelor&#39;s degree holders were found to &#34;earn a median of $2.8 million during their career, 75% more than if they had only a high school diploma.&#34;</p>   <p>&#34;It may be great that people are finding jobs in the short term,&#34; says researcher Tolani Britton, &#34;but an 18-year-old who is living at home and helping his family with the minimum wage that he&#39;s earning — if he&#39;s still earning that wage 15 years from now and has a family of his own to support, what are the implications in terms of socioeconomic mobility for that individual, for their children?&#34;</p>   <p>Britton, who studies the economics of higher education at the University of California, Berkeley, says a host of other benefits have been linked with higher education, including an increased likelihood of civic participation, lower infant mortality rates, better maternal health and a decreased likelihood of being unhoused or experiencing food insecurity, among other things.</p>   
   <p>Many of those social benefits stem from a lifetime of higher wages and increased financial stability — long-term payoffs that can be hard to prioritize over short-term wins, like having a little more money right now.</p>   <p>&#34;At the end of the day, the wages that you&#39;re getting today are one thing, but in 10 years from now they might be really similar,&#34; Britton explains. &#34;There may not be the growth that you would expect when people get post-secondary education.&#34;</p>   <p>But Britton also understands that it can be hard to make decisions about your future needs when you&#39;re also trying to meet the needs of today.</p>   <p>&#34;People are in hard economic situations,&#34; she says. &#34;The [pandemic] recovery has been extremely uneven.&#34;</p>   <p>On top of that, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/24/772018032/vital-federal-program-to-help-parents-in-college-is-a-drop-in-the-bucket">challenges</a> that <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/12/12/668530699/-going-to-office-hours-is-terrifying-and-other-hurdles-for-rural-students-in-col">existed</a> before the pandemic for low-income students, students of color and students who are the first in their families to go to college — those challenges haven&#39;t gone anywhere.</p>

   <p>&#34;Community colleges are the schools that traditionally enroll lower-income students,&#34; Shapiro says, &#34;so we can assume that that&#39;s primarily who is affected and still staying away the most.&#34;</p>   <p>When the National Student Clearinghouse <a href="https://nscresearchcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021_HSBenchmarksReport.pdf">looked at 2020 high school graduates</a>, it found students from lower-income schools had lower college-going numbers, as did students at high-minority high schools.</p>   <p>&#34;The gap in college access between higher-income and lower-income students grew wider,&#34; Shapiro says.</p>   <h3>The U.S. economy feels the long-term effects of fewer college graduates</h3>   <p>When fewer people go to college, fewer people graduate with the skills, credentials and degrees necessary for a higher-paying job. And that reverberates throughout the entire U.S. economy.</p>   <p>&#34;The direct loss to the economy is the workers themselves,&#34; explains Tony Carnevale, the director of Georgetown University&#39;s Center on Education and the Workforce. &#34;If they were trained and ready, they would get higher-wage jobs and they would add more to GDP, making us all richer and increasing taxes, reducing welfare costs, crime costs, on and on.&#34;</p>   <p>When workers make higher wages, their local economies also benefit. Carnevale explains it this way: &#34;When you hire the crane operator, the crane operator goes and buys groceries. So the grocery clerk has a job.&#34;</p>   <p>More and more jobs in the U.S. require some post-secondary training, Carnevale says, which makes college graduates far more valuable to the economy.</p>   <div id="res1072637855">

   <p>Before the pandemic, the country <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-manufacturing-skills-gap.html">already had a skills gap</a>, with jobs <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2018/04/25/605092520/high-paying-trade-jobs-sit-empty-while-high-school-grads-line-up-for-university">sitting empty</a> because businesses couldn&#39;t find workers with the proper credentials. In the past decade, community colleges have worked to close that gap, partnering with local businesses to pair training with employer needs.</p>   <p>But according to Carnevale, declining enrollment rates at community colleges mean that gap is going to grow — which, in turn, hurts business.</p>   <p>&#34;You can&#39;t run your business if you literally cannot find people to work in that business,&#34; says Britton, of the University of California, Berkeley.</p>   <p>And when businesses struggle, she says, &#34;that has implications for things like decreases in tax revenues, higher prices for goods and services, delays in the production of services and goods like we&#39;ve seen during the pandemic. And many of those things will only get worse if there are fewer people to fill the jobs.&#34;</p>   <p>Declines in college enrollment have a compounded impact on the economy because there are economic consequences on so many levels: the individual, the community, businesses and society as a whole.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1072642805" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP PULLQUOTE" -->
   <p>It&#39;s unclear exactly how to address these economic ripple effects. Colleges, for their part, are <a href="https://www.cabrillo.edu/watsonville-center/ganas-program/">standing up reentry programs</a> and <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/12/09/new-funds-help-community-colleges-enroll-adult-learners">creating new incentives to enroll</a>. Valencia College, a community college that serves about 50,000 students in Orlando, Fla., waived application fees, extended deadlines and allowed returning students to retake classes for free. For any student who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/02/983726230/colleges-get-creative-to-reach-students-after-enrollment-plummets-due-to-covid-1">failed a course they were forced to take online</a>, it gave them a $500 scholarship to come back and take another class in person, when things opened up.</p>   <p>Shapiro, of the National Student Clearinghouse, says local communities have the most at stake when someone puts college off, because their local economies suffer when workers aren&#39;t qualified for the best jobs.</p>   <p>He says it&#39;s on those communities to &#34;make the case that college offerings are worthwhile and it is important for students to invest in their future employability, in their skills and training.&#34;</p>   <p>Is he tired of all this bad news?</p>   <p>Yes.</p>   <p>Does he think these low college-going rates are the new normal?</p>   <p>&#34;It&#39;s a frightening thought. I sure hope not. But I guess we&#39;ll see.&#34;</p>
