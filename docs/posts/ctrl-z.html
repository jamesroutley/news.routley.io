  <p><a href="https://jackdaw-audio.net/">Jackdaw</a> is my free digital
  audio workstation, currently in progress.</p>
  <p>In this post, I describe my implementation of undo/redo, and how it
  encouraged me to think more rigorously about the nature of the program
  state. At the end, I introduce a problem that arose in the context of
  this design, which motivated the creation of program “endpoints”, a
  refactor I intend to write about in another post.</p>
  <h3 id="ctrlz-is-mandatory">Ctrl+Z is mandatory</h3>
  <p>Ever since Prometheus stole Ctrl+Z from the Gods in the 1970s
  somewhere over the U.S. state of California, the ability to undo and
  redo changes has been a crucial component of almost any interactive
  software application with a complex, mutable state. In starting work
  on my DAW, I knew that until it was endowed with an undo/redo feature,
  it would remain an infant, cute but basically unuseful and in need of
  constant supervision.</p>
  <p>There are some such staples of program design that
  <em>arguably</em> have not earned their keep – blighted trees planted
  innocently decades ago whose tainted fruits we’ve learned to tolerate.
  In those cases, I might eschew convention and attempt to blaze my own
  trail, allowing myself at least the opportunity to arrive at something
  I think is better. Ctrl+Z is not such a case; it is already perfect,
  and its fruits are delicious.</p>
  <h3 id="linear-undo">Linear undo</h3>
  <p>A consequence of the elementality of undo/redo functionality is
  that its workings are rarely given intellectual articulation for a
  casual user, much like the grammar of one’s native tongue. Therefore,
  in implementing the feature, I was saddled with the delightful task of
  discovering consciously the nature of my own unconscious expectations
  for how it ought to work.</p>
  <p>I found that my expectations aligned with the simplest version of
  “linear undo.” Linear undo is defined by a few principles:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Undoable events are logged in a list.</li>
  <li>Movement can occur in the backward (undo) or forward (redo)
  direction.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The central tradeoff of simple linear undo becomes clear when you
  consider the ramifications of making a new change after some events
  have been undone, but never redone.</p>
  <p><img src="https://annas-archive.org/assets/blog_imgs/linear_undo.png" width="100%"/></p>
  <p>Here, seven events were done, and three have been undone. What
  happens when a new event is logged in the current state?</p>
  <p><a name="dispose-forward"></a>
  <img src="https://annas-archive.org/assets/blog_imgs/linear_undo_push.png" width="100%"/></p>
  <p>It’s tempting to simply insert the new event between the
  previously-undone (red) events and the older events, but this causes a
  nightmare of state management. Let’s say that one of those red events
  was a change to an audio track, and the new (green) event is the
  deletion of that track. Redoing the change, then, would attempt a
  modification of a deleted track. The situation can quickly spiral out
  of control if many new events are done – moving the program into an
  unrecognizable state – before one of the now-stale red events is
  redone. <strong>When we undo or redo a change, we generally want the
  program to be in the same state it was in when the change was
  initially done.</strong> We will examine this more closely later.</p>
  <p>Another option would be to create a branch at the point of
  insertion. An undo <em>tree</em> has the advantage of comprehensively
  and unambiguously recording the program history, but the cost is
  ambiguity in the meaning of “redo”. At a branch point, the user would
  need to select which redo path they want to follow. The program would
  therefore need to present the user with some easily-understood
  representation of the branch before the user can make a decision. This
  would all be more trouble than it’s worth for a simple, keyboard-bound
  undo/redo feature, in my opinion.</p>
  <p>I wrote above that Ctrl+Z is perfect, but what I really mean is
  that simple linear undo makes the right tradeoffs. The simple solution
  to this particular problem is to dispose of previously-undone events
  when a new event is logged. Those events are then lost forever, and
  can no longer be redone. I’m ok with that tradeoff, at least for
  now.</p>
  <h4 id="aside-emacs">Aside: Emacs</h4>
  <p>The classic text editor Emacs has a clever solution to the problem
  that avoids the central tradeoff of simple linear undo as described
  above, without resorting to an undo tree. From their <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Undo.html">docs</a>:</p>
  <div>
  <p><em>Consecutive repetitions of C-/ (or its aliases) undo earlier
  and earlier changes in the current buffer. If all the recorded changes
  have already been undone, the undo command signals an error.</em></p>
  <p><em>Any command other than an undo command breaks the sequence of
  undo commands. Starting from that moment, the entire sequence of undo
  commands that you have just performed are themselves placed into the
  undo record. Therefore, to re-apply changes you have undone, type C-f
  or any other command that harmlessly breaks the sequence of undoing;
  then type C-/ one or more times to undo some of the undo
  commands.</em></p>
  </div>
  <p>In terms of the diagrams above, we could think about taking the red
  events, inverting each of them such that what we would consider the
  redo action associated with the event becomes the undo action (though
  there really is no concept of “redo” here), reversing their order, and
  then reinserting them into the linear history before tacking the new
  event on at the very end.</p>
  <p>This is an elegant solution, but for better or worse, it has never
  felt as intuitive to me (I am an emacs user) as the simpler one, so I
  don’t feel compelled to replicate it in Jackdaw.</p>
  <h3 id="high-level-implementation">High-level implementation</h3>
  <p>You’ve already guessed from the diagrams above that I implemented
  the event history as a doubly-linked list. It could have just as
  easily been an array, but I was feeling listy (not listless) on
  implementation day.</p>
  <h4 id="data-structure">Data structure</h4>
  <div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>typedef</span> <span>struct</span> user_event_history <span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    UserEvent <span>*</span>oldest<span>;</span></span>

<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>}</span> UserEventHistory<span>;</span></span></code></pre></div>
  <p>There’s only one of these <code>UserEventHistory</code> structs in
  any given Jackdaw project. Each <code>UserEvent</code> has a
  <code>next</code> and <code>previous</code> pointer, so those function
  as the nodes in the linked list.</p>
  <p>The length is stored so that we can constrain it, since we don’t
  want our memory usage to explode as the user’s session stretches on.
  (We could also recalculate it each time we modify the list; it makes
  little difference at the lengths we’re working with).</p>
  <p>Most of our operations on this list will occur around the
  <code>next_undo</code> event, which is next in line to be undone. An
  “undo” moves that pointer backward through the list, and “redo” moves
  it forward. The reason to store the <code>oldest</code> pointer (the
  head of the list) is to allow <code>next_undo</code> to be
  <code>NULL</code> when all of the available events have been undone,
  while still retaining access to the list. An undo is available as long
  as <code>next_undo</code> is not <code>NULL</code>, and a redo is
  available as long as <code>next_undo-&gt;next</code> is not
  <code>NULL</code>.</p>
  <h4 id="userevent-nodes">UserEvent (nodes)</h4>
  <p>Each node in the list contains all of the information needed to
  execute an undo or redo operation:</p>

  <p>We can pretty quickly understand at a high level what happens when
  the user triggers an undo:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Get the <code>next_undo</code> member of our project-level
  <code>UserEventHistory</code>.</li>
  <li>If it exists, call its <code>undo</code> “method”, passing its
  stored data to that function so that the function has everything it
  needs to do its job.</li>
  <li>Reset the <code>UserEventHistory</code>’s <code>next_undo</code>
  pointer to <code>next_undo-&gt;previous</code>.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Redo varies only in the node selection, the fact that the
  <code>redo</code> method is called instead of <code>undo</code>, and
  the resetting of <code>next_undo</code> at the end.</p>
  <p>So then what are the <code>dispose</code> and
  <code>dispose_forward</code> methods for?</p>
  <h3 id="in-the-weeds-memory-management">In the weeds: memory
  management</h3>
  <p>We already know that we want to constrain the length of our event
  history to avoid memory usage that keeps growing as new events are
  logged. This means that old events can “fall off” the end of the
  list:</p>
  <p><img src="https://annas-archive.org/assets/blog_imgs/dispose.png" width="100%"/></p>
  <p>The <code>UserEvent</code> nodes we’re dealing with are themselves
  dynamically allocated, so we will need to free them when they are no
  longer needed or accessible. But some types of events require
  additional cleanup.</p>
  <p>Let’s say we record a long audio clip, and then delete it. We want
  to be able to undo that deletion, so the clip data must not actually
  be freed. The clip is merely removed from its parent data structures,
  so that it no longer appears on the track, for example.</p>
  <p><img src="https://annas-archive.org/assets/blog_imgs/delete_clips_undo.gif" width="100%" loop="/"/></p><p>
  Audio clips being deleted, and the deletions being undone
  </p>
  <p>The clip data remains accessible on the user event. If the deletion
  event falls off the end of the event history, such that the clip
  deletion can no longer be undone, then we really do want to free the
  clip data. (That’s a lot of memory!) This is what the
  <code>dispose</code> method is for. In this example, the dispose
  method we assign will free the clip before the <code>UserEvent</code>
  itself is ultimately freed.</p>
  <p>Events also need to be “disposed” when they become inaccessible at
  the <em>front</em> of the list, as in the scenario
  <a href="#dispose-forward">described above</a> (some events have just
  been undone, and then a new event is logged). But this is not the same
  as <code>dispose</code>. If our audio clip was deleted, and that
  action was later undone, then the audio clip currently appears on our
  timeline, and should not be freed. So we don’t call the
  <code>dispose</code> method when the event is lopped off the front of
  the list; only when it falls off the back.</p>
  <p>However, if an event that allocates new memory becomes inaccessible
  at the front of the list, that memory needs to be freed, because the
  user effectively deleted the allocated object with an undo that is no
  longer redoable. This is what <code>dispose_forward</code> is for. If
  we add a track, undo that action (thereby deleting the track), and
  then register some new action, rendering a redo of the previous action
  impossible, we need to free the track.</p>
  <p>So, broadly, events that delete objects require a
  <code>dispose</code> method, and events that create objects require a
  <code>dispose_forward</code> method. Events that do neither require
  neither.</p>
  <h3 id="do-we-really-need-all-these-stored-pointers-and-values">Do we
  really need all these stored pointers and values?</h3>
  <p>Jackdaw does not exclusively use keyboard commands – you can mouse
  if you want to – but the vast majority of its functionality is
  accessible through keyboard commands. It’s tempting to think that, in
  order to implement undo, we need only look at the user inputs that are
  considered reversible, write forward and backward versions of those
  functions, and then push an event each time an undoable input is
  registered. But it isn’t quite that simple.</p>
  <p>When the user does an action, their input alone (one byte
  representing the key pressed, and two bytes representing the state of
  the modifier keys and mouse buttons) is insufficient to complete an
  action. Almost all of the user-interface functions listed in <a href="https://github.com/chvolow24/jackdaw/blob/main/src/userfn.h">userfn.h</a>,
  which are bound to keyboard inputs, must read from the program state
  before modifying it. The user merely selects which function to
  call.</p>
  <p>The concept of a “cursor” in Jackdaw (one of its unique strengths!)
  is a clear example of this. The cursor is defined as the position on
  the current timeline in the currently-selected track at the current
  playhead position. The track selector (and therefore, the cursor) is
  moved up and down with <code>p</code> and <code>n</code> (or
  <code>d</code> and <code>f</code>), and the playhead can be moved
  forward and backward by various means, including <code>l</code> (play)
  and <code>j</code> (rewind).</p>
  <p>For example, when the user triggers a “cut” command, the cut occurs
  at the cursor location:</p>
  <p><img src="https://annas-archive.org/assets/blog_imgs/cut_clip.gif" width="100%"/></p><p>
  Cuts being done, undone, and redone
  </p>
  <p>When that command is undone, and then redone, the cursor may be in
  a completely different location; so we cannot simply re-run the same
  code we used before. We need to store the location of the cursor at
  the time the cut first occurred.</p>
  <h3 id="the-deep-state">The Deep State</h3>
  <p>I wrote earlier that <strong>when we undo or redo a change, we
  generally want the program to be in the same state it was in when the
  change was initially done.</strong> This is important, because an undo
  or redo executed on a modified state might be unsafe. But the cursor
  location is part of the program state. So is, for example, how zoomed
  in our view of the timeline is, or the audio data currently being
  queued for playback. Even the mouse position and the size of the
  program window are stored in the program state. We don’t want undo and
  redo to depend on those things, and we don’t want changes to those
  things to be undoable.</p>
  <p>So what we really have is a <em>deep</em> state, for which the
  above statement is true, and a superficial state, for which the
  requirement doesn’t hold. Undo/redo operate on the deep state,
  independent of the superficial state. The user operates on the deep
  state with the aid of the superficial state.</p>
  <p>I only thought about the program state this way after implementing
  undo/redo, and momentarily feared that I would have to fundamentally
  redesign the program to more rigorously delineate the deep from the
  superficial state; but I was pleased to find the distinction had more
  or less arisen organically already, and while making it explicit might
  be wise, it is not strictly necessary.</p>
  <h3 id="problem-gui-sliders">Problem: GUI sliders</h3>
  <p>The undo/redo interface I designed worked well for almost
  everything, and I was quite content using it (unlike my dreaded
  <code>Textbox</code> interface, which I must propitiate each time I
  require its aid). But a problem did arise.</p>
  <p>There are two main ways a user can modify the volume of a
  track:</p>
  <ol type="1">
  <li>Select the track, and hold down Shift + “-” (<code>S--</code>) to
  lower the volume or Shift + “=” (<code>S-=</code>) to raise it.</li>
  <li>Click and drag the volume slider on the track.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><img src="https://annas-archive.org/assets/blog_imgs/vol_methods.gif" width="100%"/></p><p>
  Track volume being modified first with the keyboard, then the mouse
  </p>
  <p>In my original implementation of GUI sliders, each slider stored a
  pointer to its target value – in this case, to the <code>float</code>
  that represents the track volume. When the user clicks on or drags the
  slider, the new value is calculated based on the mouse position
  relative to the slider’s width, and the change propagates down to the
  target value as the slider is reset.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, when the user adjusts the volume with the
  keyboard, the track volume is changed directly by that command, and
  <em>then</em> the slider’s appearance is updated based on the new
  value of its target.</p>
  <p>So where does the undoable <code>UserEvent</code> get pushed? In
  the slider code, or the keyboard code? Or both?</p>
  <p>I decided it had to be the slider code, since the keyboard code is
  untouched when the change is done by mouse, but some slider code is
  run either way. It made me immediately uneasy to consider putting
  undo/redo logic in GUI component code, but it seemed the best way to
  achieve something generic that would work with my existing
  implementation.</p>
  <p>So I did that, and it worked fine, and it also meant that
  <em>any</em> change to <em>any</em> slider would be undoable
  automatically, without any new code. Kind of nice!</p>
  <p>What I did not consider was that some sliders are transient:</p>
  <p><img src="https://annas-archive.org/assets/blog_imgs/transient_slider.gif" width="100%"/></p>
  <p>This slider, which controls the cutoff frequency of a FIR filter
  effect, is destroyed (freed) when the tabbed window on which it
  appears is dismissed. Under the new model, if I made a change to the
  slider, dismissed the window, and then attempted to undo the change,
  the program would crash.</p>
  <p>I encountered the crash in the course of working on another feature
  (click tracks), and considered it a distraction. So I came up with a
  quick fix that involved keeping these sliders around for <em>just a
  little bit longer</em>, invisibly, until all of the related user
  events were gone too. I did this basically by implementing reference
  counts on the sliders.</p>
  <p>Any attempt to tweak a memory object’s “destroy” or “free” method
  such that the memory isn’t actually freed <em>just yet</em> is a
  canary in the coal mine of bad program design, at least for me. That
  was certainly the case here, though I no longer remember what finally

  result in Jackdaw getting its very own UDP API? That’s the subject of
