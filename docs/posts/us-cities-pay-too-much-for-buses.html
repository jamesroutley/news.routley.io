    <h1>US cities pay too much for buses</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-component="paragraph">In 2023, two transit agencies went shopping for new buses. Denver’s Regional Transportation District (RTD) and the Cincinnati area’s Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) both <a href="https://www.apta.com/research-technical-resources/transit-statistics/vehicle-database/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-component="link">bought</a> 40-foot, diesel-powered vehicles from the same manufacturer. Although the vehicles were similar, their prices were not: RTD’s 10 buses cost $432,028 each, while SORTA’s 17 cost a whopping $939,388 a pop.</p><p data-component="paragraph">That same year, Singapore’s Land Transport Authority also bought buses. Their order called for 240 fully electric vehicles — which are typically twice as expensive as diesel ones in the US. List price: Just $333,000 each. </p></div></div>
