As the much villified theme for star trek enterprise says &#34;its been a long road getting from there to here&#34; i am almost done with all of the work that needed to be done to get us to Catalina compatibility in GNUstep.  The reason this is still significant is because Apple hasn&#39;t made many changes to either the Foundation or AppKit APIs since then.  I have been workinf hard over the last three years.  All of the new classes are fully tested.  Once this effort is completed I am going to focus on printing, which has always been a problem in GS.  And possibly a &#34;reference&#34; distribution.
