A stretch goal would be setting up a blog to document my experiences in those journeys.</p><p>In terms of non-technical skills, I&#39;m thinking of focusing on sales and marketing. Those are fundamental skills, without which any side project I do would be doomed to failure.</p><p>In terms of more creative skills, I have a few already in the &#34;pipeline&#34;: a woobles kit to learn crocheting, a warhammer starter pack to learn miniature painting and a gunpla model kit to learn to properly assemble it.</p></div></div></div>
