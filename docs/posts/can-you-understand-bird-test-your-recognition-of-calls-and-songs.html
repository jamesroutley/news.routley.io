Ornithologists have made progress in understanding the rich variety of ways in which birds converse, thanks in part to large and growing databases of bird calls such as one from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, which includes millions of recordings captured by citizen scientists.</p><p>This summer the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/explain/2023/birds-science">New York Times birding project</a> is encouraging readers to try birding by ear. So here’s a quick tour of the avian soundscape.</p><p>Each bird species has its own distinct set of sounds.
