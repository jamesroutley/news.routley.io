		<p>MOBILE USERS this thing seems to really choke on mobile, so maybe don&#39;t even try</p><p>Some things in this film that you can&#39;t do in a standard video player:</p><p>Unknown runtime</p><p>No rewinding, no skipping ahead</p><p>Extremely dense patterns that would get destroyed by video compression</p><p>Moir√© effects that change if you mess with the zoom setting on your browser</p><p>Effects that change depending on if you&#39;re using flash player or Ruffle</p><p>And more!</p><p>Technical note:</p><p>Most of the effects here are done with gradients, shape tweens, bitmap fills and blending modes, meaning something like this theoretically could have been made as early as 2005 (maybe blending modes came a little later?), though at the time the narration probably would have seemed very weird. It likely wouldn&#39;t have been able to run at 60fps, either.</p><p>There&#39;s almost no code - just the interactive stuff is as3, which I&#39;d never used before this. I&#39;ve decided I hate it.</p><p>Here&#39;s the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/dump/item/721ada80ef7dd602fd9ab40269b9dc05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">source file</a>, if you want a peek behind the curtain (no audio, it makes the file like 20x bigger)</p><p>Big thanks to:</p><ul>
<li>Sarah&#39;s Dad, for letting me use his voice</li>
<li>Bill&#39;s Dad &amp; the rightsholders of Omerp Productions, for letting me use their archive of 2003-era flash files</li>
<li>Harvey for letting me use his music, which you can buy <a href="https://shufflehound.bandcamp.com/album/flights-of-fancy-11-18" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://shufflehound.bandcamp.com/album/jungle-bumble" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a> or listen to free <a href="https://shufflehound.newgrounds.com/audio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">right here on NG</a>
