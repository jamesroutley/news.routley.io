		<p><a id="TA31885" name="TA31885"></a>All information presented here is based on primary sources, mainly original, unmodified Apple disks and other Apple documentation.</p>
		<p>Anyone interested in this history must be especially careful when reviewing the information presented in Apple Knowledge Base article TA31885, <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA31885">Macintosh: System Software Version History</a>, a secondary source that contains major errors:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>In the first table, &#34;System 2.0 Finder 1.1g&#34; should be System 1.1 Finder 1.1g.</li>
  			<li>The first numbered &#34;Macintosh System Software&#34; release was version 5.0 in October 1987. The article assigns <i>ex post facto</i> version numbers to earlier releases and presents a timeline. But the numbers are problematic, and the early timeline is simply not accurate. These mistakes then carry over to Apple&#39;s tech specs and <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/TA41109">other</a> documentation for early Macintosh <a href="#hardware">hardware</a> online. See my discussion of how this mess was made: <a href="https://earlymacintosh.org/cd.html">Apple&#39;s developer CDs and their spawn</a>. </li>

		<p>* System 1.1 supported at least two beta releases of the Finder (Finder 2.6 and Finder 3.4), widely distributed amongst developers, as discussed in <a href="http://preserve.mactech.com/articles/index.html">MacTech</a>: see the Letters sections of Volume 1, Issues 5 and 6.</p>
		<h3>Notes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The two training disks that came with the original January 1984 software bundle (see <a href="#128_bundles">below</a>) used an early version of the Finder. The Macintosh icon is especially interesting, as it appears to show a prototype with a <a href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Hide_Under_This_Desk.txt">5.25&#34; disk drive</a> like the first <a href="http://lowendmac.com/lisa/lisa.shtml">Lisa</a>:</li>

		<ul>
			<li>The System file used on the January 1984 System Disk and Write/Paint disks is, technically, &#34;Version .97 14-Jan-84.&#34; This resource was hidden from the public, for internal reference only. From the point of view of the public, this System file was numbered version 1.0. See the <a href="https://earlymacintosh.org/disk_images.html#1.0">Disk Images</a> page for more information.</li>
			<li>Finder 1.1h appears on the &#34;Guided Tour of Macintosh&#34; training disk, used in all software bundles from May 1984 up to January 1986 (see <a href="#1.1">below</a>).</li>
			<li>System 2.0 Finder 4.1 was released in April 1985. [<a href="https://earlymacintosh.org/disk_images.html#System_2">disk images</a>] MacWrite 4.5 and MacPaint 1.5 were released, along with an update disk that featured the application System Update (a.k.a. Finder Update, its icon appears at the bottom of this page) that could be used to update any startup disk. The Update disk also included the Font/DA Mover application, a Fonts suitcase with one font in it [Taliesin, a pictorial font], and a &#34;What&#39;s New&#34; document. A complete System Disk was not released until June 1985 (see <a href="#E">below</a>).</li>
			<li>System 2.1 Finder 5.0 was released on the first HD 20 Startup disk (with Hard Disk 20 1.0 and HD 20 Test 1.0) that shipped with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170908154008/http://www.vintagemacworld.com/hd20.html">Hard Disk 20</a>. Introduced support for the Hierarchical File System (HFS).</li>
			<li>System 3.0 Finder 5.1 was released on the first Macintosh Plus System Tools disk. This same disk also came with the first <a href="#OEM_upgrades">Macintosh Plus Disk Drive Kit</a>.</li>
			<li><a id="3.1" name="3.1"></a>System 3.1 Finder 5.2 was only released on the Printer Installation (v1.0) [690-5075-A] disk that shipped with the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4R5VAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA6">LaserWriter Plus</a> and featured LaserWriter 3.0 and LaserWriter Namer 2.0, along with an updated Font/DA Mover. Apple intended to ship System 3.1 (or, more likely, System 3.1.1) Finder 5.2 with the first <a href="#Plus_bundles">Macintosh 512K<em>e</em></a> machines, but for unknown reasons they used the earlier Macintosh Plus System Tools disk instead. System 3.1 Finder 5.2 was never released as a System disk, and System 3.1.1 Finder 5.2 is only found on the Macintosh 512K <em>enhanced:</em> A Guided Tour disk.</li>
			<li>System 3.2 Finder 5.3 was released in June 1986. [<a href="https://earlymacintosh.org/disk_images.html#System_3">disk images</a>] In addition to separate 800K System Tools disks for the Macintosh Plus and 512K<i>e,</i> along with a 400K HD 20 Startup disk (with Hard Disk 20 1.1 and HD 20 Test 1.1), Apple distributed two 400K update disks:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>The System Installation (v1.0) disk came with two Installer scripts: &#34;Mac Plus Update&#34; and &#34;External Drive.&#34;</li>
				  	<li>The Printer Installation (v1.1) [690-5075-B] disk featured LaserWriter 3.1 and LaserWriter Namer 2.1.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>The earliest references to &#34;Macintosh System Software&#34; are in the Read Me documents on the System 4.0 Finder 5.4 and System 4.1 Finder 5.5 disks.</li>
			<li>System 4.0 Finder 5.4 was released in January 1987. It came on two 800K disks:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Macintosh System Tools (v1.0)</li>
					<li>Macintosh Utilities (v1.0)</li>
				</ul>
			<li>System 4.1 Finder 5.5 was released in April 1987. [<a href="https://earlymacintosh.org/disk_images.html#System_4">disk images</a>] It came on two 800K disks:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Macintosh System Tools (v2.0). Revised June 1987 (v2.0.1).</li>
					<li>Macintosh Utilities (v2.0). Revised June 1987 (v2.0.1). Revised August 1987 (v2.1, two disks).</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Macintosh System Software 5.0 and 5.1 came on four 800K disks: System Tools 1, System Tools 2 (Printers), Utilities 1, Utilities 2.</li>
			<li>Macintosh System Software 6.0–6.0.5 came on four 800K disks: System Tools, Printing Tools, Utilities 1, Utilities 2. [<a href="https://earlymacintosh.org/disk_images.html#System_6">disk images</a>]</li>
			<li>Macintosh System Software 6.0.7–6.0.8 came on two 1.4 Mb (high-density) disks: System Startup and System Additions.
		Four 800K disks were also available. [<a href="https://earlymacintosh.org/disk_images.html#System_6">disk images</a>]</li>
		</ul>
		<p><a id="A-1" name="A-1"></a>Throughout 1987, Apple considered System file 3.2 (or 3.3 as an AppleShare client) to be the maximum for machines with 512K memory. By early 1988, however, this recommendation had been changed to System file 4.1:</p>

		<p>The following information reflects the current state of my knowledge of Macintosh 128K [M0001 and M0001P] &#34;Mac&#34; and 512K [M0001W and M0001WP] &#34;Fat Mac&#34; hardware. It may not be complete, but it is accurate, based on personal experience and detailed reports from others, along with conclusions gleaned from the <a href="http://www.mac128.com/m0001">M0001 Registry</a>.</p>
		<p>There were three cases:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Early M0001 cases that read &#34;Macintosh&#34; on the back.</li>
			<li>Later M0001 cases that read &#34;Macintosh 128K&#34; on the back. This change was made in week 47 of 1984 (November).</li>
			<li>M0001W cases that read &#34;Macintosh 512K&#34; on the back.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There were (at least) three generations of logic boards:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>[820-0086-C] © 1983, 128K (630-0101) only.</li>
			<li>[820-0086-F] © 1983-84, could be configured as either 128K (630-0101) or 512K (630-0118) boards.</li>
			<li>[820-0141-A] © 1983-84, could be configured as either 128K (630-0101) or 512K (630-0118) boards.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>There were (at least) two generations of 128K/512K analog boards (630-0102):</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>[820-0082-B] © 1983, had a metal shield that ran along the top at BB1. Apple later removed the shield to increase convective cooling.</li>
		  <li>[820-0082-C] © 1983-84, had neither the shield nor BB1.</li>
		</ol>
    	<p>There were two generations of disk drives:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Early Sony model OA-D34V.</li>
			<li>Later Sony models OA-D34V-02 or OA-D34V-22. These models had a new insert/eject mechanism.</li>
    	</ol>
		<p>There were two series of external disk drives (model M0130):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Serial number started with D, made in USA.* The earliest of these contained Sony OA-D34V drives. Later they contained OA-D34V-02/22 drives.</li>
			<li>Serial number started with Y, made in Japan.* These contained Sony OA-D34V-02/22 drives.</li>
		</ol>
		<blockquote>
			<p>* There is a difference between the two in the coloration of the plastic case. The plastic used for the D drives is the same as that used for early Macintosh machines. The plastic used for the Y drives is slightly different and does not yellow, at least not nearly as much.</p>

		<p>The first Macintosh 128K machines came with a plastic box that included:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>690-5003A &#34;System Disk&#34; disk: System 1.0 Finder 1.0 [<a href="https://earlymacintosh.org/disk_images.html#1.0">more info</a>]</li>

		<p>MacWrite and MacPaint came in a cardboard box that included:</p>

		</ul>
		<p>Font Mover was included on the MacWrite MacPaint (Write/Paint) disk.</p>
		<p><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>In May 1984, the software bundle was updated and reorganized for System 1.1 Finder 1.1g. Font Mover and the additional fonts were moved to the System Disk in order to create more space on the MacWrite MacPaint disk and a new MacPaint disk was added. The two audio tapes remained the same [with the recordings updated?], and MacWrite MacPaint still came in a separate box:</p>

		<p>In September 1984, with the introduction of the Macintosh 512K, the bundle was changed so that all the components would fit inside the plastic Macintosh box:</p>

		<p>* There is no difference in content between the 690-5003B, 690-5003-C, and 690-5003-D disks. The different part numbers reflect changes in the packaging.</p>
		<p><a id="E" name="E"></a>In June 1985, the software bundle was updated for System 2.0 Finder 4.1. The training disks and audio tape remained the same:</p>

		<h2><a id="Plus_hardware" name="Plus_hardware"></a><SPAN color="#00008b">Macintosh Plus and 512K<i>e</i> hardware</SPAN></h2>
		<h3>Macintosh Plus</h3>
		<p>All original Macintosh Plus [M0001A and M0001AP] machines had the words &#34;Macintosh Plus&#34; on the front and came with the M0110A extended keyboard. There were three generations:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>&#34;Beige&#34; Macintosh Plus machines read &#34;Macintosh Plus 1 Mb&#34; on the back, with no copyright date. Beige was also the color of the Macintosh 128K and 512K, as well as the 512K<i>e.</i></li>
			<li>In 1987, Apple changed the label on the back to read &#34;Macintosh Plus 1 Mb&#34; with a 1987 copyright date. The case color was changed to &#34;platinum&#34; to match the color of the new Macintosh II and SE machines. The owner&#39;s guide was redesigned and revised (see below).</li>
			<li>In 1988, Apple changed the label on the back to read &#34;Macintosh Plus&#34; with a 1988 copyright date. The owner&#39;s guide was redesigned and revised again (see below).</li>
		</ol>
		<p>The Macintosh Plus ROMs were revised twice. The second revision coincided with the release of the platinum machines in 1987.</p>
		<h3><a id="e" name="e"></a>Macintosh 512K<i>e</i></h3>
		<p>There were two generations of Macintosh 512K<i>e</i> [M0001E] machines:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Beige machines produced in 1986 have a label on the back with no copyright date. They came with the M0110 standard keyboard and contained first-revision Macintosh Plus ROMs. The location and design of the Apple logo on the front was the same as the original Macintosh and the 512K.</li>
			<li>Platinum machines have a 1987 copyright date on the label. They came with the M0110A extended keyboard and contained second-revision Macintosh Plus ROMs. The location and design of the Apple logo on the front was the same as the Plus.</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> I have never seen a M0001E with a 220-240V power supply.</p>
    	<h3><a id="800" name="800"></a>Macintosh 512K/800</h3>
		<p>The Macintosh 512K/800 [M0001D or M0001E, depending on the power supply required locally] was a 512K<i>e</i> with a M0110A extended keyboard. To my knowledge, the 512K/800 was never sold retail in the United States. Like the first-generation 512K<i>e</i>, the location and design of the Apple logo on the front was the same as the original Macintosh and the 512K.</p>
		<p>The M0001D probably existed as a second-generation, platinum 1987 machine, but I have never seen one without &#34;Macintosh ED&#34; (see below) printed on the front.</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> I have never seen a M0001D with a 110-120V power supply.</p>
		<h3><a id="ED" name="ED"></a>Macintosh ED</h3>
		<p>The Macintosh ED was a 512K/800 sold to educational institutions, mostly, if not entirely [?], outside of the United States. There were four editions of these machines:</p>
		<ol>
		  <li>Beige with M0001ED model number. [Serial numbers begin with F, for Fremont, California]</li>
          <li>Platinum with M0001ED model number.</li>
	      <li>Beige with &#34;Macintosh ED&#34; printed on the front and M0001D model number on the back. [Serial numbers begin with C, for Cork, Ireland.]</li>
          <li>Platinum with &#34;Macintosh ED&#34; printed on the front and M0001D model number on the back.*</li>
		</ol>
		<p>* A 1987 Dutch edition of the &#34;Macintosh ED Addendum&#34; booklet, covering System 4.0 Finder 5.4, has come to light. You can download a PDF at <a href="http://macintoshgarden.org/apps/macintosh-ed-addendum-manual-only-dutch">Macintosh Garden</a>.
		</p><h3>Macintosh Plus ED</h3>
		<p>The Macintosh Plus ED was a platinum Macintosh Plus with &#34;Macintosh Plus ED&#34; printed on the front.</p>
		<p><strong>Note:</strong> I have never seen a Macintosh Plus ED with a 110-120V power supply.</p>

		<p>Sales of the Macintosh 512K<i>e</i> continued until September 1987. Apple did not update the 512K<em>e</em> owner&#39;s guide along with that of the Macintosh Plus. At the time, Apple considered System 3.2 Finder 5.3 to be the maximum for machines with 512K of memory. [It was only <a href="#software">later</a> that System 4.1 Finder 5.4 was declared the maximum.] This fact may explain why no effort was made to update the 512K<em>e</em> owner&#39;s guide and software bundle for the second-generation 512K<em>e</em> in 1987 (see <a href="#e">above</a>), while the Plus received a complete overhaul.</p>

					<li>Replaced 128K logic board with 512K logic board.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>[Macintosh Plus Disk Drive Kit]</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Result was equivalent to a Macintosh 512K<i>e</i>. Could also be performed on a Macintosh 128K, resulting in a Macintosh 128K<i>e</i>.</li>
					<li>Replaced 400K internal disk drive with 800K internal disk drive.</li>
					<li>Replaced 64K ROM chips with 128K ROM chips on the logic board.</li>
					<li>Included current Macintosh Plus System Tools disk.</li>
					<li>Included 030-1245-A or 030-1245-B [Macintosh Plus Internal Disk Drive] upgrade guide, 43 pp. © 1986. A thorough introduction to Finder 5.x and the Hierarchical File System (HFS).*</li>
				</ul>
			<li>[Macintosh Plus 1 Mb Logic Board Kit]</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Result was equivalent to a Macintosh Plus.</li>
					<li>Macintosh 128K/512K required Macintosh Plus Disk Drive Kit (above).</li>
					<li>Replaced 128K/512K/512K<i>e</i> logic board with Plus logic board.</li>
					<li>Replaced 128K/512K/512K<i>e</i> back panel with Plus back panel. Machines upgraded with this kit thus read &#34;Macintosh Plus 1 Mb&#34; on the back, but don&#39;t say &#34;Macintosh Plus&#34; on the front.</li>
					<li>Included current Macintosh Plus owner&#39;s guide.</li>
				</ul>
			<li>Macintosh Plus memory upgrades. Result was a Macintosh Plus with up to 4 Mb of memory.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Replaced 256K plug-in memory modules with 1 Mb modules. You could replace either two or four modules, resulting in 2560K (2.5 Mb) or 4096K (4 Mb) of memory.</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<p><a id="_400K_HFS" name="_400K_HFS"></a>* As far as I know, this is the only printed Apple manual that tells you how to initialize single-sided 400K disks in the HFS format. Requires Finder 5.x or 6.x: &#34;Holding down the Option key while you click One-Sided (or if the disk is in a 400K disk drive, holding the Option key down while you press the Return key after you&#39;ve named it) installs the hierarchical file system on just one side of the disk. Use disks initialized this way with updated startup disks only.&#34; In other words, they can&#39;t be used as startup disks. Or else!</p>
