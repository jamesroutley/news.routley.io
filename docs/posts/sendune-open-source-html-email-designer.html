Code: <a href="https://github.com/SendWithSES/Drag-and-Drop-Email-Designer">https://github.com/SendWithSES/Drag-and-Drop-Email-Designer</a></p><p>HTML for email is probably the hardest code to write. Even a teeny-tiny deviation from the rules will break the email in untold combination of os/desktop/mobile clients.</p><p>It&#39;s mid 2024. Almost 50 years since email was invented and 35 years since HTML was born. A &#39;basic-open-source-HTML-email-designer&#39; must be a solved problem, right? We thought so too.</p><p>Sadly, that&#39;s not the case.</p><p>There are a few decent open source email designers but they carry dependencies that make them cumbersome to embed within your app. That&#39;s why we decided to open source our HTML Email Designer.</p><p>The SENDUNE email designer focuses on simplicity and ease of use. It is light-weight. It does pure HTML - no intermediate code wranglers like mjml. There is no lock-in of any kind. Save HTML output as a template and use with ANY email service provider.</p><p>Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests.</p><p>AMA: hello at sendune dot com</p></div></div></div>
