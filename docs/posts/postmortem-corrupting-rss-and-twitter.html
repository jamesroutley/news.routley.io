    <h1>Postmortem: Corrupting RSS And Twitter</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>As some of you might have noticed, I corrupted my RSS and Twitter feed last week. It’s an embarassing and cautionary tale, so it’s worth telling.</p>
<p>First, a word about my setup. I wrote a simple static site generator that takes my markdown files and compiles them to HTML, inlining them into a layout file. That’s all that’s on the server, no database or anything like that. All of the software on my blog can be found <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/blog">here</a>.</p>
<p>So how do I get to an RSS feed and a Twitter bot from there? Whenever I publish a post, I run <a href="https://github.com/hellerve/blog/blob/master/rsser/rsser.py">this script</a>. It looks at the date when the file was last modified and uses that as the RSS date. This isn’t the best solution, of course, but it’s simple and foolproof. It’s good enough for my setup in which I write the posts once and don’t touch them again after publishing. Or at least that’s what I thought.</p>
<p>The Twitter feed is generated in a similar way. It checks which posts are younger than a certain number of hours, and posts a notification on Twitter for my dearly beloved followers.</p>
<p>Of course nothing is ever as easy as you think it will be.</p>
<p>As detailed in <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/PSA_VI.html">this PSA</a>, I decided to roll out HTTPS after a few friends of mine asked me to. I wrote the PSA and then realized that I link to the HTTP version of this blog everywhere. “I know how to fix this”, I thought to myself, not thinking of the RSS or Twitter feed generator, and wrote a sed expression to change each occurrence of “http://blog.veitheller.de” in my blog posts to “//blog.veitheller.de”. A quick fix, noone will know.</p>
<p>Then I decided to write a quick blog post advertising the change; in less than an hour, I had it written, edited, and published. I ran through the script, which took unusually long. I suspected that the Twitter API was a bit slower than usual, that there was a connection error of some sort. Finally it was done. I looked at Twitter to verify that it had indeed been published; I saw nearly 70 new tweets.</p>
<p>I knew what had happenend immediately. It’s weird how I hadn’t thought about it before, but once I saw what had happened, I knew what was wrong in the blink of an eye: <code>sed</code> had touched every file, and my scripts thought they were all new.</p>
<p>I spent a few minutes cleaning up the mess on Twitter. My RSS feed is still not fixed. Sorry if it affected you; you now know who to blame.</p>
