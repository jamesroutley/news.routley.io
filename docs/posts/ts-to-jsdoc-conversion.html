          <p dir="auto">Happened to see this on Twitter during lunch. I maintain the VS Code JS debugger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">when using the debugging function of VSCode, , it is necessary to debug with a built program, which makes it difficult to know where we are and we need to go back to original program every time when we want to fix something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">It&#39;s an aside from the main PR, but I&#39;m not entirely sure what you mean here. This should not exclude the ability to use alternative TS compilers--in fact, the js debugger itself is built with esbuild. The debugger should also handle runtime transpilers (like <a href="https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx">tsx</a>) just fine.</p>
<p dir="auto">One snag you might hit with npm link is that by default we don&#39;t follow sourcemaps in node_modules for performance reasons, but this can be adjusted by setting <code>resourceSourceMapLocations: null</code> (overriding its default) in your launch.json. Anyhow, if you&#39;re running into places where the debugger doesn&#39;t seem to work, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug/issues">open an issue</a>.</p>
