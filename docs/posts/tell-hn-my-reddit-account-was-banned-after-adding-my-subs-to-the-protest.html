    <h1>Tell HN: My Reddit account was banned after adding my subs to the protest</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As you may be aware, there is an upcoming protest[0] on June 12-14 where many subreddits[1] are going private for 48 hours in protest of reddit&#39;s API fee increase[2][3], which many expect will lead to the end of all third party apps.</p><p>I moderate a few subreddits for a niche hobby, and decided to join the protest. We&#39;re fairly small, if non-negligible potatos: altogether, maybe 10k-15k active users on a busy day, but still want to show support.</p><p>So, I commented to add the subs to the list[1] and made announcement posts based on the template[4] linked from r/modcoord.</p><p>Several minutes later, the site logged me out. I received an email from reddit that said my account had been locked for &#34;suspicious activity&#34; and I would need to reset my password.</p><p>The timing seemed curious, but as I was logged in over an Airbnb&#39;s wifi, I figured it could be legitimate.</p><p>When I logged back in, I saw that all of the posts and comments I&#39;ve made from this account had been deleted. The password reset requirement is understandable; the fact that the posts and comments were not restored, less so.</p><p>Looks like it&#39;s finally time to encourage my community to move to another site.</p><p>0. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36187705" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36187705</a></p><p>1. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/" rel="nofollow">https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplet...</a></p><p>2. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/" rel="nofollow">https://old.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_l...</a></p><p>3. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/evilbuildings/comments/140n3m3/hey_reddit_execs_stop_being_greedy_assholes_this/jmwbkpv/" rel="nofollow">https://old.reddit.com/r/evilbuildings/comments/140n3m3/hey_...</a></p><p>4. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/ProCSS/wiki/api_protest_template" rel="nofollow">https://old.reddit.com/r/ProCSS/wiki/api_protest_template</a></p></div></div></div>
