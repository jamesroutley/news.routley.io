        <p dir="ltr">Hi LinkedIn connections! I am ready for my next journey with your company!

After I received an offer from Alexa AI, I expressed my intention for an internal transfer to my manager at my current AWS team. Since it is performance review season at Amazon, he quickly sent me into a dev plan (PIP) and blackmailed to my future manager and their supervisor.

He has PIP quotas to fill and luckily, dead people can&#39;t talk! Yay!

So now I am open to work! Recruiters, if you have a job opening that needs a software engineer with solid programming skills, send me a DM!

Setting delivery deadline for Monday morning on Friday afternoon? Easy!
Paging at 2AM on Saturday? No problem!
Being oncall every 4 weeks for a team that lost 50% developers over one year? Piece of cake!
I only have one humble request, if I submited 51k lines of code in January and my whole team submitted 68k, do not call me a &#34;Least Effective&#34;.

Recruiters from Amazon are not welcome, your understanding is much appreciated.

(Since I was warned to take down this post, so here is a disclaimer: This LinkedIn account serves my personal purpose to establish effective social interaction with professionals throughout the industry, all my statements are purely based on my personal experience and not indicating any individual or team, all my words can be true, and they can be biased, please have your own judgment)

(I didn&#39;t expect this post to go on trend, thank you everyone for reaching out to me to provide help. Repost/share is ok, but do not add your own imagination or try to be a story teller. I am already aware of cyberbullying, you are not helping me by hurting more people.)
