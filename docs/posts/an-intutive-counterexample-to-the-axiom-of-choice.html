<p>Time for some hard-core geeking-out.</p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34484011" target="_blank">This comment on HN</a> by /u/jiggawatts struck me as a brilliant idea: it&#39;s an intuitive counter-example to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_Choice" target="_blank">axiom of choice</a>, which seem intuitively obvious, but leads to weird results like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox" target="_blank">Banach-Tarski paradox</a>.</p><p>For those of you who are not hard-core geeks, the axiom of choice says (more or less) that if you are given a collection of non-empty sets, you can choose a member from each of those sets.  That seems eminently plausible.  How could it possibly <i>not</i> be true?</p><p>Here&#39;s how: consider the set of numbers that cannot be described using any finite collection of symbols.  Such numbers must exist because there are only a countably infinite number of numbers that <i>can</i> be described using a finite collection of symbols, but there are an uncountably infinite number of real numbers.  So not only are there numbers that cannot be described using a finite number of symbols, there are vastly more of these than numbers that can be so described.</p><p>And yet... how would you describe such a number?  <i>By definition</i> it is not possible!  And so it is not at all clear (at least not to me) what it would even <i>mean</i> to &#34;choose&#34; a number from this set.</p><p>This is, of course, not a proof that the axiom of choice is wrong.  It&#39;s an axiom.  It can&#39;t be wrong.  But it is a good example for casting doubt in its intuitive plausibility, and that feels like progress to me.<br/></p>
