When a user searches on the App Store, your ad can appear at the top of their search results. And starting in 2026, we’ll be introducing more ads to increase opportunity in search results. </p>

                    <p>Search is the way most people find and download apps on the App Store, with nearly 65 percent of downloads happening directly after a search. To help give advertisers more opportunities to drive downloads from search results, Apple Ads will introduce additional ads across search queries. You don’t need to change your campaign in order to be eligible for any new positions. Your ad will run in either the existing position — at the top of search results — or further down in search results. If you have a search results campaign running, your ad will be automatically eligible for all available positions, but you can’t select or bid for a particular one.

                    <p>A default ad is created based on your app’s product page, or you can create ad variations from custom product pages you set up in App Store Connect. Ad variations allow you to align ad creative with specific audiences and keyword themes. You can also select a custom product page with a deep link that directs users to the exact place you want in your app. Deep links for search results placements are available on devices running iOS or iPadOS 18 and later.</p>
