    <h1>How Trump&#39;s second term just made digital sovereignty a European priority</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Donald Trump is back, and the global digital landscape is about to shift. While the new administration hasn‚Äôt explicitly addressed data sovereignty yet, one thing is clear: global data flows are about to get a lot more complicated. If his last term is any indication, we can expect a renewed focus on economic protectionism, national security, and an ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù approach to technology. For companies and governments outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, this raises a big question: <strong>How can we keep control of our own data when U.S. laws reach far beyond American borders?</strong></p><h2 id="HTrump2019sreturnandtheCLOUDActimpact"><span>Trump‚Äôs return and the CLOUD Act impact</span></h2><p>During his previous term, Trump‚Äôs administration left a lasting mark on tech policy. The <strong><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act">CLOUD Act of 2018</a></span></strong> lets U.S. authorities demand data from American companies even when that data is stored in Europe. This means¬†that even if European businesses follow strict rules like¬†GDPR, European data can still fall under U.S. legal scrutiny. In simple terms, relying on U.S. cloud services exposes European data to foreign legal demands and political pressure.</p><p>With Trump‚Äôs return, expect more executive orders and potential sanctions targeting companies that resist U.S. demands. The risk is clear: continuing to depend on U.S. tech giants may turn European digital assets into geopolitical pawns.</p><blockquote><p>üõë What if tomorrow, the U.S. government forced Microsoft to block access to all data and Europe is left behind? üõë What happens if U.S. cloud services become a geopolitical weapon, just like sanctions against Huawei?</p></blockquote><p>These aren‚Äôt far-fetched scenarios. <strong>They‚Äôre a wake-up call.</strong></p><h2 id="HCanEuropebreakfreefromU.S.BigTech3F"><span>Can Europe break free from U.S. Big Tech?</span></h2><p>Europe has long prided itself on strong data protection and fair competition through regulations like¬†GDPR. But until now, Europe has been too slow to act. Despite the talk of digital sovereignty, many European organizations, businesses and governments continue <span><a href="https://www.capacitymedia.com/article/polands-700m-microsoft-deal-sparks-eu-digital-sovereignty-concerns">to sign contracts with Microsoft</a></span>, Google, and Atlassian, not realizing the fact that trusting U.S. providers puts their digital sovereignty at risk.</p><p>At the same time, new initiatives like the <span><a href="https://digital-markets-act.ec.europa.eu/index_en">Digital Markets Act</a></span>¬†and <span><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital-services-act-package">Digital Services Act</a></span>, alongside investments in local cloud solutions, are positive steps toward protecting European data, but talk is cheap without decisive action. Here&#39;s how European organizations and governments can make a difference:</p><p><strong>‚úÖ Investing in open-source solutions to reduce dependency on proprietary U.S. solutions</strong></p><p>Ludovic our CEO, puts it bluntly:</p><blockquote><p>Europe loves to talk about sovereignty but keeps handing its digital future to American companies. If we‚Äôre serious about this, we need to stop outsourcing our entire tech stack to Silicon Valley.</p></blockquote><h2 id="HOpensourceasthepathtodigitalsovereignty"><span>Open source as the path to digital sovereignty</span></h2><p>Here‚Äôs the blunt truth: If Europe truly wants control, it must build an open and independent digital ecosystem. Open-source software delivers unmatched transparency, as you can inspect the code, host it yourself, and tailor it exactly to your needs. No hidden costs, no forced features, you&#39;re in full control.</p><p>Initiatives like <span><a href="https://opendesk.eu/en/">openDesk</a></span> from Zentrum Digitale Souver√§nit√§t are already proving that Europe can build a secure digital ecosystem with tools like <strong><span><a href="https://xwiki.com/en/try-xwiki/">XWiki</a></span></strong>, <span><a href="https://cryptpad.org/try-cloud/">CryptPad</a></span>,¬†<span><a href="https://www.openproject.org/">OpenProject</a></span>, and <span><a href="https://nextcloud.com/">NextCloud</a></span>¬†that are secure, open-source, independent alternatives to American platforms.</p><p>As Ludovic always says,</p><blockquote><p>If we want control, we must build our own open and independent digital ecosystem.</p></blockquote><h2 id="HReclaimingdigitalsovereignty"><span>Reclaiming digital sovereignty</span></h2><p>The current geopolitical context is an unmistakable signal that our current dependency on foreign technology providers is a critical vulnerability. For over 20 years, we‚Äôve observed the pitfalls of ceding control to external tech giants whose policies, like the CLOUD Act, leave our data exposed to unforeseen legal and political pressures.</p><p>The reality is clear! U.S. legal overreach can extend its influence far beyond its borders, jeopardizing the integrity of data stored in Europe. This isn&#39;t just about policy, it‚Äôs about the very foundation of digital trust and national security. With every outsourced service, we risk surrendering a bit more of our digital autonomy.</p><p>This is a defining moment for Europe‚Äôs digital landscape. The era of hoping U.S. tech companies will ‚Äúplay fair‚Äù is over. Europe must own its digital future, or risk losing it entirely. The solution is as straightforward as it is challenging: invest in open-source technologies, develop efficient, locally governed cloud infrastructures, and enforce open standards that secure our digital assets. History has shown that true innovation and resilience come from owning and understanding the very tools we use.</p><p>The choices made today will echo in the security and strength of tomorrow‚Äôs digital world.</p><hr/><h2 id="HBeforeyougo..."><span>Before you go...</span></h2><p>If topics like knowledge management, open-source alternatives, accessibility, or remote work pique your interest, why not become part of our community?<strong>¬†</strong><span><a href="https://xwiki.com/en/Blog/"><strong>Subscribe to our monthly newsletter</strong></a></span>¬†and stay in the loop with insights, tips, and updates!
