    <h1>TikTok tracked users who watched gay content, prompting employee complaints</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-type="paragraph">For at least a year, some employees at TikTok were able to find what they described internally as a list of users who watch gay content on the popular app, a collection of information that sparked worker complaints, according to former TikTok employees.  </p><p data-type="paragraph">TikTok doesn’t ask users to disclose their sexual orientation, but it cataloged videos users watched under topics such as LGBT, short for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender, the former employees said. The collection of information, which could be viewed by some employees through a dashboard, included a set of affiliated users who watched those videos, and their ID numbers, they said.</p></section><p>Copyright ©<!-- -->2023<!-- --> Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc.
