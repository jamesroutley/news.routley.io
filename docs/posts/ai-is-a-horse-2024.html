<h2>AI is a horse</h2>
<p>AI is a horse.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is faster than your feet depending on the terrain</li>
  <li>It is way slower and less reliable than a train but can go more places</li>
  <li>It eats a lot</li>
  <li>You cannot simply tell it to go to the store for you</li>
  <li>You have to tell it where to turn even if it might guess right sometimes</li>
  <li>You have to keep it on the road even if it usually stays on the road</li>
  <li>You can only lead it to water, you cannot make it drink</li>
  <li>A good one runs at the shadow of the whip</li>
  <li>We are skeptical of those that talk</li>
</ul>
