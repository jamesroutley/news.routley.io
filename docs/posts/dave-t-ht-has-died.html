									<p>04/01/2025</p><p>We are devastated to report that Dave Täht has passed away.</p><p>Dave was an amazing man, helping the world with FQ-CoDel and CAKE, fighting bufferbloat and trying to make the world a better place. Always willing to help, and without him – LibreQoS (and the other QoE solutions out there) wouldn’t exist.</p><p>Dave was an inspiration, and we all miss him. We’re reaching out to family and close friends to see if there’s anything we can do to help.</p><p>Dave was an inspiration to us. Dave’s contributions to Linux, FQ-CoDel, and CAKE improved internet connectivity around the world for millions of people. Because of him, millions of people now have access to reliable video calls – and in turn, access to loved ones, healthcare, and community. One of Robert’s ISP customers is a kind paraplegic woman who lives in a far-flung rural Colonia near El Paso, Texas. Her reliable access to her doctors through telemedicine, and to her family through FaceTime, was only made possible because of his algorithms. There are millions of cases like hers, where Dave’s contributions have silently enabled human connection and safety. Everything Dave contributed to the world of technology was free and open source, for the betterment of humanity.</p><p>Dave is the reason that Starlink was able to tackle its latency issues – enabling a generation of young entrepreneurs across the developing world, such as these young folks pictured in the Phillipines, to start their own ISPs to expand internet access to their communities. Dave started work on FQ-CoDel in part because of his own journey working to expand internet access in Nicaragua, so we know he saw that his work had come full-circle and helped so many.</p><p>We’re incredibly grateful to have Dave as our friend, mentor, and as someone who continuously inspired us – showing us that we could do better for each other in the world, and leverage technology to make that happen. He will be dearly missed.</p><p><strong>PS:</strong> Dave is forever in our hearts and souls, in our routers and… in production. <strong><a href="https://github.com/LibreQoE/LibreQoS/pull/684" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/LibreQoE/LibreQoS/pull/684</a> </strong>We will miss you so much, Dave.</p><p>– Robert, Herbert, and Frank with LibreQoS</p>								</div>
