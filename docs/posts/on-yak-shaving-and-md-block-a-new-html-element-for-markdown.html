<p>This week has been <a href="https://americanexpress.io/yak-shaving/">Yak Shaving</a> Galore. It went a bit like this:</p>



<ol><li>I’ve been working on a web component that I need for the project I’m working on. More on that later, but let’s call it <code>&lt;x-foo&gt;</code> for now.</li><li><em>Of course</em> that needs to be developed as a separate reusable library and released as a separate open source project. No, this is not the titular component, this was only level 1 of my multi-level yak shaving… 🤦🏽‍♀️</li><li>I wanted to showcase various usage examples of that component in its page, so I made another component for these demos: <code>&lt;x-foo-live&gt;</code>. This demo component would have markup with editable parts on one side and the live rendering on the other side.</li><li>I wanted the editable parts to autosize as you type. Hey, I’ve written a library for that in the past, it’s called <a href="https://github.com/leaverou/stretchy/">Stretchy</a>! </li><li>But Stretchy was not written in ESM, nor did it support Shadow DOM. I must rewrite Stretchy in ESM and support Shadow DOM first! Surely it won’t take more than a half hour, it’s a tiny library.</li><li><em>(It took more than a half hour)</em></li><li>Ok, now I have a nice lil’ module, but I also need to export IIFE as well, so that it’s compatible with Stretchy v1. Let’s switch to Rollup and npm scripts and ditch Gulp.</li><li>Oh look, Stretchy’s CSS is still written in Sass, even though it doesn’t really need it now. Let’s rewrite it to use CSS variables, use PostCSS for nesting, and use <code>conic-gradient()</code> instead of inline SVG data URIs.</li><li>Ok, Stretchy v2 is ready, now I need to update its docs. Oooh, it doesn’t have a README? I should add one. But I don’t want to duplicate content between the page and the README. Hmmm, if only…</li><li>I know! I’ll make a web component for rendering both inline and remote Markdown! I have an unfinished one lying around somewhere, surely it won’t take more than a couple hours to finish it?</li><li><em>(It took almost a day, two with docs, demos etc)</em></li><li><em>Done!</em> Here it is! <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://md-block.verou.me/" target="_blank">https://md-block.verou.m</a><a href="https://md-block.verou.me/">e</a></li><li><em>Great!</em> Now I can update <a href="https://stretchy.verou.me/">Stretchy’s docs</a> and <a href="https://github.com/LeaVerou/stretchy/releases/tag/v2.0.0">release its v2</a></li><li><em>Great!</em> Now I can use Stretchy in my <code>&lt;x-foo-live&gt;</code> component demoing my <code>&lt;x-foo&gt;</code> component and be back to only one level of yak shaving!</li><li><em>Wow, it’s already Friday afternoon?!</em> 🤦🏽‍♀️😂</li></ol>



<p>Hopefully you find <a href="https://md-block.verou.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&lt;md-block&gt;</a> useful! Enjoy!</p>
