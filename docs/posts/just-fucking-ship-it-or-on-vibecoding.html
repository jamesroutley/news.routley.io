    <h1>&#34;Just Fucking Ship IT&#34; (Or: On Vibecoding)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I have minimal experience with exploitation or security research- some techniques employed in this write-up are almost certainly suboptimal. This is not a tutorial, do not treat it as such. Sensitive information has been censored as best as possible.</p>

<p>Earlier in the year I attended a hackathon organized by my university&#39;s IEEE branch. My team and I managed to hack together a pretty decent submission, and for our efforts, we were rewarded with <a href="https://github.com/coal-rock/latex-tutor">second place</a>. Among the submissions, a one <a href="https://devpost.com/software/mentora-eu1v49">Mentora</a> piqued my interest. Mentora marketed itself as an &#34;AI tutor&#34;, seeking to gamify quizzes and provide personalized lesson plans using, you guessed it, large language models.</p>
<p>Interested, I began to explore the &#34;How we built it&#34; section of the Devpost. React Native, Supabase, and OpenAI integration. Yup! This <strong>reeks</strong> of vibe coder slop. Unfortunately, Mentora never seemed to see the light of day. Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/christianmonfiston/">our hero</a> didn&#39;t stop there, and this time he&#39;s breaking into the social media market. Enter: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pandu-make-friends-and-play/id6739809617"><em>Pandu</em></a>.</p>
<h2>What even is Pandu?</h2>
<p>Much like Mentora, Pandu is a pretty generic take on an existing genre <em>but with more AI slop</em>. Disappointingly, there is yet to be an Android release of Pandu, and given that I don&#39;t own any Apple devices, investigating this might be a little rough.</p>

<p>Apparently, Apple&#39;s <code>IPA</code> format is encrypted, meaning that blindly pulling files from a server and expecting to be able to read them isn&#39;t going to work. Luckily, someone has managed to automate this process of decrypting these bundles and has even been so kind as to expose the tooling behind a Telegram bot.</p>
<p><img src="https://macwright.com/assets/pandu_ipa_dump.png" alt="Dumping Pandu IPA"/></p>
<p>After acquiring the decrypted IPA, I simply suffixed the file with <code>.zip</code> and extracted it:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>unzip</span></span><span> pandu_ipa_v103.ipa.zip</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>The archive yielded a <code>Payload/</code> folder, with the following structure:</p>
<p><img src="https://macwright.com/assets/pandu_dump_tree.png" alt="Pandu Dump Folder Tree"/></p>
<p>The main file of interest here is the <code>main.jsbundle</code>, which appears to be a JavaScript bundle compiled with Hermes. After a quick pass with <a href="https://github.com/P1sec/hermes-dec/">hermes-dec</a>, I was left with a mostly readable blob of pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>python</span></span><span> hbc_decompiler.py ./Payload/Pandu.app/main.jsbundle pandu_decomp.js</span>
</span></code></pre>
<hr/>

<p>I began my search by looking for very low-hanging fruit. Surely an app published on the App Store wouldn&#39;t expose an OpenAI key, right?</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>grep</span></span><span> <span><span>&#34;</span>&#39;sk-<span>&#34;</span></span> pandu_decomp.js</span>
</span></code></pre>
<pre><code><span>r11 = &#39;sk-proj-*************************************************&#39;;
</span></code></pre>
<p>WHAT? There. Is. No. Way.</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>curl</span></span><span> <span><span>&#34;</span>https://api.openai.com/v1/responses<span>&#34;</span></span> <span>\

        &#34;input&#34;: &#34;Write me a haiku about why it is not a great idea to hard-code OpenAI API keys into client-facing applications.&#34;

</span></code></pre>
<p>So it turns out that all the fancy LLM integration is handled client-side, with the users&#39; device issuing the OpenAI API queries and forwarding the output to the &#34;backend&#34; (if you can even call it that, I&#39;ll get to this later).</p>
<p>Now that we know that LLM queries are handled client-side, it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to pull out the system prompt.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An LLM prompt isn&#39;t exactly &#34;valuable information,&#34; and &#34;prompt engineering&#34; is most definitely not a skill- Nonetheless I&#39;m expecting this to be quite funny.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#34;You are a Gen Z App, You are Pandu,you are helping a user spark conversations with a new user, you are not cringe and you are not too forward, be human-like. You generate 1 short, trendy, and fun conversation starter. It should be under 100 characters and should not be unfinished. It should be tailored to the user&#39;s vibe or profile info. Keep it casual or playful and really gen z use slangs and emojis. No Quotation mark&#34;</p>
<p>I wonder what prompted him to tell the model not to be cringe.</p>

<p>If you aren&#39;t familiar, Supabase is a <em>Backend-as-a-Service</em>, providing CRUD-accessible endpoints, a database, storage buckets, authentication, and even real-time communication. The upside of something like this is that you don&#39;t need to understand the complexities that come with backend development in order to build something that &#34;just works&#34;. However, you&#39;ll later come to see that this is also a hidden downside, as some people shouldn&#39;t be permitted within 10 feet of a backend.</p>
<p>Taking the place of a standard database, Supabase expects the client to talk directly to the database- now, you might be thinking to yourself: &#34;isn&#39;t that a horrible idea?&#34; and to your question, I&#39;ll reply &#34;yes.&#34; The assumption is that the person in charge of configuring Supabase will correctly dish out permissions such that end-users cannot simply read/write to arbitrary relations, but as you&#39;ll soon see, this is not always the case.</p>
<p>With the decompiled pseudocode in hand, it was as simple as grepping for a few keywords:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>function</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span><span> </span></span><span><span>{</span>

</span></code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the Supabase information, it&#39;s time to go hunting for relations that might be useful. After some investigation, it appears that all Supabase queries follow roughly the same pattern in the pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>r6</span> <span>=</span> <span>r4</span><span>.</span><span>supabase</span><span>;</span> <span>r4</span> <span>=</span> <span>r6</span><span>.</span><span>from</span><span>;</span>
<span>r13</span> <span>=</span> <span><span>&#39;</span>user_wallet<span>&#39;</span></span><span>;</span>
<span>...</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>With this in mind, we can write some cheeky Python that&#39;ll help us filter through this <em>checks notes</em> 1.5M LoC blob.</p>

<p>There are a few things here that are noteworthy, but let&#39;s investigate the <code>expo_push_token</code> field. It appears that any time a notification is to be sent out, it is issued by the client, with the following steps being taken:</p>
<ol>
<li>Client queries <code>profiles</code> relation for recipients&#39; Expo push token</li>
<li>Client issues POST request to Expo containing the notification content and the recipient&#39;s token</li>
<li>Recipient queries Expo for pending notifications</li>
<li>Recipient displays notification</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Under no circumstances should these Expo tokens be exposed to clients</strong>, however, the very architecture of this application relies on that being the case. With that in mind, I&#39;m quite sure that it&#39;s possible to issue arbitrary push notifications to any user. According to the official <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/push-notifications/sending-notifications/">Expo Docs</a> all we need to do is issue the following POST request:</p>
<pre><code><span><span><span>curl</span></span><span><span><span> -</span>H</span> <span><span>&#34;</span>Content-Type: application/json<span>&#34;</span></span><span><span> -</span>X</span> POST <span><span>&#34;</span>https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send<span>&#34;</span></span><span><span> -</span>d</span> <span><span>&#39;</span>{

<h2>Hall of Fame</h2>
<p>The main feature that sets Pandu apart from other social media platforms is its integration of games. Despite being poorly executed and far from original, there seems to be a group of people competing for spot #1 on the in-game leaderboard. I don&#39;t quite like Pandu, but I definitely am competitive by nature- let&#39;s see what we can do.</p>
<p>The rankings seem to be calculated client-side by simply querying the <code>user_progression</code> relation for the top 20 users sorted by total win count.</p>

<p>Presumably, all we should have to do is create a profile and propagate those aforementioned fields such that we satisfy the query. Additionally, we need to set the <code>user_id</code> field to satisfy the foreign key relationship between <code>user_progression</code> and <code>profiles</code>.</p>
<p>First, let&#39;s create the account:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>const</span> <span>auth</span> <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>supabase</span><span>.</span><span>auth</span><span>.</span><span><span>signUp</span><span><span>(</span>
    <span><span>{</span> 
        <span>email</span><span>:</span> <span><span>&#34;</span>john@fortnite.com<span>&#34;</span></span><span>,</span>
        <span>password</span><span>:</span> <span><span>&#34;</span>fuckyounerd<span>&#34;</span></span><span>,</span> 
    <span>}</span></span>
</span><span><span>)</span></span></span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span>userId</span> <span>=</span> <span>auth</span><span>.</span><span>data</span><span>.</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>;</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>And now we can propagate the fields of the relations:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>await</span> <span>supabase</span>
    <span>.</span><span><span>from</span><span><span>(</span><span><span>&#34;</span>user_progression<span>&#34;</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span></span>

<h2>Chats</h2>
<p>Moving on to something a bit more serious, the privacy implications of using software built by someone whose productive output is directly tied to the uptime of <a href="https://cursor.com">Cursor</a> is absolutely horrendous. Despite his apparent lack of competence, it appears that he has (miraculously) managed to implement user chat sessions in a pretty solid way. By piggybacking off of Supabase&#39;s authentication and <a href="https://getstream.io/chat/tour/">StreamChat&#39;s</a> real-time communication API, he has completely avoided doing any heavy lifting himself. Smart.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we should look for the tiny portion of this stack that he <em>is</em> responsible for creating. Before a chat session is initialized, a &#34;chat request&#34; is first sent out to a user, after which they can choose to either accept or reject the invitation. Checking the table of relations we mined earlier, the <code>chat_requests</code> relation seems like it might be relevant. Let&#39;s investigate.</p>

<p>Yup! Our suspicion is confirmed. <strong>Every single chat request is public!</strong> This is truly a nightmare. Even worse, I seemingly have read/write access to this table, meaning it&#39;s feasible to send chat requests with arbitrary messages on behalf of other users.</p>
<h2>User Location</h2>
<p>Okay, I think it&#39;s time we stop beating around the bush. I&#39;m sure if you&#39;ve been an attentive reader you will have noticed the <code>user_locations</code> relation from earlier. The in-app use case of this appears to be matching users up with others who are geographically close to them. While I understand the justification for a feature like this, the execution here is dangerously flawed. With a single <code>select</code> I am able to pull the live geographic location of any user on the app. You heard me right. This is <em>not</em> the future of social media, <strong>it&#39;s a sexual predator&#39;s wet dream</strong>.</p>

<p>If you need even more compelling evidence that this app is downright dangerous, take a quick look at this histogram of profile count by age:</p>
<p><img src="https://macwright.com/assets/pandu_age_distribution.png" alt="Pandu Profile Age Histogram"/></p>
<p>Nearly a thousand children under the age of 18 with their live location, photo, and age being beamed up to a database that&#39;s left wide open. Criminal.</p>

Christian is the &#34;mastermind&#34; behind this technological shitshow and its parent company, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/lunexis-technologies/">Lunexis</a>. As you&#39;ve already seen, this man needs no introduction.</p>
<p><img src="https://macwright.com/assets/pandu_eight.png" alt="Pandu had Eight Rejections"/></p>
<p>At first, I was wondering how he managed to even publish something like this, but I&#39;m starting to think that Apple just got tired of rejecting it over and over.</p>

<p>&#34;Vibe coding&#34; isn&#39;t just a cheap shortcut, it&#39;s <strong>reckless and dangerous</strong>. Christian&#39;s incompetence is jeopardizing the privacy of hundreds of people, all while he lines his pockets. What he is doing is <strong>illegal, perverse, and downright disgusting.</strong></p>
<p>Think I&#39;m exaggerating? I was planning on doing some math to estimate his MRR, but it looks like he&#39;s already gone ahead and bragged about it on <a href="https://x.com/chrismonfiston/">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://macwright.com/assets/christian_mrr.png" alt="Pandu MRR"/></p>
<p>Earlier in this write-up I managed to identify 146 active subscribers, assuming this figure is accurate and his revenue-per-subscription has stayed constant, that leaves us with an estimated MRR just north of $2,500. He is making serious money and has absolutely no clue what he&#39;s doing!</p>

<p>Calling this platform harmful is <strong>not an understatement</strong>. I am urging you to <strong>stop supporting this creator</strong>, <strong>report the app immediately</strong>, and <strong>get friends and loved ones off of this app as swiftly as possible</strong>.</p>
