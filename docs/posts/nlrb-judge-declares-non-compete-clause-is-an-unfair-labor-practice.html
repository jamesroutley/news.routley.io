Mory, Inc.</a></strong></em><span> yesterday. The case mostly revolves around an employer firing a union organizer that became employed at the company with the goal of organizing his coworkers (also known as “salting”). The union salt in this case lied about his employment history to get hired, declared he was a union organizer after being hired, and then was fired. Salting is protected activity, lying about your employment history to salt is also protected activity, and firing someone for salting is an unfair labor practice. Thus, Judge Karpinen ordered that the employer rehire the salt with backpay.</span></p><p><span>As part of litigating this case, the General Counsel (GC) of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) also alleged that the employer’s non-compete clause and coworker non-solicitation clause were illegal work rules under the </span><em><a href="https://nlrbresearch.com/pdfs/09031d4583af43bd.pdf" rel="">Stericycle</a></em><span> standard. The GC has been pursuing this </span><a href="https://nlrbresearch.com/pdfs/09031d4583a87168.pdf" rel="">particular legal theory</a><span> since early last year, but this is the first time the theory has been put in front of an ALJ and also the first time an ALJ has ruled that these kinds of clauses are unfair labor practices that violate the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).</span></p><p>The non-compete clause in question states that:</p><blockquote><p>(A) For a period of twelve (12) months following termination or separation of employment for any reason, Employee will not directly or indirectly, on Employee&#39;s behalf or on behalf of others:  … (iii) Engage in, be employed by, or become interested in, in any manner or capacity, as a principal, agent, partner, officer, director, employee, consultant, independent contractor, advisor or in any other capacity, with any insurance agency, insurance business or in any other business similar or competitive with Employer’s business as the same may exist at any time during the term of this Agreement, this covenant restricting Employee’s employment being limited to Employer’s service area which is defined as the county of the office where the Employee is located and to all contiguous counties thereto. If, during Employee’s employment, Employee is employed in any other of Employer’s locations, then these restrictions shall also apply to the county in which such office is located, and to all contiguous counties to that location. The parties expressly agree that the restrictions above set forth are fair and reasonable with regard to scope, time periods, geographic area and in all other respects.</p></blockquote><p>The ALJ determined that this clause was illegal with the following reasoning:</p><blockquote><p><span>The non-compete provision in Provision 2(A) is overly broad in scope and would deter a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity by barring employees from directly or indirectly, and in any capacity, engaging in, being employed by, or becoming interested in any enterprise that is “similar or competitive” to the employer’s business. Not only is this provision ridiculously broad in scope (could an employee indirectly engage with a competitor by sending a family member to buy something from its store?), but </span><strong>it would also cause a reasonable employee to refrain from engaging in protected activities that come with a risk of retaliation. If an employee knows they are barred from being involved in any capacity with any company that operates a similar business to Respondent, they will logically be more fearful of being fired and less willing to rock the boat because they face the prospect of being unable to find any work in their geographic area if they are fired or forced to leave their job.</strong></p></blockquote><p>The coworker non-solicitation clause in question states that:</p><blockquote><p>(C) During the term of this Agreement and for a period of 24 months after termination of employment for any reason, Employee will not, either directly or indirectly for himself or on behalf of others, solicit, encourage, or attempt to persuade any other employee of Employer to leave the employ of Employer. This is intended to prevent “pirating” of Employer employees.</p></blockquote><p>The ALJ determined that this clause was illegal with the following reasoning:</p><blockquote><p><span>The prohibition in Provision 1(C) on soliciting employees to leave Respondent’s employ would </span><strong>dissuade a reasonable employee from engaging in protected activity like telling their coworkers about the wages and benefits offered by the Union out of a reasonable fear that Respondent might accuse them of inducing other employees to quit</strong><span>. See </span><strong><a href="https://nlrbresearch.com/pdfs/09031d45800b7ca9.pdf" rel="">M.J. Mechanical Services, 325 NLRB 1098, 1106 (1998)</a></strong><span> (telling employees about union benefits, encouraging them to engage in salting activities, and referring them to union hall protected even when it resulted in one employee going to work for a union contractor). </span><strong>It may also deter employees from asking their coworkers to make a concerted threat to quit unless their working conditions improve.</strong><span> See </span><strong><a href="https://nlrbresearch.com/pdfs/09031d4583883f78.pdf" rel="">Morgan Corp., 371 NLRB No. 142, slip op. at 5 (2022)</a></strong><span> (employee who told supervisor that he and his co-workers would quit over demand for higher wages was “indisputably” engaged in protected concerted activity).</span></p></blockquote><p>Despite all the discussion about the FTC banning non-competes, there still seems to be little recognition that non-competes for non-supervisory workers are effectively impossible to enforce at the moment due to the policies of the NLRB GC.</p></div></div></div></article></div></div></div>
