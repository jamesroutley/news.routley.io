    <h1>Everyone has a Substack and itâ€™s great</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>As Iâ€™ve been <a href="https://www.bryanbraun.com/2023/11/28/doubling-down-on-rss/">doubling-down on RSS</a>, one thing Iâ€™ve noticed is how many of my RSS feeds now come from <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>.</p>
<p>I like that Substack is getting more people blogging. Blogging lets you sit down with a topic and refine your thinking around it. We need more of that.</p>
<p>I like the business model of Substack. Direct pay seems to create better incentives than an advertising-based business model. Subscriptions are focused and topical. Quality is high. I feel like paying customers can only stomach so much clickbait before they stop sending you money.</p>
<p>Substackâ€™s business model encourages authors to write freemium-style. The free content attracts new readers and the premium content supports the author (funded by their biggest fans). Freemium has flaws but it creates a lot of positive consumer surplus.</p>
<p>For example, every Substack comes with an RSS feed. All free content is available in the feed and all premium content is teased in the feed as well (usually with a title a preview snippet). Apparently there are also <a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041722272-Will-my-Podcast-RSS-feed-show-paid-only-content-">unique feed urls containing free and premium content for paid subscribers</a> (though I havenâ€™t tested this myself).</p>
<p>Facebook used to have RSS feeds but it ended up removing them because RSS undermined their ad-based business model. With Substack, RSS <em>helps</em> the business model instead of hurting it.</p>
<p>I do have a few concerns about Substackâ€™s popularity. Journalistic integrity is less enforced than traditional media. Media fragmentation can result in filter-bubbles which seems kind of harmful.</p>
<p>And of course, Substack is still floating on venture capital so itâ€™s hard to tell how things will change when they are forced to become profitable. Remember Medium? They got a lot of praise for bringing blogging to the masses and disrupting ad-based publishingâ€¦ until they ran out of money and needed to set up site-wide paywalls. ðŸ«¤</p>
<p>But overall, I feel pretty happy about the current state of things. Everyone has a Substack and itâ€™s great.</p>
