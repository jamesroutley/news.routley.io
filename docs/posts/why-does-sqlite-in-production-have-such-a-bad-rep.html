    <h1>Why does SQLite (in production) have such a bad rep?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>Why?</p><ul><li><p>Most people see it from a web workload perspective. Typically, we use Client-Server databases like PostgreSQL. But, SQLite absolutely shines in many other cases like mobile or embedded devices.</p></li><li><p>For a long time, SQLite did not allow concurrent writes along with readers. This was changed in the WAL mode, where you could have a writer with multiple readers.</p></li><li><p>You still cannot have multiple concurrent writers. That immediately puts off people. Your workload might or might not need this.</p></li><li><p>SQLite did not have a good backup and replication story. This was a major issue, but <a href="https://x.com/benbjohnson">Ben Johnson</a> changed the entire scene with <a href="https://litestream.io/">Litestream</a>. I would say this was one of the most impactful contributions to SQLite ecosystem.</p></li><li><p>Some ORMs / libraries come with terrible defaults. For example, not setting <code>PRAGMA busy_timeout</code>.</p></li><li><p>Funny little story: I started learning programming with Django, and the docs straight up said SQLite isnâ€™t suitable for production. I had a wrong impression for a long time. Then I started using it for my own use cases and realized the trade-offs.</p></li></ul><p>SQLite, like any other database, has its pros and cons. For the majority of applications and scales, it is perfect. You always have PostgreSQL for anything else.</p><p>TLDR: SQLite slaps. You will be fine.</p><hr/><p><small>The original question, the title, asked by <a href="https://x.com/jasonleowsg/status/1803030457166270806">Jason Leow</a> and my <a href="https://x.com/iavins/status/1803429828768764016">xeet</a>.</small><br/></p></article></div></div>
