<p>A year ago as a result of China’s crackdown on cryptocurrency mining facilities, Bitcoin (<a href="https://finbold.com/topic/bitcoin/">BTC</a>) mining became <a href="https://finbold.com/chinas-crypto-crackdown-results-in-easier-and-more-profitable-bitcoin-mining/">easier and more profitable</a>. More than half of the hashrate, or the processing power of the Bitcoin network, dropped since the market peak in May 2021 as a result of the <a href="https://finbold.com/nvidia-asus-gpus-prices-in-china-plummet-amid-crypto-mining-restrictions/">Chinese government’s mining restriction</a>. </p>
<p>In spite of this, mining Bitcoin is no longer profitable for miners, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoRank_io/status/1537746361503866881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data</a> from the cryptocurrency analytics platform <em>CryptoRank</em> that was published on June 17. </p>
<p>This is because of the meltdown that has occurred in the <a href="https://finbold.com/category/cryptocurrency-news/">cryptocurrency market</a>, which has caused Bitcoin’s price to drop to a level that has not been seen in the past 18 months and has led the flagship digital asset to struggle to maintain support above the critical $20,000 level. </p>
<p>Given that Bitcoin’s price has dropped to the average cost of mining the platform stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Due to a significant drop in BTC price over the past months, mining has become less profitable. For some Bitcoin miners, it might even be unprofitable at the moment.”</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="h-bitcoin-mining-stocks-see-slowing-growth">Bitcoin mining stocks see slowing growth</h2>


<p>It’s worth mentioning that Finbold reported earlier this week that cryptocurrency and Bitcoin mining-related stocks saw slowing growth in May with Marathon Digital Holding (NASDAQ: MARA) and Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT) leading the way.</p>
<p>While the debate among lawmakers in different countries, states and cities rages on about the environmental effects of Bitcoin Proof-of-Work (<a href="https://finbold.com/guide/cryptocurrency-staking-guide/#ProofofStake_vs_ProofofWork">PoW</a>) mining. On June 16 a group of United States Congress members <a href="https://finbold.com/14-u-s-congress-members-appeal-to-epa-citing-environmental-and-financial-benefits-of-bitcoin-mining/">sent a letter</a> to the country’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), explaining the practice actually has certain benefits.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the PoW cryptocurrencies have been subjected to widespread criticism owing to the huge amount of electricity required to mine them, in contrast to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) assets, which are seen as being friendlier to the environment. </p>
<p>As a result of the dispute, authorities in certain areas have even <a href="https://finbold.com/eu-regulator-proposes-ban-on-proof-of-work-crypto-mining-urges-focus-on-staking/">recommended outright prohibiting</a> the use of the PoW method. Recent events saw a prohibition of a similar kind being <a href="https://finbold.com/new-york-senate-passes-bitcoin-mining-ban-bill-over-environmental-concerns/">approved by the Senate of the State of New York</a>, but the Parliament of the <a href="https://finbold.com/breaking-eu-parliament-votes-against-ban-on-proof-of-work-mechanism-underlying-cryptos-like-bitcoin/">European Union voted against it</a>.</p>
