    <h1>Custom SQL functions for data analytics in PostgreSQL</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><strong>SQL is the lingua franca for analytics. </strong>As data proliferates, we need to find new ways to store, explore, and analyze it. <a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/blog/why-sql-beating-nosql-what-this-means-for-future-of-data-time-series-database-348b777b847a/">We believe SQL is the best language for data analysis</a>. We’ve championed the benefits of SQL for several years, even when many were swapping it for custom domain-specific languages. Full SQL support was one of the <a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/when-boring-is-awesome-building-a-scalable-time-series-database-on-postgresql-2900ea453ee2/">key reasons</a> we chose to build TimescaleDB on top of PostgreSQL, the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-database-prof">most loved database among developers</a>, rather than creating a custom query language. And we were right—SQL is making a comeback (although it never really went away) and has become the universal language for data analysis, with many NoSQL databases adding SQL interfaces to keep up.</p><p>In addition, most developers are familiar with SQL, along with most data scientists, data analysts, and other professionals who work with data. Whether you&#39;ve taken classes at university, done an online course, or attended a boot camp, chances are that you probably have learned a bit of SQL along the way. So you and your fellow developers already know it, making it easier for teams to onboard new members and quickly extract value from the data. With a proprietary language, learning the language is in itself a barrier to using the data—you’ll have to ask another team to write the queries or rely on a separate data lake.</p><p><a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/blog/what-the-heck-is-time-series-data-and-why-do-i-need-a-time-series-database-dcf3b1b18563/"><strong>Time-series data</strong></a><strong> is ubiquitous. </strong>At Timescale, our mission is to serve developers worldwide and enable them to build exceptional data-driven products that measure everything that matters: software applications, industrial equipment, financial markets, blockchain activity, user actions, consumer behavior, machine learning models, climate change, and more.</p><p>And time-series data comes at you fast, sometimes generating millions of data points per second. Because of the sheer volume and rate of information, time-series data can be complex to query and analyze, even in SQL.</p><p><strong>TimescaleDB hyperfunctions make it easier to manipulate and analyze time-series datasets with fewer lines of SQL code</strong>. Hyperfunctions are purpose-built for the most common and difficult time-series and analytical queries developers write today in SQL. Using hyperfunctions makes you more productive when querying time-series data, which means you can spend less time creating reports, dashboards, and visualizations involving time-series, and spend more time acting on the insights that your work unearths!</p><h2 id="meet-hyperfunctions">Meet Hyperfunctions</h2><p>There are over 70 different TimescaleDB hyperfunctions ready to use today.

This contrasts with other efforts to improve the developer experience by introducing new SQL syntax. While introducing new syntax with new keywords and constructs may have been easier from an implementation perspective, we made the deliberate decision not to do so since we believe it leads to a worse experience for the end-user. </p><p>New SQL syntax means existing drivers, libraries, and tools may no longer work. That can leave developers with more problems than solutions as their favorite tools, libraries, or drivers may not support the new syntax or require time-consuming modifications. On the other hand, new SQL functions mean that your query will run in every visualization tool, database admin tool, or data analysis tool. </p><p>We have the freedom to create custom functions, aggregates, and procedures that help developers better understand and work with their data, and ensure all their drivers and interfaces still work as expected!</p><p>TimescaleDB hyperfunctions come pre-loaded and ready to use on every hosted and managed database service in Timescale Cloud, the easiest way to get started with TimescaleDB.<a href="https://www.timescale.com/timescale-signup"> Get started with a free Timescale Cloud trial</a>—no credit card required.

We love to work with our users to simplify SQL!</p><h2 id="solved-how-to-query-arbitrary-time-intervals-with-datetrunc">Solved: How to Query Arbitrary Time-Intervals With date_trunc</h2><p>When using PostgreSQL, the <code><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html">date_trunc</a></code><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-datetime.html"> function</a> can be useful when you want to aggregate information over an interval of time. <code>date_trunc</code> truncates a <code>TIMESTAMP</code> or an <code>INTERVAL</code> value based on a specified date part (e.g., hour, week, or month) and returns the truncated timestamp or interval. For example, <code>date_trunc</code> can aggregate by one second, one hour, one day, or one week. However, you often want to see aggregates by the time intervals that matter most to your use case, which may be intervals like 30 seconds, 5 minutes, 12 hours, etc. This can get pretty complicated in SQL, just look at the query below which analyzes taxi ride activity in five-minute time intervals:</p><p><strong>Regular PostgreSQL: Taxi rides taken every five minutes</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>SELECT
  EXTRACT(hour from pickup_datetime) as hours,
  trunc(EXTRACT(minute from pickup_datetime) / 5)*5 AS five_mins,
  COUNT(*)
FROM rides
WHERE pickup_datetime &lt; &#39;2016-01-02 00:00&#39;
GROUP BY hours, five_mins;
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>The </strong><code><strong>time_bucket()</strong></code><strong> hyperfunction makes it easy to query your data in whatever time interval is most relevant to your analysis use case</strong>. <code>time_bucket()</code> enables you to aggregate data by arbitrary time intervals (e.g., 10 seconds, 5 minutes, 6 hours, etc.), and gives you flexible groupings and offsets, instead of just second, minute, hour, and so on.</p><p>In addition to allowing more flexible time-series queries, <code>time_bucket()</code> also allows you to write these queries in a simpler way. Just look much simpler the query from the example above is to write and understand when using the <code>time_bucket()</code> hyperfunction:</p><p><strong>TimescaleDB hyperfunctions: Taxi rides taken every five minutes</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>-- How many rides took place every 5 minutes for the first day of 2016?
SELECT time_bucket(&#39;5 minute&#39;, pickup_datetime) AS five_min, count(*)
FROM rides
WHERE pickup_datetime &lt; &#39;2016-01-02 00:00&#39;
GROUP BY five_min
ORDER BY five_min;
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>If you’d like even more flexibility when aggregating your data, you can test out the experimental hyperfunction <code><a href="https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/time_bucket_ng/">time_bucket_ng(</a>)</code>, which is an updated version of the original <code>time_bucket()</code> hyperfunction. <code>time_bucket_ng()</code> enables you to bucket your data by years and months, in addition to second, minute, and hour time intervals. This allows you to easily do monthly cohort analysis or other multiple month-based reports in SQL.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>SELECT timescaledb_experimental.time_bucket_ng(&#39;3 month&#39;, date &#39;2021-08-01&#39;);
 time_bucket_ng
----------------
 2021-07-01
(1 row)
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><code>time_bucket_ng()</code> also features custom timezone support, which enables you to write queries like the one below, which illustrates using it to bucket data in the Europe/Moscow region:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>-- note that timestamptz is displayed differently depending on the session parameters
SET TIME ZONE &#39;Europe/Moscow&#39;;

SELECT timescaledb_experimental.time_bucket_ng(&#39;1 month&#39;, timestamptz &#39;2001-02-03 12:34:56 MSK&#39;, timezone =&gt; &#39;Europe/Moscow&#39;);
     time_bucket_ng
------------------------
 2001-02-01 00:00:00+03
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Missing data or gaps is a common occurrence when capturing hundreds or thousands of time-series readings per second or minute. This can happen due to irregular sampling intervals, or you have experienced an outage of some sort. </p><p>The <code>time_bucket_gapfill()</code> hyperfunction enables you to create additional rows of data in any gaps, ensuring that the returned rows are in chronological order and contiguous. To learn more about gappy data, read our blog <a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/sql-functions-for-time-series-analysis/">Mind the Gap: Using SQL Functions for Time-Series Analysis</a>.</p><p>Here’s an example of <code>time_bucket_gapfill()</code> in action, where we find the daily average temperature for a certain device and use the <code>locf()</code> function to carry the last observation forward in the case we have gaps in our data:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>SELECT
  time_bucket_gapfill(&#39;1 day&#39;, time, now() - INTERVAL &#39;1 week&#39;, now()) AS day,
  device_id,
  avg(temperature) AS value,
  locf(avg(temperature))
FROM metrics
WHERE time &gt; now () - INTERVAL &#39;1 week&#39;
GROUP BY day, device_id
ORDER BY day;

(In this post, you can learn more about the <a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/how-percentile-approximation-works-and-why-its-more-useful-than-averages/">design decisions and trade-offs made in TimescaleDB’s percentile approximation hyperfunctions design</a>.)</p><p>TimescaleDB has a whole family of <a href="https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/percentile-approximation/">percentile approximation hyperfunctions</a>. The simplest way to call them is to use the <a href="https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/percentile-approximation/percentile_agg/">percentile_agg aggregate</a> along with the<a href="https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/percentile-approximation/approx_percentile/"> approx_percentile accessor</a>. For example, here’s how we might calculate the 10th, 50th (mean), and 90th percentiles of the response time of a particular API:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>SELECT 
    approx_percentile(0.1, percentile_agg(response_time)) as p10, 
    approx_percentile(0.5, percentile_agg(response_time)) as p50, 
    approx_percentile(0.9, percentile_agg(response_time)) as p90 
FROM responses;
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Hyperfunctions for percentile approximation can also be used in <a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/how-we-made-data-aggregation-better-and-faster-on-postgresql-with-timescaledb-2-7/">TimescaleDB´s continuous aggregates</a> which make aggregate queries on very large datasets run faster. Continuous aggregates continuously and incrementally store the results of an aggregation query in the background. So, when you run the query, only the changed data needs to be computed, not the entire dataset.</p><p>That is a huge advantage compared to exact percentiles because you can now do things like baselining and alerting on longer periods without recalculating from scratch every time!</p><p>For example, here’s how you can use continuous aggregates to identify recent outliers and investigate potential problems. First, we create a one-hour aggregation from the hypertable <code>responses</code>:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>CREATE TABLE responses(
	ts timestamptz, 
	response_time DOUBLE PRECISION);
SELECT create_hypertable(&#39;responses&#39;, &#39;ts&#39;);

    percentile_agg(response_time)
FROM responses
GROUP BY time_bucket(&#39;1 hour&#39;::interval, ts);
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>To find outliers, we can find the data in the last 30 seconds greater than the 99th percentile:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>SELECT * FROM responses 
WHERE ts &gt;= now()-&#39;30s&#39;::interval

That often occurs in IoT scenarios, where you want to monitor devices in different locations, but each device sends back data at different times (as devices can go offline, experience connectivity issues,  batch transmit data, or simply have different sampling rates).</p><p>The <code>last</code> hyperfunction allows you to get the value of one column as ordered by another. For example, <code>last(temperature, time)</code> returns the latest temperature value based on time within an aggregate group. </p><p>This way, you can write queries more easily which, for example, will find the last recorded temperature at multiple locations, as each location might have different rates of data being sampled and recorded:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>SELECT location, last(temperature, time)

Approximate count distincts do not calculate the exact cardinality of a dataset, but rather estimate the number of unique values, in order to improve compute time. We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog">HyperLogLog</a>, a probabilistic cardinality estimator that uses significantly less memory than the equivalent <code>COUNT DISTINCT</code> query.  </p><p><code><a href="https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/approx_count_distincts/hyperloglog/">Hyperloglog(</a>)</code> is an approximation object for <code>COUNT DISTINCT</code> queries. And the <code><a href="https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/approx_count_distincts/distinct_count/">distinct_count(</a>)</code> accessor function gets the number of distinct values from a HyperLogLog object, as illustrated in the example below, which efficiently estimates the number of unique NFTs and collections in a hypothetical NFT marketplace:<br/></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>SELECT
  distinct_count(hyperloglog(32768, asset_id)) AS nft_count,

FROM nft_sales
WHERE payment_symbol = &#39;ETH&#39; AND time &gt; NOW()-INTERVAL &#39;3 months&#39;

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>You can also use the <code><a href="https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/hyperfunctions/approx_count_distincts/stderror/">std_error(</a>)</code> function to estimate the relative standard error of the HyperLogLog compared to running <code>COUNT DISTINCT</code> directly. </p><h2 id="enhanced-query-readability-and-maintenance-with-function-pipelines">Enhanced Query Readability and Maintenance With Function Pipelines </h2><div><p>🚀</p><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> In the spirit of </em><a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/blog/move-fast-but-dont-break-things-introducing-the-experimental-schema-with-new-experimental-features-in-timescaledb-2-4/"><em>moving fast and not breaking things</em></a><em>, the hyperfunctions in this section are released as experimental—please play around with them but don’t use them in production.</em></p></div><p>At Timescale, we’re huge fans of SQL. But as we’ve seen in many examples above, SQL can get quite unwieldy for certain kinds of analytical and time-series queries. Enter TimescaleDB Function Pipelines.</p><p><strong>TimescaleDB Function Pipelines</strong> radically improve the developer ergonomics of analyzing data in PostgreSQL and SQL, by applying principles from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> and popular tools like <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html">Python’s Pandas</a> and <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/">PromQL</a>. In short, they improve your coding productivity, making your SQL code easier for others to comprehend and maintain.</p><p>Inspired by functional programming languages, Function Pipelines enable you to analyze data by composing multiple functions, leading to a simpler, cleaner way of expressing complex logic in PostgreSQL.</p><p>And the best part: we built Function Pipelines in a fully PostgreSQL-compliant way! We did not change any SQL syntax, meaning that any tool that speaks PostgreSQL will be able to support data analysis using function pipelines.</p><p>To understand the power of TimescaleDB Function Pipelines, consider the following PostgreSQL query.</p><p><strong><strong>Regular PostgreSQL query:</strong></strong><br/></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>SELECT device_id, 
	sum(abs_delta) as volatility
FROM (
	SELECT device_id, 
		abs(val - lag(val) OVER (PARTITION BY device_id ORDER BY ts))
        	as abs_delta 
	FROM measurements
	WHERE ts &gt;= now() - &#39;1 day&#39;::interval) calc_delta
GROUP BY device_id;
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>And a much more readable query using TimescaleDB Function Pipelines:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>SELECT device_id, 
	timevector(ts, val) -&gt; sort() -&gt; delta() -&gt; abs() -&gt; sum() 
    		as volatility
FROM measurements
WHERE ts &gt;= now() - &#39;1 day&#39;::interval
GROUP BY device_id;
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>It is now much clearer what this query is doing, performing the following sets of tasks:</p><ul><li>Getting the last day’s data from the measurements table, grouped by <code>device_id</code></li><li>Sorting the data by the time column</li><li>Calculating the delta (or change) between values</li><li>Taking the absolute value of the delta</li><li>And then taking the sum of the result of the previous steps</li></ul><p>To learn more about using TimescaleDB Function Pipelines, read the <a href="https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/hyperfunctions/function-pipelines/">docs </a>and see our explainer blog post: <a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/function-pipelines-building-functional-programming-into-postgresql-using-custom-operators/">Function Pipelines: Building Functional Programming Into PostgreSQL Using Custom Operators</a>.</p><h2 id="easier-frequency-analysis-with-frequency-aggregates">Easier Frequency Analysis With Frequency Aggregates</h2><div><p>🚀</p><p><em><strong>Note</strong>: In the spirit of </em><a href="https://www.timescale.com/blog/blog/move-fast-but-dont-break-things-introducing-the-experimental-schema-with-new-experimental-features-in-timescaledb-2-4/"><em>moving fast and not breaking things</em></a><em>, the hyperfunctions in this section are released as experimental—please play around with them but don’t use them in production.</em></p></div><p>When working with large datasets, frequency analysis is often computationally expensive, as it requires computing over the entire dataset to get an accurate result. Instead of counting all elements of a dataset, you might prefer to<em> estimate</em> the frequency of the most common elements of a set.</p><p>The <strong>frequency aggregate hyperfunction</strong> or <code>freq_agg()</code> enables you to track the approximate frequency within a column of all values with a minimum frequency. </p><p>This example creates a frequency aggregate over a field <code>ZIP</code> (representing ZIP codes) in a HomeSales table. This aggregate tracks any <code>ZIP</code> value occurring in at least 5 % of rows, allowing you to keep track of common ZIP codes efficiently:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>CREATE toolkit_experimental.freq_agg(0.05, ZIP) FROM HomeSales;
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>You can also use the frequency aggregate hyperfunction to estimate the maximum and minimum frequency of a particular value in your dataset. For example, we can find the most frequent rounded square roots of integers 1-100 using the frequency aggregate hyperfunction as follows:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>SELECT value, min_freq, max_freq 
FROM toolkit_experimental.into_values(
    (SELECT toolkit_experimental.freq_agg(0.15, ceiling(sqrt(v))::int) 
     FROM generate_series(1,100) v), 
    0::int
);

value | min_freq | max_freq 
-------+----------+----------
    10 |     0.19 |     0.24
     9 |     0.17 |      0.2
     8 |     0.15 |     0.16
     7 |     0.13 |     0.13
     6 |     0.11 |     0.11
     5 |     0.09 |     0.09
     4 |     0.07 |     0.07
</code></pre>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> <code>Freq_agg</code> is implemented under the hood using the Space-Saving algorithm by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-metwally/">Metwally</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyakant-agrawal-272632/">Agrawal</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amr-el-abbadi-0325b4/">El Abbadi</a> in their paper <a href="https://cs.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/documents/2005-23.pdf">Efficient Computation of Frequent and Top-k Elements in Data Streams</a>.</p><p>Moreover, we often want to know the top N values of a dataset. To do this, we can use the <strong><code>topn_agg</code> hyperfunction, </strong>which estimates the top values present in a column.</p><p>Here’s an example of using <code>topn_agg</code> to find the top five most common rounded square roots from 100,000 random numbers in the range (1,1000):</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code>SELECT toolkit_experimental.topn(
