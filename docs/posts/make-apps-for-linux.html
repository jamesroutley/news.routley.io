					<p>Desktop and mobile Linux users have a healthy appetite for new software. Linux app stores and repositories lack applications compared to their proprietary counterparts.</p>
<p>Technical enthusiasts are encouraged to direct their passion and creativity towards creating fresh apps for Linux users.</p>
<p>Too often they fall into the trap of creating more Linux distributions. We don’t need more Linux distributions. Stop making Linux distributions, make applications instead.</p>

          <h2>Why create more applications</h2>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>Scratch an Itch</h4>
          <p>Ever had an idea for an application you personally need? You may find others have a similar desire for your application idea. Scratch that itch.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>Broaden the ecosystem</h4>
          <p>New applications can inspire new developers on Linux. Building applications in the open allows developers even newer than yourself to learn and get started. Help build the next Linux app generation.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>Be creative</h4>
          <p>Developing applications is a naturally creative endeavour. The sense of fulfilment gained when completing a project can be very rewarding. Exercise that half of your brain.</p>
        </div>

      </p>
      <div>
          
        <div>
          <h4>Collaborate</h4>
          <p>Building applications fosters communities. Linux communities often want to help developers succeed. Make something people want, and build a group of fans and contributors around it.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>Learn new skills</h4>
          <p>Developing applications is a sought-after skill. There are many free training resources to help you learn to develop software. Level up your résumé!</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h4>Earn a wage</h4>
          <p>Build popular paid applications and services. It’s a myth that Linux users don’t support developers financially. Use this as an opportunity to create a new source of income for yourself.</p>

          <h2>Target all the Linux distributions</h2>
          <p>Unlike other platforms, Linux is a very diverse target. There are hundreds of Linux distributions, some more popular than others. Once published though, applications can generally work everywhere.</p>
<p>There are well documented software packaging and distribution systems which enable developers to get their applications into the hands of users.</p>
<p>Each developer framework and Linux distribution will have their own recommended route to users. When you’re ready to share your creation, the development documentation will signpost their suggested packaging guides.</p>

          <p>We need to ensure a thriving app ecosystem to bring Linux to the masses. Our dream of an open desktop, accessible to all can only be achieved by enabling everyone to develop for Linux.</p>

          <p>There’s a unique opportunity with desktop Linux to not only build great apps, but to help shape platform APIs and influence the overall direction of the desktop you’re publishing on.</p>

          <p>Working on Linux apps is a completely different experience from developing for a closed ecosystem. Though we’re technically competitors, in the end, we’re all collaborating on the same bigger vision.</p>
