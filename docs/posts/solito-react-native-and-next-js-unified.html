    <h1>Solito – React Native and Next.js unified</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header></header><p><img src="https://solito.dev/img/og.svg"/></p><p>Solito is the missing piece for using React Native with Next.js to build powerful cross-platform apps.</p><h2 id="about">About<a href="#about" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This library is two things:</p><ol><li>A tiny wrapper around React Navigation and Next.js that lets you share navigation code across plaforms.</li><li>A set of patterns and examples for building cross-platform apps with React Native + Next.js.</li></ol><h2 id="motivation">Motivation<a href="#motivation" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>In 2021, I spoke at Next.js Conf about how I built <a href="https://beatgig.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beatgig.com</a> with Next.js and React Native.</p><p>Since then, a sizable community has grown around this stack. The goal of this project is to bring together the hardest piece of cross-platform development: navigation.</p><p>If you haven&#39;t seen it yet, I recommend you watch the talk:</p><p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lnbdRweJtA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></p><h2 id="background">Background<a href="#background" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Prior to Solito, I built <a href="https://moti.fyi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moti</a> for cross-platform animations, powered by Reanimated 2. I also made <a href="https://dripsy.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dripsy</a>, a library for building theme-based, responsive design for React Native and Web.</p><p>Little by little, I released a <a href="https://github.com/nandorojo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">number of libraries</a> dedicated to Next.js + React Native.</p><p>My first library, <a href="https://github.com/nandorojo/expo-next-react-navigation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>expo-next-react-navigation</code></a>, was the first iteration of Solito, which I used for a few years. Eventually, I realized that the API was too convoluted to work as a replacement for <code>next/router</code>. Then React Navigation released a great API for navigating around with URLs, and I realized that that would be the future.</p><p>I opened an issue on <code>expo-next-react-navigation</code> called <a href="https://github.com/nandorojo/expo-next-react-navigation/issues/68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#34;The Future API&#34;</a> where I thought through all the necessary steps to truly unify the stack.</p><p>Next, <a href="https://github.com/axeldelafosse/expo-next-monorepo-example/pull/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I worked on a PR</a> with Axel Delafosse, hoping to share navigation code between Expo + Next.js. That PR has nearly 100 comments from people in the community chiming in on my ideas. Ultimately, I dropped the approach I built in that PR in favor of a simpler, headless navigation method. And there, Solito was born.</p><h3 id="the-rabbit-hole">The rabbit hole<a href="#the-rabbit-hole" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>If you are curious about my journey working on Expo + Next.js, and how I arrived here, I recommend doing a few things:</p><ol><li><p>Watch my <a href="#motivation">Next.js Conf talk</a>.</p></li><li><p>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/fernandotherojo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and read through my tweets.</p></li><li><p>Read through issues &amp; PRs created by me on my GitHub repos – mainly on <a href="https://github.com/nandorojo/moti" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moti</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nandorojo/dripsy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dripsy</a>.</p><p>a. For example, in <a href="https://github.com/nandorojo/dripsy/issues/46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this issue</a> on the Dripsy repo, I explained my desire for a high-performance, simple animation library. That idea became Moti, which is now one of the most popular libraries for animating in React Native (+ Web).</p><p>b. I spent a lot of time trying to add SSR support to Dripsy to Next.js, and ultimately <a href="https://github.com/nandorojo/dripsy/issues/100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped it</a> due to limitations from React Native. If you do some Googling about React Native Web&#39;s Server Side Rendering support, you&#39;ll find me talking about it.</p><p>c. <a href="https://github.com/axeldelafosse/expo-next-monorepo-example/pull/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This PR</a> I mentioned earlier is good to read through too (not the code, just the comments.)</p></li><li><p>Listen to this <a href="https://reactnativeradio.com/episodes/rnr-224-react-native-web-on-nextjs-with-fernando-rojo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">episode</a> of React Native Radio, where we discuss Expo + Next.js.</p></li><li><p>Read the Solito <a href="https://solito.dev/gradual-adoption">Gradual Adoption</a> and <a href="https://solito.dev/methodology">Methodology</a> sections.</p></li><li><p>Read the introduction of the <a href="https://moti.fyi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moti docs</a>, where I shared my thoughts on the state of React Native.</p></li></ol><p>Special thanks to <a href="https://axeldelafosse.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axel</a> for sharing my love for this stack and for coming up with the idea of an Expo + Next.js &#34;metaframework&#34;.</p></div></div>
