They were invisible.”</p><h2>Snotty barrier</h2><p>Mucins are large proteins decorated with carbohydrates that form linkages with one another, creating a water-laden, gel-like substance.

Shi and her colleagues looked at what happens to the glycocalyx in the brain as mice age. “The mucins on the young blood vessels were thick and juicy and plump,” says Bertozzi. “In the old mice, they were thin and lame and patchy.”</p><p>The team went on to find that mucins in a particular class were less abundant in old mice than in young mice. The scientists also showed that a decrease in the activity of enzymes needed to produce these mucins caused <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06707-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06707-4" data-track-category="body text link">the blood–brain barrier</a> to become leakier.</p><p>And bolstering the activity of those enzymes in old mice reduced the leakage and improved the animals’ performance on learning and memory tests. Old mice can be forgetful, says Bertozzi. “They can’t get out of the maze like they used to. But they do better on those tests after we restore the mucin barrier.”</p></div></div>
