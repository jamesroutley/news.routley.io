    <h1>Mapping hospital accessibility with OpenStreetMap</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="rural-hospital-accessibility">Rural Hospital Accessibility</h2>
<!-- --><p>Rural Americans face many challenges accessing medical care.
Hospitals and other medical facilities tend to cluster in denser population areas,
leaving residents of rural areas without nearby access to medical care, especially
for specialty medicine.</p>
<!-- --><p>According to the Department of Health and Human Services,
65.83% of designated Health Professional Shortage Areas are rural. <!-- --><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-rural-shortages" id="user-content-fnref-rural-shortages" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> <!-- --><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-rural-health-info" id="user-content-fnref-rural-health-info" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup></p>
<!-- --><p>Increased distance to a hospital during a medical emergency also increases mortality rates.
A 2007 study found on average, a 10km increase in distance to the hospital
during an emergency resulted in a 1% increase in mortality. <!-- --><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-hospital-study" id="user-content-fnref-hospital-study" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
<!-- --><p>Due to these factors, residents without access to nearby hospitals may face worse medical outcomes.</p>
<!-- --><h3 id="driving-distance-hospital-accessibility">Driving Distance Hospital Accessibility</h3>
<!-- --><p>For this project, I wanted to see how much of my state, Virginia, was within a given driving time
of a hospital.
Specifically, how much is within 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and 40 minutes of a hospital?</p>
<!-- --><p>If you&#39;re dying to know the answer, the interactive map answering this question can be found
<!-- --><a href="https://wcedmisten.fyi/project/virginia-hospital-distance/">here</a>.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><h2 id="openstreetmap">OpenStreetMap</h2>
<!-- --><p>OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a crowd-sourced map dataset spanning the entire world.
For this project, I used the data in two ways:</p>
<!-- --><ol>
<!-- --><li>finding a list of hospitals and their locations</li>
<!-- --><li>finding the Isochrone map<!-- --><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-isochrones" id="user-content-fnref-isochrones" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup> for each hospital<!-- --></li>
<!-- --></ol>
<!-- --><p>I used the OSM extract provided by GeoFabrik for the state of Virginia.</p>
<!-- --><h3 id="finding-all-hospitals-in-virginia">Finding all hospitals in Virginia</h3>
<!-- --><p>To find all hospitals in OpenStreetMap, I searched for the tag
<!-- --><code>amenity=hospital</code>. This tag differs from <!-- --><code>amenity=clinic</code> subtly.
The difference between a clinic and a hospital is not always obvious.
However, the main distinction is that a hospital offers inpatient
care, while a clinic does not.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>To search the dataset, I first considered using the Overpass API <!-- --><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-overpass-api" id="user-content-fnref-overpass-api" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup>,
but I hit two problems:<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><ol>
<!-- --><li>the size of my query was too big to use the free public instance (Overpass Turbo)</li>
<!-- --><li>setting up the software to run locally seemed too complicated compared to just using PostGIS</li>
<!-- --></ol>
<!-- --><p>So ultimately I decided to just use PostGIS, which was more familiar to me.</p>
<!-- --><p>I used <!-- --><code>osm2pgsql</code> to import the data, and then could easily query it using SQL.
To get all hospitals names and locations, only two simple queries were required:<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>To get all hospitals that were tagged as points:</p>
<!-- --><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> ST_AsText(ST_Transform(way,<!-- --><span>4326</span>)) <!-- --><span>as</span> centroid,osm_id,name
<!-- --><span>FROM</span> planet_osm_point
<!-- --><span>WHERE</span> amenity<!-- --><span>=</span><span>&#39;hospital&#39;</span>;
<!-- --></code></pre>
<!-- --><p>And to get all hospitals that were tagged as polygons:</p>
<!-- --><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> ST_AsText(ST_Transform(ST_Centroid(way),<!-- --><span>4326</span>)) <!-- --><span>AS</span> centroid, osm_id, name
<!-- --><span>FROM</span> planet_osm_polygon
<!-- --><span>WHERE</span> amenity<!-- --><span>=</span><span>&#39;hospital&#39;</span>;
<!-- --></code></pre>
<!-- --><p>For my purpose I wanted a point to represent each hospital, so I just calculated the
centroid of each polygon with the <!-- --><code>ST_Centroid</code> function.
In both cases, I also projected the data into EPSG:4326.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><h3 id="isochrones">Isochrones</h3>
<!-- --><p>Once I had this list of hospitals and their locations, I needed to find the
area representing the maximum travel time around each of them.
For this, I used set up Valhalla&#39;s Isochrones API on the OSM extract.
This API uses the road structure and speed limits to determine the boundary
that can be traveled within a given time.</p>
<!-- --><p>The API also allows multiple time boundaries to be specified at once,
reducing the number of API calls required.
The following payload was used to request the isochrone for each hospital.
Here we provide the coordinates of each hospital and specify that we want
isochrones provided for 10, 20, 30, and 40 minute boundaries.</p>
<!-- --><p>The API returns a geoJSON polygon for each contour.</p>
<!-- --><pre><code>name = record[<!-- --><span>&#34;name&#34;</span>]
lon = record[<!-- --><span>&#34;lon&#34;</span>]
lat = record[<!-- --><span>&#34;lat&#34;</span>]

payload = {
    <!-- --><span>&#34;locations&#34;</span>:[
        {<!-- --><span>&#34;lat&#34;</span>: lat,<!-- --><span>&#34;lon&#34;</span>: lon}

request = <!-- --><span>f&#34;http://localhost:8002/isochrone?json=<!-- --><span>{json.dumps(payload)}</span>&#34;<!-- --></span>
isochrone = requests.get(request).json()
<!-- --></code></pre>
<!-- --><p>After calculating the polygons for each hospital, I found the union of
all polygons at each contour level.
This meant that overlapping polygons of the same level were joined together.</p>
<!-- --><p>Let&#39;s dive into a result showing two hospitals in Virginia.
The two lime green splotches around each hospital represent the area that
is within a 10 minute drive of either hospital.
The turquoise boundary indicates the area where the drive time would be
between 10-20 minutes.
The purple boundary represents 20-30 minutes, and the pink boundary represents 30-40 minutes.
White represents a drive of at least 40 minutes to a hospital.</p>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://wcedmisten.fyi/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/hospital-isochrones.png" alt="Isochrones Map of Two Hospitals in Central Virginia"/></p>
<!-- --><p>This can be displayed for the entire state:</p>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://wcedmisten.fyi/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/virginia-isochrones-big.png" alt="Isochrones Map of Two Hospitals in Central Virginia"/></p>
<!-- --><p>Even at a high level, we can see regions with better and worse hospital accessibility.
Generally, hospitals cluster around cities, which can also be seen here.
Northern VA, Richmond, Norfolk and VA Beach show up mostly green.
Low-accessibility areas (white) are mostly in central and southwest VA.</p>
<!-- --><h2 id="population-analysis">Population Analysis</h2>
<!-- --><p>Although it&#39;s clear many places in Virginia are far from hospitals (plenty of white on the map),
I was curious what percentage of residents this distribution truly affects.
Since most Americans live in cities, perhaps these areas are mostly unpopulated.</p>
<!-- --><p>To answer this question, I turned to a dataset provided by the European Union:
The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHS) Population dataset <!-- --><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-ghs-pop" id="user-content-fnref-ghs-pop" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">6</a></sup>.
This dataset provides an estimate of population distribution across the entire globe.
The dataset is formatted as an image of 100m x 100m squares, each containing the
estimated population residing in each square.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>The following image shows the raw data provided in an extract of this dataset.
The brighter colors indicate a higher population.
The concentrations of bright colors indicate cities.
However, due to the unconventional projection used
(Mollweide <!-- --><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-mollweide" id="user-content-fnref-mollweide" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">7</a></sup>), the image appears slanted and skewed compared to
a more traditional projection. The missing chunk in the bottom right
corner is the Atlantic Ocean.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://wcedmisten.fyi/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/GHS-POP.png" alt="GHS Population Image Visualized"/></p>
<!-- --><h3 id="rasterstats">Rasterstats</h3>
<!-- --><p>The Python library rasterstats <!-- --><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-rasterstats" id="user-content-fnref-rasterstats" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">8</a></sup> was created to calculate statistics
over geospatial raster image datasets like GHS-POP.
By supplying a polygon and the image file, the library will calculate various statistics
about the data contained in that polygon.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Since the dataset is in Mollweide and my polygons are in EPSG:4326,
I had to transform the polygons into Mollweide before using them.</p>
<!-- --><pre><code><span>def</span> <!-- --><span>estimate_population</span>(<!-- --><span>dataset, geom</span>):
  polygon = shape(geom)

  project_to_mollweide = pyproj.Transformer.from_proj(

          pyproj.Proj(<!-- --><span>&#39;esri:54009&#39;</span>),
          always_xy=<!-- --><span>True</span>

  <!-- --><span>return</span> <!-- --><span>round</span>(zs[<!-- --><span>0</span>][<!-- --><span>&#34;sum&#34;</span>])
<!-- --></code></pre>
<!-- --><p>To sanity check my approach for estimating population, I used the boundaries of Washington DC,
and compared the result to the official census record.</p>
<!-- --><pre><code><span>with</span> <!-- --><span>open</span>(<!-- --><span>&#34;dc.json&#34;</span>, <!-- --><span>&#34;r&#34;</span>) <!-- --><span>as</span> f:
   dc_geom = json.load(f)

<!-- --><span>print</span>(estimate_population(dataset, dc_geom))
<!-- --></code></pre>
<!-- --><p>This outputs:</p>
<!-- --><pre><code>707662
</code></pre>
<!-- --><p>Compared to the official 2020 census estimate <!-- --><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-census-dc-estimate" id="user-content-fnref-census-dc-estimate" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">9</a></sup> of 712,816, this is off by less than 1%.
Not bad!<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><h3 id="population-estimates-on-hospital-isochrones">Population Estimates on Hospital Isochrones</h3>
<!-- --><p>In my case, I just needed to sum all the values inside the polygon to get the total population.
I just supplied each multipolygon of joined contours at each level
(10 mins, 20 mins, 30 mins, and 40 mins), and the library calculated the population
within each one.</p>
<!-- --><p>Another consideration was that I needed to intersect the Virginia state boundary with
the Isochrones that were calculated. This is due to an artifact of how OSM extracts work.
When OSM extracts get made, they do not cut off existing features exactly at state
boundaries. So our dataset includes roads in bordering states, which means our
isochrones will leak into these states as well.</p>
<!-- --><p>If we allowed this leakage to happen, our population estimates would include some
residents from neighboring states, causing a misleading statistic when calculating the percentage.</p>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://wcedmisten.fyi/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/isochrone-overflow.png" alt="GHS Population Image Visualized"/></p>
<!-- --><p>However, using <!-- --><code>shapely</code>, we can calculate the intersection of the VA boundary against the
isochrones to remove any residents from other states.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>In the intersection, we can see that the isochrone boundaries no longer leak into other states.</p>

<!-- --><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<!-- --><p>These results are kind of surprising! From the map, it&#39;s not obvious that
99% of Virginia residents are within 40 minutes of a hospital because there
is a lot of white space on the map.
It&#39;s also interesting that 65% of the population lives in 9% of the area
that&#39;s within 10 minutes of a hospital.</p>
<!-- --><p>Another interesting conclusion is that only 1% of the VA population lives
in the remaining 20% of Virginia which is 40+ minutes from a hospital.</p>
<!-- --><p>On the other hand, looking at distance to the nearest hospital is only
one piece of the puzzle. This metric by itself is a bit optimistic
because it does not account for the services offered at each hospital.
A patient seeking specialty care would find no comfort living next to
a hospital that doesn&#39;t provide what they need.
This metric also does not account for the value of multiple hospitals nearby,
which would grant more options to patients than a singular monopoly in the region.</p>
<!-- --><p>The data here is also crowd-sourced, and may not be 100% accurate or up to date.</p>
<!-- --><p>I went through the data and found some places where hospitals were tagged incorrectly.
In many cases, clinics were tagged as hospitals. I also found some
&#34;veterinary hospitals&#34; tagged as hospitals and fixed these occurrences.</p>
<!-- --><p>In my <!-- --><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/121w4f8/oc_map_of_hospital_accessibility_by_car_in/">reddit post</a>
on /r/dataisbeautiful, some users pointed out other inaccuracies,
such as hospitals that have since closed down.
I fixed the data where possible in OpenStreetMap, but other errors may still exist.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>If you see any more, feel free to point them my way, or fix them yourself on OpenStreetMap.</p>
<!-- --><h2 id="creating-the-self-hosted-interactive-map">Creating the Self-Hosted Interactive Map</h2>
<!-- --><p>Once I had the data, I still wanted to display it in a more interactive format.
It&#39;s one thing to see the data on my own computer, but I wanted to share it with the world!</p>
<!-- --><p>Normally, this would require setting up a backend to serve map tiles.
However, using some new open source tools, I could create an interactive map
with only a few MB of files hosted in a CDN.
No backend is required. No paid subscription to a service like Google Maps or Mapbox.
No additional costs.</p>
<!-- --><p>I was inspired by Kevin Schaul&#39;s article<!-- --><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-washington-post-maps" id="user-content-fnref-washington-post-maps" data-footnote-ref="true" aria-describedby="footnote-label">10</a></sup> about The Washington Post adopting

It supports panning and zooming around the map, making it interactive.</p>
<!-- --><p>The project is an open source fork of Mapbox GL JS, which was

This library uses vector tiles rather than raster tiles,

<!-- --><p>This awesome piece of software is changing the game for serving map tiles.
Instead of requiring a tile server running on a backend to serve tiles
at specific coordinates, Protomaps uses HTTP range requests to directly
query a single file, which can be hosted as a static asset on a CDN.</p>
<!-- --><p>This approach is similar to how web clients streaming video can seek to a timestamp
without downloading the whole file. The client only downloads what they need,
rather than burdening the server with unnecessary bandwidth.
This also saves time for the client.</p>

<!-- --><h2 id="generating-the-files">Generating the Files</h2>

<!-- --><li>Add a GeoJSON data source for the hospital locations and names</li>
<!-- --><li>Add a layer into the style spec for displaying these names with a custom symbol I made in GIMP</li>
<!-- --></ol>
<!-- --><h3 id="a-note-on-colors">A note on colors</h3>
<!-- --><p>I based the color of each distance threshold on the viridis color scheme, which uses yellow on one end
and dark purple on the other.</p>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://wcedmisten.fyi/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/viridis.png" alt="viridis color map"/></p>
<!-- --><p>However, due to opacity and how the polygons were layered on top of each other,
the colors didn&#39;t quite come out right.
The colors shown on the legend would match the colors of the polygon if opacity
was set to 1.
But because they&#39;re transparent, the background colors bleed into them.
This resulted in a confusing color scale in my legend, as many users on /r/dataisbeautiful
<!-- --><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/121w4f8/comment/jdpdv6s/">tactfully pointed out</a>.<!-- --></p>

<!-- --><p>I couldn&#39;t figure out how to determine the actual color as presented in the map,
so I ended up taking a screenshot and finding the RGB values with a color inspector tool.
But even using <!-- --><em>those</em> values, the colors still looked wrong.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>I think this was because of the way that colors can appear different to the brain based on context.
For example, the <!-- --><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checker_shadow_illusion">Checker Shadow Illusion</a>.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://wcedmisten.fyi/visualizing-hospital-accessibility/color-illusion.png" alt="optical illusion of checkerboard colors appearing different from a shadow"/></p>
<!-- --><p>The colors of A and B are actually the same. 100% identical RGB codes. This hurts my brain.</p>
<!-- --><p>I ended up just tweaking these colors manually until they looked about right to me.</p>

<!-- --><p>The colors still don&#39;t match 100%, but at least they
can be matched to the corresponding map color now.</p>

<!-- --><p>I&#39;d like to get this visualization set up for the entire United States,
and eventually compare metrics between states.</p>
<!-- --><p>As an intermediate step, I ran this code with an extract of the US South region.</p>
<!-- --><p>One issue I ran into was that WebGL, which is used by MapLibreGL to render
vector tiles, can only render 65,535 vertices.
With my massive isochrone polygons, I was hitting this limit at low zoom levels.</p>
<!-- --><p>The solution to this was to pass <!-- --><code>--simplify 6</code> to my tippecanoe file generation
command, to reduce the number of points needed for each polygon.
This also reduces the accuracy slightly, but at high zoom levels it&#39;s
not really noticeable.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><h3 id="filtering-by-service">Filtering by Service</h3>
<!-- --><p>Another enhancement would be to allow filtering hospitals by services offered.
It would be interesting to see how this map looks for a patient seeking specialty medicine.
I&#39;m not quite sure where to get a standardized dataset of services offered by hospital,
so if anyone has a suggestion, please reach out!</p>
