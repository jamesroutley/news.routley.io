						<p>Our particular app (Amazing Slow Downer) lets the user play music more slowly, since a couple of years ago also songs from Spotify. The &#34;ios-streaming-sdk&#34; is a beautifully designed framework that lets an audio developer do practically everything needed.</p><p>We have many users that uses Spotify. Many users switch from other streaming services such as &#34;Apple Music&#34;, Tidal, Amazon Music etc to Spotify just to be able to slow down streaming music in real time.</p><p>We believe our app gives Spotify many many new subscribers, so many that it would actually pay off for Spotify to maintain the &#34;ios-streaming-sdk&#34;.</p><p>We only use &#34;playlist&#34; functions and after fixing a couple of bugs in the &#34;metadata framework&#34; available on github, everything works 100%. Although there are certainly some bugs in the “ios-streaming-sdk”, they are very few and don’t affect our app.</p><p>We also have an Android version of our app that uses your Android streaming SDK and it also works very good.</p><p>We believe Spotify will loose thousands of users, so many that the minimal cost Spotify need to spend on maintenance will pay off manifold.</p><p>Since our app also supports playback and slowing down of streaming Apple Music, many of our users will probably switch from subscribing to Spotify to subscribing to Apple Music.</p><p>&#34;After September 1st, important functionality in the streaming SDKs will stop working.&#34;</p>
