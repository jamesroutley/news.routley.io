    <h1>Identity and Concurrency</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Regarding a resource – dataset, model, tool, standard, agent, etc. – as a single thing can be helpful: in allocating physical space, in dealing with privacy and responsibility, in de-confusing mental activity.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Are human mental processes actually clean “streams of consciousness”, or is narrative a tool used to “straighten things out”, to simplify the representation of what happened? Is there really a single pipeline of ideas that flow through a mind?</p>
<p>And is a straightened-out story faithful to “raw” observation, or was a schema employed, a design pattern, an archetype, such as The Hero’s Journey?</p>
<p>In computing, modeling a workflow as a single process, a sequence of actions, is easiest for us mentally. As opposed to multiple concurrent processes.</p>
<p>And yet it is often operationally helpful to support concurrency via resource properties like immutability, idempotence, etc., even if we later explain “what happened” – if we later communicate activity provenance to fellow human beings – as a single process, a story, a linear narrative.</p>
