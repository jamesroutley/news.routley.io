    <h1>Starting a food co-op: Year 1</h1>

The land got bought </span><span><a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2021/08/17/russos-watertown-closing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for $36.5M to a real estate developer</a></span><span> to build out labs, and sadly 200 employees were laid off as the business shuttered. The store had been a normal part of my shopping routine since I moved back to Boston in 2018, and for thousands of families a staple for everything from weeknight veggies to holiday specials. Russo‚Äôs had an immense selection of produce thanks to their distribution business, an impeccable cheese counter, a bakery, florist, a small nursery, but not much in the way of dry goods or paper products. It wasn‚Äôt a store you could get everything at, but what it was‚Ä¶well, it was unlike other chain groceries or farm stands:</span></span></p><div id="block-a54cecfb16664e30b5185fc8d3c299a4"><p><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27384%27%20height=%27480%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="A typical display at Russo‚Äôs" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></p><figcaption><span><span>A typical display at Russo‚Äôs</span></span></figcaption></div><p><span><span>In the checkout lines on my last few visits to the store, I started wondering why there weren‚Äôt any community-owned grocery stores nearby. After some quick searching, I learned that there were no open food co-operatives in all of Eastern or Central Massachusetts. Two groups had been organizing for over 9 years each in Maynard and Dorchester - and both broke ground over the summer as </span><span><a href="http://assabetmarket.coop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assabet Co-op Market</a></span><span> and </span><span><a href="http://dorchesterfoodcoop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dorchester Food Co-op</a></span><span>. I had my first call with the </span><span><a href="https://fci.coop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Food Co-op Initiative</a></span><span> in late August - which gave me some great pointers for how to get started. </span></span></p><div id="block-f76fa8273dfd45a886451fc33f8c3cf0"><p><span>üó≥Ô∏è</span></p><p><span><span><strong>WHY a co-op? </strong></span><span>Why is this model of building a business not more popular? Here‚Äôs my simple take: it‚Äôs harder. It‚Äôs harder to build consensus and practice democracy in action to get something done. The results of equal and shared ownership are immense though: you build up real power for those who don‚Äôt have access to it and along the way provide a ton of great food and jobs to your neighbors. We need more of these in our communities.</span></span></p></div><p><span><span>A few Facebook groups cropped up as shoppers lamented and rallied around trying to save the store. I quickly found my first co-operator, Tim, and we set off trying to see if anyone at the store wanted to start a co-op, but we didn‚Äôt get far with that approach. Tim ran food co-ops in the 70s in Florida and Philadelphia, and has been involved in political organizing for years. He suggested we get some tables at local events and try to see if there was interest in starting a new food co-op. I had registered a domain and built a small site for the ‚ÄúWatertown Food Co-op‚Äù so we ran with that name and booked us some spots at two fall-themed fairs in Watertown and Newton.</span></span></p><div id="block-46551e86129740a3a77a78241712c7cc"><p><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27432%27%20height=%27432%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="Tim and I at our first event, Watertown‚Äôs Faire on the Square" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></p><figcaption><span><span>Tim and I at our first event, Watertown‚Äôs Faire on the Square</span></span></figcaption></div><p><span><span>These initial events proved to be a huge success for us - we got around 500 emails and names as pledges to be members. We clearly were on to something the community needed! Coupled with around 1500 emails from an </span><span><a href="http://ActionNetwork.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ActionNetwork.org</a></span><span> petition to save the old store, we had built the beginning of a movement.</span></span></p><p><span><span>So, how do we build a store from just emails? Luckily, the </span><span><a href="https://fci.coop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Food Co-op Initiative</a></span><span> wrote an entire playbook on how to do this:</span></span></p><p><span><span>We got the most basic to-do list for our startup from Greg Brodsky of </span><span><a href="https://start.coop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Start.coop</a></span><span>, an incubator for co-ops:</span></span></p><ol type="1"><li id="block-93f7acc10a2549069cf60fb72da5ea36"><span><span>Form steering committee</span></span></li><li id="block-f478719bdc164131939fbc4f04fb3235"><span><span>Get to 1000 people (members $100-200) interested</span></span></li><li id="block-cf32f0001eca4ad0bddc761d29d5b884"><span><span>Get 1 million in commitments at a 3-4% dividend with a matching loan from either </span><span><a href="https://cooperativefund.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CFNE</a></span><span> or </span><span><a href="https://www.leaffund.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEAF</a></span></span></li><li id="block-34df04b309b240519898b52dceeb7dc9"><span><span>Start building!</span></span></li></ol><h2 id="block-7c2fba43255d46e0a83360c7881e399a"><span id="7c2fba43255d46e0a83360c7881e399a"></span><span><span>Winter 2021</span></span></h2><p><span><span>We got into the swing of organizing over the winter months, with our cadence of bi-weekly Zoom calls for our steering committee in full swing. We figured out quite a lot in this period:</span></span></p><ul><li id="block-f34d83bca12a4ac886d0d0d0610dfc59"><span><span>Built a steering committee of ~10-15 interested and committed folks</span></span></li><li id="block-2faebbbe54c24bd48afb7d34c9c3b6ee"><span><span>Decided on a more town-inclusive name: the Charles River Food Co-op</span></span></li><li id="block-9d3578b97ce34e8ca3aac3b37dd109f2"><span><span>Sent out a survey to 2000+ emails to help identify what the co-op‚Äôs share price, focus, and other community needs were</span></span></li><li id="block-951e950aac0340fe9610edbc55eb9c78"><span><span>Became associate members of the </span><span><a href="https://nfca.coop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neighboring Food Co-op Association</a></span><span>, our regional association of startup + open food co-ops</span></span></li><li id="block-98762e601fd645f08fcd5063cdca6359"><span><span>Joined a peer group of food co-ops led by JQ Hannah at </span><span><a href="https://fci.coop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Food Co-op Initiative</a></span><span> (HUGELY helpful!)</span></span></li><li id="block-a83248f50c0c44458014085fa741afab"><span><span>Tons of learning about co-operatives, governance, equity models, and more</span></span></li><li id="block-559ce9890aa543d6965d50b893ef7018"><span><span>First drafts of and subcommittee to decide our mission + vision, now focused around </span><span><a href="http://charlesriverfood.coop/our-mission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">diversity, sustainability, and community</a></span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>The dive into governance at this stage was most important for us. We settled on becoming a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù multi-stakeholder co-op - where the consumers and workers of the store are both owners. Our board will eventually have:</span></span></p><ul><li id="block-a384d26481c44814b65b6fea2a01e374"><span><span>4 consumer-owner representatives</span></span></li><li id="block-912ec8b28a2040d59bf680bba2365667"><span><span>4 worker-owner representatives</span></span></li><li id="block-579edb0618a44cb09ff3d6b736150548"><span><span>1 seat that the 8 above can elect to bring a specific skill set or need into the co-op</span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>One regret I have from this phase is not publishing the work we were doing publicly. Luckily, we kept good meeting notes in a running Google Doc - make sure to do this in some fashion so you don‚Äôt forget what was discussed!</span></span></p><h2 id="block-5c92ad8ef03c4538b10a1de50af7a686"><span id="5c92ad8ef03c4538b10a1de50af7a686"></span><span><span>Spring 2022</span></span></h2><p><span><span>We filed our Articles of Organization to become an official corporation in late March. At our first meeting in April we became a real co-op by moving to adopt </span><span><a href="http://charlesriverfood.coop/bylaws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our by-laws</a></span><span>. These were modeled after </span><span><a href="http://dorchesterfoodcoop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dorchester Food Co-op</a></span><span>‚Äôs by-laws, and we are very grateful for Co-operative Principle 6 which encourages co-ops to cooperate among other co-ops. We were lucky to win a grant to attend the </span><span><a href="http://upandcoming.coop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Up &amp; Coming Conference</a></span><span> in Madison, WI - a 2 day event dedicated entirely to this space.</span></span></p><div id="block-55c9570f01b6492aa3a6086044443935"><p><span>üá∫üá∏</span></p><p><span><span><strong>Bureaucracy alert! </strong></span><span>If you are seeking to form a new co-operative in Massachusetts. You cannot use the online form provided by the Secretary of the Commonwealth to create your corporation.

We learned this the hard way, by first using the online form and then needing to request a refund by filling out a PDF manually and emailing it. Next, after DocuSigning and printing out our Articles, I tried to file in-person in downtown Boston. Filing in-person was rejected for a few reasons, the most egregious of which included that my 8 other co-operators did not sign the document physically with a pen. On our third attempt, we faxed it and that worked.

Please support any legislation to make this process easier for more co-ops in MA - making it possible to file online in 2022 should not be controversial.</span></span></p></div><p><span><span>Thanks to the wonderful </span><span><a href="https://www.jacobwaites.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacob Waites</a></span><span>, a Watertown based designer, we also came up a new brand and identity during this season:</span></span></p><div id="block-b319f9d7a9c44c67863ece389a1892c6"><p><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27480%27%20height=%27480%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="Our logo - complete with the river inside it" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></p><figcaption><span><span>Our logo - complete with the river inside it</span></span></figcaption></div><p><span><span>I also whipped up a </span><span><a href="https://charlesriverfood.coop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quick Squarespace website</a></span><span> and included one of the store renderings that Jacob made, which we have consistently gotten feedback that </span><span><em>seeing a store</em></span><span>, even if fake, is a huge signal that we are serious about building one.</span></span></p><p><span><span>An important decision made during this season was also to use Mailchimp as our email/newsletter software as well as our CRM.

We laid the groundwork for this thanks once again to advice from FCI, and the basic process went like this:</span></span></p><ol type="1"><li id="block-40012bee61be450993b398b93e6d57d5"><span><span>‚ÄúPrime the pump‚Äù email newsletter ~1 week before about the membership drive campaign</span></span></li><li id="block-b3658de30c7f409f916a74383f41410e"><span><span>‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù email newsletter and press release to local publications (some just directly posted this on our behalf!)</span></span></li><li id="block-0eeff8b083094078b14bb090a38c764e"><span><span>‚ÄúHey, remember us?‚Äù email newsletter ~1 week after ‚ÄúLaunch‚Äù</span></span></li></ol><p><span><span>We saw an immense response to this campaign - over 200 members bought into the co-op in June alone. We allow members to pay $200 up-front or $25 over 8 months for a share which is good for life. Stripe Checkout made building this out extremely easy, and we saw great uptake with allowing members to cover the credit card processing fee for us as an add-on. We recently hit 400 members and I built this visualization of our growth curve out, which has been tapering a bit but still impressive:</span></span></p><div id="block-a3e30133460a4932b844ea7ee4361953"><p><span><span><img alt="" aria-hidden="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27480%27%20height=%27478.69031377899046%27/%3e"/></span><img alt="A huge start and momentum!" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="intrinsic"/></span></p><figcaption><span><span>A huge start and momentum!</span></span></figcaption></div><p><span><span>Our first committees started forming around this time as well, and it will be interesting to see these evolve through the years:</span></span></p><ul><li id="block-1da105f5a3454555a7ef0b1db49cb5d2"><span><span>Community/Outreach</span></span></li><li id="block-163e9d4c5a5b4840b51e2e62c563c781"><span><span>Marketing</span></span></li><li id="block-b66e14e6d8ba4f09b107bc32560ab593"><span><span>Finance/Biz Dev</span></span></li><li id="block-b835aad98fbd4fc7a305a5125fa36aa0"><span><span>Membership</span></span></li><li id="block-bea9cba45968497db2f828d09dbebbd5"><span><span>Governance</span></span></li></ul><p><span><span>These are the basic categories of work we have to do as a board. Giving each board member and committed volunteers the power to get things done under their purview without requiring a full vote from the board is a big deal. If we don‚Äôt delegate work, the co-op stops moving! I have been trying to instill that early, but I‚Äôm still learning this skill too.</span></span></p><p><span><span>We also spent the summer struggling to make meetings work as normal due to vacations and more - a good reminder for next year that we should consider our cadence in advance.
