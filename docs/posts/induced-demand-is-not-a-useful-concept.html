    <h1>Induced demand is not a useful concept</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>Here’s a post fleshing out some of the ideas I advanced in </span><a href="https://twitter.com/bswud/status/1711453152908873982" rel="">a recent Twitter thread</a><span>. Basically I defend three ideas: first, Induced demand is not a useful idea. Second, infrastructure, including roads, is good, even if we become dependent on it. Third, transport (and the infrastructure that enables it) is a crucial way we get agglomeration, and roads are one good way of generating it. Roads are good, even though they have substantial downsides.</span></p><ol><li><p><strong>Induced demand is not a useful concept – the demand is always there, latent</strong></p></li></ol><p>There is a popular idea that if you build extra road infrastructure, it will just be filled up with new traffic, and thus, this extra roadspace hasn’t done anything to relieve traffic congestion. This theory is known as ‘induced demand’. Strictly, it is false, and we shouldn’t let it stop us building more roads, as doing so would make us richer and happier. However, this doesn’t mean more roadspace is good in every location. In fact, there are many places, like residential streets and city centres, which may have too much driving.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991d7418-5adb-4189-a26f-fe3083a0fce7_1200x630.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991d7418-5adb-4189-a26f-fe3083a0fce7_1200x630.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991d7418-5adb-4189-a26f-fe3083a0fce7_1200x630.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991d7418-5adb-4189-a26f-fe3083a0fce7_1200x630.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991d7418-5adb-4189-a26f-fe3083a0fce7_1200x630.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991d7418-5adb-4189-a26f-fe3083a0fce7_1200x630.jpeg" width="464" height="243.6" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/991d7418-5adb-4189-a26f-fe3083a0fce7_1200x630.jpeg&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:630,&#34;width&#34;:1200,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:464,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;One more lane will fix it - a meme, until it actually does - paultan.org&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:false,&#34;topImage&#34;:true,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="One more lane will fix it - a meme, until it actually does - paultan.org" title="One more lane will fix it - a meme, until it actually does - paultan.org" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991d7418-5adb-4189-a26f-fe3083a0fce7_1200x630.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991d7418-5adb-4189-a26f-fe3083a0fce7_1200x630.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991d7418-5adb-4189-a26f-fe3083a0fce7_1200x630.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F991d7418-5adb-4189-a26f-fe3083a0fce7_1200x630.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"/></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Memes like this are often shared with captions like ‘just one more lane bro’.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>In a sense, the claims behind induced demand are true: in many cities there is such latent demand for driving that building extra road infrastructure – and charging nothing to those who wish to use it – will lead to </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3785888" rel="">no reduction</a><span> in </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967070X18301720" rel="">congestion</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>Famously, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smeed_Report" rel="">RJ Smeed</a><span> predicted in 1949 that London’s average road speeds would always be roughly </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smeed%27s_law" rel="">9mph</a><span>, which they remained at for </span><a href="https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/london-needs-real-road-pricing" rel="">seventy years</a><span> after this prediction. Any slower, and people took the tube, cycled, walked, or stayed at home; any faster, and more drivers flooded onto the road until it came back down.</span></p><p><span>But in another more important sense it is not true: more roadspace means more journeys. Even if the road looks just as congested, four congested lanes are carrying more people to their desired destinations than three or two congested lanes. One study of widening the M25 found that journey times worsened over the same period. But even in this study, </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/601565/M25_J23-27_SM-ALR_Monitoring_Yr2_Evaluation_v2.0.pdf" rel="">the road let over 10% more people through</a><span> the relevant junctions. (In fact, roads in general were seeing worsening times, and M25 speeds would likely have worsened more if not for the expansion.)</span></p><p><span>The demand is not really ‘induced’: it’s more true to say that it was always there – when the roads don’t exist to accommodate it you could call it </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/762976/latest-evidence-on-induced-travel-demand-an-evidence-review.pdf" rel="">‘suppressed demand’</a><span>. If we offer more subsidised social housing, </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5c488d5bed915d38961cb9c5/Local_Authority_Housing_Statistics_England_year_ending_March_2018.pdf" rel="">more people tend to live in it</a><span> – would we then say that demand for social housing has been ‘induced’?</span></p><p>Imagine a city with acute food shortages and controlled prices (e.g. Caracas, Pyongyang). People join long queues before bakeries daily, and still only average half their calorie needs. The supply of bread then improves so that they average 60% of their calorie needs instead. Would we really expect the queues to wither away? Of course not. They might not even get discernibly shorter. Does this mean that demand for bread is in some peculiar and distinctive sense ‘induced’? Of course not. Does it mean that going from 50% to 60% of calorie needs is not an improvement? Again, of course not.</p><ol start="2"><li><p><strong>More and better infrastructure lets us spread out and enjoy more space</strong></p></li></ol><p><span>A sophisticated version of the induced demand story says that as well as driving more on a better road network, people faced with a better road network, over time, shift towards living more car-dependent lifestyles. This is true. When infrastructure is reliable, people begin to depend on it. As a train commuter, I live a train-dependent lifestyle and when Southeastern trains (currently </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Eastern_franchise#:~:text=to%20two%20years.-,2021%3A%20Southeastern%20(DfT),operate%20under%20the%20Southeastern%20name." rel="">run by the Department for Transport</a><span>) recently </span><a href="https://www.southeasternrailway.co.uk/travel-information/live-travel-information/timetable-updates" rel="">reduced the frequency</a><span> at my station by 2tph I was incensed. If the trains had never existed, I would never have moved to </span><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/London_Underground_Overground_DLR_Crossrail_map_zone.svg" rel="">Zone 3</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>When our best mode of transport was walking, cities had a </span><a href="https://www.createstreets.com/why-gentle-density-is-a-key-part-of-the-levelling-up-puzzle/" rel="">maximum size</a><span>. Once things got more than a few miles – an hour’s walk – wide, it was beyond the distance where agglomeration was possible. So if there were sufficiently big advantages to the city – as in Ancient Rome, medieval Constantinople and Paris, or Georgian London – people built apartment buildings up and squeezed more and more people into the existing space. </span></p><p><span>Life was horribly overcrowded. In 1910, the densest tract of New York had around </span><a href="https://www.lincolninst.edu/sites/default/files/pubfiles/1834_1085_angel_final_1.pdf" rel="">150,000 people per square kilometer</a><span>. Overall </span><a href="https://urbanomnibus.net/2014/10/the-rise-and-fall-of-manhattans-density" rel="">Victorian Manhattan</a><span> had about 60,000 people per square kilometer across the city – as densely packed as its densest district today, and higher than famously crammed </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka" rel="">Dhaka</a><span> today. </span></p><p><span>This was all lifted with infrastructure like the horse-drawn omnibus, and commuter train lines (</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_and_Greenwich_Railway" rel="">Greenwich to London Bridge was London’s first</a><span> – the world’s </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_and_Kingstown_Railway#:~:text=The%20D%26KR%20was%20also%20notable,to%20build%20its%20own%20locomotives." rel="">Dublin to Kingstown</a><span>).

But they do this with every technology. This is just how demand works – it’s not a special type of ‘induced’ demand.</p><p><span>So induced demand is not a helpful concept. We use roads because we want to get around, which we want whether or not roads exist. The upshot is that road infrastructure is good. Overall, for example, the US interstate highways are </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/iere.12640" rel="">responsible for about four percent of US GDP</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>The UK’s decision in the 1700s to allow private organisations to take over 11,000 miles of roads, charge tolls, and use the money for improvements, which led to ‘turnpike mania’, increased average road speeds from </span><a href="https://www.campop.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/projects/transport/onlineatlas/britishturnpiketrusts.pdf" rel="">2.6mph to 6.2mph</a><span>. It, along with the canal boom at the same time, was surely an important ingredient into the industrial revolution.</span></p><ol start="3"><li><p><strong>Transport is very important, and roads can provide a lot of it</strong></p></li></ol><p>When we get in our cars to go somewhere, it’s because we value doing so – because we can go to work, to pick up something we need, meet a friend, or visit a family member. Roads are also an essential way we transport goods around and get emergency services where they are needed. We have an enormous latent demand for trips, and the more infrastructure we build, the more trips we do. </p><p><span>On top of the value you get from the roads you actually drive on, there is a bonus value to having infrastructure out there that you </span><em>could</em><span> use. You don’t know whether you will want to visit an Ethiopian restaurant, or get job on a specific side of town, regularly, or even ever, but you will likely still value this option.</span></p><p><span>Infrastructure owners, such as airports, can profit from this. But even if we do have tolls or road pricing it’s hard for those running the roads to charge you prices that fully reflect this benefit you get, since they can only charge you for the trips you </span><em>do</em><span> take, which means that the value these options create is usually ‘captured’ not by infrastructure operators, but by house prices, because people pay more to live near infrastructure which offers lots of potential.</span></p><p><span>Airports show this very clearly. You will take only a tiny infinitesimal fraction of the potential flights you could take from your nearest airport. But each year you enjoy having the </span><em>option</em><span> of taking them, since you don’t know where you might want to travel in future. Thus, airlines and airports capture only a tiny fraction of the value they create, and instead of paying airlines people pay to live nearby airports. </span></p><p><span>Living near Heathrow gives you many more options than living near Stansted, and living near Stansted is worlds apart from living near a small regional airport.
