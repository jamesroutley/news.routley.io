    <h1>T-Mobile will start charging a $35 fee on all new activations and upgrades</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>T-Mobile may be joining rivals Verizon and AT&amp;T by introducing an $35 charge for all new postpaid activations and upgrades, according to <a href="https://tmo.report/2022/10/t-mobile-will-force-a-new-35-activation-fee-on-nearly-every-transaction/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><em>The T-Mo Report</em></a> and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/yijmbw/i_will_just_leave_this_here/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0">Redditors</a>. According to T-Mobile internal documents, it&#39;s introducing a &#34;Device Connection Charge&#34; for &#34;all activations and upgrades for mobile, Beyond the Smartphone and broadband devices.&#34;</p>
<p>Before, the Uncarrier charged activation fees only if you received in-store customer support for new activations, with online orders exempt. Now, all new postpaid activations are charged, whether or not you were assisted. This includes updating to a new device, adding a Bring-Your-Own-Device line, or ordering a Home Internet line, according to <em>The T-Mo Report</em>.</p>
<p>T-Mobile has always tried to separate itself from regular telecoms, but charging customers for essentially nothing doesn&#39;t sound very Uncarrier-like, if the reports are accurate. And you can&#39;t take your business to Sprint, as it no longer exists thanks to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-t-mobile-completes-sprint-merger.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">merger with T-Mobile</a>.  When that deal was finalized, T-Mobile said things would be &#34;<a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/brand/t-mobile-sprint-merger-updates" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0">better for customers</a>,&#34; but constant activation charges would definitely not be better.</p>
<p>Worse, it appears to be justifying the new fee in a dubious way, saying it&#39;s &#34;simplifying&#34; the system to bring a &#34;more consistent and straightforward experience for customers.&#34; In other words, you&#39;ll no longer need to wonder if you&#39;ll get soaked for the charge or not — you definitely will. Engadget has reached out to T-Mobile to confirm the report&#39;s accuracy.  </p></div><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
