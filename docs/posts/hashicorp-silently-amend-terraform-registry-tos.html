    <h1>HashiCorp silently amend Terraform Registry TOS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div disabled="" sortable="">
<div>
          <p dir="auto">FWIW, a while ago I created an MIT-licensed OSS project <a href="https://github.com/paraterraform/para"><code>para</code></a> to manage terraform plugins. If I recall correctly, this was out even before Terraform Registry (TFR) was GA.</p>
<p dir="auto">The idea behind <code>para</code> is to provide greater control over package indices, as well as an option to maintain personal or fully local indices. What it means is that one can use a Github repo to build out a community repo, or each plugin maintainer can provider their own feed which can be referenced on per-project basis.</p>
<p dir="auto">I&#39;d imagine that unless there is way to make things working with TFR [without violating licenses], <code>para</code> can be used as an alternative, or can inspire plugin management system to be built within OpenTF.</p>
<p dir="auto">I haven&#39;t used Terraform for a while so IDK if HashiCorp broke the interface used by <code>para</code> (in which case it should be easy to fix <code>para</code>,  or extend OpenTF to provide a new and more convenient integration interface fir plugin management).</p>
<p dir="auto">P.S.: I used FUSE in <code>para</code> to inject TF-compatible file structures and plugin contents in runtime to avoid need for extra configuration, but in retrospective a FUSE-less mode powered by an additional config file to pre-load plugins would&#39;ve been a great addition. This one you would only need to invoke <code>para</code> once to rebuild TF plugin dir whenever you need to change/update plugin versions, rather than on every invocation.</p>
<p dir="auto">P.P.S.: Pun intended in a form of &#34;para-terraform,&#34; as in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Paraterraforming involves the construction of a habitable enclosure on a planet which eventually grows to encompass most of the planet&#39;s usable area.</p>
