    <h1>Astrée Static Analyzer for C and C&#43;&#43;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="pageContent"><div id="actualPage">

<p>Astrée is a static code analyzer that proves
the absence of run­time errors and invalid con­current behavior 
in safety-critical software written or gen­er­ated in C or C++.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/gallery.htm#shot6"><img src="https://www.absint.com/astree/shot5.png" alt="Astrée screenshot" title="" width="250" height="194"/></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/gallery.htm#shot4"><img src="https://www.absint.com/astree/shot7.png" alt="Astrée screenshot" title="" width="250" height="194"/></a></p>

<p>Astrée primarily targets embedded applications
as found in aero­nautics, earth trans­por­tation,
medical instrumen­tation, nuclear energy, and space flight.
Never­theless, it can just as well be used to analyze
any structured C/C++ programs, handwritten or generated,
with complex memory usages, dynamic memory allocation, and recursion.</p>

<p>Astrée is sound — that is, if no errors are signaled,
the absence of errors has been proved.</p>

<h3>Which runtime properties are analyzed by Astrée?</h3>
<p>Astrée statically analyzes whether the programming language is used 
correctly and whether there can be any run­time errors during 
any execution in any environment. This covers any use of C or C++ that, 
according to the corresponding language standard,
has undefined behavior or violates hardware-specific aspects.</p>

<p>Additionally, Astrée reports invalid concurrent behavior,
violations of user-specified programming guidelines,
and various program properties relevant for functional safety.</p>

<p>Astrée detects any:</p>
<ul>
<li>division by zero,</li>
<li>out-of-bounds array indexing,</li>
<li>erroneous pointer manipulation and dereferencing
(NULL, uninitialized and dangling pointers),</li>
<li>integer and floating-point arithmetic overflow,</li>
<li>read access to uninitialized variables,</li>
<li>data races (read/write or write/write concurrent accesses
by two threads to the same memory location without proper mutex locking),</li>
<li>inconsistent locking (lock/unlock problems),</li>
<li>invalid calls to operating system services
(e.g. OSEK calls to <code>TerminateTask</code> on a
task with unreleased resources),</li>
<li>other critical data and control-flow errors,</li>
<li>all violations of optional user-defined assertions to prove
additional runtime properties (similar to assert diagnostics),</li>
<li>code it can prove to be unreachable under any circumstances.</li>
</ul>

<p>Astrée is also sound for <a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/examples.htm#floatingpoint">floating-point computations</a>
and handles them precisely and safely. All possible rounding errors, 
and their cumu­lative effects, are taken into account. The same 
is true for −∞, +∞ and <code>NaN</code> values 
and their effects through arithmetic calculations and comparisons.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/compliance.htm#nist"><img src="https://www.absint.com/r_img/logo_nist.png" alt="NIST logo" title=""/></a></p>
<p>In 2020, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology 
<a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/compliance.htm#nist">determined</a> that Astrée satisfies
their criteria for sound static code analysis.</p>

<h3>Now with support for C++ and mixed code bases</h3>
<p>Since 2020, runtime error analysis can also be applied to C++ and mixed C/C++ code bases. 
The new analysis mode supports all modern C++ versions up to C++17 and many of the features known 
from the classic C code analysis.</p>
<p>Astrée’s C++ analysis uses the same technology 
as its C code analysis. It is designed to meet the characteristics 
of safety-critical embedded software, and is subject to the same 
restrictions as Astrée for C.</p>
<p>The high-level abstraction features and template library of C++
facilitate the design of very complex and dynamic software. 
Extensive use of these features may violate the established principles 
of safety-critical embedded software development and lead to
unsatisfactory analysis times and results. 
The Astrée manual gives recommendations on the use of C++ features
to ensure that the code can be well analyzed. For less constrained (less critical) C++ code, 
we recommend using the standalone RuleChecker.</p>

<h3>MISRA and more</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.absint.com/rulechecker/"><img src="https://www.absint.com/fp/logo_rulechecker.png" alt="RuleChecker logo" title=""/></a></p>
<p>The seamlessly integrated <a href="https://www.absint.com/rulechecker/">RuleChecker</a>
lets you check your code for compliance with various coding standards,
including <a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/compliance.htm#misra">MISRA</a>, 
<a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/compliance.htm#cwe">CWE</a>, 
<a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/compliance.htm#iso">ISO/IEC</a>, 
<a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/compliance.htm#cert">SEI CERT</a>, and 
<a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/compliance.htm#autosar">AUTOSAR</a>.
You can easily toggle individual rules and even specific aspects 
of certain rules. The tool can also check for various code metrics 
such as com­ment den­sity or cyclomatic complexity. 
Custom extensions for your own in-house coding guidelines 
are available on request.</p>
<p>RuleChecker can be envoked separately, to allow for even faster checks of your code, 
or in conjunction with the sound semantic analyses offered by Astrée,
to additionally guarantee zero false negatives and minimize false positives on semantical rules. 
No competing standalone MISRA checker can offer this, and no testing environment 
can match the full data and path coverage provided by the static analysis.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.absint.com/r_img/logo_airbus_120.png" width="120" height="25" alt="Airbus logo" title=""/></p>
<p>Since 2003, Airbus France has been using Astrée in the devel­opment 
of safety-critical software for vari­ous aircraft series, including the A380.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.absint.com/r_img/logo_bosch_h24.png" width="88" height="20" alt="Bosch logo" title=""/></p>
<p>In 2018, Bosch Automotive Steering <a href="https://www.absint.com/bosch_as.htm">replaced their legacy tools</a> with Astrée and RuleChecker, resulting in significant savings thanks to faster analyses, higher accuracy, and optimized licensing and support costs.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.absint.com/logos/framatome_120.png" width="120" height="23" alt="Framatome logo" title=""/></p>
<p>Framatome employs Astrée for verification
of their safety-critical TELEPERM XS platform that is used
for engineering, testing, commissioning, operating and troubleshooting nuclear reactors.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.absint.com/logos/helbako.png" width="110" height="17" alt="Helbako logo" title=""/></p>
<p>The global automotive supplier Helbako in Germany is using Astrée 
to guar­antee that no run­time errors can occur in their 
elec­tronic control software and to de­monstrate
<a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/compliance.htm#misra">MISRA compliance</a> of the code.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.absint.com/logos/esa.png" width="93" height="35" alt="ESA logo" title=""/></p>
<p>In 2008, Astrée proved the absence of any run­time errors
in a C ver­sion of the auto­matic docking software
of the Jules Verne Automated Transfer Vehicle, enabling
ESA to transport payloads to the Inter­national Space Station.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.absint.com/logos/ebmpapst.png" width="94" height="26" alt="ebm-papst logo" title=""/></p>
<p>A world leader in motors and ventilators for air-conditioning
and refrigeration systems, ebm-papst is using Astrée
for fully automatic conti­nuous verification of safety-critical
interrupt-driven control software for commu­tating high-efficiency
EC motors for venti­lator systems.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.absint.com/logos/mtu_fh.png" alt="MTU Friedrichshafen logo" title=""/></p>
<p>MTU Friedrichshafen uses Astrée to demonstrate the cor­rectness
of <a href="https://www.absint.com/mtu_fh.htm">con­trol software for emer­gency power gene­rators</a>

Astrée is part of the IEC 60880 certi­fication process.</p>

</div>

<h3>Tailor it to your own requirements</h3>
<p>Astrée offers powerful annotation mechanisms for supplying
external knowledge and fine-tuning the ana­lysis precision
for individual loops or data structures. Detailed messages and
an intui­tive GUI guide you to the exact cause of each 
potential runtime error. Actual errors can then be fixed, and in case 
of a false alarm the analyzer can be tuned to avoid it. 
This allows for analyses with very few or even zero false alarms.</p>

<h3>Ten years ahead of competition</h3>
<div>
<p>Astrée is…</p>


<ul>
<li id="li11"><h4>Sound</h4>
<p>Most static analyzers do not consider all possible run­time errors.
Others specifically focus on the most probable ones.</p>
<p>As a result, almost all competing tools can only be used for static testing
(i.e. finding some frequently occurring bugs), but never for verification
(i.e. proving the absence of any run­time errors).</p>
<p>In contrast, Astrée is <em>sound</em>. It always exhaustively considers
all pos­sible run­time errors. It will never omit pointing out a potential
run­time error. This is crucial for verification of safety-critical software.
At the same time, Astrée is capable of producing exactly
zero false alarms.</p>
<p>In 2020, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology 
<a href="https://www.absint.com/astree/compliance.htm#nist">determined</a> Astrée to be one out of 
only two tools in total that satisfy their criteria
for sound static code analysis.</p>
</li>
<li id="li12"><h4>Automatic</h4>
<p>Certain types of static analyzers, e.g. those relying on theorem provers, 
require programs to be annotated with lots of inductive invariants.</p>
<p>Astrée usually requires very few annotations. It can even run
<em>completely automatically</em> on certain types of programs, without
relying on any help from the user.</p>
<p>Many analyzers cannot be scripted at all. Others can, but won’t
let you access their analysis results outside of their proprietary viewer.
This actively prevents you from automating the analysis, e.g. as part of your
nightly build process.</p>
<p>In contrast, Astrée offers you complete access to the
analysis engine in batch mode, and lets you freely export the analysis
results and further process them in any way you choose, no strings attached.</p>
</li>
<li id="li13"><h4>Fast</h4>
<p>Many static analyzers have high computational costs (typically, 
sever­al hours of compu­tation per 10,000 lines of code); 
others terminate out of memory, or may not terminate at all.</p>
<p>In contrast, Astrée is <em>efficient</em> and easily scales
up to real-world pro­grams in industrial practice.</p>
<p>As an example, in order to ana­lyze actual flight-control software
with 132,000 lines of C code, even on a slow 2.8GHz PC
Astrée takes a mere 80 min­utes. Faster machines will get you
faster results. Multi­core parallel or distri­buted computation is supported.</p>
</li>
<li id="li14"><h4>Domain-aware</h4>
<p>General-purpose static analyzers aim at analyzing any application written
in a given pro­gram­ming language. They can rely on language
related properties to find potential run­time errors. Specialized
static analyzers put additional restrictions on the app­lications
so as to be able to take specific program structures into account.</p>
<p>In contrast, Astrée is <em>domain-aware</em>. It thus knows facts about
ap­pli­ca­tion domains that are indispensable to make sophisticated proofs.
For example, for control/command programs, Astrée takes the logic and
functional properties of control/command theory into account.</p>
</li>
<li id="li15"><h4>Parametric</h4>
<p>In static program analysis, there is always a trade-off between analysis
precision and analysis cost. Analyzers that are precise are usually also very slow,
while fast analyzers usually lack precision.</p>
<p>In contrast, Astrée is <em>parametric</em>, allowing you
to freely trade speed for precision and vice versa. The level
of abstraction used for analysis can be easily tailored to your
very own requirements.</p>
</li>
<li id="li16"><h4>Modular</h4>
<p>Astrée consists of several modules — 
so-called <i>abstract domains</i>. These modules can be assembled 
and parameterized to build application-specific analyzers that are 
fully adapted to a particular ap­plication domain or specific end-user
requirements.</p>
<p>In case of false alarms, Astrée can be easily extended by intro­duc­ing
additional modules that enhance the precision of the analysis.</p>
</li>
<li id="li17"><h4>Precise</h4>
<p>General-purpose static analyzers usually suffer from low precision in terms
of false alarms, i.e. spurious warnings about errors that can actu­ally never
occur at run­time. The ratio of false alarms to the number
of basic C operations typically ranges between 10% and 20%.</p>
<p>Specialized analyzers achieve a better precision of 10% or less. How­ever,
even a very high selectivity rate of only 1 false alarm for every 100 operations
is usually unacceptable for large real-world appli­cations. For example,
on a program with 100,000 operations, a selec­tivity rate of only 1% yields
1000 false alarms.</p>
<p>In contrast, thanks to its modularity and domain-awareness, Astrée
can be made <em>exceptionally precise</em>, often to the
point of pro­ducing exactly <em>zero false alarms</em>.
This has been repeatedly proven in indus­tri­al
practice, e.g. when analyzing primary flight-control software
for Airbus.</p>
</li>
<li id="li18"><h4>Up-to-date</h4>
<p>Astrée builds upon decades of research in static program analysis, 
and also makes sure to incorporate the latest ongoing research, always staying 
well ahead of any competition.</p>
