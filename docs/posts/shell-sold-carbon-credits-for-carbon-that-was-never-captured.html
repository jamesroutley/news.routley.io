The subsidy program ended in 2022. </p><p dir="ltr">During this period, Shell was able to sell 5.7 million tonnes of what Greenpeace describes as &#34;phantom&#34; credits, making more than $200 million for the company. These credits were sold to other oilsands companies on the Alberta carbon market, Greenpeace alleged.</p><p dir="ltr">Such sales would not have been illegal, but amounted to a &#34;hidden subsidy&#34; within the program which undercut the effectiveness of industrial carbon pricing, says Keith Stewart, senior energy strategist at Greenpeace and the author of the report.</p><p dir="ltr">&#34;Carbon capture projects that have been advertised as a solution to pollution in the oilsands have been almost entirely paid for by the public,&#34; he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Shell has received $777 million from the federal and provincial governments and $406 million in revenue from carbon offsets, according to company records cited by Greenpeace.</p><p dir="ltr">In all, taxpayer funding has covered 93 per cent of the costs of Shell&#39;s Quest project to date, Greenpeace said.</p><p dir="ltr">Since 2015, the Quest project has stored nine million tonnes of CO2. (By comparison, emissions from the oil and gas sector totalled just over <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-2024-national-inventory-report-2022-greenhouse-gas-emissions-1.7192042#:~:text=Alberta&#39;s%20emissions%20totalled%20270%20megatonnes,province&#39;s%20271%20megatonnes%20in%202021.">158 million tonnes</a> in 2022, the most recent federal data available.)</p><h2>&#39;Smear job&#39; </h2><p dir="ltr">Carbon offsets are bought and sold under a trading system, with governments putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions to compel companies to fight climate change.</p><p dir="ltr">Since 2007, Alberta has run a mandatory carbon offset system for large emitters, such as oil and gas companies. If they produce more than their allotted levels of carbon dioxide, they must purchase credits to offset those emissions.</p><div dir="ltr"><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Equipment and buildings at an oilsands mine" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5474405.1700862621!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/fort-hills-suncor.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5474405.1700862621!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/fort-hills-suncor.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5474405.1700862621!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/fort-hills-suncor.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5474405.1700862621!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/fort-hills-suncor.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5474405.1700862621!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/fort-hills-suncor.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5474405.1700862621!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/fort-hills-suncor.jpg" data-cy="image-img"/></p><figcaption>An oilsands mine in northern Alberta.

Stewart said he wants to make sure there aren&#39;t similar &#34;loopholes built into it in obscure ways that undercut the effectiveness of the policy.&#34;</p></div></div><div><h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2><div><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3502943.1669653259!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_300/benjamin-shingler.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3502943.1669653259!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_460/benjamin-shingler.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.3502943.1669653259!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_620/benjamin-shingler.jpg 620w" sizes="(max-width: 258pxpx) 258pxpx" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.3502943.1669653259!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/square_620/benjamin-shingler.jpg" data-cy="author-image-img"/></p></figure></div></div><p>Benjamin Shingler is a senior writer based in Montreal, covering climate policy, health and social issues.
