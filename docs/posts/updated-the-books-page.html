    <p>I love reading, sometimes in physical books and other times just on an eInk reader. I try to do the hip thing of shopping at <a href="https://www.mcnallyjackson.com/">local bookstores</a>, direct from <a href="https://versobooks.com">publishers I enjoy</a> and in general avoiding DRM locked e-books.</p>

<p>Anyways, here‚Äôs a list of books I‚Äôve particularly liked reading over the years:</p>

<h2 id="fiction">Fiction</h2>
<h3 id="ishmael-by-daniel-quinn"><em>Ishmael</em> by Daniel Quinn</h3>
<p>Topics: Philosophy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This book altered my thinking about the way modern society runs, specifically regarding our relationship with nature and resources. I really enjoyed the distinction between those who are <em>Takers</em> and those who are <em>Leavers</em>. The former make up our society as of the agricultural revolution, as we decided that the world and its resources should be ours for the taking. The latter are those who have lived alongside nature, being a member of its ranks rather than an external actor trying to conquer it to its desires.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="white-noise-by-don-delillo"><em>White Noise</em> by Don DeLillo</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>When one of my friends recommended this book, he told me ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt really read it for any plot; moreso the vibes.‚Äù I second his advice: approach this book with a mind open to absurdity and humor. You might like where it takes you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="another-now-by-yanis-varoufakis"><em>Another Now</em> by Yanis Varoufakis</h3>
<p>Topics: Economics, political fiction</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you enjoy <em>Talking To My Daughter About The Economy</em> this book is an excellent follow up. Varoufakis delivers his vision for a more democratic and just economic system via a scifi tale that keeps what may otherwise be a relatively dry subject quite interesting and fun to read.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="siddhartha-by-herman-hesse"><em>Siddhartha</em> by Herman Hesse</h3>
<p>Topics: Philosophy, religion</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of thoses books that I read in high school and hated at the time but thoroughly enjoyed reading as an adult.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-dispossessed-by-ursula-k-le-guin"><em>The Dispossessed</em> by Ursula K. Le Guin</h3>
<p>Topics: Political science fiction, anarchy</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before reading this book anytime I heard the word ‚Äúanarchy‚Äù I assumed somebody meant chaos, disorder, and violence. This book changed my perspective, providing a vision of what people who claim to be anarchists are actually striving for with their political ambitions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="on-the-beach-by-nevil-shute"><em>On The Beach</em> by Nevil Shute</h3>
<p>Topics: Nuclear post-apocalypse</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fuck this book to hell and back. I love this book. It is beautiful, terrifying, extremely well written, and deeply unsettling. Would highly recommend if you‚Äôre in the correct headspace for the genre.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="a-canticle-for-leibowitz-by-walter-m-miller-jr"><em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em> by Walter M. Miller Jr.</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The friend that recommended this book to me told me it was his all-time favorite, and that  I should simply take his word for it and start reading it without doing any research beforehand. I heeded this request and was rewarded handsomely for it; this is now also one of my all-time favorite books. I‚Äôd highly recommend following a similar strategy if you trust me üòÉ.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="non-fiction">Non-fiction</h2>

<h3 id="the-peoples-republic-of-walmart-by-leigh-phillips-and-michal-rozworski"><em>The People‚Äôs Republic of Walmart</em> by Leigh Phillips and Michal Rozworski</h3>
<p>Topics: Economics, planned economies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lays down the argument that economic planning is all around us, contrary to the popular orthodoxies that markets are the only way to allocate scarce resources. It provides a compelling case for coming up with democratic means of economic planning and expanding it throughout our economy rather than relying on the current mechanism of having private islands of authoritarianism linked together by profit-driven markets.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Topics: Economics, climate change.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal of this book is to fill a void of utopian thought in leftist literature around climate change. It paints a picture of what a more sustainable and just economic system could look like if it were centered around human and ecological goals rather than purely profit.</p>

  <p>A word of warning: I walked into this book thinking it would be fiction and quickly realized that two thirds are relatively dense academic analysis (mostly focusing on the viability of planned economies). If you‚Äôre interested in the topic I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs well worth the read, though if you just want to get the fictional utopian tl;dr you can probably just read through that one chapter and take in the socialist sights.</p>

<h3 id="the-master-switch-by-tim-wu"><em>The Master Switch</em> by Tim Wu</h3>
<p>Topics: American media, politics</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Evan Prodromou, one of the creators of the ActivityPub protocol, recommended this book on during <a href="https://prodromou.pub/@evan/109377112187459548">a discussion</a> of how Mastodon is currently a rare force of decentralization in a media platform. The book does a great job providing the history behind the cycles of centralization and decentralization of mediums in the past. I agree with Evan, the book is well worth your time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="talking-to-my-daughter-about-the-economy-by-yanis-varoufakis"><em>Talking To My Daughter About The Economy</em> by Yanis Varoufakis</h3>
<p>Topics: Economics</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Those who have read critiques of capitalism in the past may not learn many new details from this book, however the approachable way Yanis articulates economic concepts is incredibly powerful and novel. I think this book is worthwhile and entertaining for anybody to read- no matter their experience with economics.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bullshit-jobs-by-david-graeber"><em>Bullshit Jobs</em> by David Graeber</h3>
<p>Topics: Economics</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is it that, as we‚Äôve increased the amount of automation in our economy, we‚Äôre still working ourselves to death? This book gives some great arguments for why private enterprise doesn‚Äôt always offer the perfect efficiency advantages that its proponents claim.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="seeing-like-a-state-by-james-c-scott"><em>Seeing Like a State</em> by James C. Scott</h3>
<p>Topics: Politics, anarchism</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inspired my post on <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/2022/02/21/illegibility-digital-lives.html">illegibility in tech</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="homage-to-catalonia-by-george-orwell"><em>Homage to Catalonia</em> by George Orwell</h3>
<p>Topics: Spanish civil war, anarchism</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Very interesting to hear about the experiences that would serve as the foundation for Orwell‚Äôs later novels. Also fascinating to hear a first-hand account of a perceived period of classless society formed in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War.</p>

  <p>I should mention that catalonian friends of mine dispute the accuracy of this book, but I don‚Äôt know nearly enough about the history to write anything definitive here.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="busy-doing-nothing-by-rekka-bellum-and-devine-lu-linvega"><em>Busy Doing Nothing</em> by Rekka Bellum and Devine Lu Linvega</h3>
<p><a href="https://100r.co/site/busy_doing_nothing.html">Link to webpage</a>. Topics: Sailing, off-grid living, permacomputing, vegan cooking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A travelogue of two artists sailing across the Pacific Ocean from Japan to Vancouver. This book introduced me to <a href="https://100r.co">100 Rabbits</a> and the <a href="https://webring.xxiivv.com/">Merveilles webring</a>. and has since had a major impact on the way I think about technology‚Äôs place in the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="kitchen-confidential-by-anthony-bourdain"><em>Kitchen Confidential</em> by Anthony Bourdain</h3>
<p>Topics: Restaurants</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have even the slightest desire to open a restaurant you should probably read this book first.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="understanding-marxism-by-richard-d-wolff"><em>Understanding Marxism</em> by Richard D. Wolff</h3>
<p>Topics: Economics, Marxism</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A short (100 pgs) and very approachable introduction to the ideas behind Marxism. No matter how you feel about the topic, Marxist ideas have been highly influential and are worth learning a bit about.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-secret-life-of-groceries-by-benjamin-lorr"><em>The Secret Life of Groceries</em> by Benjamin Lorr</h3>
<p>Topics: Groceries, supply chains</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spend a lot of time in grocery stores, yet before reading this book I had very little understanding of how they worked. This book is a very cool dive into the underbelly of a system that you regularly interact with.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="the-breakdown-of-nations-by-leopold-kohr"><em>The Breakdown of Nations</em> by Leopold Kohr</h3>
<p>Topics: Political science, anarchism</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a nutshell, this book claims that the best way to prevent the abuse of power is to prevent its accumulation in the first place. The author argues that smaller nations make for a safer world.</p>
