There are differences in the immune systems between mice and humans, including our immunity being shaped by decades of infections.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>So the researchers are planning trials where one person is vaccinated and then deliberately infected to see how their body copes.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>There may also be consequences to dialling up the immune system beyond its normal state – raising questions of immune disorders.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said the work was undeniably &#34;exciting&#34; but cautioned &#34;we have to ensure that keeping the body on &#39;high alert&#39; doesn&#39;t lead to friendly fire, where a hyper-ready immune system accidentally triggers unwelcome side effects&#34;.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The research team in the US does not think the immune system should be permanently dialled up and think such a vaccine should be used to compliment rather than replace current vaccines.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>In the first stages of a pandemic, like early 2020 with Covid, a universal vaccine could buy time and save lives while a specialist vaccine was being developed.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>&#34;That would reduce mortality, disease severity, and perhaps build up a level of immune resilience that would have a huge impact,&#34; says Pulendran.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The other scenario is at the start of winter when the usual wide range of winter bugs start to spread, &#34;one could imagine a seasonal spray that could be administered to imprint broad immunity&#34; against them all.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><i id="correction-19-february:-this-story-was-updated-after-an-earlier-version-referred-to-edward-jenner-using-the-title-sir,-when-in-fact-he-was-never-knighted.">Correction 19 February: This story was updated after an earlier version referred to Edward Jenner using the title Sir, when in fact he was never knighted.</i></p></div></div></article></div>
