And then quickly, in one of my private communities, I had this question pop up:</span></p><blockquote><p>But how you would talk to your ideal customer if they are not the ones who try the product?</p><p>In my case -- I totally agree. CTOs / Director of Engineering are probably the ones who make decisions. But it is developers who try the product first.</p><p>In the article you talk about messaging. I get it. But how practically you can reach out to decision makers?</p></blockquote><p>Let’s dissect this question here and get to the root of this question here, right now.</p><p>This is the &#34;the user is not the buyer&#34; problem.</p><p>Sure, it&#39;s a tough one, and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a one-size-fits-all solution. </p><p><strong>Here’s the key… it depends on one thing:</strong><span> </span></p><p><span>→ Who actually has the power?</span></p><p>Let me explain…</p><p>Your product is used and bought by smaller companies, they have CTOs/directors, but it&#39;s pretty flat, and they are in build mode. These are likely early stage or smaller companies still trying to figure out their market fit or value proposition.</p><p>The user (developer) might have the power. Here’s why…</p><p>The CTO&#39;s incentive is to reduce time to market/iterate. The faster they are to market and iterate, the faster they learn, the faster they find PMF, the more likely everyone keeps their jobs (and maybe they get a big payout win 3-10 years from now, or at least that&#39;s the promise from the CEO).</p><p><span>The user/dev has the power </span><strong>because of the time constraint</strong><span>. </span></p><p>They&#39;re likely to come to the organization with knowledge - it&#39;s why they were hired. So, their suggestion on what to bring to the table in terms of dev tooling will be massively important. </p><p>They might even setup a free account to use before anyone notices, &#34;just to get things done&#34;. </p><p><span>Eventually they have to level up to a paid tier and voila, </span><strong>the company has just been trojan-horsed</strong><span>.</span></p><p>The CTO/directors/leadership are the ones who have the power because there’s different constraints other than time.  In this case, let’s just say security is the primary constraint. </p><p>No user/dev is going to be allowed to install software themselves. This comes from top-down. </p><p>Thus, the sales cycle is going to be long since you have to sell the value differently and there’s likely a vetting and due diligence type of process they have to go through to choose your product over another.</p><p>The users/devs don&#39;t have much of a choice because the primary value/risk isn&#39;t UI/UX/DX or whatever the user/dev cares about. It&#39;s security + outcome/output.</p><p><strong>Now here’s the thing…</strong><span> The person with the credit card is who we typically would call the &#34;decision maker&#34; (and in the original question, it was called the “ideal customer” even).</span></p><p><strong>But the reality is, they aren&#39;t always the one with the power. It depends on the constraints they&#39;re under.</strong></p><p>It&#39;s also not “who tries the product first”, as the original question states. </p><p>It&#39;s “who has the leverage”?</p><p>Who has the power, the constraints, and/or the incentive to push it through the most?</p><p><span>Subsequently, </span><strong>this is who values it the most.</strong></p><p>IMPORTANT POINT: I’m getting picky about defining “value” here. It needs to be actionable - something within the bounds of reality. Someone who says it’s worth N to them, but doesn’t have the means to actually trade N for it, doesn’t really matter at the end of the day. </p><p>Let’s get back to it…</p><p><strong>If your user/dev values it more than the holder of the budget, then you only have one thing to do….</strong></p><p>The CTO will never write the check for the value the user/dev deems it’s worth.  </p><p>That said, as a dev, I&#39;ve paid for tools out of my own pocket that mean enough to me to do so if it&#39;s valuable enough. And in that case, the incentive and value isn&#39;t because the company will win... it&#39;s because I&#39;m going to look great when I make the company win.</p><p><span>Different incentives. </span></p><p>But, with that in mind, let&#39;s get more specific... </p><p><span>I posed this question back to the OP: “What&#39;s the typical path for adoption (that works best for you!)?”</span></p><ol><li><p>User/dev registers</p></li><li><p>User/dev runs free trial on a local environment</p></li><li><p>User/dev gets a the value right before the do a pull request, so they can see the before and after scenarios (highlighting any issues)</p></li><li><p><span>User/dev sees value (Note: here’s </span><a href="https://writings.founderlabs.io/p/how-to-increase-mrr-activating-users?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">how to master the “aha moment”</a><span>). They see it will save them time with QA’ing their own changes, perhaps it could even be automated?</span></p></li><li><p>User/dev tries to convince leadership it&#39;s necessary to get it paid for</p></li><li><p>Leadership tests/sees process, checks budget, decides yes/no</p></li><li><p>Leadership gives approval for purchase</p></li><li><p>User/dev/leadership purchases</p></li><li><p>User/dev continues to use it and propagates among other user/devs in the co.</p></li></ol><p><span>In this case (change based on the assumption of the scenarios above, small vs big orgs, user flow, etc), </span><strong>here&#39;s some questions to figure out:</strong></p><p><strong>What&#39;s the real incentive behind why the dev suggests the tool?</strong><span>  Does the dev want it because it helps them be awesome / reduces the pain of doing their job, or because it&#39;ll help the company goals? </span></p><p><strong>What&#39;s the real incentive behind why the leadership buys it?</strong><span> Because they&#39;ll see it&#39;ll take less time for the dev to do their job, they&#39;ll be better at it, thus getting to the goals of the company? </span></p><p>If those things are true, I would do these 2 things….</p><ol><li><p>Give the user/dev the tools they need to convince their leadership that it&#39;s a slam dunk (for their incentives).  Translate the value from the user/dev’s terms into the leadership’s terms.  </p></li></ol><p>Note: It&#39;s best if this isn&#39;t explicitly declared to them like &#34;here&#39;s how you convince your leadership this is a good idea&#34; but more like &#34;here&#39;s a report showing how much time you were going to spend doing it in the old way vs how much time you actually spent doing it this way&#34;. Also, make these actual, real numbers as much as possible or the dev won&#39;t use the report because they’ll know the numbers are inaccurate.</p><ol start="2"><li><p>I&#39;d also do some customer interviews here with the devs to figure out how those conversations usually go with leadership.  What do they need to make that conversation go faster/easier? What stops them from buying?</p></li></ol><p><strong>Find the friction, smooth it out.</strong></p><p>The meta point here is that you&#39;re not going to talk to the credit card holder; the user/dev is going to do that for you. </p><p><span>Give them the best possible chance at convincing the leadership. Make them look awesome for even bothering the leadership with a choice like this. Make it obviously awesome for them to decide “yes”.  These users/devs are your sales people. Treat them as such in the sense that </span><strong>if they win</strong><span> (product does what the user hopes and dreams it will, getting them to the promised land), </span><strong>you win</strong><span> ($), and </span><strong>then they win again</strong><span> (look good, systemically removing friction in their job/process, etc). Not to mention, the leadership wins and the company wins.</span></p><p>Now go, and proselytize those devs. ;) </p><p><span>If you’re a founder who wants to get unstuck, reduce churn, get through that revenue plateau, generate more leads, and more…  </span><a href="https://fantastical.app/nateritter/nrp" rel="">Get in touch today</a></p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://fantastical.app/nateritter/nrp&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;→ I want to get unstuck, let&#39;s talk&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:&#34;button-wrapper&#34;}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://fantastical.app/nateritter/nrp" rel=""><span>→ I want to get unstuck, let&#39;s talk</span></a></p><p><span>🧢 Hat tip to </span><a href="https://ygerasimov.com" rel="">Yuriy Gerasimov</a><span> from </span><a href="https://diffy.website" rel="">Diffy (visual regression for Wordpress and Drupal)</a><span> for the being the muse this week!
