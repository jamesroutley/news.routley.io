				<h4>ðŸ¥¾ The game is afoot!</h4>

				<p>To unravel this intricate puzzle, you&#39;ll be presented with a series of clues that gradually
					unveil the truth behind the murder. Keep in mind that <strong>the suspects won&#39;t dare lie</strong>
					to avoid being charged with obstruction of justice,
					but <strong>they will be cautious about divulging anything excessively incriminating</strong>.</p>

				<p>However, it&#39;s important to note that <strong>every clue you view will have an impact on your overall
						score</strong>.
					Exercise caution and strategic thinking as you navigate through the evidence and interrogate
					the suspects to piece together the ultimate solution.</p>
