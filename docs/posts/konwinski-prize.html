<p>Last night, I <a href="https://x.com/andykonwinski/status/1867015050403385674">tweeted</a> on stage at NeurIPS that I’ll give $1M to the open source AI that breaks 90% on a sweet new version of my favorite benchmark, <a href="http://swebench.com">SWE-bench</a>. The competition is called the <a href="http://kprize.ai">K Prize</a>!</p>

<p>The K Prize aims to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Measure how AI coders perform when they can’t cheat</li>
  <li>Model a better way to benchmark</li>
  <li>Move AI forward in the open</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why SWE-bench?</strong> Well, I fell in love with SWE-bench the moment I saw it. What a great idea: have AI solve real issues from popular GitHub repos. I love that SWE-bench is hard, built from real world data, and measures something that I care about (coding).</p>

<p><strong>Why make a contamination free version?</strong> SWE-bench publishes its test set. This allows leaderboard submissions to train on the test data. Even if SWE-bench didn’t officially publish the test set, the benchmark is composed of issues and code scraped from public GitHub repos, and most models today are trained extensively on those same repositories, so contamination is a likely happening. I’ve always wondered how the leaderboard would change if the test set weren’t public. That’s why I decided to build a contamination-free version of SWE-bench.</p>

<p><strong>Why open source code and open weight models only?</strong> I am passionate about open source. One of the things I love most about open source is how it taps into a bigger community energy - individuals building off the work of other individuals. I love that feeling of getting swept up into something much bigger than yourself. That moment when you look at your team and say, “whoa, are we actually doing this?” That’s how I felt when I was working on Apache Spark at Berkeley, and that’s how I hope those who work on the K Prize will feel.</p>

<p><strong>Why a competition?</strong> I came to appreciate the power of programming competitions to catalyze research progress back at UC Berkeley, where I witnessed the Netflix Prize (which was also $1M and based on real data) inspire my friend and Databricks co-founder Matei Zaharia to create Apache Spark. Not to mention, I love competitive programming myself. And in my experience picking co-founders, competitive programmers make some of the best - Matei and my Perplexity co-founder Johnny Ho were both some of the best ranked in the world.</p>

<p>One day in early 2024 I had the idea to put all of the above together and the K Prize was born! I assembled a team to adapt SWE-bench’s collection pipeline and implement the evaluation part on Kaggle’s infrastructure. For this competition we will collect a new test set after the submission deadline.</p>

<p>And finally, shoutouts to the core members of the K Prize team for standing this up: Chris Rytting, Justin Fiedler, Alex Shaw, K. Tighe, and Lindsey Gregory. Thanks to our creative team for making it cool: Jennifer DeVoid on dev, Richard McClellan on design, and Travis Nichols on Dr. K (aka cartoon me). Also thanks to Kaggle for their deep partnership. Finally, thanks to John Yang and Carlos E. Jimenez (the creators of SWE-bench) for their advice and help as we built the collection pipeline for contamination-free SWE-bench.</p>

<p>Happy hacking!</p>
