    <h1>Why do people leave comments on OpenBenches?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
					<p>I&#39;m still a believer in the promise of Web 2.0. The idea that giving people a curated space to chat produces tiny sparks of magic.</p>
					<p>My wife Liz and I have been running the <a href="https://openbenches.org">OpenBenches project</a> for about 8 years - it&#39;s a crowd-sourced repository of memorial benches. People take a geotagged photo of a bench&#39;s plaque, upload it to our site, and we share it with the world.  Might sound a bit niche, but we have around thirty-nine <em>thousand</em> benches catalogued from all over the world.</p>
					<p>From the start, we had a comment form under each bench. Of course, we pre-moderate any comments. That <a href="https://www.openbenches.org/blog/online-safety-act/">helps with our Online Safety Act obligations</a> and prevents spam from being published. We don&#39;t collect any personal data, to reduce our GDPR exposure. Our comments are self-hosted using the excellent <a href="https://commentics.com/">Commentics</a> - which means we don&#39;t send people&#39;s data off to a 3rd party.</p>
					<p>We <em>thought</em> that this would be used to tell us that an inscription was wrong, or if a bench had moved, or something like that.</p>
					<p>We were completely wrong!</p>
					<p>People use OpenBenches comments for all sorts of things. Of course, there are a few which provide details about the bench itself:</p>
					<p><a href="https://openbenches.org/bench/33640"><img alt="This bench was removed after the river flooded and majorly eroded the bank earlier this year (spring 2025), and now two new benches are in approximately the same place but a little further back from the river." height="402" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/removed.webp" width="1248"/></a></p>
					<p>Other provide a little context about the person:
<a href="https://openbenches.org/bench/38738"><img alt="
She competed under her birth name, Zsuzsa Nádor:

There&#39;s a Wikipedia article about Roman, too:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Halter" height="402" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/info.webp" width="1248"/></a></p>
					<p>But those sorts of comments are hardly the majority.  The comments break down (roughly) into these categories:</p>
