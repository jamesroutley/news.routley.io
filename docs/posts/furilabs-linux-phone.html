	<div><p>This phone isn’t ready YET to hand to grandma and say “Use this!”. But I think it’s quickly heading in that direction. The amount of progress the dev team has made on it in the past month and a half has been an incredible journey. I bought this not knowing if the phone would work or not, as I had never heard of Furilabs… But I took the chance and ordered one on July 19, 2024.</p>
<p>When I first got it, I found out that the phone didn’t work at all in the USA. It would display a 2G or 2.75G symbol, but wouldn’t make calls or browse the web, as it didn’t have support for US cellular bands, only Europe and the rest of the world. I offered to give SSH access to my device to one of the developers, and have been letting him test modem builds on my device with a Ting MVNO Sim. At first it seemed kind of unbelievable that it would work and I’ll be honest, I also wasn’t confident in the developers to get it working. I’m glad I did though, because as of today the latest modem build the developer has put on the device has allowed me to place and receive calls, and browse the web on 4G LTE. 5G doesn’t work yet, and only band 4 of 4G LTE is enabled currently on the test build I’m running, but I can use the phone now!</p>
<p>I will continue to offer my device to run test builds, and I’m excited to see the progress. The phone’s software is extremely liberating compared to android. It’s fast, it runs a familiar debian-based Linux environment, and it already has some really unique features I have been wanting in a phone! For example, there is a button on the left side of the phone that you can program from within the settings to run shell scripts, take screenshots, open the camera or take pictures, and toggle the flashlight. This is the first Linux phone I’ve had with such a feature, and I think it’s a fantastic addition.</p>
<p>With my thoughts on the camera, it takes great quality pictures, and even records video! It might sound odd I am counting recording video as a feature, but other Linux phones like the PinePhone and Librem 5 do not support video recording with the camera, unless you use hacky scripts. Aside from that it’s fully water resistant, has a removable microSD slot, dual sim capability (at least in hardware, as currently that’s not enabled in software), a LED indicator for notifications, a fully working fingerprint sensor (as in you can enroll each finger on your hand and use it to login to the phone – at least after you login once from a cold boot with your pin or password), full disk encryption, Android app support with Waydroid (but amped up as it supports the phone’s sensors and GPS and runs android apps as if they’re native apps), and volume toggle in the accesibility settings menu that lets you set the speaker volume to 150%.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why you wouldn’t just buy a PinePhone, Librem 5, or a phone that can run Ubuntu Touch instead of this device. My answer to that is that the FLX1 while yes, it does use Halium, has far better support than a typical Ubuntu Touch or Droidian capable device. The developers involved with the project have been involved with the Droidian project, and are the one of very people who did a lot of the work to get good Waydroid integration on those systems originally. With the FLX1 they’re amping it up even more, with further improvements, fixes, and features that other devices haven’t seen and probably won’t. A big one for me being VoLTE and VoNR support, something even the mature Ubuntu Touch project still doesn’t have publicly available. To my knowledge, this is the first Linux phone that has 5G fully working, and notably 4G VoLTE working globally with hopefully soon to follow global 5G VoNR support. As I’ve said, the US band support for the rest of the 4G range and 5G is still something that they’re working on, and I hope to soon report progress on that front. Very exciting!</p>
<p>There’s tons of additional settings to dive into, such as USB settings for MTP, USB state, CD-ROM settings, a NFC support toggle, GPS SUPL server setting you can set to a custom server URL, a printer setting panel for adding and managing printers, and a slew of accesibility and privacy/security settings such as controlling screen lock, location access, file history, camera access, and more. Some of those things have already existed in phosh, but a number of them have been enabled or modified, offering things you don’t usually get on mobile Linux. A quick note on the Waydroid settings, it has a full panel for controlling starting/stopping of android apps, clearing app data, as well as controlling NFC access to Waydroid and enabling a shared folder. It also gives you the IP of the Android container and gives you information on the Android version running in the container. The developers have mentioned to me that they have big plans to rework phosh to be a bit cleaner, add more fine grained controls and settings, and add features such as RCS support for messaging and context-aware text suggestions in the phosh keyboard. </p>
<p>With that said, the new features like RCS likely won’t arrive for a bit as they have the cellular stuff to sort, as well as some bug fixes and other features they want to polish first. The device does have some bugs in Firefox and with video acceleration in video players such as MPV, and I’ve personally noticed that compass bearing in Waydroid is currently bugged although GPS itself does work otherwise. That alongside the fact that 4G LTE band support is currently limited to Band 4 in the USA means that I realize this phone isn’t currently for everyone, but I think it’s important to note that the developers are incredibly active on telegram and respond immediately to problems you might have. There has only been one device so far, to the best of my knowledge, that was defective from the manufacturer they use, but Furilabs was quick to replace it and apologize to the person for the inconvience. I believe they even overnighted it to him before taking a look at the device to see what hardware had failed.</p>
<p>The device has a fantastic custom recovery system. You can SSH in to copy files or try to fix a software issue, and it has a factory reset system to easily roll back to the original software, or you could even reflash the phone completely using a computer. Another big thing to note is that the developers also are on a roll at releasing bug fixes and offering workarounds for issues. Infact, they’re currently testing a new software release in their beta-tester telegram channel with a couple of volunteers to see if there’s any bugs that may have slipped through before release. Currently they aim to release a new update every month, and they release the full changelog on their website for everyone to see. When I asked about automated testing, one of the developers mentioned they would like to get to implementing that when they get a chance. </p>
<p>I highly recommend you take a look at the changelogs, web forum, and telegram as there’s tons of awesome information available. Not just to mention the fact that the phone is open source, with source code avaialable on github for everything except the modem and some of the recovery I believe (Which has intulectual property bits that mediatek wouldn’t be happy to have public). It’s not perfect right now, but nothing is perfect, let’s be real! What it is however, is incredibly promising. I’ve never had more hope in a Linux phone than this one. I’ve gotten up at 6AM some days to excitedly work with the developer to test out new modem firmware because it’s been a steady march of improvements each day, and that’s just the modem! I am highly confident within the next month, mauybe two, that this device is something I will be able to give to my mother to use.</p>
<p>With the open source stack, and the GTK framework powering applications, Android app support in a pinch, a powerful Debian-based stack with a proper Linux terminal and libraries, bash scripting, and powerful hardware, it has a lot to offer. I will update this review as it progresses to add more information and expand on where the software stands as it improves, but while this phone isn’t for everyone just year, I hope some of you reading this might be willing to pull the trigger and support the project by grabbing one of these, and my reasoning is simple: In order to survive and continue to improve on the device, Furilabs is going to need money coming in from sales. This is a small company, and every little thing will count. I’ve never had more hope for a Linux phone project than this one, and I’ve tussled with a lot over the years. And I’m sure if you’re interested you can reach out on the Telegram to maybe test out the latest modem builds for USA support and get it polished up quicker!</p>

	<div><p>From iPhone to Furiphone</p>
<p>I bought this phone because I care about my data and personal privacy. I didn’t realize that such a phone would radically alter my relationship to my phone: they could have just called it a “myPhone” because the phone (not to mention your data) belong to YOU. It feels like having something unique and that is YOURS in your pocket, which is an experience that I didn’t even realize was possible until getting it. You can also tell that the development team has made this a labor of LOVE. It is always a pleasure being able to talk to them about the phone and feel like you’re helping to develop a piece of linux history. (The first fully functional linux phone!)</p>
<p>You can install all the linux apps you want, while having access to all traditional apps through the excellent waydroid service installed on the phone. The phone is accessible through terminal on my computer and it has been great using a familiar interface to install apps and manage files. The latest updates are always something to look forward to, making the phone better and better with each iteration. The camera app runs buttery smooth and takes excellent pictures, and hard as it is to believe there will only be more improvements!</p>
<p>I was an iPhone user before and find myself missing the iOS ecosystem very little with this phone. It has all the apps and features that I need, they run well, and delivers a personal experience with great technical support staff available to talk about any problems that you have. It does a lot of things better than my iPhone, like provide instant access to all my folders and files on other devices through setting up a single app like Syncthing.</p>
<p>If you love Linux, having your own experience with technology and a great community attached to it, then you will love this phone. It’s worth it even beyond the added privacy and peace of mind that only linux can afford. So what are you waiting for? Go out and BUY your own now!</p>
