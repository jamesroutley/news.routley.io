<h2>Use of ChatGPT generated text for posts on Stack Overflow is temporarily banned.</h2>
<p>This is a temporary policy intended to slow down the influx of answers created with ChatGPT. What the final policy will be regarding the use of this and other similar tools is something that will need to be discussed with Stack Overflow staff and, quite likely, here on Meta Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>Overall, because the average rate of getting <em>correct</em> answers from ChatGPT is too low, the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is <em>substantially harmful</em> to the site and to users who are asking or looking for <em>correct</em> answers.</p>
<p>The primary problem is that while the answers which ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically <em>look like</em> they <em>might</em> be good and the answers are <em>very</em> easy to produce. There are also many people trying out ChatGPT to create answers, without the expertise or willingness to verify that the answer is correct prior to posting. Because such answers are so easy to produce, a large number of people are posting a <em>lot</em> of answers. The volume of these answers (thousands) and the fact that the answers often require a detailed read by someone with at least some subject matter expertise in order to determine that the answer is actually bad has effectively swamped our volunteer-based quality curation infrastructure.</p>
<p>As such, we need the volume of these posts to reduce and we need to be able to deal with the ones which are posted quickly, which means dealing with users, rather than individual posts. So, for now, the use of ChatGPT to create posts here on Stack Overflow is not permitted. If a user is believed to have used ChatGPT after this temporary policy is posted, sanctions will be imposed to prevent users from continuing to post such content, even if the posts would otherwise be acceptable.</p>
