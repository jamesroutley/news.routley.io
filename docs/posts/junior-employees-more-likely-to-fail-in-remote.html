    <h1>Junior employees more likely to fail in remote</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, we casually polled the internet on this question:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fda3048302e579473bfb454/62b4a4a22015ea5b728c818c_reddit%20poll%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fda3048302e579473bfb454/62b4a4fe6cfdf1240b9b0bc0_LI%20poll3%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Casual polls on reddit and LinkedIn.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, say what you will about the nature of the question, the implicit bias contained within, and the fact there should be an &#34;option 3&#34; as a couple commenters pointed out. But as far as a quick gut-check goes, these results validate a hunch I had, one I&#39;ve discussed with colleagues at Slite and other remote companies. </p><p><em>Remote companies generally don&#39;t set up junior employees for success.</em></p><h2>Why junior employees are more likely to fail in remote</h2><p>It&#39;s <em>really</em> expensive to hire a junior employee just to set them up to fail. We have to assume it&#39;s not intentional. </p><p>First off, certain personalities thrive in remote. We&#39;ve discussed this in a <a href="https://slite.com/blog/async-for-everyone">previous blog</a>:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fda3048302e579473bfb454/629a238dd70ac605a9f21592_Diagram.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Team members in an async company need to be doers, drivers, and promoters of their own work.</figcaption></figure><p>If a new hire has these qualities naturally, or arrives on Day One having already adopted good remote habits, they will be in a better position than someone who is still learning how to work in a team, via screens and at a distance. </p><p>Training and upskilling junior employees in remote is not impossible, but it is more challenging than IRL. </p><p>Here&#39;s a quick rundown of why:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fda3048302e579473bfb454/62b4a2068b0534c434e6235a_Junior%20employees%20chart%201.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>As you can see, junior remote employees are doing almost 2x the upskilling they&#39;re doing in the office. It&#39;s not their fault they are struggling to get up to speed as quickly. </p><p>But managers, who are under pressure to meet their own goals as well as their new hire&#39;s, are impatient about wanting to see impact, immediately. They also have worked remotely for a while and are used to doing, driving, and promoting their own work. There&#39;s little empathy for someone who needs to be shown the ropes, and frustration with someone constantly pinging them with questions. </p><p>But there are incremental and easy ways to build good remote habits from scratch.</p><h2>Micromanagement vs. micro-tasks</h2><p>Micromanagement gets a bad rap. But maybe we&#39;re just thinking about it in the wrong way. Breaking down tasks into tiny chunks is actually a really helpful way for newer employees to get reassurance, build confidence, and learn accountability. For managers, this incremental approach creates guardrails for the project itself, and eventually creates a path for off-ramping the new team member.</p><h3>Example: engineering intern</h3><p>One of the developers at Slite has been working with an intern. Here&#39;s his quite simple recipe for building up to bigger tasks:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>First, they start on training exercises, unrelated to the product work, where the junior developer learns our technologies and workflows</li><li>Then, they move on to easy bug fixes / small wording changes to make, so they can focus on learning the workflows</li><li>Then, they follow the same process as any other dev when faced with a daunting task: breaking down and splitting up big challenges. </li></ol><p>This last part boils down to a roadmap made of &#34;manageable, but valuable&#34; delivery steps. </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Manageable</strong> - you can wrap your head about the goal and find a comprehensive path towards shipping it. Anything longer than a week is a no-go.</li><li><strong>Valuable</strong> - will have a provable impact on growth</li></ul><p>Eventually, junior employees will start to operate more independently, and also learn how to carry their weight as a contributor to a team.</p><p>Of course, we recommend using Slite docs and Discussions for planning your roadmap and communicating along the way (Sorry, had to). </p><h2>Why you should be empathetic and open to junior hires</h2><p>This generation is facing unprecedented socio-historical challenges.</p><p>Job insecurity has been on the rise since the 2001 recession, and increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some Gen-Z workers were born into a recession and are now graduating into one. There&#39;s increased competition for jobs and less margin for error. Remote work candidates are competing in a global pool as opposed to a local market. Junior hires can&#39;t afford to be young and foolish and inexperienced. </p><p>It&#39;s a common, and frustrating conundrum:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5fda3048302e579473bfb454/62b4a0e09e41296c0a2206f2_4f2.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Adjustment from school or home to the working world is not a natural process, especially after a 3-year pandemic. Senior employees can&#39;t relate.</p><p>But the hesitation makes sense: junior employees need more oversight, more human interaction, more guidance, more socialization and more confidence-building than senior operators. Of course it&#39;s really hard to manage these interpersonal subtleties from afar. </p><p>But a lot of so-called &#34;work experience&#34; is just getting used to a professional environment, and that really doesn&#39;t take too long. If you care about employee retention and securing the future of your company, it&#39;s worth it.</p><h2>How remote leaders can support junior employees</h2><ul role="list"><li>New hires need to join a stable squad, where senior team members can take time to onboard and support them</li><li>Limit the number of junior employees to a certain % of your workforce: sounds harsh, but in a remote team, especially a startup, resources are limited. Don&#39;t stretch managers too thin.</li><li>Set clear, documented expectations for what the junior employee will achieve in their first month, six months, and year. </li><li>Provide coaching and/or therapy services, such as Oliva</li><li>Encourage junior hires to build relationships and community by meeting with colleagues in their region, joining a coworking space, and attending local networking events </li></ul><h2>Junior hires are the future</h2><p>Junior hires are the future of your company, plain and simple. They bring skills and knowledge that you aren&#39;t even aware you need yet. Investing in them is a long play.</p><p>But unless you&#39;ve built mentorship into your business model, they will fail. With the right management model in place, you&#39;ll build a structured process for junior hires to flourish on their own and a pipeline of talent for your company&#39;s future.</p></div></div>
