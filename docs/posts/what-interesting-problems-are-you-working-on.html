    <h1>Ask HN: What interesting problems are you working on?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>This is a follow up of this thread ( <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22174828" rel="nofollow">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22174828</a> ) which got some amazing responses but considering it&#39;s been almost two years, It&#39;s time for new edition<p>I&#39;d love to hear about what interesting problems (technically or otherwise) you&#39;re working on -- and if you&#39;re willing to share more, I&#39;m curious how you ended up working on them. This time, with a twist. Please include web technologies too if it&#39;s really niche and not a lot of people know about it</p></div></div>
