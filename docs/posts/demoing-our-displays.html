<p>If you&#39;re new to displays, some of the terms mentioned above (e.g. &#34;dots&#34;, &#34;pixel configuration&#34;, &#34;pixel pitch&#34;) might need clarification:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pixels vs. dots.</strong> Dots (also known as &#34;subpixels&#34;) are single-color subregions of a pixel. Depending upon the pixel configuration of the display, dots can show up as small lines or small circles assembled into various patterns (e.g. vertically aligned lines, staggered circles, etc).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/george.w.singer/business/png/dots_vs_pixels.png" alt=""/></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Pixel configuration.</strong> Pixel configuration (or &#34;pixel geometry&#34;) refers to how the dots in a display are patterned.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/george.w.singer/business/png/pixel_geometries.png" alt=""/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Pixel pitch.</strong> Pixel pitch measures the distance between pixels (or between dots of the same color) on a display.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/george.w.singer/business/png/pixel_pitch.png" alt=""/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p><strong>Computing the number of colors.</strong> The number of colors displayable is determined by the bytes allocated per pixel. In our case each pixel has <code>3</code> dots (R+G+B), and each dot has <code>8</code> bits (or <code>1</code> byte). Hence each dot can encode <code>2^8 = 256</code> distinct color values. Since there are <code>3</code> dots per pixel, each pixel is then capable of displaying up to <code>256^3 = 16,777,216</code> distinct colors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Response time (BtW).</strong> Response time measures how long it takes for a pixel to change colors (in this case: from black to white). This serves as a proxy for how long it will take for a display to draw a new image after it receives a new draw. Low response times are crucial for responsive VR, while high response times can cause disorientation or motion sickness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>NTSC Color Gamut.</strong> The NTSC color gamut denotes a subset of the visible color spectrum which displays can benchmark against. In our case: our displays are capable of showing colors from 83% of the NTSC gamut.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<!-- 7. **Typical brightness.** Brightness is measured in "nits" (or `cd/m^2` aka "candela per square meter"). In our case a Typical Brightness of 150 nits means that our display has the equivalent light power of 150 candles lighting a square meter of space. -->

<p>The process of connecting a Desktop PC to a display is pretty straightforward: simply connect them together with an HDMI or DisplayPort cable. However, panels are rarely driven directly by DisplayPort. </p>
<ol>
<li>Each of our two VR Displays expects to be connected via the <a href="https://www.mipi.org/specifications/dsi">MIPI-DSI</a> Serial Interface (a pretty common standard for mobile &amp; VR displays).</li>
<li>The CPU in our compute pack only provides a single MIPI-DSI port, but we need two!</li>
<li>Desktop PCs do not support MIPI outputs, so you wouldn&#39;t be able to use the displays in tethered mode</li>
</ol>
<p>Our solution to (1)-(3) is to split up a single outgoing stream of DisplayPort data into two MIPI-DSI lanes, via a <a href="https://www.synaptics.com/company/news/virtual-reality-DDIC">VXR7200 Dual MIPI VR Bridge</a>.  With two MIPI-DSI streams, we are then able to connect them to each of our VR displays.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what the VXR7200 looks like (using an evaluation board):</p>
<p><img src="https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/george.w.singer/business/png/VXR7200_evaluation_board.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>The overall connection setup can be visualized roughly as follows:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/george.w.singer/business/png/display_diagram.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://www.mipi.org/specifications/d-phy">D-PHY interface</a> connecting the bridge to each of the displays is a type of a MIPI interface.</p>

<p>Putting this all together: below is a video of our compute unit routing video data through the VXR7200 bridge to our displays:</p>

<p>Note that the images in our VR displays still need to be distorted for them to look correct when viewed through our lenses (<a href="https://simulavr.com/blog/camera-considerations/">details discussed here</a>). This distortion will be handled through a library called <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/monado/monado">monado</a>, which is an open-source implementation of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenXR">OpenXR</a> runtime. We will explain these issues in more detail in a future post.</p>
