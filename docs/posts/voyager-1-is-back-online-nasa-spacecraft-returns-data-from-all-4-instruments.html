<p>All right, everyone — we can all breathe a sigh of relief. NASA&#39;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/17688-voyager-1.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/17688-voyager-1.html"><u>Voyager 1</u></a> spacecraft is fully operational once more, with all four science instruments returning usable data to Earth.</p><p>The problems began in November 2023, when Voyager 1 lost its ability to &#34;speak&#34; with us. More specifically, it started sending to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/54-earth-history-composition-and-atmosphere.html"><u>Earth</u></a> unintelligible data instead of its normal 0s and 1s of binary code. Of course, Voyager 1 is 46 years old — ancient for a spacecraft — so it wasn&#39;t <em>entirely</em> a surprise that its health might be waning. And that&#39;s not to mention that it&#39;s in entirely uncharted interstellar territory, some 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) from Earth. </p><p>Voyager 1&#39;s dogged team was determined to not only figure out what went wrong, but also to fix the problem. And they&#39;ve succeeded! Controllers identified where the issue was located: the flight data subsystem (FDS), used to &#34;package&#34; data to be sent to Earth. Further sleuthing revealed the exact chip causing the problem, which allowed them to find a workaround. After the team relocated the code to a new location in the FDS, Voyager 1 finally sent back intelligible data on April 20, 2024 — but only from two of its four science instruments. Now, just two months later, Voyager 1&#39;s remaining two science instruments are back up and running, communicating effectively with mission control on Earth.</p><p>Even if Voyager 1 had gone dark for good, however, the mission would still have been a wild success. After it launched in 1977, its primary mission was to study <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/7-jupiter-largest-planet-solar-system.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/7-jupiter-largest-planet-solar-system.html"><u>Jupiter</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/48-saturn-the-solar-systems-major-ring-bearer.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/48-saturn-the-solar-systems-major-ring-bearer.html"><u>Saturn</u></a> — that was accomplished by 1980. (Its twin spacecraft, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/voyager-2" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/voyager-2"><u>Voyager 2</u></a>, went on to study <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/45-uranus-seventh-planet-in-earths-solar-system-was-first-discovered-planet.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/45-uranus-seventh-planet-in-earths-solar-system-was-first-discovered-planet.html"><u>Uranus</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/41-neptune-the-other-blue-planet-in-our-solar-system.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/41-neptune-the-other-blue-planet-in-our-solar-system.html"><u>Neptune</u></a>.) But Voyager 1 is on an unstoppable path. Continuing its journey away from Earth, the spacecraft entered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/interstellar-space-definition-explanation" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/interstellar-space-definition-explanation"><u>interstellar space</u></a> in 2012, returning crucial data about this mysterious realm.</p><p>Now that Voyager 1 is back online, the team will continue to &#34;touch up&#34; the spacecraft to get it back in top form, including resynchronizing its timekeeping software to execute commands at the right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/time-how-it-works" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.space.com/time-how-it-works"><u>time</u></a>, as well as performing maintenance on the digital tape recorder that measures plasma waves. And hopefully, Voyager 1 will have a long, happy life ahead.</p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-zXjotydkMTeij63e2Mmbt7"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!</p></section></div></div></div>
