While it’s possible that Heege may have scribbled down the text during an actual live performance, the study concludes that it’s more likely he copied them from a repertoire manuscript that served as a minstrel’s setlist.</p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Scholars have more-or-less given up on any hope of finding medieval manuscripts that we can confidently claim to have been made or used by actual medieval minstrels. My essay does not contest that,” Wade said. “Instead, it suggests that we might look to other kinds of sources for glimpses of live performance, or minstrelsy, from the Middle Ages. These sources will be more mediated and less mobile, but for all that no less a valuable witness to live entertainment culture.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The Heege Manuscript is a well-studied collection of booklets that was assembled by various scribes, including Heege, who probably copied the trio of texts included in the first booklet around 1480. This booklet, which is utterly unique, records a rhyme called “The Hunting of the Hare,” a satirical version of a sermon, and a nonsense verse called “The Battle of Brackonwet&#39;&#39; that includes Heege’s note about lacking a drink at the feast.  </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>As Wade delved into the origins and context cues in these three texts, he discovered a host of clues that Heege may have copied them from a minstrel’s memory aid. In this way, the booklet may preserve an unprecedented, if indirect, record of a minstrel’s act.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“All three texts survive only in this booklet,” Wade noted in his study. “All three are composed in forms suited to and conventionally aligned with live performance (tail-rhyme, prose sermon, feast meta-comedy). All three are short enough to be suitable for interludes or after-dinner entertainment. All three contain ‘minstrel tags’ and otherwise directly address and anticipate a live and interactive audience. All three are entertaining and light-heartedly humorous.” </p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“All three are locally oriented, using local place-names, alluding to local traditions, or situating narratives in the context of present or neighboring villages,” he continued. “And finally, all three (gently) mock peasants and kings alike, and show a playful awareness of possible mixed audiences, or the possibility of audiences shifting depending on location, from the village fair to the baronial hall.”</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>This list of attributes will be familiar to any touring band or comedian that incorporates banter about regional rivalries and local legends into their act to appeal to different audiences. For instance, “The Battle of Brackonwet&#39;&#39; weaves in references to real villages near the Derbyshire-Nottinghamshire border even as it recounts absurd episodes involving Robin Hood, jousting bears, and partying pigs. You can almost imagine the delight of hometown crowds as they heard their familiar stomping grounds surfacing in fantastical tales.  </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>The booklet also reveals some interesting insights about the evolution of British humor, which maintains a distinctive edge to this day. Even the trope of the killer rabbit, which is now most famous as a Monty Python gag, turns up in “The Hunting of the Hare,” a poem that mockingly withholds the name of the village where it all supposedly happened because the performer doesn’t want to get into trouble.  </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“The comedy in the Heege Manuscript reminds us that being meta can be funny, whether you&#39;re in the fifteenth century or the twenty-first,” Wade told Motherboard. “In other words, a good technique for making people laugh is using the occasion or situation of the performance to make jokes, and those jokes tend toward either self-ironizing on the part of the performer, or mocking of the crowd.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>To that end, Wade plans to continue looking for texts that could be minstrel repertoires hiding in plain sight. Until then, Heege’s work survives as a “vestige of medieval life lived vibrantly: the good times being as good as they ever have been, and probably ever will,” according to the study.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“I think it&#39;s possible to look at the work of some medieval scribes and re-conceive them as collectors of folklore, oral storytelling, and song, alongside their more typical occupation of copying from prior written texts,” Wade concluded. “I have in mind a few other manuscripts I want to study with this in mind, and no doubt there are many other such manuscripts I don&#39;t yet know about—and that&#39;s exciting!” </p></span></p><div><div><div><p><h3>ORIGINAL REPORTING ON EVERYTHING THAT MATTERS IN YOUR INBOX.</h3></p><p>By signing up, you agree to the<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/terms-of-use.html">Terms of Use</a> <!-- -->and<!-- --> <a href="https://vice-web-statics-cdn.vice.com/privacy-policy/en_us/page/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> <!-- -->&amp; to receive electronic communications from Vice Media Group, which may include marketing promotions, advertisements and sponsored content.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
