<p>A next-generation COVID-19 mucosal vaccine is set to be a gamechanger not only when delivering the vaccine itself, but also for people who are needle-phobic.</p>



<p>New Griffith University research, published in Nature Communications, has been testing the efficacy of delivering a COVID-19 vaccine via the nasal passages.</p>

<p>Professor Suresh Mahalingam from Griffith’s Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics and Griffith Health has been working on this research for the past four years.</p>



<p>“This is a live attenuated intranasal vaccine, called CDO-7N-1, designed to be administered intranasally, thereby inducing potential mucosal immunity as well as systemic immunity with just a single dose,” Professor Mahalingam said.</p>



<p>“The vaccine induces strong memory responses in the nasal mucosa offering long-term protection for up to a year or more.</p>



<p>“It’s been designed to be administered as single dose, ideally as a booster vaccine, as a safe alternative to needles with no adverse reactions in the short or long term.”</p>



<p>Live-attenuated vaccines offer several significant advantages over other vaccine approaches.</p>



<p>They induce potent and long-lived humoral and cellular immunity, often with just a single dose.</p>



<p>Live-attenuated vaccines comprise the entire virus thereby providing broad immunity, in contrast to a single antigen which is used in many other vaccine platforms.</p>

<p>Lead author Dr Xiang Liu said the vaccine provides cross-protection against all variants of concern, and has neutralising capacity against SARS-CoV-1.</p>



<p>“The vaccine offers potent protection against transmission, prevents reinfection and the spread of the virus, while also reducing the generation of new variants,” Dr Liu said.</p>



<p>“Unlike the mRNA vaccine which targets only the spike protein, CDO-7N-1 induces immunity to all major SARS-CoV-2 proteins and is highly effective against all major variants to date.</p>



<p>“Importantly, the vaccine remains stable at 4°C for seven months, making it ideal for low- and middle-income countries.”</p>



<p>The vaccine has been licensed to Indian Immunologicals Ltd, a major vaccine manufacturer.</p>



<p> Dr. K. Anand Kumar, co-author of the publication and Managing Director of Indian Immunologicals Ltd. Said: “We are a leading ‘One Health’ company that has developed and launched several vaccines for human and animal use in India and are currently exporting to 62 countries.”</p>



<p>“We have completed all the necessary studies of this novel COVID-19 vaccine which offers tremendous advantages over other vaccines.</p>



<p>“We now look forward to taking the vaccine candidate to clinical trials.”</p>



<p>Professor Lee Smith, Acting Director of the Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, said he was delighted with the research findings.</p>



<p>“These results towards developing a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine are truly exciting,” Professor Smith said.</p>



<p>“Our researchers are dedicated to providing innovative and, crucially, more accessible solutions to combat this high-impact disease.”</p>
