This move will enable everyone in the global community to have free, immediate, and unrestricted access to the high-quality research published in the portfolio of RAS journals.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras"><i><span>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</span></i></a><span> (MNRAS), </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnrasl"><i><span>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society Letters</span></i></a><span> (MNRASL), and </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/gji"><i><span>Geophysical Journal International</span></i></a><span> (GJI) will join </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/rasti"><i><span>RAS Techniques and Instruments</span></i></a><span> (RASTI), a new journal launched by the Society in 2021, in being fully OA. The RAS journals portfolio will continue to publish alongside </span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo"><i><span>Astronomy &amp; Geophysics</span></i></a><span>, the RAS’s magazine for its Fellows, which will see no change.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>All articles published in the RAS journals portfolio, from the very first volumes published in 1827 to the latest articles, will be free to read in their entirety. As the scientific community works ever harder to ensure barriers to cutting edge science are eliminated, facilitating openness, dissemination, and reproducibility of impactful academic research, the Society is excited to be a key contributor to the open science movement, helping to drive discoverability and change. </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>With this move to OA the journals will no longer charge subscription fees and will instead be supported by Article Processing Charges (APCs), with the infrastructure to ensure that authors continue to face no financial barrier to publishing their science in the RAS journals.  </span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>The Society will support authors during the transition with an information hub on each of the journal websites, which can be accessed via the links below:</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/pages/mnras-open-access"><span>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</span></a></span></span></p><p><span><span><a href="https://academic.oup.com/gji/pages/gji-open-access"><span>Geophysical Journal International</span></a></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>RAS Executive Director Philip Diamond said: “The RAS is taking active strides in facilitating transparency, inclusivity, and accessibility of its high-quality research output to the advancement of science and the worldwide community of astronomers and geophysicists we strive to support, including our 4,000 Fellows.”</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>“Astronomy and geophysics research has vast applications. Our move to Open Access will help to ensure that we all benefit from the impact of this ground-breaking work being done by scientists all over the world.”</span></span></span></p><hr/><p><span><span><b><span>Media Contacts</span></b></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Gurjeet Kahlon</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Dr Robert Massey</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><b><span>RAS Publishing Contacts</span></b></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Ms Liz Baker / Dr Kim Clube</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><b><span>Notes for News Editors</span></b></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>The Royal Astronomical Society (RAS), founded in 1820, encourages and promotes the study of astronomy, solar-system science, geophysics and closely related branches of science. The RAS organises scientific meetings, publishes international research and review journals, recognises outstanding achievements by the award of medals and prizes, maintains an extensive library, supports education through grants and outreach activities and represents UK astronomy nationally and internationally. Its more than 4,000 members (Fellows), a third based overseas, include scientific researchers in universities, observatories and laboratories as well as historians of astronomy and others.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>All submissions to RAS journals undergo peer review, and their suitability for publication is assessed by appropriate specialist subject editors. The Society issues press releases based on a similar principle, but the organisations and scientists concerned have overall responsibility for their content.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Keep up with the RAS on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/royalastrosoc"><span><span>Twitter</span></span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://facebook.com/royalastrosoc"><span><span>Facebook</span></span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/royalastrosoc/"><span><span>Instagram</span></span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/royalastrosoc"><span><span>LinkedIn</span></span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalAstroSoc/feed"><span><span>YouTube</span></span></a><span>.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Oxford University Press (OUP) is a department of the University of Oxford.
