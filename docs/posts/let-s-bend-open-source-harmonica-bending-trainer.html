    <h1>Show HN: Let’s Bend – Open-Source Harmonica Bending Trainer</h1>

        <div><h2> Let&#39;s Bend - Learn to play the harmonica and bend like a pro </h2> <p> For beginners, <em>bending</em> notes on a harmonica is a big hurdle. It requires a lot of time through regular practice. By bending, even the semitones can be sounded on the harmonica through special drawing and blowing techniques, which cannot be reached by regular playing of the channels. Beginners ask themselves, &#34;Is that bending now or is the semitone exactly hit?&#34; </p> <p> The lean and performant <em>Lets&#39; Bend</em> app makes it easy and fun for anyone to master the art of bending. By visualising the notes you play, you&#39;ll be bending like a pro in no time. </p> <p> A short video about the functionality is published here:</p> <video controls="" width="100%"><source src="/videos/android_3.4.0.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>Your browser does not support the video tag.</video> <p> The original idea in developing the <em>Let&#39;s Bend</em> app was to create an application that is available on all common operating systems and whose application window scales well. It is not uncommon to have other applications open while practising or to want to use the programme on different devices. Last but not least, all keys and the most common special tunings of harmonicas should be supported.</p>  <p> As a result, there are now two versions of the app. A desktop version for the operating systems macOS, Debian and Windows, and an Android version for mobile devices.</p> <p> The Android version is published free of charge and without advertising on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.schliweb.bluesharpbendingapp&amp;hl=en">Google Play</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Christian-Kierdorf-Lets-Bend/dp/B0C96X2KRG">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://f-droid.org/de/packages/de.schliweb.bluesharpbendingapp/">F-Droid</a>.</p> <p> Since a publication on Microsoft Store and Apple App Store is associated with additional development costs that exceed the financial effort of a hobby development project, the desktop version was not published there. Instead, <a href="https://letsbend.de/download.html">here is an alternative download option for the desktop version.</a> </p> <p> As a preview, there is a <a href="https://letsbend.de/letsbend.html">web version</a> available here.</p> <p>For detailed instructions, check out our <a href="https://letsbend.de/doc.html">User Guide</a>.</p> <p> The source code of the applications is published <a href="https://github.com/egdels/bluesharpbendingapp">here.</a> </p><p> If you would like to support the developer of <em>Let&#39;s Bend</em> by making a voluntary donation, there is a <em>Buy me a coffee</em> function in the desktop version. But even here, <em>Let&#39;s Bend</em> remains free of charge. </p> <p> But enough talk now. <em>Let&#39;s Bend!</em></p></div>
