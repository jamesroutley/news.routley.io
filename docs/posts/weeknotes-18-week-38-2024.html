<li>&#34;life is a highway, and i&#39;m gonna ride it, every day&#39;s a winding road, yeah, my rollercoaster&#39;s got the biggest ups and downs, so long as it keeps going round it&#39;s unbelievable&#34; - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lqr7l8lrqUg">my rollercoaster, kimya dawson</a></li>
<li><a href="https://webdevconf.com/events/2024/">WDC2024</a> was amazing! come along in 2025? i lost an apple wall charger and a borrowed usb c to usb c on my travels so god bless to whoever finds them, hope they&#39;re useful to you.</li>
<li>getting back into tarot and origami, in my tentative journey to touching <del>grass</del> card and paper more often. i think a while ago i was trying too hard to enjoy crafts that require me to have better handwriting/motor control of a similar kind (like lettering and knitting and crochet). so i thought i didn&#39;t really enjoy many physical pastimes but i was wrong!</li>
<li>i&#39;m feeling called to write more about my (pseudo?) spiritual beliefs ever since I heard <a href="https://www.rachaelstephen.com/">rachael stephen</a> say that she&#39;s a fictionalist witch, aka it&#39;s a helpful fiction. people keep asking about the technopagan stuff and i want to have a piece to point to them to!</li>
<li>i started <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/456705/meditations-for-mortals-by-burkeman-oliver/9781847927613">meditations for mortals</a> and <a href="https://biancapereira.gumroad.com/l/100-days-of-note-taking">100 days of notetaking</a>, so far more compliant to the former but who amongst us is perfect anyway?</li>
<li>also really enjoying <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/443032/survival-is-a-promise-by-gumbs-alexis-pauline/9780241505717">pauline gumb&#39;s new biography of audre lorde</a>.</li>
<li>we&#39;re in the home stretch of the year now, can&#39;t believe it&#39;s less than a hundred days til 2025. i am encouraged and renewed by fresh starts rather than shook so please disregard if that struck terror into your heart lol. i&#39;m also looking forward to the next quarter and someone thought i was planning by financial quarters because i said Q4 lol. have they got a monopoly on quartering the year lads? we need to liberate quarters for corporate hegemony! bring planning back to the people!</li>
<li>want to do some sewing in this last quarter too. hold me to it?</li>
