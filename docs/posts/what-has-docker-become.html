    <p>It’s weird to see Docker Inc (the company) struggle to find its place in 2026. What started as the company that revolutionized how we deploy applications has been through multiple identity crises, pivoting from one strategy to another in search of sustainable revenue and market relevance.</p>
<h2 id="the-identity-crisis">The Identity Crisis</h2>
<p>Docker’s journey reads like a startup trying to find product-market fit, except Docker already had product-market fit - they created the containerization standard that everyone uses. The problem is that Docker the technology became so successful that Docker the company struggled to monetize it. When your core product becomes commoditized and open source, you need to find new ways to add value.</p>
<h2 id="the-swarm-exit">The Swarm Exit</h2>
<p>Docker Swarm was Docker’s attempt to compete with Kubernetes in the orchestration space. But Kubernetes won that battle decisively, and Docker eventually sold Swarm. This was a clear signal that Docker was stepping back from trying to be the full-stack container platform and instead focusing on what they could uniquely provide.</p>

<p>For a while, Docker seemed to focus on developer experience. This made sense - developers are Docker’s core users, and improving their workflow could be a differentiator. Docker Scout emerged from the acquisition of Atomist in June 2022, bringing “software supply chain” capabilities. Scout allows Docker to see not just what’s in a container, but how it was built and where vulnerabilities are. This was a smart move toward security and observability, areas where Docker could add real value.</p>
<p>Docker also acquired AtomicJar, the company behind Testcontainers, adding shift-left testing capabilities. Testcontainers lets developers run real dependencies (databases, message queues, etc.) in containers during testing, making integration tests more reliable and closer to production environments.</p>
<h2 id="the-ai-pivot">The AI Pivot</h2>
<p>Then came the AI pivot. Docker Model Runner entered the scene, positioning Docker as a platform for running AI models. Docker Compose expanded to support AI agents and models. Docker Offload was introduced for cloud-scale GPU execution of AI tasks. Partnerships with Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and AI SDKs (CrewAI, LangGraph, Vercel AI SDK) followed.</p>
<p>The acquisition of MCP Defender in September 2025 further cemented Docker’s move into AI security, focusing on securing agentic AI infrastructure and runtime threat detection. This was a significant shift - from developer tools to AI infrastructure.</p>
<h2 id="the-hardened-images-move">The Hardened Images Move</h2>
<p>Suddenly, Docker moved into the hardened images space. In December 2025, Docker made over 1,000 Docker Hardened Images free and open source under Apache 2.0, reducing vulnerabilities by up to 95% compared to traditional images. This move was likely triggered by Chainguard’s success in the secure container image space. Chainguard had been building a business around minimal, secure container images, and Docker needed to respond.</p>
<p>Making hardened images free was a bold move - it’s hard to compete with free, especially when it’s open source. But it also raises questions about Docker’s business model. If you’re giving away your security features for free, what are you selling?</p>
<h2 id="leadership-changes-and-acquisition-speculation">Leadership Changes and Acquisition Speculation</h2>
<p>In February 2025, Docker replaced CEO Scott Johnston (who led the company since 2019) with Don Johnson, a former Oracle Cloud Infrastructure founder and executive vice president. This leadership transition has prompted tech analysts to anticipate a potential acquisition by a major cloud provider. The CEO swap, combined with the strategic pivots, suggests Docker may be positioning itself for sale rather than building a standalone business.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-all-means">What This All Means</h2>
<p>Docker’s strategic shifts tell a story of a company searching for its place in a market it helped create. The containerization technology Docker pioneered became so successful that it became infrastructure - something everyone uses but no one wants to pay for directly.</p>
<p>The pivots from orchestration (Swarm) to developer tools (Scout, Testcontainers) to AI (Model Runner, MCP Defender) to security (Hardened Images) show a company trying different approaches to find sustainable revenue. Each pivot makes sense in isolation, but together they paint a picture of a company without a clear long-term vision.</p>
<p>The hardened images move is particularly interesting because it’s defensive - responding to Chainguard’s success rather than leading with innovation. Making it free and open source is a strong competitive move, but it doesn’t solve the fundamental business model question.</p>
<h2 id="the-future">The Future</h2>
<p>Docker the technology isn’t going anywhere. It’s too embedded in the infrastructure of modern software development. But Docker the company? That’s less clear. The leadership change, acquisition speculation, and rapid strategic pivots suggest Docker Inc may be positioning itself for an exit rather than building a long-term independent business.</p>
<p>For developers, this doesn’t change much. Docker containers will continue to work, and the open source nature of Docker means the technology will persist regardless of what happens to the company. But it’s worth watching how Docker Inc’s search for identity plays out - it could affect the ecosystem of tools and services built around containers.</p>
<p>The irony is that Docker created a standard so successful that it became infrastructure, and infrastructure is hard to monetize. Docker Inc’s struggle to find its place is a cautionary tale about the challenges of building a business around open source technology that becomes too successful.</p>
