    <h1>The new calculus of AI-based coding</h1>

<p>Over the past three months, a team of experienced, like-minded engineers and I have been building something really cool within Amazon Bedrock. While I&#39;m pretty excited about what we are building, there is another unique thing about our team  - most of our code is written by AI agents such as Amazon Q or Kiro. Before you roll your eyes: no, we&#39;re not vibe coding. I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s the right way to build robust software.</p><p>Instead, we use an approach where a human and AI agent collaborate to produce the code changes. For our team, every commit has an engineer&#39;s name attached to it, and that engineer ultimately needs to review and stand behind the code. We use steering rules to setup constraints for how the AI agent should operate within our codebase, and writing in Rust has been a great benefit. Rust compiler is famous for focusing on correctness and safety, catching many problems at compile time and providing helpful error messages that help the agent iterate. As a juxtaposition to vibe coding, I prefer the term &#34;agentic coding.&#34; Much less exciting but in our industry boring is usually good.</p><p>For me, roughly 80% of the code I commit these days is written by the AI agent. My personal workflow: break down the task until I have clarity in my own head (often using AI to explore approaches), prompt the AI agent, review its output, iterate with it until I like the results, and occasionally take over the change set and finish it myself. I pay attention to every line of code the agent produces, and don&#39;t accept them until I am fully satisfied with the quality of what is being produced - no different than if I wrote every line myself.</p><p>I&#39;ve always been an efficient coder, finding time to write code even in limited amount of time I&#39;ve been able to dedicate to coding over the past few years. And the last few months have been the highest coding throughput months of my career. My team is no different—we are producing code at 10x of typical high-velocity team. That&#39;s not hyperbole - we&#39;ve actually collected and analyzed the metrics.</p></div></div>
