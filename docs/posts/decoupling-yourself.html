    <h1>decoupling yourself</h1>

<p><em>building a resilient identity system</em></p>
<p>Here’s my theory. Hobbies are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQ">microservices</a> for people. Without a hobby, you could become too dependent on your job. Without a hobby, your self worth might become too attached with your current role at your company. If your job suddenly changes, that’s going to eat up a lot of your self-worth.</p>
<p>That’s what happened to me. I was gainfully employed as a software engineer. Then I left that job to work for myself for a year. During that time, the lack of a bona fide role at a proper company made me feel a bit lost. My theory is I could have saved some confusion and frustration by having a healthy hobby.</p>
<p><em>I think this also explains the feeling of displacement when individual contributors find their roles suddenly changed to management.</em></p>
<p>The theory revolves around how tightly your job is tied to your identity. People that frequently identify as their job title. How much does this sound like you? How often do you find yourself saying something like “I am an engineer doing engineer-y things on an engineering team.” How often do you answer “I work at X” when people ask “What do you do?”.</p>
<p>If this sounds like you, you might be feeling down on yourself if your job hasn’t been popping recently. If you are still nodding along to this, I’ve got a great suggestion for you: develop a hobby. Hobbies are a way to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)">decouple</a> your self worth from your job. Hobbies allow you to relate to other areas in your life without depending on your job.</p>
