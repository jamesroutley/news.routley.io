<p>Recently, there has been a rise in regulations drafted out of concern for exploitation of children, that have advocated measures that can completely erode privacy on the internet. In 2018 the US Congress passed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Enabling_Sex_Traffickers_Act">SESTA / FOSTA</a>, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSTA-SESTA#Legal_challenges">survived legal challenges</a> by free speech advocates like EFF. This month, the UK again published a draft of the <a href="https://www.brownejacobson.com/insights/uk-government-publishes-the-online-safety-bill-an-overview">Online Safety Bill</a> which “proposes measures to end anonymous browsing by requiring some online service providers to implement age-verification checks for users.” The State of Utah just <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/3/25/23655549/utah-social-media-law-children-facebook-instagram-tiktok-snapchat">passed a bill with similar requirements</a>, ostensibly forcing large online social platforms to begin obtaining proof of age <em>from all their users</em> by 2024.</p>


<p>Many of these regulators don’t understand the implications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">what’s possible</a> with technology. Their bills, though vague, can be interpreted so broadly as to end internet use as we know it. And while the initial concern may be for children, subsequent governments can use the snooping apparatus for all kinds of things, as we have already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-nsa-spying/u-s-court-mass-surveillance-program-exposed-by-snowden-was-illegal-idUSKBN25T3CK">seen the NSA unlawfully do because it was easy</a>. This isn’t restricted to authoritarian countries, but even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">liberal Western democracies</a> have engaged in covert and illegal surveillance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO">for decades</a>.</p>

<p>Often, regulators would like to subvert end-to-end encryption: the kind that encrypts conversations all the way between the end-users devices. In the US, the <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/01/earn-it-act-how-ban-end-end-encryption-without-actually-banning-it">EARN IT Act</a> sought to outright ban this kind of encryption, before an <a href="https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2020/06/there%E2%80%99s-now-even-worse-anti-encryption-bill-earn-it-doesn%E2%80%99t-make-earn-it-bill-ok">even worse LAED anti-encryption bill</a> was proposed. Trump’s attorney general was <a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/ag-barr-hails-house-bill-banning-warrant-proof-encryption">vocally in favor</a> after <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/14/apple-refuses-barr-request-to-unlock-pensacola-shooters-iphones.html">Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a shooting suspect</a>. In Australia, an anti-encryption bill <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/7/18130391/encryption-law-australia-global-impact">already passed in 2018</a>, and its <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/surveillance-state-incoming-with-australias-hacking-bill/">2021 “Hacking Bill”</a> can jeopardize privacy and security, with warrantless surveillance. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/26/coronavirus-lockdown-uae-residents-call-for-end-to-whatsapp-skype-ban.html">Dubai has banned</a> (ostensibly) end-to-end encrypted messengers like WhatsApp and Skype, except the ones that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/22/us/politics/totok-app-uae.html">their government secretly has a backdoor to</a>. Here is the situation around the world:</p>
