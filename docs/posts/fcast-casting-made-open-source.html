									<h2>What is FCast?</h2>

									<p>Embracing Open Development</p>

									<p>FCast is an open-source protocol designed to open wireless audio and video streaming to everybody. With support for various stream types like DASH, HLS, and mp4, it empowers developers to create their own unique streaming experiences.

									In contrast to traditional closed protocols, FCast champions open innovation. Developers can create custom receivers, integrate the client protocol into their own apps, or even enhance the protocol, contributing to an evolving open ecosystem.

									<h2>How to Get Started with FCast?</h2>

									<p>Setting Up Your Environment</p>
									
									<p>For users: Begin by setting up your receiver. Receivers compatible with Linux, Windows, MacOS (via Electron), or Android (native) are readily available. The receiver serves as the target for your media streams, and should be installed on the device you aim to cast to. Discover more about setting up your receiver <a href="https://gitlab.futo.org/videostreaming/fcast/">here</a>.</p>
									
									<p>For developers: If you&#39;re looking to build a custom receiver or to integrate FCast into your existing application, you&#39;ll find a wealth of resources at your disposal. Start by reviewing our <a href="https://gitlab.futo.org/videostreaming/fcast/-/tree/master/receivers">existing receiver implementations</a> for inspiration and guidance. For an in-depth understanding of how FCast works, our <a href="https://gitlab.futo.org/videostreaming/fcast/-/wikis/home">protocol documentation</a> is an indispensable resource.</p>
