The layoffs will impact Meta’s legacy Fundamental AI Research unit, also known as FAIR, along with its AI product and infrastructure division, while the company continues to hire workers for its newly formed superintelligence team, TBD Lab.</p><p>Meta spokesperson Ana Brekalo confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> that <em>Axios</em>’s reporting is accurate. Over the summer, Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/703929/meta-openai-anthropic-superintelligence-lab-ai-poaching-money">kicked off an AI hiring spree</a> after investing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/meta/685711/meta-scale-ai-ceo-alexandr-wang">$14.3 billion in Scale AI</a> and hiring CEO Alexandr Wang. It paused hiring just months later and announced a restructuring that will focus on AI-related products and infrastructure.</p><p>Meanwhile, Meta’s AI research team <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/14/meta-google-openai-artificial-intelligence-safety.html">has taken a backseat</a>, with FAIR leader Joelle Pineau leaving earlier this year. In August, Meta AI’s head <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/767746/meta-ai-superintelligence-lab-departures-scale-zuckerberg-memo">Wang said</a> that Meta “will aim to integrate and scale many of the research ideas and projects from FAIR into the larger model runs conducted by TBD Lab.”</p><p>Now, Meta is reducing roles inside FAIR and other divisions as it makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798764/meta-poached-thinking-machines-lab-co-founder-andrew-tulloch">high-profile hires</a> for TBD Lab.</p><p>”By reducing the size of our team, fewer conversations will be required to make a decision, and each person will be more load-bearing and have more scope and impact,” Wang writes in a memo seen by <em>Axios</em>. Meta will allow impacted employees to apply for other roles within the company, <em>Axios</em> reports.</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 22nd:</strong> Added confirmation from Meta.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTE2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Emma Roth</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div>
