			<p>What are my options here?</p>

</p>

<p>Inside the &#34;Remind me again in&#34; label are the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Week</li>
<li>30 days</li>
</ul>

<p>And when I select one option, what does &#34;No thanks&#34; do? Does it dismiss the box entirely and I never have to see it? Or does it validate the reminder schedule? What if I just don&#39;t want OneDrive? Microsoft has embedded it so deep into Windows that there are no easy ways of getting rid of it. I would understand if they had asked me when I set up my machine the first time, but why every single time?</p>

<p>This is the illusion of choice. It is &#34;Get it now&#34; or &#34;Get it later&#34;. What I&#39;m looking for is the &#34;Get it never option!&#34;</p>

<p>Dark patterns at their finest.</p>
