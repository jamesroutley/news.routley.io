They were obtained by chemical synthesis from <span>mineral</span> starting materials and refer to chemical compounds: Egyptian Blue (CaCuSi<small><sub>4</sub></small>O<small><sub>10</sub></small>), Han Blue (BaCuSi<small><sub>4</sub></small>O<small><sub>10</sub></small>) and Han Purple (BaCuSi<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>6</sub></small>), Maya Blue (<span>x</span>·indigo·(Mg,Al)<small><sub>4</sub></small>Si<small><sub>8</sub></small>(O,OH,H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O)<small><sub>24</sub></small>) and Ultramarine Blue (Na,Ca)<small><sub>8</sub></small>(AlSiO<small><sub>12</sub></small>)(S, SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>,Cl). The Egyptian and Chinese copper-based pigments are assumed to have been developed independently and are presumably an outcome of the historical developments in glazing techniques. A technology transfer from Egypt into China cannot be fully excluded but, based on the facts acquired up to now, looks less probable.</p></div><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td><img alt="Heinz Berke" src="https://pubs.rsc.org/image/article/2007/CS/b606268g/b606268g-p1.gif"/><p><span>Heinz Berke</span></p></td><td><i><p>H.

Berke&#39;s fundamental research activities cover various fields of organometallic chemistry. Major efforts are devoted to the area of transition metal hydrides, which is related to homogeneous catalysis, in particular homogeneous hydrogenations and hydrosilations. Metal–carbon oriented activities concern several catalyses of C–C coupling reactions mediated by transition metal complexes and in addition metallacumulenes, where carbon chained units are sought to space transition metal centers for potential use as single-electron devices. Another research field deals with the archaeometry of ancient, manmade blue and purple pigments.</p></i></td></tr></tbody></table><hr/>
    
      
      <h2 id="sect228"><span>1. Blue and purple</span></h2>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect231"><span>1.1 Art, matter and blue in particular</span></h3>
        <p><span>Colours are an intrinsic part of human life. They produce aesthetic stimulation and they fascinate. They are the means of expression in art and they form part of the human culture. The blue colour, however, differs from all the other colours. At all times in history, people ascribed to it a special dimension.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span>1</span></sup></a> Yves Klein, the “blue entrepreneur”, who in 1957 started using solely blue for his paintings and sculptures, put it like this: <span>Blue has no dimension, it exceeds everything… All colours evoke associations…, whereas blue is reminiscent of the sea and the sky, which are the most abstract parts of the tangible and visible nature</span>. The opinion of this art expert has not been seconded unanimously; yet, its mere existence may highlight the fact that blue is considered to be different from all other colours.</span></p><p>The materialised forms of colour are <span>dyes</span> and pigments. They form the material basis of art. Despite this fundamental role as <span>conditio sine qua non</span>, the role of matter in art was due to a very rigoristic way of thinking only marginally accepted during the European Middle Ages, the Renaissance and still in the early 18th century.</p>
        <p>During times of the theological hegemony and according to the viewpoint of spirit–matter dualism, both matter as the material basis and the craft of matter, which is in chemistry, alias alchemy was not ascribed much importance. “Vulgar” chemistry (alchemy) was due to people&#39;s disrespect of its ideational properties not sufficiently recognised as a science working in favour of art. Chemistry (alchemy) was made use of in artists&#39; studios, but it lacked prestige, which was also shown by its <span>de facto</span> exclusion from the academic world. A simple example shows, however, to what extent chemistry (alchemy) still managed to have an ideational influence on art: The blue pigment lapis lazuli features, as a <span>mineral</span>, changing amounts of various impurities; thus, it is usually not suitable for use in painting without its undergoing (al)chemical separation processes. Hence, in medieval times, there were several procedures to purify lapis lazuli, some of which were kept secret. The use of chemistry (alchemy) allowed improved colour saturation and brilliance, which resulted in better expression in art.</p>
        <p>Only toward the end of the 18th century, did science become liberated from the theological hegemony. Science&#39;s coalition in the battle for recognition was rewarded with a massive leap forward.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span>2</span></sup></a> People grew more prepared to make use of scientific cognition. And, as chemistry was becoming more rational, there was a growing insight that art and chemistry complement one another with mutual advantages for both sides. As a consequence, the high-quality industrial pigments were developed, some of which had been available since the beginning of the 19th century, and could be used without restraint as of the second part of the 19th century; this was one of the largest benefits chemistry had on art. A silent revolution had taken place and new possibilities for expression advanced the impressionistic style.</p>
        <p>In the co-evolution of art and science, both sides generally reaped more benefits from the other than they were willing to acknowledge.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span>3</span></sup></a> For ancient cultures, art and science were one entity; this was mainly due to their state of development, which was still defined mostly by the necessities of life and their technical possibilities. The craft of chemistry (alchemy) was, without reservation, used as the material basis for painting. This was the case in particular for the blue colour and the related purple colour, as the material basis in the form of herbal and animal constituents and <span>minerals</span> for these two colours were, as opposed to the elements of all other colours, not sufficiently available. This lack of resources challenged respective craftsmen at the time, being alchemists, to contrive innovative ideas in many ways.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect248"><span>1.2 The blue <span>minerals</span> in ancient and in medieval times</span></h3>
        <p><span>As mentioned previously, the availability of colouring substances played a decisive role in cultural developments and in art. In prehistoric times, only the so-called earth colours, colours provided by the surface soil, could be used as pigments. Blue is not an earth colour and was therefore not available to prehistoric humans as a pigment. Visitors of prehistoric caves, such as the caves of Altamira in Spain or Lasceaux in France, thus notice that in the paintings on the walls of the caves, there is no blue colour.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span>4</span></sup></a> In antiquity, the palette of available pigments could be expanded with the help of mining. The trade of mining required specialised mineralogical expertise and technical developments as civilizing achievements, which had been largely unchanged up to the Middle Ages.</span></p><p>The gemstone lapis lazuli was the source of the blue <span>minerals</span> obtained through mining in ancient and medieval times (lapis lazuli is in mineralogy called lazurite and contains variable amounts of calcium (Na,Ca)<small><sub>8</sub></small>(AlSiO<small><sub>12</sub></small>)(S,SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>,Cl)). In ancient times, lapis lazuli was valued for its stability and for its brilliance apparent in very pure lapis lazuli. The almost ubiquitous, but unstable <span>azurite</span> is a <span>mineral</span> containing copper (Cu<small><sub>3</sub></small>(CO<small><sub>3</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>(OH)<small><sub>2</sub></small>). Depending on its environment, it will eventually transform into <span><a title="Chemspider Compound link for:malachite" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.23796.html">malachite</a></span>, a green pigment, and is unsuitable for outdoor use. Lapis lazuli was in ancient times mined in only one location, situated in the area of present-day Afghanistan (Badakhshan). It should be mentioned that in ancient China, the use of natural lapis lazuli was not as common as in other cultures (Persia, Mesopotamia, Egypt). The factual reasons are not known; however, it may be due to the fact that the Chinese disposed of artificially manufactured blue and <span>azurite</span>, the latter in almost unlimited amounts. Furthermore, <span>minerals</span> containing cobalt that only after a manufacturing process in glasses and glazes transformed into a blue colour were used.</p>
        <p>Probably in the early 10th century AD, the blue <span>mineral</span> vivianite (Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>(PO<small><sub>4</sub></small>)<small><sub>2</sub></small>·8H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O) became a speciality of the European medieval times, mined in areas north of the Alps, and was used as a pigment.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span>5</span></sup></a> Vivianite is an unstable iron phosphate <span>mineral</span> with variable iron(<span>II</span>/<span>III</span>) content that is completely colourless if kept in an oxygen-free environment (solely contains iron(<span>II</span>)) and that, if exposed to oxygen, will over time oxidise into blue and eventually brown compounds with a higher iron(<span>III</span>) content. Nowadays, this <span>mineral</span> would not be used as a pigment due to its too low stability. The use in the European Middle Ages can be explained only with the lack of suitable alternatives. Blue vivianite may be found mainly in the vicinity of ore deposits near the Earth&#39;s surface and in pegmatite deposit areas if waters containing <span>phosphates</span> reach that area. The <span>mineral</span> <span>oxidation</span> product of vivianite is the brown santabarbaraite pseudomorphus, in which half of the iron atoms are iron(<span>II</span>) and the other half iron(<span>III</span>).</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect286"><span>1.3 Necessity has been the mother of invention—especially in ancient times</span></h3>
        <p><span>The notable German art historian J. J. Winckelmann described antique art with the phrase <span>Noble simplicity and quiet grandeur</span> (<span>Edle Einfalt und stille Grösse</span>). He acted on the erroneous assumption that polychromy of art objects was not of real importance for the antique human being. The contrary was the case:<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span>6</span></sup></a> colour and painted objects were valued greatly in ancient times and their frequent use aggravated the lack of, mainly the rare, blue colour materials. Only by the end of the 18th century was there a fundamental change in the special situation of the scarcity of blue pigments; new blue pigments were invented and later, at the outset of industrialisation, many more new blue and purple materials were created chemically. Also, known natural materials could be produced artificially on a large scale in sufficient amounts. Necessity is the mother of invention!</span></p><p>According to the current state of knowledge, there were three geographic areas in ancient times in which special blue and purple pigments were contrived and produced (see also atlas for the distribution of Egyptian Blue and Han Blue and Purple (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21</a>) and <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>):</p>
        <p>• The Mediterranean area, incl. Egypt, as of approx. 3600 BC, the Middle East (Mesopotamia, Persia), and later also the areas of ancient Greece and the Roman Empire, where Egyptian Blue (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>) was produced<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span>7</span></sup></a> and cobalt was used to colour glasses and glazes and was also occasionally used as a pigment in a glass-bound form (smalt).</p>
        <p>• The area of ancient China in which, according to the current state of knowledge, the synthetic pigments Chinese Blue and Chinese Purple (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>), also called Han Blue and Han Purple, were produced; the area extends on a relatively limited territory about 200–300 km north of the ancient city of Xian. Today it is thought that, in this area in northern China, Ultramarine Blue (“artificial lapis lazuli”) might also have been produced (∼800 BC) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>
        <p>• The area of Middle America with the Indian cultures, which, as of approx. 400 AD, produced Maya Blue (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a>), an intercalation compound of <span><a title="Chemspider Compound link for:indigo" target="_blank" href="http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.4477009.html">indigo</a></span> into the white clays of palygorskite.</p>
