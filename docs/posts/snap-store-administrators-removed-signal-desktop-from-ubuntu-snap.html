<p>perhaps someone from the <a href="https://capnfabs.net/groups/snapcrafters">@Snapcrafters</a> team has an idea why it is hidden now ?</p>

          <p>Hmm, I tested another machine, which I installed <code>signal-desktop</code> a while ago.</p>
<p>Now <code>snap list</code> shows its publisher as <code>snap-quarantine</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ snap list | grep signal-desktop
signal-desktop 5.59.0 397  snap-quarantine
</code></pre>
<p>This seems not good. Maybe it suggests that the package has been somehow
corrupted?</p>

          <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I understand the sudden move of signal-desktop can be disruptive for people wishing to install this package. Just to confirm the reason for the absence - Snap Store administrators had to remove the snap in accordance with our policies. We hope to have it back shortly.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience and understanding.</p>

<p>Considering the extraordinary amount of trust given to the application itself and implicitly to those who package and distribute it, could you please give an indication of the impact on existing users on a scale from “Code indentation not compliant with style guide” to “All your keystrokes and messages are being sent to $evilorg”.</p>

<p>Certainly, and this is a great question. There is NO impact to existing users. If you have the application/snap installed, you can continue to use it confidently.</p>

          <p>I was just linked to this thread from <a href="https://github.com/snapcrafters/signal-desktop/issues/70">our issue tracker</a></p>
<p>As a maintainer for this snap package, it’s mind-boggling to me that, even after almost two weeks, the store team did not contact me at all. I had to find this out myself from users reporting it on our bug tracker.</p>
<p>After almost two weeks, the maintainer of the snap has not received <em>any</em> official communication about this, but <a href="https://capnfabs.net/u/roadmr">@roadmr</a> was able to provide this tiny sliver of info in a thread on this forum. This is an incredible breakdown in communication and is not how maintainers should be treated!</p>

<p>That’s hardly a “reason for the absence”. Just saying that it was removed is no explanation nor a reason. That’s just answering the question “Why?” with “Because”. So what’s the reason the app got removed?</p>

          <p>As an interested user who appreciates the work done by both snap maintainers and snapcrafters,  it would be really good to see this situation resolved in such a way that we can be reasonably confident that appropriate communication between all three parties about status is handled systematically and openly.</p>
<p>Naturally none of us expect perfection or immediate resolution of all related issues, but this case illustrates some opportunities for improvement. In my case, my ignorance of where to go from <code>snap-quarantine</code> is an  issue for me (though my initial RTFM and STFW efforts have turned up little so far).</p>

          <p>My biggest two issues here are:</p>
<ol>
<li>No communication to those maintaining the snap</li>
<li>Messaging that we’ve elicited has been “removed due to policy” without any explanation of which policy or where to find the list of these policies that we can read to understand under what circumstances such removals <em>may</em> occur.
<ul>
<li>I get that there may be scenarios where the details cannot be divulged but the policy that is being used to trigger a removal/quarantine <em>must</em> be communicated, rather than citing the nebulous “but muh policy” response. When a lack of detail is required there <em>must also</em> be a defined timeline to provide updates so that we can be sure that situations won’t run on forever.</li>

          <p>Hi Merlijn,</p>
<p>Please accept my apologies on the miscommunication here. Our process does state to contact the snap’s publisher - since the snap is ostensibly owned by snapcrafters and the most recent uploads were all done by a generic snapcrafters account, I was under the (mistaken) impression I’d covered this by mentioning to a contact within snapcrafters.</p>
<p>I should have checked the list of active collaborators, of which you are one, and also given them (you!) a heads-up about this process.</p>
<p>I’m updating our process documentation to be very explicit about this for future cases.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>This is due to a DMCA takedown request coming from people representing Signal. Canonical is currently working with Signal to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>There was an initial communication breakdown between me and Canonical due to how the Snapcrafters publisher is structured. Canonical is changing their procedures to make sure this communication breakdown doesn’t happen in the future anymore.</p>
<p>I’ve suggested to Canonical to be more transparent with DMCA takedown requests, similar to how GitHub does it. Last I heard, they were discussing this internally.</p>
