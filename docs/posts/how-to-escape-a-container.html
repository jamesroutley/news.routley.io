<h3>Section 2.	Using Cisco Technology</h3>
<p>2.1	License and Right to Use. Cisco grants You, for Your direct benefit during the Usage Term and for the full scope of Your Entitlement under this Agreement, a non-exclusive, non-transferable (except with respect to Software as permitted under the Cisco Software Transfer and Re-Use Policy) (a) license to use the Software; and (b) right to use the Cloud Services (collectively, the “Usage Rights”).

You agree that Cisco, in its sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate Your Usage Rights (or any part thereof) and that any termination may be without prior notice and without liability to Cisco. Cisco may, for example, suspend or terminate Your Usage Rights if (i) Cisco has reason to believe that You engaged in any fraudulent behaviour as it relates to the Cloud Services, or (ii) You use Cisco Technology beyond Your Entitlement. You are solely responsible for exporting Your customer data from the Cisco Technology prior to termination, and, except as required by law, Cisco will provide You a reasonable opportunity to retrieve such data.</p>

Unless expressly agreed by Cisco, You may not (a) transfer, sell, sublicense, monetize, or make the functionality of any Cisco Technology available to any third party; (b) use the Software on second hand or refurbished Cisco equipment not authorized by Cisco, or use Software that is licensed for a specific device on a different device (except as permitted under Cisco’s Software License Portability Policy); (c) remove, modify, or conceal any product identification, copyright, proprietary, intellectual property notices or other marks; (d) reverse engineer, decompile, decrypt, disassemble, modify, or make derivative works of the Cisco Technology; or (e) use Cisco Content other than as part of Your permitted use of the Cisco Technology.
