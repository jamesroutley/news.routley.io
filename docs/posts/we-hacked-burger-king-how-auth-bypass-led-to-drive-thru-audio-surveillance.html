    <h1>We hacked Burger King: How auth bypass led to drive-thru audio surveillance</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <h2>DMCA Notice Received</h2>
            <p>
                We received a DMCA copyright infringement complaint from Cyble Inc., acting on behalf of Burger King, 
                regarding our blog post about Restaurant Brands International&#39;s drive-thru system vulnerabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The complaint alleges trademark infringement and claims the content &#34;promotes illegal activity and spreads false information.&#34;
            </p>
        </div><div>
            <h2>About the Complaint</h2>
            <p>
                Cyble Inc. is an AI-powered cybersecurity platform and DMCA takedown service startup backed by Y Combinator. 
                Their complaint specifically states that our use of the &#34;Burger King&#34; trademark was unauthorized and creates 
                &#34;a high degree of confusion among the public that the website is in some way endorsed by/or linked with our Client.&#34;
            </p>
            <p>
                The notice claims our security research content &#34;promotes illegal activity and spreads false information&#34; 
                and that such activities are &#34;detrimental to the goodwill and reputation&#34; of their client and &#34;actionable at law under gross unfair competition.&#34;
            </p>
        </div><div>
            <h2>Our Response</h2>
            <p>
                After reviewing the complaint, we have decided to take down the blog post in question to avoid any legal complications.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we believe our security research was conducted ethically and in the public interest, 
                we have chosen to remove the content rather than engage in a legal dispute.
