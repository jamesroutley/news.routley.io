    <h1>Demystifying the regular expression that checks if a number is prime (2016)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>A while back I was researching the most efficient way to check if a number is
prime. This lead me to find the following piece of code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>isPrime</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>!</span><span>new</span> <span>String</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>char</span><span>[</span><span>n</span><span>]).</span><span>matches</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;.?|(..+?)\\1+&#34;</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I was intrigued. While this might not be the most efficient way, it’s
certainly one of the less obvious ones, so my curiosity kicked in.
How on Earth could a match for the <code>.?|(..+?)\1+</code> regular expression tell that
a number is <strong>not</strong> prime (once it’s converted to its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_numeral_system">unary representation</a>)?</p>

<p>If you’re interested, read on, I’ll try to dissect this regular expression and
explain what’s really going on. The explanation will be programming language
agnostic, <a href="#4-code-examples">I will, however, provide</a> <code>Python</code>, <code>JavaScript</code> and <code>Perl</code> versions
of the <code>Java</code> code above and explain why they are slightly different.</p>

<p>I will explain how the regular expression <code>^.?$|^(..+?)\1+$</code> can filter out
any prime numbers. Why this one and not <code>.?|(..+?)\1+</code> (the one used in <code>Java</code> code example above)?
Well, this has to do with the way <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#matches-java.lang.String-">String.matches()</a> works, which <a href="#3-the-java-case">I’ll explain later</a>.</p>

<p>While there are some blog posts on this topic, I found them to not go deep enough
and give just a high level overview, not explaining some of the important details well enough.
Here, I’ll try to lay it out with enough detail so that anyone can follow and understand.
The goal is to make it simple to understand for any one - whether you are a regular expression
guru or this is the first time you’ve heard about them, anyone should be able to follow along.</p>



<p>Let’s start at a higher level. But wait, first, let’s get every one on the same
page and begin with some definitions. If you know know what a prime number is
and are familiar with regular expression, feel free to <a href="#the-regular-expression-that-tells-if-a-number-is-prime">skip this section</a>.
I will try to explain how every bit of the regular expression works, so that even
people who are new or unfamiliar with them can follow along.</p>

<h2 id="prime-numbers">Prime Numbers</h2>

<p>First, a <strong>prime number</strong> is any natural number greater than <code>1</code> <strong>that is only divisible by 1 and the number itself, without leaving a remainder</strong>.
Here’s a list of the first <code>8</code> prime numbers: <code>2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19</code>.
For example, <code>5</code> is prime because you can only divide it by <code>1 </code> and <code>5</code> 
without leaving a remainder. Sure we can divide it by <code>2</code>, but that
would leave a remainder of <code>1</code>, since <code>5</code> = <code>2</code>*<code>2</code> + <code>1</code>.
The number <code>4</code>, on the other hand, is <strong>not prime</strong>, since we can divide it
by <code>1</code>, <code>2</code> and <code>4</code> without leaving a remainder.</p>

<h2 id="regular-expressions">Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>Okay, now let’s get to the regular expression (A.K.A. regex) syntax. Now, there are quite a few regex
flavors, I’m not going to focus on any specific one, since that is not the
point of this post. The concepts described here
work in a similar manner in all of the most common flavors, so don’t worry
about it. If you want to learn more about regular expressions, check out
<a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">Regular-Expressions.info</a>, it’s a great
resource to learn regex and later use it as a reference.</p>

<p>Here’s a cheatsheet with the concepts that will be needed for the explanation
that follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>^</code> - matches the position before the first character in the string</li>
  <li><code>$</code> - matches the position right after the last character in the string</li>
  <li><code>.</code> - matches any character, except line break characters (for example, it does not match <code>\n</code>)</li>
  <li><a name="alternation-operator"></a><code>|</code> - matches everything that’s either to the left or the right of it. You can think of it as an <strong>or</strong> operator.</li>
  <li><code>(</code> and <code>)</code> delimit a <strong>capturing group</strong>. By placing a part of a regular expression between parentheses, you’re grouping that part of the regular expression together. This allows you to apply <strong>quantifiers</strong> (like <code>+</code>)
to the entire group or restrict alternation (<em>i.e.</em> “or”: <code>|</code>) to part of the
regular expression. Besides that, parentheses also create a <strong>numbered capturing group</strong>, which you can refer to later with <strong>backreferences</strong> (<a href="https://illya.sh/the-codeumentary-blog/regular-expression-check-if-number-is-prime/capturing-groups-and-backreferences">more on that below</a>)</li>
  <li><a name="backref"></a><code>\&lt;number_here&gt;</code> - <strong>backreferences</strong> match the same text as previously matched by a capturing group. The <code>&lt;number_here&gt;</code> is the <strong>group number</strong> (remember the discussion above? The one that says that parentheses create a <strong>numbered capturing group</strong>? That’s where it comes in). I’ll give an example to clarify things in a little bit, so if you’re confused, hang on!</li>
  <li><code>+</code> - matches the preceding token (for example, it can be a character or a group of characters, if the preceding token is a <strong>capturing group</strong>) <strong>one or more times</strong></li>
  <li><code>*</code> - matches the preceding token <strong>zero or more times</strong></li>
  <li><a name="greedy-qmrk"></a>if <code>?</code> is used after <code>+</code> or <code>*</code> quantifiers, it makes that quantifier <strong>non-greedy</strong> (<a href="#greedy-and-non-greedy-quantifiers">more on that below</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="capturing-groups-and-backreferences">Capturing Groups and Backreferences</h3>

<p>As promised, let’s clarify how <strong>capturing groups</strong> and <strong>backreferences</strong> work together.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, parentheses create <strong>numbered capturing groups</strong>. What do I
mean by that? Well, that means that when you use parentheses, you create a
group that matches some characters and you can refer to those <strong>matched characters</strong> later on. The numbers are given to the groups in the order they
appear in the regular expression, beginning with <code>1</code>. For example, let’s say
you have the following regular expression: <code>^aa(bb)cc(dd)$</code>. Note, that in this
case, we have <code>2</code> groups. They are numbered as follows:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7T2JC1A.png" alt="Regular Expression capturing group numbers"/></p>

<p>This means that we can refer to the characters matched by them later using
<strong>backreferences</strong>. If we want to refer to what is matched by <code>(bb)</code>, we use
<code>\1</code> (we use <code>1</code> because we’re referring to the <strong>capturing group #1</strong>). To refer to the characters matched by <code>(dd)</code> we use <code>\2</code>. Putting that together,
the the regular expression <code>^aa(bb)cc(dd)\1$</code> matches the string <code>aabbccddbb</code>.
Note how we used <code>\1</code> to refer to the last <code>bb</code>. <code>\1</code> refers to <strong>what was matched</strong> by the group <code>(bb)</code>, which in this case, was the sting <code>bb</code>.</p>

<p>Now note that I emphasize on <strong>what was matched</strong>. I really mean the 
characters that <strong>were matched</strong> and not ones that <strong>can be matched</strong>.
This means, that the regular expression <code>^aa(.+)cc(dd)\1$</code>
<strong>does match</strong> the sting <code>aaHELLOccddHELLO</code>, but <strong>does not</strong> match the sting
<code>aaHELLOccddGOODBYE</code>, since it cannot find what was matched by the <strong>group #1</strong> (in this case it’s the character sequence <code>HELLO</code>) after the character sequence <code>dd</code> (it finds <code>GOODBYE</code> there).</p>

<h3 id="greedy-and-non-greedy-quantifiers">Greedy and Non-Greedy Quantifiers</h3>

<p>If you remember correctly, in the cheatseheet above, I mentioned that <code>?</code>
<a href="#greedy-qmrk">can be used to make the preceding quantifier non-greedy</a>.
Well, okay, but what does that actually mean? <code>+</code> is greedy quantifier, this
means that <strong>it will try to repeat the preceding token as many times as possible</strong>, <em>i.e.</em> it will try to consume as much input as it can. The same
is true for the <code>*</code> quantifier.</p>

<p>For example, let’s say we have the string <code>&lt;p&gt;The Documentary&lt;/p&gt; (2005)</code> and
the regular expression <code>&lt;.+&gt;</code>. Now, you might think that it will match
<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, but that’s not true. The matched string will actually be <code>&lt;p&gt;The Documentary&lt;/p&gt;</code>. Why is that? Well, that has to do with the fact mentioned
above: the <code>+</code> <strong>will try to consume as much input as it can</strong>, so that means
that it will not stop at the first <code>&gt;</code>, but rather at the last one.</p>

<p>Now how do we go about making a quantifier <strong>non-greedy</strong>? Well, you might
be already tired of hearing that (since I’ve already mentioned it twice),
but <strong>in order to make a greedy quantifier non-greedy, you put a question mark (?) in front of it</strong>. 
It’s really as simple as that. In case you’re still confused, don’t worry,
let’s see an example.</p>

<p>Suppose we have the same string: <code>&lt;p&gt;The Documentary&lt;/p&gt; (2005)</code>, but this
time, we only want to match what is between the first <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>.
How would we go about that? Well, all we have to do is add <code>?</code> in front of
the <code>+</code>. This will lead us to the <code>&lt;.+?&gt;</code> regex. “Uhhh, okay…”, you might wonder,
“But what does that actually do?”. Well, it will make the <code>+</code> quantifier
<strong>non-greedy</strong>. This means that it <strong>will make the quantifier consume as little input as possible</strong>.
Well, in our case, the “as little as possible” is <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, which is
exactly what we want! To be precise, it will match both of the <code>p</code>’s: <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>, but we can easily get what we want by asking for the fist match (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>).</p>

<h3 id="a-little-note-on--and-">A Little Note On ^ and $</h3>

<p>Since we’re on it, I’ll take a moment to quickly explain what the <code>^</code> and
<code>$</code> actually do. If you remember correctly, <code>^</code> matches the position right
before the first character in the string and <code>$</code> matches the position right after the last character in the string. Note how in both of the regular
expressions above (<code>&lt;.+&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;.+?&gt;</code>) we did not use them. What does that
mean? Well, that means that <strong>the match does not have to begin at the start of the string and end at the end of the string</strong>.
Taking the second, non-greedy, regex (<code>&lt;.+?&gt;</code>) and the sting <code>The Game - &lt;p&gt;The Documentary&lt;/p&gt; (2005)</code>, we would still obtain our expected matches (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>),
since we’re not forcing it to begin at the beginning of the string and end
at the end of the string.</p>



<p>Phew, so we’re finally done with the theoretical introduction and now, since we’ve
already have everything we need under the belt, we’re ready to dive into
the analysis of how the <code>^.?$|^(..+?)\1+$</code> regular expression can match
<strong>non-prime</strong> numbers (in their unary form).</p>

<p>You can ignore the <code>?</code> in the regular expression, it’s there for performance reasons (<a href="#what-about-the">explained below</a>) - 
it makes the <code>+</code> non-greedy. If it confuses you, just ignore it and consider 
that the regex is actually <code>^.?$|^(..+)\1+$</code>, it works as well, but it’s slower (with some exceptions, like when the number <strong>is</strong> prime, where the <code>?</code> makes no difference whatsoever).
After explaining how this regular expression works, I’ll also <a href="#what-about-the">explain</a> what that <code>?</code> does there,
you shouldn’t have any trouble understanding it after you understand the inner workings of this
regex.</p>

<p><a name="unary-representation"></a>All of the discussion below assumes that we have the number represented in
its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_numeral_system">unary form</a> (or base-1, if you prefer). It doesn’t actually have to be represented as
a sequence of <code>1</code>s, it can be a sequence of any characters that are
matched by <code>.</code>. This means that <code>5</code> does not have to be represented as
<code>11111</code>, it might as well be represented as <code>fffff</code> or <code>BBBBB</code>. As long
as there are <strong>five characters</strong>, we’re good to go. Please note, that the
characters have to be the same, <strong>no mixtures of characters are allowed</strong>,
this means that we <strong>cannot</strong> represent <code>5</code> as <code>ffffB</code>, since here we have a mixture
of two different characters.</p>

<h2 id="high-level-overview">High Level Overview</h2>

<p>Let’s begin with a high level overview and then dive into the details.
Our <code>^.?$|^(..+?)\1+$</code> regular expression consists of two parts: <code>^.?$</code> and
<code>^(..+?)\1+$</code>.</p>

<p>As a heads-up, I just want to say that I’m lying a little in the explanation
in the <a href="#hlw-regex-2">paragraph</a> about the <code>^(..+?)\1+$</code> regex. The lie has to do with the order in which the regex engine
checks for multiples, it actually starts with the highest number and goes to the lowest,
and not how I explain it here. But feel free to ignore that distinction here, 
since the regular expression still matches the same thing, it just does it in more
steps (so I’ll actually be explaining how <code>^.?$|^(..+?)\1+?$</code> works: notice the extra <code>?</code> after the <code>+</code>.</p>

<p>I’m doing this because I believe this explanation is less verbose and easier to understand.
And don’t worry, I explain how I lied and <a href="#the-shocking-truth">reveal the shocking truth</a>
later on, so keep on reading. Well, maybe it’s not really that shocking, but 
I wanna keep you engaged, so I’ll stick to that naming.</p>

<p>The regex engine will first try to match <code>^.?$</code>, then, if it fails, it will try to
match <code>^(..+?)\1+$</code>. Note that <strong>the number of characters matched corresponds to the matched number</strong>,
<em>i.e.</em> if 3 characters are matched, that means that number <code>3</code> was matched, if 
26 characters are matched, that means that the number <code>26</code> was matched.</p>

<p><code>^.?$</code> matches strings with zero or one characters (corresponds to the numbers
<code>0</code> and <code>1</code>, respectively).</p>

<p><a name="hlw-regex-2"> </a><code>^(..+?)\1+$</code> first tries to match 2 characters (corresponds to the number 2),
then 4 characters (corresponds to the number 4), then 6 characters, then 8
characters and so on. Basically it will try to match <strong>multiples of 2</strong>.
If that fails, it will try to first match 3 characters (corresponds to the number 3),
then 6 characters (corresponds to the number 6), then 9 characters, then 12 characters
and so on. This means that it will try to match <strong>multiples of 3</strong>. If that fails,
it proceeds to try match <strong>multiples of 4</strong>, then if that fails it will try
to match <strong>multiples of 5</strong> and so on, until the number whose multiple it tries to match is
the length of the string (<strong>failure</strong> case) or there is a successful match (<strong>success</strong> case).</p>

<h2 id="diving-deeper">Diving Deeper</h2>

<p>Note, that both of parts of the regular expression begin with a <code>^</code> symbol and end with a <code>$</code> symbol, this 
forces to what’s in between those symbols (<code>.?</code> in the first case and <code>(..+)\1+</code> in the second case) 
<strong>to start at the beginning of the string and end at the end of the string</strong>. 
In our case that string is the <a href="#unary-representation">unary representation of the number</a>. 
Both of the parts are separated separated by an <a href="#alternation-operator">alternation operator</a>,
this means that <strong>either only one of them will be matched or neither will</strong>.
If the number is prime, a match <strong>will not</strong> occur. If the number is not prime a
match <strong>will</strong> occur. To summarize, we concluded that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>either <code>^.?$</code> or <code>^(..+?)\1+$</code> will be matched</li>
  <li>the match has to be on the whole string, <em>i.e.</em> <strong>start at the beginning of the string and end at the end of the string</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Okay, but what does each one those parts matches? Keep in mind that <strong>if a match occurs, it means that the number is not prime</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="how-the--regular-expression-works">How The ^.?$ Regular Expression Works</h3>

<p><code>^.?$</code> will match 0 or 1 characters. This match will be successful if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the string contains <strong>only 1 character</strong> - this means that we’re dealing with
number <code>1</code> and, by definition, <code>1</code> <strong>is not prime</strong>.</li>
  <li>the string contains <strong>0 characters</strong> - this means that we’re dealing with
number <code>0</code>, and <code>0</code> is certainly <strong>not prime</strong>, since we can divide <code>0</code> by anything
we want, except for <code>0</code> itself, of course.</li>
</ul>

<p>If we’re given the sting <code>1</code>, <code>^.?$</code> will match it, since we have only one 
character in our string (<code>1</code>). The match will also occur if we provide an empty 
string, since, as explained before, <code>^.?$</code> will match either an empty string (0
characters) or a string with only 1 character.</p>

<p>Okay, so far so so good, we certainly want our regex to recognize <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> as
non-primes. But that’s not enough, since there are numbers other than
<code>0</code> and <code>1</code> that are not prime. This is where the second part of the regular
expression comes in.</p>

<h3 id="how-the-1-regular-expression-works">How The ^(..+?)\1+$ Regular Expression Works</h3>

<p><code>^(..+?)\1+$</code> will first try to match multiples of 2, then multiples of 3, then
multiples of 4, then multiples 5, then multiples of 6 and so on, until the multiple
of the number it tries to match is the length of the string or there is a successful match.</p>

<p>But how does it actually work? Well, let’s dissect it!</p>

<p>Let’s focus on the parentheses now, here we have <code>(..+?)</code> (remember, <code>?</code> just 
makes this expression <a href="https://illya.sh/the-codeumentary-blog/regular-expression-check-if-number-is-prime/greedy-and-non-greedy-quantifiers">non-greedy</a>). Notice
that we have a <code>+</code> here, which means “one or more of the preceding token”.
This regex will first try to match <code>(..)</code> (2 characters), then <code>(...)</code> (3 characters), 
then <code>(....)</code>  (4 characters), and so on, until the length of the string we’re 
matching against is reached or there is a successful match.</p>

<p>After matching for some number of characters (let’s call that number <code>x</code>, the regular expression will try to
see if the string’s length is multiple of <code>x</code>. How does it do that? Well, there’s
a <a href="https://illya.sh/the-codeumentary-blog/regular-expression-check-if-number-is-prime/backref">backreference</a>. This takes us to the second
part of the regex: <code>\1+</code>. Now, <a href="https://illya.sh/the-codeumentary-blog/regular-expression-check-if-number-is-prime/capturing-groups-and-backreferences">as explained before</a>
this will try to repeat the match in <strong>capturing group #1</strong> one or more times (<a href="#the-shocking-lie">actually it’s more “more or one times, I’m lying a little bit”</a>)
This means that first, it will try to match <code>x * 2</code> characters in the string, 
then <code>x * 3</code>, then <code>x * 4</code>, and so on. If it succeeds in any of those matches,
it returns it (and this means that the number <strong>is not</strong> prime). If it fails (it will fail when <code>x * &lt;number&gt;</code> exceeds the length of the string we’re matching against),
it will try the same thing, but with <code>x+1</code> characters, <em>i.e</em>, first <code>(x+1) * 2</code>, 
then <code>(x+1) * 3</code>, then <code>(x+1) * 4</code> and so on (because now the <code>\1+</code> backreference
refers to <code>x+1</code> characters). If the number of characters matched by <code>(..+?)</code> reaches
the <strong>length of the string we’re matching against</strong>, the regex matching process will stop and return a failure. If there is a successful match, it will be returned.</p>

<h3 id="example-time">Example Time</h3>

<p>Now, I’ll sketch some examples to make sure you got everything. I will provide
one example where a regular expression <strong>succeeds</strong> to match and one where it
<strong>fails</strong> to match. Again, <a href="#the-shocking-lie">I’m lying</a> in the order of sub-steps (the nested ones, <em>i.e</em> the ones that have a <code>.</code>, like <code>2.1</code>, <code>3.2</code>, etc), just a little.</p>

<p>As an example of <strong>where a match succeeds</strong>, let’s consider the string <code>111111</code>. The length of the string we’re matching against is <code>6</code>. 
Now, 6 is <strong>not</strong> a prime number, so we expect the regex to succeed with the match. Let’s see
a sketch of how it will work:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> It will try to match <code>^.?$</code>. No luck. The left side of <code>|</code> returns a <strong>failure</strong>
<strong>2.</strong> It try to match <code>^(..+?)\1+$</code> (the right side of <code>|</code>). It begins with <code>(..+?)</code> matching <code>11</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>2.1</strong> The backreference <code>\1+</code> will try to match <code>11</code> twice (<em>i.e</em> <code>1111</code>). No luck.</li>
  <li><strong>2.2</strong> The backreference <code>\1+</code> will try to match <code>11</code> trice (<em>i.e</em> <code>111111</code>). <strong>Success!</strong>. Right side of <code>|</code> returns <strong>success</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Woah, that was fast! Since the right side of <code>|</code> <strong>succeeded</strong>,
our regular expression <strong>succeeds</strong> with the match, which means our number is <strong>not</strong> prime.</p>

<p>As an example of <strong>where a match fails</strong>, let’s consider the string <code>11111</code>. The length of the string we’re matching against is <code>5</code>. 
Now, 5 is a prime number, so we expect the regex to fail to match anything. Let’s see
a sketch of how it will work:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> It will try to match <code>^.?$</code>. No luck. The left side of <code>|</code> returns a <strong>failure</strong>
<strong>2.</strong> It try to match <code>^(..+?)\1+$</code> (the right side of <code>|</code>). It begins with <code>(..+?)</code> matching <code>11</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>2.1</strong> The backreference <code>\1+</code> will try to match <code>11</code> twice (<em>i.e</em> <code>1111</code>). No luck.</li>
  <li><strong>2.2</strong> The backreference <code>\1+</code> will try to match <code>11</code> trice (<em>i.e</em> <code>111111</code>). No luck. <strong>Length of string exceeded</strong> (6 &gt; 5). Backreference returns a <strong>failure</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3.</strong> <code>(..+?)</code> now matches <code>111</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>3.1</strong> The backreference <code>\1+</code> will try to match <code>111</code> twice (<em>i.e</em> <code>111111</code>). No luck. <strong>Length of string exceeded</strong> (6 &gt; 5). Backreference returns a <strong>failure</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4.</strong> <code>(..+?)</code> now matches <code>1111</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>4.1</strong> The backreference <code>\1+</code> will try to match <code>1111</code> twice (<em>i.e</em> <code>11111111</code>). No luck. <strong>Length of string exceeded</strong> (8 &gt; 5). Backreference returns a <strong>failure</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5.</strong> <code>(..+?)</code> now matches <code>11111</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>5.1</strong> The backreference <code>\1+</code> will try to match <code>11111</code> twice (<em>i.e</em> <code>1111111111</code>). No luck. <strong>Length of string exceeded</strong> (10 &gt; 5). Backreference returns a <strong>failure</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5.</strong> <code>(..+?)</code> will try to match <code>1111111</code>. No luck. <strong>Length of string exceeded</strong> (6 &gt; 5). <code>(..+?)</code> returns a <strong>failure</strong>. The right side of <code>|</code> returns a <strong>failure</strong></p>

<p>Now since both sides of <code>|</code> failed to match anything, the regular expression <strong>fails</strong>
to match anything, which means our number is prime.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-the-">What About The ?</h3>

<p>Well, I mentioned that you can ignore the <code>?</code> symbol in the regular expression,
since <strong>it’s there only for performance reasons</strong>, and that’s true, but there is no
need to keep its purpose a mystery, so I’ll explain what it actually does there.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, <code>?</code> makes the preceding <code>+</code> <a href="#greedy-and-non-greedy-quantifiers">non-greedy</a>. What does it mean in practice? 
Let’s say our string is <code>111111111111111</code> (corresponds to the number 15). Let’s call
<code>L</code> the length of the string. In our case, <code>L=15</code>.</p>

<p>With the <code>?</code> present there, <code>+</code> will try to match its preceding token (in this case <code>.</code>) <strong>as few times as possible</strong>. This means that first <code>(..+?)</code> will
try to match <code>..</code>, then <code>...</code>, then <code>....</code> and then <code>.....</code>,
after which our whole regex (<code>^.?$|^(..+?)\1+$</code>) would <strong>succeed</strong>. So first, we’ll be testing the divisibility
by 2, then by 3, then by 4 and then by 5, after which we would have a match.
Notice that the number of steps in <code>(..+?)</code> was <strong>4</strong> (first it matches 2, then 3, then 4 and then 5).</p>

<p>If we omitted the <code>?</code>, <em>i.e</em> if we had <code>(..+)</code>, then it would go the other way around: first it would try to
match <code>...............</code> (the number 15, which is our <code>L</code>), then <code>..............</code> (the number 14, <em>i.e</em> <code>L-1</code>),
and so on until <code>.....</code>, after which the whole regex would <strong>succeed</strong>. Notice
that even though the result was the same as in <code>(..+?)</code>, in <code>(..+)</code> the number of steps was <strong>11</strong>
instead of <strong>4</strong>. By definition, <strong>any divisor of L must be no greater than L/2</strong>, so that means that
means that <strong>8</strong> steps were <strong>absolutely wasted computation</strong>, since first we tested
the divisibility by 15, then 14, then 13, and so on until 5 (we could only
hope for a match from number <strong>7</strong> and downwards, since <code>L/2 = 15/2 = 7.5</code>
and the first integer smaller than <code>7.5</code> is <code>7</code>).</p>

<h2 id="the-shocking-lie">The Shocking Lie</h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, I actually lied in the explanation of how the multiples of a number
are matched. Let’s say we have the string <code>111111111111111</code> (number 15).</p>

<p>The way I explained it before was that the regular expression would begin
to test for divisibility by <code>2</code>. It would do so by first trying to match
<code>2*2</code> characters, then <code>2*3</code>, then <code>2*4</code>, then <code>2*5</code>, then <code>2*6</code>, then <code>2*7</code>,
after which it would fail to match <code>2*8</code>, so it would try its luck with testing
for divisibility by <code>3</code>, by first trying to match for <code>3*2</code> characters, then for
<code>3*3</code> characters, then for <code>3*4</code> and then for <code>3*5</code>, where it would succeed.
This is actually what would happen if the regular expression was <code>^.?$|^(..+?)\1+?$</code>
(notice the <code>?</code> at the end), <em>i.e.</em>, if the <code>+</code>following the backreference was
<a href="#greedy-and-non-greedy-quantifiers">non-greedy</a>.</p>

<p>What actually happens is the opposite. It would still try to test
for the divisibility by <code>2</code>, first, but instead of trying to match for <code>2*2</code> characters,
it would begin with trying to match for <code>2*7</code>, then for <code>2*6</code>, then for <code>2*5</code>,
then for <code>2*4</code>, then for <code>2*3</code> and then for <code>2*2</code>, after which it would fail and, once again,
try its luck with divisibility by <code>3</code>, by first trying to match for <code>3*5</code> characters,
where it would succeed right away.</p>

<p>Notice, that in the second case, which is what happens in reality,
<strong>less steps are required</strong>: <strong>11</strong> in the first case vs <strong>7</strong> in the second (in reality, <strong>both of the cases would require more steps than presented here</strong>,
the goal of this explanation is not count them all, but to transmit the idea of what’s happening in both cases, it’s just a sketch of what’s going on under the hood).
While both versions are <strong>equivalent</strong>, the one explained in this blog post, is more efficient.</p>



<p>Here’s the piece of Java code that started all of this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>isPrime</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>!</span><span>new</span> <span>String</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>char</span><span>[</span><span>n</span><span>]).</span><span>matches</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;.?|(..+?)\\1+&#34;</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>If you remember correctly, I said that due to the peculiarities of the way
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#matches-java.lang.String-">String.matches</a> works in Java, the regular expression that matches
non-prime numbers is not the one in the code example above (<code>.?|(..+?)\1+</code>),
but it’s actually <code>^.?$|^(..+?)\1+$</code>. Why? Well, turns out <code>String.matches()</code>
<strong>matches on the whole string</strong>, not on any substring of the string.
Basically, it “automatically inserts” all of the <code>^</code> and <code>$</code> present in the regex 
I explained in this post.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a way not to force the match on the whole string in Java, you can use
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html">Pattern</a>, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html">Matcher</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Matcher.html#find--">Matcher.find()</a> method.</p>

<p>Other than that, it’s pretty much self explanatory: if the match succeeds, then
the number is <strong>not</strong> prime. In case of a successful match, <code>String.matches()</code>
returns <code>true</code> (number is <strong>not</strong> prime), otherwise, it return <code>false</code> (number is prime),
so to obtain the desired functionality we negate what the method returns.</p>

<p><code>new String(new char[n])</code> returns a <code>String</code>of <code>n</code> null characters (the <code>.</code> in our regex matches them).</p>



<p>Now, as promised, it’s time for some code examples!</p>

<h2 id="java">Java</h2>

<p>Although I already presented this code example twice in this post,
I’ll do it here again, just to keep it organized.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="java"><span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>isPrime</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>!</span><span>new</span> <span>String</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>char</span><span>[</span><span>n</span><span>]).</span><span>matches</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;.?|(..+?)\\1+&#34;</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="python">Python</h2>

<p>I’ve <a href="https://illya.sh/the-codeumentary-blog/why-you-should-learn-python/">expressed my sympathy for Python before</a>, so of course I have to include
this one here.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>is_prime</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>):</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>not</span> <span>re</span><span>.</span><span>match</span><span>(</span><span>r&#39;^.?$|^(..+?)</span><span>\</span><span>1+$&#39;</span><span>,</span> <span>&#39;1&#39;</span><span>*</span><span>n</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="javascript">JavaScript</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Java is to JavaScript as car is to carpet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a joke I like. I didn’t come up with it and I don’t really know its
first source, so I don’t know whom to credit. Anyways, I’m actually going to
give you two versions here, one which works in <a href="https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features">ES6</a>
and one that works in previous versions.</p>

<p>First, the ECMAScript 6 version:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>isPrime</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>re</span> <span>=</span> <span>/^.</span><span>?</span><span>$|^</span><span>(</span><span>..+</span><span>?)\1</span><span>+$/</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>!</span><span>re</span><span>.</span><span>test</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;1&#39;</span><span>.</span><span>repeat</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The feature that’s only available in ECMAScript 6 is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/repeat">String.prototype.repeat()</a>
method.</p>

<p>If you gotta use previous versions of ES, you can always fall back to
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join">Array.prototype.join()</a>.
Note, however, that we’re passing <code>n+1</code> to <code>join()</code>, since it actually
places those characters <strong>in between</strong> array elements. So if we have, let’s say,
<code>10</code> array elements, there are only <code>9</code> “in-betweens”. Here’s the version
that will work in versions prior to ECMAScript 6:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>function</span> <span>isPrime</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>re</span> <span>=</span> <span>/^.</span><span>?</span><span>$|^</span><span>(</span><span>..+</span><span>?)\1</span><span>+$/</span><span>;</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>!</span><span>re</span><span>.</span><span>test</span><span>(</span><span>Array</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>+</span><span>1</span><span>).</span><span>join</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;1&#39;</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="perl">Perl</h2>

<p>Last, but not least, it’s time for Perl. I’m including this here because the
regular expression we’ve been exploring in this blog post has been popularized
by Perl. I’m talking about the one-liner <code>perl -wle &#39;print &#34;Prime&#34; if (1 x shift) !~ /^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/&#39; &lt;number&gt;</code>
(replace <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> with an actual number).</p>

<p>Also, since I haven’t played around with Perl before, this seemed like a good
opportunity to do so. So here we go:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>sub</span> <span>is_prime</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>!</span><span>((</span><span>1</span><span>x$_</span><span>[</span><span>0</span><span>])</span> <span>=~</span> <span>/^.</span><span>?</span><span>$|^</span><span>(</span><span>..+</span><span>?)\1</span><span>+$/</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Since Perl isn’t the most popular language right now, it might happen that
you’re not familiar with its syntax. Now, I’ve had about 15 mins with it, so
I’m pretty much an expert, so I’ll take the liberty to briefly explain the
syntax above:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>sub</code> - defines a new subroutine (function)</li>
  <li><code>$_[0]</code> - we’re accessing the first parameter passed in to our subroutine</li>
  <li><code>1x&lt;number&gt;</code> - here we’re using the repetition operator <code>x</code>, this will
basically repeat the number <code>1</code> <code>&lt;number&gt;</code> of times and return the result as a string.
This is similar to what <code>&#39;1&#39;*&lt;number&gt;</code> would do in Python or <code>&#39;1&#39;.repeat(&lt;number&gt;)</code>
in JavaScript.</li>
  <li><code>=~</code> is the match test operator, it will return true if the regular expression
(its right-hand side) has a match on the string (its left-hand side).</li>
  <li><code>!</code> is the negation operator</li>
</ul>

<p>I included this brief explanation, because, I myself, don’t like being left
in mystery about what a certain passage of code does and the explanation didn’t
take up much space anyways.</p>



<p>That’s all folks! Hopefully, you’re now demystified about how a regular expression
can check if a number is prime. Keep in mind, that this is far from efficient,
there are a lot more efficient algorithms for this task,
but it is, nonetheless, a fun and interesting thing.</p>

<p>I encourage you to go to a website like <a href="https://regex101.com/">regex101</a> and
play around, specially if you’re still not 100% clear about how everything
explained here works. One of the cool things about this website is that
it includes an explanation of the regular expression (column on the right),
as well as the number of steps the regex engine had to make (rectangle right above
the modifiers box) - it’s a good way to see the performance differences (through the number of steps taken)
in the greedy and non-greedy cases.</p>
