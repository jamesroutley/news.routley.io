A red diffusion is a similar request but is only sent to individual countries.</p><p>Pestrikov found he was named in a red diffusion after he fled Russia in June 2022 - four months after the invasion of Ukraine - and applied for asylum in France.</p><p>He felt he had two options: &#34;Go to the police and say, &#39;I&#39;m in the Interpol system,&#39;&#34; and risk arrest or lie low. This may mean &#34;you can&#39;t rent an apartment, your bank accounts get blocked&#34;, which is what happened to him, he says.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s constant nerves, all the time,&#34; he adds, explaining he was always looking over his shoulder. For safety, his daughter and her mother moved to another country.  The police can &#34;break into your house at any time… that&#39;s why you&#39;re like a cornered rat&#34;, he says.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s the stress, the nerves, the pressure, the lawlessness inflicted on you,&#34; that breaks families apart, he adds.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Pestrikov had been a major shareholder in large metals companies in Russia that were privatised in the 1990s, most notably Solikamsk Magnesium Plant.</p><p>In the months leading up to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, he says government ministers pressured him to stop selling his products abroad and only supply the Russian market. He believed this would mean his products could be used to make components for military hardware, such as fighter jets and tanks.</p><p>He says it wasn&#39;t just that he was against &#34;having to sell much cheaper and to whoever the ministries told me to&#34; but that &#34;it was a moral issue as well... no-one wanted to get involved even indirectly in the production of something used to kill people&#34;.</p><p>Pestrikov believes his refusal to comply and the fact his wife at the time was Ukrainian led to his companies being nationalised and to Russia investigating him for financial crimes.</p><p>After he fled to France, he was worried that the Kremlin might try to target him there, so he contacted Interpol and was told about the red diffusion request, which had passed the agency&#39;s checks.</p><p>Pestrikov decided to challenge it through Interpol&#39;s internal, independent watchdog, the Commission for the Control of Interpol&#39;s Files (CCF), arguing that Russia&#39;s request was politically motivated.</p><p>Interpol&#39;s constitution expressly states that the organisation cannot be used &#34;to undertake any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character&#34;.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2d27/live/4ba93200-f87f-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="ARIS MESSINIS/AFP via Getty Images A firefighter is standing on a ladder next to a light grey multi-storey building which has white smoke pouring out of it.

This goes against Interpol advice that members should not use its channels in this way.</p><p>The leak also contains a message about Armen Aramyan, a journalist who had fled Russia after he was convicted of &#34;engaging minors in dangerous activities&#34; for reporting on student protests that supported the opposition leader Alexei Navalny in January 2021.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20260113-125315-2e65791d43-web-2.37.1-4/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/ed2e/live/93f21280-f851-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/ed2e/live/93f21280-f851-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed2e/live/93f21280-f851-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/ed2e/live/93f21280-f851-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/ed2e/live/93f21280-f851-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/ed2e/live/93f21280-f851-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/ed2e/live/93f21280-f851-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ed2e/live/93f21280-f851-11f0-b5f7-49f0357294ff.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Aleksey Fokin/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images A row of police officers, wearing black uniforms with riot shields, helmets and protective leg gear, stretches across a street in a town centre.

And yet, in the same period, the CCF was overturning roughly half of all Russian requests that it received complaints about. This raises questions about whether the measures had been stringent enough.</p><p>One report describes how in 2024 Russia attempted to place red diffusions on judges and a prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, after the body issued arrest warrants for President Vladimir Putin and another government official for their actions in Ukraine. These requests from Moscow were rejected.</p><p>Even while concerns about Russia&#39;s misuse of Interpol&#39;s systems were being expressed inside the organisation, the reports also show that discussions were taking place in 2024 and 2025 about whether to remove additional restrictions on Russian activity.</p><p>This seems to have been settled in Moscow&#39;s favour. The whistleblower told the BBC that in 2025 Interpol quietly dropped some extra measures against Russia — it is not clear how far this softening may have gone. Despite repeated requests, Interpol said it was not able to comment due to its &#34;strict rules on the processing of data&#34;.</p><p>The BBC was unable to disclose all the details of the leak to Interpol as doing so could reveal the source. However, when asked about the issues raised in the investigation, Interpol said it was &#34;concerned that a number of the accusations seems to come from a misunderstanding of how Interpol and CCF systems work, or factual errors about data and changes within Interpol&#39;s systems&#34;.</p><p>&#34;It is untrue to say that we prioritise police co-operation over preventing abuse – Interpol follows its constitution that expressly forbids the use of our systems on information that is of a predominantly political, military, religious or racial character.&#34;</p><p>And in the past, it has said it can do more good to prevent crimes by ensuring that lines of communication remain open.</p><p>We asked Russia&#39;s ministry of internal affairs for comment, but it did not respond.</p><p>Lawyers Yuriy Nemets and Ben Keith agree that Interpol should do more to prevent misuse of its systems. &#34;If countries are found to be significantly and persistently abusing red notices and diffusions, then they should be suspended from the system for a period of time,&#34; says Keith.</p><p>Otherwise, Igor Pestrikov fears that Russia, &#34;with the push of a button, can enter anything, pin any crime on you - this lets them persecute you further around the world&#34;.</p><p><i id="additional-reporting:-andreea-jitaru-and-ned-davies"><b id="additional-reporting:-andreea-jitaru-and-ned-davies">Additional reporting: Andreea Jitaru and Ned Davies</b></i></p></div></article></div>
