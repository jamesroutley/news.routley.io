    <h1>Stop postponing things by embracing the mess</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/embrace_mess_small.png" alt="Stop postponing things by embracing the mess"/></p><p>Does your day get derailed frequently because of unexpected circumstances?</p><p>Do you always expect yourself to be more productive tomorrow?</p><p>Do you think you will have more time in the future?</p><p>Let&#39;s dive into why, and what to do about it.</p><h2 id="today-is-far-from-perfect-but-tomorrow-will-be-better"><strong>Today is far from perfect, but tomorrow will be better</strong></h2><p>Our brain simplifies the future to a large extent.</p><p>We think tomorrow will solve our problems. That tomorrow we&#39;ll have time to do everything. Or just more time, anyway. Tomorrow, change will be easier.</p><p>But it often isn&#39;t. Tomorrow becomes today, and <strong>today is a mess.</strong></p><p>Today, we&#39;re hungry. Today, someone is late. Today, we don&#39;t feel like taking on the work.</p><p><strong>Today doesn&#39;t line up with how we imagined it to be: this magical land of improved productivity.</strong></p><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" data-src="/assets/illustrations/tomorrow_expectations_vs_reality.png" alt="Tomorrow - expectations vs reality" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></p><p><strong>This is normal.</strong></p><p>The problem is that the simplified image of &#34;productive tomorrow&#34; forms our expectations and when we fail these expectations, we beat ourselves up.</p><p>And we procrastinate because each of these imperfections, these deviations from our imagined day, gives us an opportunity to justify getting distracted.</p><p>We wake up late, and so we feel justified in checking social media. We say &#34;What the hell&#34;. A meeting is canceled, and suddenly we feel like we have &#34;bonus time&#34; to scroll Twitter for 30 minutes. We don&#39;t do our perfect routine, and so we don&#39;t feel ready to tackle the most important work on our plate.</p><p>This attitude makes us fragile. <strong>Almost every day has a bunch of these imperfections</strong>. If we treat each of them as a reason to get side-tracked, we&#39;ll procrastinate the whole day.</p><p>A change in attitude is needed.</p><h2 id="embrace-the-mess-instead"><strong>Embrace the mess instead</strong></h2><p>Accept that the perfect moment is not coming. You won&#39;t magically feel super-motivated. You won&#39;t suddenly start to focus for 2 hours at a time.</p><p>You have only what you have right now. If you feel okay-ish, and you have 30 minutes of largely uninterrupted time, now&#39;s the time to do something.</p><p>Expect things to not go 100% according to plan.</p><p>Wake up late? Reset.</p><p>If you know that these imperfections are extremely likely, you can react with more presence of mind and make the best of the situation.</p><p>For example, I write this on the train, late to my dentist appointment because it snowed overnight. Hardly an ideal situation, and yet I write. I could easily justify to myself that I should do nothing and fret over how bad this situation is (and I indeed did for about 10 minutes), but I still have 30 minutes of the train ride and so why not do a bit of work?</p><p>If I hadn&#39;t written anything on that train, I wouldn&#39;t have had a place to continue. I wouldn&#39;t have anything to edit, to improve, and to share.</p><p>Because of my attitude to make the best out of the situation, however messy it was, I was somewhat productive, and felt better about how I spent my time as a result.</p><p>Now, I&#39;m far from perfect in this regard, but it&#39;s a skill I&#39;m working on. With that in mind, let&#39;s take a look at some principles to make this mindset shift easier.</p><h2 id="dont-be-precious-about-routines"><strong>Don&#39;t be precious about routines</strong></h2><p>The ideal morning routine, the ideal evening routine, the ideal workout routine,...</p><p>These can all become shackles and make us fragile. They don&#39;t take the mess of life into account. Any interruption derails the whole thing, giving us a reason to procrastinate.</p><p>If you have time for a nice routine, sure, go for it. But don&#39;t rely on it too much. Accept that sometimes it won&#39;t be possible to follow the routine.</p><h2 id="dont-be-precious-about-work"><strong>Don&#39;t be precious about work</strong></h2><p>A lot of people who procrastinate start to view work as a huge enemy. It&#39;s driven largely by how they approached work in the past. They procrastinated, and then near the deadline they had to do 8 hours of work in one day—so now every even mildly unpleasant task looks like that 8 hour behemoth. And so, procrastination follows.</p><p>In reality, almost no task requires an 8 hour sprint. If we don&#39;t procrastinate, we can work in much easier 15-30 minute chunks. 8 hour sprints are overwhelming, 30 minute chunks less so.</p><p>And the key thing is that you don&#39;t need the perfect &#34;priming routine&#34; to get into flow. 30 minutes of work can be done in many different settings, in many different mental states.</p><p>Do a bit of work here, a bit of work there,... and it begins to add up. Of course, you can do more if you want to.</p><p>Blowing work out of proportion, and demonizing it is a bad habit.</p><p>&#34;I have to do this.&#34;</p><p>All of the above only make it harder to do the task.</p><p>Try to view work as a series of small steps, a couple of which you can take today, instead of a big push.</p><h2 id="dont-expect-your-focus-to-be-perfect"><strong>Don&#39;t expect your focus to be perfect</strong></h2><p>When you do sit down to work, don&#39;t expect 100% unwavering focus.</p><p>You&#39;ll probably start at around 50%. You&#39;ll still feel a bit distracted.</p><p>But if you continue, after 10-15 min you&#39;ll get more focused.</p><p>At the end of the session, your focus will go back down.</p><p>Our concentration level changes throughout the work session. Sometimes we are more engaged, sometimes less. What matters is not getting side-tracked in moments of waning concentration. Expect this, stare out of a window for a moment, but don&#39;t grab the phone or open a new tab.</p><h2 id="think-about-productivity-as-a-spectrum"><strong>Think about productivity as a spectrum</strong></h2><p>You&#39;re not 0% productive or 100% productive. Viewing productivity as a 0 or 1 switch is not helpful. How many of us feel like we&#39;re at 100%? Very few.</p><p>Having the expectation of being 100% productive will only lead to failure, because no day is perfect.</p><p>However, expecting yourself to be at least 50% productive? That is achievable and when you do achieve it, you feel better, making you more productive later.</p><p>So, could you be at least 50% productive today? Aim for that. If you do better, great. If not, have the same goal tomorrow.</p><h2 id="look-for-imperfect-actions-in-the-right-direction"><strong>Look for imperfect actions in the right direction</strong></h2><p>There is no perfect action.</p><p>When we think about a project, we&#39;re tempted to look for the perfect way to start. If we only started perfectly, then we couldn&#39;t fail, and so our ego would be perfectly protected.</p><p>That&#39;s not how things work.</p><p>Most human accomplishment is a sum of a bunch of trial and error. In other words, a lot of imperfect attempts that sometimes yield good results.</p><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=" data-src="/assets/illustrations/failure_iceberg.png" alt="More attempts more success" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"/></p><p>This doesn&#39;t mean that we should not look for good ways to approach our work, it simply means that when we&#39;re stuck, <strong>any action will be better than no action.</strong></p><p>So next time you start working, and what you produce doesn&#39;t seem perfect like you imagine it to be, continue. Don&#39;t stop. Keep working.</p><p>Each task we tackle, each minute we put in, will solidify our intention and help us better understand the task at hand. Often, we don&#39;t even know what a good approach would look like before we start.</p><p>Imperfect action &gt; perfect nothing.</p><h2 id="summary"><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>Everyday life is not perfect. It&#39;s more complicated than we imagine it to be.</p><p>Don&#39;t expect your routines to go perfectly.</p><p>Don&#39;t expect your concentration to be laser-focused 100% of the work session, and especially not at the start.</p><p>Don&#39;t look for the perfect ways to start, start anywhere you can.</p></article></div>
