    <h1>America&#39;s dramatic shift from gas power plants to batteries</h1>

<p>Big batteries are eating the lunch of gas-fired power plants in the US, new data shows.</p>



<p>Gas has long been the technology of choice for balancing America’s power grids and facilitating the shift from coal. In 2023, gas facilities accounted for 43.1% of total utility-scale generation in the country, per the Energy Information Administration (EIA). That’s up from 27.7% just a decade before.</p>



<p>But recent statistics from the EIA show that developers and power plant owners now overwhelmingly favour batteries as a source of dispatchable power. And the shift has been brisk.</p>



<p>In 2020, gas plants accounted for 21% of all new electrical capacity brought onto the grid. In 2024, however, the fossil fuel’s share of new additions is expected to slump to 4%, with just 2.5GW of new capacity set to come online — the lowest level in 25 years.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the share of new battery storage capacity has surged from 1% in 2020 to an anticipated 23% this year, with 14.3GW set to come online.</p>

<p>And there are indications that gas’ share of new projects will continue to decline.</p>



<p>Data collated by Berkeley Lab shows that of the 2.6 terawatts of energy projects seeking grid connections in the US, gas accounts for just 2.6% of potential additions. Standalone batteries, and projects with battery components, comprise nearly two-thirds of the total pipeline.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, some existing gas-fired power plants are being muscled out, too, as batteries that can take advantage of arbitrage opportunities gain the upper hand on the economic front.</p>



<p>An 800MW Californian gas plant, commissioned in 2008, was recently demolished to make way for a 680MW, four-hour battery storage system, which will charge up on excess solar power during the day and feed back into the grid when demand and prices are high.</p>



<p>In the Golden State, batteries already frequently provide more instantaneous power than gas during evening peak periods. </p>

Graphic: California’s independent system operator.</em></figcaption></figure>







<p>That’s helping to reduce system costs.</p>



<p>California’s system operator said recently its ancillary service costs in the third quarter of 2023 were down 45% from a year before partly thanks to the “increased participation of battery storage resources.”</p>



<p>“This stunning growth in battery deployment means that moving forward, utilities will be able to bring online even more renewable energy — such as solar or wind — without relying as much on natural gas,” the Council of Economic Advisers, an agency that advises the US president, said in a new analysis.</p>



<p>It referenced EIA data showing that through 2024, wind, solar and batteries will account for 94% of all new electrical capacity in the US. Nuclear will comprise another 2% of total additions.</p>



<p><strong>Yes, but:</strong> There remains a long way to go to decarbonise the US power system.</p>



<p>In 2024, gas will likely hold a 42% share of the electricity mix, followed by renewables at 24%, nuclear at 19%, and coal at 15%, <a href="https://theprogressplaybook.com/2023/12/13/solar-and-wind-to-surpass-coal-in-the-us-from-2024/">the EIA says</a>.</p>



<p>The US government aims to get to 80% renewable-based electricity by 2030, and a 100% carbon-free power system by 2035. </p>



<p>“While there is still plenty of existing fossil fuel capacity across the US, this increase in new capacity from battery storage is an important milestone toward a fully clean power grid,” the Council of Economic Advisers says.</p>



<p>The council credits the Inflation Reduction Act for galvanising the shift to solar, wind and batteries.</p>



<p>Among other things, the legislation provides generous <a href="https://www.epa.gov/green-power-markets/summary-inflation-reduction-act-provisions-related-renewable-energy">investment tax credits</a> for utility-scale battery storage systems. </p>



<p>Since it came into law, domestic manufacturing investments in battery production — for both grid scale and EV batteries — have <a href="https://www.cleaninvestmentmonitor.org/">increased</a> from $2.3 billion to $9.9 billion, according to the Clean Investment Monitor. </p>



<p>“These policies will supercharge battery deployment in the coming years, particularly as two ongoing trends continue to increase the demand for batteries,” the Council of Economic Advisers says. </p>



<p>“First, increasing electrification of the economy, from electric vehicles to heat pumps, is increasing electricity demand for the first time <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/electricity/sub-topic-01.php">in over a decade</a>. </p>



<p>“Second, even without increases in overall electricity demand, there are moments in places such as in <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=60822">California</a> and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/electricity/markets/quarterly/archive/2023/transmission_limits_07_2023.pdf">Texas</a> where excess supply of zero-carbon, zero-marginal cost renewable electricity must be turned away from the grid. This curtailment of renewable energy is <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=57100">expected</a> to grow. Batteries can absorb excess clean power, simultaneously meeting greater electricity demand and enabling accelerated power sector decarbonisation.”</p>
