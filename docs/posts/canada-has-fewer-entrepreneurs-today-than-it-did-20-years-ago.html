Its recommendation: Some of the difficulties of entrepreneurship can be overcome by helping business owners develop &#34;soft skills,&#34; such as grit, marketing and how to interact with people.</p><p dir="ltr">BDC, a financial institution for entrepreneurs that provides loans for small and medium-sized businesses, released the report for <a href="https://www.bdc.ca/en/small-business-week"><u>Small Business Week</u></a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Why entrepreneurship is down</h2><p>For its report, BDC defined an entrepreneur as a self-employed worker who hires employees to support their venture.</p><p>&#34;Twenty years ago, there was three Canadians in 1,000 every year becoming an entrepreneur,&#34; Pierre Cléroux, BDC&#39;s chief economist, told CBC News. &#34;Now we&#39;re down to about one for every 1,000 people.&#34;</p><p>The actual figure is 1.3 people for every 1,000, less than half the rate of two decades ago.</p><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A man with brown hair and glasses wearing a blue blazer speaks in front of projector screen in a classroom.

He says the entrepreneurship decline &#39;simply can&#39;t be ignored,&#39; because new businesses are responsible for &#39;almost all net new job creation in this country.&#39; <!-- --> <!-- -->(Université de Montréal)</figcaption></figure></div><p>It&#39;s also far below the apparent public interest in entrepreneurship.</p><p>The popularity of TV shows like <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/dragonsden"><u>Dragons&#39; Den</u></a>, the growth of college and university entrepreneurship programs, and the creation of business incubators for entrepreneurs across Canada all suggest the appeal of starting a business.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gemconsortium.org/reports/latest-global-report"><u>report by Global Entrepreneurship Monitor</u></a> says 14 per cent of Canada&#39;s population has entrepreneurial aspirations; so there seems to be plenty of dreamers. Yet BDC says few of those dreamers are becoming doers for several reasons:</p><ul>   <li>People in their late 20s to early 40s are the most likely to start businesses, but that demographic is shrinking with Canada&#39;s aging population, leaving a smaller pool of candidates as potential founders.</li>   <li>Low unemployment and high wages mean fewer people feel the need to start a new business.</li>   <li>Business owners and would-be entrepreneurs face a barrage of discouraging factors, such as labour shortages, inflation, technological change and the increasing domination of large companies.<strong> </strong></li>  </ul><h2 dir="ltr">Why it matters </h2><p>Cléroux said the entrepreneurship decline &#34;simply can&#39;t be ignored,&#34; because new businesses are responsible for &#34;almost all net new job creation in this country.&#34;</p><p>He said that &#34;in any healthy economy, you need a good percentage of startups&#34; to bring new products and services to market and &#34;force mature businesses to do better.&#34;</p><p>Sarah Lubik, director of entrepreneurship at the Beedie School of Business at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, agrees.</p><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A woman with grey blond hair in a ponytail wearing a black wool jacket with fancy silver buttons and a large lapel stands with her arms crossed in front of wall covered in green and brown fall foliage.

BDC recommends a focus on developing &#34;soft skills&#34; to help entrepreneurs through every stage of business.</p><p>Based on a survey of 1,250 entrepreneurs,<em> </em>it says marketing and finance skills are key to help a business get started, while administration and operations skills are needed to keep it going, and leadership and people skills are essential to create growth.</p><p>Relationship skills and grit — the ability to deal with stress, handle change and overcome setbacks — stood out as important in every stage of business.</p><p>The BDC report stresses that key skills are not innate personality characteristics, but traits and behaviours that can be learned through coaching and mentorship, reading, formal classes and engagement with peers.</p><p>Dominic Lim, an associate professor of entrepreneurship at Western University&#39;s Ivey Business School in London, Ont., says successful entrepreneurs evolve and learn to cover for weaknesses.</p><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="As Asian man wearing a black suit jacket and blue dress shirt leans against a wall in front of a set of stone stairs.
