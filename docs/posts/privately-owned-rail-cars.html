	<p>Amtrak provides the ability for rail/train car owners to have their privately-owned rail/train cars attached to our trains between specified locations to see North America in an extraordinary way. We also provide many services, including 480v standby power, water, ice, septic, car wash, parking, and switching.</p>
<p>The charges to the owner of the private car include an annual registration fee, concurrent with the annual PC-1 inspection, as well as a mileage rate based on the number of cars on that particular movement request and other charges based on the services requested.</p>

	<p>Amtrak offers parking for Private Railroad Cars at select facilities.  To request parking for your car, download, complete and submit the <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/content/dam/projects/dotcom/english/public/documents/privatecars/Amtrak-Private-Car-Parking-Permit-102621.pdf" target="_blank">Private Car Parking Permit</a>.</p>
<p>The Amtrak Charter &amp; Special Moves department will document and process each request, working with the private car owner and the local Amtrak facility where parking is requested.  Once it is determined that the agreement can be approved, an Amtrak Charter &amp; Special Moves staff member will be available to assist the private car owner with the move request to the specified location for parking.</p>
<p>Private Car owners will be billed accordingly by Amtrak for services rendered.</p>

	<h4>Parking Updates</h4>
<p>All customers covered with a parking agreement for any location receive a 15% discount on the daily parking rate at their non-home facilities during a move. See the parking agreement for terms and location restrictions.<br/>
</p>
<p>Long Term Parking for all locations has been reduced from a six (6) month commitment to a three (3) month commitment. The parking agreement permit has been amended to indicate this change.</p>
