    <h1>A podcast about the xz backdoor with the guy who found it</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>On this week’s show Patrick and Adam discuss the week’s security news, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The SSH backdoor that dreams (or nightmares) are made of</li>
  <li>Microsoft gets a solid spanking from the CSRB</li>
  <li>Ukraine uses an old Russian WinRAR bug to hack Russia</li>
  <li>Push-notifications and social-engineering combined-arms vs Apple</li>
  <li>And much, much more.</li>
</ul>

<p>We have a special guest in this week’s show, Andres Freund, the Postgres developer who discovered the backdoor in the xz Linux compression library.</p>

<p>This week’s show is brought to you by Island, a company that makes a security-focussed enterprise browser. Island’s Bradon Rogers is this week’s sponsor guest and he’ll be joining us to talk about how people are swapping out their Virtual Desktop Infrastructure for enterprise-focussed browsers like theirs.</p>
