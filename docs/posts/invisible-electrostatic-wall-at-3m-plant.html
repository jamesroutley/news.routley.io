    <h1>Invisible Electrostatic Wall at 3M plant</h1>

  Problems: coulomb forces would be expected to <i>attract</i> a person
  into the &#34;chamber&#34; formed by the PP film, and the attractive force
  should increase linearly across distance. There should be no &#34;wall&#34; in
  the center, a discrete wall is repulsive, also nonlinear.<br/></p>

<p>If for some reason a
  person was repelled from the center of the chamber rather than being
  attracted, there still should be no &#34;wall,&#34; since the repulsion force 
should exist over a large distance; it
  should act like a deep pillow which exerts more and more force as one
  moves deeper into it.  Large fuzzy fields, this is how
  magnets and iron behave, and this is how e-fields and conductive objects
  should also behave.
<br/></p>

<p>

  A thought: unspooling of film typically generates a much higher net 
charge on
  the long piece of film than on the small surface of the spool.
  However, since charge is created in pairs, and net charge is conserved, 
the imbalances of charge <i>must</i> 
be
  equal and opposite.  The charge on the entire length of moving film 
<i>must</i>
  be equal in magnitude to the charge on the spool.  Yet the charge on the
  film is very large and is continuously increasing.  The limited
  surface-charge on the spool required that opposite charge is being 
<i>lost
  through some unseen path.</i>  
<br/></p>

<p>
Very probably the spool is spewing out 
enormous quantities of ionized air with polarity opposite that of the 
charge on the moving plastic film.
<br/></p>

<p>

  Charged air would be created by discharge in the cleft between film and 
spool as the 
film
  was peeled from the spool.  I wonder if film was being peeled from the 
top of
  the spool, so that any ionized air created in the cleft would be 
launched into the
&#34;tent-chamber&#34; region?  (If it was peeled from the bottom of the spool,
the charged air would end up outside the &#34;tent.&#34;)  Or, if a corona
discharge arises in the cleft between film and spool, perhaps the UV and
e-fields of this corona can ionize the air on both sides of the exiting
plastic film, and spray the charged air everywhere. 
<br/></p>

<p>

  So, if the charged &#34;tent&#34; of film is negative in the above situation,
  and if a large quantity of positively charged air is being generated
  by the spool, then perhaps the &#34;invisible wall&#34; is caused by a cloud of
  suspended air ions held in position by e-fields.  Perhaps it&#39;s a 
pressure gradient created by
  ionized air trapped under the tent by electrostatic attraction.  Yet
  again this effect would be expected to create a diffuse zone of 
increasing
  force, not a &#34;wall&#34;, but an &#34;invisible pillow.&#34;  Added note: concrete 
floors behave as conductors (resistors) in this situation.  Where 
megavolts at 
microamps are involved, the division between insulators and conductors is 
at 10^6/10^-6 =  1000 gigaohms.  Concrete resistivity is 
in the realm of megohms, so it behaves like a grounded metal sheet. 
<br/></p>

<p>

  However, a volume of charged air is somewhat analogous to iron
  filings near a magnet.  If a solid sheet of iron filings is held in
  place by a magnet, then a literal &#34;wall&#34; is created, and this wall will
  resist penetration by nonferrous objects.  If in the above manufacturing
  plant, a sheet of highly charged air is for some reason being held in
  place by the fields created by the charged film, then a transparent
  &#34;wall&#34; made of charged air would come into being.  It might produce 
pressures on surfaces, and resist  penetration by human bodies. 
<br/></p>

<p>

  My question is this: if the entire situation could be turned on its
  side, so the &#34;invisible wall&#34; became an &#34;invisible floor&#34;, could a
  person *<i>stand</i>* on it?  Have we discovered the long-sought &#34;Zero-G
  waterbed?&#34;  :)    - B.B.
