    <h1>Ask HN: Can you recommend an “instant-switch” Monitor? Does one exist?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Current situation:
- I have three sources connected to my monitor (1 HDMI, 1 DP, 1 USB C).
- The monitor is on a switched off source i.e. due power save mode.
- When I try to switch to another source, it takes 4 seconds or more to switch</p><p>What the monitor should do: S
- Switch instantly no matter if the current source is on or not.</p><p>WHY the long delay???
It is really something that angers me.every.damn.time.</p><p>I have a Dell U2723QE, but older models have that as well as others from other brands.</p><p>Would love to get a recommendation for an instant switch model.</p></div></div></div>
