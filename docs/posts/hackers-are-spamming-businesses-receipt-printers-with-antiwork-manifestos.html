Although hilarious, I’d like it to stop,” one Reddit post read. Another one read: “I’ve received about 4 different messages at random times over the last week at work. Very inspiring, encouraging, and fun to see my bosses face when he has to rip them off the printer.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Love r/antiwork but please stop spamming my receipt printer,” another post read. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Some people on Reddit have suggested that the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r35fee/so_people_were_complaining_about_fake_texts_now/" target="_blank"><span>messages are fake</span></a> (i.e. printed by people with access to a receipt printer and posted for Reddit clout) or as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/r325jg/receipt_printing_conspiracy_ive_seen_several/" target="_blank"><span>part of a conspiracy </span></a>to make it seem like the r/antiwork subreddit is doing something illegal. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>But Andrew Morris, the founder of GreyNoise, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xpbva/greynoise-internet-scanning-noise"><span>a cybersecurity firm that monitors the internet</span></a>, told Motherboard that his firm has seen actual network traffic going to insecure receipt printers, and that it seems someone or multiple people are sending these printing jobs all over the internet indiscriminately, as if spraying or blasting them all over. Morris has a history of <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zmdy7y/someone-is-selling-mass-print-hijacking-hacking-service"><span>catching hackers exploiting insecure printers</span></a>. </p></span><span></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“Someone is using a similar technique as ‘mass scanning’ to massively blast raw TCP data directly to printer services across the internet,” Morris told Motherboard in an online chat. “Basically to every single device that has port TCP 9100 open and print a pre-written document that references /r/antiwork with some workers rights/counter capitalist messaging.” </p></span></p><div data-component="ImageBlock"><div><div><picture><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1638479286549-anti-work-manifesto.jpeg?resize=20:*"/><source media="(min-width: 700px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1638479286549-anti-work-manifesto.jpeg?resize=20:*"/><source media="(min-width: 0px)" srcset="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1638479286549-anti-work-manifesto.jpeg?resize=20:*"/><img alt="anti-work-manifesto.jpeg"/></picture></div></div></div><p><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>Whoever is doing this, Morris said, is doing it “in an intelligent way.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“The person or people behind this are distributing the mass-print from 25 separate servers so blocking one IP isn&#39;t enough,” he said.</p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>“A technical person is broadcasting print requests for a document containing workers rights messaging to all printers that are misconfigured to be exposed to the internet and we&#39;ve confirmed that it is printing successfully in some number of places the exact number would be difficult to confirm but Shodan suggests that thousands of printers are exposed,” he added, referring to Shodan, a tool that scans the internet for insecure computers, servers, and other devices. </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>There is a long history of hackers exploiting insecure printers. In fact, it’s a classic hack. A few years ago, a hacker made printers <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mbyyay/hacker-promoting-pewdiepie-stops-hacking-because-of-harassment"><span>print out promotions for the YouTube channel of the controversial influence PewDiePie</span></a>. In 2017, another hacker made printers spit out a message where they were bragging and calling themselves “the hacker god.” </p></span><span data-component="TextBlock"><p>If you know who is behind this, or you are the person doing this, please reach out.
