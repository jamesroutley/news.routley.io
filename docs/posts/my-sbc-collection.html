    <h1>My SBC Collection</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Like many computer nerds in the last decade, I have accumulated more than a few single-board computers, or “SBCs”, which are small computers based around a system-on-a-chip (SoC) that nearly always features an ARM CPU at its core. Surprisingly few of these units are Raspberry Pi units, though that brand has come to exemplify and dominate the product category.</p>
<p>Also, as is the case for many computer nerds, most of these SBCs lay fallow for years at a time. Combined with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbox">an inexpensive lightbox</a> that I procured in the last year, I decided I could at least create glamour shots of various units and catalog them in a blog post.</p>
<p>While Raspberry Pi still enjoys the most mindshare far and away, and while I do have a few Raspberry Pi units in my inventory, I have always been a bigger fan of <a href="https://www.hardkernel.com/">the ODROID brand</a>, which works with convenient importers around the world (in the USA, I can vouch for <a href="https://ameridroid.com/">Ameridroid</a>, to whom I’ve forked over a fair amount of cash for these computing toys).</p>
<p>As mentioned, Raspberry undisputedly has the most mindshare of all these SBC brands and I often wonder why… and then I immediately remind myself that it has the biggest ecosystem, and has a variety of turnkey projects and applications (such as <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a> and <a href="https://www.pivpn.io/">PiVPN</a>) that promise a lower barrier to entry — as well as a slightly lower price point — than some of these other options. ODROID had a decent ecosystem for awhile, especially considering <a href="https://magazine.odroid.com/">the monthly ODROID Magazine</a>, though that ceased publication in July 2020. The Raspberry Pi and its variants were famously difficult to come by due to the global chip shortage from 2021-2023. Meanwhile, I had no trouble procuring these boards during the same timeframe.</p>
<p>So let’s delve into the collection…</p>
<p><strong>Cubieboard</strong></p>
<p>Anyway, I did get it up and running but never did much with it, thus setting the tone for future SBC endeavors. No photos because I gave it to another tech enthusiast years ago, whose SBC collection dwarfs my own.</p>
<p><strong>ODROID-XU4</strong></p>

<p>This is based on the Samsung Exynos 5422 SoC, the same series as was used in their Note 3 phone released in 2013. It has been a fun chip to play with. The XU4 was also my first introduction to <a href="https://www.hardkernel.com/product-category/memories/">the eMMC storage solution</a> that is commonly supported on the ODROID SBCs (alongside micro-SD). eMMC offers many benefits over SD in terms of read/write speed as well as well as longevity/write cycles. That’s getting less relevant these days, however, as more and more SBCs are being released with direct NVMe SSD support.</p>
<p>I had initially wanted to make a retro-gaming device built on this platform (see the handheld section later for more meditations on <em>that</em>). In support of this common hobbyist goal, there is <a href="https://ameridroid.com/collections/cases/products/ogst-gaming-console-case-for-odroid-xu4">this nifty case XU4 case</a> which apes the aesthetic of the Nintendo N64:</p>

<p>It even has a cool programmable LCD screen. Maybe one day I’ll find a use for it.</p>
<p>For awhile, one of these XU4 units (likely the noisy, fan-cooled one) was contributing results to <a href="https://fate.ffmpeg.org/">the FFmpeg FATE system</a>.</p>
<p>While it features gigabit ethernet and a USB3 port, I once tried to see if I could get 2 Gbps throughput with the unit using a USB3-gigabit dongle. I had curious results in that the total amount of traffic throughput could never exceed 1 Gbps across both interfaces. I.e., if 1 interface was dealing with 1 Gbps and the other interface tried to run at 1 Gbps, they would both only run at 500 Mbps. That remains a mystery to me since I don’t see that limitation with Intel chips.</p>
<p>Still, the XU4 has been useful for a variety of projects and prototyping over the years.</p>

<p>It has the same guts as the ODROID-XU4 except no video output and the USB3 function is leveraged for a SATA bridge. This allows you to plug a SATA hard drive directly into the unit:</p>

<p>Believe it or not, this has been my home NAS solution for something like 6 or 7 years now– I don’t clearly remember when I purchased it and put it into service.</p>
<p>But isn’t this sort of irresponsible? What about a failure of the main drive? That’s why I have an external drive connected for backing up the most important data via rsync:</p>

<p>The power consumption can’t be beat– Profiling for a few weeks of average usage worked out to 4.5 kWh for the ODROID-HC2… <em>per month</em>.</p>

<p>I had this on the FATE farm for awhile, performing 64-bit ARM builds (vs. the XU4’s 32-bit builds). As memory serves, it was unreliable and would occasionally freeze up.</p>

<p>I was using one of the ODROID-XU4 units as a VPN gateway. Eventually, I wanted to convert the XU4 to something else and I decided to run the VPN gateway as an appliance on the simplest device I could. So I procured this complete hand-me-down unit from eBay and went to work. This was also the first time I discovered <a href="https://dietpi.com/">the DietPi distribution</a> and this box has been in service running <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/">Wireguard</a> via <a href="https://www.pivpn.io/">PiVPN</a> for many years.</p>
<p>I also have a Raspberry Pi 3B+ kicking around somewhere. I used it as <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/6424-467A-31D9-C6CB">a Steam Link device</a> for awhile.</p>

<p>Back to using Allwinner SoCs. In order to make this thing useful, you need to place it in something. It’s possible to get <a href="https://www.pine64.org/clusterboard/">a mini-ITX form factor board that can accommodate 7 of these modules</a>. Before going to that extreme, there is this much simpler baseboard which can also use eMMC for storage.</p>

<p>When it arrived, I unpacked it, assembled the pieces, downloaded a distro, tossed that on a micro-SD card, connected a monitor and keyboard to it via its USB-C port, got the distro up and running, configured the wireless networking with a static IP address and installed sshd, and it was ready to go as a headless server for an edge application.</p>

<p>The unit came with no instructions that I can recall. After I got it set up, I remember thinking, “What is <em>wrong</em> with me? Why is it that I just know how to do all of this without any documentation?”</p>

<p>Only after I got it up and running and poked around a bit did I realize that <strong>this SBC doesn’t have an ARM SoC– it’s a RISC-V SoC</strong>. It uses the <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/D1">Allwinner D1</a>, so it looks like I came full circle back to Allwinner.</p>

<p>So I now have my first piece of RISC-V hobbyist kit, although <a href="https://codecs.multimedia.cx/2023/12/risc-v-still-not-ready-for-multimedia/">I learned recently from Kostya that it’s not that great for multimedia</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Handheld Gaming Units</strong></p>
<p>Later came the ODROID-GO Advance, also a kit, but emulating more devices. I was extremely eager to get my hands on this since it could emulate SNES in addition to NES. It also features a headphone jack, unlike the earlier model. True to form, after I received mine, it took me about 13 months before I got around to assembling it. After that, the biggest challenge I had was trying to find an appropriate case for it.</p>
<div id="attachment_4833"><p><a href="https://multimedia.cx/eggs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/odroid-go-advance-with-case.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4833" src="https://multimedia.cx/eggs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/odroid-go-advance-with-case-269x300.jpg" alt="ODROID-GO Advance with case and headphones" width="269" height="300" srcset="https://multimedia.cx/eggs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/odroid-go-advance-with-case-269x300.jpg 269w, https://multimedia.cx/eggs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/odroid-go-advance-with-case-919x1024.jpg 919w, https://multimedia.cx/eggs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/odroid-go-advance-with-case-768x855.jpg 768w, https://multimedia.cx/eggs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/odroid-go-advance-with-case-1379x1536.jpg 1379w, https://multimedia.cx/eggs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/odroid-go-advance-with-case-624x695.jpg 624w, https://multimedia.cx/eggs/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/odroid-go-advance-with-case.jpg 1422w" sizes="(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px"/></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-4833">ODROID-GO Advance with case and headphones</p></div>
<p>Even though it may try to copy the general aesthetic and form factor of the Game Boy Advance, cases for the GBA don’t fit this correctly.</p>
<p>Further, Hardkernel have also released the ODROID-GO Super and Ultra models that do more and more. The Advance, Super, and Ultra models have powerful SoCs and feature much more hackability than the first ODROID-GO model.</p>
<p>I know that the guts of the Advance have been used in other products as well. The same is likely true for the Super and Ultra.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the ODROID-GO Advance was just another project I assembled and then set aside since I like the <em>idea</em> of playing old games much more than actually doing it. Plus, the fact has finally crystalized in my mind over the past few years that I have never enjoyed handheld gaming and likely will never enjoy handheld gaming, even after I started wearing glasses. Not that I’m averse to old Game Boy / Color / Advance games, but if I’m going to play them, I’d rather emulate them on a large display.</p>
