<p><span id="more-18753"></span>Somewhere amongst the many photo albums in my parents&#8217; house there is a black and white photograph of me holding on to a quilted batik hat with both hands. I am on the deck of the ferry from Butterworth on the peninsula side of Malaysia to Georgetown in the island of Penang. I am smiling, as always.</p>
<p>As a family with my parents and sisters we stayed either at the Casuarina Beach Resort or next door at Shangri-La&#8217;s Rasa Sayang Hotel. I had such happy childhood memories of holidays here that when we were newly married I insisted Mr Gochugaru visit Penang and stay at the Rasa Sayang.</p>
<p>I thought I had not been back to Penang since then, but on the drive from KL to Georgetown Mr Gochugaru reminded me that he had in fact driven my father&#8217;s old white Mercedes (before the gold one, which was before the green one) to Penang, with my father in the car. They had taken turns to drive.</p>
<p>I cannot remember that trip at all but am happy that we made it. When my father was in remission from cancer we had talked about a trip to Penang but in the end we decided against it. He was not able to walk well and the long drive made going the washroom awkward.</p>
<p>Generally when I make decisions, whatever the outcome, I tend not to regret it. Whilst I wish circumstances had been more favourable to enable that last trip to Penang with my father, I do not look back and wish we had undertaken it.</p>
<p>In deciding where to stay for the three days we are here in Penang, I decided to skip the beach resort and stay in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town,_Penang">Georgetown</a>, named for King George III. Through a spot of good fortune <a href="https://theprestige.my">The Prestige Hotel</a> popped up on my screen when I was researching hotels in the area. The price was not extortionate and they had available rooms, so I booked us a stay.</p>

<p>The Prestige is a lovely boutique hotel that will appeal to the type of person who likes pared-down living, but who still wants convenience and comfort at hand. For connectivity there are universal electric sockets on each side of the bed and one on the wall next to the small dining table, to power your laptop should you need to work. There is another socket in the bathroom for recharging your electric toothbrush and for using the hair dryer in front of the mirror. These are not things that matter to everyone but to the person for whom these things matter, this hotel is a delight.</p>
<p>For me, the design elements are appealing, as the colour scheme is neutral and there are no busy or distracting patterns anywhere in the building, save for the botanical design used on areas of wallpaper and on cushions. I have been admiring the intentionality of the alternate patterning on the tiled floor, and the raised angular wooden beading on the walls. It sounds so geeky but I really hate clutter and it seems to me someone has thought through the whole design scheme, making sure that everything is neat and tidy without being flat and boring.</p>

<p>Other good things about this hotel: in-room Nespresso machines and <a href="https://twgtea.com">TWG</a> teabags, a carpark with complimentary parking for in-house guests, good restaurants and cafes within walking distance, Norm Micro Roastery is directly opposite and the Penang Tourist Information Centre is just around the corner. It is located in the historical part of town so you can wander along streets that have been here for 200 years.</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, I pay for my own hotels and only write about the ones I have enjoyed staying in. I never write about anything that has been a disappointment because everyone has disappointments in life. The last thing you want to read about are other people&#8217;s bad experiences as you can get that ad infinitum from the daily news.</p>
<p>In the next few posts there will be some information about local tourist sights and eating places. So many good things to eat and so few days. Whilst on my swim this morning I was mentally inviting our family to join me on my next trip here. My father may not be with us physically but I am sure he will be with us in spirit.</p>
