    <h1>Beware of SendGrid Phishing Scams - Several Examples and How to Protect Yourself</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>DISCLOSURE: If you buy through affiliate links, I may earn a small commission. <a href="https://hamy.xyz/blog/disclosures">(disclosures)</a></p><div><p>I&#39;ve been running HAMY LABS since 2019 and have jumped around to various email hosts over the years. At one point I was using SendGrid.</p>
<p>Starting in 2025.11 I noticed an uptick in emails coming from SendGrid notifying me of errors and account changes. I logged into my SendGrid account to check on things and it was barren as I expected it to be - since I&#39;d stopped using it. I assumed this was some sort of fluke.</p>
<p>This week a new crop of emails came in and I&#39;ve only just realized that this is all part of a phishing scam - they&#39;re not coming from SendGrid at all!</p>
<p>So in this post I want to log the various scam emails I&#39;ve seen to hopefully help others avoid being tricked by this and provide a few ways to avoid getting phished in general. (Luckily I followed one of these rules so even though I was tricked, I didn&#39;t get phished!).</p>

<h2 id="sendgrid-phishing-email-examples">SendGrid Phishing Email Examples</h2>
<p>Here I&#39;ll show examples of a couple types of phishing emails I got posing as SendGrid. Note these did not actually seem to come from SendGrid the company, they were just faked to look like it.</p>
<p>These emails come in several different forms under the given categories so what you see in your email inbox is likely going to be slightly different than what I saw in mine - these phishing operations often try out lots of different variations to see what actually works on unsuspecting targets.</p>
<h3 id="unexpected-failure-phishing-emails">Unexpected Failure Phishing emails</h3>
<p>The most common one I got was a notification of some type of failure. I saw API request failures, migration failures, and authentication failures though there are probably more.</p>
<p>These emails seem to try and show something is broken to create a sense of urgency in me - oh no, I need to fix this now! I didn&#39;t follow that link but they&#39;re trying to get me to click on one of them and log into some fake portal which will probably log my credentials somewhere they can get access to it.</p>
<p>The branding is well-formed, including the brand marks and street address for the company (not sure if that&#39;s the correct street address, but an address is there).</p>

<h3 id="account-change-notification-phishing-emails">Account Change Notification Phishing Emails</h3>
<p>Another version that actually got me to log into SendGrid to see what was happening was a notification about a sub-user being added to my account. This is a pretty typical notification to expect as a security precaution when a major change happens.</p>
<p>Here they&#39;re trying to get me with urgency as if I didn&#39;t make this change (I didn&#39;t) it could be a potential security issue. And they did get me - I just didn&#39;t click the link they wanted me to and instead logged into SendGrid directly only to find nothing looked wrong.</p>

<h3 id="opt-out-change-phishing-emails">Opt Out Change Phishing Emails</h3>
<p>This one almost got me and made me take a closer look. It&#39;s an email stating that a &#34;support ICE&#34; button will be placed inside of every email I send unless I opt out now. I thought this was so random and bold for SendGrid to do this considering the ongoing unrest around ICE - and also super unprofessional, why roll out a huge change like this when it likely doesn&#39;t make sense for 99% of customer emails?</p>
<p><em>For those that don&#39;t know, the current US Government has deployed ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to cities around the country to round up &#34;illegals&#34;. This is a big deal as 1) may not be legal, 2) they often get citizens instead, and 3) numerous reports of brazen violence.</em></p>
<p>I was about to share a screenshot to Twitter when I was like wait a minute, let me double check this. So I did and realized that this did not come from a sendgrid domain at all!</p>
<p>Here they&#39;re using emotion and a sense of urgency to try and get me to click the button. No I don&#39;t want an ICE ad on my emails - better act fast or it&#39;s going to be added to ALL of them!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-avoid-phishing-attacks">How to avoid phishing attacks</h2>
<p>You can&#39;t really <em>avoid</em> phishing attacks - they&#39;ll land in your inbox whether you like it or not. But what we can do is avoid the impact of these attacks.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Never (EVER) click links in an email / text message.</strong> This is the one that saved me. I never click links in emails / texts so even though I got tricked by two different emails (account change and ICE support) nothing bad happened because I didn&#39;t click their links which would&#39;ve led me to a fake website / malicious website to steal my info.</li>
<li><strong>Double check who the email is from.</strong> It&#39;s easy to fake branding and sender names but harder to fake email addresses (not impossible though so still be careful and don&#39;t click links). I got emails from many different domains, none of which were SendGrid. It doesn&#39;t mean these domains are necessarily bad but they were at least compromised and used to send bad emails. A quick sample of some of the domains that sent these emails: <code>truefit [dot] com, nysar [dot] org, mooreandgiles [dot] com, theraoffice [dot] com, leasebusters [dot] com</code></li>
<li><strong>If something seems strange, do a double or triple take.</strong> This is what happened with the ICE email. I was like this is the craziest thing for a company to do, why would they do this? Then I saw - oh yeah, they didn&#39;t. But even other things like why am I getting so many API failures, I don&#39;t even use this or why is the formatting looking weird can be tips this is fake.</li>
<li><strong>Use a password manager.</strong> This one is indirect but super useful. Password managers will only autofill for the domain a password was saved on. So if you do click a malicious link then a good password manager will not autofill. Obvs this doesn&#39;t help if you still go through the motions to fill it in yourself but it&#39;s a quick nudge to double check the domain you&#39;re on - WHY isn&#39;t the password manager autofilling? Is this the correct domain?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next">Next</h2>
<p>Phishing emails have been around forever so this attack isn&#39;t exactly new. What is new is that AI is getting better and better at creating exact copies of emails and web pages so that it&#39;s much harder to notice small flaws that could lead you to suspect phishing. As AI continues to improve, we&#39;ll likely see even more advanced attacks like flawless impersonations over audio and video.</p>
<p>Note: If you see a scam like this, be sure to report it! Most email tools have a way to report spam / phishing so it&#39;s a good way to give data to the algorithm to start weeding those out.</p>
