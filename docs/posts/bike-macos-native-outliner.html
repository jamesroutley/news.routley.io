<p>Bike is a macOS native outliner. Bike has good performance on big outlines. Bike uses open file formats and is scriptable too. Use Bike to record and process your ideas.</p>

<p>Outlines are powerful, but can be confusing. In Bike outline editing is fluid, your ideas flow across the screen instead of jumping from position to position. This makes it easier to track what’s going on, and it’s fun!</p>

<h2>Why Bike?</h2>

<p>I think macOS needs more &#34;bicycles for the mind&#34;.</p>

<p>Bike is small enough to fully understand. Once understood it’s flexible enough to be used for many purposes.</p>

<p>Bike is small, but designed for real work. It’s fast. It can handle big outlines that break other outliners. Bike&#39;s also fast at the basics–opening files, scrolling views, and resizing windows. Bike won’t slow your Mac down.</p>

<p>Bike makes your work open and accessible. Outlines are stored in text files using standard file formats. Bike is also scriptable. Automate and extend Bike into your own workflows with scripts.</p>
