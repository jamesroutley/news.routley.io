                        <p>A French court <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000046555948?init=true&amp;page=5&amp;query=&amp;searchField=ALL&amp;tab_selection=juri" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">has ruled</a> that companies can&#39;t fire their workers for failing to be sufficiently &#34;fun.&#34;</p><p>The ruling comes after a man, referred to as Mr T, was fired from the Paris consultancy firm Cubik Partners in 2015 for refusing to participate in after-work drinks and team-building activities.</p><p>According to the court documents, Mr T joined the firm in February 2011 and was promoted in 2014, but was fired a year later in March 2015 for &#34;professional incompetence&#34; — specifically his refusal to adhere to the company&#39;s &#34;fun&#34; values. Cubik Partners also said Mr T was difficult to work with and a poor listener. </p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000046555948?init=true&amp;page=5&amp;query=&amp;searchField=ALL&amp;tab_selection=juri" data-analytics-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow">Court of Cassation</a>, the company&#39;s &#34;fun&#34; values included regular obligatory social events that culminated in &#34;excessive alcoholism encouraged by colleagues who made very large quantities of alcohol available,&#34; as well as &#34;practices pushed by colleagues involving promiscuity, bullying and incitement to various excesses.&#34;</p>
                        
                        <p>The court – the highest in the French legal system – also outlined various &#34;humiliating and intrusive&#34; practices promoted by Cubik Partners including simulations of sexual acts and the obligation to share a bed with a colleague.</p><p>In a judgement issued on November 9, the court found that because Mr T&#39;s lack of participation in the company&#39;s &#34;fun&#34; values and &#34;critical behavior&#34; were reasons cited for his dismissal he had been wrongfully fired by Cubik Partners. </p><p>The court ruled that Mr T was exercising his &#34;freedom of expression&#34; by refusing to participate in the company&#39;s social activities, and that performing this &#34;fundamental freedom&#34; could not be a reason for his dismissal.</p><p>Cubik Partners did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider.</p>
                        
                        <p>Mr T&#39;s demand of 461,406 euros (about $479,000) in damages was previously rejected by the Paris Court of Appeal in 2021, but the recent ruling by the Court of Cassation partially overturned this judgement.</p><p>The court ordered Cubik Partners to pay Mr T 3,000 euros and will examine Mr T&#39;s demand for damages at a later stage.</p>
