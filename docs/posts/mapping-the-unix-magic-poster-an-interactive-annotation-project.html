    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div id="annotation-01-su"><p><span>1</span>
<span>su</span></p><p>Command to switch your identity</p><p>The <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/su.1.html">su</a> command (short for “substitute user” or
“switch user”) is used to start a shell under a different user account.
Typically, one of the most common uses of su is switching to the superuser
(root) account to gain administrative privileges.</p><p><a href="#">🔝</a></p></div><div id="annotation-02-man"><p><span>2</span>
<span>man</span></p><p>Command to get detailed documentation of different unix components, including other cmds.</p><p>The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html">man(1)</a>
command (short for manual) is used to display online reference manuals (man
pages) for commands, system calls, configuration files, and other aspects of
the system. man provides detailed documentation on how to use a command,
including its options, usage examples, related files, and other pertinent
details.</p><p><a href="#">🔝</a></p></div><div id="annotation-03-pipes"><p><span>3</span>
<span>Pipes</span></p><p>Connect cmd outputs to cmd inputs to create complex pipelines</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">Pipes</a> are a
foundational feature in Unix that enable you to combine simple utilities into
more powerful workflows. By passing data from one command’s output to another
command’s input, pipes allow you to quickly create flexible, efficient, and
maintainable solutions directly at the command line. They are denoted in the
shell by the vertical bar character (|).</p><p><a href="#">🔝</a></p></div><div id="annotation-04-leak"><p><span>4</span>
<span>Memory leaks</span></p><p>Improper managing of memory by a computer program</p><p>A memory leak occurs when a computer program improperly manages memory
allocation, failing to release memory that’s no longer needed. Over time, these
un-freed allocations accumulate, reducing the amount of available memory for
other processes and potentially leading to slowdowns or crashes.</p><p><a href="#">🔝</a></p></div><div id="annotation-05-kandr"><p><span>5</span>
<span>Legendary figures</span></p><p>Legendary figures in Unix history</p><div><p>In the context of Unix history these three sets of initials refer to legendary
figures in the creation and development of Unix:</p><p>dmr: Dennis M. Ritchie, co-creator of Unix and creator of the C programming
language.</p><p>kt: Ken Thompson (often just “ken” in historical Unix references), co-creator
of Unix alongside Ritchie.</p><p>bwk: Brian W. Kernighan, co-author of several influential Unix programs and
books (including “The C Programming Language” and “The UNIX Programming
Environment”).</p></div><p><a href="#">🔝</a></p></div><div id="annotation-06-c"><p><span>6</span>
<span>The c programming language</span></p><p>A key programming language in the creation of Unix</p><p>C is deeply intertwined with the history and development of the Unix operating
system. Created by Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, C was
used to rewrite Unix from low-level assembly into a higher-level language. This
shift made Unix significantly more portable across different hardware
platforms, fueling its rapid adoption in academia and industry. Over time, C
evolved into one of the most influential and widely used programming languages
in history.</p><p><a href="#">🔝</a></p></div><div id="annotation-07-backpressure"><p><span>7</span>
<span>Backpressure</span></p><p>Tell producers to stop sending data because the consumer cannot keep up</p><div><p>When two processes communicate over a pipe, the process sending data is the
producer, and the process receiving data is the consumer. The OS maintains a
buffer to temporarily store data if the producer sends data faster than the
consumer can process it. However, if the buffer becomes full, the OS will block
the producer until space is available.</p><p>Was that the intention of the artist? You decide—is the wheel in the pipes a
clever reference to UNIX back pressure, or is that a stretch?</p></div><p><a href="#">🔝</a></p></div><div id="annotation-08-daemons"><p><span>8</span>
<span>Daemons</span></p><p>Service processes that run in the background and supervise the system or provide functionality to other processes</p><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">Daemons</a> are programs that run in the background
and are often started at system boot time. They respond to network requests, hardware activity,
or other programs by performing some task. Daemons such as cron may also perform
defined tasks at scheduled times.</p><p>The term was coined by the programmers at MIT’s Project MAC. It is inspired by Maxwell’s demon and
greek mythology, acting as a metaphor for a supernatural being working in the background.</p></div><p><a href="#">🔝</a></p></div></div></div>
