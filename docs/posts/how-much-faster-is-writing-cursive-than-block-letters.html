    <h1>How much faster is writing cursive than block letters?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>It isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>There is a time in every man&#39;s education when he comes to the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; and that science isn&#39;t something that happens only to other people.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> For me, that moment came when I read Ruth Daniel&#39;s excellent essay testing whether salting pasta water makes it taste better.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Before then, it hadn&#39;t occurred that I could isolate assumptions that I have in my life, and well... test them.</p>
<p>One assumption I&#39;ve long held is that cursive is faster to write than block letters. I handwrite a lot of things, so this is an useful question to ask. Cursive has a lot of downsides (harder to read and transcribe; harder to transcribe using OCR technologies), so any speed differential is super important.</p>
<p>I decided to test this by doing a little experiment. The results surprised me.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The basic idea was to be very simple: choose a text, write it in both cursive and block lettering, and then compare how long it took to write. However, in order to avoid bias due to hand fatigue, I chose two texts to write from, instead of one, and alternated the order.</p>
<p>I go into more detail below, but it&#39;s mostly straightforward. I only did one clever thing: To prevent myself from seeing results partway through, I used voice recordings to determine how long each trial took.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-plan">Experimental Plan</h2>
<p><em>Materials needed</em> (specific material used):</p>
<ul>
<li>Two texts of equivalent length and similar content (Gettysburg Address and &#34;We Shall Fight on the Beaches&#34; closing<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>)</li>
<li>
<p>Clean paper of a consistent type (Printer paper)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistent writing utensil (Pilot G-2 07 Pen)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recording device (cell phone)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quiet, well-lit space with a comfortable writing surface (two distinct rooms)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coin for randomization (or other method; I searched &#34;Flip a Coin&#34; into duckduckgo.com) </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Setup</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Using a coin flip:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose the first text (Gettysburg Address) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First writing style (Block lettering) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up comfortable writing space with minimal distractions</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>For each combination (style &amp; text) in the order &#34;first text, first style; first text, second style; second text, second style; second text, first style&#34;</em>:<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start the audio recording (or keep a voice memo running between trials)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read through the entire text once</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the warm-up sentence (&#34;The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&#34;) in the upcoming style</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say &#34;start&#34; and begin writing the test: </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write at a natural pace, aiming for clean writing without being overly careful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immediately after finishing transcribing the given text say &#34;Stop&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Between trials, take breaks:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5-minute break between different styles of the same text<sup id="fnref2:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take a longer break between texts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make any extraneous notes as necessary   </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Analysis</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Review recording to determine exact length of writing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare speeds between styles</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The results can be summarized in the table below:</p>

<h2 id="experimental-screw-ups">Experimental screw-ups</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&#39;d forgotten I had a music alarm set, so music started playing in the middle of the first trial. To replicate, I did that as well with the second trial.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 3rd and 4th trials were conducted in a different room, on the same day, but later</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The block lettering seems more legible at a glance.</p>

<p><strong>My cursive doesn&#39;t seem to be any faster</strong>: This surprised me. I expected cursive that was going to be quite a bit faster, and I became more convinced of this as I conducted my experiment. However, when I actually tallied the results, there didn&#39;t seem to be a large difference either way.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> Cursive may even be a little bit slower, but that&#39;s hard to say.</p>
<p><strong>The results are only valid to me</strong>: There&#39;s quite a bit of variation in individual writing styles, so it may be different for others.</p>
<p><strong>Psychological factors are important</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Using the voice memos was good because otherwise I would have skewed my writing speed to some extent</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cursive felt much less slow and more pleasant in the moment. I was convinced that I was going to find a huge discrepancy.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8">8</a></sup> I really didn&#39;t. This might be important. Perhaps cursive is less fatiguing, or I like it more?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limitations</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatigue definitely played a factor here:</li>
<li>We see that the second style is slower in both text samples</li>
<li>A five minute break was likely too short</li>
<li>The transcription task may be different than day to day writing</li>
<li>This was not a composition task. It may be that cursive feeling more fluent leads to more fluent thinking and thoughts. Which leads to a higher overall Words Per Minute.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&#39;s next?:</h2>
<p>There are a couple of directions to go in. One is to investigate whether I can write more quickly with a mixed cursive-block style (as several studies suggested was faster; see footnote 7).</p>
<p>The experimental idea I find more interesting is to investigate any effect within my journaling. The experiment would be to randomize on different days which style I was using, and track a) the amount of time I spent writing b) the amount of words I wrote and c) my percieved fatigue. There are some limitations with this design, but it might still hold some valueable insights.</p>

<p>This went better than I expected. Midway through running this experiment (which took around a day to run and write-up), I thought that I was wasting my time. But I ended up with a result I completely didn&#39;t expect.</p>
<p>Let me know if you want to replicate this experiment, and let me know how it goes!</p>
