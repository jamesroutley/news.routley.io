    <h1>New Group Attacking iPhone Encryption Backed by US Political Dark-Money Network</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
<p><u>The Heat Initiative,</u> a nonprofit child safety advocacy group, was formed earlier this year to campaign against some of the strong privacy protections Apple provides customers. The group says these protections help enable child exploitation, objecting to the fact that pedophiles can encrypt their personal data just like everyone else.</p>



<p>When Apple launched its new iPhone this September, the Heat Initiative seized on the occasion, taking out a full-page New York Times ad, using digital billboard trucks, and even hiring a plane to fly over Apple headquarters with a banner message. The message on the banner appeared simple: “Dear Apple, Detect Child Sexual Abuse in iCloud” — Apple’s cloud storage system, which today employs a range of powerful encryption technologies aimed at preventing hackers, spies, and Tim Cook from knowing anything about your private files.</p>



<p>Something the Heat Initiative has not placed on giant airborne banners is who’s behind it: a controversial billionaire philanthropy network whose influence and tactics have drawn unfavorable comparisons to the right-wing Koch network. Though it does not publicize this fact, the Heat Initiative is a project of the Hopewell Fund, an organization that helps privately and often secretly direct the largesse — and political will — of billionaires. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/us/politics/democrats-dark-money-donors.html">Hopewell is part of a giant, tightly connected web</a> of largely anonymous, Democratic Party-aligned dark-money groups, in an ironic turn, campaigning to undermine the privacy of ordinary people.</p>

<p>For experts on transparency about money in politics, the Hopewell Fund’s place in the wider network of Democratic dark money raises questions that groups in the network are disinclined to answer.</p>



<p>“None of these groups are particularly open with me or other people who are tracking dark money about what it is they’re doing,” said Robert Maguire, of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, or CREW. Maguire said the way the network operated called to mind perhaps the most famous right-wing philanthropy and dark-money political network: the constellation of groups run and supported by the billionaire owners of Koch Industries. Of the Hopewell network, Maguire said, “They also take on some of the structural calling cards of the Koch network; it is a convoluted group, sometimes even intentionally so.”</p>



<p>The decadeslong political and technological campaign to diminish encryption for the sake of public safety — known as the “Crypto Wars” — has in recent years pivoted from stoking fears of terrorists chatting in secret to child predators evading police scrutiny. No matter the subject area, the battle is being waged between those who think privacy is an absolute right and those who believe it ought to be limited for expanded oversight from law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The ideological lines pit privacy advocates, computer scientists, and cryptographers against the FBI, the U.S. Congress, the European Union, and other governmental bodies around the world. Apple’s complex 2021 proposal to scan cloud-bound images before they ever left your phone became <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-detection-icloud-photos-encryption-privacy/">divisive even within the field of cryptography itself</a>.</p>

<!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[1] -->



<p>While the motives on both sides tend to be clear — there’s little mystery as to why the FBI doesn’t like encryption — the Heat Initiative, as opaque as it is new, introduces the obscured interests of billionaires to a dispute over the rights of ordinary individuals. </p>



<p>“I’m uncomfortable with anonymous rich people with unknown agendas pushing these massive invasions of our privacy,” Matthew Green, a cryptographer at Johns Hopkins University and a critic of the plan to have Apple scan private files on its devices, told The Intercept. “There are huge implications for national security as well as consumer privacy against corporations. Plenty of unsavory reasons for people to push this technology that have nothing to do with protecting children.”</p>

<h2 id="h-apple-s-aborted-scanning-scheme">Apple’s Aborted Scanning Scheme</h2>



<p>Last month, Wired <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-csam-scanning-heat-initiative-letter/">reported</a> the previously unknown Heat Initiative was pressing Apple to reconsider its highly controversial 2021 proposal to have iPhones constantly scan their owners’ photos as they were uploaded to iCloud, checking to see if they were in possession of child sexual abuse material, known as CSAM. If a scan turned up CSAM, police would be alerted. While most large internet companies check files their users upload and share against a centralized database of known CSAM, Apple’s plan went a step further, proposing to check for illegal files not just on the company’s servers, but directly on its customers’ phones.</p>



<p>“In the hierarchy of human privacy, your private files and photos should be your most important confidential possessions,” Green said. “We even wrote this into the U.S. Constitution.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/18/apples-csam-detection-tech-is-under-fire-again/">backlash</a> was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/19/apple-csam-abuse-encryption-security-privacy-dangerous/">swift</a> and effective. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/opinion/apple-iphones-privacy.html">Computer scientists, cryptographers</a>,<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life"> digital rights advocates</a>, and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/apples-new-child-safety-plan-for-iphones-isnt-so-safe">civil libertarians</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632722/apple-child-abuse-scan-ios-abandon-request-privacy">immediately protested</a>, claiming the scanning would create a deeply dangerous precedent. The ability to scan users’ devices could open up iPhones around the world to snooping by authoritarian governments, hackers, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/laliga-talks-to-google-about-piracy-apps-from-a-million-phones-230924/">corporations</a>, and security agencies. A year later, Apple reversed course and said it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/7/23498588/apple-csam-icloud-photos-scanning-encryption">shelving</a> the idea.</p>



<p>Green said that efforts to push Apple to monitor the private files of iPhone owners are part of a <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/27/apple-online-safety-bill-encryption/">broader effort</a> against encryption, whether used to safeguard your photographs or speak privately with others — rights that were taken for granted before the digital revolution. “We have to have some principles about what we’ll give up to fight even heinous crime,” he said. “And these proposals give up everything.”</p>



<!-- BLOCK(pullquote)[3](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PULLQUOTE%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22pull%22%3A%22left%22%7D) --><blockquote data-shortcode-type="pullquote" data-pull="left"><!-- CONTENT(pullquote)[3] -->“We have to have some principles about what we’ll give up to fight even heinous crime. And these proposals give up everything.”<!-- END-CONTENT(pullquote)[3] --></blockquote><!-- END-BLOCK(pullquote)[3] -->



<p>In an unusual move justifying its position, Apple provided Wired with <a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/23933180-apple-letter-to-heat-initiative/?embed=1&amp;responsive=1&amp;title=1">a copy of the letter</a> it sent to the Heat Initiative in reply to its demands. “Scanning every user’s privately stored iCloud data would create new threat vectors for data thieves to find and exploit,” the letter read. “It would also inject the potential for a slippery slope of unintended consequences. Scanning for one type of content, for instance, opens the door for bulk surveillance and could create a desire to search other encrypted messaging systems across content types.”</p>



<p>The strong encryption built into iPhones, which shields sensitive data like your photos and iMessage conversations even from Apple itself, is frequently criticized by police agencies and national security hawks as providing shelter to dangerous criminals. In a <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course">2014 speech</a>, then-FBI Director James Comey singled out Apple’s encryption specifically, warning that “encryption threatens to lead all of us to a very dark place.”</p>



<p>Some cryptographers respond that it’s impossible to filter possible criminal use of encryption without defeating the whole point of encryption in the first place: keeping out prying eyes.</p>



<p>Similarly, any attempt to craft special access for police to use to view encrypted conversations when they claim they need to — a “backdoor” mechanism for law enforcement access — would be impossible to safeguard against abuse, a stance Apple now says it shares.</p>

<h2>Dark-Money Network</h2>



<p>For an organization demanding that Apple scour the private information of its customers, the Heat Initiative discloses extremely little about itself. According to a report in the New York Times, the Heat Initiative is armed with $2 million from donors including the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, an organization founded by British billionaire hedge fund manager and Google activist investor Chris Cohn, and the Oak Foundation, also founded by a British billionaire. The Oak Foundation previously provided $250,000 to a group attempting to <a href="https://ecpat.org/ecpat-project-beacon/">weaken end-to-end encryption protections</a> in EU legislation, according to a <a href="https://oakfnd.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Oak-Foundation-Annual-Report-2020-online-version-high-res-1.pdf">2020 annual report</a>.</p>
