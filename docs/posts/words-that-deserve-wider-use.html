    <h1>Words that deserve wider use</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Here&#39;s a list of neglected but eminently useful words that visitors to this site -- and we, to be downright honest -- would like to bring back into fashion. You&#39;re right -- some never have been in fashion, but perhaps they deserve to be. Many submissions have been edited for content, grammar and especially for accuracy. Not all these words will make our list of top choices, but there&#39;s a great deal of quality here, most are wonderful additions to anyone&#39;s vocabulary, and all could use some exercise.</p><div>
