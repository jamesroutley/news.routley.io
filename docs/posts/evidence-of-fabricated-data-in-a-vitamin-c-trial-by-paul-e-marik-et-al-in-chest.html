    <h1>Evidence of Fabricated Data in a Vitamin C trial by Paul E Marik et al in CHEST</h1>

<p> Below is an email I have sent to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, the editor of CHEST Journal, and prof Paul E Marik. As always an allegation against a multi-author paper is not an allegation against any individual author. </p><p><span>To:</span></p><p>cc: The Board of Norfolk Sentara Norfolk General Hospital</p><p>cc: The Compliance officer of Sentara Norfolk General Hospital</p><p>cc: Prof Paul E Marik</p><p>Dear Editor</p><p>Tonight on twitter a paper allegedly describing a 2017 study by a &#34;Paul Marik&#34; and team at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital describing a large survival benefit from Vitamin C was brought to my attention as a medical research finding that was not replicated in further studies and later reversed. The user stated that to their knowledge no evidence of fraud in the conduct of this study had been identified. The study is found at <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2016.11.036&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1648039588818000&amp;usg=AOvVaw14iSKOsBFwjrcUIJNeqQYX" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2016.11.036" target="_blank">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.<wbr/>chest.2016.11.036</a></p><p>Unfortunately within about 5 minutes of reading the study it became overwhelmingly clear that it is indeed research fraud and the data is fabricated.</p><p>While usually I would use cautious language of &#34;unusual&#34; or &#34;unexpected&#34; patterns in the data and describe &#34;irregularities&#34; and &#34;concern&#34;; no such caution is warranted in this case. This is frankly audacious fraud. I have not requested access to the raw data or contacted the authors for explanation as the case is audacious no other explanation is possible.</p><p>Allow me to explain.</p><p>This study allegedly describes a before and after study, examining the effect of a new treatment regime based on vitamin c on mortality in sepsis, claiming a roughly ten fold reduction in death. Each cohort had exactly 47 patients and the patients were <b>not </b>matched. We know this not just because matching was not mentioned but because the authors specify that these were two cohorts of &#34;consecutive&#34; patients, precluding patient matching by definition.</p><p>Based on this we would expect that if there was no systemic bias the p values for differences in dichotomous baseline characteristics (gender, demographics, comorbidities, diagnoses etc) would, of course, centre on 0.5. If systemic differences existed however the groups may be less similar and p values may tend to numbers below 0.5, and this would not be suspicious in a non-randomised study. Systemic biases to p values greater than 0.5 are not possible without matching (or some very rare pseudo-block designs not relevant here) except in the setting of fraud.</p><p>Unfortunately every single primary diagnosis (Pneumonia, Urosepsis, Primary Bacteremia, GI/Biliary, &#34;Other&#34;) is matched perfectly with a p value from a Fisher exact test of 1. </p><p>Indeed of the 23 discrete/continuous variables reported in table 1 the majority have a p value of 1.</p><p>The following variables had a p value of 1, i.e. were distributed perfectly evenly across the two time periods (or as maximally perfectly evenly as possible in the case of odd numbers).</p><p>Acute Kidney Injury: 61 patients</p><p>Vasopressors: 44 patients</p><p><span>Primary Diagnosis - Pneumonia: 37 patients</span></p><p>Heart Failure: 31 patients</p><p>Positive blood cultures: 26 patients</p><p>Primary Diagnosis - Urosepsis: 21 patients<br/></p><p>COPD: 15 patients</p><p>Chronic Renal Failure: 15 patients</p><p>Primary Diagnosis - Primary Bacteremia: 14 patients<br/></p><p>Primary Diagnosis - GI/Biliary: 12 patients<br/></p><p>Drug addiction: 10 patients</p><p>Primary Diagnosis - Other: 10 patients<br/></p><p>Lack of comorbidities: 3 patients</p><p>A more fulsome table of p values is annexed to the end of this complaint, however this figure shows the plotted p values for all 23 dichotomous variables in table 1. Note that instead of the even distribution between 0 and 1 (or clustering below 1 if the cohorts were dissimilar) instead most variables have a p value of 1, 21/23 variables have p values over 0.5, and no p value of below 0.4 is seen for any of the 23 variables.</p><p><img alt="image.png" data-image-whitelisted="" height="304" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOgPW5GaIAYRLiR?format=png&amp;name=large" tabindex="0" width="562"/><br/></p><p>This actually presents a slight problem in estimating how unlikely these results are, as the most common test for fraud in this situation would be the Stouff-Fisher, but this will declare these results infinitely unlikely (as the majority of variables have a p value of exactly 1), when in reality it is probably more likely that it is trillions to quadrillions to one.</p><p>A &#34;quick and dirty&#34; way to assess this would be to consider that the probability of any one variable having a p value over 0.4 is 60%, the binomial probability of 23 such measures having no observed values under 0.4 is (0.6)^23 or less than 1 in 100,000, this assumes independence which is perhaps a little unfair, but likely massively underestimates the improbability of such a finding as the results are not evenly distributed between 0.4 and 1.</p><div><p>There is simply no explanation for this other than fraud. The methods are described clearly and these are explicitly two cohorts of consecutive patients, so the only real innocent explanation here (undisclosed matching by baseline characteristics) did not occur (and it clearly didn&#39;t anyway as matching patients this exactly would not be possible even with thousands of such patients).</p></div><p>______</p>
