This is a truly huge update that promises to both add to and improve the overall Night City experience. Improvements range from AI overhauls and perk system reworkings to quest adjustments and open world streaming.</p>
<p>A lot of it is honestly the kind of stuff that <em>should</em> have been in the game from the beginning, but at least it&#39;s here now, and it <em>might</em> be enough to warrant a second chance for Cyberpunk 2077 on PlayStation consoles.</p>

It’s free and you can do it as often as you like. Character customization also includes more makeup and hair color options. Who&#39;s the fairest of them all, now?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What&#39;s New at Wilson’s?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can check out new items in Wilson’s 2nd Amendment store in Megabuilding H10 or look for them while exploring Night City.</li>
<li>2 new weapons: Darra Polytechnic Umbra (Power Assault Rifle), Budget Arms Guillotine (Power Submachine Gun)</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>New Poses in Photo Mode</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We added a number of new poses in Photo Mode, including poses for Johnny Silverhand (only available in flashback scenes when playing as Johnny).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>LIVING CITY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Combat AI</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple fixes and improvements to NPC melee and ranged combat AI and reactions, including taking cover, positioning, reloading, equipping weapons, dodging, blocking and many others.</li>
<li>Multiple improvements to dismemberment triggers, hit reactions and death animations, adding greater impact to ranged and melee combat.</li>
<li>Enemies are now much better at blocking and evading (Kerenzikov) attacks. The heavier the weapon, the easier it is to hit. The opposite is true for evading.</li>
<li>Further diversification of melee and ranged combat behaviors for different factions: reckless, aggressive, balanced, defensive and cautious.</li>
<li>Followers now contribute more in combat but can be defeated and temporarily disabled if they receive enough punishment.</li>
<li>Numerous fixes and balance changes to netrunner combat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Crowd Improvements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aggressive crowd behavior: certain NPC archetypes can and will enter combat with the player when provoked by aiming, shooting or fighting. Due to some technical challenges, this change is not available on the previous generation of consoles.</li>
<li>Time skips affect the state of NPCs, as well as reset the state of the devices, environments and certain scenes.</li>
<li>Improved crowd reactions, pathfinding and despawning.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Drive Model</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing our all new Burn Out Mode! Hold Gas + Brake to engage, steer to rotate. The old system only allowed rotating on the spot, now try modulating the inputs to see what you can do! Try brake stands, donuts, drifts or heat up the tires to do a drag-race style launch with a High Grip boost. The system now works at higher speeds, so you can hit the brake with gas applied on corner entry to cause oversteer on most cars. Keyboard users can optionally use new Secondary bindings on arrow keys (some keyboards ignore the third key press when just using WASD), but gamepads allow the most control of the system (as gamepads in general provide the driving experience preferred by a vast majority of players).</li>
<li>New Braking system produces consistent performance, front to rear, across all speeds. ABS simulation added. All vehicles brakes have been tuned to the new model.</li>
<li>Engine simulation improved. Clutch simulation added. These changes improve resistance forces from the engine when shifting, helping to remove unwanted wheel spin events.</li>
<li>Gearbox simulation improved. Much improved downshifting behavior. Transmission now realistically downshifts and has smarter shift logic to keep the engine in its sweet spot. Forward &lt;-&gt; Reverse shifting has been totally redone, allowing for J-Turns / Rockfords.</li>
<li>Motorcycles improved. All of the above improvements help to make them more stable. Additionally, steering model improvements have been added, and they have been retuned.</li>
<li>Tune improvements to various cars. Quadra Type-66 (all models, especially Avenger), Mizutani Shion (especially MZ2), Herrera Outlaw (major pass) &amp; base MaiMai all had steering improvements implemented and more.</li>
<li>Added adjustments to first-person perspective to all vehicles that needed it. In addition, Nomad vehicles with CrystalDome technology now digitally omit objects obscuring view.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vehicle Traffic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Visual improvement to traffic movement: turning and suspension.</li>
<li>Panic reaction to danger: traffic now has the ability to drive away in panic from danger. NPC passengers can now die from car crashes.</li>
<li>Reactions to fender benders: vehicles now have a wider range of reactions to being bumped into, and will recover and return to traffic more smoothly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>GAMEPLAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Various changes related to the economy, including increased rewards from jobs and Open World activities and decreased prices for vehicles and cyberware.</li>
<li>Rebalanced and improved functionality of clothing mods. Adjusted the amount of modification slots available on clothing items. Categorized the mods to fit only specific clothing items. <strong>As a result, all equipped mods were moved back to your inventory. Go to the Inventory screen to re-equip them in accordance with the new rules.</strong></li>
<li>The &#34;Easy&#34; game difficulty is now moderately more challenging.</li>
<li>Introduced 2 new stats replacing Evasion: Mitigation Chance and Mitigation Strength. Mitigation Chance determines how often the player has a chance to reduce incoming damage. Mitigation Strength determines the percentage by which damage is reduced (50% by default).</li>
<li>Components that used to increase Evasion now affect Mitigation. For example: the Reflexes attribute, perks such as Mongoose, Vanishing Point, Human Shield, some clothing mods and cyberware, and more.</li>
<li>Rebalanced Damage Over Time effects, generally reducing primary damage effects such as Burning, Bleeding and Poison.</li>
<li>Reduced chance to disrupt trajectory of smart bullets by Tyger Claws&#39; Glowing Tattoos ability.</li>
<li>Added a quieter way to escape the NCPD when the heat is on. Instead of fleeing a certain distance from the most recent crime scene, V can opt to hide within the search area, although it will take longer for the police to stop looking.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cyberware</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s now possible to sell unused cyberware at a Ripperdoc.</li>
<li>Cooldown duration is now properly described in the tooltip of Blood Pump cyberware.</li>

<li>Tranquilizer Rounds in the Projectile Launch System no longer affect non-human NPCs.</li>
<li>Reduced the ricochet number of the Legendary Ballistic Coprocessor to 1, but grants a 50% bonus to ricochet damage.</li>

<li>Increased duration of Optical Camo cyberware for V from 5/10/15 to 10/15/15 per rarity level.</li>
<li>Added the Optical Camo ability for some NPCs.</li>

<li>Increased visual complexity of enemy combat behavior in low-framerate mode.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when combat mode was triggered while roaming.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player could be knocked down by a hammer attack despite the weapon not reaching them.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>NPCs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lowered the health of the opponents in Beat on the Brat, except for the Twins - they can now block and/or evade attacks, so their difficulty is based more on skill.</li>

<ul>
<li>Due to the above-mentioned changes in perks, we renamed the Stealth skill tree to Ninjutsu in order to better reflect the perks it contains.</li>
<li>Made the bonuses dynamic for 200% Efficiency, Field Technician and Cutting Edge. They are now applied to already crafted weapons and clothes. Respecing perks removes the bonuses correctly.</li>

<ul>
<li>V is now able to vault/climb/jump/sprint through glass that has been fractured.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Weapons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reworked throwing knives - knives are not lost after each throw, but automatically return to V&#39;s hands after a set cooldown time (dependent of knife rarity). It&#39;s also possible to pick up thrown knives, resetting the cooldown.</li>

<li>Crunch, Cold Shoulder and Pax weapon mods will increase weapon damage by a percentage value.</li>
