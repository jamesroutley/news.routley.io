<p>Hello everyone! We are pleased to announce the formation of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://w4games.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://w4games.com/" target="_blank"><strong>W4 Games</strong></a>, a new company created by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://godotengine.org/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Godot Engine</strong></a> veterans Juan Linietsky, RÃ©mi Verschelde and Fabio Alessandrelli, and veteran entrepreneur Nicola Farronato.</p>



<p>W4 Games was formed to strengthen the Godot ecosystem by providing both enterprise and independent developers with a complementary suite of commercial products and services to successfully develop and publish video games to all existing platforms in the market. Further announcements about these products and services will be made over the coming weeks and months as they become available.</p>



<p>As part of our development philosophy we want to give back to Godot wherever possible. Throughout the development of our products we will be open sourcing as much as we can, including additions to Godot that strengthen the engine. Stay tuned for relevant announcements on this topic in the coming days!</p>



<p>For now, please check out our <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://w4games.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://w4games.com/" target="_blank">home page</a></strong> for basic information about the company and check out our <strong><a href="https://w4games.com/faq/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://w4games.com/faq/">FAQ</a></strong> if you have any further questions.</p>



<p>Importantly, we strongly believe in Godot as a totally free and open source project, and we will not compromise those beliefs. W4 Games is here to provide products and services that cannot be provided by a free and open source project, but are necessary for corporate users as well as self-publishing individuals to fully enjoy Godot.</p>



<p>We are excited to be here and to strengthen the Godot ecosystem by ensuring that larger studios and companies can acquire the support they need to use Godot. We hope you share in our excitement.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further announcements and job postings!</p>
