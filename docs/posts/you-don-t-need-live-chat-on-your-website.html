    <h1>You don&#39;t need live chat on your website</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>More and more website has started adding “Live chat” to their websites. It usually says something along the lines of:</p><blockquote><p>Hi! My name is Blah Blah, let me know if I can help you…</p></blockquote><p>Or it can try to sell you something:</p><blockquote><p>Hi! We are running this bad campaign for something you don’t need…</p></blockquote><p>And almost every time I see this “nagging” I want to leave the website. It reminds me of going to a clothing store and before I’m able to get inside an employee asks me if I need help finding anything. The difference here is that the employee is able to be nice about it when I kindly say I’m just browsing, but the “Live chat” usually reminds me every time I load a new page.</p><p>When I go to shop online I can’t think of a reason why I go to a website and want to talk to someone in a “<em>live</em>” chat, that isn’t even live 😅 I want to find the items I need and move on with my day. If I need assistance, I will most likely do one of the following:</p><ul><li>Find a support e-mail.</li><li>Go to a physical store.</li><li>Ask a friend.</li><li>See if I find an unintrusive live chat that I chose to enable.</li></ul><p>So if you need to have a “Live chat” on your website, you probably need to do something about your website’s content, because most likely people are having a hard time finding what they’re looking for. Your website should solve a problem for your visitors, not add more.</p></div></article></div></div>
