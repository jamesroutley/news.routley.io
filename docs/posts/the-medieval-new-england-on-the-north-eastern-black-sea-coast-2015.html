Although the name &#39;New England&#39; is now firmly associated with the east coast of America, this is not the first place to be called that. In the medieval period there was another <i>Nova Anglia</i>, &#39;New England&#39;, and it lay far to the east of England, rather than to the west, in the area of the Crimean peninsula. The following post examines some of the evidence relating to this colony, which was said to have been established by Anglo-Saxon exiles after the Norman conquest of 1066 and seems to have survived at least as late as the thirteenth century.</p></div></div>
