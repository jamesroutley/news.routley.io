£15 per month.</b></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A monthly heated steering wheel subscription costs £10.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Subscriptions have been available for features on BMW cars for some time in the UK, but the heated seat offer started this month.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The company says customers can enable all hardware features for a one-time payment if they prefer.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The features are available via BMW&#39;s ConnectedDrive online store and are activated remotely, with no need to visit a dealer.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The heated seat offer is available in the UK, but the subscriptions that are available vary by country.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The manufacturer told the BBC that &#34;where heated seats, or any feature available in the ConnectedDrive store have been purchased when a customer vehicle is ordered, no subsequent subscription or payment is necessary&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the company argues that the ability to add new features can be helpful for owners who change their minds after purchase.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And it is particularly useful, BMW wrote, for second-hand car owners, &#34;as they now have the opportunity to add features the original owner did not choose&#34;.  </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source,

also enable drivers to &#34;experiment with a feature by purchasing a short-term trial before committing to a purchase&#34;, the company added.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, unlimited use of a feature can be purchased. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For £200, those with chilly hands can enjoy a warm wheel for &#34;as long as the technical prerequisites are met for this vehicle&#34;.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Hot-debate"><span role="text">Hot debate</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The news has sparked online debate, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/12/23204950/bmw-subscriptions-microtransactions-heated-seats-feature">with news site The Verge saying:</a> &#34;In the case of heated seats, for example, BMW owners already have all the necessary components, but BMW has simply placed a software block on their functionality that buyers then have to pay to remove.&#34;</p></div><div

Register</a> said that while it could work as a way for owners to add features as they can afford them, &#34;on the other hand, it may feel like buying a mug and having to rent the

comments on social media too, <a href="https://twitter.com/Drachiri/status/1547222501029199872">with one Twitter user writing:</a> &#34;Subscriptions for software is one thing, no-one is going to subscribe for heated seats or whatever, if I own the car I own everything in it.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>And Kurt Opsahl, general counsel of digital civil liberties campaign group the Electronic Frontier Foundation, <a href="https://twitter.com/kurtopsahl/status/1546905005436809216">tweeted:</a> &#34;A seat heater blocked by software is broken, and the car owner should have the right to repair their seats.&#34; </p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
