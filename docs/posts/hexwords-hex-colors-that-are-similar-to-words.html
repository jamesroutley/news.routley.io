    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div dir="auto"><p>This word is a confluence of several things. Fundamentally it is a brand. I’m firmly of the opinion that the best band name is the one you came up with a year ago while you were on a hike with your parents. That unhinged pun your college roommate joked you could name your future son. A string of syllables that came from some conversation you don’t even remember anymore, but that just sounds cool.</p><p><text>The meaning will come later. It will </text><em>not</em><text> come after the third practice when everyone sits down to brainstorm. If you’ve all done it a few times before then you can skip the awkward debates about whether it’s deep enough or trying to be too deep. You know the name acquires its own meaning on its own terms, and your job upfront is to lay fertile soil, nothing more.</text></p><p>Outerloper. A word that is easy to spell, sounds like a real word but isn’t one itself, is relatively unclaimed as a brand, and inspires my imagination when I hear it.

I had planned for months to be there with a vague intention to give a talk about Buddhism As First-Person Science, but in the days leading up to the event, I shrank. Scholars debate the exact cause, but it is widely agreed that I was depressed and exhausted.

Regardless, the result was that I did not prepare a talk, and came quite close to not attending the event.</text></p><p>Social tides brought me along absent my own intention, and much to my surprise, as folks came and shared and went, I felt something welling and added my name to the list. I opened with some painful honesty:</p><blockquote><p>I have a bit of a tendency to be a lurker in communities. Originally, I was on the website with a bio and everything, and it’s been a series of steps of becoming more and more invisible since then, up to not being sure I’d come tonight. […] I imagine there are probably others who are fighting a similar tendency in order to be here right now. […] Anyway, for that reason I have nothing prepared.</p></blockquote><p>I went on to awkwardly mention first-person science then babble about transferable skills from fighting games and tautological traffic signs.</p><p>This turned out to be a major turning point for me. I had spent several months teetering on a fence separating two pastures: </p><ol><li><p>Drive my truck into the Mojave with my dog. Spend my days meditating and reading books, returning to private land only to resupply and attend weddings.</p></li><li><p>Cut north back to the bay and try to rebuild something more like the life I’d left behind, a life of science and status and involvement.</p></li></ol><p>The easiest story to tell is that the moment I dropped my inhibitions enough to start speaking was the moment my balance left me.</p><p>Fuck you, dad.

A farce. He&#39;ll one day birth the riddle&#39;s snake–
in flesh, in blood, unleashed of thoughts and code.
The hero asks, &#34;was this the only way?&#34;
and time laments to bear the tragic news:
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
of meat. No death with dignity for fools.

&#34;From whence your strength?&#34; I must yet ask the king.
I am no Pharaoh, Shelley, Moore, or Veidt–
not but a hand that draws a hand and sings.
To rise, I will look past the graph and out

We’re going to Mars.</p><p>I returned, in so many words. It was, in a word, overstimulating. Years outside had made me soft. I’d forgotten how oppressive proximity to excellence can be. But although my focus had pivoted, I hadn’t stopped working in my years away, and I’d made the call: I was going to contribute, however that may look. I had obliterated my cloying need for validation of my intelligence and I didn’t fucking care where I slept at night as long as my dog could sleep there with me. Home is where the cops aren’t. Surely this admits some sort of comparative advantage?</p><p><text>So I scoured the networks for somewhere I could fit. There wasn’t somewhere I could fit, because my whole shtick was bringing cross-disciplinary perspectives </text><em>that people wouldn’t have already thought of</em><text>, and I guess I was too tired to muster the executive functioning needed to put two and two together and change the plan.</text></p><p><text>There were rare days where I found the brief freedom to say two plus two equals </text><code>x</code><text> for some value of </text><code>x</code><text>. I had resolved to start writing, because I definitely had something to say even if the longer I spent in Berkeley the more garbled it seemed to be. From a draft prepared in that era:</text></p><blockquote><p>I want to have a good relationship with any notions of other people finding value here. Crucial points:</p><ul><li><p>I do want people to find value.</p></li><li><p>I do think enough people will find value to justify the effort on that basis alone.</p></li><li><p>If I turn out to be wrong, I want to be open to and aware of that fact.</p></li><li><p>If I turn out to be wrong, I want to respond skillfully.</p></li></ul><p>Responding skillfully would mean using whatever new information I’ve acquired to choose between changing my writing to have more impact, not continuing to write, or changing my writing to prioritize impact less, relative to other considerations. […] It may ironically be a better way to achieve impact in the long run too, to be less focused on outcomes of writing and more on the experiential process of writing things that are useful to me.</p></blockquote><p>I’ll spare you the other twenty pages of this. I was stuck in a loop of convincing myself and everyone around me that there was a good reason for me to be writing, and when I tried to write that was all I could write about.</p><p><text>My current model for what was happening, at least in part, was that I had a war waging in my </text><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/pC6DYFLPMTCbEwH8W/p/rYJKvagRYeDM8E9Rf" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Prune module</a><text>.

At each step, to pick the next word, I randomly generate words in the category (correct part of speech, relevance) and sound them out one by one to see which continues the sentence most coherently. So, instead of deliberately and carefully generating sentences in one go, the algorithm is something like:</p><ol><li><p>Babble. Use a weak and local filter to randomly generate a lot of possibilities. Is the word the right part of speech? Does it lie in the same region of thingspace? Does it fit the context?</p></li><li><p>Prune. Use a strong and global filter to test for the best, or at least a satisfactory, choice. With this word in the blank, do I actually believe this sentence? Does the word have the right connotations? Does the whole thought read smoothly?</p></li></ol></blockquote><p><text>I had these two deeply fleshed-out ideological internal selves roughly aligned with Effective Altruism and </text><a href="https://www.mctb.org/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">MCTB</a><text> Theravada Buddhism, respectively, both with strong moral and epistemic convictions, fighting over the controls. Would I hop back on the AI research grind, but this time with impervious mental health? Would I go to a monastery to work toward the liberation of all beings and the transcendence of dukkha, aided by the power of decision theory? Would I do something in between and join these feral scientists synthesizing new psychedelics and overhauling the academic publishing game?</text></p><p>In some sense the apparently reasonable answer, if limited to these, is the third one. But these two systems are totalizing, hegemonic, and the internal theater of this conflict was not debate-shaped nor anything nearly so collaborative; instead, there were these dueling compulsions to strike down expression of anything that could sound too rationalist or too woo, and an arms race for each of these fighters to discover a perfect argument that would destroy the other in its own terms.</p><p>From the outside, this looked like a person who clearly believed on some level that they had good ideas, but who got bizarrely uncomfortable and confused every time you asked a question about them.

People with families.</p><p>He dreams.</p><p>But the light eludes him, and he can’t fathom a life without Seeking.</p><p>The skilled outerloper sits on his perch. Below, a village. Above, a peak. Beyond, a vast unknowable landscape filled with Strange And Beautiful Things.</p><p>He has brought something with him. A Spherical Sentence.</p><blockquote><p><code>a puzzle: Spherical Sentences are a Very Geometric Type, because they Readily Admit a puzzle.</code></p></blockquote><p>A silly thing, really, but a Strange And Beautiful one too.</p><p>“In the mood for a puzzle?” he asks.</p><p>“Always,” they always say.</p><p>“The puzzle is privately owned and controlled by a DAO. I currently hold 51% of the tokens.”</p><p>The merchant doesn’t bite too hard once he realizes the puzzle involves magick. He had been scolded far too many times in grade school to believe that he was capable of the powers same as anyone else. He and the outerloper talk about wolf husbandry.</p><p>“People get so hung up on whether the beast follows your instructions. It’s a distraction. Far more important to build a reliable internal model of his attention dynamics if you want to shape his behavior to suit your needs. Wolves are eager to please, they just don’t know how. Obedience is never going to be enough.”</p><p>That night, the outerloper dines with the merchant’s family. One of the merchant’s children is in the mood for a puzzle, and unlocks several achievements over the course of the evening.</p><p>The outerloper leaves. Maybe he’ll be back.</p><div id="footnote-1"><p><a href="#footnote-anchor-1" contenteditable="false" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">1</a></p><p><text>It is worth noting that this theory is losing favor among the academic community in the wake of </text><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01663" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">groundbreaking work</a><text> out of </text><a href="https://www.redwoodresearch.org/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Redwood Research</a><text>.

Seems to me that LW Rationality is something closer to 4.5 than to 4 in Chapman’s staging, and that what he calls rationality is a different thing (in most places farther away from LW, a more standard use of the term). LW has already patched a bunch of the problems he talks about “rationality” having, but not all of them, and Chapman’s Stage 5 meta-rationality is a third different thing. And is better. Low-to-mid confidence in all of this, but god damn it I have a take and now you’ve heard it.</p></div></div></div></div>
