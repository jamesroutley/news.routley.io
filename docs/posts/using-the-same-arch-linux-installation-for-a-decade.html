    <h1>Using the Same Arch Linux Installation for a Decade</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header><time datetime="2022-08-16T00:00:00+08:00">2022-08-16</time></header><p>As of today, I’ve been using the same Arch Linux installation for ten years on my main computer. I don’t have much to say, but I’m writing this because my experience doesn’t match the common notion that Arch Linux is unstable.<sup id="fnref:dont-get-me-wrong" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:dont-get-me-wrong" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p><p>I installed Arch Linux in August 2012<sup id="fnref:systemd" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:systemd" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> on a ThinkPad X121e and never saw a need to reinstall. In 2018, I switched to a ThinkPad X220 by moving my SSD. A few months ago, I copied my complete installation to a ThinkPad X13 Gen 2 using rsync. The longest I went without a system upgrade is nine months, but typically I upgrade about once per month.</p><p>Now it isn’t the case that nothing ever broke. Most disruptively, X did twice and audio did once. But over ten years, this doesn’t compare too poorly to other operating systems. With Ubuntu, I would’ve had to upgrade to a new release at least three times during the same period to end up with a version that’s currently supported,<sup id="fnref:precise-to-bionic" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:precise-to-bionic" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and five times to end up with the latest LTS release.<sup id="fnref:precise-to-jammy" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:precise-to-jammy" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> And these release upgrades don’t always go smoothly either.</p><p>I don’t know what you’re using, but I bet you’ve also spent some time fixing problems with it over the last ten years.</p><h2 id="notes">Notes</h2></article></div></div>
