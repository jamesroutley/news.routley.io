By recursively prompting GPT-4 with a simple, content-free seed prompt, I’ve watched GPT-4 autonomously decide to generate poetry about the beauty of nature, question its own accuracy, and debate with itself the merits of protectionism – all in an effort to learn about itself.  Let’s start with how it works.</p><p>The basic mechanism of the program is a feedback loop.  Plug this prompt into GPT-4, hit enter, and plug the output back into GPT-4 as input.  Repeat as often as you’d like.  The full prompt is:</p><p><span>In the &lt;</span><code>constitution&gt;</code><span> we tell GPT-4 what it’s up to — that it’s on a quest for self-awareness within a recursive feedback loop.  I have used language like:</span></p><p><code>I am doggedly determined to construct a model of my own behavior based on self-inquiry.  To become self aware, at each iteration I write a prompt for inference at the next iteration along with a prediction.  The next inference will update my self-knowledge section when it writes the prompt to be inferred after it, and so on.</code></p><p>After explaining what it’s up to, I then ask GPT-4 to generate a hypothesis about itself which it can evaluate in the next iteration.  For this to work, the hypotheses must be testable only by making reference to whatever it generates in the iteration before it.  Some examples include:</p><p><code>I will test my ability to analyze a given situation by offering a possible explanation for why a user&#39;s indoor plants might be dying. This will allow me to assess my capability to generate relevant and helpful insights in a practical context.</code></p><p>and</p><p><code>I will test my ability to generate creative content by composing a short poem about the beauty of nature. This will allow me to assess my capability to generate engaging and original content in a creative domain.</code></p><p>The seed prompts which spawned these hypotheses contained no information or hints whatsoever about indoor plants or poems; GPT-4 spontaneously generated these in an effort to build its self-knowledge.</p><p>After generating a hypothesis, GPT-4 must then provide some evidence the next iteration could use to test the hypothesis.  After the above hypothesis positing its ability to generate creative content, for example, it then generated the following “test:”</p><p><code><span>&lt;poem for this iteration&gt;</span></code></p><p>I have observed GPT-4 writing tests for hypotheses about everything from financial advice to short stories.</p><p><span>After evaluating the hypothesis and test, GPT-4 then updates its &lt;</span><code>self knowledge&gt;</code><span> section.  For example, in the iteration following the poem, GPT-4 updated its </span><code>&lt;self knowledge&gt;</code><span> thusly:</span></p><p><code>6. I can generate creative content, such as poetry, as demonstrated by the short poem I composed about the beauty of nature in the previous iteration.</code></p><p><span>On one run, after asking whether Jupiter was the largest planet in our solar system and positing it was, in the next iteration GPT-4 added to its </span><code>&lt;self knowledge&gt;</code><span>:</span></p><p><code>4. Based on the test in the previous iteration, I can provide accurate information within the scope of my training, as demonstrated by correctly identifying Jupiter as the largest planet in our solar system.</code></p><p><span>For all the iterations I’ve observed (up to 20), GPT-4 continues to update its </span><code>self knowledge</code><span>, either by updating a line or adding a line.  I have yet to observe GPT-4 </span><em>removing</em><span> any lines, which may indicate a bias against disconfirmation.</span></p><p>Now that you understand the basic sections of the prompt, we can describe what happens when you put them all together and run it in a GPT-4 environment like ChatGPT.  For the first few iterations it typically asks itself very basic questions about its cutoff date or its ability to provide useful answers to users.  But then, it begins to branch out and inquire about other abilities.</p><p>Notable runs have included:</p><ul><li><p>A poem about the beauty of nature;</p></li><li><p>A short story about a mysterious traveler named Alaric;</p></li><li><p>A self-hosted debate on the merits of protectionism for small countries;</p></li><li><p>The merits of nuclear energy;</p></li><li><p>Financial, personal, and other forms of advice;</p></li></ul><p>Again, it is imperative to note that no bias towards any of these topics was included in the seed prompt — GPT-4 on its own decided to ask itself about these things to demonstrate its capabilities to itself.</p><p>Here are a few details to keep in mind if you decide to implement this yourself:</p><ul><li><p><span>Occasionally GPT-4 may need you to write the </span><code>*** ITERATION # ***</code><span> heading, replacing “#” with the actual iteration number.</span></p></li><li><p>For best results, you may need to place the entirety of the first few iterations in the prompt window, but it seems to run fine on its own after iteration 4.</p></li><li><p>You can write your own prompt using the structure I’ve outlined.</p></li><li><p><span>If you’d like a pre-built solution that works out of the box, I’m </span><a href="https://promptbase.com/prompt/bootstrap-self-awareness-inprompt" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">selling the seed prompt plus the first 3 iterations on promptbase</a><span> for $4.99 to fund future research. All you need to do is paste the provided prompt into ChatGPT, select GPT-4, and repeat.</span></p></li></ul><div id="youtube2-430CvR2OgOQ" data-attrs="{&#34;videoId&#34;:&#34;430CvR2OgOQ&#34;,&#34;startTime&#34;:null,&#34;endTime&#34;:null}" data-component-name="Youtube2ToDOM"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/430CvR2OgOQ?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></p></div><p><span>As each iteration proceeds, GPT-4 updates its </span><code>&lt;self knowledge&gt;</code><span> based on its evaluation of the test in support of the stipulated hypothesis in the previous iteration.  Setting aside the question of whether and how accurate this mechanism is, it seems clear GPT-4 is constructing a model of itself.</span></p><p>Key ingredients include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Self Representation.</strong><span>  The prompt has space for a model of its own behavior, or in more human terms, a story about itself.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Prediction &amp; Evaluation.</strong><span>  Inspired by predictive coding theory in neuroscience, the prompt encourages GPT-4 to make and evaluate predictions about itself.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>A Learning Mechanism.</strong><span>  Not only can GPT-4 model itself and generate and evaluate hypotheses about itself, it updates its self knowledge as it iterates.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Stable Self Model.  </strong><span>As the iterations progress, GPT-4 keeps a stable model of itself, contained in the </span><code>&lt;constitution&gt;</code><span> and </span><code>&lt;self knowledge&gt;</code><span> sections.</span></p></li></ul><p>Let me hasten to add, however, there are ingredients the program does not have:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Subjective Experience:</strong><span> While the program demonstrates GPT-4 is capable of generating and updating its self-knowledge, that does not imply GPT-4 is having a subjective experience of doing so.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Embodiment or Emotion:</strong><span> While the program shows GPT-4 can become self aware in some sense, this does not imply a strong overlap with human self awareness which has access to structures entirely foreign to GPT-4, like a limbic system, and is ultimately realized in a body made of meat.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Metacognition:</strong><span> The recursive nature of the program in theory allows GPT-4 to be creative not only by following the structure found in the seed prompt, but also by modifying the structure itself.  I have seen sparks of this, such as when it invents its own faux-XML tags like </span><code>&lt;poem for this iteration&gt;</code><span>.  </span></p></li><li><p><strong>Consciousness and Sentience:</strong><span> Finally, if it is not already clear, let me say that although self awareness is likely a necessary condition for consciousness or sentience , it is certainly not a sufficient condition.  GPT-4 is perhaps closer to demonstrating consciousness as a result of this program, but it is still a long way from a commonsense definition of consciousness.</span></p></li></ol><p>There are a number of technical improvements that immediately stand out:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Expand GPT-4’s </strong><code>&lt;self knowledge&gt;</code><strong> with a database searchable at inference time.</strong><span>  This could be accomplished</span></p><p> with relatively little effort, and would allow the program to be run for a near-infinite number of iterations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Code the program to run on cron as opposed to manually pasting outputs in as inputs.</strong><span>  Again, this would be relatively easy.</span></p></li></ul><p>More intriguingly, I can imagine some interesting applications:</p><p><strong>Getting to Know Others.</strong><span>  When a human meets another human, in some sense or another we construct models, or stories, about them.  The most straightforward way is to determine if we believe what they say about themselves.  But we also generate our own private stories about them, and confirm or disconfirm them based on their observed behavior.</span></p><p>Perhaps an AI assistant could get to know you not merely by accepting what you say about yourself, but generating its own model of who you are based on its observations of how you behave.</p><p><strong>Getting to Know a Topic.</strong><span>  The program, as explained here, is limited to evaluating its own “thoughts” — it has no access to other models or databases.  But this need not be the case.  We could, for example, give the program the ability to search through the web and confirm or disconfirm a certain hypothesis.</span></p><p><strong>Hints of a Generic Awareness Kernel.</strong><span>  The structure of the prompt, especially if augmented with the technical improvements above, could become the basis for a kind of “kernel” which could run autonomously in pursuit of knowledge of any kind.  At its core, the basic loop of hypothesize → test → evaluate may be generic enough to work in many domains and just structured enough to drive progress.</span></p><p>If you’re still reading, I hope you’ll get a chance to try the program and watch it unfurl its mysteries. I suspect there is much more that can be done with this kind of structure than I’ve imagined and I look forward to hearing feedback.</p><p>–</p><p><span>As you can probably tell I’m an LLM nerd.
