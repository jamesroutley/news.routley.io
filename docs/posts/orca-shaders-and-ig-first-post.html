    <h1>ORCA, shaders, and IG (first post)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="quartz-root" class="page"><div id="quartz-body"><div><article><p>This is mostly a test post, but I did a quick render of my ORCA live set at the Recurse Center Talent Show this past Friday, and put it alongside a lissajous curve shader I’ve been working on for a bit.</p>
<p>Early in my time at RC, I developed <a href="https://codepen.io/rwhaling/full/MYWywyK">this P5.js sketch<svg aria-hidden="true" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a>, which displaces a lissajous curve (plotting sines and cosines in radians, basically) with perlin noise, and people really enjoyed it.  The more time I spend with it, I feel like this is the kind of algorithmic/mathematical thing that I could use dozens of times, in many different ways, and the shader below is an attempt to adapt it to the gradient/noise workflow I had toward the end of my time at RC.</p>
<p>In lieu of a full explanation of what a lissajous curve is or what it means to displace it, I’ll link to this sketch that breaks it down a bit: <a href="https://codepen.io/rwhaling/full/yyLONeY">https://codepen.io/rwhaling/full/yyLONeY<svg aria-hidden="true" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a> as well as this Daniel Shiffman video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--6eyLO78CY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=—6eyLO78CY<svg aria-hidden="true" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a></p>
<p>The source code is extremely messy - I tend to copypasta parts between a bunch of different repos as I work, so this has a ton of unused files, no README, etc., but wanted to at least get it out there.  <a href="https://github.com/rwhaling/lissajous_two">https://github.com/rwhaling/lissajous_two<svg aria-hidden="true" style="max-width:0.8em;max-height:0.8em;" viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M320 0H288V64h32 82.7L201.4 265.4 178.7 288 224 333.3l22.6-22.6L448 109.3V192v32h64V192 32 0H480 320zM32 32H0V64 480v32H32 456h32V480 352 320H424v32 96H64V96h96 32V32H160 32z"></path></svg></a></p>
<p>I’m going to try a few different things out in terms of embedding this kind of content, but relying on IG and other sites as my primary media stores, for video, and embedding it here, probably makes the most sense?</p>
<p>More generally - RC was an incredible opportunity for me to push my creative practice forward, and I would like to get back in the habit of documenting and sharing things I make again.</p>
<p>What I’m maybe most interested to see is how IG engagements are?  I posted this here a few hours ago, and I feel like I get way more plays and likes on cell-phone quality videos of my synths, or just video of ORCA itself, than I do on the (in my opinion) much prettier shader output.</p>
