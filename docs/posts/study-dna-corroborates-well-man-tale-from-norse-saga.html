<p>Archaeologists first excavated the well in 1938 and found parts of a human body at its base under several boulders. Additional excavations didn&#39;t occur until 2014 and 2016, yielding even more new body parts. “This is the first time that a person described in these historical texts has actually been found,” <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1061746?">said co-author Michael D. Martin</a> of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology’s University Museum in Trondheim, Norway. “There are a lot of these medieval and ancient remains all around Europe, and they’re increasingly being studied using genomic methods.”</p>
<p>Osteological analyses from 2014 and 2016 indicated that the remains were those of a man between 30 and 40 years of age. The left arm was missing, but excavators did find the man&#39;s left-hand fingers, as well as the skull, detached from the upper torso. There were signs of severe trauma, but researchers couldn&#39;t determine whether those injuries occurred before or after death. However, there was a blunt-force injury to the back of the skull, along with two sharp cuts, that are unlikely to be postmortem and could be the cause of death. Radiocarbon dating of the bones indicated the remains were about 940 years old, give or take 30 years, consistent with the Well-man&#39;s time period.</p>
<h2>It’s in the DNA</h2>
<p>Martin and his co-authors sought to gain additional information about the remains by sequencing the Well-man&#39;s genome in hopes of learning more about his ancestry and physical characteristics in particular. They were able to extract DNA from a single premolar tooth taken from the mandible. The tooth&#39;s cementum and enamel were removed, the tooth was ground into powder, and the sample was zapped with UV radiation to ensure it wasn&#39;t contaminated. To determine ancestry, the team compared the Well-man&#39;s DNA to a database of more than 6,000 modern-day Norwegians.</p>
