As of Friday, more than 190 company-owned Starbucks locations have voted to unionize, according to National Labor Relations Board data. Workers have cited unsafe working conditions, understaffing and unreliable scheduling as some of the reasons why they&#39;re in favor of a union.</p><p>Before joining Starbucks, Narasimhan was chief executive of Reckitt, which owns brands like Lysol and Durex.
