    <h1>What&#39;s making me happy 2024-02-29</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here&#39;s me trying to get two<!-- --> <a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/tag/happy">#happy</a> posts out in one month! It was my birthday last week. I had a great time, but a few days later as a late birthday present, I got norovirus from the Earth. Feeling better now, but yay!</p>
<p>TV &amp; Movies</p>
<ul>
<li>I rewatched all of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lasso">Ted Lasso</a> while recovering, so that was fun. Show holds up.</li>
<li>I started watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_Rouge">Metallic Rouge</a>. It&#39;s by the illustrious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bones_(studio)">Studio Bones</a>, and so far it&#39;s beautiful and completely inscrutable.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One">F1</a> is back this weekend, as is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_1:_Drive_to_Survive#Season_6_(2024)">Drive to Survive Season 6</a>. So far DTS has been fantastic. It&#39;s just a reality show about rich people and its absurdity is wonderful. Excited for the racing to begin again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Music</p>
<ul>
<li>Got a few records as gifts for my birthday, which I&#39;ve been slowly listening through. I had forgotten how amazing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syro">Syro</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_Is_Love_in_You">There Is Love in You</a> are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/HDMI-2.1-OSS-Rejected">HDMI Forum Rejects Open-Source HDMI 2.1 Driver Support Sought By AMD</a> made me incredibly angry. I know this is supposed to be happy posts, but the only reason I&#39;m happy is that there are people willing to fight for years (this attempt was 3+ years in the making) to try and make sure open source works for all.</li>
<li>I started <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63104676-the-atlas-complex">The Atlas Complex</a>. So far it&#39;s well written but very confusing, not sure if I&#39;ll finish.</li>
<li><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2024/02/16/popular-git-config-options/">Popular git config options</a> taught me a lot of cool git config tricks. In particular I enjoyed setting up <a href="https://gist.github.com/Icaruk/f024a18093dc28ec1588cfb90efc32f7">multiple git profiles</a>, so I can finally have separate emails and PGP keys based on what parent folder I&#39;m in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Play</p>
<ul>
<li>I started playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slay_the_Spire">Slay the Spire</a>. Lots of fun, and has a good gameplay loop. I&#39;ve been playing on PS5, but it&#39;s on a lot of the platforms.</li>
