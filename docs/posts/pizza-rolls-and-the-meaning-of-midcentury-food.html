rolls?" rel="">Are pizza rolls good?</a></p></li></ol><p>The person who posted the first question added a bit of context to start the situation: “I have seen some images and heard about it, but is it just tomato sauce with cheese in bread?”</p><p>And, yeah, that’s pretty much it—there can certainly be other things in the filling (pepperoni, for example), but the basic concept is “tiny calzone.” It’s easy to understand why this would seem ridiculous at first glance, especially when the traditional place to find pizza rolls is a plastic bag in the freezer section of a big-box grocery store.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

His father worked in iron ore mines and sold homebrew wine; his mother ran a small shop where she sold homemade pasta sauce and other products. Money was always tight—</span><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_World_on_a_Plate/S_x6nrkcoUkC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=%22paulucci%22" rel="">in one of his books, Paulucci recalled that their apartment had a single lightbulb and an abundance of cockroaches</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>As a young man, Paulucci took a job in a lumberyard in Aurora, but by the early 1940s, he had moved out of the blue-collar world and gotten into sales, </span><a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/media/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/chun-king" rel="">traveling around the region on behalf of a food wholesaler</a><span>. </span></p><p><span>At the time, Chinese food was spreading around the USA (</span><a href="https://www.snackstack.net/p/the-snack-that-embodies-midcentury" rel="">a topic we’ve previously discussed in </a><em><a href="https://www.snackstack.net/p/the-snack-that-embodies-midcentury" rel="">Snack Stack, </a></em><a href="https://www.snackstack.net/p/the-snack-that-embodies-midcentury" rel="">in the Chinese chicken fingers post from 2021</a><span>). Dishes like chow mein and chop suey had already entered the national lexicon and</span><em> </em><span>eating them was a mark of sophistication. </span><a href="https://www.christies.com/features/Chop-Suey-by-Edward-Hopper-9407-3.aspx" rel="">Even Edward Hopper got in on the trend with one of his paintings. </a><span>In his book </span><em>Ten Restaurants That Changed America, </em><span>historian Paul Freedman observes that “exotic home cooking followed in the wake of the rise of Chinese restaurants as Chinese food became a central part of American dining in the interwar and postwar years.”</span></p><p><span>Paulucci was one of the cuisine’s many fans. But the young salesman noticed a gap in the market: there wasn’t much in the way of prepackaged canned or frozen Chinese foods in the USA and those that did exist were, he thought, too bland. </span><a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_World_on_a_Plate/S_x6nrkcoUkC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=%22paulucci%22" rel="">So he borrowed $2,500 from friends and family and had his mom develop some new recipes for him—which essentially meant that she added Italian seasonings to chop suey and chow mein—and started selling the products. </a></p><p><span>Consumers loved it.
