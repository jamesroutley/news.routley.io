<p><span>The caterpillar’s metamorphosis from a tree-clinging, 12-legged pest into the majestic flying butterfly is a frequent metaphor for</span> dramatic<span> transformations. It’s truly a fantastic mechanism developed by nature. Yet, while it may seem fantastic from the outside, this transformation looks pretty gruesome deep inside the caterpillar’s chrysalis. </span></p>



<p><span>For a caterpillar to turn into a butterfly, it digests itself using enzymes triggered by hormones. Then, sleeping cells (similar to stem cells) grow into the body parts of the future butterfly. So you thought puberty was mean? Wait till you read on</span> about the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly. </p>

<p><span>Our story begins with an egg laid by a female butterfly. These eggs are typically small and round, and can be found on the leaves of plants. Once the eggs hatch, out comes the baby caterpillar. Soon enough, the little caterpillar (scientifically known as a larva) stuffs itself with leaves, growing little by little. </span>They eat leaves voraciously and can grow up to a hundred times their original size.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent -->
 





<p><span>When they’ve outgrown their current skin, a hormone called ecdysone is released, instructing the larva to molt. After it molts about five times, the larva stops feeding, hangs upside down from a twig or <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/natural-sciences/biology-reference/plants/leaf-galls/">leaf</a>, and then either spins a silky cocoon or molts into a shiny chrysalis. This stage in the caterpillar’s life cycle is known as pupation. This process is driven by the same hormone, ecdysone, but this time it works in conjunction with the action of another hormone called the juvenile hormone. It’s actually the lack of the juvenile hormone that triggers the metamorphosis mechanism.</span></p>

<p>The process of metamorphosis can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months, depending on the species of butterfly. During this time, the butterfly is vulnerable to predators and environmental factors that can impede its development. But for those that make it through, the end result is a creature of unparalleled beauty and grace.<span></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is little footage that shows metamorphosis at work. The incredible photo pictured above was shot by Michael Cook, who managed to catch this Tussah silkmoth (<em>Antheraea penyi</em>) in a rare position – during a failed attempt to spin its cocoon. You can see the delicate, translucent jade wings, antennae, and legs of a pupa that has not yet matured into an adult moth—a glimpse of what usually remains concealed within the cocoon.</p>



<p>Luckily, we live in the 21st century. Using modern imaging tech, like CT scans, <a href="https://www.zmescience.com/research/caterpillar-butterfly-metamorphosis-ct-3d-scan-65054/">we can peek inside the cocoon</a> without disturbing this extremely delicate process. The video below was shot by scientists working at London’s Natural History Museum.</p><!-- Tag ID: zmescience_300x250_InContent -->

<p>The metamorphosis of caterpillars into butterflies is a wonder of nature that never ceases to amaze. It’s a reminder of the incredible adaptability and resilience of these insects, and the vital role they play in the ecosystem. Next time you see a butterfly fluttering by, take a moment to appreciate the incredible journey it has undertaken to become the beautiful creature it is today.</p>
