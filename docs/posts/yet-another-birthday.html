<p>Thank you to everyone who’s been with me for the past year, especially to those who witnessed the ups and downs of my first year as CTO, to the wonderful people I got to meet and the equally wonderful people who stayed with me, and to my wife, who I got to celebrate our first anniversary with this year.</p>
<p>To a new year full of weird adventures! Buckle up!</p>
