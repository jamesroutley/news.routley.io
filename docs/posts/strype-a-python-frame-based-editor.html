It offers similar avoidance of syntax errors and discoverability as block-based systems, while providing readability and flexibility of editing similar to text editors.</p><p>Python-like programs are written by inserting frames, using a single key command, which represent a complete statement in the language. No syntax details need to be remembered, the speed of editing increases, freeing the programmer’s mind to concentrate on the task at hand.</p><p>By avoiding frustrating errors, Strype contributes to better progress of learners, quicker success, and more fun. Entirely keyboard-based editing options keep proficient users more productive and focused.</p><h3 id="watch-how-strype-works">Watch how Strype works</h3><figure><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3Oe-ZRt4n1I?rel=0&amp;cc_load_policy=1" allow="encrypted-media" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""><p>How Strype works</p></iframe></p><figcaption><p>King&#39;s College London</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id="moving-from-blocks-to-text-based-programming">Moving from blocks to text-based programming</h3><p>In a context of education, Strype provides an effective path for transitioning from blocks to full textual editors as it removes the burden of memorising some of the Python syntax. It gives users a chance to experiment with the core concepts of the language without getting distracted by some of the incidental detail. The frames of Strype closely match to Python constructs, so later progression to traditional Python editors is seamless.</p><h3 id="using-strype-with-the-micro:bit-environment">Using Strype with the micro:bit environment</h3><p>Strype for micro:bit has been specifically designed to assist writing and sending programs to the micro:bit board.</p><p>Strype frames provide autocompletion including the micro:bit API, and a discovery tool permits programmers to find key micro:bit API elements. Strype targets both micro:bit V1 and micro:bit V2.</p><p><img alt="Screenshot of the Strype editor" loading="lazy" width="653" height="328.8033509700176" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/ajwvhvgo/production/3d0e8521203a0157a130e6156e12eaf1a27f7bb3-1134x571.png?w=653&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format"/></p><p>The Strype environment provides interaction with the micro:bit, and can also convert the Strype code to either Hex or Python formats. The upload to micro:bit is based on the webUSB mechanism. If support of webUSB is not available from the browser, the Strype system provides alternative methods for uploading the code.</p><h3 id="design-for-learning">Design for learning</h3><p>Strype was developed by the Programming Education Group at King’s College London – the group that also developed the BlueJ and Greenfoot programming environments, and more recently designed Stride, a Java-based frame editor. The Strype editor is the latest system is a series of educational programming environments with which the group aims at making programming more accessible to a larger cohort of learners.</p><p>Strype will be presented at the international computing education conference, SIGCSE 22 Technical Symposium.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>Thanks to the team at King&#39;s College London for sharing their work on the Strype editor.
