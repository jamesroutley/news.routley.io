    <h1>Half of Russia&#39;s A320/A321neo Fleet Grounded Amid Engine Issues and Sanctions</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><strong>Half of the Airbus A320/A321neo aircraft operated in Russia</strong> are <strong>out of service</strong> due to technical issues. Out of a total of 66 aircraft of this family, <strong>34 have been grounded</strong>, and up to 20 of them may never return to operation, according to sources cited in a report by the Russian newspaper <em>Kommersant</em>.</p><p>The engines on these aircraft, the <strong>Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1100G and CFM LEAP</strong>, face maintenance challenges in the country due to their technological complexity and the inability to import spare parts, a direct result of Western sanctions and global market shortages. According to <em>Kommersant</em>, this situation could lead to a massive withdrawal of these aircraft starting in 2026, which would represent nearly 10% of the entire foreign fleet in Russia.</p><h4><strong>Impact on Airlines</strong></h4><p>The most affected airline is <strong>S7, with 31 of its 39 A320/A321neo out of service</strong>. Among these, eight A321neo have been parked since 2023, and 18 A320neo were gradually grounded this year. According to sources cited by <em>Kommersant</em>, the company plans to reserve these aircraft for use during the high season, although the engines of more than 20 planes are said to be «practically exhausted.»</p><p>Meanwhile, other airlines such as <strong>Aeroflot, Ural Airlines, North Wind, and Smartavia</strong> are facing similar problems, albeit on a smaller scale. Ural Airlines, for instance, has reduced the operational use of its A320/A321neo fleet to preserve engine life during the winter.</p><h4><strong>Operational Restrictions</strong></h4><p>The affected engines have been criticized for design flaws that require frequent maintenance. According to <em>Kommersant’s</em> analysis, <strong>LEAP engines show greater stability compared to the PW1100G</strong>, which require full overhauls at much shorter cycles than previous generations. However, both models face a complex situation in Russia, where local repairs are impossible, and importing the necessary components isn’t viable.</p><p>Furthermore, requests to export the engines to other countries for repair <strong>have been rejected</strong> by the Russian Ministry of Transport, according to the newspaper’s sources. The traceability of components and the limited availability of global maintenance facilities exacerbate the issue.</p><p>The impact of these groundings could result in a significant reduction in air traffic over the coming years. According to <em>Kommersant</em>, the withdrawal of the A320/A321neo at S7 could reduce its operational capacity by 10% to 15% in 2025. This decline could also affect passenger traffic across the Russian aviation industry if it is not offset by other aircraft.</p><h4><strong>Official Response</strong></h4><p>Following the publication of the report, Rosaviatsia, Russia’s aviation authority, confirmed in a statement that the issues with Pratt &amp; Whitney A320/A321neo engines are further complicated in Russia due to «unprecedented external sanctions pressure,» although these aircraft represent only 5% of local airlines’ fleets.</p></div></div>
