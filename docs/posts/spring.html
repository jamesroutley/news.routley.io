    <p>When I read a book or watch a TV show, I’m excited to get to a new chapter.
There’s more to discover, more to experience, and more to understand. So why
are new chapters in life so scary to me when the exact same can be said? It’s
hard for me to let go and move on, but I’m slowly progressing into a new
chapter of my life. I’m excited and scared about it, but it feels right. I miss
my previous chapter, but it’ll always be part of me. If I could go back though,
I wouldn’t. That’s not my place anymore.</p>

<p>I find the cycles of life so amazing. Everywhere you look there are cycles. The
sun rising and setting, monthly phases of the moon, seasons of the year, and
life and death. Looking at my own life, I start to see cycles too. Not just
obvious cycles (like meals, exercise, and sleep), but mental cycles too. My
interests, emotions, and motivations often ebb and flow. It’s quietly
reassuring knowing that life self regulates this way without much effort. If
I’m feeling unmotivated, I know I’ll eventually feel motivated again. This is
definitely an exercise in trust that I’ve had to learn as well. Sometimes only
by letting go will the cycle continue.</p>

<p>But how does this relate to new chapters? Changing the cycles and experiencing
new things. I don’t know the answer. Perhaps these cycles, being
self-perpetuating, make it harder to break out, like trying to free yourself
from a gravitational pull. As I said earlier, there’s comfort in cycles.
But there’s no growth in comfort and no comfort in growth.</p>

<p>I do think there are windows that make transitioning into new chapters
emotionally easier. Like two sine waves oscillating at different frequencies,
eventually they align for a short period, making the switch with minimal
effort. Although transitions may not always be easy and natural, I do believe
consistent repetition has a compounding effect. I often say that small
consistent steps will take you very far. Making changes is a lot easier for me
when they’re small, so that is what I’m trying to do now!</p>

<p>Ultimately, we’re all on our own journey. I think it’s important to celebrate
the windows where our frequencies temporarily align, whether it’s one hour or a
decade or more. Let’s enjoy those uniquely shared experiences.</p>
