  <p>If you like the look of it, it’s even cooler in <a href="https://www.c82.net/euclid/book1/"><strong>Nicholas Rougeur</strong>’s beautiful interactive version</a>.</p><p>This is a classic example of what <strong>Edward Tufte</strong>, the modern saint of visualization, calls a <em>visual explanation</em> (he wrote <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_visex">a whole book</a> about the subject). We’ve written about the subject before (for example, see Evan’s 2014 post, <a href="https://agilescientific.com/blog/2014/7/29/graphics-that-repay-careful-study.html"><em>Graphics that repay careful study</em></a>). Figures and charts should do more than merely illustrate, they should elucidate.</p><p><strong>Too often, equations — for example the myriad equations in any volume of GEOPHYSICS — do not elucidate. Indeed, they barely even illustrate. In some cases, it’s worse: they obfuscate. You might think mathematics is too dry, or too steeped in convention, for it to be any other way. Equations just <em>are</em>. But Byrne showed us that we can do better.</strong></p><p>A few years ago, in an attempt to broaden my geophysical knowledge, I bought a copy of <strong>Daniel Fleisch</strong>’s <a href="http://www.danfleisch.com/maxwell/">book on Maxwell’s equations</a>. It’s excellent, and the others in the series are good too. I especially liked the annotated equations; I’ve lightened the annotations in this version, to put them on a separate visual ‘layer’:</p>

<p><a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a> is interesting because the documents are runnable code. And this reminds us that mathematics — equations, data structures, and so on — has another expression: code. While symbolic representation speaks directly to some people, code speaks to others, probably more. Look at Randall Munroe’s annotation of a Wolfram Alpha equation (similar to an Excel formula) from his (wonderful) book, <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/85/"><em>What If</em></a>:</p>
