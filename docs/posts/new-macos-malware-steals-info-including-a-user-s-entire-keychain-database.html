                        <div id="articleBody" itemprop="articleBody">
                            <p>A new macOS malware—called MacStealer—that is capable of stealing various files, cryptocurrency wallets, and details stored in specific browsers like Firefox, Chrome, and Brave, was <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.uptycs.com/blog/macstealer-command-and-control-c2-malware" target="_blank">discovered</a> by security researchers from Uptycs, a cybersecurity company specializing in cloud security. It can also extract the base64-encoded form of the database of Keychain, Apple&#39;s password manager. Users of macOS Catalina (10.5) and versions dependent on Intel, Apple M1, and Apple M2 are affected by this malware.</p>
<p>And while MacStealer appears to be <em>the</em> mac malware to watch, it is pretty rudimentary, according to Thomas Reed, Malwarebytes&#39; director of core technology. &#34;There is no persistence method, and it relies on the user opening the app,&#34; he adds, considering <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.uptycs.com/blog/macstealer-command-and-control-c2-malware" target="_blank">the foreseeable features</a> the developer wants to add to MacStealer in the future.</p>
<p>MacStealer uses channels in Telegram as its command-and-control (C2) center. The malware has been promoted on a dark web forum since the beginning of March. According to the developers, it&#39;s still in the early beta stage, thus lacking a builder and panel. These are also why the developers distribute MacStealer as a malware-as-a-service (MaaS), selling at a low price of $100 and promising more advanced features in the future.</p>
<p>MacStealer arrives to target macOS systems as an unsigned disk image (.DMG) file. Users are manipulated to download and execute this file onto their systems. Once achieved, a bogus password prompts users in an attempt to steal their real password. MacStealer then saves the password in the affected system&#39;s temporary folder (TMP).</p>
<p>The malware then proceeds to collect and save the following also within the TMP folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account passwords, browser cookies, and stored credit card details in Firefox, Chrome, and Brave</li>
<li>Cryptocurrency wallets (Binance, Coinomi, Exodus, Keplr Wallet, Martian Wallet, MetaMask, Phantom, Tron, Trust Wallet)</li>
<li>Keychain database in its encoded (base64)form</li>
<li>Keychain password in text format</li>
<li>Various files (.TXT, .DOC, .DOCX, .PDF, .XLS, .XLSX, .PPT, .PPTX, .JPG, .PNG, .CVS, .BMP, .MP3, .ZIP, .RAR, .PY, .DB)</li>
<li>System information in text form</li>
</ul>
<p>MacStealer also compresses everything it stole in a ZIP file and sends it to remote C&amp;C servers for the threat actor to collect later. At the same time, a summary version of the information it stole is sent to pre-configured Telegram channels, alerting the threat actor that new stolen data is available for download.</p>

<p>MacStealer being an unsigned DMG file is also a barrier for anyone, especially beginners, attempting to run the program on a modern mac, said Malwarebytes&#39; Reed. &#34;Its attempt at phishing for login passwords is not very convincing and would probably only fool a novice user. But such a user is exactly the type who would have trouble opening it.&#34;</p>
