Songtradr told 404 Media that at that point it had already extended offers to all the Bandcamp employees it intended to hire.</p><p>‚ÄúSongtradr had no access to union membership information and we executed our employment offer process with full-consideration of all legal requirements,‚Äù Jalila Singerff, director of communications at Songtradr, told 404 Media in an email. ‚ÄúWe carried out a comprehensive, full company evaluation that involved a detailed examination of each role. This evaluation considered several factors such as product groups, job functions, employee tenure, performance evaluations, the importance of roles for smooth business operations, and whether a similar function already existed at Songtradr including our experience of running it and associated requirements.‚Äù</p><p>After this story was first published, Songtradr told 404 Media in an email that &#34;US employees were extended based on the factors we previously described¬†<strong>before we knew the composition of or met with any bargaining team members.</strong>&#34;</p>
