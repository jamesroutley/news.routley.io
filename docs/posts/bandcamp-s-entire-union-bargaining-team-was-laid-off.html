              <p>Bandcamp’s entire union bargaining team, the eight union members democratically elected by their peers to negotiate their first union contract, were laid off when Epic Games sold Bandcamp to music licensing company Songtradr on Monday. </p><p>Songtradr told 404 Media that it did not have any union membership information when it made its decision on which employees it would keep as part of the sale, but the union told me Songtradr invited them to a meeting with Songtradr’s CEO last week. 404 Media has viewed the invitation, which shows Bandcamp’s bargaining team were invited and that Songtradr’s CEO Paul Wiltshire planned to attend.</p><p>“Songtradr had no access to union membership information and we executed our employment offer process with full-consideration of all legal requirements,” Jalila Singerff, director of communications at Songtradr, told 404 Media in an email. “We carried out a comprehensive, full company evaluation that involved a detailed examination of each role. This evaluation considered several factors such as product groups, job functions, employee tenure, performance evaluations, the importance of roles for smooth business operations, and whether a similar function already existed at Songtradr including our experience of running it and associated requirements.”</p><p>Songtradr didn’t immediately respond to my question about inviting the union bargaining team to a meeting last week. </p><p>Epic Games, a fantastically wealthy company that owns the Unreal Engine, Epic Games Store, and in recent years has seen incredible profits thanks to the huge popularity of <em>Fortnite</em>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/arts/music/epic-games-bandcamp.html?ref=404media.co#:~:text=The%20world%20of%20independent%20music,online%20video%20games%20like%20Fortnite.">acquired Bandcamp</a> in 2022. At the time, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/bandcamp-joining-epic-games-to-support-fair-open-platforms-for-artists-and-fans?ref=404media.co">Epic said</a> that Bandcamp would “play an important role in Epic’s vision to build out a creator marketplace ecosystem for content, technology, games, art, music and more.” The union, Bandcamp United, won recognition in May 2023 through an election administered by the NLRB.</p><p>In September, a little more than a year after Epic acquired Bandcamp, Songtradr <a href="https://www.songtradr.com/blog/posts/songtradr-bandcamp-acquisition?ref=404media.co">announced</a>  that it will acquire Bandcamp as Epic cut around 830 jobs across the company. Epic and Songtradr agreed to an “asset sale” of Bandcamp, meaning Songtradr is only buying parts of Bandcamp as opposed to the entire company. As part of this process, Epic has laid off about half of Bandcamp’s staff, the other half of the staff have accepted job offers to work on Bandcamp at Songtradr.</p><p>“On Monday, October 16, 2023 over half of Bandcamp was laid off as a result of Epic Games’ divestiture to Songtradr,” Bandcamp United said in a statement. “Of those laid off, 40 were in the union bargaining unit out of a total 67 members. None of the eight (8) democratically elected bargaining team members received a job offer.”</p><p>Bandcamp United said that the layoffs cut Bandcamp’s editorial team in half, with 12 out of 13 union-eligible support staff “made redundant.” </p><p>“Not all Bandcamp employees will receive offers from Songtradr,” Songtradr <a href="https://twitter.com/songtradr/status/1709986126117630051?s=20&amp;ref=404media.co">said</a> on October 5. “Bandcamp requires some adjustments to ensure a sustainable and healthy company that can serve its community of artists and fans long into the future.”</p><p>“It feels as though many of the aspects that make Bandcamp human—that make it a balm in an algorithm- and profit-driven music industry—have been gutted through these layoffs,” Atoosa Moinzadeh, a laid off member of Bandcamp’s editorial team, said in a statement.</p>
