    <section>
        <p>PyTorch and TensorFlow are far and away the two most popular Deep Learning frameworks today. The debate over whether PyTorch or TensorFlow is superior is a longstanding point of contentious debate, with each camp having its share of fervent supporters.</p><p>Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have developed so quickly over their relatively short lifetimes that the debate landscape is ever-evolving. Outdated or incomplete information is abundant, and further obfuscates the complex discussion of which framework has the upper hand in a given domain.</p><p>While TensorFlow has a reputation for being an industry-focused framework and PyTorch has a reputation for being a research-focused framework, we’ll see that these notions stem partially from outdated information. The conversation about which framework reigns supreme is much more nuanced going into 2022 - let’s explore these differences now.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>PyTorch and TensorFlow alike have unique development stories and complicated design-decision histories. Previously, this has made comparing the two a complicated technical discussion about their current features and speculated future features. Given that both frameworks have matured exponentially since their inceptions, many of these technical differences are vestigial at this point. </p><p>Luckily for those of us who don’t want their eyes glazing over, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate currently comes down to three practical considerations:</p><ol><li><strong><strong><strong>Model Availability:</strong> </strong></strong>With the domain of Deep Learning expanding every year and models becoming bigger in turn, training State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models from scratch is simply not feasible anymore. There are fortunately many SOTA models publicly available, and it is important to utilize them where possible.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Deployment Infrastructure: </strong></strong></strong>Training well-performing models is pointless if they can’t be put to use. Lowering time-to-deploy is paramount, especially with the growing popularity of microservice business models; and efficient deployment has the potential to make-or-break many businesses that center on Machine Learning.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Ecosystems: </strong></strong></strong>No longer is Deep Learning relegated to specific use cases in highly controlled environments. AI is injecting new power into a litany of industries, so a framework that sits within a larger ecosystem which facilitates development for mobile, local, and server applications is important. Also, the advent of specialized Machine Learning hardware, such as Google’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/edge-tpu">Edge TPU</a>, means that successful practitioners need to work with a framework that can integrate well with this hardware.</li></ol><p>We’ll explore each of these three practical considerations in turn, and then provide our recommendations for which framework to use in different areas.</p><p>Implementing a successful Deep Learning model from scratch can be a very tricky task, especially for applications such as NLP where engineering and optimization are difficult. The growing complexity of SOTA models makes training and tuning simply impractical, approaching impossible, tasks for small-scale enterprises. OpenAI’s GPT-3 has over 175 billion parameters, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cerebras-chip-cluster-neural-networks-ai/">GPT-4</a> will have over <em>100 trillion parameters</em>. Startups and researchers alike simply do not have the computational resources to utilize and explore such models on their own, so access to <strong>pre-trained models</strong> for transfer learning, fine-tuning, or out-of-the-box inference is invaluable. </p><p>In the arena of model availability, PyTorch and TensorFlow diverge sharply. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow have their own official model repositories, as we’ll explore below in the Ecosystems section, but practitioners may want to utilize models from other sources. Let’s take a quantitative look at model availability for each framework.</p><h2 id="huggingface">HuggingFace</h2><p><a href="https://huggingface.co/">HuggingFace</a> makes it possible to incorporate trained and tuned SOTA models into your pipelines in just a few lines of code.</p><p>When we compare HuggingFace model availability for PyTorch vs TensorFlow, the results are staggering. Below we see a chart of the total number of models available on HuggingFace that are either PyTorch or TensorFlow exclusive, or available for both frameworks. As we can see, the number of models available for use exclusively in PyTorch absolutely blows the competition out of the water. Almost 85% of models are PyTorch <strong>exclusive</strong>, and even those that are not exclusive have about a 50% chance of being available in PyTorch as well. In contrast, only about 16% of all models are available for TensorFlow, with only about 8% being TensorFlow-exclusive.</p><figure><img src="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Number-of-Models-on-HuggingFace.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="747" height="498" srcset="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Number-of-Models-on-HuggingFace.png 600w, https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Number-of-Models-on-HuggingFace.png 747w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>We see similar results if we relegate our purview to only the <strong>30</strong> <strong>most popular</strong> <strong>models </strong>on HuggingFace. Not even two thirds of the top 30 models are available in TensorFlow, while <em>all</em> are available in PyTorch. There are <em>zero</em> top-30 models that are TensorFlow exclusive.</p><figure><img src="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Number-of-Top-30-Models-on-HuggingFace.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="747" height="461" srcset="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Number-of-Top-30-Models-on-HuggingFace.png 600w, https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Number-of-Top-30-Models-on-HuggingFace.png 747w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h2 id="research-papers">Research Papers</h2><p>For research practitioners especially, having access to models from recently-published papers is critical. Attempting to recreate new models that you want to explore in a different framework wastes valuable time, so being able to clone a repository and immediately start experimenting means that you can focus on the important work.</p><p>Given that PyTorch is the <em>de facto</em> research framework, we would expect the trend we observed on HuggingFace to continue into the research community as a whole; and our intuition is correct.</p><p>We’ve aggregated data from eight top research journals over the past several years into the below graph, which shows the relative proportion of publications that use PyTorch or TensorFlow. As you can see, the adoption of PyTorch was extremely rapid and, in just a few years, grew from use in just about 7% to use in almost 80% of papers that use either PyTorch or TensorFlow.</p><figure><img src="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Fraction-of-Papers-Using-PyTorch-vs.-TensorFlow.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="747" height="461" srcset="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Fraction-of-Papers-Using-PyTorch-vs.-TensorFlow.png 600w, https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Fraction-of-Papers-Using-PyTorch-vs.-TensorFlow.png 747w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><a href="http://horace.io/pytorch-vs-tensorflow/">Data source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Much of the reason for this rapid adoption was due to difficulties with TensorFlow 1 that were exacerbated in the context of research, leading researchers to look to the newer alternative PyTorch. While many of TensorFlow’s issues were addressed with the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, PyTorch’s momentum has been great enough for it to maintain itself as the established research-centric framework, at least from a community perspective.</p><p>We can see the same pattern if we look at the fraction of researchers who migrated frameworks. When we look at publications by authors that were using either PyTorch or TensorFlow in 2018 and 2019, we find that the <em>majority</em> of authors who used TensorFlow in 2018 migrated to PyTorch in 2019 (55%), while the vast majority of authors who used PyTorch in 2018 stayed with PyTorch 2019 (85%). This data is visualized in the Sankey diagram below, where the left side corresponds to 2018 and the right side to 2019. Note that the data represent proportions of users of each framework in 2018, not total numbers. </p><figure><img src="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Sankey.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="672" srcset="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Sankey.png 600w, https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Sankey.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><a href="https://thegradient.pub/p/cef6dd26-f952-4265-a2bc-f8bfb9eb1efb/">Data source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Careful readers will notice that this data is from <em>before</em> the release of TensorFlow 2, but as we will see in the next section, this fact is irrelevant in the research community.</p><h2 id="papers-with-code">Papers with Code</h2><p>Lastly, we look at data from <a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">Papers with Code</a> - a website whose mission it is to create a free and open resource with Machine Learning papers, code, datasets, etc. We’ve plotted the percentage of papers which utilize PyTorch, TensorFlow, or another framework over time, with data aggregated quarterly, from late 2017 to the current quarter. We see the steady growth of papers utilizing PyTorch - out of the 4,500 repositories created this quarter, <em>60%</em> of them are implemented in PyTorch, with just <em>11% </em>implemented in TensorFlow.</p><figure><img src="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Percentage-of-Repositories-by-Framework-----------------.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="747" height="461" srcset="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Percentage-of-Repositories-by-Framework-----------------.png 600w, https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Percentage-of-Repositories-by-Framework-----------------.png 747w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption><a href="https://paperswithcode.com/trends">Data source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Conversely, we see the steady decline in use of TensorFlow. Even the release of TensorFlow 2 in 2019, which addressed many of the issues that made using TensorFlow 1 painful for research, was not enough to reverse this trend. We see a <strong>near-monotonic decline</strong> in the popularity of TensorFlow, even after the release of TensorFlow 2.</p><h2 id="model-availabilityfinal-words">Model Availability - Final Words</h2><p>It is obvious from the above data that PyTorch currently dominates the research landscape. While TensorFlow 2 made utilizing TensorFlow for research a lot easier, PyTorch has given researchers no reason to go back and give TensorFlow another try. Furthermore, backwards compatibility issues between old research in TensorFlow 1 and new research in TensorFlow 2 only exacerbate this issue. </p><p>For now, PyTorch is the clear winner in the area of research simply for the reason that it has been widely adopted by the community, and most publications/available models use PyTorch.</p><p>There are a couple of notable exceptions / notes:</p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Google AI: </strong></strong></strong>Obviously, research published by Google uses TensorFlow. Given that Google is much more prolific than Facebook (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/21/deepmind-openai-fair-ai-researchers-rank-the-top-ai-labs-worldwide.html">292 vs 92 articles published in NeurIPS or ICML in 2020</a>), some researchers may find it useful to use or at least be proficient in TensorFlow.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>DeepMind: </strong></strong></strong>DeepMind also uses TensorFlow, and is <em>also </em>more prolific than Facebook (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/21/deepmind-openai-fair-ai-researchers-rank-the-top-ai-labs-worldwide.html">110 vs 92 articles published in NeurIPS vs 58 in 2020</a>). DeepMind created <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet">Sonnet</a>, which is a high-level API for TensorFlow that is tailored towards research and sometimes called “the research version of Keras”, which may be useful to those considering using TensorFlow for research. Further, Deepmind’s <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/acme">Acme</a> framework may be essential to Reinforcement Learning practitioners.</li><li><strong><strong><strong>OpenAI: </strong></strong></strong>On the other hand, OpenAI standardized the usage of PyTorch internally in 2020; but, once again for those in Reinforcement Learning, their older <a href="https://github.com/openai/baselines">baselines</a> repository is implemented in TensorFlow. Baselines provides high-quality implementation of Reinforcement Learning algorithms, so TensorFlow may be the best choice for Reinforcement Learning practitioners.</li><li><strong>JAX: </strong>Google has another framework called <a href="https://github.com/google/jax">JAX</a> that is growing in popularity in the research community. There is, in some sense, a lot less overhead in JAX compared to PyTorch or TensorFlow; but it’s underlying philosophy is different than both PyTorch and TensorFlow, and for this reason migrating to JAX may not be a good option for most. There are a growing number of models/papers that utilize JAX, but it is unclear at this time how prevalent it will be in the research community in the coming years relative to PyTorch and TensorFlow.</li></ul><p>TensorFlow has a long and arduous, if not impossible, journey ahead if it wants to reestablish itself as the dominant research framework. </p><p><strong>Round 1</strong> in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to <strong>PyTorch</strong>.</p><p>While employing SOTA models for cutting-edge results is the holy grail of Deep Learning applications from an inference perspective, this ideal is not always practical or even possible to achieve in an industry setting. Access to SOTA models is pointless if there is a laborious, error-prone process of making their intelligence actionable. Therefore, beyond considering which framework affords you access to the shiniest models, it is important to consider the end-to-end Deep Learning process in each framework. </p><p>TensorFlow has been the go-to framework for deployment-oriented applications since its inception, and for good reason. TensorFlow has a litany of associated tools that make the end-to-end Deep Learning process easy and efficient. For deployment specifically, <strong>TensorFlow Serving</strong> and <strong>TensorFlow Lite</strong> allow you to painlessly deploy on clouds, servers, mobile, and IoT devices.</p><p>PyTorch used to be extremely lackluster from a deployment perspective, but it has worked on closing this gap in recent years. The introduction of <strong>TorchServe </strong>last year and <strong>PyTorch Live</strong> just a couple of weeks ago has afforded much-needed native deployment tools, but has PyTorch closed the deployment gap enough to make its use worthwhile in an industry setting? Let’s take a look.</p><h2 id="tensorflow">TensorFlow</h2><p>TensorFlow offers scalable production with static graphs which are optimized for inference performance. When deploying a model with TensorFlow, you use either TensorFlow Serving or TensorFlow Lite depending on the application.</p><h3 id="tensorflow-serving">TensorFlow Serving:</h3><p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving">TensorFlow Serving</a> is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on servers, be them in-house or on the cloud, and is used within the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx">TensorFlow Extended</a> (TFX) end-to-end Machine Learning platform. Serving makes it easy to serialize models into well-defined directories with model tags, and select which model is used to make inference requests while keeping server architecture and APIs static.</p><p>Serving allows you to easily deploy models on specialized gRPC servers, which run Google’s open-source framework for high-performance <a href="https://grpc.io/">RPC</a>. gRPC was designed with the intent on connecting a diverse ecosystem of microserves, so these servers are well suited for model deployment. Serving as a whole is tightly integrated with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud</a> via <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai">Vertex AI</a> and integrates with <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> and <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>.</p><h3 id="tensorflow-lite">TensorFlow Lite:</h3><p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/lite">TensorFlow Lite</a> (TFLite) is for use when deploying TensorFlow models on mobile or IoT/embedded devices. TFLite compresses and optimizes models for these devices, and more widely addresses 5 constraints for on-device Artificial Intelligence - <strong>latency</strong>, <strong>connectivity</strong>, <strong>privacy</strong>,<strong> size</strong>,<strong> </strong>and <strong>power consumption</strong>. The same pipeline is used to simultaneously export both standard Keras-based <code>SavedModels</code> (used with Serving) and TFLite models, so model quality can be compared. </p><p>TFLite can be used for both Android and iOS, as well as microcontrollers (ARM with <a href="https://bazel.build/">Bazel</a> or <a href="https://cmake.org/">CMake</a>) and embedded linux (e.g. a <a href="https://coral.ai/">Coral</a> device). TensorFlows APIs for Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and Swift (archived as of this year), give developers a wide array of language options.</p><h2 id="pytorch">PyTorch</h2><p>PyTorch has invested in making deployment easier, previously being notoriously lackluster in this arena. Previously, PyTorch users would need to use Flask or Django to build a REST API on top of the model, but now they have native deployment options in the form of <strong>TorchServe </strong>and <strong>PyTorch Live</strong>.</p><h3 id="torchserve">TorchServe</h3><p><a href="https://pytorch.org/serve/">TorchServe</a> is an open-source deployment framework resulting from a collaboration between AWS and Facebook (now Meta) and was released in 2020. It has basic features like endpoint specification, model archiving, and observing metrics; but it remains inferior to the TensorFlow alternative. Both REST and gRPC APIs are supported with TorchServe.</p><h3 id="pytorch-live">PyTorch Live</h3><p>PyTorch first released<a href="https://pytorch.org/mobile/home/"> PyTorch Mobile</a> in 2019, which was designed to create an end-to-end workflow for the deployment of optimized machine learning models for Android, iOS, and Linux.</p><p><a href="https://pytorch.org/live/">PyTorch Live</a> was released at the beginning of December to build upon Mobile. It uses JavaScript and React Native to create cross-platform iOS and Android AI-powered apps with associated UIs. The on-device inference is still performed by PyTorch Mobile. Live comes with example projects to bootstrap from, and has plans to support audio and video input in the future</p><h2 id="deploymentfinal-words">Deployment - Final Words</h2><p>Currently, TensorFlow still wins on the deployment front. Serving and TFLite are simply more robust than the PyTorch competitors, and the ability to use TFLite for local AI in conjunction with Google’s Coral devices is a must-have for many industries. In contrast, PyTorch Live focuses on mobile only, and TorchServe is still in its infancy. It will be interesting to see how the deployment arena changes in the coming years, but for now <strong>Round 2</strong> in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to <strong>TensorFlow</strong>.</p><p><em>A final note on the issues of model availability and deployment: For those who want to use the TensorFlow deployment infrastructure but want access to models that are only available in PyTorch, consider using <a href="https://onnx.ai/">ONNX</a> to port the models from PyTorch to TensorFlow</em></p><p>The final important consideration that separates PyTorch and TensorFlow in 2022 is the ecosystems in which they are situated. Both PyTorch and TensorFlow are capable frameworks from a modeling perspective, and their technical differences at this point are less important than the ecosystems surrounding them, which provide tools for easy deployment, management, distributed training, etc. Let’s take a look at each framework’s ecosystem now.</p><h2 id="pytorch-1">PyTorch</h2><h3 id="hub">Hub</h3><p>Beyond platforms like HuggingFace, there is also the official <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/hub.html">PyTorch Hub</a> - a research-oriented platform for sharing repositories with pre-trained models. Hub has a wide range of models, including those for Audio, Vision, and NLP. It also has generative models, including a <a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/facebookresearch_pytorch-gan-zoo_pgan/">GAN</a> for generating high-quality images of celebrity faces.</p><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Q_STziz6TIpPtb2lxgLA3G7v9ugxDcX_5D5ZnLBl0ZroHrzfBKy-FXP4KNnUsYrGJn4M8fg32JQWgsX-opK5rNqX0dOxrLffKYib7wKnCAP7wiV2PoCQSH1G9362BHXfkwEMlyjN" alt="" loading="lazy"/><figcaption><a href="https://pytorch.org/hub/facebookresearch_pytorch-gan-zoo_pgan/">Image source</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="speechbrain">SpeechBrain</h3><p><a href="https://speechbrain.github.io/">SpeechBrain</a> is PyTorch’s official open-source speech toolkit.

It is a tool for distributed training which manages worker processes and coordinates restart behaviors so that you can train models on a cluster of compute nodes which can change dynamically without affecting training. Therefore, TorchElastic prevents catastrophic failures from issues such as server maintenance events or network issues so you do not lose training progress. TorchElastic features integration with Kubernetes and has been incorporated into PyTorch 1.9+.</p><h3 id="torchx">TorchX</h3><p><a href="https://pytorch.org/torchx/latest/">TorchX</a> is an SDK for the quick building and deployment of Machine Learning applications. TorchX includes the Training Session Manager API to launch distributed PyTorch applications onto supported schedulers. It is responsible for launching the distributed job while natively supporting jobs that are <em>locally</em> managed by TorchElastic.</p><h3 id="lightning">Lightning</h3><p><a href="https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/">PyTorch Lightning</a> is sometimes called the Keras of PyTorch. While this comparison is slightly misleading, Lightning is a useful tool for simplifying the model engineering and training processes in PyTorch, and it has matured significantly since its initial release in 2019. Lightning approaches the modeling process in an object-oriented way, defining reusable and shareable components that can be utilized across projects.

It is useful if you want to go under-the-hood to understand how models work, or modify them for your own needs - something that is not possible with serialized pre-trained models beyond transfer learning and fine tuning. </p><p>Model Garden contains directories for official models maintained by Google, research models maintained by researchers, and curated community models maintained by the community. TensorFlow’s long term goal is to provide pre-trained versions of models from Model Garden on Hub, and for pretrained models on Hub to have available source code in Model Garden.</p><h3 id="extended-tfx">Extended (TFX)</h3><p><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx">TensorFlow Extended</a> is TensorFlow&#39;s end-to-end platform for model deployment.

PyTorch users can of course take advantage of these datasets as well.</p><h2 id="ecosystemsfinal-words">Ecosystems - Final Words</h2><p>This round is the closest of the three, but ultimately TensorFlow has the superior ecosystem. Google has invested heavily in ensuring that there is a well-developed product in each relevant area of a Deep Learning system. The close integration with Google Cloud along with TFX make the end-to-end development process a breeze, and the ease of porting models to Google Coral devices hands a landslide victory to TensorFlow for some industries.</p><p><strong>Round 3</strong> in the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate goes to <strong>TensorFlow</strong>.</p><p>As you probably expect, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate does not have a single correct answer - it is only sensible to say that one framework is superior to another with respect to a specific use-case. To help you decide which framework is best for you, we’ve compiled our recommendations into flow charts below, with each chart tailored to a different area of interest.</p><h2 id="what-if-i%E2%80%99m-in-industry">What if I’m in Industry?</h2><figure><img src="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Industry_cropped.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="615" srcset="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Industry_cropped.png 600w, https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Industry_cropped.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>If you perform Deep Learning engineering in an industry setting, you’re likely using TensorFlow and should probably stick with it. TensorFlow’s robust deployment framework and end-to-end TensorFlow Extended platform are invaluable for those who need to productionize models. Easy deployment on a gRPC server along with model monitoring and artifact tracking are critical tools for industry use. With the recent release of TorchServe, you can consider using PyTorch if you have a good reason to, such as a need to access SOTA models only available in PyTorch. In this case, consider using ONNX to deploy a converted PyTorch model within TensorFlow’s deployment workflows.</p><p>If you’re building mobile applications, you can consider using PyTorch given the recent release of PyTorch Live, unless you require audio or video input, in which case you should be using TensorFlow. If you’re building embedded systems or IoT devices that utilize AI, you should still be using TensorFlow given that the TFLite + Coral ecosystem.</p><p>Bottom line: if you have to choose one framework, choose <strong>TensorFlow</strong>.</p><h2 id="what-if-i%E2%80%99m-a-researcher">What if I’m a Researcher?</h2><figure><img src="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Research.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="672" srcset="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Research.png 600w, https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Research.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>If you’re a researcher, you’re almost certainly using PyTorch, and for now you should likely stick with it. PyTorch is the <em>de facto </em>research framework, so most SOTA models are in/for PyTorch. </p><p>There are a couple of notable exceptions to this rule, the most notable being that those in Reinforcement Learning should consider using TensorFlow. TensorFlow has a native <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/overview">Agents</a> library for Reinforcement Learning, and Deepmind’s <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/acme">Acme</a> framework is implemented in TensorFlow. OpenAI’s <a href="https://github.com/openai/baselines">Baselines</a> model repository is also implemented in TensorFlow, although OpenAI’s <a href="https://gym.openai.com/">Gym</a> can be used with either TensorFlow or PyTorch. If you plan to use TensorFlow for your research, you should also check out Deepmind’s <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet">Sonnet</a> for higher-level abstractions.</p><p>If you do not want to use TensorFlow, you should consider exploring Google’s JAX if you are doing TPU training. It is not a neural network framework itself, but closer to an implementation of NumPy for G/TPUs with autodifferentiation capabilities. Deepmind’s <a href="https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku">Haiku</a>, which they call “Sonnet for JAX”, is a neural network library built on top of JAX that is worth exploring if you are considering JAX. If you’re not doing TPU training, it is probably best to stick with PyTorch for now. </p><p>Whichever framework you choose, you should keep your eye on JAX in 2022, especially as its community grows and more publications begin utilizing it.</p><p>Bottom line: if you need to choose one framework, choose <strong>PyTorch</strong></p><h2 id="what-if-i%E2%80%99m-a-professor">What if I’m a Professor?</h2><figure><img src="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Professor.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="672" srcset="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Professor.png 600w, https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Professor.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>If you’re a professor, which framework to use for a Deep Learning course depends on the goals of the course. If the focus of your course is to produce industry-ready Deep Learning engineers who can hit the ground running with competency in the entire end-to-end Deep Learning process, not just Deep Learning theory, then you should use TensorFlow. In this case, exposure to the TensorFlow ecosystem and its tools along with end-to-end practice projects will be very instructive and valuable.</p><p>If the focus of your course is on Deep Learning theory and understanding the under-the-hood of Deep Learning models, then you should use PyTorch. This is especially true if you are teaching a high-level undergraduate course or an early graduate-level course which intends to prepare students to perform Deep Learning research.</p><p>Ideally, students should get exposure to each framework, and dedicating some time to understanding the differences between the frameworks is probably valuable despite the time constraints of a single semester. If the course is part of a larger program in Machine Learning with many classes dedicated to different topics, it may be better to stick with the framework best suited for the course material rather than try to give exposure to both.</p><h2 id="what-if-i%E2%80%99m-looking-for-a-career-change">What if I’m Looking for a Career Change?</h2><figure><img src="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Career-Change-v2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="672" srcset="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Career-Change-v2.png 600w, https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Career-Change-v2.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>If you’re looking to make a career change, either PyTorch or TensorFlow is a good option. The most important thing you can do in this case is to demonstrate that you can bring value out-of-the-gate, so having a portfolio of projects is crucial. Going beyond the run-of-the-mill by applying Deep Learning to creative use cases, or showing that you’re industry-ready by taking a project end-to-end, will position you very well. </p><p>Therefore, use whichever framework you can work more easily in. Using the framework that is more intuitive to you will allow you to efficiently build your portfolio, which is vastly more important than being familiar with the API of a specific framework. That having been said, if you are completely framework-agnostic, use TensorFlow given that it is the preferred industry framework. We’ve compiled the number of job postings from various career websites for each framework in the graph below, and TensorFlow beats out PyTorch substantially.</p><figure><img src="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Number-of-Job-Postings-by-Framework-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="747" height="461" srcset="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Number-of-Job-Postings-by-Framework-1.png 600w, https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Number-of-Job-Postings-by-Framework-1.png 747w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>LinkedIn and ZipRecruiter data correspond to all jobs posted in the U.S. while Indeed data corresponds to jobs posted within 100 miles of 11 major cities in the U.S. </figcaption></figure><p>Bottom Line: If you have a specific reason to use PyTorch, such as having the goal of working for OpenAI or TensorFlow being hopelessly unintuitive to you, then feel free to use it; but our recommendation is to focus on <strong>TensorFlow</strong>.</p><h2 id="what-if-i%E2%80%99m-a-hobbyist">What if I’m a Hobbyist?</h2><figure><img src="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Hobbyist_cropped.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="960" height="499" srcset="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/Hobbyist_cropped.png 600w, https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/Hobbyist_cropped.png 960w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>If you’re a hobbyist who’s interested in Deep Learning, which framework you use will depend on your goals. If you’re implementing a Deep Learning model as part of some larger project, then TensorFlow is likely what you want to use, especially if you are deploying to an IoT/embedded device. While you could use PyTorch for mobile applications given the release of PyTorch Live, TensorFlow + TFLite is still the preferred methodology for now. </p><p>If your goal is to learn about Deep Learning for its own sake, then which framework is best in this case depends on your background. In general, PyTorch is probably the better option here, especially if you’re used to working in Python.

Using its high-level components, you can easily get started understanding the basics of Deep Learning. Once you are prepared to start understanding more thoroughly the nuts-and-bolts of Deep Learning, you have a couple of options:</p><p>If you do not want to install a new framework and are worried about how well your competency will translate to a new API, then you can try “dropping down” from Keras to TensorFlow. Depending on your background, TensorFlow may be confusing, in which case try moving to PyTorch.</p><p>If you want a framework that more natively feels like Python, then moving to PyTorch may be your best move. In this case, be aware that you’ll have to install a new framework and potentially rewrite custom scripts. Further, if PyTorch seems a bit cumbersome to you, you can compartmentalize your code and get rid of some boilerplate by using <a href="https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/pytorch-lightning-for-dummies/">PyTorch Lightning</a>.</p><p>If you’re a complete beginner, consider watching some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AssemblyAI/featured">YouTube tutorials</a> in both TensorFlow and PyTorch to decide which framework feels more intuitive to you.</p><p>As you can see, the PyTorch vs TensorFlow debate is a nuanced one whose landscape is constantly changing, and out-of-date information makes understanding this landscape even more difficult. In 2022, both PyTorch and TensorFlow are very mature frameworks, and their core Deep Learning features overlap significantly. Today, the practical considerations of each framework, like their model availability, time to deploy, and associated ecosystems, supersede their technical differences.</p><p>You’re not making a mistake in choosing either framework, for both have good documentation, many learning resources, and active communities.  While PyTorch has become the <em>de facto </em>research framework after its explosive adoption by the research community and TensorFlow remains the legacy industry framework, there are certainly use cases for each in both domains. </p><p>Hopefully our recommendations have helped you navigate the complicated PyTorch vs TensorFlow landscape!
