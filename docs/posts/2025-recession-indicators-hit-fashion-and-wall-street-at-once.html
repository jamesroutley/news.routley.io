Others resemble one-off relics that were hugely popular during (or just before) the last significant U.S. economic downturn (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/past-recessions.asp" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/past-recessions.asp" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">the Great Recession</a>, which spanned from roughly December 2007 to June 2009). I&#39;ve seen the return of Chloé&#39;s Paddington bag, Alexander McQueen&#39;s skull print, and Prada&#39;s built-in necklace necklines labeled as &#34;recession indicators&#34; online by editors in my professional circles. The same goes for Dior&#39;s J&#39;Adore Dior logo T-shirts and the bootcut denim comeback.

A gauzy skull scarf print or a pre-embellished beaded neckline could transport any fashion enthusiast straight back to 2008—hence the wink-wink, nudge-nudge nickname online. But these items aren&#39;t as much of a true recession indicator as the broader trends that evolve from collection to collection and brand to brand. (Plus, what creative director would intentionally delve into their archive with the goal of evoking memories of a year without much shopping?)</p><p>The <em>real </em>recession indicators in fashion are reflected in trending searches for simple suiting, neutral colors, and conservatively long hemlines—categories that last peaked in the mid-2000s and tend to represent a world-weary, budget-conscious consumer. Madé Lapuerta, who analyzes search behavior on the account <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/databutmakeitfashion/p/DHbO0OWuJoh/?hl=en&amp;img_index=3" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/databutmakeitfashion/p/DHbO0OWuJoh/?hl=en&amp;img_index=3" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">@databutmakeitfashion</a>, notes that interest in maxi skirts rose by 393 percent in March; &#34;minimalist&#34; and &#34;corporate&#34; styles increased by 39 and 38 percent, respectively.</p><p>These items initially reflect a more somber mood—the aesthetic opposite of the one percent&#39;s loud luxury and sequin-bedecked party wear. (If you can&#39;t buy eggs, you certainly aren&#39;t buying logo-coated bags and megawatt watches.) Minimalist styles are also inherently practical and can justify their cost-per-wear in a matter of weeks. If spare change for shopping dries up, they&#39;ll still look stylish.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dsQkAJ5a6XqYhyhbSKekA4-320-80.webp" alt="a woman at Milan Fashion Week wearing gray suiting" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dsQkAJ5a6XqYhyhbSKekA4-1920-80.webp 1920w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dsQkAJ5a6XqYhyhbSKekA4-1600-80.webp 1600w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dsQkAJ5a6XqYhyhbSKekA4-1280-80.webp 1280w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dsQkAJ5a6XqYhyhbSKekA4-1024-80.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dsQkAJ5a6XqYhyhbSKekA4-768-80.webp 768w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dsQkAJ5a6XqYhyhbSKekA4-415-80.webp 415w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dsQkAJ5a6XqYhyhbSKekA4-360-80.webp 360w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dsQkAJ5a6XqYhyhbSKekA4-320-80.webp 320w" sizes="(min-width: 710px) 670px, calc(100vw - 30px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dsQkAJ5a6XqYhyhbSKekA4.webp" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dsQkAJ5a6XqYhyhbSKekA4.webp"/></p></div><figcaption><p>Corporate coded clothing during fashion month street style shows even fashion people are trying to stretch their clothes&#39; lifespans. </p></figcaption><p>(Image credit: Launchmetrics Spotlight)</p></figure><p>Muted colors, covered silhouettes, and pared-back details were equally prevalent in the lead-up to the Great Recession, according to FIT Fashion Business Management Professor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.vincentgquan.com/about" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.vincentgquan.com/about" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Vincent Quan</a>. &#34;With discretionary spending limited, consumers &#39;traded down&#39; by purchasing value-priced items, including apparel and accessories, which offered a haven from fashion trends,&#34; he explains. &#34;The focus on minimalism contrasted sharply with the maximalist aesthetic that prevailed during the economic boom period prior to 2007.&#34;</p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-EHuHLrNNJRJkQjKpn3fJY4"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Get exclusive access to fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.</p></section></div></div></div><p>360-degree basics—in shape, color, and cut—naturally have increased utility.

The business expert also noticed that skirts are getting longer on the Fall 2025 runways, interpreting it as a sign of &#34;volatility.&#34; Designers don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen to the global economy—but they seem just as on-edge as their shoppers, and are creating accordingly.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-1920-80.jpg.webp 1920w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-1600-80.jpg.webp 1600w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-1280-80.jpg.webp 1280w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-768-80.jpg.webp 768w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-415-80.jpg.webp 415w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-360-80.jpg.webp 360w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-320-80.jpg.webp 320w" sizes="(min-width: 710px) 670px, calc(100vw - 30px)"/><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-320-80.jpg" alt="three models wearing knee length skirts indicative of the hemline index" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-1920-80.jpg 1920w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-1600-80.jpg 1600w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-1280-80.jpg 1280w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-768-80.jpg 768w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-415-80.jpg 415w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-360-80.jpg 360w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB-320-80.jpg 320w" sizes="(min-width: 710px) 670px, calc(100vw - 30px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUsWadQzz3ku59FPU2v5aB.jpg"/></picture></p></div><figcaption><p>Midi and maxi skirts returned to popularity during fashion month—another sign of a downward-trending market. </p></figcaption><p>(Image credit: Getty Images)</p></figure><p>Before 2025 kicked off with tariff panic and empty egg shelves, Pantone selected<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/mocha-mousse-color-trend/" target="_blank" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/mocha-mousse-color-trend/"> &#34;Mocha Mousse&#34; as the color of the year</a>.
