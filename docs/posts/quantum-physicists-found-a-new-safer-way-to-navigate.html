    <h1>Quantum Physicists Found a New, Safer Way to Navigate</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>For navigation, DiMario uses the diamond to detect distinctive ripples and bumps in Earth’s magnetic field known as magnetic anomalies, which the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association has previously mapped. Once he identifies an anomaly, he can use it as a reference point to navigate. Currently, ships and planes do not use magnetic anomalies for navigation because most magnetic sensors can only measure the field strength and not the direction the field is pointing, says DiMario. But his team’s device can measure both. Because it doesn’t need to communicate with a satellite to function, this quantum sensor is less vulnerable to hacking.</p><p>So far, DiMario and his team have tested the sensor&#39;s navigation capability in a flight, an SUV in New Jersey, and a ship in the Chesapeake Bay. Eventually, DiMario wants to shrink the cylinder to the size of a hockey puck, where it could be used in any type of transportation as an independent check on GPS.</p><p>DiMario and his team aren’t the only ones betting on quantum navigation. At a National Institute of Standards and Technology lab in Colorado, physicist Azure Hansen is working on a quantum gyroscope for sensing rotational motion. Pilots, for example, currently use a type of gyroscope to keep their planes level, and self-driving cars use them to navigate. But current gyroscopes drift, much like how a fast clock gets more wrong as time goes by. The drift is substantial enough that pilots have to reset gyroscopes, a largely automated process, every hour or so. The auto-reset works well—except if it breaks. Quantum gyroscopes could be more reliable because they don’t drift at all, says Hansen: their fundamental components are atoms and won’t warp with time.</p><p>Hansen’s device fits on a tabletop, about the size of two stacked minifridges. Inside is a glass chamber, smaller than a sugar cube, that contains eight million rubidium atoms. A laser steers the atoms, which behave more like waves colliding in a pond than discrete particles. The collisions produce a ripple pattern that, when imaged, looks like a bunch of stripes. If the chamber rotates, the stripes will rotate too. The number of stripes tells you the degree of rotation; and variations in the pattern will even reveal the strength of Earth’s gravitational field. Taken together, this rotational information and the measurement of Earth’s field can also act as a navigation tool, says Hansen. Like the diamond magnetometer, it can also be used as backup for GPS.</p><figure><p><span><p>NIST&#39;s gyroscope measures rotation by prodding rubidium atoms with lasers to produce a distinctive stripe pattern on a detector.</p>
