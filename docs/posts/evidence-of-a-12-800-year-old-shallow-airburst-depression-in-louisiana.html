Analytical techniques employed on these materials include optical microscopy, the universal stage, electron microscopy (SEM, TEM, and STEM), cathodoluminescence, laser ablation (LA-ICP-MS), neutron activation (INAA), and radiometric dating. These analyses reveal that the deposits exhibit morphological and compositional similarities to known impact-related proxies. Radiocarbon dating and 40Ar/39Ar analyses constrain the likely age of deposition to between 30,000 and 10,000 calibrated years BP, with a concentration of dates clustering around 12,800 years BP (12,835-12,735 cal BP), coinciding with the age range of the Younger Dryas Boundary (YDB). Spherule and meltglass abundances, along with evidence of high-temperature mineral transformations, are consistent with the effects of a high-energy airburst or impact. Hydrocode modeling suggests that a touch-down airburst could plausibly account for the observed shallow depression, material dispersal patterns, and geochemical signatures. Our study suggests that a 300-m-long lake/depression at the Perkins site represents North America’s first identified YDB-age airburst crater.</p></section><section xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" id="main-article-text"><div itemprop="articleBody" dir="auto"><div><a id="s1"><!--

In contrast, low-altitude “touch-down” airbursts may induce surface melting, spherule formation, shocked quartz, and shallow cratering [<a href="#r2">2</a>]. Due to preservation challenges, few airburst signatures are documented in the geologic record, limiting our understanding of these events.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e501">Here, we report findings from a site approximately 5.8 km east of Perkins, Louisiana (30.3980° N, 93.3535° W) (<a href="#fg001">Figure 1</a>), where an anomalous 300-m-long seasonal lake/depression (<a href="#fg002">Figure 2</a>) is associated with extensive deposits of likely impact-related materials (<a href="#fg003">Figure 3</a>). We tested the hypothesis that an airburst/impact at the Perkins site produced these materials. To understand these deposits, we conducted a multi-disciplinary study employing a comprehensive suite of microscopy and geochemical techniques to characterize the material, investigate its origin, and determine whether the Perkins site represents an airburst/impact cratering event.</p><div id="fg001"><a id="fg001"><!--

Later, in 2006, lead author R.F. began to test his father’s suggestion of a crater and discovered several locations around the lake displaying large semi-consolidated masses of spherules associated with multi-cm-sized fragments of black vesicular glass, which, he reasoned, might result from a cosmic airburst/impact event. Beginning in 2006, lead author R.F. found very large quantities of meltglass and spherules in two deposits near the raised rim of the lake, ~300 m long and 120 m wide.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e562">From 2006 through 2024, lead author R.F. also hand-extracted 32 cores (~4 to 13 cm in diameter) and excavated two trenches (~3 m wide). Locations and results are described in the sections below. In 2007, after identifying numerous spherules and fragments of meltglass in the Vee and Pond deposits, R.F. first contacted one of the co-authors (K.E.), who analyzed the spherules and meltglass. His analyses suggested that they resulted from a cosmic impact event, and he recommended additional research. In 2011, R.F. next contacted members of the Comet Research Group, who analyzed these materials to investigate their characteristics and origin.</p></div><div><a id="s3"><!--

High-altitude airbursts, like the 1908 Tunguska event (~5-10 km altitude) [<a href="#r1">1</a>], primarily cause widespread devastation through blast waves but typically leave no craters [<a href="#r2">2</a>]. Even so, the airburst evidence at Tunguska has been reported to include spherules, shocked quartz, glass-filled fractured quartz, melted feldspar, carbon spherules, and glasslike carbon [<a href="#r1">1</a>]. Such events, called “touch-down airbursts,” occur when a bolide explodes sufficiently close to Earth’s surface that high-velocity fragments, the shockwave, and the thermal pulse form meltglass, create spherules, generate shocked quartz, and potentially create shallow ephemeral craters [<a href="#r2">2</a>].</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e581">Due to the scarcity of documented cases of airbursts and the frequent lack of evidence preserved in the geologic record, the effects of airbursts are still poorly understood. However, understanding them is vitally important because, as Boslough and Crawford [<a href="#r3">3</a>, <a href="#r4">4</a>] wrote, “<i>Low-altitude airbursts are by far the most frequent impact events that have an effect on the ground.</i>” To provide additional insights into airburst processes in the geologic record, we document our discoveries at this new proposed airburst location near Perkins, SW Louisiana (<a href="#fg001">Figure 1</a>).</p></div><div><a id="s4"><!--

The medium gray bar represents a 95% CI, while the dark gray is a 68% CI.

Although this makes assessing synchroneity problematic, given that the key interval at Trench #1 dates to 12,794 ± 69 cal BP, we suggest that the melted material at Perkins resulted from a single cosmic impact event at the YD onset ~12,800 years ago. Thus, the high quality of radiocarbon age for the spherule-and-meltglass layer in Trench #1 takes precedence over the less accurate meltglass ages when inferring an age for the layer.</p></div><div><a id="s8b"><!--

Optical microscopy, SEM, and CL reveal evidence of extensive fractures and lamellae (12 in ~25,000 grains).

Both forms of melted silica within quartz grains are called “glass” in this contribution. The presence of melted silica within shocked quartz is a characteristic that makes glass-filled shocked quartz a reliable indicator of cosmic impact events [<a href="#r9">9</a>]. Indeed, French and Koeberl [<a href="#r38">38</a>] emphasized the primary importance of melted silica in PDFs.

This phenomenon is typically observed in high-stress environments, such as fault zones at a macro-scale, volcanic eruptions at a macro-scale, and impact craters at micro- and macro-scales.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e1973">During an impact event, the cement in quartz grains commonly comprises isotropic, amorphous, and often vesicular silica. Sometimes, the entire quartz grain is melted, and as the molten quartz cools, it re-crystallizes into aggregates, with each globule representing a different crystallite [<a href="#r45">45</a>, <a href="#r46">46</a>]. In some cases, the aggregates crystallize into spherical shapes; however, in other cases, they become sub-spherical, such as those observed in the Vee deposit (<a href="#fg028">Figure 28</a>). If the molten cement is quartz in a quartz grain, the grain is referred to as monomict quartz microbreccia; if the material is composed of other elements, the grain is referred to as polymict quartz microbreccia. Shocked quartz has previously been observed in monomict quartz breccia associated with Libyan Desert Glass [<a href="#r47">47</a>] and in the YDB-aged site, Abu Hureyra, Syria [<a href="#r26">26</a>].</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e1990">

We tested this hypothesis by conducting two magnetic surveys on the lake/depression across two wing-like features, similar to the pattern produced by the Tunguska airburst [<a href="#r48">48</a>, <a href="#r49">49</a>], the Saarland structure airburst [<a href="#r50">50</a>], and rays of secondary ejecta on the Moon and Mars [<a href="#r51">51</a>].

These magnetic signatures may result from several impact-related processes: (i) The concentration of magnetic minerals through ballistic sorting during ejection and deposition; (ii) the thermal alteration of iron-bearing minerals during the impact event, potentially producing new magnetic phases through heating and rapid cooling; and (iii) possible contributions from impactor material, as suggested by the elevated Ni/Fe and Cr/Fe ratios that we found in the spherules and meltglass.</p><div id="fg029"><a id="fg029"><!--

Age of the Perkins materials</h4><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2130">The Bayesian-modeled age of the <i>in situ</i> spherule-and-meltglass deposit in Trench #1 is well constrained at 12,794 ± 69 cal BP, and the ages of some meltglass in Vee and Pond deposits overlap at 95% CI. We acquired six radiocarbon dates on carbon-rich material from the Vee and Pond deposits, but the dates did not definitively constrain the age of the deposits. Large carbon spherules from the Vee meltglass date to &gt;28,000 cal BP, and six radiocarbon dates on large peat-like carbon-rich material extracted from the Vee and Pond deposits were all older than 42,000 cal BP. The reason for the old ages is unclear, but we speculate that when the Vee and Pond deposits were excavated by backhoe, older and younger carbon was mixed into the deposits, giving a wide range of dates.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2135">The <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar dating helped eliminate any association with older craters elsewhere and confirmed a young deposit age. The significant uncertainties are mainly due to the presence of only small amounts of radiogenic argon (&lt;5%) and the relatively long (6-hour) neutron irradiation that was conducted to test for ages in the Ma range. Incomplete resetting during impact-related thermal degassing could have led to an overestimate of the age, especially for very young (&lt;100 ka) ages. Temperatures &gt;1000°C were most likely attained during the impact, but these conditions only persisted for a few seconds, perhaps leading to incomplete argon diffusion. Non-radiogenic argon from air or other sources could also have been incorporated into the spherules as fluid inclusions or trapped on the surface of the spherules, leading to low radiogenic argon fractions (&lt;5%). Shorter irradiation durations and additional chemical treatment planned for further work could provide better constraints on the formation age of these spherules.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2143">The Vee and Pond glass median ages are slightly younger than for Trench #1, possibly due to contamination by microscopic modern plant roots that penetrated the glass and were impossible to remove during processing for radiocarbon dating. An alternate hypothesis is that three meltglass-forming impact events occurred one or more centuries apart, separated by only a few 100 m. However, this hypothesis is statistically unlikely. Alternatively, several lines of evidence suggest that the deposits in Trench #1, the Vee, and the Pond are the same age. First, the layer of spherules, meltglass, and shocked quartz in Trench #1 is stratigraphically below an Early Archaic projectile point (age range: ~10,000-8,000 cal BP), thus indicating deposition of the material occurred before that (<a href="#fg004">Figure 4</a>, <b>

</b> [<a href="#r5">5</a>]). Second, in Trench #1, spherules, meltglass, and shocked quartz grains were associated with sedimentary carbon with a modeled age of 12,794 ± 69 cal BP, consistent with the age range of the YDB impact event from 12,835-12,735 cal BP (<a href="#fg004">Figure 4</a>, <b>
<a href="#s25">Supporting Information, Tables S1</a> and <a href="#s25">S2</a>
</b> [<a href="#r5">5</a>]). Third, five radiocarbon dates on the carbon-rich meltglass from the Vee and Pond deposits range from ~10,000 to 20,000 cal BP, and one sample of carbon spherules dated to ~29,000 cal BP (<a href="#fg005">Figure 5</a>, <b>
<a href="#s25">Supporting Information, Tables S1</a> and <a href="#s25">S3</a>
</b> [<a href="#r5">5</a>]), suggesting that this material was deposited between ~30,000 and 10,000 cal BP. Two of the five ages also overlap with the age of the deposits in Trench #1 and the age range of the YDB impact event at 99% CI. This result suggests that the impact occurred at ~12,800 cal BP, but more research is needed to confirm the inferred age of the event.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2191">Although the dating on the deposits is uncertain, the spherules, meltglass, and shocked quartz grains in the well-dated Trench #1 are morphologically and geochemically similar to those in the Vee and Pond deposits, suggesting that all were deposited at the same time.</p></div><div><a id="s18"><!--

However, none of these historical industries could have produced glass slag.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2205">Lastly, we considered that the material might be fly ash from coal-fired power plants or railroad slag. The current landowners maintain that the previous owners dug up the deposits and did not haul in fly ash or other industrial material. Even so, we explored this contamination as a possibility. To do so, we compared the elemental abundances of Perkins spherules and meltglass to 273 fly ash samples from 31 studies representing 38 sites in Australia/New Zealand, Asia, Europe, Africa/Mideast, and North America (<a href="#fg031">Figiure 31A</a>, <b>

Furthermore, the meltglass and spherules are buried up to ~6.5 m below the surface, making anthropogenic contamination highly unlikely. Furthermore, anthropogenesis from industrial activities is doubtful because all seven radiocarbon dates are older than 10,000 years, ranging from ~10,000 to 30,000 cal BP. In addition, the deposits are geochemically nearly identical to the average of Perkins sediment samples, suggesting the deposits derive from local sediment. Although anthropogenic sources (e.g., power plants, factories, and railroads) are capable of producing spherules and meltglass, they cannot generate temperatures required to melt or boil quartz, zircon, and kaolinite (~1710° to 4400°C), nor are they capable of generating the pressures needed to produce shocked quartz.</p></div><div><a id="s18b"><!--

Their analyses confirmed that these features were melted silica rather than cryptocrystalline or microcrystalline quartz. As was previously reported for Tunguska, we often measured oxygen/silicon ratios of 53/47 wt% or less in partially melted grains, significantly lower than quartz overgrowth and quartz cement (i.e., hydrated silica at ~66/34 wt%), thus eliminating authigenesis.

One might reasonably expect lightning strikes to be frequent over time on any given part of the planet, and therefore, fulgurites should be ubiquitous. However, we found only one fulgurite in 32 cores and five trenches, and it was not associated with an abundance peak in spherules and meltglass. Furthermore, meltglass was not ubiquitous outside of the inferred impact layer. Although we searched extensively for meltglass fragments in Trench #1, we observed none in three samples, inconsistent with formation by lightning strikes, which are expected to be ubiquitous.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2349">There is a potential connection between lightning and impacts. Lightning strikes are inferred to be numerous in impact-related dust clouds, based on observing massive increases in lightning in volcanic plumes. For example, after the submarine eruption of Hunga Tonga, the incidence of volcanic lightning was so high that it constituted up to 80% of all global lightning activity at that time [<a href="#r60">60</a>]. However, lightning generated during an airburst differs significantly from typical thunderstorm or volcanic lightning in several key aspects. In airburst-generated lightning, charge separation primarily occurs through debris particles rather than water droplets or ice crystals in thunderstorms [<a href="#r61">61</a>]. The dust/debris cloud produced by the airburst would have distinct electrical conductivity properties due to its unique composition, which includes vaporized impactor material and superheated atmospheric gases [<a href="#r62">62</a>], combined with extreme temperatures exceeding several thousand Kelvin.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2360">While lightning related to an impact event may have contributed to forming some features in our samples, the mechanism would have differed fundamentally from typical terrestrial lightning processes, potentially producing unique signatures in the geological record.

There are five known impact craters in the southeastern United States within 800 km of Perkins: a ~58-Ma crater 300 km away in Texas, a ~84-Ma crater ~700 km away in Alabama, and three ~100-300-Ma craters &gt;800 km away in Tennessee. In addition, Chicxulub, the 65-Ma K-Pg crater, is &gt;1000 kilometers away in Yucatán, Mexico, and the 35-Ma Chesapeake Bay crater is &gt;1700 km away in Virginia. These craters are too distant to have ejected a 16.33 kg meltglass fragment that landed at the Perkins site. In addition, it is unlikely that spherule deposits hundreds of km away from a crater would have been concentrated at &gt;100 billion spherules/kg at Perkins. Additionally, the <sup>40</sup>Ar/<sup>39</sup>Ar data of the spherules constrain the age to &lt;2 Ma, significantly younger than any known major impacts in the region. Thus, the most plausible scenario is that a local impact event deposited the material, most likely within the last 30,000-10,000 years.</p></div><div><a id="s18i"><!--

We searched but found no other primary deposits away from the lake/depression. Therefore, the most likely source appears to be the Lake deposit site on the NW edge of the lake/depression (<a href="#fg003">Figure 3</a>). The glass-and-spherule deposits’ lateral and vertical distribution patterns are consistent with the lake being ground zero for an airburst/impact, but this issue of their origin remains unclear.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2395">To further explore the cosmic impact hypothesis, we performed neutron activation analyses (NAA) on the sediment from Trench #1 in search of elemental abundances indicative of potential extraterrestrial (ET) material.

The Cr/Fe ratios for 4 of 10 spherules and 3 of 22 meltglass fragments were higher than the ET average ratios (<a href="#fg031">Figure 31B</a>).

Even so, identification of an impact crater is not required for acceptance as an impact event. Twenty-eight known spherule layers of different ages across the planet are widely accepted as representing impact events, though 21 are not associated with any known craters [<a href="#r81">81</a>, <a href="#r82">82</a>].

In addition, we propose exploring smaller depressions near the primary lake/depression to determine if they are also of potential impact origin.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2552">Several previous investigations have concluded that during airbursts at all altitudes, the incoming comet or asteroid is vaporized so that no fragments reach Earth’s surface [<a href="#r83">83</a>, <a href="#r84">84</a>]. Thus, the question arises whether the airburst proposed here is possible or plausible.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2560">While most incoming bolide material vaporizes during an airburst, it is indisputable that airburst fragments commonly reach Earth’s surface. For example, fragments of the Sikhote-Alin iron meteorite struck Siberia in 1947, distributing ~8500 pieces totaling more than 23,000 kg across 1.6 square km. This event produced more than 100 small impact craters ranging from 0.5 to 26 m diameter [<a href="#r85">85</a>]. Argentina’s Campo del Cielo meteorite field contains numerous meteorites that produced &gt;100 shallow craters up to 26.5 m in diameter and 6 m in depth. Shock pressures were sufficiently energetic for the Sikhote-Alin and Campo del Cielo airbursts to produce multiple small, shallow, shock-generated craters in unconsolidated surficial sediments.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2565">Although the airburst over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013 was a much smaller event than the ones discussed above, fragments still reached Earth’s surface.

Melted and shocked quartz during an airburst</h4><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2608">Airbursts are generally considered to be low-shock events, so the question arises as to whether the required conditions could have occurred to produce shocked quartz in a Perkins airburst. In conducting laboratory experiments to investigate shock quartz, Christie et al.

The evidence indicates pressures equal to or greater than this value produced the materials at Perkins. In addition to high pressures, Gratz et al. [<a href="#r114">114</a>] found that thermally induced shock metamorphism can occur when high temperatures (≥1710°C) create fractures in quartz that are injected with melted silica. Ernstson performed similar laboratory experiments [<a href="#r115">115</a>, <a href="#r116">116</a>] and observed spallation, during which quartz fractures into multiple fragments through interaction with a compression wave.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2625">The results of Christie et al. and Ernstson suggest a plausible formation mechanism for the Perkins shocked quartz and microbrecciated quartz. Relatively low-energy airburst/impact shockwave pulses could have created compression fractures in quartz grains, and spallation created tensile fractures. Lastly, after the grains fractured, they filled with melted silica either from the grain surface or from melted silica and vapor carried by the high-pressure, high-velocity airburst cloud.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2627">Melted silica within breccia is the primary characteristic distinguishing impact breccia from other geologically deformed breccia [<a href="#r117">117</a>]. The material at Perkins can be identified as non-authigenic melted silica due to several factors. The glass is determined to be amorphous using crossed polars, thus confirming that it is noncrystalline, and this characteristic eliminates authigenic quartz overgrowth and quartz cement, which are crystalline. Next, SEM imagery detected no micro-spheres in the glass, thus eliminating chert, agate, chalcedony, and other microcrystalline or cryptocrystalline varieties of quartz. Lastly, SEM-EDS indicates that the oxygen/silicon ratio of the glass is ≤53/47 wt%, the stoichiometric ratio of quartz, thus indicating that the glass is not hydrated silica (hyalite at ~66/34 wt% ratio). Therefore, high-temperature melted silica is the only remaining possibility for the Perkins glass.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2632">The shocked quartz and vesicular microbrecciated quartz were observed at all three Perkins locations, often fused to spherules and meltglass, suggesting that they formed simultaneously. As discussed above under potential origins, the most parsimonious explanation is that it resulted from a cosmic impact event.</p></div><div><a id="s21"><!--

Hydrocode model of a touch-down airburst</h4><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2637">Here, we explore the possibility that the evidence at Perkins resulted from a touch-down airburst, in which the near-surface detonation of an asteroid or comet produced high-velocity fragments that struck the ground with sufficient velocity to create a shallow crater. In addition, the event generated the high-temperature, high-pressure conditions necessary to produce spherules, meltglass, shocked quartz, and the other observed materials.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2639">Multiple studies [<a href="#r2">2</a>, <a href="#r12">12</a>, <a href="#r118">118</a>, <a href="#r119">119</a>] have produced hydrocode models or reported evidence that airbursts/impacts can produce high-velocity fragments that strike the ground with sufficient velocity to produce glass-filled shocked quartz. In addition, a hydrocode model produced by Boslough and Crawford [<a href="#r62">62</a>, <a href="#r120">120</a>, <a href="#r121">121</a>] of a 108-Mt airburst demonstrated that such events can excavate unconsolidated sediment, melt surficial sediments at ~5800 K, and create a crater (<a href="#fg034">Figure 34</a>). Boslough and Crawford [<a href="#r62">62</a>, <a href="#r121">121</a>] describe the theoretical process by which airbursts can produce meltglass. This process is essential, so we quote their conclusion in its entirety. For some airbursts, “the hot jet of vaporized projectile (the descending ‘fireball’) makes contact with the Earth’s surface, where it expands radially. During the time of radial expansion, the fireball can maintain temperatures well above the melting temperature of silicate minerals, and its radial velocity can exceed the sound speed in air. We suggest that the surface materials can ablate by radiative/convective melting under these conditions, and then quench rapidly to form glass after the fireball cools and recedes.”</p><div id="fg034"><a id="fg034"><!--

The impactor initially broke up into multiple fragments as an airburst at an altitude of 108 km, and these fragments struck Earth’s surface as a low-density cloud traveling at 0.975 km/s with an impact energy of 0.64 Mt (<a href="#fg035">Figures 35</a> and <a href="#fg036">36</a>). The largest cloud of impactor fragments was modeled as ~100 m in diameter, although it should be noted that this was not a solid object but rather a high-velocity dispersed cloud of debris. This cloud produced a modeled elliptical crater 363 m long and 77 m wide, corresponding well with the 300-m span of the seasonal lake/depression at Perkins. The floor of the modeled crater was underlain by a lens of meltglass tens of meters below the surface, too deep for us to detect with our 6-m test wells.</p><div id="fg035"><a id="fg035"><!--

The impact or airburst had sufficient energy to create a shallow-rimmed crater or multiple smaller craters that overlapped to become the modern lake/depression (<a href="#fg037">Figure 37</a>). Smaller fragments struck the ground in a shotgun-like blast, forming multiple ephemeral craters across the site. The airburst/impact ejected surficial sediments that formed a raised rim around the crater, an ejecta blanket to the west, and ‘wings’ of impact-related debris.</p><div id="fg037"><a id="fg037"><!--

Radiocarbon dating suggests an age close to the onset of the Younger Dryas (~12,800 cal BP). Geochemical comparisons and thermal estimations indicate that formation temperatures ≥2000°C exceeded those achievable through anthropogenic, volcanic, or tectonic processes.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2857">Hydrocode modeling supports the hypothesis that a low-altitude airburst/impact could have generated the observed depression and associated deposits. While alternative explanations for this material, including natural fluvial or anthropogenic processes, were considered, they fail to account for the full suite of geological and geochemical evidence.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2859">We propose that the Perkins lake/depression represents an airburst/impact crater associated with the Younger Dryas onset and, as such, contributes to the broader understanding of the frequency and effects of cosmic impact events on Earth’s surface environments.</p><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2861">Recent extensive research and observations at this site and elsewhere imply that airbursts have been more common than currently accepted and that numerous easily overlooked such airburst/impact events may have occurred in the past.</p></div></div></section><section xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" id="d16462011e2864"><div><p dir="auto" id="d16462011e2867">We gratefully acknowledge the cooperation of Fitzenreiter family members: Walter Leo Fitzenreiter Jr. (deceased), Sarah Fitzenreiter, Walter and Tanya Eubanks, Garren Fitzenreiter, and Seth Dinger.
