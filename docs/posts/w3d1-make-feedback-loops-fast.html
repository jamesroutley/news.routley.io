      <div><p>I started doing a bit more background reading for an event I&#39;ll be heading to later in the week, organized by Modal. Erik Bernhardsson founded Modal, and while I absolutely love his <a href="https://erikbern.com/2021/07/07/the-data-team-a-short-story">post</a> on building data teams, the quote is from a <a href="https://erikbern.com/2022/12/07/what-ive-been-working-on-modal">post</a> about Modal itself.</p><blockquote>I spent a lot of time as a CTO, and if I had to condense how to make engineers productive into one thing, it would be something like: make the feedback loops fast.</blockquote><p>Another interesting thread in the post is data as a new engineering discipline, and how the &#39;book of best practices&#39; is still currently being written. Related to this is machine learning engineering; both are relatively new and enjoying a resurgence on the back of the popularity of generative AI.</p></div>
