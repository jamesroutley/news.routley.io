I pulled out the Filteroff app and was showing her how it works. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6197f007be798d88368f80d7/623091bef06d7ae77c0fe4bf_screenshots.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>&#34;It&#39;s so sterile,&#34; she said. &#34;Huh?&#34; I asked. &#34;Yeah, it&#39;s just so boring. So <strong>sterile</strong>.&#34;</p><p>My immediate reaction was to get defensive. But, curiosity got the best of me— &#34;Hmm... Can you show me something that isn&#39;t &#39;sterile&#39;?&#34; She quickly opens her phone and navigates to partiful.com and shows it to me. &#34;It&#39;s so exciting. Every time I open it, it makes me happy. Sometimes they have doge pop up!&#34;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6197f007be798d88368f80d7/62308eb285112941662e5fa3_partiful.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>I stare at the page for a second. My brain hurts. I hate it. It felt... distracting, maximal, cluttered, weirdly transparent. Little sparkles animate over the page.</p><p>&#34;How old are you?&#34; I asked. </p><p>&#34;Twenty-five.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Of course you are.&#34; </p><p>Okay... I didn&#39;t say that last bit, but I definitely thought it.</p><h3>Boring on purpose</h3><p>Looking back at our app, I&#39;m realizing... the UI <em>is</em> kinda boring. It&#39;s built more like a utility app. This was intentional.</p><p>Filteroff is video speed dating. We launched our app prior to the pandemic, and have people aged 18 to 75 using it. A lot of the video speed dating UX paradigms are complex, and novel for many users. </p><blockquote>&#34;How do I turn on my camera?&#34; is an all too common email we receive.</blockquote><p>Making the UI too busy seems a distraction. </p><p>But, Gen-Z knows how to turn on their camera. I was met with similar responses about our app after asking a few more people in their 20s. Yeah, it&#39;s a tiny sample size, but many do not like &#34;millennial minimalism.&#34;</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6197f007be798d88368f80d7/623093a7c9dbece900e61086_cdnassets.hw.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption><em>The &#34;millenial kitchen&#34; (builder.com)</em></figcaption></figure><h3>A new UI theme</h3><p>One idea I had was tweaking the app theme based on age. If you&#39;re a member of Gen-Z, you&#39;d see a Gen-Z theme. But, to be honest, what the heck is Gen-Z design? Is it &#34;fun?&#34; Us millennials aren&#39;t fun. Maybe it&#39;s the opposite of minimalist?</p><p>I went to Pexels and searched for &#34;Gen-Z&#34; and it showed me pictures of a woman holding a bush... </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6197f007be798d88368f80d7/62309c0bce909f4131e10dff_Screen%20Shot%202022-03-15%20at%209.58.12%20AM.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption><em>Filteroff for Gen-Z</em></figcaption></figure><p>I&#39;m not sure if we&#39;ll actually go through with it.
