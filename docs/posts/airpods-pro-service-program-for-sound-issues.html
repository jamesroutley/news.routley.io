				<p>Apple has determined that a small percentage of AirPods Pro may experience sound issues. Affected units were manufactured before October 2020.</p>
<p>An affected AirPods Pro may exhibit one or more of the following behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crackling or static sounds that increase in loud environments, with exercise or while talking on the phone</li>
<li>Active Noise Cancellation not working as expected, such as a loss of bass sound, or an increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise</li>
</ul>

</div>
		</div>
	<div>
  			<p>Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider will service the affected AirPods Pro (left, right or both), free of charge.</p>
		</div>
	<div>
  			<p><span>Note: No other AirPods models are part of this program</span></p>
