      <p><strong>Released on December 5, 2022.</strong></p>

<p>Inkscape 1.2.2 is a <b>maintenance and bugfix release</b>, which brings you <b> 4 crash fixes, over 25 bug fixes, 5 fixes for extension bugs and 13 improved user interface translations</b>.</p>

<p>Notably, the <strong>OpenClipart import is now available to everyone</strong>, regardless of the selected packaging format or operating system, <strong>spellchecking</strong> finally works on macOS, <strong>performance</strong> is improved (in exchange for dithering disabled by default), extensions that modify colors can now also <strong>modify colors in patterns</strong> again, and for our maker community, we fixed some issues with the <strong>measure tool</strong>, the <strong>DXF14 export</strong> and with <strong>hairline strokes</strong>.</p>

<p><u><strong>Note for macOS users:</strong></u></p>

<p>Do not update to macOS Ventura if you rely on Inkscape! There is an unresolved issue that currently affects all GTK3 based apps on macOS Ventura, making the app unresponsive to certain mouse events. (GTK is used by many different programs, and builds those programs&#39; user interfaces for you to interact with.)</p>
