            <div><p>China has introduced guidelines to phase out US microprocessors from Intel and AMD from government personal computers and servers, the Financial Times reported on Sunday (Mar 24).</p>

<p>The procurement guidance also seeks to sideline Microsoft&#39;s Windows operating system and foreign-made database software in favour of domestic options, the report said.</p>

<p>Government agencies above the township level have been told to include criteria requiring &#34;safe and reliable&#34; processors and operating systems when making purchases, the newspaper said.</p>

<p>China&#39;s industry ministry in late December issued a statement with three separate lists of CPUs, operating systems and centralised database deemed &#34;safe and reliable&#34; for three years after the publication date, all from Chinese companies, Reuters checks showed.</p>

<p>The State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for the council, China&#39;s Cabinet, did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.</p>

<p>Intel and AMD did not immediately respond to Reuters&#39; request for comment.</p>

<p>The US has been aiming to boost domestic semiconductor output and reduce reliance on China and Taiwan with the Biden administration&#39;s 2022 CHIPS and Science Act.</p>

<p>It is designed to bolster US semiconductors and contains financial aid for domestic production with subsidies for production of advanced chips.</p></div>
