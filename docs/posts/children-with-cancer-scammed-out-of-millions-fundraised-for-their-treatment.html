He is pale and has no hair.</p><p>&#34;I am seven years old and I have cancer,&#34; he says. &#34;Please save my life and help me.&#34;</p><p>Khalil - who is pictured above in a still from the film - didn&#39;t want to record this, says his mother Aljin. She had been asked to shave his head, and then a film crew hooked him up to a fake drip, and asked his family to pretend it was his birthday. They had given him a script to learn and recite in English.</p><p>And he didn&#39;t like it, says Aljin, when chopped onions were placed next to him, and menthol put under his eyes, to make him cry.</p><p>Aljin agreed to it because, although the set-up was fake, Khalil really did have cancer. She was told this video would help crowdfund money for better treatment. And it did raise funds - $27,000 (£20,204), according to a campaign we found in Khalil&#39;s name.</p><p>But Aljin was told the campaign had failed, and says she received none of this money - just a $700 (£524) filming fee on the day. One year later, Khalil died.</p><p>Across the world, desperate parents of sick or dying children are being exploited by online scam campaigns, the BBC World Service has discovered. The public have given money to the campaigns, which claim to be fundraising for life-saving treatment. We have identified 15 families who say they got little to nothing of the funds raised and often had no idea the campaigns had even been published, despite undergoing harrowing filming.</p><p>Nine families we spoke to - whose campaigns appear to be products of the same scam network - say they never received anything at all of the $4m (£2.9m) apparently raised in their names.</p><p>A whistleblower from this network told us they had looked for &#34;beautiful children&#34; who &#34;had to be three to nine years old… without hair&#34;.</p><p>We have identified a key player in the scam as an Israeli man living in Canada called Erez Hadari. </p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Watch how three children, including Ana from Colombia, appeared in campaign videos</figcaption></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Our investigation began in October 2023, when a distressing YouTube advert caught our attention. &#34;I don&#39;t want to die,&#34; a girl called Alexandra from Ghana sobbed. &#34;My treatments cost a lot.&#34;</p><p>A crowdfunding campaign for her appeared to have raised nearly $700,000 (£523,797).</p><p>We saw more videos of sick children from around the world on YouTube, all strikingly similar - slickly produced, and seemingly having raised huge amounts of money. They all conveyed a sense of urgency, using emotive language.</p><p>We decided to investigate further.</p><p>The campaigns with the biggest apparent international reach were under the name of an organisation called Chance Letikva (Chance for Hope, in English) - registered in Israel and the US.</p><p>Identifying the children featured was difficult. We used geolocation, social media and facial recognition software to find their families, based as far apart as Colombia and the Philippines.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/56fb/live/707275a0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Chance Letikva A fundraising campaign page for Ana - it shows her crying, wearing a nasal tube, and the caption at the top of the page reads &#34;Two months to live&#34; with a heart emoji "/><span>Chance Letikva</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>A Chance Letikva campaign for Ana in Colombia - falsely claiming she had two months to live </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>While it was difficult to know for sure if the campaign websites&#39; cash totals were genuine, we donated small amounts to two of them and saw the totals increase by those amounts.</p><p>We also spoke to someone who says she gave $180 (£135) to Alexandra&#39;s campaign and was then inundated with requests for more, all written as if sent by Alexandra and her father.</p><p>In the Philippines, Aljin Tabasa told us her son Khalil had fallen ill just after his seventh birthday.</p><p>&#34;When we found out it was cancer it felt like my whole world shattered,&#34; she says.</p><p>Aljin says treatment at their local hospital in the city of Cebu was slow, and she had messaged everyone she could think of for help.

When we told him they had not received any of the campaigns&#39; donations he said he was &#34;puzzled&#34; and was &#34;very sorry for the families&#34;.</p><p>Nobody named Erez appears on registration documents for Chance Letikva. But two of its campaigns we investigated had also been promoted by another organisation called Walls of Hope, registered in Israel and Canada. Documents list the director in Canada as Erez Hadari.</p><p>Photos of him online show him at Jewish religious events in the Philippines, New York and Miami. We showed Aljin, and she said it was the same person she had met.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>We asked Mr Hadari about his involvement in a campaign in the Philippines. He did not respond.</p><p>We visited further families whose campaigns were either organised by, or linked to, Mr Hadari - one in a remote indigenous community in Colombia, and another in Ukraine.</p><p>As with Khalil&#39;s case, local fixers had got in touch to offer help. The children were filmed and made to cry or fake tears for a nominal fee, but never received any further money.</p><p>In Sucre, north-west Colombia, Sergio Care says he initially refused this help. He had been approached by someone called Isabel, he says, who offered financial assistance after his eight-year-old daughter, Ana, was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour.</p><p>But Isabel came looking for him at the hospital treating Ana, he says, accompanied by a man who said he worked for an international NGO.</p><p>The description Sergio gave of the man matched that of Erez Hadari - he then recognised him in a photo we showed him.</p><p>&#34;He gave me hope... I didn&#39;t have any money for the future.&#34;</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/44c1/live/e6eca8e0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/44c1/live/e6eca8e0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/44c1/live/e6eca8e0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/44c1/live/e6eca8e0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/44c1/live/e6eca8e0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/44c1/live/e6eca8e0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/44c1/live/e6eca8e0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/44c1/live/e6eca8e0-d4f9-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png.webp" loading="lazy" alt="An excerpt from a script given to Ana to learn - it shows stage directions, directing her and her dad on what to wear and how to behave, including tears from Ana.

We travelled to both, but found no sign of it.</p><p>And we discovered Chance Letikva seems to be one of many such organisations.</p><p>The man who filmed Viktoriia&#39;s campaign told our producer - who was posing as a friend of a sick child - that he works for other similar organisations.</p><p>&#34;Each time, it&#39;s a different one,&#34; the man - who had introduced himself as &#34;Oleh&#34; - told her. &#34;I hate to put it this way, but they work kind of like a conveyor belt.&#34;</p><p>&#34;About a dozen similar companies&#34; requested &#34;material&#34;, he said, naming two of them - Saint Teresa and Little Angels, both registered in the US.</p><p>When we checked their registration documents, we once again found Erez Hadari&#39;s name.</p><p>What is not clear is where the money raised for the children has gone.</p><p>More than a year after Viktoriia&#39;s filming, her mother Olena rang Oleh, who seems to go by Alex Kohen online, to find out. Shortly afterwards, someone from Chance Letikva called to say the donations had paid for advertising, she says.</p><p>This is also what Mr Hadari told Aljin, Khalil&#39;s mother, when she confronted him over the phone.</p><p>&#34;There is cost of advertising. So the company lost money,&#34; Mr Hadari told her, without giving any evidence to support this.</p><p>Charity experts told us advertising should not amount to more than 20% of the total raised by campaigns.</p><p>Someone previously employed to recruit children for Chance Letikva campaigns told us how those featured had been chosen.</p><p>They had been asked to visit oncology clinics, they said - speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><p>&#34;They were always looking for beautiful children with white skin. The child had to be three to nine years old. They had to know how to speak well. They had to be without hair,&#34; they told us.</p><p>&#34;They asked me for photos, to see if the child is right, and I would send it to Erez.&#34;</p><p>The whistleblower told us Mr Hadari would then send the photo on to someone else, in Israel, whose name they were never told.</p><p>As for Mr Hadari himself, we tried to reach him at two addresses in Canada but could not find him. He replied to one voice note we had sent him - asking about the money he had been apparently crowdfunding - by saying the organisation &#34;has never been active&#34;, without specifying which one. He did not respond to a further voice note and letter laying out all our questions and allegations.</p></div><figure><div data-component="image-block"><p><img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" aria-label="image unavailable"/><img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b676/live/3589b330-d51d-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Erez Hadari Erez Hadari is shown sitting in a plane - in what looks like first or business class - with a blue top and grey trousers, and is smiling, holding headphones"/><span>Erez Hadari</span></p></div><p data-component="caption-block"><figcaption>Erez Hadari sent this photo of himself to Khalil&#39;s mum, Aljin </figcaption></p></figure><div data-component="text-block"><p>Campaigns set up by Chance Letikva for two children who died - Khalil and a Mexican boy called Hector - still appear to be accepting money.</p><p>Chance Letikva&#39;s US branch appears to be linked to a new organisation called Saint Raphael, which has produced more campaigns - at least two of which seem to have been filmed in Angelholm clinic in Ukraine, as the clinic&#39;s distinctive wood panelling and staff uniforms can be seen.</p><p>Olena, Viktoriia&#39;s mother, says her daughter has been diagnosed with another brain tumour.
