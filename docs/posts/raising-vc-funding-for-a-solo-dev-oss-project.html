        <p>The open-source movement gave us many of the software such as operating systems, browsers and databases. They hold a prominent place in the world that we are living in today. The internal projects of large companies such as Kubernetes, React, Angular and Tensorflow that was later open-sourced have become industry standards, adding to the momentum of the OSS movement. Traditionally the OSS companies used to make money by selling support and services. This free software and paid support approach were adopted by many companies including pioneers like Redhat and MySQL. Now the open-source software  (OSS) has started eating into the SaaS space. Many OSS projects now have a hosted solution.</p><blockquote>For those who haven&#39;t heard about ToolJet, <a href="https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet">ToolJet</a>  ( <a href="https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet">https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet</a> ) is an open-source low-code framework for building custom internal tools. </blockquote><p>The first commit to our GitHub repository was on April 1, 2021, and we made the repository public on June 7, 2021, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27421408">launched it on Hackernews</a>. </p><p>The initial signs of product-community fit were seen when our GitHub repository got more than 1000 stars within 8 hours of HN launch. We have raised <strong>$1.55 million in funding</strong> within 2 weeks of the HN launch. </p><p>There are a lot of cool open-source projects out there. Hoping this article and our story will be helpful for someone who is looking to build a business around their open-source projects. </p><h3 id="what-were-our-options">What were our options?</h3><p>At the time of launch, the ToolJet team had only me as a full-time member. ToolJet was built with an aim of building a business around it. I tried to find investors for funding ToolJet from the very initial days. When we got some initial traction after the launch, there were a few options in front of us to build a company around ToolJet.</p><p><strong>a) Bootstrapping: </strong>Growing by using the money that your customers pay is a great concept. But during the early stages of a product, it might be hard to find such paying customers and I did not have enough savings to fund the project until that happens.</p><h3 id="why-did-we-choose-vc-funding">Why did we choose VC funding?</h3><p>We chose VC funding because we wanted to grow quickly. We realised that it could take us months to build the platform that we wanted to build if ToolJet becomes a side project. We wanted to accelerate our growth by expanding the team. </p><p>By choosing VC money, you also have to commit to an exit or a total failure. Also, this means you have to talk to a bunch of investors to get funded and to talk to those who funded you on a regular basis. On the bright side, you get to talk to amazing folks who have funded similar companies over the years ( or decades ) and have closely watched their journeys. </p><h3 id="is-it-for-everyone">Is it for everyone?</h3><p>Definitely not. There are many bootstrapped open-source companies making good revenue/profits. We chose this path because, maybe a decade later, we do not want to regret missing an opportunity to build something great just because we wanted to build it as a side project. </p><p><strong>The benefits of VC funding for OSS</strong></p><h3 id="the-timeline">The timeline</h3><p>March 2021 - I sold one of my side projects and quit the job and decided to work full-time on ToolJet for up to 6 months. </p><p>Since then - Expanding the team while improving the platform.</p><h3 id="how-we-raised-the-fund">How we raised the fund</h3><p>Before the launch, I reached out to the folks in my circle who could connect me to the investors. I also tried cold mailing a bunch of angel investors. Some of them were convinced about the vision but wanted to see some metrics to prove that it will work.</p><p>Raising funds can easily become a full-time job which mostly involves talking to many investors every day. The process of some of these investors can span over weeks. We wanted to close the round quickly and get back to product development. We were able to find investors who move quickly and this helped us spend less time looking for money and spend that time instead on what we really love.</p><h3 id="whats-next">What&#39;s next? </h3><p>We are a team of 12 now. Since the launch, we were able to build and ship a lot of awesome stuff such as real-time collaboration, integrations with cloud storage, a bunch of options to deploy ToolJet, integrations with new data sources, more than a dozen new widgets, etc. We also got contributions from more than 100 contributors who are from a dozen different countries.  With the constant feedback from the open-source community, we aim to build the platform that we envision over the next months and years. </p><p>We would love to hear your thoughts about ToolJet, here is our repository: <a href="https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet">https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet</a></p>
