    <h1>Classified fighter jet specs leaked on War Thunder forums</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>EXCLUSIVE – The War Thunder forums are at the centre of yet another controversy following the leak of classified documents related to the Eurofighter Typhoon’s radar systems.</h3><p>The discussion, which revolved around the scanning capabilities of the CAPTOR radar, led to a user posting restricted material in an attempt to prove their argument.</p><p>War Thunder, a free-to-play online combat game developed by Gaijin Entertainment, was launched in 2012, with development and operations now spread across Europe, including offices in Germany, Hungary, and Cyprus, and a team of 200 employees.</p><p>While the material was swiftly removed and the user suspended, this latest incident has reignited concerns about the repeated sharing of sensitive information on the platform.</p><p>A forum community manager addressed the situation, reminding users of the risks and responsibilities involved:</p><p><em>“I will take this opportunity to again remind everyone here, please do not, under any circumstances, try to post, share any sources unless you are 100% certain they are legally declassified and publicly safe for use. We will never handle or use them, and all it does is actively harm any possible future changes being possible by trying to use them. Do not do it. No good will ever come from it for you or the vehicle you are trying to post for.”</em></p><p>The user was warned before sharing the documents, but it appears they proceeded regardless, resulting in the immediate removal of the material. The Italian Ministry of Defence, whose documents may have been cited, has previously stated that manuals like these are excluded from public access for both security and commercial reasons.</p><h4>A Worrying Pattern</h4><p>This is not the first time War Thunder forums have faced issues with classified leaks. Previous incidents have involved technical details of the Challenger 2 tank, Leclerc main battle tank, and Chinese ammunition systems. Each case has underscored the platform’s struggle to balance enthusiasm for military accuracy with the protection of sensitive information.</p><blockquote data-secret="8OG5KnZmql"><p><a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/classified-specs-leaked-on-war-thunder-forum-for-third-time/">Classified specs leaked on War Thunder forum for third time</a></p></blockquote><h3>Radar Controversy</h3><p>The CAPTOR radar was at the heart of the debate. Discussions centred on comparisons between its mechanically scanning (CAPTOR-M) and electronically scanning (CAPTOR-E) variants, particularly the latter’s ability to reduce scanning times significantly. Players disagreed over the exact technical capabilities, prompting the ill-advised sharing of restricted data.</p><p>Moderators have clarified that any claims based on classified information will not be entertained and have reminded users that no in-game content will be adjusted based on unauthorised sources.</p><h3>Larger Implications</h3><p>The repeated leaks from these forums pose broader concerns, particularly regarding the unauthorised dissemination of restricted information in public spaces. Defence analysts warn that such actions can carry serious legal consequences and even impact the operational security of military platforms.</p><p>A contact in the defence industry, obviously wishing to remain anonymous, told me last night, <em>“These leaks might seem harmless to some, but they can have real-world consequences. Sharing restricted information, even in a gaming context, risks undermining the security of platforms and could lead to serious legal repercussions for those involved and potential harm to operational effectiveness and safety”.</em></p><hr/><p><em>At the UK Defence Journal, we aim to deliver accurate and timely news on defence matters.
