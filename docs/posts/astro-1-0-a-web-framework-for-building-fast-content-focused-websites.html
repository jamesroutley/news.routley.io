    <h1>Astro 1.0 – a web framework for building fast, content-focused websites</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><strong>We are thrilled to announce Astro v1.0: a web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.</strong></p>
<p>Over the last 16 months, <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> has grown from an empty repo to over 13,000 stars on <a href="https://github.com/withastro/astro">GitHub</a> and 30,000 early users around the world. The Astro documentation has been translated into 6 different languages, and Astro has already been deployed at amazing companies such as <a href="https://firebase.blog/">Firebase (Google)</a>, <a href="https://tech.trivago.com/">Trivago</a>, <a href="https://theguardian.engineering/">The Guardian</a>, and <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/">IKEA</a>.</p>
<p>Astro v1.0 includes a few new features and improvements since our original beta announcement back in April, including:</p>
<ul>

<p>To celebrate Astro v1.0, we kicked off a brand-new redesign of our website: <a href="https://astro.build">astro.build</a>.</p>

<p>A lot has changed since we first launched <a href="https://astro.build">astro.build</a>. Astro is no longer just a static-site builder. You can now build Astro to a dynamic, SSR-ready server on any popular hosting platform. Additionally, our ecosystem has exploded into 100+ integrations and keeps growing to cover more and more features and use-cases.</p>
<p>The new website tells our story better, with a fresh can of paint and a focus on content, performance, and community. (Plus, it goes <a href="https://astro.build/#warp-speed">warp speed</a>).</p>
<h2 id="what-people-are-saying">What People are Saying</h2>
<p>Astro works with the tools you already love, but this requires a lot of effort to get right. Luckily, Astro is supported by some amazing partners across the industry who support our vision for a faster web.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> — Astro’s Official Hosting Partner and long-time sponsor of the project — has worked side-by-side with our community for over a year on <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/frameworks/astro/">learning resources</a>, <a href="https://github.com/netlify-templates/astro-quickstart">starter templates</a>, <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/how-to-deploy-astro/">blog posts</a> and more. They’ve gone above and beyond to make sure that Astro websites run seamlessly on the Netlify platform.</p>

        <p><span>Astro was a catalyst that caused developers to ask, ‘Do we really need to ship all that JavaScript?’ The reintroduction of multi-page apps (MPAs) in a modern context is a huge opportunity for developers in the Jamstack ecosystem to make the web better for users. This vision of a better web is why Netlify is bullish on Astro — when you combine the performance and developer experience of Astro and Netlify together, you’re setting developers and users up for success.</span></p>

<p>As we began to prepare the Astro 1.0 release, we received even more kind words from some amazing developers across the ecosystem:</p>
<section>
    
    <blockquote>
        <p><span>It’s been a joy to sponsor Astro and help support the project as it now reaches v1.0. The team has done incredible work building an extensible framework that can adapt to any hosting provider, including Vercel.</span></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span>Astro has shown we can bring the simplicity of the early web back to modern web development. It unifies the web ecosystem such that no matter if you are using the most popular libraries with React to the newest compiled syntax from Svelte you feel equally at home. And it has been the home for people that care about getting the best load performance out of their Solid applications. That’s something that I get excited about.</span></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span>Astro has driven ground-breaking work to lower the friction building a fast experience for the web. If you want a great MPA alternative to SPAs that uses less-JavaScript without taking away modern DX, I strongly recommend trying it out.</span></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span> Astro is the framework that brings me the most joy to work with. I never feel locked in because I can switch from static to dynamic, from React to Svelte, from pre-built to server-rendered, all with minor changes. I’ve built three sites with Astro and Prismic and the developer experience has been delightful. I keep looking for more reasons to spin up new Astro + Prismic sites because it’s such a great pairing.</span></p>

        <p>The proliferation of Javascript frameworks has raised the bar for web developer tools. Sadly, it’s also lowered the bar for user experiences. <em>Not all websites need Javascript,</em> but the best frameworks are JS so the best devs find themselves compromising. I know I’m as guilty of that as anyone. Astro is the first web framework to make static as fast as JS for me as a developer.</p>

<p>Build with your favorite UI framework (React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, or Lit). Pull from your favorite content source (CMS, Markdown, Databases, and APIs). Deploy to your favorite hosting provider with a single command (Netlify, Vercel, AWS, Docker and more). That’s what Astro is all about.</p>
