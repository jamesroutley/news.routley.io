                        <p>because of his disappearance, i thought i would share a letter i had received from _why in 2005.  i had just started learning ruby after a year or so break from development and emailed him because i was trying to figure out the path to enlightenment. i’ve learned from this email to put less importance on what is right and instead try to learn from everything, including times when i’m completely wrong.</p><p>I’ve shortened the email slightly to keep focus.</p><blockquote><div><p>I do not write tests for my code.  I do not write very many comments.  I change styles very frequently.  And, most of all, I shun the predominant styles of coding because that would go against the very essence of experimentation.  In short: all I do is muck around.</p></div></blockquote> <p><span><a href="https://aberant.tumblr.com/post/167375099/a-letter-from-why">13 years ago</a></span>
