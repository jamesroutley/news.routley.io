<p>Today, I’m excited to share an exciting step forward for Atlassian. We’ve entered into an agreement to acquire The Browser Company of New York, the team behind the incredible Dia and Arc browsers.</p>



<p>By combining The Browser Company’s passion for building browsers people love with Atlassian’s deep expertise on how the world’s best teams operate, we have the opportunity to transform how work gets done in the AI era.</p>

<h2>A Browser for Doing, Not Just Browsing</h2>



<p>Today’s browsers weren’t built for work. They were built for browsing – reading the news, watching videos, looking up recipes. And sure, you may do some of those things in your browser during the workday, but most of those tabs represent a task that needs to get done. A meeting to schedule. A design to review. A work item to update in Jira. A memo to write. Before you know it, it’s hard to see through the forest of tabs.</p>

<p>Here’s the rub: your current browser isn’t designed to help you move any of that work forward. It was designed before the explosion of SaaS apps, and well before the current AI revolution. It’s a bystander in your workflow, treating every tab the same, with no awareness of your work context, no understanding of your priorities, and no help connecting the dots between your tools.</p>



<p>It’s time for a browser that’s actually built for work – a browser that helps you do, not just browse.</p>



<h2>Making Dia the Knowledge Worker’s Browser</h2>



<p>Knowledge workers need a browser designed for their specific needs, not one that’s been built for everyone on the planet. That’s what we will build with The Browser Company. Our vision is to make Dia the browser:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optimized for the SaaS apps where you spend your day.</strong> Whether you’re working in email or a project management tool or a design app, your tabs will be enriched with context that helps move your work forward.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Packed with AI skills</strong> and your personal work memory to connect the dots between your apps, tabs, and tasks.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Built with trust and security in mind</strong>, so you can bring it to the office. While <a href="https://www.inforisktoday.in/whitepapers/gartner-report-future-enterprise-browsers-w-15316">85% of enterprise workflows</a> occur within web browsers, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-04-29-gartner-predicts-25-percent-of-organizations-will-use-secure-enterprise-browsers-to-enhance-remote-access-and-endpoint-security-by-2028">less than 10%</a> of organizations have adopted a secure browser. Security, compliance, and admin controls will be baked into every aspect of Dia.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>



<p>We are set to create a browser knowledge workers will love.</p>



<p>Together, we’re sprinting toward this opportunity, leveraging each other’s strengths. I am stoked for the road ahead and can’t wait to see how we will extend Atlassian’s mission – to unleash the potential of every team – to the browser.</p>
