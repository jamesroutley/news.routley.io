  <p>
   For 46 days, I&#39;m trying to spend less than $2.50 a day on food.  This is an
   account of the food, the costs, the science, and the fun of that experiment.

  <h2><a name="Why">Why?</a></h2>
  <p>
   I love food and I love to cook. I love to study the science of cooking.
   I&#39;m very lucky—I&#39;m not in a position that I <em>have</em> to strongly
   limit my food expenses, but I have always wanted to see how well I could
   cook and eat on a limited budget.  It would encourage me to think about new
   ingredients, new techniques, and new dishes.  I love cooking competition
   shows like <i>Iron Chef</i>, and enjoy cooking with limited
   ingredients, or cooking with a lot of a specific ingredient that someone
   dumps in my lap.
  </p>
  
  <p>
   Okay, that&#39;s only part of my inspiration.  I used to have a huge box of
   <i>Richie Rich</i> comic books that I bought from my friend for $3.  In
   case you&#39;re not familiar with all of the employees of the Rich family,
   their chef was Chef Pierre, the world&#39;s greatest chef.  One time, Chef
   Pierre was kidnapped and held by a bunch of criminals.  The criminals told
   Chef Pierre that he had to cook for them—<em>but they only had potato
   chips and ketchup!</em>.  Not a problem for the world&#39;s greatest chef!  He
   created food that was so delicious that the criminals quickly got
   fat—so fat that they couldn&#39;t get through the entrance to their
   hideout!  Chef Pierre then escaped by simply walking out unchallenged!
   (After which, Mr. Rich&#39;s security force swept in and cut all the criminals&#39;
   heads off.)

  </p><p>
   In any case, I always wanted to be <em>that good</em>, and be <em>that
   versatile</em> with ingredients: so good that I could make a good meal out
   of whatever&#39;s on hand.  I&#39;d love to be on a cooking challenge show, and see
   how well I could do with constraints and surprises, and with limited
   ingredients (like whatever&#39;s on a great sale, or your neighbor drops on
   your doorstep.)  I consider this my preparation.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Why250">Why $2.50 a day?</a></h2>
  <p>
   It seemed like a fairly challenging target; enough so that I&#39;d have to
   think harder and perhaps learn more.  When I started this challenge for the
   first time in 2014, a friend of mine noted that in nursing school, they
   were challenged to eat on $5/day.  (And record their nutrition and caloric
   intake.)  I estimated some of my meal costs, and decided that $2.50/day
   would be challenging, but safe and still fun.
  </p>

  <h2>Play Along</h2>
  <p>
   I encourage you to try challenging yourself to make meals for whatever
   price you care to choose, for whatever duration you choose, whether it&#39;s
   for 45 days, or once a week, or whatever.  Please let me know what you do,
   either by email at <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com"><i>eliasen@mindspring.com</i></a>
   or on  Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/aeliasen" target="_blank">@aeliasen</a>.
   I&#39;ll share good recipes and recommendations on here.  Also, share food with
   others and donate to your local food banks!
  </p>

  <h2><a name="RulesAndGuidelines">Rules and Guidelines</a></h2>
  <p>
   I&#39;ve set some rules and guidelines for myself to follow:
  </p>

  <ol>
   <li><b>Have Fun!</b>  This is a fun experiment.  I <em>get to</em> make
    yummy food that I&#39;m proud of and that I&#39;m happy to eat!  If I&#39;m not having
    fun and eating great food, I&#39;m doing it wrong.

   </li><li><b>$2.50 a day.</b> I could do this a lot of different ways, such as
   <em>averaging</em> food costs over 45 days.  However, I think that setting
    an approximate limit of $2.50 <em>each and every day</em> is a stricter
    constraint.  (As an engineer, I find strict constraints freeing.  It
    reduces the number of possibilities you have to consider.)  I feel I&#39;ll
    have to think a bit more and learn more with the stronger constraint.  If I
    have money left over after a day, I&#39;m generally not going to let that &#34;roll
    over&#34; to the next day.  This <em>doesn&#39;t</em> mean that I can&#39;t make a big
    batch of something that costs $10 to make, and then eat it for 4 days!

   </li><li><b>Be Safe!</b> Maintain and track nutrition, get enough calories, and
    don&#39;t eat rotten food.  (I would say &#34;I&#39;m not going to dumpster dive&#34; but
    after watching the fascinating Documentary <a href="http://www.divethefilm.com/" target="_blank"><i>Dive!</i></a>, I
    think that&#39;s a valid approach!)
    
   </li><li><b>Share Food!</b>  I&#39;m going to share the food I make with others.
    That&#39;s part of the fun.  So I&#39;m going to report my costs as single-person
    costs here.  That said, I&#39;m not going to &#34;cheat&#34; by buying bulk
    ingredients in huge quantities that I can&#39;t properly preserve and use.
    When I find good deals, I&#39;m going to buy more for food banks, too.
    
   </li><li><b>Share Recipes and Techniques!</b>  That&#39;s the point of this blog.  I
    hope if you have good recipes and ideas, you&#39;ll <a href="mailto:eliasen@mindspring.com">share them with me.</a>

   </li><li><b>Track and Minimize Waste.</b>  Food that I don&#39;t use needs to be
    factored into my costs.  Plan meals to prevent spoilage.  Learn to
    preserve.

   </li><li><b>Gifts are Free!</b> If someone gives me food (like the awesome
    canned fruits my Aunt gives out for Christmas,) I consider it free.  If
    you have excesses of food, give them to your friends and neighbors.

   </li><li><b>Don&#39;t make myself tired of my favorite foods.</b> I don&#39;t have a
    membership to a Costco or other membership warehouse, and I&#39;m not planning
    to get one for this experiment. I used to have one, but with 1 or 2 people,
    there was hardly anything in quantities that I could use in time.
    (Especially when sharing a freezer between 4 guys in college.)  I&#39;m going
    to buy what I can conveniently buy and store, (and not eat tater tots for a
    solid month straight like I did in college.  I loved tater tots before that
    and couldn&#39;t stand them for years afterwards.)

   </li><li><b>Be realistic.</b>  I&#39;m not going to drive across town because they
    have a slightly cheaper deal on chicken wings.  I&#39;m not going to spend all
    day clipping coupons.  I&#39;m going to shop pretty much like I always have.
    I will look into ways of getting food cheaper, though.

   </li><li><b>Be efficient.</b> Especially with my time.  Making big batches and
    eating the same thing for several meals is one of the secrets of
    efficiency.  Spending part of a day making freezable food that will feed
    you for weeks is incredibly efficient.
    
   </li><li><b>Keep on Sciencing!</b>  Yes, I&#39;ve built my own sous vide cooking
    apparatus.  I made molecular gastronomy kits for my relatives for
    Christmas.  I buy sciencey cooking books.  I <em>will not</em> apologize
    for busting out the science or a cool apparatus.

   </li><li><b>Don&#39;t burden others.</b>  If I want to go with friends to dinner, I
    will!  I will order whatever I&#39;d normally order.  I won&#39;t make my friends
    worry about my experiment, and I certainly don&#39;t want people not to invite
    me.  I won&#39;t be a food snob or a martyr.  This is a <em>fun</em>
    experiment.

   </li><li><b>Demonstrate Calculating Costs and Nutrition.</b>  I&#39;ve developed an
    awesome calculating tool and programming language called <a href="https://amontalenti.com/frinkdocs/" target="_blank">Frink</a> that helps make calculations with units of
    measure easy.  Interspersed with this document will be calculations that
    demonstrate how easy Frink makes it to calculate things!

   </li><li><b>Exceeding my budget is not failure.</b> As an engineer, I know that
    everything you try isn&#39;t a success the first time.  Every day, I&#39;ll try to
    analyze and point out how I could have done better, and can do better the
    next time.  In science, a negative result is every bit as important as a
    positive result.  To quote Thomas Edison, when asked why thousands of his
    experiments on batteries didn&#39;t produce a working result: &#34;Results! Why,
    man, I have gotten a lot of results!  I know several thousand things that
    won’t work!&#34; <a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/07/31/edison-lot-results/">--Edison: His Life and Inventions, 1910</a>.
  </li></ol>

  <h2><a name="Day1">Day 1 - Tomato Soup and Two Toasted Cheese Sandwiches</a></h2>
  <p>
   The first day, not coincidentally, coincided with Ash Wednesday, the first
   day of Lent.  Since that&#39;s typically a date of fasting, I&#39;m having a single
   meal.  But one of my favorites—good old Campbell&#39;s tomato soup and a
   couple of toasted cheese sandwiches!  And they were <em>proper</em> toasted
   cheese sandwiches.  Butter the bread on the outsides, fill them with good
   cheese, and cook them in an electric frying pan at 350 °F for a couple
   minutes on each side.
  </p>

  <p>
   I forgot to take pictures, but <em>you know what a toasted-cheese sandwich
    and tomato soup looks like.</em>
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day1MeasuringCheese">Measuring Ingredients</a></h3>
  <p>
   I&#39;m not always going to remember to measure and weigh my ingredients, but I
   did today, so I&#39;ll describe the process briefly.  A digital kitchen scale
   is very very useful for many types of cooking.
  </p>

  <p>
   I like my tomato soup made with milk, so I added 1 can of milk.  Now, a
   digression:
  </p>

  <div>
   <h4><a name="OuncesVsFluidOunces">Ounces vs. Fluid Ounces</a></h4>
   <p>
    A quick digression:  Ounces (and pounds and kilograms) are a unit of
    <em>mass</em>.  &#34;Fluid ounces&#34; (also written fl.oz.) are a unit of
    <em>volume</em>.  Don&#39;t confuse them.
   </p><p>
    The labels on liquids and semi-liquids (like mayonnaise) is usually
    indicated in fluid ounces (volume.)  The labels on solids and canned goods
    is usually labeled in ounces (mass.)
   </p>
   
   <p>
    (By the way, if you think that a pound or an ounce is a unit of
    <em>weight</em>, and not mass, that&#39;s a common (but potentially dangerous)
    misconception.  Read the full discussion of this in <a href="http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/faq.html#pound" target="-blank">this
    Frink FAQ entry.</a>)
   </p>
  </div>

  <p>
   Okay, back to the topic.  I buy my milk by the gallon (volume) but the can
   of soup is marked by the <em>mass</em> it contains.  I wanted to measure
   the volume of the can.  The easiest way to do that, using just a scale, is
   to weigh the can filled with water, and then weigh the can empty and
   subtract the weights.  This gives you the weight of water that filled the
   can.  Fortunately, our units of mass and volume are calibrated around water.
  </p>

  <p>
   The following are all basically equivalent statements:
  </p>

  <ul>
   <li>1 gram of water fills 1 milliliter.
   </li><li>1 gram of water fills 1 cubic centimeter, or 1 cc, or 1 cm<sup>3</sup>.
    (That is, a cube 1 centimeter on a side.  Note that this is the same as a
    milliliter.) 
   </li><li>1 kilogram of water fills one liter.
   </li><li>1 kilogram of water fills a cube 10 cm on a side (this is the same as a
    liter.)
   </li><li>1 ounce of water fills 1 fluid ounce.
   </li><li>1 pound of water fills one (U.S.) pint. (a pint is 16 fluid ounces.)
   </li><li>The density of water is 1 kilogram / liter.
   </li><li>The density of water is 1 gram / cm<sup>3</sup>.
   </li><li>The density of water is 1 ounce / floz.
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   These rules make it easy.  The can, filled with water, was 10.7 ounces 
   heavier than the empty can, so it contained 10.7 fluid ounces of water.
   Since a gallon of milk cost $2.99, the total milk cost was $0.25.
  </p>

  <p>
   I used up the last of a bit of fancy yummy shredded Tillamook Italian
   3-cheese (mozzarella, smoked Provolone and Parmesan!) that I still had
   open, so the cheese price was higher than some cheaper cheese that I bought
   later. (Again, no waste!)  We&#39;ll call it $6 / lb.  But how do you weigh
   shredded cheese?  You can&#39;t weigh the cheese first and then put it on the
   sandwich, because how will you know how much you&#39;re going to need?  I
   weighed the cheese by weighing the plate + bread before and after putting
   cheese on the bread and subtracting the difference.  It turned out to be 58
   g of cheese (total) for 2 sandwiches.
  </p>

  <p>
   I even measured the butter on the bread!  I didn&#39;t remember until buttering
   the last sandwich, and I didn&#39;t want to get butter all over my scale, so I
   weighed the butter dish + butter before and after buttering the last
   sandwich.  There was 16 g of butter for one sandwich (2 pieces of bread),
   so a whopping 32 grams for 2 sandwiches.  That amount surprised me.  When
   butter is $3.69 / lb, that comes to $0.26 of butter.  Surprising.  Hidden
   costs like this can add up!  I have to be careful not to miss them!
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day1Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>A big part of eating inexpensively is watching for stuff to go on sale.
    Results that I can obtain today, I may not be able to obtain tomorrow!
   </li><li>Dollar Tree sells 41% larger cans of Campbell&#39;s tomato soup (15.2 oz
    vs. 10.75 oz) for $1.00.  (Safeway&#39;s advertised &#34;everyday price&#34; is $0.91,
    making Dollar Tree&#39;s offering 1.29 times as efficient.)
   </li><li>Look into house brands or giant cans of soup?
   </li><li>I can make <em>huge</em> batches of amazing soup much cheaper.  Stay
    tuned!
   </li><li>I&#39;m using up existing food in my fridge for the first few days.  My
    costs should decrease as I start planning and buying better.
   </li><li>A good part of this exercise will be to develop and memorize &#34;rules of
    thumb&#34; to estimate how much a portion of food costs.
   </li><li>Rule of thumb:  A cup of milk costs about $0.20.
   </li><li>Rule of thumb:  A stick of butter can cost around $1.00.
   </li><li>Rule of thumb:  A tablespoon of butter costs about $0.12 (there are 8
    tablespoons in a stick of butter.)
   </li><li>Where is the &#34;cent&#34; sign on my keyboard?  My TRS-80 used to have one!
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   <i>Note:</i> The half can of milk and half can of soup was because I wasn&#39;t
   eating alone!  Again, the costs that I&#39;m going to list here are for
   the portions that I personally eat, even if I share the meal with others.
   I also probably paid less for the tomato soup, but I don&#39;t have that old
   receipt.
  </p>

  <p>
   I mentioned homemade kimchi here, but I&#39;ll describe that another day when
   I have less to write about!
  </p>

  <div>
  <h4>Frink Calculations</h4>
  <p>
   I mentioned before that I&#39;ve created a calculating tool / programming
   language called <a href="https://amontalenti.com/frinkdocs/" target="_blank">Frink</a> which is
   great for helping with physical calculations.  I&#39;m including some sample
   calculations so you can see how easy Frink makes calculating costs.  The
   above calculations were:
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    milkcost = 2.99 dollars / gallon</code>
   <code>
    0.2499453125 dollar (currency)
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    cheesecost = 6 dollars/lb</code>
   <code>
    34800000/45359237 (approx. 0.76720867240337398) dollar (currency)<br/>
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   <code>
    buttercost = 3.69 dollars/lb</code>
   <code>
    0.26032183918790344732 dollar (currency)
   </code>
  </p>

  <p>
   An important thing to note is that you specify the units of measure in each
   Frink calculation, and Frink automatically does the right thing with them.
   It contains a large <a href="https://amontalenti.com/frinkdata/units.txt" target="_blank">data
   file</a> of physical quantities, freeing you from having to look them up,
   and freeing you to make effortless calculations without getting bogged down
   in the mechanics.
  </p>

  <p>
   Note that in the above calculations, Frink already knows about units of
   measure such as dollars, gallons, pounds, grams, and allows you to
   transparently mix those units of measure in calculations.  For example, in
   the cheese calculations, the cost was specified in dollars per pound, while
   the cheese was weighed and had its mass specified in grams.  Nevertheless,
   you can transparently multiply these and Frink helps ensure the results
   come out right.

  <h2><a name="Day2">Day 2 - Cabbage Burgers:  My Secret Weapon</a></h2>
  <p>
   I actually started preparing for this experiment a few days in advance, and
   readied my secret weapon: <b>Cabbage Burgers!</b> These are also variously
   known as &#34;Krautburgers&#34; (although that gives the incorrect impression that
   there&#39;s sauerkraut inside; it&#39;s just cooked unfermented cabbage,) or known
   as &#34;Cabbage Rolls&#34; or &#34;Runza&#34; or &#34;The Best Food You Can Prepare in Advance
   and Freeze.&#34;  They&#39;re a bun filled with cabbage, onions, and ground beef.
   They&#39;re delicious, nutritious, filling, inexpensive, and they freeze and
   microwave incredibly well, so you can make a giant batch and have cheap
   food ready in minutes!
  </p>

  <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/krautburgers1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/krautburgers640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480"/></a>

  <p>
   The previous weekend, I made a gigantic batch of these little delights,
   using 4 pounds of ground chuck, 2 heads of cabbage, 5 onions, 13 cups of
   flour, 13 egg yolks (which left me 13+ egg whites for breakfast for 4 days)
   and a few other ingredients.  It was a huge undertaking, but it produced 61
   delicious krautburgers that went into the freezer and should provide about
   30 meals!  Each krautburger cost, by my estimate, about
   <strike>$0.41,</strike> $0.47 (see <a href="#CabbageRollCost">cabbage roll
   cost update</a>), and two of them make a good meal for only about
   <strike>$0.82</strike> $0.94!  I&#39;ve learned that making a huge batch will
   last for weeks or months, and is as easy as making a smaller batch.
  </p>

  <p>
   Because I&#39;m going to be eating Krautburgers many times over the next 45
   days, I&#39;ll publish the recipe and the cost breakdown later.  <i>Update:</i>
   the recipe was published on <a href="#Day13">day 13</a> and the cost
   breakdown on <a href="#Day16">day 16</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
   To combine my &#34;Reduce Waste&#34; and &#34;Gifts are Free&#34; rules, I ate half of the
   orange that I got in my Christmas stocking (I&#39;ve never cared that much for
   most fruit, and I might have let it go to waste if not for this
   experiment,) and 6 cherries that my aunt canned this year and gave as
   Christmas presents.  These were delicious!  I also ate 1/8 of the pound of
   asparagus I bought for $0.99 / pound.  (Put in microwave-safe ventable
   casserole dish, add 1/4 inch water, put the lid on, open the vent, and
   microwave for 7 minutes.)   Later, I had a bowl of vanilla pudding that I
   made a few days earlier.  A good day of eating, and quite cheap!
  </p>

  <h3>Personal Notes</h3>
  <p>
   I have to admit that I went to bed the previous night feeling rather
   hungry.  I expected this.  The more I eat, the more I <em>need</em> to eat
   to feel satisfied.  The less I eat, the less I <em>need</em> to eat to feel
   satisfied.  My super-scientific hypothesis is that my stomach &#34;shrinks&#34; a
   bit when I don&#39;t eat.  Since I had a semi-fasting day yesterday, I felt
   hungry.  And I found it hard to sleep.  Hope I adjust.
  </p>

  <p>
   It&#39;s weird, but if I go to sleep hungry, I usually wake up <em>not</em>
   feeling hungry.  It was hard not to snack before bed, but I managed to pull
   through.  
  </p>

  <p>
   About my usual eating schedule: I very rarely eat breakfast.  Never have,
   at least since college.  I&#39;m usually not hungry in the morning, I&#39;m always
   grumpy in the morning, (okay, I&#39;m grumpy all day, always) and I&#39;d
   <em>always, always</em> choose sleeping 5 more minutes over spending time
   eating!  I&#39;m usually fine with eating just one meal a day in the evening,
   and maybe a snack later.  Everybody&#39;s schedule and needs are going to be
   different.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day2Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>A very inexpensive day!  $1.48, far below my target!  Planning ahead by
    making a large batch of great krautburgers <em>definitely</em> pays off.  I
    didn&#39;t feel hungry when going to bed, and I could have eaten twice as many
    krautburgers and still made my target!

   </li><li>Krautburgers combine two of the great inexpensive &#34;fillers&#34;:  flour and
    cabbage.  (Another is potatoes.)  There&#39;s not a lot of calories in cabbage,
    but it&#39;s delicious and filling, and figures in a lot of low-cost recipes.

   </li><li>In old prison films, prisoners only get &#34;bread and water&#34; or maybe
    &#34;bread and cheese.&#34;  Should I try this one day?  Can I make bread cheaper
    than I can buy it?
    
   </li><li>I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not addicted to coffee or caffeine any more.  I never
    drank coffee but I used to drink at least 4 caffeinated soft drinks a
    day. A roommate of mine was once quite surprised that a majority of his
    daily costs went to coffee.  If you shop carefully, you can get a can of
    soda for $0.33 or so, or it can be much more if you buy it from a vending
    machine!

   </li><li>It&#39;s not a stated goal of this experiment, but I have a few extra
    pounds of fat around my gut that I don&#39;t mind losing.  I&#39;m down about 2
    pounds already, which isn&#39;t unwelcome.  Should I graph my weight?

   </li><li>I&#39;m probably not at the calorie total I need to be sustaining
    long-term.

  <h2><a name="Day3">Day 3 - Egg Salad and Surprise Salmon</a></h2>
  <h3><a name="EggSaladSandwiches">Egg Salad Sandwiches</a></h3>
  <p>
   Egg salad sandwiches are one of my favorite sandwiches ever—they&#39;re
   rich and luxurious and filling.  I always considered them to be rather
   expensive and difficult, but they&#39;re quite the opposite.  They&#39;re
   especially cheap if you have cheap eggs (Albertson&#39;s had a dozen eggs for
   $0.99, which is considerably cheaper than the average $2.19/dozen.)  And if
   you have eggs that are already hard-boiled, as I did, it&#39;s even easier.
  </p>

  <p>
   (I didn&#39;t actually boil the eggs, though.  I steamed them in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/West-Bend-TEM500W-Muffin-Toaster/dp/B008YNFB3Q/" target="_blank">Breakfast Machine</a>, which I love.  It&#39;s a toaster that
   can also cook 1 to 4 eggs, either poached/steamed, soft-boiled, or
   hard-boiled.  (There&#39;s also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/West-Bend-TEM4500W-Muffin-Toaster/dp/B008LTIYN2/" target="_blank">4-slice, 8 egg model</a>.)  Fill it with the appropriate
   amount of water (it comes with a cup marked with the right amounts of water
   for hard, medium, soft, and poached eggs,) and push the button, and you have
   perfectly-cooked eggs. This is good because I&#39;ve never been good at getting
   eggs cooked just right; I live at more than a mile above sea level, and
   water boils at the lower temperature of 204°F (95°C), so none of
   the &#34;never fail&#34; egg-boiling recipes you hear ever work right for me.  A
   &#34;3-minute egg&#34; is still basically uncooked.)
  </p>

  <p>
   I made egg salad by mashing 3 hard-boiled eggs with 80 grams of mayonnaise,
   a tiny squirt of mustard, and some salt and pepper.  That&#39;s it!  I should
   note most strongly that <em>if you put anything else (like celery) into
   your egg salad, you are a terrible monster.</em> Also, egg salad is best on
   plain old soft cheap white bread.  (There&#39;s also nothing more elegant and
   delicate for your afternoon tea than an egg salad sandwich with the crusts
   cut off!)
  </p>

  <p>
   Each sandwich only used about 3/4 of an egg, (about $.06 at my good egg
   prices,) $0.08 of mayonnaise, and $0.10 of plain old white bread, for a
   total of $0.24 per sandwich.  I had one and a half sandwiches, a few chips
   that I still had open (I weighed them to see how much they would cost) and
   felt like a king.
  </p>

  <p>
   (By the way, I saw an egg salad sandwich at the grocery store for $4!)
  </p>

  <h3><a name="SurpriseSalmon">Surprise Salmon</a></h3>
  <p>
   Today, I went shopping at Albertson&#39;s, with a carefully-selected shopping
   list based on their weekly advertisement.  Since it&#39;s a Friday during Lent,
   I planned on making a fish dish.  (I&#39;ve never understood how eating fish
   was in any way a sacrifice, though.)  I had an interesting recipe for fish
   chowder (which I&#39;ve never made before,) which sounded filling (it had
   potatoes and milk).  Albertson&#39;s advertised frozen tilapia, swai, and
   pollock on sale for $2.99/lb.  These fish can be somewhat bland, but that&#39;s
   a pretty good price for fish.  This was my plan.
  </p>

  <p>
   However, when I looked at the frozen fish, I saw that they had <em>whole
   frozen pink salmon for $1.99/lb!</em> Salmon is one of my very favorite
   fish, and that is a <em>fantastic</em> price for salmon, which is usually 7
   to 10 dollars per pound, so I made the decision on the spot to buy a whole
   salmon and eat plain salmon instead!  (They had the same deal on whole
   salmon a year ago, and I didn&#39;t buy one, and I was sad for the whole year!)
  </p>

  <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/wholesalmon1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/wholesalmon640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480"/></a>

  <p>
   2.25 pounds of salmon for only $4.48!
  </p>

  <p>
   It was kind of scary, because the fish I picked was rather large (2.25
   pounds) and frozen solid.  I hoped I&#39;d be able to cut it and save portions
   for later.  Luckily, a rough serrated knife sawed through the
   completely-frozen fish quite easily, allowing me to separate it into
   portions for freezing:
  </p>

  <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/cutsalmon1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/cutsalmon640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480"/></a>

  <p>
   I&#39;m not good at butchering whole fish, but a long, thin, flexible knife let
   me remove the backbone and fins without much problem.
  </p>

  <p>
   I prepared a couple of baked potatoes by first microwaving them (using the
   &#34;potato&#34; button) and then brushing them with a bit of olive oil and kosher
   salt and finishing them in a 400°F oven (for crispiness.)
  </p>

  <p>
   While the potatoes were cooking, I brined and thawed the salmon in cold
   water for 30 minutes with some sugar and salt.  You know sometimes when you
   cook salmon and the yellow, buttery-looking albumin comes out in blobs on
   the surface of the fish?  It doesn&#39;t look great, but brining prevents the
   albumin from leaking out and adds flavor to the fish.  This is extremely
   important when smoking salmon, too!
  </p>

  <p>
   Since the oven was not at the right temperature for cooking salmon (I
   either bake it low and slow or under a hot broiler,) I decided to pan-fry
   the salmon using a technique that I learned from Eric Ripert that gives you
   super-crispy, yummy skin.  You dry the skin very well, and sprinkle the skin
   with a bit of salt, pepper and a fine dusting of Wondra flour.  Then
   pan-fry, skin down, with a little bit of oil and butter, pressing the fish
   down, cooking for 80% of the time on the skin side, and turning over
   briefly to finish.
  </p>

  <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/donesalmon1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/donesalmon640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480"/></a>
  
  <p>
   As you can hopefully see, the salmon skin was gorgeous and crisp.  I had
   salmon, 2 baked potatoes (with butter and sour cream, not pictured,)
   asparagus, and a slice of lemon.  The 6.25 ounce portion of salmon itself
   only cost $0.77!  Amazing!  Oh, and that&#39;s free dill from my aunt&#39;s garden
   on top of the salmon!  Note the additional costs below.
  </p>
  
  <h3><a name="Day3Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I checked the weekly supermarket advertisements very carefully for
    sales before shopping, and planned several meals to avoid waste.

   </li><li>The moral of this story is: read the ads, and plan your meals around
    deep discounts.

   </li><li>The moral of this story is: don&#39;t be afraid to adjust your plan based
    on what you see at the store.
    
   </li><li>Much of the hidden costs of cooking salmon and baked potatoes is in the
    olive oil and butter, as I was too lazy to walk 30 feet to grab some plain
    vegetable oil for cooking.  I&#39;ll do better next time.

   </li><li>The butter and sour cream on the baked potatoes are more expensive than
    the potatoes!  I cut back a bit on them, but could cut back more and still
    be happy.  Are there other things that are good on baked potatoes?

   </li><li>The cost for potatoes calculated above is for the potatoes I had left
    over in the pantry.  I bought potatoes much cheaper ($3 / (10 lb)) today,
    so I will do even better in the future on potatoes.

   </li><li>I thought potato chips would be too cost-prohibitive, but a small
    amount of house-brand chips doesn&#39;t cost a lot.  I like my salt!

   </li><li>Whenever you&#39;re cooking baked potatoes, cook a few extra and
    refrigerate them.  This lets you make fried potatoes the next day.  Fried
    potatoes are <em>much</em> quicker and better when the potato is already
    mostly cooked!  If they&#39;re not cooked already, it&#39;s hard to get the inside
    of the potato cooked without overcooking the outsides.

   </li><li>I have to say that Albertson&#39;s advertisements had at least ten times as
    many great deals than the other stores, which made me decide to go there.
    There were far, far more deep deals.  The other grocery stores (King
    Sooper&#39;s and Safeway) didn&#39;t even begin to compete on advertised bargains.
    You&#39;ll be impressed with some of the deals I got in the next days or weeks!

   </li><li>Almost every single thing on my receipt was on deep discount.  The only
    things not on sale were milk and butter.

   </li><li>Margarine is 1/4 the price of butter, but I&#39;m sticking with butter.
    (Partially to avoid trans-fats.)  A bit of vegetable oil for cooking is
    even more cost-effective.

   </li><li>Answering my questions from the other day, big &#34;family-sized&#34; cans of
    tomato soup are actually <em>more</em> expensive per ounce than small
    cans!

   </li><li>I had bought 2 dozen eggs a week ago for the amazing price of
    $0.99/dozen, (they&#39;re normally $2.19/dozen) and I was sad that they were
    running out.  However, I was surprised to see eggs at Albertson&#39;s today
    for the incredible price of $0.50/dozen!  Yes!  I bought 2 dozen.  That&#39;s
    barely more than $0.04 an egg!

   </li><li>Eggs are <em>amazing.</em>  If someone asked you, as an engineer, how
    much you would charge to create an egg in a laboratory, how much would it
    cost?

   </li><li>When buying whole fish, you have to assume some waste from bones and
    fins and such.  There wasn&#39;t too much waste at all, but you have to factor
    this into your costs.  I still feel a little bad that I didn&#39;t try making
    fish stock from the bones and tail.  I will next time.  (Saving stock is
    great for other recipes or the best ramen ever.)

   </li><li>I didn&#39;t eat the salmon tail.  I&#39;ve hosted cajun food parties almost
    every year for the past 20 years.  The first year, I asked the butcher
    to save me salmon tails, which I heard were good breaded and deep-fried.
    They ended up just being all bones and basically inedible.

   have several more portions of salmon in the freezer!

  <h2><a name="Day4">Day 4 - Pork Soft Tacos</a></h2>
  <p>
   How is it possible that one of the most delicious cuts of meat you can buy
   is also one of the most inexpensive?  Nothing is more luxurious than a
   falling-apart-tender pork shoulder with its delicious mix of meat, fat, and
   gelatin.  The only trick is to cook it correctly, and that&#39;s not even a
   trick.  Pork shoulder requires low and slow heat for a long time to become
   tender.  This is where your slow cooker (also known as a crock pot) comes
   in.  A slow cooker is almost fool-proof.  In the morning, you can drop in
   your roast with some onions, seasonings, and liquid, set it to low, and
   come back 9 hours later for meat that&#39;s as tender as any you&#39;ve ever tasted.
  </p>

  <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/porkrub1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/porkrub640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Uncooked pork shoulder with rub"/></a>
  <p>
   <i>I rub you, my delicious pork shoulder.</i>
  </p>
  
  <p>
   And that&#39;s what I did.  In the morning, I took out the crock pot, set it to
   low, put in 3 chopped onions, took a pork shoulder and covered it with my
   <a href="#MakingSpiceRubAndBuyingSpices">homemade spice rub</a>, and set it
   on top of the onions, and added hot water to cover.  I then walked away.
   (Okay, I came back to add water as it warmed up.  More about that tomorrow
   when I discuss the science of meat temperatures.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Nine hours later, the house smelled amazing, the roast was tender, and the
   crock pot was filled to the top with rich, delicious broth.  Let me make a
   very, very important point:
  </p>

  <p>
   <b>Save that broth!</b>
  </p>

  <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/porkbroth1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/porkbroth640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Pork Broth"/></a>
  
  <p>
   I will repeat that:
  </p>
   
  <p>
   <b>Save that broth!</b>  I had 4 quarts of dark, delicious, flavorful pork
   broth into which the fat, gelatin, meat juices, onions, and spices had
   mingled.  You can freeze this broth and make the most amazing ramen you&#39;ve
   ever tasted.  Which I&#39;m going to do soon.
  </p>

  <p>
   The pork shoulder was 3.41 lb at $1.99/lb, and it will make several meals
   of pork tacos.  Shredding the pork for tacos is easy.  Put some of it in a
   bowl, and take two forks and shred it.  It just pulls apart.  The tacos had
   shredded cheese (which I got for the very good price of $2.88/lb,) soft
   flour tortillas, and shredded cabbage.
  </p>
  
  <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/porktacos1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/porktacos640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Completed Pork Tacos"/></a>

  <p>
   It&#39;s a bit difficult to estimate the cost of the pork that went into each
   taco until all the pork is gone (which will take several days.)  Much of
   the original pork&#39;s mass went into the broth in the form of melted fat,
   gelatin, and meat juices, so weighing the final pork isn&#39;t enough to get a
   cost estimate.  I weighed all the other ingredients, though, and estimated
   a final cost of about $0.51 per big yummy taco.  I ate 4 tacos, so the
   estimated total for dinner was $2.04, for a very satisfying and balanced
   meal.
  </p>

  <p>
   The tacos have all your major food groups:  grains, dairy, meat, and
   vegetables.  Nothing more is required!
  </p>

  <p>
   For lunch, I had one and a half egg salad sandwiches and some kimchi, like
   yesterday.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day4Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Next time, make sure to warm up the tortillas, cheese, and cabbage
    before putting the pork in the taco.  It&#39;ll all come out warmer and nicer.

   </li><li>Save a little of the pork broth to reheat tomorrow&#39;s pork shoulder in,
    just as gently as your crock pot cooked it.  Don&#39;t boil or microwave it!

   </li><li>The pork and broth comes out of the crock pot quite hot.  Before I put
    it in the refrigerator or freezer, I put it into a container (a ziploc bag
    for the pork roast and tubs for the broth) and cool them in a cold water
    bath in the sink.  (Add ice to make it even faster.)  This reduces the
    time that the food spends in the so-called &#34;danger zone&#34; between 40°F
    and 140°F where bacteria can grow.  (I&#39;ll write more about food safety
    one of these days.)

   </li><li>Plan your pork and broth usage so that you&#39;re done eating it within 3-4
    days, unless you freeze it.

   </li><li>The cabbage was quite hard.  I&#39;m thinking of salting a bit of the
    cabbage before adding it to the tacos tomorrow.  This rapidly softens the
    cabbage, (and makes it delicious!) as I&#39;ll describe when I describe how to
    make kimchi!

   Wow!  <strike>Very close to my goal, but 5 cents over.</strike>
   <i>Update:</i> The price of pork <a href="#PorkRevision">was recalculated
   after the pork was done, bringing me back under budget.</a> Some of the
   costs that I&#39;ve charged to this meal are actually in the 4 quarts of broth
   that are going to be used in future meals.  Saving the broth effectively
   makes these future meals cheaper or free!  I&#39;m not going to try to do
   &#34;creative bookkeeping&#34; here, but track my costs honestly and
   conservatively.  I consider today a success.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="Day5">Day 5 - Meat Science (and French Toast)</a></h2>
  <p>
   Breakfast/lunch was french toast and fried potatoes.  As I mentioned on <a href="#Day3Thoughts">day 3</a>, whenever you&#39;re baking potatoes, make
   another one or two for fried potatoes the next day.  Fried potatoes are
   <em>much</em> quicker and better when the potato is already mostly cooked!
   If they&#39;re not cooked already, it&#39;s hard to get the inside of the potato
   cooked without overcooking the outsides.  The fried potatoes cost $0.12 for
   about 4 ounces of potatoes.
  </p>

  <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/frenchtoast1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/frenchtoast640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="French Toast"/></a>
  <p>
   French toast is easy, and contains two inexpensive ingredients:  eggs and
   bread.  (And a little milk and sugar.)  It turns out that each slice of
   toast uses 1/2 of an egg, so the total cost per slice was $0.10.  I had two
   slices.  Breakfast/lunch cost $0.32.
  </p>

  <p>
   Dinner was exactly like day 4—more delicious pork tacos!  I believe
   that I greatly overestimated the amount of pork that I used on day 4, so I
   may go back and revise the cost of these meals after all the pork is gone,
   and I can divide the cost of the pork by how many tacos it made.
  </p>

  <p>
   Since I wrote about the pork tacos on <a href="#Day4">day 4,</a> as
   promised, I&#39;m going to drop some meat science on you!

  </p><h3><a name="MeatScience">Meat Science!</a></h3>
  <p>
   A pork shoulder, uncooked, is a rather unruly chunk of meat.  It&#39;s a mix of
   intermingled muscle and fat.  As you may know, whenever muscle connects to
   fat, or muscle connects to bone, there&#39;s some connective tissue (commonly
   known as gristle when not cooked correctly) which is unchewable and
   <em>not</em> good eats.  However, when a pork shoulder is slow-cooked for 9
   or more hours at low temperature, you can eat every single bit of the
   shoulder, and it&#39;s smooth and delicious!  The connective tissue is no
   longer a problem.  What happened to it?
  </p>

  <p>
   The connective tissue is made mostly of collagen, a tough protein.  You can
   think of collagen as a three-stranded rope, which it strongly resembles.
   It&#39;s a helix of three strands wound around each other.  When you cook
   collagen above about 145°F (63 °C), the three strands begin to
   unwind from each other.  Each strand is gelatin.  Gelatin is an interesting
   protein that can hold up to 10 times its mass in water.  However, there&#39;s
   not much water originally in this gelatin strand.  With enough time and
   moisture, these gelatin strands will absorb water from the surrounding
   cooking liquid and muscle fibers (which squeeze out their own moisture as
   they heat up.)  This makes a rich gel that keeps the meat moist and
   delicious.
  </p>

  <p>
   Breaking down collagen into gelatin and making the gelatin absorb water is
   a process that takes both heat and time.  Collagen breaks down into
   gelatin and absorbs water well at temperatures around 174°F
   (79°C), which is the temperature that a good slow cooker on low setting
   should hold.  Collagen will break down and absorb water at even lower
   temperatures, but it takes significantly more time.
  </p>

  <p>
   (My slow cooker gets significantly hotter than this, eventually boiling (at
   the altitude I live, that&#39;s 204°F (95°C)) at the edges even on the
   low setting, so I like to start cooking with just enough water to cover the
   roast, and add more water as it gets too hot (as measured by a probe
   thermometer) eventually filling it to the top so I have lots of good broth.
   Starting with a small amount of water is smart because a crock pot heats
   quite slowly.  (My simple crock pot heats at only 215 watts on low and 335
   watts on high.)  Before your crock pot reaches 140°F (60°C), you are
   in the so-called &#34;danger zone&#34; where bacteria can grow.  You thus want to
   start with hot water to minimize time in the danger zone.)
  </p>

  <p>
   Note:  Collagen also holds muscle fiber to muscle fiber, which is why you
   can shred individual fibers of the pork shoulder apart with a fork after
   breaking down the collagen with long, slow cooking.  This further
   tenderizes the meat, and holds moisture in the gelatin between muscle
   fibers.
  </p>

  <h4>So Why Don&#39;t We Cook All Meat This Way?</h4>
  <p>
   Cooking a pork shoulder at 174°F to 190°F for 9 or more hours makes
   it moist and luxurious.  This is a cut of meat with lots of collagen, which
   turns to gelatin, which holds liquids in the meat and keeps it moist and
   tender.
  </p>

  <p>
   However, if we tried to cook a lean piece of meat (without much connective
   tissue) this way, we would absolutely murder it and turn it into a dry,
   tight brick.  As meat gets much warmer than about 140°F (60°C), the
   muscle fibers and connective tissue contract and squeeze moisture out,
   making the meat very dry.  A piece of lean meat cooked at these
   temperatures for this amount of time would be tough and dry, especially
   because there&#39;s no gelatin to hold 10 times its mass in moisture in the
   meat.
  </p>

  <p>
   (For comparison, beef is a nice medium-rare at 131°F (55°C) and
   lean pork is &#34;done&#34; and no longer pink at 145°F (62.7°C).)
  </p>

  <p>
   &#34;Stew meat&#34; that cooks a long time in stews or chilis is usually something
   like pork shoulder or beef brisket with lots of collagen.  You won&#39;t
   improve your stew by putting in filet mignon or ribeye steak.  But pork
   shoulder or beef brisket are actually made <em>better</em> by long, slow,
   moist cooking at temperatures that would tie leaner meats into tough knots.
  </p>

  <p>
   I&#39;ll write more later about the two major proteins in meat, and why
   breaking one down protein (myosin) is good, and breaking the other protein
   (actin) down is bad, and how you can have the best of both worlds with the
   right cooking technique.  (Hint: it&#39;s called &#34;sous vide&#34;.)
  </p>

  <h3><a name="Day5Thoughts">Thoughts</a></h3>
  <ul>
   <li>I&#39;ll write more later about how surprisingly much energy it takes to
    heat water, which is one of the hardest substances in the universe to
    heat.

   </li><li>I actually ate the French toast without butter nor syrup to save a few
    cents.  The secret to keeping it moist may be to undercook the eggs
    slightly, which is what happened.

   </li><li>I ate the potatoes without Sriracha sauce nor Mae Ploy sweet chili
    sauce, which I usually like on <em>anything</em>.  I&#39;ll have to calculate
    what a small amount of these costs.  These are two sauces that are usually
    surprisingly inexpensive at Asian markets.

   </li><li>Another reason that Sriracha is surprisingly inexpensive is that the
   founder, David Tran, <a href="http://qz.com/132738/the-highly-unusual-company-behind-siracha-the-worlds-coolest-hot-sauce/" target="_blank">is
   unbelievably awesome and just cares about making great hot sauce.</a> Read
   that article and you&#39;ll be a fan too.

   </li><li>Note to self:  Next time I&#39;m at Taco Bell, &#34;liberate&#34; some free
    sauces.  I actually had a ton of sauce packets that I recently threw away
    because some had been creased and started to leak.

  <p>
   Again, I won&#39;t know the pork cost per taco until all the pork is gone, so I
   may revise these figures.  The pork cost for day 4 was almost certainly
   overestimated, and I&#39;m easily back within my budget today.
  </p>

  <p>
  <i>Update:</i> The price of pork <a href="#PorkRevision">was recalculated
    after the pork was done.</a>
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="Day6">Day 6 - The Best Damn Ramen that You&#39;ve Ever Seen</a></h2>
  <p>
   After shoveling heavy snow and breaking ice for almost two hours at very
   cold temperatures, I had 3-inch-long icicles of sweat hanging from my hair,
   and I was ready for a shower and a huge hot bowl of ramen noodles!
  </p>

  <p>
   Luckily, as you may remember from <a href="#Day4">day 4</a> when I made
   Pork Tacos, I saved the delicious broth from the slow cooker, which is the
   secret for the best ramen you&#39;ll ever have:
  </p>
  
  <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/porkbroth1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/porkbroth640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Pork
    Broth"/></a>

  <p>
   That broth paid off.  It&#39;s rich and thick and delicious.  So rich, in fact,
   that I diluted it to half-strength.  The 4 quarts of broth that I saved
   will go quite a long way.
  </p>

  <p>
   The other secret ingredient for making ordinary ramen extraordinary is your
   refrigerator&#39;s friend, <b>Bok Choy</b>!  I hadn&#39;t used Bok Choy much in the
   past, but it&#39;s an incredibly tolerant and long-lasting vegetable.  It will
   stay fresh in your refrigerator for far longer than you&#39;d ever expect.
   Just buy a big head for about $1.00/lb and break off what you need.  (Baby
   bok choy is beautiful and cute, but it costs about 5 times as much in my
   local supermarket.  You may be able to buy it cheaper in Asian
   supermarkets, which may have 10 different types of little bok choys,
   sometimes in huge bags.)
  </p><p>

  <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/bokchoysliced1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/bokchoysliced640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Sliced
     Bok Choy"/></a>

  </p><p>
   Long after cabbage and lettuce and other vegetables have wilted or molded
   in your fridge, the Bok Choy will still be good.  Chop it into pieces, and
   boil it in your broth for about 7-10 minutes.  It maintains a very nice
   crisp texture even if you under- or over-cook it, and it absorbs the flavor
   of the broth, making it quite delicious.  3.2 ounces of bok choy cost
   $0.20.
  </p>

  <p>
   After the bok choy cooked, I boiled a packet of cheap ($0.16)
   chili-flavored ramen in the broth for the usual couple minutes.  I then put
   it in a giant bowl (29 fluid ounces!) and, for an extra bit of flavor and
   protein and richness, I cracked a raw egg ($0.08) into it, which cooked in
   the hot liquid.
  </p>

  <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/ramenwithegg1024x768.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/ramenwithegg640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" alt="Ramen
    with Egg"/></a>

  <p>
   That was unbelievably delicious and rich.  Look at that broth!  That&#39;s
   nothing like your usual ramen-seasoning-packet broth, and there was more
   than twice as much of it!  There was even broth left over after re-filling
   my bowl partway.  More than two pounds of hot, delicious ramen soup in my
   belly made me feel a lot warmer.
  </p>

  <p>
   While I ate my ramen, I watched a Simply Ming episode in which chef Ming
   Tsai makes elaborate, super-expensive ramen with a new Japanese Iron Chef.
   They used A-5 grade Kobe beef, smoked maitake mushrooms, dried scallops,
   mussels, and many more super-expensive ingredients.  I&#39;ll bet I was every
   bit as satisfied with my delicious bowl of ramen that cost about $0.54.
   (For this price I could only buy about 1.5 grams of A-5 kobe beef.  For
   comparison, a U.S. dollar bill has a mass of about 1 gram.)
  </p>

  <p>
   By the way, I forgot to account for the cost of the spice rub that I put on
   the pork shoulder in <a href="#Day4">day 4</a>, which made the broth so
   delicious, so I&#39;ll account for it below.
  </p>

  <h3><a name="MakingSpiceRubAndBuyingSpices">Making Spice Rub and Buying Spices</a></h3>
  <p>
   Tiny little jars of commercial spice rub for cooking meat are incredibly
   expensive (maybe $4 for a 1.75-oz jar) and meat takes a <em>lot</em> of
   rub!  I make my own spice rub with some inexpensive ingredients I have in
   my cupboard.  I usually make a fairly large batch and have some left over,
   because it&#39;s good to sprinkle on anything from meat to fried or baked
   potatoes to vegetables.  The proportions for my spice rub are somewhat
   like:
  </p>

  <h4>Spice Rub (very) approximate recipe</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>3/4 cup brown sugar
   </li><li>1/4 cup chicken bouillon powder
   </li><li>1 tablespooon garlic powder
   </li><li>1/2 tablespoon cumin
   </li><li>1/2 tablespoon black pepper
   </li><li>Every other spice you like including:
    <ul>
     <li>Cayenne pepper
     </li><li>Paprika
     </li><li>Chili Powder
     </li><li>Onion Powder
    </li></ul>
  </li></ul>

  <p>
   Brown sugar is relatively cheap.  A good rule of thumb is that it&#39;s
   $1.00/lb, or about twice as expensive as white sugar.  A cup of brown sugar
   costs $0.50.  I&#39;m going to wildly overestimate the total cost of the big
   batch of rub that I made as $1.50, about half of which went into the broth
   (and I have half left over.)  Since there&#39;s enough broth for about 8 huge
   bowls of ramen, I&#39;ll call it $0.10 in spices per bowl.
  </p>

  <p>
   Dinner was pork tacos again.  I definitely have overestimated how much the
   pork cost, so I&#39;ll revise the above calculations when I&#39;m done.  There&#39;s
   still enough for a few more pork tacos.
  </p>

  <h4><a name="BuyingSpices">Buying Spices</a></h4>
  <p>
   <img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/boullion.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Bouillon"/>
   By the way, a good way to buy spices more inexpensively is to go to what
   Walmart calls the &#34;Hispanic Foods&#34; aisle.  This is especially true for
   bouillon powder.  Walmart sells a giant jug that they call &#34;Knorr Hispanic
   Chicken Granulated Bouillon, 35.3 oz&#34; for $4.98.  This is a fraction of the
   cost of bouillon in the spice aisle.  I use this in a <em>lot</em> of
   recipes, and it lasts me many months.

  </p>

  <p>
   <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/cumin.jpg"><img src="https://amontalenti.com/2025/01/05/links/cumin150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" alt="Cumin"/></a>
   The &#34;Hispanic Foods&#34; aisle of your grocery store may also contain other
   spices <em>much</em> cheaper.  I usually get cumin, chili powders, and
   other spices in this aisle, usually under the &#34;Órale!&#34; brand.  These
   spices come in bags instead of jars, and cost about 1/3 what they do a
   couple aisles away.
   <br clear="LEFT"/>
  </p>

  <p>
   Another great place to buy inexpensive spices in bulk is Indian markets.
   These often have bags of spices like cardamom, cumin, coriander, cinnamon,
   mustard seeds, sesame seeds, and a wide variety of chili powders for
   drastically lower prices than you can find them elsewhere.

   <li>Since the cabbage for the pork tacos has been somewhat hard, I salted
    some cabbage and let it stand in the fridge for several hours.  This

  <h2><a name="Day7">Day 7 - Colcannon and Pork Pancakes</a></h2>
  <p>
   Breakfast was a bowl of quick oatmeal.  I can count on one hand the number
   of times I&#39;ve eaten oatmeal in my life, but it was very good (once you
   add brown sugar.)  Total cost:  $0.16.
  </p>

  <p>
   Containers are starting to sprout strange new labels:

  <p>
   That gigantic container cost less than a much smaller can of Quaker brand
   oats. ($2.99)
  </p>

  <p>
   For lunch, I had a hot dog on a bun.  Unfortunately, the purchase of these
   hot dogs (Oscar Meyer Classic Bun-Length, my favorite) predated this
   experiment, so they weren&#39;t the most cost-effective.  I have newer hot dogs
   that cost 1/3 the price.  A hot dog was $0.32, and a bun was $0.16, for a
   total of $0.48 for a single hot dog.  (I have cheaper hot dogs that I could
   eat on bread for a total $0.15, less than 1/3 the price.)  However, my
   rules for this experiment are that anything I have to throw away, I have to
   charge myself for, so chow down, wide load.

  <h3><a name="Colcannon">Colcannon</a></h3>
  <p>
   It&#39;s sort of funny how upset I get when I see something in an advertisement
   that&#39;s much cheaper than I just paid for it.  For example, last week I
   bought 10 pounds of potatoes for $2.99, which I thought was a pretty good
   deal.  But yesterday I saw the same bag at the same store for $0.99!  That
   made me sad.  I started thinking, &#34;well, I could still eat 8.3 pounds of
   potatoes a day at the old price.  Or <em>25 pounds</em> a day at the new
   price.&#34;  At this moment, I became enlightened.  If I were ever hungry, I
   could eat a bunch of potatoes.  The only thing I&#39;d have to be wary of is
   spending too much money on stuff like butter, sour cream, or sauce (Mae
   Ploy sweet chili sauce is really good on boiled potatoes!)

   So how could I make a bunch of ready-to-eat, delicious long-lasting
   potatoes?  The answer came from a recipe I&#39;ve made for many a St. Patrick&#39;s
   Day party: <b>Colcannon.</b>
  </p>

  <p>
   Colcannon is an Irish dish (in Irish Gaelic, <i>cál ceannann</i>, meaning
   &#34;white-headed cabbage&#34;,) made with mashed potatoes mixed with cabbage.
   Other variations use kale, leeks, onions, and scallions, in addition to
   possibly ham or bacon.

   Since a stick of butter costs around $1.00, I decided to try to use the
   cabbage to keep the mashed potatoes moist, and eliminate butter or cream
   entirely.  I boiled/steamed some cabbage with water and salt, and saved the
   cabbage water.  This got added to 3.5 pounds of mashed potatoes.  The
   result was still far too dry, so I added 2 cups of milk (which was probably
   a bit too much.)  This made 4.5 pounds of finished Colcannon, all for the
   price of $1.96!  I&#39;ll have this ready to eat with any meal.
