  <p>The Wait Until 8th pledge empowers parents to rally together to delay giving children a smartphone until at least 8th grade.  By banding together, this will decrease the pressure felt by kids and parents alike over the kids having a smartphone. </p><p>Smartphones are distracting and potentially dangerous for children yet are widespread in elementary and middle school because of unrealistic social pressure and expectations to have one.</p><p>These devices are quickly changing childhood for children. Playing outdoors, spending time with friends, reading books and hanging out with family is happening a lot less to make room for hours of snap chatting, instagramming, and catching up on You Tube.</p><p>Parents feel powerless in this uphill battle and need community support to help delay the ever-evolving presence of the smartphone in the classroom, social arena and family dinner table. Let’s band together to wait until at least eighth grade before children are allowed to have a smartphone. </p><p>The Wait Until 8th pledge is encouraging parents to delay the smartphone. If you need to get in touch before 8th grade, we have some great basic phones and watches <a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/devices" target="_blank">featured here</a>. If you would like your child to have a basic phone that just calls and texts or a two-way calling watch, you still can sign the pledge! Theses basic options avoid many of the distractions and dangers of the smartphone. </p><p>Childhood is too short to waste on a smartphone. Take the <a href="https://www.waituntil8th.org/take-the-pledge">pledge</a> today! </p>
