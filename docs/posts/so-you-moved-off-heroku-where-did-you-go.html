    <h1>Ask HN: So you moved off Heroku, where did you go?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>So you moved your apps off Heroku, where did you go to and how has it worked out?</p><p>Particularly interested in:</p><p>1. How much work it took to move apps (be honest)</p><p>2. How much experience you had at the time of the migration - e.g. on one extreme your entire devops experience may consist of just Heroku (that&#39;s me) or on the other extreme you may be a k8s guru (this helps others gauge how they&#39;ll go)</p><p>3. How valuable were your learnings? E.g. replacing Heroku with an IAAS instead of another PAAS might take longer but give more fundamental learnings, and hence be worth it for some</p><p>4. Cost comparison</p><p>5. Summary/description of your apps (e.g. 20 tiny apps with a few hits per month, 5 medium with ~20k hits per month, 2 large with 1-2m hits per month type thing). Please give language/framework.</p><p>6. Anything else you want to add</p></div></div></div>
