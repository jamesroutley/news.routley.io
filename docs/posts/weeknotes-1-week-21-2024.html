    <ul>
<li>I haven&#39;t done weeknotes (or blogging of any kind tbh) in a while so enjoying being back, even as I vigorously sort the wheat from the chaff of my week. What can I even talk about? Lots of &#34;who gave me this microphone?&#34; type feelings popping up but I&#39;m rolling with it.</li>
<li>My <a href="https://olu.online/now">/now</a> page is up! Go there if you want to know what I&#39;m up to but don&#39;t want to reach out and strike up a conversation, god forbid.</li>
<li>Doing Substack and YouTube again because I want more online community and joining other people&#39;s only seems to go so far. Please reach out and tell me about all the great communities I&#39;m missing of course, but this is my current plan anyway.</li>
<li>Writing video essays is hard; I knew this on one level and not on another. Feeling a lot of resistance to writing my current script but hoping getting all the rest of the writing chugging along will help a lot.</li>
<li>Journaling more; I was doing morning pages but this week morning&#39;s have been hard as hell. Been going for 22 days I think, which hasn&#39;t felt stressful surprisingly, I think my longest <a href="https://new.750words.com">750 words</a> streak is about a month, so hoping to go for longer this time!</li>
<li>Not reading as much as I&#39;d like in the &#34;longform and not on a website/newsletter&#34; category, but I&#39;m examining not just doing things fro their intrinsic virtue anyway. Like am I doing something cos I enjoy it? Cos it serves me in some way? Or just because it distracts me from the pull of the grave/TikTok doomscrolling for hours?</li>
<li>Enjoying singing and music more too; I&#39;ve signed up for a songwriting course I&#39;m really looking forward to.</li>
<li>Oh, and learning more computer science stuff; equal parts awed, interested and intimidated.</li>
</ul>
