    <h1>Twenty years of my work with Arm architecture</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Twenty years ago I bought Sharp Zaurus <span>SL</span>-5500 Linux <span>PDA</span>. With StrongARM <span>SA1110</span>
inside. And I had no idea how it will end…</p>
<!--MORE-->

<h3>Hobby</h3>
<p>At first it was a hobby. Finding what I can do with it (compared to previous
devices running PalmOS) was fun. SharpROM, OpenZaurus 3.2, OpenZaurus 3.3-pre1
etc. New apps, taskbar plugins…</p>
<p>Then I wanted to build something. Found an OpenZaurus toolchain, tried it and
went for help. And got “forget this toolchain, we have a new toy: OpenEmbedded”.</p>
<p>And I sunk in…</p>
<p>Took me some time to get familiar with that (lot of n00b questions asked). Then
many attempts to get a bootable image. Turned out that my image was one of first
properly booting on a <span>SL</span>-5500 device. So I got write access to OpenEmbedded with
“now you can merge all of it” message.</p>
<h4>OpenZaurus</h4>
<p>I spent three years working on OpenZaurus distribution. In my free time. Started
as a user, went through being developer and 
<a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2006/03/18/openzaurus-354-released/">ended as a release manager</a>. Through
those years I moved from my <span>SL</span>-5500 to the c760 (donated by user). Had several
other Zaurus models on my desk in meantime.</p>
<p>Those were interesting years. I learnt a lot about structure of Linux
filesystem, how packaging works, all those differences between build-time and
install-time dependencies, sorting out upgrades etc. And how to cooperate with
other developers and users. Also how to avoid those who deserve to be ignored.</p>
<h3>Embedded Linux developer</h3>
<p>At one moment working with Arm architecture stopped being hobby and became daily work.</p>
<p>Matthew Allum from OpenedHand proposed me a full time contract so 
<a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2006/12/15/job-change/">I left my daily job</a> (as a <span>PHP</span> programmer) and started
working on Poky Linux and its version of OpenEmbedded.</p>
<p>New devices, new interesting challenges, new co-workers and customers. Proper
development boards (those big ones with lot of interesting connectors for even
more expensive equipment), prototypes of misc devices…</p>
<p>After OpenedHand there were other companies interested in my services. Bug Labs
with their Java based system on top of Poky Linux, Vernier with school palmtops
and others. Still embedded Linux.</p>
<h3>Invited speaker</h3>
<p>My first conference was <span>FOSDEM</span> 2007. And then were several other ones but I was
an attendee rather than speaker.</p>
<p>2009 changed it — Andrea Gallo from <span>ST</span>-Ericsson invited me to give a talk at 
<a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2009/10/19/st-ericsson-community-workshop-2009/">their workshop</a> in
Grenoble. My presentation was about supporting their developer board <span>NHK</span>-15 in
Poky Linux and OpenEmbedded.</p>
<p>Next day was <a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2009/10/27/elc-e-2009/"><abbr title="Embedded Linux Conference Europe"><span>ELCE</span></abbr> where I gave a talk</a> called “Hacking
with OpenEmbedded”. It was also conference where I met Leif Lindholm and Jon
Masters for the first time.</p>
<h3>Linaro</h3>
<p>2010 came, I had over three years of paid embedded Linux work behind me.
<a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2010/04/06/another-job-change/">Canonical asked and we signed papers.</a>
Then another papers and I became one of the first 20 people working at Linaro.
To work on improving Arm support in Linux.</p>
<p>It was time when working with Arm meant embedded work, just using main
distributions instead of embedded ones. All those device specific kernels,
images etc.</p>
<p>I did cross compilation toolchains for Debian/Ubuntu, AArch64 bring up using
OpenEmbedded and several other tasks.</p>
<h3>Red Hat</h3>
<p>In 2013 I ended my contract with Canonical, 
<a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2013/05/31/my-time-at-linaro-is-over/">left Linaro</a>
and <a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2013/08/01/new-job-senior-software-engineer-red-hat/">joined Red Hat</a>.
And met the other side of Arm world.</p>
<p>I was not doing developer boards or <span>SBC</span> systems. The project was to get Red Hat
Enterprise Linux distribution running on 64-bit Arm servers. Before they even existed…</p>
<p>It was a fun time. Native builds in very slow system emulators took hours/days.
Prototype servers were faster but also very unstable.</p>
<p>Anyway, we delivered. 
<a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2015/11/20/red-hat-enterprise-linux-server-for-arm-7-2-development-preview-released/"><span>RHEL</span> 7.2 had AArch64 support.</a>
Countless packages got fixed both in <span>RHEL</span> and Fedora.</p>
<h3>Linaro again</h3>
<p>In 2016 <a href="https://marcin.juszkiewicz.com.pl/2016/04/08/back-linaro-org/">I joined Linaro again</a>
(this time as Red Hat engineer). To work on Arm servers. For data centers and clouds.</p>
<p>Virtualization, OpenStack, Big Data, emulation of Arm servers etc.</p>
<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>There were many people who helped me on this journey.</p>
<p>First of all Anna Wagner-Juszkiewicz — without her patience and forcing me to
create my own company I would not go that far.</p>
<p>Then OpenEmbedded team members:</p>
<ul>
<li>Philip Balister</li>
<li>Phil Blundell</li>
<li>Florian Boor</li>
<li>Holger Freyther</li>
<li>Koen Kooi</li>
<li>Christopher Larson</li>
<li>Mickey Lauer</li>
<li>Richard Purdie</li>
<li>Holger Schurig</li>
<li>and countless contributors</li>
</ul>
<p>Some work changes related people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cliff Brake (my first freelance <span>OE</span> jobs)</li>
<li>Tim Bird (<span>CELF</span> was my first customer)</li>
<li>Matthew Allum (full time contract so I left web development)</li>
<li>Christian Reis (Canonical/Linaro job)</li>
<li>Jon Masters (“come, work at Red Hat with us”)</li>
</ul>
<p>Linaro folks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fathi Boudra</li>
<li>Andrea Gallo</li>
<li>Gema Gomez</li>
<li>Lee Jones</li>
<li>Leif Lindholm</li>
<li>Sahaj Sarup</li>
<li>Ebba Simpson</li>
<li>Riku Voipio</li>
<li>Linus Walleij</li>
<li>Wookey</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course I am unable to list everyone. During those twenty years I met many
people, some became friends, some became adversaries. There are faces/names I
remember (and more of those I should remember). And there are people who
recognize me when I do not recognize them (sorry folks).</p>
<h3>Hall of fame shelf</h3>
<p>There is a plan to frame several devices from my past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharp Zaurus <span>SL</span>-5500 (from which all that started)</li>
<li>Atmel <span>AT91SAM9263EK</span> (first developer board I owned)</li>
<li>Applied Micro Mustang (first AArch64 server)</li>
</ul>
<p>And who knows, maybe some other hardware but first would need to get it. Some
already got recycled, some had to be destroyed.</p>
<h3>Plans for next years?</h3>
<p>I plan to continue working on Arm architecture. It brings me fun still.</p>
<p>And who knows, maybe one day some standards compliant AArch64 based system will
replace my x86-64 desktop. All those <span>UEFI</span>, <span>ACPI</span>, <span>SBSA</span>, <span>SBBR</span>, SystemReady
buzzwords in working piece of hardware. Just without spending thousands of €€€
for it.</p>
