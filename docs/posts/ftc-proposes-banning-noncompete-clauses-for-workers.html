Noncompete clauses, which typically bar employees from joining a competitor for a period after they quit, affect nearly one in five American workers, according to the agency. Long associated with higher-paid managers, the clauses have also been imposed on lower-wage workers who lack access to trade secrets, strategic plans and other reasons that could be cited for hampering job switchers,<strong data-type="emphasis"> </strong>the agency says<strong data-type="emphasis">. </strong></p></section></div></article></div>
