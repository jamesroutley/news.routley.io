    <h1>Mechanical Watch: Exploded View</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>
        In May 2022, someone posted to Hacker News <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/">Bartosz
          Ciechanowski&#39;s
          blog post</a>
        explaining how mechanical watch movements work. Since then, his blog has
        been my absolute favorite corner of the Internet. His posts are not just
        well written and easy to follow, the accompanying interactive
        illustrations are magnificent.

        I figured that surely, someone has had this idea and built it before. On
        eBay you&#39;ll find cubes of resin embedding various random components from
        mechanical watches, but they are typically sold as &#34;steampunk art&#34; and
        bear little resemblance to the proper assembly of a mechanical watch
        movement. Sometimes, you&#39;ll find resin castings showing every component
        of a movement spread out in a plane like a buffet---very cool, but not
        what I&#39;m looking for. Despite my best efforts, I haven&#39;t found anyone
        who makes what I&#39;m after, and I have a sneaking suspicion as to why that
        is.

        Building an exploded view of a mechanical watch movement is undoubtedly
        very fiddly work and requires working knowledge about how a mechanical
        watch is assembled. People with that skillset are called watchmakers.
        <i>Maker</i>, not &#34;destroyer for the sake of art&#34;. I guess it falls to
        me, then, to give this project an honest shot.
      </p>

    <p>
        Here comes my favorite part: jumping head-first into a project requiring
        a set of skills I don&#39;t even know exist, let alone possess, following a
        process that develops as the project evolves. So how would one go
        about building a real-life exploded view of a mechanical watch movement?

        The model I&#39;m planning to build must stand up to being handled, which
        means it must be solid. In turn, that probably means that I need to cast
        my components in clear epoxy resin. My first idea was to build the
        exploded model up, layer by layer, letting the resin cure between each
        layer. To save time, I experimented with clear resin that cures when
        exposed to UV light. There are several reasons why this did not work:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            <p>The resin I purchased ended up with a heavy yellow tint after
              curing.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>My puny UV flashlight took forever to cure a pour even 1 mm
              deep.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The seams between layers are very visible.</p>
          </li>
        
      </ol>
      <p>
        The first two problems can probably be solved by throwing money at the
        problem, but the last issue seems to be a problem with varying indices
        of refraction throughout my casting. The resin art community is
        well-aware of this problem, and the suggested solution is to pour the
        next layer of resin before the previous layer has fully cured. This
        supposedly helps the two layers fuse, and should make the transition
        between layers much less pronounced. Unfortunately, UV resin seems to
        cure from the outside in, meaning I needed to use &#34;regular&#34; two-part
        epoxy instead.

    <p>
        It took a while to accept that the only hope I had was to cast the
        entire model at once. This is difficult because I need to somehow
        suspend each tiny component in a way that is robust enough for me to
        pour resin all over it and then pull out any air bubbles.

    <p>
        At this point I&#39;ve tried a number of different epoxy resins claiming to
        cure crystal clear. As far as I can tell, they all turn out appreciably
        clear. Their main differences are viscosity, cure time and how much air
        they trap when mixing. Some resins claim to expel bubbles when curing.
        They manage this to some extent, but to get completely clear castings
        you either need a vacuum chamber to pull out all the air from your cast,
        or a pressure chamber to completely squash any pockets of air. I went
        for a vacuum pump because it&#39;s a fun thing to have around (boiling water
        at room temperature doesn&#39;t get old). Another benefit of the vacuum pump
        is that you don&#39;t need to leave your cast in the chamber for the entire
        cure time. My castings have a lot of voids that love to trap air, and
        the vacuum chamber does a good job of pulling out the trapped air.

        My first somewhat promising cast was in a borosilicate class cylinder. I
        won&#39;t dwell on the looks of this, because I mostly wanted to experiment
        and answer a few burning questions with this prototype:
      </p><dl>
        <dt><b>Q:</b> How visible is the fishing line in the final result?</dt>
        <dd><b>A:</b> Not very! It&#39;s visible in the right light, but I don&#39;t
          think I&#39;m able to do any better.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Q:</b> Does CA glue interfere with the resin in any way?</dt>
        <dd>
          <b>A:</b> Most resin datasheets say that CA glue can interfere with
          the resin&#39;s curing process, but I can&#39;t tell from this test.
        </dd>
        <dt><b>Q:</b> Does casting in a cylinder make sense?</dt>
        <dd>
          <b>A:</b> Definitely not. Light refracts on the curved cylinder
          surface making it difficult to understand the geometry inside,
          defeating the purpose of the model. Cast in a cube.
        </dd>
      </dl><p>
      A week or so later, the cylinder shattered. Resin shrinks as it cures. On
      to the next prototype!

      <p>
        At this point I have settled on a somewhat structured process.

      </p><h3>Disassemble and clean</h3><p>
      Start with a clean, disassembled movement. For instructions on how to
      properly disassemble and clean a watch movement, I highly recomment <a href="https://www.watchfix.com/">Mark
        Lovick&#39;s Watch Repair Course</a>.
      Assemble the train of wheels with their bridges and seize them by
      depositing small amounts of CA glue on the pinions. Just like with the
      watchmaker&#39;s oil, a sewing needle with a flat spot is perfect for
      picking up a small droplet of CA glue and depositing it where it&#39;s
      needed. Capillary action wicks it between the components. Less is more
      when it comes to CA glue: the bond between surfaces is stronger when no
      excess is used, and the cure time is around 30 seconds even without the
      use of an activator.

    <div>
      <p>
        The third iteration incorporated the scissor lift lab jack into the
        process which, together with helping hands, allowed for much greater
        precision in bringing components together true and square. I&#39;m also
        committing another watchmaking sin by placing a small magnet in the jaws
        of my self-closing tweezers to gently hold tiny screws. This allows me
        to lower a screw into its target drop of CA glue and simply lift the
        tweezers once the glue has set. This is a much more reliable method than
        trying to hold onto a sub-millimeter screw with self-closing tweezers
        whose gripping force I have little control over. Magnets are sinful in
        this case because magnetism can cause all sorts of timing issues in
        mechanical watch movements, but that&#39;s obviously not an issue in my
        case.

    <div>
      <p>
        At this point I figured I was ready to tackle the final boss of this
        project: the ETA 2824 wristwatch movement that we&#39;ve all seen in <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/">Bartosz Ciechanowski&#39;s
        blog post</a>. Well, I&#39;ll tackle the Chinese PT5000 clone movement
        instead, because I can&#39;t justify spending €300 on a genuine movement
        only to ensure it will never run again.

      </div>
      <p>
        This movement arrived from China in good working order---I was actually
        suprised at its performance out of the box. It ran with good amplitude
        and little positional variance between horizontal and vertical
        positions. I became less and less impressed as I disassembled the
        movement prior to cleaning, though, because it was absolutely drenched
        in oil. Many of the bridges had sharp burrs that broke off during
        cleaning. Nothing was broken though. All in all, these movements really
        need a proper service before putting them to service. That&#39;s not an
        issue here though.

        Prototype #4 has a couple flaws which I&#39;d like to fix before calling
        this project done. The process of assembling the model is more or less
        nailed down: I just need to find a way to seal any painted surface
        before casting, as well as try to remember that my vacuum chamber has
        limited volume. I bought another PT5000, this time in a complete watch
        with case and a metal band, and started experimenting with sealing the
        painted surfaces. Here&#39;s what didn&#39;t work:
      </p><ul>
        <li>CA glue dissolves paint just as readily as epoxy resin. It might
          work on simple paint-jobs like the chapter indices and the hands, but
          the date ring has crisp lines (the numbers) which I need to
          preserve.</li>
        <li>UV curable CA glue didn&#39;t cure on top of the paint. No idea why.</li>
        <li>Same with UV curable epoxy resin.</li>
      </ul><p>
      Clear spray lacquer from the hardware store worked well and didn&#39;t
      dissolve the paint. It did turn yellow as you&#39;ll see in the final casting,
      but I&#39;m okay with that. I also built a better jig to cut the fishing line
      into equal lengths with square ends. It&#39;s a bit janky but worked very
      well.
