<p><strong>Q1.</strong> Did you <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2025/02/19/microsoft-unveils-majorana-1-the-worlds-first-quantum-processor-powered-by-topological-qubits/">see</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00527-z">Microsoft’s</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/19/technology/microsoft-quantum-computing-topological-qubit.html">announcement</a>?</p>



<p><strong>Q2.</strong> What <em>is</em> a topological qubit?</p>



<p><strong>Q3.</strong> Then why do people care about topological qubits?</p>



<p><strong>Q4.</strong> Did Microsoft create the first topological qubit?</p>



<p><strong>Q5.</strong> Didn’t Microsoft claim the experimental creation of Majorana zero modes—a building block of topological qubits—back in 2018, and didn’t they then need to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/majorana-microsoft-backed-quantum-computer-research-retracted">retract</a> that claim?</p>



<p><strong>Q6.</strong> Is this a big deal?</p>



<p><strong>Q7.</strong> Is this useful?</p>



<p><strong>Q8.</strong> Does this announcement vindicate topological qubits as the way forward for quantum computing?</p>



<p><strong>Q9.</strong> Are there other major experimental efforts to build topological qubits?</p>



<p><strong>Q10.</strong> Is Microsoft now on track to scale to a million topological qubits in the next few years?</p>

	After two decades of mostly-open comments, in July 2024 <i>Shtetl-Optimized</i> transitioned to the following policy:
	
</p><p>All comments are treated, by default, as personal missives to me, Scott Aaronson---with no expectation either that they&#39;ll appear on the blog or that I&#39;ll reply to them.

</p><p>At my leisure and discretion, and in consultation with the <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6576"><i>Shtetl-Optimized</i> Committee of Guardians</a>, I&#39;ll put on the blog a curated selection of comments that I judge to be particularly interesting or to move the topic forward, and I&#39;ll do my best to answer those.  But it will be more like Letters to the Editor.  Anyone who feels unjustly censored is welcome to the rest of the Internet.
