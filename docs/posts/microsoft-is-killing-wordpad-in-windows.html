    <h1>Microsoft is killing WordPad in Windows</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Microsoft announced today that it will deprecate WordPad with a future Windows update as it&#39;s no longer under active development, though the company did not specify the precise timing of this change.</p>
<p>WordPad is a basic text-editing application that allows users to create and edit documents with formatted text and include images and links to other files.</p>
<p>It is automatically installed on Windows systems starting in 1995 since Windows 95 was released, providing users with a basic word processor and document editor integrated into the operating system.</p>
<p>The company now suggests the Microsoft Word app as a replacement for WordPad users and Notepad for those who don&#39;t need rich text support.</p>
<p>&#34;WordPad is no longer being updated and will be removed in a future release of Windows,&#34; Microsoft <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">revealed today</a>.</p>
<p>&#34;We recommend Microsoft Word for rich text documents like .doc and .rtf and Windows Notepad for plain text documents like .txt.&#34;</p>
<p>This doesn&#39;t come as a surprise, given that the program has been <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/notepad-and-paint-become-optional-features-in-windows-10/" target="_blank">an optional Windows feature</a> since the Windows 10 Insider Build 19551 release in February 2020.</p>
<p>Even though it&#39;s still being installed by default on all Windows systems, it made it possible to uninstall it using the &#39;Optional features&#39; control panel.</p>
<p>While not tagged by Redmond as the reason for discontinuing WordPad, earlier this year, the Qbot malware operation also started infecting computers and evading detection by <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qbot-malware-abuses-windows-wordpad-exe-to-infect-devices/" target="_blank">abusing a DLL hijacking flaw in the Windows 10 WordPad app</a>.</p>
<h2>Paint moved on the Microsoft Store, Cortana slowly being killed off</h2>
<p>Five years ago, Microsoft also <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-to-remove-classic-paint-app-from-windows-10-this-fall/" target="_blank">announced</a> that the classic Windows Paint application would be deprecated and removed with the release of the Windows 10 Fall Creator&#39;s Update in July 2017.</p>
<p>However, following an outpour of love for the app, Redmond <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-not-giving-up-on-classic-windows-paint-yet/" target="_blank">decided not to completely kill it</a>, instead making it available through the Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>If enough people ask for it, maybe Microsoft will also move WordPad to its app store so that it remains available as a less feature-rich replacement to Microsoft Office and similar software.</p>
<p>The company also officially began <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-kills-cortana-in-windows-11-preview-long-live-ai/" target="_blank">killing off the Cortana voice-based assistant</a> in Windows 11 Canary preview builds released in early August 2023.</p>
<p>The app&#39;s spot as a Windows digital assistant has already been filled by the AI-powered <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/windows-copilot-your-new-ai-assistant-for-windows-11/" target="_blank">Windows Copilot</a> unveiled during this year&#39;s Build conference.</p>
