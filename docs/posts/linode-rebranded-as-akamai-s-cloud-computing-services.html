    <h1>Linode rebranded as Akamai’s cloud computing services</h1>

<p>Since Akamai’s acquisition of Linode in early 2022, we’ve been hard at work to bring the platforms together under one roof. With the announcement of <a href="https://www.akamai.com/newsroom/press-release/akamai-unveils-akamai-connected-cloud-and-new-cloud-computing-services">Akamai Connected Cloud</a>, Linode is now fully integrated into the Akamai brand. Going forward, Linode’s services will be referred to as Akamai’s cloud computing services.</p>



<p><strong>What is Akamai Connected Cloud?</strong></p>



<p>Akamai Connected Cloud is a massively distributed edge and cloud platform for cloud computing, security, and content delivery. Akamai’s cloud computing services include the essential compute, storage, networking, database, and container management cloud services required to build, deploy, and secure applications and workloads everywhere businesses connect online. The cloud computing services running on Akamai Connected Cloud enable companies to distribute workloads and applications across the continuum of computing — from core to edge — to meet the challenges of cost, performance, and scale that centralized cloud computing platforms present today.</p>



<p><strong>Expanding our mission</strong></p>



<p>The Linode mission was about accelerating innovation by making cloud computing simple, affordable, and accessible. That mission continues as part of Akamai’s bold new vision, now with the full breadth of services that developers need, running on one of the world’s most distributed cloud platforms. It also will give developers access to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Three new enterprise-scale core cloud computing sites across the U.S. and Europe. Adding to the existing 11 cloud computing sites, the new sites will plug into the Akamai backbone — connecting them to the most distributed edge network on the planet. They also become the template for 10 additional core sites we plan to roll out across the globe throughout the year.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>More than 50 cities in which we plan to begin rolling out distributed sites this year, to bring basic cloud computing capabilities into difficult-to-reach locations currently underserved by traditional cloud providers. These regions offer a subset of Akamai’s cloud computing services but are identical in terms of availability and performance.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>Aggressive new cloud egress pricing that uses the power of Akamai’s network to drive down the cost of cloud egress by bringing CDN-like economics to cloud data transfer. The new egress pricing model is designed to result in significantly discounted egress rates relative to the hyperscalers and alternative cloud providers.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>New ISO, SOC 2, and HIPAA standards compliance, available immediately.</li>
</ul>



<p>Over the next few months, you’ll notice some cosmetic changes to your Linode experience — such as seeing the Akamai logo where the Linode logo appeared. We’re also working to improve the overall flow between the two sites to maintain the simplicity that developers have come to know from Linode as well as introduce both developers and enterprises to new services running on Akamai Connected Cloud. Over time, you’ll also notice other design and user experience improvements based on our product roadmap. For now, there are no changes to Linode’s social channels, so continue using them to communicate with us.</p>



<p>What won’t change is the price-performance, portability, and award-winning support that developers love. We appreciate the trust you put in us and we’re excited to help you build, secure, and deploy your modern applications on a cloud built for the future.</p>
