    <h1>PineNote Developer Edition – E-Paper Tablet from Pine64</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="tab-description" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-title-description">
				
	<h2>Description</h2>

<p>The PineNote is one of the world’s most advanced e-paper tablets. The device features a 1404 x 1872 resolution panel with a fast refresh rate and 16 grayscale levels. The Wacom EMR and capacitive layers are protected by hardened scratch-resistant glass with an anti-glare coating.  The device features a frontlight with 36 levels of white or amber illumination settings.</p>
<p>Powered by the fast and efficient RK3566 SoC with four A55 cores, backed by 4GB of RAM and 128GB of eMMC storage, this is a capable yet portable device capable of taking notes, writing and reading documents, reading books, browsing the internet, and terminal usage — all at the same time.</p>
<p>This first production run of the PineNote will be great to write software for, but not great to write notes on. The device ships without an operating system with flashing mode enabled. As a result, <span>this batch is strictly for developers</span>.</p>
<p><span><strong>Developers will need to use a coupon code to complete the purchase.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>NOTICE</span></p>
<p>Due to various logistics difficulties following the COVID19 pandemic the PineNote needs to be shipped and purchased separately to other items in the store. Having other items in your store basket at the time of purchase will return an error.</p>
