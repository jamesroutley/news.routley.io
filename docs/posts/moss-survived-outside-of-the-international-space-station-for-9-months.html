They found that sporophytes — cell structures that encase spores — showed the greatest stress tolerance when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light, freezing and heat.</p><p>Sporophyte samples were then placed outside of the ISS in a special <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/japanese-experiment-module-kibo/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/japanese-experiment-module-kibo/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"><u>exposure facility</u></a> attached to Japan’s Kibo module, where the samples lived for around nine months in 2022.

From this study, Fujita and his team developed a model that suggests the moss spores could actually survive for up to 5,600 days in space, or around 15 years.</p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rob8ExhctbwNLFnpJ2t276"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.</p></section></div></div></div><p>Back on Earth, the team found that most of the conditions — including the vacuum of space, microgravity and extreme temperature fluctuations — had a limited impact on the moss spores. However, samples that were exposed to light, particularly high-energy wavelengths of UV light, fared less well. Levels of pigments used by the moss for<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/51720-photosynthesis.html" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/51720-photosynthesis.html"> <u>photosynthesis</u></a>, such as chlorophyll a, were significantly reduced as a result of light damage, which affected later moss growth.</p><p>Even though some moss samples faced damage from the conditions of outer space, <em>P. patens</em> still fared much better than other plant species that have been previously tested under similar conditions. Fujita thinks the protective, spongy casing surrounding the spores may help defend against UV light and dehydration.</p><p id="69d12a0f-bd36-4b78-b3ec-abfae15954e0">&#34;This protective role may have evolved early in land plant history to help mosses colonize terrestrial habitats,&#34; he said.</p><p>While this may seem like an exercise in testing the limits of a single species, the &#34;spores&#39; success in space could offer a biological stepping stone for building ecosystems beyond our planet,&#34; Fujita said. In the future, he hopes to test other species and better understand how these resilient cells survive such stressful conditions.</p>
