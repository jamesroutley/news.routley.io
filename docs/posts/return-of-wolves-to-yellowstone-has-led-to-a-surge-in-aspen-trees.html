<p>Yellowstone&#39;s wolves are helping a new generation of young aspen trees to grow tall and join the forest canopy — the first new generation of such trees in Yellowstone&#39;s northern range in 80 years.</p><p>Gray wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/historyculture/wolf-management.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/historyculture/wolf-management.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>had disappeared from Yellowstone</u></a> National Park by 1930 following extensive habitat loss, human hunting and government eradication programs.

The canopy is more open than it is with conifers and you get filtering light that creates a habitat that supports a lot of diversity of plants.&#34;</p><p>This means a boost to berry-producing shrubs, insects and birds and also species like beavers, because<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8820&amp;context=aspen_bib" target="_blank" data-url="https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=8820&amp;context=aspen_bib" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"> <u>the trees are a preferred food and building material for the semi- aquatic rodents</u></a>, along with the willows and cottonwoods that grow near to water in the region.</p><p>There are also hints that the number of bears and cougars in the region have increased since wolves were introduced, Painter said, but it&#39;s not clear why.</p><p>&#34;The paper shows the important ecological benefits occurring from the restoration of wolves to Yellowstone National Park,&#34; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/1548/professor-dominick-spracklen" target="_blank" data-url="https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/see/staff/1548/professor-dominick-spracklen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"><u>Dominick Spracklen</u></a>, a professor of biosphere-atmosphere interactions at the University of Leeds, U.K., who has studied the potential<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2688-8319.70016" target="_blank" data-url="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2688-8319.70016" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"> <u>impacts of reintroducing wolves in Scotland</u></a>, told Live Science.</p><p>&#34;Ecosystems that lack large carnivores are often increasingly out of balance,&#34; Spracklen said. &#34;While reintroducing carnivores raises important challenges around human-wildlife coexistence, this work underscores the significant ecological benefits such restoration efforts can bring.&#34;</p><p><em>Editor&#39;s note: This article was updated at 4:52 a.m. ET on July 25 to correct an image caption that previously said more aspen were present at two of the sites studied, when they were found at most of the sites studied. </em></p>
