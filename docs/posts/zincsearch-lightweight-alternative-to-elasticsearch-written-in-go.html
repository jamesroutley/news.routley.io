							<h3>
								<p>What can I use ZincSearch for?</p>
								
							</h3>
							<p>
									ZincSearch is a search engine that can be used for indexing any kind of textual data.
									It can be used for logs, metrics, events, and more.
									It allows you to do full text search among other things.
									e.g. Send server logs to ZincSearch and search for them, or you can
									push your application data and provide full text search in your app.
								</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3>
								<p>Can I replace Elasticsearch with ZincSearch?</p>
								
							</h3>
							<p>
									ZincSearch provides Elasticsearch compatible ingestion APIs. So you can change
									the configuration (URL and authentication data) of your existing tools
									(fluent bit, vector, syslog-ng, etc) that are sending data to Elasticsearch and
									it will start working right away. To view the data you will have to use either
									ZincSearch UI or ZincSearch APIs. ZincSearch currently does not provide an Elasticsearch
									compatible query API, however we are working towards making it compatible.
								</p>

						<div>
							<h3>
								<p>Can ZincSearch be deployed in HA(Highly Available / Cluster) mode?</p>
								
							</h3>
							<p>
									Currently, No. We are working towards making ZincSearch Highly Available.
								</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3>
								<p>Can I store index data in S3 or MinIO?</p>
								
							</h3>
							<p>
									Yes. ZincSearch supports S3 and MinIO for index storage. Metadata is still stored on local disk though
									at this time.
								</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3>
								<p>Are there any performance benchmarks available for ZincSearch?</p>
								
							</h3>
							<p>
									Currently, No. We will soon publish benchmarks.
								</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3>
								<p>Do we have SDK&#39;s available for ZincSearch?</p>
								
							</h3>
							<p>
									Currently No. We are working towards making the SDKs available. You are recommended
									to use ZincSearch REST APIs for now.
