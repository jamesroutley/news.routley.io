    <h1>I think I kind of hate lazy loading</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-image.png" itemprop="https://schema.org/image"></a><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody"><p>Yesterday I was on a train. I clicked on a link and my browser loaded a long article for me to read. Halfway through reading it, the train went into a tunnel and I lost signal.</p><p>That meant I couldn&#39;t see the images on the other half of the page for the rest of the journey.  I had a sea of broken images.</p><p><img decoding="async" fetchpriority="high" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/broken-image.png" alt="An icon representing a broken image." width="644" height="314"/></p><p>Even though the <em>page</em> had fully loaded, the images were set to &#34;lazy&#34; loading. When my browser sees <code>&lt;img src=&#34;example.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; /&gt;</code> it defers downloading the picture until it is about to scroll into view.</p><p>There&#39;s a few reasons why this is a good thing. If I leave the page before scrolling down, the browser doesn&#39;t waste time, energy, or bandwidth downloading images which will never be seen. That&#39;s good for my battery life and cheaper for my bill. It also saves the server from flinging bits around the world which are promptly trashed<sup id="fnref-46755-hyp"><a href="#fn-46755-hyp" title="I am, of course, a massive hypocrite and use Lazy Loading on this blog for those very same reasons.">1</a></sup>.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>It seems that every time I&#39;m on a train - or somewhere else with spotty Internet access - I run in to a situation where I <em>previously had</em> plenty of bandwidth and battery, but my user-agent decided it knew best. So it didn&#39;t attempt to load images until <em>after</em> I lost signal.</p><p>There&#39;s no way to disable Lazy Loading on Android Chrome or Android Firefox.</p><p>So, I guess I&#39;m stuck.  Lazy loading seems like one of those things which is great in certain circumstances, but has a pretty horrible failure mode<sup id="fnref-46755-alt"><a href="#fn-46755-alt" title="Made worse by poor or non-existent alt text.">2</a></sup>.</p><p>Anyone else feel this way?</p></div></article></div>
