<P>And in celebration of this move I have put together this list;
<P><B>10 signs you're addicted to metalcasting!</B><BR><BR>
10. During barbecues you put a crucible of metal in the grill next to the hotdogs.<BR>
9. You tell your family that when you die you want to be cremated in your furnace. <BR>
8. You then tell them that you want your ashes mixed with your molding sand. <BR>
7. You refer to water as "molten ice." <BR>
6. Last time you wanted to bake cupcakes you couldn't because all the pans were burnt and charred. <BR>
5. You look at <A HREF="forshow/plantincrucible.jpg">this photo</A> and think; "Why is that plant in a giant clay crucible?" <BR>
4. You petition Wal-Mart to start selling those silver fire-proof suits in the clothing department. <BR>
3. You have a silver fire-proof tie made so you can wear the suit to fancy outings. <BR>
2. You're purposely bad all year, so on Christmas you get charcoal in your stocking. <BR>
1. You've built a mini furnace that you keep in your bedroom for nights when you can't sleep. <BR>
</P>

<P>Are you addicted to metalcasting? Go to an AA meeting... <A TARGET="_blank" HREF="http://www.alloyavenue.com/vb/forum.php">AlloyAvenue.com</A></P>
