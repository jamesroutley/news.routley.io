    <h1>New in Calibre 6.0</h1>

<p>Welcome back, calibre users. It has been a year and a half since calibre
5.0. The headline feature is <i>Full text search</i>, calibre can now <i>optionally</i>
index all the books in your library so you can search your entire library for a word or
phrase.</p>

<p>To use the new <i>Full text search</i> upgrade to calibre 6.0 and simply click the 
<code>FT</code> button to the left of the search bar in calibre. This will allow you index the
calibre library and once indexing is complete, search it.</p>


<ul id="feature-list">
    <li>
        <span>Full text search</span>
        <div>

            <p>
            calibre can <i>optionally</i> index the full text of books in the library to allow
            for instant searching of words inside any book. To use this functionality
            click the <code>FT</code> button at the left edge of the search bar.</p>

            <p>
            Then, enable indexing for the current library. Once indexing is complete you can
            search all the text in the full library. When you add new books to the library,
            they will be automatically indexed in the background. This search
            allows you to quickly find all books that contain a word or combination of
            words. You can even search for words that occur near other words, as shown in
            the examples in the search popup window.
            </p>

        <span>New CPU architectures</span>
        <p>
            calibre has gained support for the Apple Silicon CPU architecture
            on macOS and the ARM CPU architecture on Linux. Additionally, it
            has dropped support for 32-bit CPUs because Qt (one of its
            dependencies) has dropped 32-bit CPUs. In particular, on Windows
            the calibre installer will now automatically un-install 32-bit
            calibre and replace it with 64-bit calibre. This might require file
            associations or desktop shortcuts to need to be updated manually.

        <span>Read aloud in the E-book viewer</span>
        <p>
            Click the &#34;Read aloud&#34; button in the viewer controls to start reading the book text aloud from the current page.
            This works via the operating systems text-to-speech engines.

    <li>
        <span>The calibre:// URL scheme</span>
        <p>
            Clicking on <code>calibre://</code> URLs can be used to have calibre perform various actions.
            This can be sued to create links to individual books and even locations inside books that can be
            accessed from other programs.  For details, see: <a href="https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/url_scheme.html">the manual</a>.

        <span>Backwards incompatibilities</span>
        <div>

            <p>There are a few minor backwards incompatibilities to be aware of in calibre 6</p>

            <ul>

                <li>
                    Because calibre has now moved to Qt 6, some third party plugins
                    will no longer work, until they are also ported to Qt 6. Fortunately,
                    plugin developers were given over half a year to port their plugins, so most 
                    have already been ported.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If you use both calibre 5 and calibre 6 on the same library,
                    any books you add using calibre 5 will not be automatically indexed for
                    full text search, so you will periodically have to rebuild the index.
                </li>

                <li>Support for Windows 8 has been dropped as neither Qt 6 nor Microsoft support it.</li>

            </ul>

        </div>
    </li>

</ul>

<hr/>

<p>This is an appropriate time to throw out a big thank you to the calibre
community who have contributed selflessly of their energy and enthusiasm â€”
without which many of the features above would never have seen the light of
day.</p>

<p>Note that some of these features were actually introduced during the
lifetime of the 5.x series. This document describes new features as compared
to 5.0</p>
