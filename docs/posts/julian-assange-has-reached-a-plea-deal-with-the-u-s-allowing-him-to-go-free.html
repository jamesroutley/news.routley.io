    <h1>Julian Assange has reached a plea deal with the U.S., allowing him to go free</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>WASHINGTON — <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/wikileaks-julian-assange-extradition-appeal-espionage-london-court-rcna153007" target="_blank">WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange</a> was released from a British prison and on his way to a remote Pacific island on Tuesday where he will plead guilty to a conspiracy charge as part of a plea deal with the U.S. Justice Department, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nmid.6474/gov.uscourts.nmid.6474.1.0.pdf" target="_blank">court documents</a>.</p><p>The agreement will free Assange and end the yearslong legal battle over the publication of a trove of classified documents. </p><p>Assange was charged by criminal information — which typically signifies a plea deal — with conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defense information, the court documents said.</p><p>Wikileaks <a href="https://x.com/wikileaks/status/1805391265489731716" target="_blank">posted footage to X</a> of Assange boarding a plane at Stanstead Airport near London at 5 p.m. (12 p.m. ET) on Monday.</p><p><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nmid.6474/gov.uscourts.nmid.6474.3.0_1.pdf" target="_blank">A letter</a> from Justice Department official Matthew McKenzie said Assange would appear in court in the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S.-controlled territory north of Guam, at 9 a.m. local time Wednesday (7 p.m. ET Tuesday) to plead guilty.</p><p>A plane believed to be carrying Assange landed early Tuesday in the Thai capital Bangkok to refuel. He will later arrive for what could be a final court hearing after spending five years in a British jail.</p><p>The islands are 3,400 miles north of Australia, Assange&#39;s country of citizenship, where the Justice Department expects he will return following the proceedings. </p><p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said that &#34;the case has dragged on for too long, there is nothing to be gained by his continued incarceration and we want him brought home to Australia.&#34;</p><p>Assange&#39;s mother, Christine Assange, said in a statement widely reported by Australian media: &#34;I am grateful that my son’s ordeal is finally coming to an end. This shows the importance and power of quiet diplomacy.&#34;</p><p>His wife, Stella Assange, is currently in Australia with the couple&#39;s two children, aged 5 and 7, waiting for his arrival, she told BBC Radio 4. &#34;He will be a free man once it is signed off by a judge,&#34; she said, adding that she wasn&#39;t sure the deal would happen until the last 24 hours. </p><p>She said she was &#34;elated.&#34;</p><p>U.S. charges against Assange stem from one of the largest publications of classified information in American history, which took place during President Barack Obama&#39;s first term. </p><p>Starting in late 2009, according to the government, Assange conspired with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-orders-chelsea-manning-be-released-n1157381" target="_blank">Chelsea Manning</a>, a military intelligence analyst, to use his WikiLeaks website to disclose tens of thousands of activity reports about the war in Afghanistan, hundreds of thousands of reports about the war in Iraq, hundreds of thousands of State Department cables and assessment briefs of detainees at the U.S. detention camp at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.</p><p>Court documents revealing Assange&#39;s plea deal were filed Monday evening in U.S. District Court for the Northern Mariana Islands. Assange was expected to appear in that court and to be sentenced to 62 months, with credit for time served in British prison, meaning he would be free to return to Australia, where he was born.</p><figure><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-06/240625-assange-mb-0755-b1cbb3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240625-assange-mb-0755-b1cbb3.jpg 1x"/><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2024-06/240625-assange-mb-0755-b1cbb3.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240625-assange-mb-0755-b1cbb3.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240625-assange-mb-0755-b1cbb3.jpg" alt="Julian Assange &#34;is free&#34; and has been released from a high-security London prison where he was held for five years, his Wikileaks organisation said June 24, after reaching a US plea deal.
