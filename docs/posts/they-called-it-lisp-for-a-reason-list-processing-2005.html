    <h1>They Called It LISP for a Reason: List Processing (2005)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Copyright Â© 2003-2005, Peter Seibel</p><p>Lists play an important role in Lisp--for reasons both historical and
practical. Historically, lists were Lisp&#39;s original composite data
type, though it has been decades since they were its <i>only</i> such
data type. These days, a Common Lisp programmer is as likely to use a
vector, a hash table, or a user-defined class or structure as to use a
list.</p><p>Practically speaking, lists remain in the language because they&#39;re an
excellent solution to certain problems. One such problem--how to
represent code as data in order to support code-transforming and
code-generating macros--is particular to Lisp, which may explain why
other languages don&#39;t feel the lack of Lisp-style lists. More
generally, lists are an excellent data structure for representing any
kind of heterogeneous and/or hierarchical data. They&#39;re also quite
lightweight and support a functional style of programming that&#39;s
another important part of Lisp&#39;s heritage.</p><p>Thus, you need to understand lists on their own terms; as you gain a
better understanding of how lists work, you&#39;ll be in a better
position to appreciate when you should and shouldn&#39;t use them. </p><a name="there-is-no-list"><h2>&#34;There Is No List&#34;</h2></a><blockquote><b>Spoon Boy</b>: Do not try and bend the list. That&#39;s impossible.
Instead . . . only try to realize the truth.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Neo</b>: What truth?</blockquote><blockquote><b>Spoon Boy</b>: There is no list.</blockquote><blockquote><b>Neo</b>: There is no list?</blockquote><blockquote><b>Spoon Boy</b>: Then you&#39;ll see that it is not the list that bends;
it is only yourself.<sup>1</sup></blockquote><p>The key to understanding lists is to understand that they&#39;re largely
an illusion built on top of objects that are instances of a more
primitive data type. Those simpler objects are pairs of values called
<i>cons cells</i>, after the function <code><b>CONS</b></code> used to create them.</p><p><code><b>CONS</b></code> takes two arguments and returns a new cons cell containing
the two values.<sup>2</sup> These values can be references to any kind of object.
Unless the second value is <code><b>NIL</b></code> or another cons cell, a cons is
printed as the two values in parentheses separated by a dot, a
so-called dotted pair.</p><pre>(cons 1 2) ==&gt; (1 . 2)</pre><p>The two values in a cons cell are called the <code><b>CAR</b></code> and the
<code><b>CDR</b></code> after the names of the functions used to access them. At the
dawn of time, these names were mnemonic, at least to the folks
implementing the first Lisp on an IBM 704. But even then they were
just lifted from the assembly mnemonics used to implement the
operations. However, it&#39;s not all bad that these names are somewhat
meaningless--when considering individual cons cells, it&#39;s best to
think of them simply as an arbitrary pair of values without any
particular semantics. Thus:</p><pre>(car (cons 1 2)) ==&gt; 1
(cdr (cons 1 2)) ==&gt; 2</pre><p>Both <code><b>CAR</b></code> and <code><b>CDR</b></code> are also <code><b>SETF</b></code>able places--given an
existing cons cell, it&#39;s possible to assign a new value to either of
its values.<sup>3</sup></p><pre>(defparameter *cons* (cons 1 2))
*cons*                 ==&gt; (1 . 2)
(setf (car *cons*) 10) ==&gt; 10
*cons*                 ==&gt; (10 . 2)
(setf (cdr *cons*) 20) ==&gt; 20
*cons*                 ==&gt; (10 . 20)</pre><p>Because the values in a cons cell can be references to any kind of
object, you can build larger structures out of cons cells by linking
them together. Lists are built by linking together cons cells in a
chain. The elements of the list are held in the <code><b>CAR</b></code>s of the cons
cells while the links to subsequent cons cells are held in the
<code><b>CDR</b></code>s. The last cell in the chain has a <code><b>CDR</b></code> of <code><b>NIL</b></code>,
which--as I mentioned in Chapter 4--represents the empty list as
well as the boolean value false. </p><p>This arrangement is by no means unique to Lisp; it&#39;s called a
<i>singly linked list</i>. However, few languages outside the Lisp
family provide such extensive support for this humble data type.</p><p>So when I say a particular value is a list, what I really mean is
it&#39;s either <code><b>NIL</b></code> or a reference to a cons cell. The <code><b>CAR</b></code> of
the cons cell is the first item of the list, and the <code><b>CDR</b></code> is a
reference to another list, that is, another cons cell or <code><b>NIL</b></code>,
containing the remaining elements. The Lisp printer understands this
convention and prints such chains of cons cells as parenthesized
lists rather than as dotted pairs. </p><pre>(cons 1 nil)                   ==&gt; (1)
(cons 1 (cons 2 nil))          ==&gt; (1 2)
(cons 1 (cons 2 (cons 3 nil))) ==&gt; (1 2 3)</pre><p>When talking about structures built out of cons cells, a few diagrams
can be a big help. Box-and-arrow diagrams represent cons cells as a
pair of boxes like this:</p><p><img src="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/figures/one-cons-cell.png"/></p><p>The box on the left represents the <code><b>CAR</b></code>, and the box on the right
is the <code><b>CDR</b></code>. The values stored in a particular cons cell are
either drawn in the appropriate box or represented by an arrow from
the box to a representation of the referenced value.<sup>4</sup> For instance, the
list <code>(1 2 3)</code>, which consists of three cons cells linked
together by their <code><b>CDR</b></code>s, would be diagrammed like this:</p><p><img src="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/figures/list-1-2-3.png"/></p><p>However, most of the time you work with lists you won&#39;t have to deal
with individual cons cells--the functions that create and manipulate
lists take care of that for you. For example, the <code><b>LIST</b></code> function
builds a cons cells under the covers for you and links them together;
the following <code><b>LIST</b></code> expressions are equivalent to the previous
<code><b>CONS</b></code> expressions:</p><pre>(list 1)     ==&gt; (1)
(list 1 2)   ==&gt; (1 2)
(list 1 2 3) ==&gt; (1 2 3)</pre><p>Similarly, when you&#39;re thinking in terms of lists, you don&#39;t have to
use the meaningless names <code><b>CAR</b></code> and <code><b>CDR</b></code>; <code><b>FIRST</b></code> and
<code><b>REST</b></code> are synonyms for <code><b>CAR</b></code> and <code><b>CDR</b></code> that you should use
when you&#39;re dealing with cons cells as lists. </p><pre>(defparameter *list* (list 1 2 3 4))
(first *list*)        ==&gt; 1
(rest *list*)         ==&gt; (2 3 4)
(first (rest *list*)) ==&gt; 2</pre><p>Because cons cells can hold any kind of values, so can lists. And a
single list can hold objects of different types.</p><pre>(list &#34;foo&#34; (list 1 2) 10) ==&gt; (&#34;foo&#34; (1 2) 10)</pre><p>The structure of that list would look like this:</p><p><img src="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/figures/mixed-list.png"/></p><p>Because lists can have other lists as elements, you can also use them
to represent trees of arbitrary depth and complexity. As such, they
make excellent representations for any heterogeneous, hierarchical
data. Lisp-based XML processors, for instance, usually represent XML
documents internally as lists. Another obvious example of
tree-structured data is Lisp code itself. In Chapters 30 and 31
you&#39;ll write an HTML generation library that uses lists of lists to
represent the HTML to be generated. I&#39;ll talk more next chapter about
using cons cells to represent other data structures.</p><p>Common Lisp provides quite a large library of functions for
manipulating lists. In the sections &#34;List-Manipulation Functions&#34; and
&#34;Mapping,&#34; you&#39;ll look at some of the more important of these
functions. However, they will be easier to understand in the context
of a few ideas borrowed from functional programming. </p><a name="functional-programming-and-lists"><h2>Functional Programming and Lists</h2></a><p>The essence of functional programming is that programs are built
entirely of functions with no side effects that compute their results
based solely on the values of their arguments. The advantage of the
functional style is that it makes programs easier to understand.
Eliminating side effects eliminates almost all possibilities for
action at a distance. And since the result of a function is
determined only by the values of its arguments, its behavior is
easier to understand and test. For instance, when you see an
expression such as <code>(+ 3 4)</code>, you know the result is uniquely
determined by the definition of the <code><b>+</b></code> function and the values
<code>3</code> and <code>4</code>. You don&#39;t have to worry about what may have
happened earlier in the execution of the program since there&#39;s
nothing that can change the result of evaluating that expression.</p><p>Functions that deal with numbers are naturally functional since
numbers are immutable. A list, on the other hand, can be mutated, as
you&#39;ve just seen, by <code><b>SETF</b></code>ing the <code><b>CAR</b></code>s and <code><b>CDR</b></code>s of the
cons cells that make up its backbone. However, lists can be treated
as a functional data type if you consider their value to be
determined by the elements they contain. Thus, any list of the form
<code>(1 2 3 4)</code> is functionally equivalent to any other list
containing those four values, regardless of what cons cells are
actually used to represent the list. And any function that takes a
list as an argument and returns a value based solely on the contents
of the list can likewise be considered functional. For instance, the
<code><b>REVERSE</b></code> sequence function, given the list <code>(1 2 3 4)</code>,
always returns a list <code>(4 3 2 1)</code>. Different calls to
<code><b>REVERSE</b></code> with functionally equivalent lists as the argument will
return functionally equivalent result lists. Another aspect of
functional programming, which I&#39;ll discuss in the section &#34;Mapping,&#34;
is the use of higher-order functions: functions that treat other
functions as data, taking them as arguments or returning them as
results. </p><p>Most of Common Lisp&#39;s list-manipulation functions are written in a
functional style. I&#39;ll discuss later how to mix functional and other
coding styles, but first you should understand a few subtleties of
the functional style as applied to lists.</p><p>The reason most list functions are written functionally is it allows
them to return results that share cons cells with their arguments. To
take a concrete example, the function <code><b>APPEND</b></code> takes any number of
list arguments and returns a new list containing the elements of all
its arguments. For instance:</p><pre>(append (list 1 2) (list 3 4)) ==&gt; (1 2 3 4)</pre><p>From a functional point of view, <code><b>APPEND</b></code>&#39;s job is to return the
list <code>(1 2 3 4)</code> without modifying any of the cons cells in the
lists <code>(1 2)</code> and <code>(3 4)</code>. One obvious way to achieve that
goal is to create a completely new list consisting of four new cons
cells. However, that&#39;s more work than is necessary. Instead,
<code><b>APPEND</b></code> actually makes only two new cons cells to hold the values
<code>1</code> and <code>2</code>, linking them together and pointing the
<code><b>CDR</b></code> of the second cons cell at the head of the last argument,
the list <code>(3 4)</code>. It then returns the cons cell containing the
<code>1</code>. None of the original cons cells has been modified, and the
result is indeed the list <code>(1 2 3 4)</code>. The only wrinkle is that
the list returned by <code><b>APPEND</b></code> shares some cons cells with the list
<code>(3 4)</code>. The resulting structure looks like this:</p><p><img src="https://gigamonkeys.com/book/figures/after-append.png"/></p><p>In general, <code><b>APPEND</b></code> must copy all but its last argument, but it
can always return a result that <i>shares structure</i> with the last
argument.</p><p>Other functions take similar advantage of lists&#39; ability to share
structure. Some, like <code><b>APPEND</b></code>, are specified to always return
results that share structure in a particular way. Others are simply
allowed to return shared structure at the discretion of the
implementation. </p><a name="destructive-operations"><h2>&#34;Destructive&#34; Operations</h2></a><p>If Common Lisp were a purely functional language, that would be the
end of the story. However, because it&#39;s possible to modify a cons
cell after it has been created by <code><b>SETF</b></code>ing its <code><b>CAR</b></code> or
<code><b>CDR</b></code>, you need to think a bit about how side effects and
structure sharing mix.</p><p>Because of Lisp&#39;s functional heritage, operations that modify
existing objects are called <i>destructive--</i>in functional
programming, changing an object&#39;s state &#34;destroys&#34; it since it no
longer represents the same value. However, using the same term to
describe all state-modifying operations leads to a certain amount of
confusion since there are two very different kinds of destructive
operations, <i>for-side-effect</i> operations and <i>recycling</i>
operations.<sup>5</sup></p><p>For-side-effect operations are those used specifically for their side
effects. All uses of <code><b>SETF</b></code> are destructive in this sense, as are
functions that use <code><b>SETF</b></code> under the covers to change the state of
an existing object such as <code><b>VECTOR-PUSH</b></code> or <code><b>VECTOR-POP</b></code>. But
it&#39;s a bit unfair to describe these operations as
destructive--they&#39;re not intended to be used in code written in a
functional style, so they shouldn&#39;t be described using functional
terminology. However, if you mix nonfunctional, for-side-effect
operations with functions that return structure-sharing results, then
you need to be careful not to inadvertently modify the shared
structure. For instance, consider these three definitions: </p><pre>(defparameter *list-1* (list 1 2))
(defparameter *list-2* (list 3 4))
(defparameter *list-3* (append *list-1* *list-2*))</pre><p>After evaluating these forms, you have three lists, but
<code>*list-3*</code> and <code>*list-2*</code> share structure just like the
lists in the previous diagram.</p><pre>*list-1*                  ==&gt; (1 2)
*list-2*                  ==&gt; (3 4)
*list-3*                  ==&gt; (1 2 3 4)</pre><p>Now consider what happens when you modify <code>*list-2*</code>.</p><pre>(setf (first *list-2*) 0) ==&gt; 0
*list-2*                  ==&gt; (0 4)     ; as expected
*list-3*                  ==&gt; (1 2 0 4) ; maybe not what you wanted</pre><p>The change to <code>*list-2*</code> also changes <code>*list-3*</code> because of
the shared structure: the first cons cell in <code>*list-2*</code> is also
the third cons cell in <code>*list-3*</code>. <code><b>SETF</b></code>ing the <code><b>FIRST</b></code>
of <code>*list-2*</code> changes the value in the <code><b>CAR</b></code> of that cons
cell, affecting both lists.</p><p>On the other hand, the other kind of destructive operations,
recycling operations, <i>are</i> intended to be used in functional code.
They use side effects only as an optimization. In particular, they
reuse certain cons cells from their arguments when building their
result. However, unlike functions such as <code><b>APPEND</b></code> that reuse cons
cells by including them, unmodified, in the list they return,
recycling functions reuse cons cells as raw material, modifying the
<code><b>CAR</b></code> and <code><b>CDR</b></code> as necessary to build the desired result. Thus,
recycling functions can be used safely only when the original lists
aren&#39;t going to be needed after the call to the recycling function. </p><p>To see how a recycling function works, let&#39;s compare <code><b>REVERSE</b></code>,
the nondestructive function that returns a reversed version of a
sequence, to <code><b>NREVERSE</b></code>, a recycling version of the same function.
Because <code><b>REVERSE</b></code> doesn&#39;t modify its argument, it must allocate a
new cons cell for each element in the list being reversed. But
suppose you write something like this:</p><pre>(setf *list* (reverse *list*))</pre><p>By assigning the result of <code><b>REVERSE</b></code> back to <code>*list*</code>, you&#39;ve
removed the reference to the original value of <code>*list*</code>.
Assuming the cons cells in the original list aren&#39;t referenced
anywhere else, they&#39;re now eligible to be garbage collected. However,
in many Lisp implementations it&#39;d be more efficient to immediately
reuse the existing cons cells rather than allocating new ones and
letting the old ones become garbage.</p><p><code><b>NREVERSE</b></code> allows you to do exactly that. The <i>N</i> stands for
<i>non-consing</i>, meaning it doesn&#39;t need to allocate any new cons
cells. The exact side effects of <code><b>NREVERSE</b></code> are intentionally not
specified--it&#39;s allowed to modify any <code><b>CAR</b></code> or <code><b>CDR</b></code> of any
cons cell in the list--but a typical implementation might walk down
the list changing the <code><b>CDR</b></code> of each cons cell to point to the
previous cons cell, eventually returning the cons cell that was
previously the last cons cell in the old list and is now the head of
the reversed list. No new cons cells need to be allocated, and no
garbage is created.</p><p>Most recycling functions, like <code><b>NREVERSE</b></code>, have nondestructive
counterparts that compute the same result. In general, the recycling
functions have names that are the same as their non-destructive
counterparts except with a leading <i>N</i>. However, not all do,
including several of the more commonly used recycling functions such
as <code><b>NCONC</b></code>, the recycling version of <code><b>APPEND</b></code>, and <code><b>DELETE</b></code>,
<code><b>DELETE-IF</b></code>, <code><b>DELETE-IF-NOT</b></code>, and <code><b>DELETE-DUPLICATES</b></code>, the
recycling versions of the <code><b>REMOVE</b></code> family of sequence functions.</p><p>In general, you use recycling functions in the same way you use their
nondestructive counterparts except it&#39;s safe to use them only when
you know the arguments aren&#39;t going to be used after the function
returns. The side effects of most recycling functions aren&#39;t
specified tightly enough to be relied upon. </p><p>However, the waters are further muddied by a handful of recycling
functions with specified side effects that <i>can</i> be relied upon.
They are <code><b>NCONC</b></code>, the recycling version of <code><b>APPEND</b></code>, and
<code><b>NSUBSTITUTE</b></code> and its <code>-IF</code> and <code>-IF-NOT</code> variants, the
recycling versions of the sequence functions <code><b>SUBSTITUTE</b></code> and
friends.</p><p>Like <code><b>APPEND</b></code>, <code><b>NCONC</b></code> returns a concatenation of its list
arguments, but it builds its result in the following way: for each
nonempty list it&#39;s passed, <code><b>NCONC</b></code> sets the <code><b>CDR</b></code> of the list&#39;s
last cons cell to point to the first cons cell of the next nonempty
list. It then returns the first list, which is now the head of the
spliced-together result. Thus:</p><pre>(defparameter *x* (list 1 2 3))

(nconc *x* (list 4 5 6)) ==&gt; (1 2 3 4 5 6)

*x* ==&gt; (1 2 3 4 5 6)</pre><p><code><b>NSUBSTITUTE</b></code> and variants can be relied on to walk down the list
structure of the list argument and to <code><b>SETF</b></code> the <code><b>CAR</b></code>s of any
cons cells holding the old value to the new value and to otherwise
leave the list intact. It then returns the original list, which now
has the same value as would&#39;ve been computed by <code><b>SUBSTITUTE</b></code>.
<sup>6</sup></p><p>The key thing to remember about <code><b>NCONC</b></code> and <code><b>NSUBSTITUTE</b></code> is
that they&#39;re the exceptions to the rule that you can&#39;t rely on the
side effects of recycling functions. It&#39;s perfectly acceptable--and
arguably good style--to ignore the reliability of their side effects
and use them, like any other recycling function, only for the value
they return. </p><a name="combining-recycling-with-shared-structure"><h2>Combining Recycling with Shared Structure</h2></a><p>Although you can use recycling functions whenever the arguments to
the recycling function won&#39;t be used after the function call, it&#39;s
worth noting that each recycling function is a loaded gun pointed
footward: if you accidentally use a recycling function on an argument
that <i>is</i> used later, you&#39;re liable to lose some toes.</p><p>To make matters worse, shared structure and recycling functions tend
to work at cross-purposes. Nondestructive list functions return
lists that share structure under the assumption that cons cells are
never modified, but recycling functions work by violating that
assumption. Or, put another way, sharing structure is based on the
premise that you don&#39;t care exactly what cons cells make up a list
while using recycling functions requires that you know exactly what
cons cells are referenced from where.</p><p>In practice, recycling functions tend to be used in a few idiomatic
ways. By far the most common recycling idiom is to build up a list to
be returned from a function by &#34;consing&#34; onto the front of a list,
usually by <code><b>PUSH</b></code>ing elements onto a list stored in a local
variable and then returning the result of <code><b>NREVERSE</b></code>ing
it.<sup>7</sup></p><p>This is an efficient way to build a list because each <code><b>PUSH</b></code> has
to create only one cons cell and modify a local variable and the
<code><b>NREVERSE</b></code> just has to zip down the list reassigning the
<code><b>CDR</b></code>s. Because the list is created entirely within the function,
there&#39;s no danger any code outside the function has a reference to
any of its cons cells. Here&#39;s a function that uses this idiom to
build a list of the first <i>n</i> numbers, starting at zero:<sup>8</sup> </p><pre>(defun upto (max)
  (let ((result nil))
    (dotimes (i max)
      (push i result))
    (nreverse result)))

(upto 10) ==&gt; (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)</pre><p>The next most common recycling idiom<sup>9</sup> is to
immediately reassign the value returned by the recycling function
back to the place containing the potentially recycled value. For
instance, you&#39;ll often see expressions like the following, using
<code><b>DELETE</b></code>, the recycling version of <code><b>REMOVE</b></code>:</p><pre>(setf foo (delete nil foo))</pre><p>This sets the value of <code>foo</code> to its old value except with all
the <code><b>NIL</b></code>s removed. However, even this idiom must be used with
some care--if <code>foo</code> shares structure with lists referenced
elsewhere, using <code><b>DELETE</b></code> instead of <code><b>REMOVE</b></code> can destroy the
structure of those other lists. For example, consider the two lists
<code>*list-2*</code> and <code>*list-3*</code> from earlier that share their
last two cons cells. </p><pre>*list-2* ==&gt; (0 4)
*list-3* ==&gt; (1 2 0 4)</pre><p>You can delete <code>4</code> from <code>*list-3*</code> like this:</p><pre>(setf *list-3* (delete 4 *list-3*)) ==&gt; (1 2 0)</pre><p>However, <code><b>DELETE</b></code> will likely perform the necessary deletion by
setting the <code><b>CDR</b></code> of the third cons cell to <code><b>NIL</b></code>,
disconnecting the fourth cons cell, the one holding the <code>4</code>,
from the list. Because the third cons cell of <code>*list-3*</code> is also
the first cons cell in <code>*list-2*</code>, the following modifies
<code>*list-2*</code> as well:</p><pre>*list-2* ==&gt; (0)</pre><p>If you had used <code><b>REMOVE</b></code> instead of <code><b>DELETE</b></code>, it would&#39;ve built
a list containing the values <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>0</code>,
creating new cons cells as necessary rather than modifying any of the
cons cells in <code>*list-3*</code>. In that case, <code>*list-2*</code> wouldn&#39;t
have been affected. </p><p>The <code><b>PUSH</b></code>/<code><b>NREVERSE</b></code> and <code><b>SETF</b></code>/<code><b>DELETE</b></code> idioms probably
account for 80 percent of the uses of recycling functions. Other uses
are possible but require keeping careful track of which functions
return shared structure and which do not.</p><p>In general, when manipulating lists, it&#39;s best to write your own code
in a functional style--your functions should depend only on the
contents of their list arguments and shouldn&#39;t modify them. Following
that rule will, of course, rule out using any destructive functions,
recycling or otherwise. Once you have your code working, if profiling
shows you need to optimize, you can replace nondestructive list
operations with their recycling counterparts but only if you&#39;re
certain the argument lists aren&#39;t referenced from anywhere else.</p><p>One last gotcha to watch out for is that the sorting functions
<code><b>SORT</b></code>, <code><b>STABLE-SORT</b></code>, and <code><b>MERGE</b></code> mentioned in Chapter 11
are also recycling functions when applied to lists.<sup>10</sup> However, these functions don&#39;t have nondestructive
counterparts, so if you need to sort a list without destroying it,
you need to pass the sorting function a copy made with
<code><b>COPY-LIST</b></code>. In either case you need to be sure to save the result
of the sorting function because the original argument is likely to be
in tatters. For instance: </p><pre>CL-USER&gt; (defparameter *list* (list 4 3 2 1))
*LIST*
CL-USER&gt; (sort *list* #&#39;&lt;)
(1 2 3 4)                      ; looks good
CL-USER&gt; *list*
(4)                            ; whoops!</pre><a name="list-manipulation-functions"><h2>List-Manipulation Functions</h2></a><p>With that background out of the way, you&#39;re ready to look at the
library of functions Common Lisp provides for manipulating lists.</p><p>You&#39;ve already seen the basic functions for getting at the elements
of a list: <code><b>FIRST</b></code> and <code><b>REST</b></code>. Although you can get at any
element of a list by combining enough calls to <code><b>REST</b></code> (to move
down the list) with a <code><b>FIRST</b></code> (to extract the element), that can
be a bit tedious. So Common Lisp provides functions named for the
other ordinals from <code><b>SECOND</b></code> to <code><b>TENTH</b></code> that return the
appropriate element. More generally, the function <code><b>NTH</b></code> takes two
arguments, an index and a list, and returns the <i>n</i>th (zero-based)
element of the list. Similarly, <code><b>NTHCDR</b></code> takes an index and a list
and returns the result of calling <code><b>CDR</b></code> <i>n</i> times. (Thus,
<code>(nthcdr 0 ...)</code> simply returns the original list, and
<code>(nthcdr 1 ...)</code> is equivalent to <code><b>REST</b></code>.) Note, however,
that none of these functions is any more efficient, in terms of work
done by the computer, than the equivalent combinations of <code><b>FIRST</b></code>s
and <code><b>REST</b></code>s--there&#39;s no way to get to the <i>n</i>th element of a
list without following <i>n</i> <code><b>CDR</b></code> references.<sup>11</sup></p><p>The 28 composite <code><b>CAR</b></code>/<code><b>CDR</b></code> functions are another family of
functions you may see used from time to time. Each function is named
by placing a sequence of up to four <code>A</code>s and <code>D</code>s between a
<code>C</code> and <code>R</code>, with each <code>A</code> representing a call to
<code><b>CAR</b></code> and each <code>D</code> a call to <code><b>CDR</b></code>. Thus: </p><pre>(caar list) === (car (car list))
(cadr list) === (car (cdr list))
(cadadr list) === (car (cdr (car (cdr list))))</pre><p>Note, however, that many of these functions make sense only when
applied to lists that contain other lists. For instance, <code><b>CAAR</b></code>
extracts the <code><b>CAR</b></code> of the <code><b>CAR</b></code> of the list it&#39;s given; thus,
the list it&#39;s passed must contain another list as its first element.
In other words, these are really functions on trees rather than
lists:</p><pre>(caar (list 1 2 3))                  ==&gt; <i>error</i>
(caar (list (list 1 2) 3))           ==&gt; 1
(cadr (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4)))  ==&gt; (3 4)
(caadr (list (list 1 2) (list 3 4))) ==&gt; 3</pre><p>These functions aren&#39;t used as often now as in the old days. And even
the most die-hard old-school Lisp hackers tend to avoid the longer
combinations. However, they&#39;re used quite a bit in older Lisp code,
so it&#39;s worth at least understanding how they work.<sup>12</sup></p><p>The <code><b>FIRST</b></code>-<code><b>TENTH</b></code> and <code><b>CAR</b></code>, <code><b>CADR</b></code>, and so on,
functions can also be used as <code><b>SETF</b></code>able places if you&#39;re using
lists nonfunctionally.</p><p>Table 12-1 summarizes some other list functions that I won&#39;t cover in
detail. </p><p>Table 12-1. Other List Functions</p><table><tbody><tr><td>Function</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td><code><b>LAST</b></code></td><td>Returns the last cons cell in a list. With an integer, argument
returns the last <i>n</i> cons cells.</td></tr><tr><td><code><b>BUTLAST</b></code></td><td>Returns a copy of the list, excluding the last cons cell. With an
integer argument, excludes the last <i>n</i> cells.</td></tr><tr><td><code><b>NBUTLAST</b></code></td><td>The recycling version of <code><b>BUTLAST</b></code>; may modify and return the
argument list but has no reliable side effects.</td></tr><tr><td><code><b>LDIFF</b></code></td><td>Returns a copy of a list up to a given cons cell.</td></tr><tr><td><code><b>TAILP</b></code></td><td>Returns true if a given object is a cons cell that&#39;s part of the
structure of a list.</td></tr><tr><td><code><b>LIST*</b></code></td><td>Builds a list to hold all but the last of its arguments and then
makes the last argument the <code><b>CDR</b></code> of the last cell in the list. In
other words, a cross between <code><b>LIST</b></code> and <code><b>APPEND</b></code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code><b>MAKE-LIST</b></code></td><td>Builds an <i>n</i> item list. The initial elements of the list are
<code><b>NIL</b></code> or the value specified with the <code>:initial-element</code>
keyword argument.</td></tr><tr><td><code><b>REVAPPEND</b></code></td><td>Combination of <code><b>REVERSE</b></code> and <code><b>APPEND</b></code>; reverses first
argument as with <code><b>REVERSE</b></code> and then appends the second argument.</td></tr><tr><td><code><b>NRECONC</b></code></td><td>Recycling version of <code><b>REVAPPEND</b></code>; reverses first argument as if
by <code><b>NREVERSE</b></code> and then appends the second argument. No reliable

<code><b>NIL</b></code>.</td></tr><tr><td><code><b>NULL</b></code></td><td>Predicate to test whether an object is <code><b>NIL</b></code>. Functionally
equivalent to <code><b>NOT</b></code> but stylistically preferable when testing for
an empty list as opposed to boolean false.</td></tr></tbody></table><a name="mapping"><h2>Mapping</h2></a><p>Another important aspect of the functional style is the use of
higher-order functions, functions that take other functions as
arguments or return functions as values. You saw several examples of
higher-order functions, such as <code><b>MAP</b></code>, in the previous chapter.
Although <code><b>MAP</b></code> can be used with both lists and vectors (that is,
with any kind of sequence), Common Lisp also provides six mapping
functions specifically for lists. The differences between the six
functions have to do with how they build up their result and whether
they apply the function to the elements of the list or to the cons
cells of the list structure.</p><p><code><b>MAPCAR</b></code> is the function most like <code><b>MAP</b></code>. Because it always
returns a list, it doesn&#39;t require the result-type argument <code><b>MAP</b></code>
does. Instead, its first argument is the function to apply, and
subsequent arguments are the lists whose elements will provide the
arguments to the function. Otherwise, it behaves like <code><b>MAP</b></code>: the
function is applied to successive elements of the list arguments,
taking one element from each list per application of the function.
The results of each function call are collected into a new list. For
example:</p><pre>(mapcar #&#39;(lambda (x) (* 2 x)) (list 1 2 3)) ==&gt; (2 4 6)
(mapcar #&#39;+ (list 1 2 3) (list 10 20 30)) ==&gt; (11 22 33)</pre><p><code><b>MAPLIST</b></code> is just like <code><b>MAPCAR</b></code> except instead of passing the
elements of the list to the function, it passes the actual cons
cells.<sup>13</sup> Thus, the function has access not only to the value of
each element of the list (via the <code><b>CAR</b></code> of the cons cell) but also
to the rest of the list (via the <code><b>CDR</b></code>).</p><p><code><b>MAPCAN</b></code> and <code><b>MAPCON</b></code> work like <code><b>MAPCAR</b></code> and <code><b>MAPLIST</b></code>
except for the way they build up their result. While <code><b>MAPCAR</b></code> and
<code><b>MAPLIST</b></code> build a completely new list to hold the results of the
function calls, <code><b>MAPCAN</b></code> and <code><b>MAPCON</b></code> build their result by
splicing together the results--which must be lists--as if by
<code><b>NCONC</b></code>. Thus, each function invocation can provide any number of
elements to be included in the result.<sup>14</sup> <code><b>MAPCAN</b></code>, like <code><b>MAPCAR</b></code>, passes the elements of the list to
the mapped function while <code><b>MAPCON</b></code>, like <code><b>MAPLIST</b></code>, passes the
cons cells.</p><p>Finally, the functions <code><b>MAPC</b></code> and <code><b>MAPL</b></code> are control constructs
disguised as functions--they simply return their first list argument,
so they&#39;re useful only when the side effects of the mapped function
do something interesting. <code><b>MAPC</b></code> is the cousin of <code><b>MAPCAR</b></code> and
<code><b>MAPCAN</b></code> while <code><b>MAPL</b></code> is in the <code><b>MAPLIST</b></code>/<code><b>MAPCON</b></code>
family. </p><a name="other-structures"><h2>Other Structures</h2></a><p>While cons cells and lists are typically considered to be synonymous,
that&#39;s not quite right--as I mentioned earlier, you can use lists of
lists to represent trees. Just as the functions discussed in this
chapter allow you to treat structures built out of cons cells as
lists, other functions allow you to use cons cells to represent
trees, sets, and two kinds of key/value maps. I&#39;ll discuss some of
those functions in the next chapter.
</p><hr/><div><p><sup>1</sup>Adapted from <i>The Matrix</i>
  (<code>http://us.imdb.com/Quotes?0133093</code>)</p><p><sup>2</sup><code><b>CONS</b></code> was originally short for the verb
<i>construct</i>.</p><p><sup>3</sup>When the place given to <code><b>SETF</b></code> is a <code><b>CAR</b></code> or
<code><b>CDR</b></code>, it expands into a call to the function <code><b>RPLACA</b></code> or
<code><b>RPLACD</b></code>; some old-school Lispers--the same ones who still use
<code><b>SETQ</b></code>--will still use <code><b>RPLACA</b></code> and <code><b>RPLACD</b></code> directly, but
modern style is to use <code><b>SETF</b></code> of <code><b>CAR</b></code> or <code><b>CDR</b></code>.</p><p><sup>4</sup>Typically,
simple objects such as numbers are drawn within the appropriate box,
and more complex objects will be drawn outside the box with an arrow
from the box indicating the reference. This actually corresponds well
with how many Common Lisp implementations work--although all objects
are conceptually stored by reference, certain simple immutable
objects can be stored directly in a cons cell.</p><p><sup>5</sup>The phrase <i>for-side-effect</i> is used in the
language standard, but <i>recycling</i> is my own invention; most Lisp
literature simply uses the term <i>destructive</i> for both kinds of
operations, leading to the confusion I&#39;m trying to dispel.</p><p><sup>6</sup>The string functions <code><b>NSTRING-CAPITALIZE</b></code>,
<code><b>NSTRING-DOWNCASE</b></code>, and <code><b>NSTRING-UPCASE</b></code> are similar--they
return the same results as their N-less counterparts but are
specified to modify their string argument in place.</p><p><sup>7</sup>For example, in an examination of all uses of recycling
functions in the Common Lisp Open Code Collection (CLOCC), a diverse
set of libraries written by various authors, instances of the
<code><b>PUSH</b></code>/<code><b>NREVERSE</b></code> idiom accounted for nearly half of all uses
of recycling functions.</p><p><sup>8</sup>There
are, of course, other ways to do this same thing. The extended
<code><b>LOOP</b></code> macro, for instance, makes it particularly easy and likely
generates code that&#39;s even more efficient than the <code><b>PUSH</b></code>/
<code><b>NREVERSE</b></code> version.</p><p><sup>9</sup>This idiom accounts for 30
percent of uses of recycling in the CLOCC code base.</p><p><sup>10</sup><code><b>SORT</b></code>
and <code><b>STABLE-SORT</b></code> can be used as for-side-effect operations on
vectors, but since they still return the sorted vector, you should
ignore that fact and use them for return values for the sake of
consistency.</p><p><sup>11</sup><code><b>NTH</b></code> is
roughly equivalent to the sequence function <code><b>ELT</b></code> but works only
with lists. Also, confusingly, <code><b>NTH</b></code> takes the index as the first
argument, the opposite of <code><b>ELT</b></code>. Another difference is that
<code><b>ELT</b></code> will signal an error if you try to access an element at an
index greater than or equal to the length of the list, but <code><b>NTH</b></code>
will return <code><b>NIL</b></code>.</p><p><sup>12</sup>In
particular, they used to be used to extract the various parts of
expressions passed to macros before the invention of destructuring
parameter lists. For example, you could take apart the following
expression:</p><pre>(when (&gt; x 10) (print x))</pre><p>Like this:</p><pre>;; the condition
(cadr &#39;(when (&gt; x 10) (print x))) ==&gt; (&gt; X 10)</pre><pre>;; the body, as a list
(cddr &#39;(when (&gt; x 10) (print x))) ==&gt; ((PRINT X))</pre><p><sup>13</sup>Thus, <code><b>MAPLIST</b></code> is the more primitive of the two
functions--if you had only <code><b>MAPLIST</b></code>, you could build <code><b>MAPCAR</b></code>
on top of it, but you couldn&#39;t build <code><b>MAPLIST</b></code> on top of
<code><b>MAPCAR</b></code>.</p><p><sup>14</sup>In Lisp dialects that
didn&#39;t have filtering functions like <code><b>REMOVE</b></code>, the idiomatic way
to filter a list was with <code><b>MAPCAN</b></code>.</p><pre>(mapcan #&#39;(lambda (x) (if (= x 10) nil (list x)))  list) === (remove 10 list)</pre></div></div>
