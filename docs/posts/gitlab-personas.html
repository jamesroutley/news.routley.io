<h2 id="on-this-page">On this page</h2>

<h2 id="roles-vs-personas">Roles vs personas</h2>
<p>Personas describe the ideal target for GitLab. They help us define our messaging and marketing delivery. They are theoretical people to target. By defining their concerns and where they go for information, we can best spend our marketing dollars and sales efforts by focusing on this ideal target.</p>
<p>Roles are distinct job titles. These are the real people you will encounter while selling. You will find a contact at an account with a specific role. Understanding the challenges faced by each role in IT, along with what they care most about, is helpful to deliver the right value proposition to the right person.</p>
<h2 id="personas">Personas</h2>
<p>Personas are a generalized way of talking about the ideal target we are aiming to communicate with and design for. They help us not only define our messaging and marketing delivery, but also our product. Keeping personas in mind allows us to use the correct language and make the best decisions to address their specific problems and pain points. GitLab has both <a href="#buyer-personas">buyer</a> and <a href="#user-personas">user</a> persona types.</p>
<h3 id="buyer-personas">Buyer personas</h3>
<p>We are iterating on updates to buyer personas on this <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/brand-and-product-marketing/product-and-solution-marketing/roles-personas/buyer-persona/">Buyer Persona</a> page.</p>
<h3 id="user-personas">User personas</h3>
<p>User personas are people who actually use GitLab. They may or may not be the person in
the organization who has the authority and budget to purchase GitLab, but they
are heavy influencers in the buying process. Users personas are created from data gathered from UX research studies. If a new user persona is needed, or an existing persona has to be updated, see our handbook guide on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/persona-creation/">How to Create a User Persona</a>.</p>
<h4 id="how-do-user-personas-interact">How do user personas interact?</h4>
<p>While user personas are often distinct individuals it is equally important to understand how multiple personas interact as to understand the workflows and motivations of individual personas.
As a result we will also consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organization Archetype</li>
<li>Persona Composition</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="organizational-archetype">Organizational Archetype</h5>
<p>Organizational archetype describe how organizations have structured their software development process and teams.
They help us understand common structures and the resulting types of interactions that the personas in those structures experience.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll build out descriptions of common organizational archetype as our research continues
and introduce new personas that fit into these new organization archetypes.</p>
<p>It can happen that a persona from one organizational archetype will have similar jobs-to-be-done,
or other characteristics, as one or even multiple personas from another organizational archetype.
Describing all of them will help us understand the differences that could otherwise go unnoticed
and make better-focused decisions during product development. <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/personas/organization-archetype/">Learn more</a> about the organizational archetypes GitLab is addressing.</p>
<h4 id="list-of-user-personas">List of User Personas</h4>
<p>We describe the following personas in terms of the jobs they do, their motivations and frustrations. Understanding our users through this lens helps us contribute to a product that supports their workflow.</p>

<p>I’m the firefighter of the Security team. My objective is to <strong>prevent malicious attacks</strong> and <strong>mitigate active risks</strong> to my organization as they pop up, as <strong>quickly</strong> as possible. In order to do that, I develop detection tooling that generates <strong>trustworthy alerts</strong>, and take part in an on-call rotation where I serve as an <strong>Incident Responder</strong>.</p>
<p><em>“I need to be jack of all trades: When SecOps get paged, it could be about anything, and there’s a high probability that the incident concerns something you’ve never dealt with before. The sky could be falling and there’s a lot at stake and so the role of a security operations person can be pretty stressful.”</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Manage incident response:</strong> When I am on-call, I need to respond to and manage incidents as they pop up, so as to mitigate the risk to my organization as quickly as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time documentation:</strong> As an incident unfolds, I want to document as much of what is happening as possible, so that later on I could use that information as part of updating or creating a runbook, and possibly creating an RCA (Root Cause Analysis).</li>
<li><strong>Building detection tools:</strong> When I’m not on-call, I want to build tools that enhance our detection and alerting capabilities, so as to improve my organization’s security stance.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term project management:</strong> As an incident unfolds, I want to assign tasks and coordinate the work of multiple individuals across my organization, so I can move as quickly as possible to remediate the risk.</li>

<ul>
<li>It is cumbersome to edit description of timeline in real-time, and it’s especially difficult to do in hindsight. Often the timeline documentation isn’t completed.</li>
<li>Often important parts of the info I need in order to handle the incident are either not communicated fully, or are being communicated in an unstructured manner which makes aggregation and searching difficult.</li>

<p>I’m a software engineer in my organization with a keen interest in quality and the skills necessary to promote it. My objective is to <strong>help build quality into the development process</strong> and <strong>promote ownership of quality across every team</strong>. To accomplish this, I develop tooling to support test processes and quality reporting. I also write tests at every level in the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/testing_guide/testing_levels.html">test pyramid</a>. I groom my organization&#39;s tests to make them both efficient and effective as well as help grow a quality mindset across departments.</p>

<li><strong>Develop and maintain test frameworks:</strong> I need to provide the engineers in my organization with one or more well-maintained test frameworks that facilitate writing tests at the appropriate level.</li>
<li><strong>Provide tooling and reporting to facilitate quality:</strong> I need to create and maintain both tooling and reporting that allows developers to more easily accomplish quality-related tasks and provide feedback to engineering and management.</li>
<li><strong>Perform quality planning with counterparts:</strong> I want to interact with my engineering counterparts on a regular basis, tracking what is coming up for development as well as what is happening now and what is being delivered. Knowing this, I need to be able to identify both the riskiest and most important work being done so I can provide quality feedback at the appropriate time through performing code reviews and having discussions about both the design and implementation of the features.</li>
<li><strong>Manage Test Environments</strong> I also provision and maintain test environments that are representative of the software being used in production. Through these environments testing can then occur that is as realistic as possible and catch issues earlier.</li>
