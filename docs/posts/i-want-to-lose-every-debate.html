<p>
	My favorite moments in life are when someone shows me a new perspective — a way of thinking I had never considered.
	It’s illuminating.
</p><p>
	Ideally it’s something I opposed, but they help me understand why it works for them.
</p><ul><li>
	The sex worker explains why she loves her job.
</li><li>
	The Singaporean in the three-piece-suit explains why clothing is like the SMTP protocol.
</li><li>
	The Hindu explains why poverty doesn’t upset her.
</li><li>
	The Muslim explains why Islamic law is a perfect recipe for peace.
</li><li>
	The hedonist justifies her partying, and tells me the most heart-warming explanation for her ugly tattoo.
</li></ul><p>
	These conversations are the most memorable — the most life-changing — because I get a <strong>personal introduction to a mindset</strong>.
	Then those people I thought were wrong, stupid, or crazy suddenly make sense.
</p><p>
	Thinking that people are <a href="https://sive.rs/ss">stupid</a> is not thinking.
	Understanding them is.
</p><p>
	They lend me their shoes and glasses, so I can walk a mile with their viewpoint and experience it for myself.
	It helps me see why it works for them, and how it might work for me.
</p><p>
<strong>
	I never want to debate, but if I had to, I would hope to lose.
</strong>
	I don’t want to convince anyone of my existing perspective.
	I would rather be convinced of theirs.
	It’s more interesting to assume that they are right.
