For data on all sources, and larger versions of the graphs, see </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-one" rel="">Rausch and Haidt (2023)</a><span>. Before 2010, there was not much happening. By 2015, self-harm episodes were at record-high levels in all five countries. (Data for Canada is limited to Ontario province, which contains nearly 40% of the population of Canada.)</span></p><p><span>I have added a shaded area on all graphs from 2010 to 2015, which is the period that Jon calls “The Great Rewiring of Childhood” in his forthcoming book, </span><em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/729231/the-anxious-generation-by-jonathan-haidt/9780593655030" rel="">The Anxious Generation</a></em><span>. It’s the five-year period when adolescence changed to a phone-based form; adolescents went from nearly all owning flip phones (or other basic phones) to nearly all owning smartphones with high-speed data plans and continuous (and nearly unlimited) access to the internet and social media. This is the five-year period in which adolescent mental health began to deteriorate around the Western world.</span></p><p><span>But not all researchers are convinced that the mental health crisis is so dire, or even that it is real. Some skeptics have raised a </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-resistance-hypothesis/202305/the-teen-suicide-rate-has-not-increased-throughout-the-world" rel="">number</a><span> of </span><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/checkpoints/202304/social-media-and-youth-mental-health" rel="">concerns</a><span>, particularly about suicide rates—a topic that we have not said much about on this Substack because we have been trying to figure it out for ourselves. </span></p><p>Suicide is a “hard metric”—it is a number carefully counted (not estimated) by national governments. Anxiety and depression are more difficult to measure accurately. And so, if youth suicide rates were unchanged or even declining since 2010 it would significantly complicate our story that the transition from play-based childhood to phone-based childhood is a major cause of the international decline in adolescent mental health. </p><p><span>In fact, some </span><em>do</em><span> point to data showing that rates of suicide among young people have been steady or declining since the 2000s. See, for example, Max Roser’s </span><a href="https://twitter.com/MaxCRoser/status/1641146860281659406" rel="">tweet</a><span> earlier this year (from Our World in Data):</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd381e9e3-3339-4485-bf42-183c5d92fb96_1066x1292.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd381e9e3-3339-4485-bf42-183c5d92fb96_1066x1292.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd381e9e3-3339-4485-bf42-183c5d92fb96_1066x1292.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd381e9e3-3339-4485-bf42-183c5d92fb96_1066x1292.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd381e9e3-3339-4485-bf42-183c5d92fb96_1066x1292.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd381e9e3-3339-4485-bf42-183c5d92fb96_1066x1292.png" width="1066" height="1292" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d381e9e3-3339-4485-bf42-183c5d92fb96_1066x1292.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:1292,&#34;width&#34;:1066,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;Max Roser Tweet Showing Trends in Suicide Not Getting Worse Since 2010 in many countries&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="Max Roser Tweet Showing Trends in Suicide Not Getting Worse Since 2010 in many countries" title="Max Roser Tweet Showing Trends in Suicide Not Getting Worse Since 2010 in many countries" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd381e9e3-3339-4485-bf42-183c5d92fb96_1066x1292.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd381e9e3-3339-4485-bf42-183c5d92fb96_1066x1292.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd381e9e3-3339-4485-bf42-183c5d92fb96_1066x1292.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd381e9e3-3339-4485-bf42-183c5d92fb96_1066x1292.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>Roser is correct that </span><em><a href="https://time.com/5523659/global-suicide-rate-decrease/#tbl-em-lnncyllcpelfsmwwob9" rel="">overall</a></em><span> suicide rates are not increasing across all nations.</span><span> But it would be a mistake to conclude that the United States is unique, or that there is not a worrying international trend in youth suicide rates. Here are four reasons why:  </span></p><ol><li><p><strong>Those graphs fail to break results down by </strong><em><strong>sex. </strong></em><span>The mental health crisis is gendered, with girls showing the most substantial and rapid changes in mental illness since the early 2010s.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>They fail to consider how young people are doing </strong><em><strong>relative to older people</strong></em><strong> in each country. </strong><span>Anxiety rates are surging among youth, while only slightly increasing for U.S. adults. Perhaps suicide rates overall are dropping, but not for young people, or not as fast for young people. If so, we’d still want to know: why are young people not sharing in the decline in suicide? </span></p></li><li><p><strong>They don’t break out data for 10-14-year-olds,</strong><span> where there are the largest </span><em>relative</em><span> increases since 2010 in poor mental health. (These effects are harder to see on graphs that also show older age groups because of the low base rates for 10-14-year-olds). </span></p></li><li><p><strong>They fail to consider cultural variation. </strong><span>While there has been a </span><a href="https://time.com/5523659/global-suicide-rate-decrease/#tbl-em-lnncyllcpelfsmwwob9" rel="">global decline in suicide rates</a><span> over the past century, particularly among older adults in non-western nations, my previous posts have found significant regional and cultural effects on mental health outcomes. Thus, some cultural variation should be expected, rather than immediately seen as counter-evidence.</span></p></li></ol><p>Thus, we need to look more closely at the suicide data because many of the analyses being done are conducted in ways that might obscure real changes, particularly for girls and young women. </p><p>So let’s increase the resolution and see if a trend emerges. In this post, I examine suicide rates among Gen Z in the five Anglosphere countries, comparing rates between sexes, between age groups, and with earlier generations when they were in their youth. It turns out that in each of the five Anglosphere nations, suicide rates among adolescent girls (ages 10-19) are at all-time highs (since modern records have been kept). Suicide rates for Gen Z girls now surpass those seen during the adolescent and young adult years of Millennials (born 1981-1995), Gen X (born 1965-1980), and Boomers (born 1945-1964). </p><p><span>For adolescent boys, I’ll show that the changes are more varied across nations and that only some nations are reaching historical peaks. I was surprised to discover that it was the </span><em>Gen X boys</em><span> who showed the most consistent peaks in suicide rates (back in the 1980s and early 1990s) across the five Anglosphere nations.</span></p><p><span>In short, the suicide data among </span><em>Gen Z girls</em><span> is consistent with the story we have told on this Substack about rising anxiety, depression, and self-harm. The adolescent mental health crisis is </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/the-teen-mental-illness-epidemic" rel="">real</a><span>, </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/international-mental-illness-part-one" rel="">international</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://jonathanhaidt.substack.com/p/mental-health-liberal-girls" rel="">gendered</a><span>. And if that is true, then the many theories put forth to explain the mental health crisis in the U.S. may have only limited explanatory power. We must also look for something that changed in the lives of adolescents, and especially adolescent girls, in many countries simultaneously, in the years around 2010.</span></p><p>The Centers for Disease Control’s Fatal Injury Report reveals a troubling trend: While suicide rates for both sexes had been declining since the 1980s, they began rising in the early 2000s for older adults and then for adolescents from 2008 onwards. Among the most notable recent trends is that the rates for girls aged 10-24 rose by approximately 77% between 2007-2009 and 2017-2019 (Note: To determine the relative change in suicide rates throughout this post, I average the suicide rate for the three years before the Great Rewiring, 2007-2009, and I compare it to the three years before the COVID pandemic began in 2020––in this case, 2017-2019. This gives us a stable and consistent measure across nations that is not contaminated by the effects of the pandemic and its associated restrictions, which varied in severity across nations.)</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c801ca8-7b77-4a94-b840-301a5f4e495f_1600x542.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c801ca8-7b77-4a94-b840-301a5f4e495f_1600x542.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c801ca8-7b77-4a94-b840-301a5f4e495f_1600x542.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c801ca8-7b77-4a94-b840-301a5f4e495f_1600x542.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c801ca8-7b77-4a94-b840-301a5f4e495f_1600x542.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c801ca8-7b77-4a94-b840-301a5f4e495f_1600x542.png" width="1456" height="493" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4c801ca8-7b77-4a94-b840-301a5f4e495f_1600x542.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:493,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;U.S. Adolescent and Adult Suicide Rates (Ages 10-59), 1981-2021. &#34;,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="U.S. Adolescent and Adult Suicide Rates (Ages 10-59), 1981-2021.

Understanding this significant disparity is crucial for any discussion about suicide. Suicidologists have found that this gender gap in suicide </span><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/gender-differences-in-suicide-methods-1067508" rel="">is</a><span> </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11079640/" rel="">partly</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3539603/" rel="">due</a><span> to the fact that boys tend to use more lethal means than girls, and have </span><a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-017-1398-8" rel="">higher suicidal intent</a><span>.

You can also see that the lines for Gen Z (in blue) are higher than for previous generations, for both sexes but especially for girls. </span><em>Gen Z girls and young women in all three age groups have died by suicide at much higher rates than any previous generation.</em><span> Gen Z boys, in contrast, have died by suicide at rates that were only a little higher than those of previous generations.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27d5aec-301c-43e1-9882-a521d5a0bb4e_1802x660.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27d5aec-301c-43e1-9882-a521d5a0bb4e_1802x660.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27d5aec-301c-43e1-9882-a521d5a0bb4e_1802x660.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27d5aec-301c-43e1-9882-a521d5a0bb4e_1802x660.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27d5aec-301c-43e1-9882-a521d5a0bb4e_1802x660.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27d5aec-301c-43e1-9882-a521d5a0bb4e_1802x660.png" width="1456" height="533" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f27d5aec-301c-43e1-9882-a521d5a0bb4e_1802x660.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:533,&#34;width&#34;:1456,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:157412,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27d5aec-301c-43e1-9882-a521d5a0bb4e_1802x660.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27d5aec-301c-43e1-9882-a521d5a0bb4e_1802x660.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27d5aec-301c-43e1-9882-a521d5a0bb4e_1802x660.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff27d5aec-301c-43e1-9882-a521d5a0bb4e_1802x660.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Figure 4. </strong><span>U.S. suicide rates across the lifespan by generation.

In all five nations, rates began to plummet in the 1990s and early 2000s. And in four of these nations (though Canadian boys did not rise much), rates began rising again in the late 2000s or early 2010s. The story for boys is as much a story about a previous generation, Generation X (born 1965-1980), as it is about Generation Z (born 1996-2012). This “roller coaster” pattern of suicide rates was crystal clear for boys in the U.S., UK, and Australia.

In fact, in the United States, suicide rates among women are highest in their fifties, while among men rates are highest in their 80s. Efforts to reduce suicide should be made for all impacted populations.</span></p><p><span>At the same time, the spike in suicides among adolescent girls is so new and so large that it calls for intense efforts to identify the causes, and for efforts to change whatever is causing it. One of the most important facts about adolescent suicidality is that the motives among young people are often different than those among adults. Adolescents are much more likely to commit suicide </span><a href="https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-019-2213-5" rel="">as a result</a><span> of </span><em>interpersonal problems, </em><span>while adults have more varied motivations—including illnesses and financial setbacks, as well as interpersonal reasons. </span></p><p><span>There was one seismic shift in how </span><em>interpersonal relationships </em><span>work that fits the timing well: the global and simultaneous migration of adolescent social life onto smartphones and social media platforms, which happened roughly between 2010 and 2015. In </span><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anxious-Generation-Rewiring-Childhood-Epidemic/dp/0593655036" rel="">The Anxious Generation</a></em><span>, Jon shows that this evolution fundamentally altered the dynamics of interpersonal relationships, shifting childhood from one that was (generally) in-person, embodied, synchronous, and play-based to one that was (generally) virtual, disembodied, largely asynchronous, and phone-based. Since the early 2010s, stable in-person communities and relationships have rapidly disintegrated, as transient networks of low-investment relationships took their place. Figure 19 shows that American teens and young adults were already socially distanced from each other by 2019, </span><em>before</em><span> covid restrictions were imposed on them. </span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e8bf2e-9b4a-47d5-a342-7c77f36c3e35_806x666.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e8bf2e-9b4a-47d5-a342-7c77f36c3e35_806x666.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e8bf2e-9b4a-47d5-a342-7c77f36c3e35_806x666.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e8bf2e-9b4a-47d5-a342-7c77f36c3e35_806x666.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e8bf2e-9b4a-47d5-a342-7c77f36c3e35_806x666.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"/><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e8bf2e-9b4a-47d5-a342-7c77f36c3e35_806x666.png" width="577" height="476.77667493796525" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/66e8bf2e-9b4a-47d5-a342-7c77f36c3e35_806x666.png&#34;,&#34;srcNoWatermark&#34;:null,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:666,&#34;width&#34;:806,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:577,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null,&#34;belowTheFold&#34;:true,&#34;topImage&#34;:false,&#34;internalRedirect&#34;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e8bf2e-9b4a-47d5-a342-7c77f36c3e35_806x666.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e8bf2e-9b4a-47d5-a342-7c77f36c3e35_806x666.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e8bf2e-9b4a-47d5-a342-7c77f36c3e35_806x666.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66e8bf2e-9b4a-47d5-a342-7c77f36c3e35_806x666.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"/></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Figure 19. </strong><span>Total number of minutes spent with friends per day (annual daily average). </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36618547/" rel="">Kannan &amp; Veazie (2023)</a><span> analyzing the </span><a href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/" rel="">American Time Use Study</a><span>.
