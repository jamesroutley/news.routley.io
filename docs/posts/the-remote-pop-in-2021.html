    <h1>The Remote Pop-In (2021)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

<p>
This page describes a method of dealing with one of the missing features of
fully remote teams: the pop-in.
</p>
<h2>The Pop-In</h2>
<p>
The pop-in, back before open floorplans, is when you physically walk into
someone&#39;s office to ask them a question or spitball an idea. In an open
floorplan you can instead swivel your chair or walk to their desk.
</p>
<p>
The pop-in is valuable because it&#39;s as informal as email, but as
high-bandwidth and low-latency as meetings. It&#39;s interruptive to be popped in
on, but that interruption power is self-limiting: the effort of physically
going somewhere is high, and the tools available to the target like doors,
signs, and social cues are numerous and don&#39;t require much thought to
implement.
</p>
<p>
Slack DMs come close to replacing the pop-in, but they reduce the effort too
much. This leads to more interruptions (a little lower in intensity, but a lot
higher in number) and even to the replacement of trackers, emails, and wikis
with DMs.
</p>
<p>
There&#39;s a lot wrong with the pop-in, but like any tool it has its uses. Many
great products<span>—</span>companies, even<span>—</span>have been built on the shoulders of
the pop-in.
</p>
<h2>The Remote Pop-In</h2>
<p>
There&#39;s really no remote equivalent to the pop-in. There are products that
help you &#34;hang out&#34; like Facebook Portal, but nothing that implements the
pop-in.
</p>
<p>
At <a href="https://yourbase.io">YourBase</a> we decided we needed one. Rather
than build another tool, we experimented with Discord. I&#39;m happy to say we
found something that works, and even solves the worst problem of the
open-office pop-in: the inability to shut your damned door.
</p>
<h3>The Setup</h3>

<p>
In our company Discord server, we give everyone one voice channel of their
own. This is your &#34;office&#34;. When you are online and able to be disturbed, you
join your office, alone. You stay in there as long as you are &#34;in&#34;.
</p>
<p>
Because of how Discord works, everyone can see who is in what office at all
times. But you can only hear conversations for the room you&#39;re in, and you can
only be in one room at a time. Joining a room plays an obvious audio chime and
is not something you can do sneakily.
</p>
<p>
When someone wants to pop in, they join your voice channel. The chime plays,
they say hello, you unmute and turn on video if you like, and have your
pop-in. And that&#39;s really it.
</p>
<p>
If you&#39;re going to the restroom and will be AFK, you can join the restroom
channel. You&#39;re in, but away. No one is actually wearing a headset on the
toilet, it&#39;s just a fun way to feel like a real office.
</p>
<p>We&#39;ve even fallen into some typical office behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
We&#39;ve started having meetings in people&#39;s offices, just because it&#39;s easier.
</li>
<li>
We have a &#34;cafeteria&#34; room where you can eat your lunch if you&#39;ve got
nothing going on in real life. We also hold lunch-and-learns here.
</li>
<li>
We have a &#34;rooftop&#34; and other common spaces where some people chill, which
signals that they&#39;re open for a chat.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The oddest one is that when it&#39;s slow around the office, you can tell. You can
almost hear how quiet it is when you&#39;re the first one in or the last one out.
</p>
<p>
The pop-in is valuable because it&#39;s informal, high bandwidth, and low latency.
Enabling it using Discord has worked very well for us over the last six
months, and we didn&#39;t even have to build anything.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a> for making such a
flexible platform. Thanks to <a href="https://yourbase.io">YourBase</a> for
being so open to crazy ideas. (Check us out if your CI is slow.)
