<h3>Get Involved in the Collective</h3>
<p><strong>Haven’t taken part in a Nature Nurtures session yet?</strong></p>
<p>A session is held twice a month on one of the London Wildlife Trust reserves, each session focuses on developing your creative skills, confidence and knowledge within the outdoors and provides you with the opportunity to collaborate with other young people. The sessions are led by London Wildlife Trust providing guidance for conservation and ecology-based tasks; Black Girls Hike partner with us on guided walks and wellbeing sessions and Spread the Word provide workshops on creative writing and thinking.</p>
<p>It’s been amazing to watch those of you who’ve never touched nature photography before to produce images like these:</p>
