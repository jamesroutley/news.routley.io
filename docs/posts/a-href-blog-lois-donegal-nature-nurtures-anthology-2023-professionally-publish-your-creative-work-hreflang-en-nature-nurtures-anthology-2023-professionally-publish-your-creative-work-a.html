          <div><div><p>The Nature Nurtures Conservation + Creative Arts Collective is a cross-sector project led by London Wildlife Trust with partners Spread the Word, Black Girls Hike CIC and London Youth. The project has a whole host of exciting opportunities for young people to connect with nature and each other.</p>
<p>It’s been a wonderful journey so far building up the Nature Nurtures Collective with London’s youth across our nature reserves! When designing the project, one of the key elements we wanted to provide was the space and opportunity for young people to connect with our landscapes, draw inspiration from nature and share that magic with others.</p>

<h3>Get Involved in the Collective</h3>
<p><strong>Haven’t taken part in a Nature Nurtures session yet?</strong></p>
<p>A session is held twice a month on one of the London Wildlife Trust reserves, each session focuses on developing your creative skills, confidence and knowledge within the outdoors and provides you with the opportunity to collaborate with other young people. The sessions are led by London Wildlife Trust providing guidance for conservation and ecology-based tasks; Black Girls Hike partner with us on guided walks and wellbeing sessions and Spread the Word provide workshops on creative writing and thinking.</p>
<p>It’s been amazing to watch those of you who’ve never touched nature photography before to produce images like these:</p>

  <div>
          <div><div><p>And having seasoned poets join us to share impactful imagery through words such as:</p>
<p><strong>Thunder Thursday</strong></p>
<p><em>Today, cloud watching reveals only the sky’s swollen bosom </em></p>
<p><em>The air is alive. </em></p>
<p><em>The sky cracks open like a fortune cookie - </em></p>
<p><em>Books become umbrellas </em></p>
<p>Water upon water upon water. </p>
<p>The sky does not weep but shrieks. </p>
<p>We only listen to the voice that is loudest, </p>

<p>I am responsible for planning and facilitating the session and  Nature Nurtures has really shown me how important it is to get back in touch with a sense of play and curiosity. We&#39;re often overly critical about our creative outputs and it&#39;s been a wonderful experience to be part of a space where creativity is nourished and celebrated. If there are any thoughts you want to share or ideas you want to explore, let me know! My dream is for Nature Nurtures to grow as youth-led collective. We are keen to ensure that inclusion needs are met as best as possible, so please feel free to let us know if there&#39;s anything we can introduce into the sessions. You can contact me at <a href="mailto:cnwanodi@wildlondon.org.uk">cnwanodi@wildlondon.org.uk</a>.</p>
<p>Nature Nurtures is supported by funds awarded by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sports, via the Volunteering Futures Fund distributed by Arts Council England.</p>
