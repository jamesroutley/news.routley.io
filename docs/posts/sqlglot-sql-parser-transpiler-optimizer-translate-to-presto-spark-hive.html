        <div><p>My goals for this week were fairly modest. Here are some of them with notes and
links to resources I found useful.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.jfo.click/keyboard-closeup.jpg"/></p>
<h2 id="get-my-feet-under-me-for-fully-remote-interaction">Get my feet under me for fully remote interaction</h2>
<p>This is going pretty well. I&#39;ve set up a good mic and I have a decent enough
webcam, I think the zoom experience is as good as can be expected at the moment
given how distributed people are (and that many are in the US). Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.benkuhn.net/vc/">a helpful
guide</a> I found on optimizing that. I did run a LAN
cable to my desktop earlier this week which dramatically improved my
connection&#39;s speed and stability. The highest I&#39;ve seen on fast.com is 1.2
gigabits down, which is, uh, good enough for me!</p>
<p>Of course like many of us I had been through periods of fully remote work in
the past few years, so this wasn&#39;t too much of a shock. But I&#39;ve definitely
never met so many people fully remotely at the same time, so that was a bit
new.</p>
<h2 id="yak-shaving">Yak shaving</h2>
<p>Yes, that old chestnut. I&#39;ve been pruning my configuration and setup files to
be less crufty, more aligned with the software I&#39;m actually using, and specific
to the computer I&#39;m primarily working on. It&#39;s actually been really satisfying,
like getting an actual much needed haircut. This included
learning about and switching to
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html">stow</a>, a &#34;symlink farm
manager.&#34; I was considering switching to a full fledged configuration manager,
like <a href="https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager">home manager</a> or
<a href="https://www.chezmoi.io/#considering-using-chezmoi">chezmoi</a> but these and other
options presented were either platform specific or too heavy for my needs and
tastes. <code>stow</code> essentially does what I was doing before with sticks-and-glue
scripts but is more generally useful on top of that. I run the command in my
dotfiles repo and it creates the appropriate symlinks where I point it.</p>
<p>This category includes setting up LSP clients for both
<a href="https://deno.land/manual/language_server">Deno</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/zigtools/zls">Zig</a> for use with neovim. Both of them work
incredibly well, actually.</p>
<p>I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m getting into a pretty good state with these particular
yaks, so I am going to try to switch back into maintainance mode from next
week, although still on the list: lsp aware omnicomplete, snippets, and
re-blinging my shell prompt ðŸ˜Ž.</p>
<h2 id="static-site-generator-hacking">Static site generator hacking</h2>
<p>I wrote a static site generator for use with this blog before starting my
batch, and though it&#39;s really basic, it works just fine. There are plenty of
little features and improvements I can make to it that have been really fun to
pair on with other people, though, and it&#39;s nice to work on something that&#39;s
immediately and actually useful to me.</p>
<h2 id="meet-my-cohort">Meet my cohort</h2>
<p>This has taken up a lot of my time and with good reason. Again, and just like
the first time, there&#39;s just a stunning array of different people with all
sorts of backgrounds. I&#39;ve already learned about so many things I had never
heard of before! here&#39;s a sample:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_computing">reservoir computing</a>, which is extremely cyberpunk</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal">NAT traversal</a> in the context of peer-to-peer discovery techniques and related to...</li>
<li><a href="https://hazelcast.com/glossary/distributed-hash-table/">distributed hash tables</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum">prefix sums</a> and a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20477177/creating-an-array-of-cumulative-sum-in-javascript/55261098#55261098">clever way</a> to computer them </li>
</ul>
<p>One thing I love about RC is that it&#39;s an extremely safe place to say &#34;I don&#39;t
know.&#34; This is <a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-feigning-surprise">not
accidental</a> and
should be expected when people are coming from such different starting points,
but committing to it as a principle can yield fantastic results.</p>
<h2 id="start-collecting-resources">Start collecting resources</h2>
<p>This one wasn&#39;t really on the list to begin with but as I&#39;ve gone through the
week I&#39;ve encountered so many links to resources that look worth investing time
in that I&#39;m trying to make a point of cataloging them to come back to later.
I&#39;ll collect them at the end of my weekly recaps starting with this one. Here
are some:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://thebookofshaders.com/">The Book of Shaders</a></li>
<li><a href="http://concrete-semantics.org/">Concrete Semantics</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bigmachine.io/products/a-curious-moon/">A Curious Moon</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/">Git from the Bottom Up</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain">The Programmer&#39;s Brain</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXnXUH5AhKU">Strange Loop Chat with Felienne Hermans about &#34;The Programmer&#39;s Brain&#34;</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CKru5d4GPk">Spreadsheets for developers</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1ib43q3uXQ">How to teach programming (and other things)?</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="next-week">Next week</h2>
<p>My intention next week is to start on some more substantial projects I have in
mind, with a real emphasis on writing one to throw away. I want to <em>produce a
lot of code</em>. This was not the focus of this week and that&#39;s what I had planned
but starting next week I want to do more hands on keyboard hacking.</p>
<p>I also want to pair a lot with other people&#39;s projects. These days are long but
the &#34;most people getting online in my afternoon&#34; thing is actually quite useful
for splitting the day up- I have hours in the morning and early afternoon for
focus time. It&#39;s not a sustainable model to work from 9-9 every day, but this
isn&#39;t really &#34;work&#34;, I take lots of breaks, and it&#39;s only a short period, so...
so far so good. Ask me in 3 weeks.</p>
