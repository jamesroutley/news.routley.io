<p>I recently moved into a new apartment which I used as an opportunity to make our home a little smarter.
As a big open source supporter I built my smart home platform with <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> of course.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are still far too few products that are directly compatible with Home Assistant.
Especially in the area of humidifiers where I only found products that rely on a proprietary app or cloud from the manufacturer.
Something that I would like to avoid at all costs.
For one thing, such dependence is a certain form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence">planned obsolescence</a>, as the product becomes useless as soon as the app loses its compatibility with new smartphone operating system versions or the manufacturer’s cloud is no longer operated.</p>
