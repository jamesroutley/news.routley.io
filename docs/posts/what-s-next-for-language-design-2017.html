    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Largely I think that text is already a highly-structured graphical notation, and that when people try to get &#34;away&#34; from it they&#39;re often doing so from a position of ignorance of how very long it took to get to where we are in textual notations, and how very many technical innovations are latent <em>in</em> textual notations. Visually unambiguous yet uniform symbol sets, combinatorial-positional word formation, linear spatio-temporal segregation, punctuation and structured page layout .. these are all <em>technologies</em> in writing that we had to laboriously invent, and they have purposes, advantages! Similarly in coding, we had to <em>invent and adapt</em> technologies from verbal and mathematical notations refined over millennia: lines and columns, indentation, block layout, juxtaposition and precedence, scope, evaluation order, comments, grammars, version control, diff and merge algorithms ... the pile of <em>structuring technologies</em> embedded in the textual representation of programs isn&#39;t free, and it isn&#39;t useless. So I&#39;m just really cautious when people suggest throwing it all out for some hypothetical reinvention. You need those structures: so you&#39;ve got an immediate problem of &#34;what are you going to use instead&#34;, and a longer-term question of &#34;what makes you think you&#39;re not going to wind up right back at the same place ten thousand years of refining graphemes-on-a-page wound up&#34;?</p></div></div>
