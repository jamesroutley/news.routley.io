    <h1>Microsoft at Work</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>I haven&#39;t written anything for a bit. I&#39;m not apologizing, because y&#39;all don&#39;t
pay me enough to apologize, but I do feel a little bad. Part of it is just that
I&#39;ve been busy, with work and travel and events. Part of it is that I&#39;ve
embarked on a couple of writing projects only to have them just Not Work Out.
It happens sometimes: I&#39;ll notice something interesting, spend an evening or
two digging into it, but find that I just can&#39;t make a story out of it. There
isn&#39;t enough information; it&#39;s not really that interesting; the original source
turned out to just be wrong. Well, this one is a bit of all three. Join me, if
you will, on a journey to nowhere in particular.</p>
<p>One of the things I am interested in is embedded real-time operating systems.
Another thing I am interested in is Unified Communications. Yet another is
failed Microsoft research projects. So if you&#39;ve ever heard of Microsoft At
Work, you probably won&#39;t be surprised that it has repeatedly caught my eye.
Most likely, you haven&#39;t heard of it. Few have; even the normal sources of
information on these kinds of things appear to be inaccurate or at least
confused about the details.</p>
<p>Microsoft went to work in the summer of 1993, or at least that&#39;s when they
announced Microsoft At Work. This kind of terrible product naming was rampant
in the mid-&#39;90s, perhaps more from Microsoft than usual. MAW, as I and a few
others call it, was marketed with a healthy dose of software sales obfuscation.
What was it, exactly? an Architecture, Microsoft said. It would enable all
kinds of new applications. With MAW, one would be able to seamlessly access the
wealth of information on their personal computers. Some reporters called it an
Environment. Try this for a lede: &#34;Microsoft Corp. unveils integrated computer
program.&#34;</p>
<p>The announcement included a demo that got a lot more to the point: a fax
machine that ran Windows.</p>
<p>Even this was strangely obfuscated: enough newspaper reports described it as a
&#34;fax like product&#34; that I think this verbiage was sincerely used in the
announcement. Today, we would refer to MAW as an effort towards &#34;smart&#34; office
machines, but in 1993 we hadn&#39;t quite learned that vocabulary yet. Microsoft
must have been worried that it would be dismissed as &#34;just a fax machine.&#34; It
couldn&#39;t be that, it had to be something more. It had to be a &#34;fax like
product,&#34; built with &#34;Windows architecture.&#34;</p>
<p>I am being a bit dismissive for effect. MAW was more ambitious than just
installing Windows on a grape. The effort included a unified communications
protocol for the control of office machines, including printers, for which
a whole Microsoft stack was envisioned. This built on top of the Windows
Printing System, a difficult-to-search-for project that apparently predated
MAW by a short time, enough so that Windows Printing System products were
actually on the market when MAW was announced---MAW products were, we will
learn, very much not.</p>
<p>Windows Printing System modules were sold for at least the HP LaserJet II and
III. If you did not experience them, these printers placed their actual
rasterization logic onto a modular card that could be swapped out, usually to
switch between PCL or PostScript &#34;personalities.&#34; The PostScript module was
offered mostly for MacOS compatibility, Apple having selected PostScript as a
common printer control language. The Windows Printing System module took this
operating system specialization a step further, using Windows&#39; simple GDI
graphics protocol to draw output to the printer.</p>
<p>I am actually a little unclear on whether or not the Windows Printing System
lead directly to the cheap &#34;WinPrinters&#34; that are also associated with the idea
of GDI-based printing. &#34;WinPrinters,&#34; so-called by analogy to WinModems, are
entirely dependent on the host computer to perform rasterization. While
extremely irritating from the perspective of software support, this was an
important cost-savings measure in consumer printers. Executing a capable
printer control language was rather demanding; the Apple LaserWriter famously
had a faster processor than the Macintosh computers it was a peripheral to.
Printers with independent rasterization, particularly the more complex
PostScript, came at a substantial price premium to those that required the host
to perform rasterization.</p>
<p>While some details of reporting on the Windows Printing System make me worry
that it was in fact rasterizing on device (like the curiously specific limit of
&#34;up to 79&#34; TrueType fonts), I&#39;m fairly sure it was indeed a precursor to the
later inexpensive designs. Rather than a cost-savings measure, though,
Microsoft seems to have marketed it as a premium feature. Because of the
Windows Printing System&#39;s higher level of integration with the operating
system, it brought numerous new features, many of which we take for granted
today. TrueType font support at all, for example, a cutting-edge feature in
&#39;93. Duplex control from the print dialog rather than the printer&#39;s own
display, and for that matter, the ability to see printer status messages (like
&#34;PC LOAD LETTER&#34;) on the computer you just printed from.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, offloading rasterization from the printer had an
advantage: the Windows Printing System was faster than PCL or PostScript.</p>
<p>Even if it did become the dominant printing method years later, the Windows
Printing System of the MAW era doesn&#39;t seem to have fared very well. Because it
took the position of an add-on cartridge (like a font cartridge), it would have
been an added-cost option for printer buyers---an added cost of $132.99,
according to a period advertisement. The dearth of available documentation or
even post-launch advertising for the Windows Printing System cartridge suggests
disappointing sales numbers.</p>
<p>The fortunes of Windows Printing Technology would turn a year later, though, as
Lexmark introduced their WinWriter series: &#34;With the Microsoft Windows Printing
System Built In!&#34; Speaking of the Lexmark WinWriter series, this whole printing
thing is kind of a tangent. What about MAW? The Windows Printing System, it
seems, was not really a part of MAW. It was just generally related and available
when MAW was announced, so it was rolled into the press conference. It is a bit
ironic that the Lexmark WinWriter, truly the Printer for Windows, was <em>not</em> a
MAW device despite shipping well after MAW was announced.</p>
<p>So, back to the course: MAW was not just Windows on a fax machine, not just the
Windows Printing System, but an integrated system of Windows on a fax machine,
the Windows Printing System, a generalized network protocol, and apparently a
page description language. This was all, as you can see, rather
document-focused. MAW would allow Windows users to easily, seamlessly interact
with these common office machines, sending and receiving documents like it was
1999.</p>
<p>And later, it would do more: Microsoft was clear from the beginning that MAW
had a higher vision, one that is remarkably similar to the later concept of
Unified Communications. Microsoft envisioned Windows on a <em>phone,</em> bringing
desk phones into the same architecture, or environment, or whatever. Remember
the phone part, it comes back.</p>
<p>In practice, MAW would do nothing. It was a complete and total failure. It took
two years for the first MAW office machine to reach the market, a Ricoh fax
machine. Fortunately, a <a href="https://vimeo.com/111038922">television commercial</a>
has been preserved, giving us a small window into the Windows on a Fax Machine
experience. &#34;Microsoft&#39;s At Work Still Loafing on the Job,&#34; is how the
Washington Post put it in 1995.</p>
<p>They call it &#34;the first real step toward the paperless digital office,&#34; a nod
towards the promise of Microsoft&#39;s document-messaging vision, before noting
that virtually no products had shipped, everything was behind schedule, and
Microsoft had reorganized the At Work team out of existence. Microsoft At Work
was seldom spoken of again.  Few products ever launched, those that did sold
poorly (the Windows licensing fee imposed on them being one of several factors
contributing to noncompetitive price tags), and by the time Windows gained
proper USB support few would remember it had ever happened.</p>
<p>In other words, a classic Microsoft story.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m not here to chronicle Microsoft&#39;s foibles, there are other writers
for that. I&#39;m here to chronicle their weird operating system projects. And
that&#39;s what got me reading into MAW: the  promise of not just one, but <em>two</em>
weird operating system projects.</p>
<p>Regard that promise with suspicion.</p>
<p>Wikipedia tells us that MAW included &#34;Microsoft At Work Operating System, a
small RTOS to be embedded in devices.&#34; That&#39;s very interesting. I love a small
RTOS to be embedded in devices! Tell us more.</p>
<p>Researching this MAW embedded operating system turns out to be a challenge. You
see, it is not the better known of the operating systems produced by the MAW
initiative. That would be WinPad, curiously not mentioned at all in the MAW
Wikipedia article, but instead in the Windows CE article, as a precursor to CE.
Windows CE gets a lot more affection than MAW, and so we know quite a bit more
about WinPad. It was an early attempt at an operating system for a touchscreen
mobile device, one that, in classic Microsoft fashion, competed internally with
<em>another</em> project to build an operating system for a touchscreen mobile device
(called Pegasus) and died out along with the rest of MAW.</p>
<p>It was based on 16-bit Windows 3.1, using a stripped-down UI layer that
resembled Windows 95. Probably not coincidentally, there seems to have been an
effort to port WinPad onto Windows 95, and fortunately developer releases of
WinPad have been preserved. With some effort, you can get them running on top
of appropriate Windows versions in an emulator.</p>
<p>WinPad was envisioned as a core part of MAW, the key enabler of that paperless
office. With MAW and WinPad, you could synchronize documents, emails, and
faxes, everything you could ever want in 1995, onto your handheld device and
then carry it with you. WinPad also didn&#39;t work. Evidently the performance was
lousy and it required entirely unrealistic battery capacities. Not a surprising
outcome when one ports a mid-&#39;90s desktop operating system to a tablet. How
charming! But not exactly my target. What about this RTOS?</p>
<p>If you dig into these things for too long, you start to question your life, or
at least reality. References to this MAW embedded operating system are so
sparse that I quickly started to wonder if it existed at all, or if it was
simply confused with WinPad. This MAW OS would run directly on the office
machines. Is it possible that it was, in fact, WinPad that ran on a fax
machine?  Or at least that whatever ran on the fax machine was a direct
precursor to WinPad, an earlier new UI layer on top of 16-bit Windows?</p>
<p>The nagging thing that kept me on the hunt for this MAW embedded OS was, oddly
enough, the Sega Saturn. A series of newspaper archives, many gathered by
<a href="https://mdshock.com/2020/06/22/sega-and-microsoft-announce-partnership-for-saturn-os/">Mega Drive
Shock</a>,
tell an interesting story. Microsoft, it seemed, had been contracted to provide
the operating system for the Sega Saturn. Well, this seems to have been a
misconception, although clearly a period one. As the news cycle carried on, the
scope of this Microsoft-Sega partnership (at first denied by Microsoft!) was
reduced to Microsoft providing some sort of firmware related to the Saturn&#39;s
CD drive.</p>
<p>There is, though, a tantalizing detail. The <em>Electronics Times</em> reported that
&#34;Microsoft looks set to port its Microsoft At Work operating system to
Hitachi&#39;s new SH series of microprocessors.&#34; The article explicitly linked
the porting to the Saturn effort, but also mentioned that the MAW operating
system was being ported to Motorola 68000.</p>
<p>Do you know what never ran on the Hitachi SH or Super-H architecture? 16-bit
Windows.</p>
<p>Do you know what did? Windows CE.</p>
<p>Is it possible? Do you think? Is Windows CE a derivative of Windows for Fax
Machines?</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure the answer is no. A reader pointed me at John Murray&#39;s 1998
book <em>Inside Windows CE,</em> which provides a brief and presumably authoritative
history of the platform. It specifically discusses Windows CE as a follow-on
project to the failed WinPad, which it describes as 16-bit Windows 3.1, and
goes on to say it &#34;was designed for office equipment such as copiers and fax
machines.&#34;</p>
<p>It is, of course, possible that the book is incorrect. But given the dearth
of references to this MAW embedded RTOS, I think this is the more likely
scenario:</p>
<p>MAW devices like the Ricoh IFS77 ran 16-bit Windows 3.1 with a new GUI intended
to appear more modern while reducing resource requirements. Some reporters at
the time noted that Microsoft was cagey about the supported architectures, I
suspect they were waiting on ports to be completed. The fax machine was
probably x86, though, as there&#39;s little evidence MAW actually ran on anything
else.</p>
<p>This operating system was extended for the WinPad project, and efforts were
made to port it to architectures more common in the embedded devices of the
time like SH and 68000. Microsoft may have reached some level of completion on
that project and sold it to Sega for the Saturn&#39;s complicated storage
controller, but it&#39;s also possible that the connection between the Saturn and
MAW is mistaken and the software Microsoft delivered to Sega was a simple,
from-scratch effort. The strange arc of media reporting on the Microsoft-Sega
relationship offers the tantalizing possibility that Microsoft was intended to
deliver a complete OS for the Saturn but had to pare it back as a result of
problems with porting WinPad, but it seems more likely it just results from an
overeager electronics industry press and the Sega NDA that a Microsoft
spokesperson admitted to being subject to.</p>
<p>MAW failed to win the market, and WinPad failed to win a BillG review. The
project was canceled. From the ashes of WinPad and the similarly failed
Pegasus, some of the same people started work on a brand new project, Pulsar,
which would become Windows CE.</p>
<p>MAW didn&#39;t survive the &#39;90s.</p>
<p>Well, some things are like that. I still got 240 lines out of it.</p>
<p>Update: Alert reader abrasive (James Wah) writes in that they had previously
dumped the CD-ROM firmware from the Saturn and performed some reverse
engineering. Several things suggest that it was not developed by Microsoft,
including a Hitachi copyright notice. It seems likely, then, that the
supposed Microsoft-Sega partnership never produced anything or was never
real in the first place.</p>
