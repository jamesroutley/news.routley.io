    <h1>Cut the cutesy errors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>I had to get a train ticket today, which is a two-step process. First I buy the ticket, then I download an e-ticket with a QR code that I scan at the gates. Normally this works fine, and I buy the ticket on my way to the station. Today, Trainline had other ideas:</p> <p><img src="https://alexwlchan.net/images/2022/guest_headers_2x.png" srcset="/images/2022/guest_headers_2x.png 2x, /images/2022/guest_headers_1x.png 1x" alt="An error message dialog. ‘This is awkward. Token not provided in guest headers.’"/></p> <p>They could take my money! They just couldn’t give me a ticket.</p> <p>Frustrating as this was, it was made far worse by the error message.</p> <p><em>“This is awkward”</em> is what you say when two people show up to a party in the same outfit; this was far more than that. I was worried that I was about to miss my train, and annoyed at having to buy a replacement ticket – and the cutesy error message felt like somebody was trivialising my troubles.</p> <p>And the explanatory text is completely useless: <em>“Token not provided in guest headers.”</em> I have no idea what this means, or what I can do about it. Will it work if I try again? Do I have a ticket for my return journey? Should I call support? Or is this ticket completely hosed?</p> <p><strong>Be very careful about humourous error messages.</strong> You need to think about how somebody will be feeling when something goes wrong. What seems fun and light-hearted in your office may read very differently when you’ve just ruined somebody’s day.</p> <p>There are certain classes of app where an unexpected error can cause a lot of stress: transport, telephony, and finance all spring to mind. Imagine someone who’s just missed a plane, had an important call cut out, or can’t get money out of their bank account. How are they feeling? Will they appreciate your attempt at humour?</p> <p>There’s a place for humour and levity in software, and my code has plenty – but error messages are rarely it. <strong>If somebody hits an error, they’re some mix of anxious, angry, or confused, and cute or unclear language does nothing to help.</strong></p> <p>Error messages are <a href="https://alexwlchan.net/2020/10/the-importance-of-good-error-messages/">incredibly important</a>, and the software industry generally does a bad job of writing them. Good error messages explain what’s gone wrong, and give clear instructions for what to do next – and being cutesy rarely helps.</p> <p><em>This post was adapted from <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwlchan/status/1554723537562357760">a thread on Twitter</a>.</em></p> </article></div>
