</div><p>A huge megalithic complex of more than 500 standing stones has been discovered in southern Spain which could be one of the largest in Europe, archaeologists told AFP Thursday.

                                                                                    <p>The stones were discovered on a plot of land in Huelva, a province which flanks the southernmost part of Spain&#39;s border with Portugal, near the Guadiana River. </p>
<p>Spanning some 600 hectares (1,500 acres), the land had been earmarked for an avocado planation. </p>
<p>But before granting the permit, the regional authorities requested a survey in light of the site&#39;s possible archaeological significance—and revealed the presence of the stones. </p>
<p>&#34;This is the biggest and most diverse collection of <a href="https://phys.org/tags/standing+stones/" rel="tag">standing stones</a> grouped together in the Iberian peninsula,&#34; said Jose Antonio Linares, a researcher at Huelva University and one of the project&#39;s three directors. </p>
<p>It is likely that the oldest standing stones at the La Torre-La Janera site were erected during the second half of the sixth or fifth millennium BC, he said. </p>
<p>&#34;It is a major megalithic site in Europe,&#34; he said. </p>
<p>At the site, they found a large number of various types of megaliths, including standing stones, dolmens, mounds, coffin-like stone boxes called cists and various enclosures. </p>
<p>&#34;Standing stones were the most common finding, with 526 of them still standing or lying on the ground,&#34; said the researchers in an article published in Trabajos de Prehistoria, a prehistoric archaeology journal in the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
<p>The height of the stones was between one and three metres (3-10 feet). </p>
<p><b>&#39;Excellently conserved&#39;</b></p>
<p>At Carnac in northwestern France, which is one of the most famous megalithic sites in the world, there are some 3,000 standing stones. </p>
<p>One of the most striking things was finding such diverse megalithic elements grouped together in one location and how well preserved they were, said Primitiva Bueno, co-director of the project and a prehistory professor at Alcala University near Madrid. </p>
<p>&#34;Finding alignments and dolmens on one site is not very common,&#34; she told AFP.</p>
<p>&#34;Here you find everything all together: alignments, cromlechs and dolmens and that is very striking,&#34; she said, hailing the site&#39;s &#34;excellent conservation&#34;. </p>
<p>An alignment is a linear arrangement of upright standing stones along a common axis, while a cromlech is a stone circle and a dolmen is a type of megalithic tomb usually made of two or more standing stones with a large flat &#39;capstone&#39; on top. </p>
<p>Most of the menhirs were grouped into 26 alignments and two cromlechs, both located on hilltops with a clear view to the east for viewing the sunrise during the summer and winter solstices and the spring and autumn equinoxes, the researchers said. </p>
<p>Many of the stones are buried deep in the earth.</p>
<p>They will need to be carefully excavated with the work scheduled to run until 2026 but &#34;between this year&#39;s campaign and the start of next year&#39;s, there will be a part of the site that can be visited&#34;, Bueno said.
