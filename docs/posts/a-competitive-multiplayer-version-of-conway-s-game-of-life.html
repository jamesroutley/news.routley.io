                <p>This is a multiplayer version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway&#39;s Game of Life</a>.</p>
                <p>Players compete for space on the board. The leaderboard shows the players that occupied the most cells on the board at one time.</p>
                <p>When an empty cell comes to life because it is a neighbor to three cells of multiple players, the new cell is assigned to the player occupying two of the three surrounding cells.</p>
                <p>All players with fewer than twelve cells available to place receive an extra one every six generations.</p>
