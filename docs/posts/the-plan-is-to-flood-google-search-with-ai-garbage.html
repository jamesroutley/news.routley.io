    <h1>The plan is to flood Google search with AI garbage</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The plan is to flood Google search with AI garbage. It is not a secret plan.</p><p>Seriously, no one’s being all that shy about it! Here’s G/O Media editorial director Merrill Brown to Peter Kafka about that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/6/23785645/go-media-ai-generated-articles-gizmodo-av-club-artificial-intelligence-bots">AI-written list of Star Wars movies in chronological order</a> that wasn’t actually in chronological order (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p>And for at least a few days, Google ranked Gizmodo’s machine-made output among the top results for “star wars movies” queries. That’s something Brown noted when he told me that <strong>he’s learned that AI content “will, at least for the moment, be well-received by search engines.”</strong></p></blockquote><p>All these media companies keep saying they’re using AI <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23794986/news-media-ai-experiments-chatgpt-go-media-cnet">because they need to learn more about it</a>, but surprise — the only thing they’re learning is that they can get even cheaper, shittier traffic than before.</p><br/></div></div>
