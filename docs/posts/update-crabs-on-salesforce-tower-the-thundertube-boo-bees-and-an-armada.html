    <h1>Update - Crabs on Salesforce Tower, The Thundertube, Boo Bees, and an Armada</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><nav></nav><section><div id="crabs-on-salesforce-tower"><h3>Crabs on Salesforce Tower</h3></div><p><img alt="crabs floating in space" src="https://aaronstrick.com/images/projects/crab-tower/seo.jpg"/></p><p>I put together a proposal to show some artwork at the top of salesforce tower. It wasn&#39;t accepted, but I&#39;m proud of it.</p><ul><li><a href="https://tower-crab.aaronstrick.com/" target="_blank">The Proposal</a> (What I actually submitted.)</li></ul><ul><li><a href="https://aaronstrick.com/projects/tower-crab">The Project Page</a> (I feel like there coulda/shoulda/woulda been a &#34;using react to make videos of swirling space crab&#39;s&#34; tutorial, but... I&#39;m not great at showing my work.)</li></ul><div id="the-thundertube-lives-on-"><h3>The Thundertube lives on!!</h3></div><p><img alt="the thundertube" src="https://aaronstrick.com/images/projects/thundertube/seo.jpg"/></p><p>In 2018, with some other recursers, I put together an LED livecoding installation inside the new Brooklyn space for the <a href="https://recurse.com" target="_blank">Recurse Center</a>. I learned recently, now that the space has re-opened, that the project has been revitalized! I made an update here on aaronstrick.com accordingly.</p><ul><li><a href="https://aaronstrick.com/projects/thundertube">The Thundertube Project</a></li></ul><p>This was actually many months ago, but on May 30th of this year, I was featured on the <a href="https://elmtown.simplecast.com/" target="_blank">Elm Town</a> podcast. I didn&#39;t make an update, because it was actually a pretty emotional experience. I&#39;ve gotten a lot from the elm community over the years, and the episode caused me to have a lot of reflections. I&#39;ve written many of them down, but haven&#39;t yet hit publish. I hope to soon.</p><ul><li><a href="https://elmtown.simplecast.com/episodes/elm-town-57-brilliant-ways-to-use-elm" target="_blank">My Episode (#57)</a></li></ul><p>I had a New Years resolution to release 12 songs. It&#39;s November, and I&#39;m sad to report that these are numbers 2 and 3 for the year. But hey -- it beats last year, and I have a full time job and a toddler! I think I have at least one more in me before the year is up!</p><p>I&#39;m in a group chat with some friends called the Men With Dogs Armada. We all have dogs and we all like to go in boats. If you listen carefully, everyone&#39;s dog is mentioned as an easter egg in this song. Pilot, Dusty, Trouble, Patches, and Lilo.</p><div><h3>The Armada Rides</h3><p><audio controls="true"><source src="/songs/the-armada-rides.mp3"/>Your browser does not support the audio tag</audio></p></div><p>For Halloween, I was invited to a &#34;portmanteau&#34; themed party. I decided to go very basic, and frankly, pretty immature. I was &#34;boobees&#34;. This song went along with my costume... which... was also a very fun project. Smart Wearables!!</p><div><h3>Boo Bees</h3><p><audio controls="true"><source src="/songs/boobees.mp3"/>Your browser does not support the audio tag</audio></p></div><p><img alt="boobees" src="https://aaronstrick.com/images/updates/boobees.jpg"/></p><p>Added a new &#34;<a href="https://aaronstrick.com/posts/forever-goofin">blog post</a>&#34;. I don&#39;t do much writing in this style, so it&#39;s exciting to me.</p></section></div></div>
