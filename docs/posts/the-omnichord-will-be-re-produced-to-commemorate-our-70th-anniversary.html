		<h3>What is Omnichord</h3><p>
		It was developed as an electronic musical instrument with an automatic accompaniment function (auto bass chord) equipped with a harp sensor. Anyone can easily play chords, including those who are new to musical instruments and those who are less adept with traditional  instruments. It is played using multiple chord buttons lined up in the centre and a touch sensitive strum plate on the right. Whilst pressing the chord buttons, tap the plate with your finger or slide up and down to play 4 octave sounds to effectively accompany a song. Not only is it easy to play, but its unique appearance and tone makes it a hidden favorite both in Japan and overseas for artists who want to try something different and for non-musicians who want to play music!		</p></div>

		<h3>History of the Omnichord</h3><p>
		Originally development started with a request from an overseas sales company to make an electronic musical instrument like an auto-harp. It started with the electronic musical instrument &#39;PC-27&#39; and the first Omnichord &#39;OM-27&#39; was born with improvements to the interface and functions. Since then, as technology has advanced, we have created numerous models through trial and error in adding more chords, timbres, and designs.		</p></div>

Please listen to the performance that combines the tones and chords introduced so far! </span><span>A disco funk pattern is also installed for the first time as an Omnichord.</span><strong><span><br/></span></strong>		</p></div>
