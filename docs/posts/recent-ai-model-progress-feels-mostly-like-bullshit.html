    <h1>Recent AI model progress feels mostly like bullshit</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Happy April!</p>
<p>March is out the door, and it went by so fast.</p>
<p>Some updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>I did some research on publishing to make sure my understandings of cost and shipping times and things still line up with the research I did in... 2022. It does! So that&#39;s great.</li>
<li>I wrote 3843 words in March. This is a net change, so very possible I wrote more, but I deleted others.</li>
<li>I migrated my work from Markdown to Typst. It seemed like a better format for working towards printing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a shorter update this month, thank you all for the support. If there are certain things you would like to see in these updates, please let me know!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
