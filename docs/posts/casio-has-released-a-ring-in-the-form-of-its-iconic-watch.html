    <h1>Casio has released a ring in the form of its iconic watch</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Not to be outdone by its longtime rival, Casio has announced its own digital ring watch that brings more functionality than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278580/timexs-new-digital-ring-watch-actually-tells-time">Timex’s wearable</a> that debuted last month. Created to help commemorate the 50th anniversary of Casio getting into the digital watch business, the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.casio.com%2Fjp%2Fwatches%2Fcasio%2Fproduct.CRW-001-1%2F">CRW-001-1JR</a> will be available in Japan starting in December for ￥19,800, or around $128.</p><p>Although the tiny watch’s case is just shy of being an inch in size, Casio has managed to squeeze in a retro six-segment LCD screen that can display hours, minutes, and seconds. The ring also includes three functional buttons that can control additional features like displaying the date or the time in a different time zone, and a stopwatch.</p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A close-up showing details of the Casio CRW-001-1JR digital ring watch." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><div><figcaption><em>Casio’s new digital ring watch has a case and bezel made of polished stainless steel.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Casio</cite></p></div></div></div><p>The ring watch’s screen even has a light, and an alarm function that will flash the display instead of playing an audible sound. It’s powered by a single battery that Casio says will keep the waterproof watch running for about two years but is also easily replaceable when it does die.</p><div><div><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Casio’s digital ring watch upgraded with included spacers to fit smaller fingers." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill"/></span></p></div></figure></div></div><div><figcaption><em>The ring watch’s size isn’t adjustable, so Casio includes spacers to fit smaller fingers.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Casio</cite></p></div></div></div><p>To accurately recreate the design and intricate details of the larger digital watches the ring is based on, Casio says the wearable is manufactured as a single piece using a metal injection molding process that starts with powdered metal. As a result, unlike Timex’s watch ring that <a href="https://timex.com/products/timex-x-mm6-20mm-stainless-steel-ring-watch-m-l-tw2w81400">features a stretchable band</a> to accommodate different users, the CRW-001-1JR is permanently a US size 10.5. If your fingers are smaller than that, Casio includes a couple of spacers to improve the fit. If your fingers are larger than that, you’ll need to find some other way to check the time.</p><p>Last year, Casio <a href="https://www.g-central.com/casio-to-release-casio-watch-ring-collection-capsule-toys/#google_vignette">released a collection of ring watches</a> featuring designs inspired by some of the company’s most iconic digital timepieces from the past 50 years. Unfortunately, none of them were functional, so it’s nice to see Casio following up with a ring watch that actually works. For the 75th anniversary, maybe we’ll even get a tiny calculator ring watch.</p></div></div></div>
