<b>News</b><p><b>For BSD Unix, It&#39;s Sayonara </b></p>

<p>June 22, 1992</p>
<p>Berkeley, Calif. -- The end of a major computing era will come next month 
when the final release of BSD Unix gets shipped, marking the University of 
California at Berkeley&#39;s withdrawal from the operating system business. </p>
<p>A lack of funding and the increasing sophistication of commercial Unix 
implementations have combined to halt Unix development at the university, 
meaning that 4.4BSD Unix-set to go Alpha by next month, with general 
availability by December-will be Berkeley&#39;s last OS. </p>
<p>BSD has been popular in the academic community for many reasons, mostly 
because-since 1988-it has not required a license fee and often features 
cutting-edge technology years before commercial computer vendors&#39; versions. </p>
<p>&#34;With any commercial version of Unix, you usually have to sign your life 
away,&#34; said Evi Nemeth, an associate professor of computer science at the 
University of Colorado at Boulder, adding that this no-license feature made BSD 
ideal for teaching students about operating systems and networking. </p>
<p>BSD Unix was responsible for much of the Unix innovation during the 1980s and 
came into being around 1978 when Berkeley graduate student Bill Joy added 
virtual memory capability to a VAX 11/780 port of Unix. The resulting system was 
named 3BSD (4BSD in 1980) and became the dominant Unix version at universities.
</p>
<p>Since that time, nearly all of the important Unix enhancements have come from 
the BSD releases of Unix. Collectively, these enhancements are often referred to 
as the Berkeley &#34;extensions&#34; and are now part of System V Release 4. The 
programming API for OSF/1 is based on 4.3BSD libraries and system calls. </p>
<p>Originally, BSD was funded by the government through DARPA. But that funding 
was cut off in 1988 when the vendor community started to show a strong interest 
in doing its own development. </p>
<p>Since 1988, BSD research and staffing has been supplied through vendor 
grants, mostly from Hewlett-Packard, the Open Software Foundation and Cray 
Research. </p>
<p>Kirk McKusick, the Berkeley research computer scientist who is in charge of 
the BSD project, added that NASA Ames also has been a major sponsor. </p>
<p>&#34;It&#39;s becoming increasingly difficult to get funding from the private 
sector,&#34; he said. &#34;With the recession, these companies are obviously looking at 
the bottom line and external research is an item that can be easily reduced.&#34;
</p>
<p>While fund raising has gotten more difficult, today&#39;s technology has forced 
the operating system to grow substantially more complicated, with the 100 
different commands from a few years ago now at 500 commands, McKusick said. </p>
<p>&#34;The complexity has grown almost exponentially,&#34; he said, adding that his 
staff of four would need be doubled to &#34;continue the level of quality.&#34; </p>
<p>Also, McKusick said, the university itself &#34;is not as interested in having us 
around as they did 10 years ago&#34; because vendors today-such as Cisco 
Systems-have packaged some of the networking technology that made his team so 
indispensable before for systems administration. </p>
<p>&#34;We are so good at getting our stuff disseminated that we are no longer 
needed,&#34; he said. </p>
<p>Another factor contributing to the OS&#39; demise, said Keith Bostic, fellow 
Berkeley programmer and the project&#39;s second-in-command, was the increasing 
sophistication of vendors in working with Unix. </p>
<p>In the early 1980s, Bostic said, just about the entire Unix community was 
either using a form of BSD or AT&amp;T&#39;s System V. &#34;If you bought {Unix} from DEC, 
you were running BSD. If you bought {Unix} from Sun, you were running BSD,&#34; he 
said. &#34;In today&#39;s climate, it is not the same as 1980.&#34; </p>
<p>Bostic said that today&#39;s Unix vendors are more sophisticated and are making 
many more changes to whatever version of Unix they are starting with. </p>
<p>BSD 4.3 &#34;was the last version that major vendors shipped right out of the 
box. Vendors now tend to pick and choose,&#34; he said. &#34;The vendors are basically 
going to lose a research group.&#34; </p>
<p>There are still options to secure BSD code, with one company, Berkeley 
Software Design (Falls Church, Va.), a company employing former Berkeley 
programmer Mike Karels, planning to offer a commercial version of Unix for SPARC 
systems based on the 4.4BSD code but free of AT&amp;T source licensing requirements. 
It currently offers BSD/386, a version of Unix for 386 machines based on the 
Berkeley NET2 release. </p>
<p>And there are several outfits that will distribute the code freely, often 
directly on the net. </p>
<p>The University of Colorado&#39;s Nemeth, regarded as an expert on Unix security 
and perhaps best known for having co-authored the Unix System Administration 
Handbook, said last week that she would like to have her university conduct some 
of the operating system research that Berkeley is now abandoning. </p>
<p>One of the most popular accomplishments of the BSD team, said Nemeth and 
others, was its sifting through mountains of software out in the industry, 
finding the best examples and incorporating them into a BSD version. McKusick 
said it was often a matter of convincing contributors &#34;that they would rather 
have fame than fortune.&#34; </p>
<p>Nemeth cited a more colorful-and oft-cited-description: &#34;It was a matter of 
their taking it in and peeing on it until it smelled like Berkeley.&#34; </p>
<p>&#34;This is a valuable function and the community needs the service,&#34; she said, 
adding that she is trying to convince DARPA to resume funding BSD research at 
her university with it paying for three to four full-time staff, two or three 
graduate students and two or three undergraduate students. Nemeth estimated that 
she would need about $700,000. </p>
<p>But she said last week that she now is leaning toward securing interim 
funding from industry, in an attempt to demonstrate to DARPA that her people can 
do the job effectively. </p>
<p>Nemeth said that she is hesitant, though, to have vendor support made 
permanent. &#34;I don&#39;t see having to constantly hustle for money.&#34;</p>
