    <h1>Ask HN: Firing an employee under a month before vest?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;m the founder of an early stage startup, around 10 employees.</p><p>One of those (one of the first to join) has been an issue for quite a while. Lots of time off, low effort at work, minimal hours. Felt like squeezing water out of a stone to get a result from them.</p><p>Recently, their behavior has gotten worse despite feedback. Taking off without informing team. Found out a lot of past work was plain wrong.</p><p>They vest in a few weeks. I don&#39;t want to have them on the team anymore, I&#39;m done trying and this employee is negatively affecting me and the company.</p><p>Should I let them vest then let them go, or just let them go? Feedback from former founders esp is helpful. Any downsides to having them on the cap table?</p></div></div></div>
