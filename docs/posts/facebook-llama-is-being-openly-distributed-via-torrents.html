      <p>I find it hard to talk about the work that I’m doing at feenk,
working on <a href="https://gtoolkit.com/">Glamorous Toolkit</a>, in the “dead”
medium of a blog post. Consequently, I haven’t written much about
anything I’ve done in a long, long while.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean I haven’t done stuff, however! To prove it—and to
bridge the gap until I can figure out how to write about things in a
more “live” fashion that better suits my current work—here’s a recording
of a talk I gave on a Carp IDE I implemented in a few weekends in
Glamorous Toolkit. It’s from last year, but the recording only became
available two weeks ago.</p>

<p>I have some other things I want to talk about, however, and that I
know how to present if I find the time to do so. So maybe I’ll finally
write a real blog post again soon? No promises, though.</p>
