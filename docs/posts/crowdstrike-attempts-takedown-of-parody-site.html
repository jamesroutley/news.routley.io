    <h1>CrowdStrike attempts takedown of parody site</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
<p>Neat! We made the top of Hacker News!</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.cscglobal.com/cscglobal/home/">Clown Services Company</a> is a company used by companies like CrowdStrike to submit bogus takedowns and commit cyberbullying.</p>
<p><img src="https://clownstrike.lol/crowdmad/csc-logo-full.webp" alt=""/></p>
<p>It seems as though CrowdStrike is not exactly a fan of this site, understandable‚Ä¶ it is a parody site after all‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Don‚Äôt worry though! They will definitely solve all their problems by sending a baseless takedown notice to CloudFlare! (sarcasm)</p>
<p><img src="https://clownstrike.lol/crowdmad/clowdstrike-resp1.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, I don‚Äôt really care about their feelings, and how upset this site makes them, or how much they cry at night knowing that there are people out in the world making fun of CrowdStrike for causing the worst IT outage in the world (so far!).
Stranding millions of airlines passengers, and causing <em>billions</em> of dollars worth of damage‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Of course, I did not want to piss off CloudFlare either, and I‚Äôm most definitely not trying to put CloudFlare in the middle on this‚Ä¶ so I told CloudFlare that I will take the site off of CloudFlare; however, it is staying on the internet‚Ä¶</p>
<p><img src="https://clownstrike.lol/crowdmad/abuse-resp1.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>It is unfortunately <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/what-really-does-and-doesnt-work-fair-use-dmca">well known</a> that the DMCA is used by corporate cyberbullies to take down content that they disagree with; but, is otherwise legal. The Counternotice system is also hillariously ineffective. The <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/512/">DMCA</a> requires service providers to ‚Äúact expeditiously to remove or disable access to the infringing material;‚Äù yet, it gives those same ‚Äúservice providers‚Äù <em>14 days</em> to restore access in the event of a counternotice! The DMCA, like much American legislation, is heavily biased towards corporations, instead of the actual, living, breathing, citizens of the country.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs absolutely asinine and I would love absolutely nothing more than to have a lawsuit ‚Äúwin‚Äù against CrowdStrike. That would be absolutely <em>amazing</em> for marketing! Especially given the timing of such events‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Additionally, using the Digital Millenium <em>Copyright</em> Act to attempt to takedown a parody site for <em>Trademark Infringement</em> is absolutely hillarious.</p>
<p>There are several ways that <em>anyone</em> is allowed to use a trademark belonging to ‚Äúothers.‚Äù This is considered ‚ÄúFair Use.‚Äù Fair Use is an important aspect of trademark and copyright law. It is a right to use trademarks and copyrighted works for parody, criticism, transformative works, news reporting / journalism, education, etc. Corporate cyberbullies don‚Äôt like that anyone else has rights. Again, I don‚Äôt care, because the only thing that matters is the law, and what a court thinks about it.</p>
<p><strong>Luckily‚Ä¶</strong> Parody is a well recognized ‚Äúright‚Äù for ‚Äúfair use‚Äù</p>

<p><strong>Additionally</strong>, there is a statutory exclusion for ‚ÄúAny noncommercial use of a mark‚Äù in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1125">15 U.S. Code ¬ß 1125 (c)(3)(c)</a>.</p>
<p>Seeing as how this site is an <em>obvious</em> parody, that any ‚Äúreasonable person‚Äù would be able to cleary identify <strong>AND</strong> there is no commercial use, no product being sold, no money being made in any way, shape, or form‚Ä¶</p>
<p>You can go straight to hell CrowdStrike. This is fair use. Fuck your feelings. Now‚Ä¶ <a href="https://clownstrike.lol/">Return to Clownin‚Äô</a></p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong> Don‚Äôt your lawyers have more important shit to be doing right now anyway?</p>
