    <h1>Blockbuster Video VHS insert template</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eviau.net/rfinnie/blockbuster/blob/main/blockbuster-vhs.png"><img src="https://www.eviau.net/rfinnie/blockbuster/raw/main/blockbuster-vhs.png" alt="Blockbuster Video VHS insert template" title="Blockbuster Video VHS insert template"/></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is an editable Inkscape template for a Blockbuster Video VHS clamshell case insert.  Please note that this doesn&#39;t strive to be 100% accurate to any specific Blockbuster design, as they made incremental design changes to their clamshells over the years.  Instead, it&#39;s meant to be a good enough period piece of late 80s through 90s.</p>

<p dir="auto">The fields you&#39;d want to change are all in Liberation Sans and Liberation Sans Narrow fonts, but if you don&#39;t have them, similar sans-serif fonts should work fine.</p>
<p dir="auto">The back blurb area is Nimbus Mono PS font, but again, any typewriter-like monospace font should be fine. I&#39;ve also seen &#34;The BLOCKBUSTER difference&#34; blurb in a sans-serif font.  Later on in the 90s, this space tended to be used for actual movie information, in a sans-serif font.</p>
<p dir="auto">The &#34;BLOCKBUSTER VIDEO&#34; logo font is ITC Machine Std and the barcode is Libre Barcode 128. I&#39;ve broken these out to separate layers which have alternate layers which are &#34;pre-rendered&#34;, so you do not need the fonts.</p>
<p dir="auto">An additional set of layers are available for the simpler &#34;BLOCKBUSTER&#34; logo used later.</p>
<p dir="auto">The barcode format changed several times over the years, but the format depicted here is:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>33: Rental. There were likely other codes for things like services, goods, etc.</li>
<li>55740: The 5-digit store number.</li>
<li>809656: A title-specific internal Blockbuster ID.</li>
<li>003: The per-title sequence for the store. For example, if the store had 10 copies of a title, they would be 001 through 010.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">I don&#39;t know what &#34;Rent Code&#34; is, but I&#39;ve seen &#34;B&#34;, &#34;N&#34; and &#34;T&#34;.</p>
<p dir="auto">&#34;FOX 2000306&#34; is the studio-specific catalog number for a title (in this case, for Fight Club).</p>
<p dir="auto">The title area may just have the title, but it could also have extra information listed. A common alternative format would be &#34;FIGHT CLUB-1999-BRAD PITT&#34;.  Sometimes it would also show &#34;NEW RELEASE-FIGHT CLUB&#34;.</p>
<p dir="auto">The most minor variation, but I&#39;ve seen the rating (&#34;R&#34; in this example) sometimes be bolded, sometimes not.</p>
<p dir="auto">For a list of addresses and store numbers as of Blockbuster&#39;s bankruptcy, see <a href="https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/BlockbusterCh11.pdf" rel="nofollow">this bankruptcy filing from 2010</a>. Finding the phone number from the store will take some additional searching.</p>
<p dir="auto">A hidden layer outlines where the spine is in relation to the elements, for alignment purposes. Notice that the spine&#39;s barcode actually wraps around to the back a little, by design.</p>
<p dir="auto">For an authentic Blockbuster case experience, take the &#34;Barcodes&#34; and &#34;Fillable text&#34; layers, group them all together, and shift them by a random amount relative to the base design, before printing.</p>
<p dir="auto">Blockbuster also used VHS clamshells for SNES and Genesis cartridge distribution.  In these cases, the category is &#34;GAMES SNES&#34; or &#34;GAMES GENESIS&#34;, rating &#34;N/A&#34;. The title will likely have &#34;SNES-&#34; or &#34;GENESIS-&#34; prefixing the actual game title.</p>

<p dir="auto">Reproduction created by <a href="https://www.finnie.org/" rel="nofollow">Ryan Finnie</a>. I&#39;m not sure about the legal standing of a design semi-reproduction of a defunct company, but this template is licensed CC-BY-SA 4.0 International, to the extent it can be licensed.</p>
<p dir="auto">By the way, the location depicted on the template in Green Bay is a location I have pleasant memories of, having competed in the Blockbuster World Video Game Championships II competition in 1995, playing on the <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Donkey_Kong_Country_Competition_Cartridge" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Country Competition Cartridge</a>. I finished second place in the Nintendo division for that store.</p>
