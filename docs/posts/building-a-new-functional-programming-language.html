Why am I building a new functional programming language?
</a>
</h3>
<div><p>
I once asked Guido van Rossum (the creator of Python, and my former teammate working on Google App Engine) what he thought of functional programming languages. I had told him about my recent frustration in trying to learn Haskell, and my skepticism from using Lisp. His reply was eye-opening: He spoke of the potential for functional languages to provide a significant, intrinsic advantage when it comes to parallel computing. I had never observed this myself, so I found the concept intriguing and it stuck with me.
