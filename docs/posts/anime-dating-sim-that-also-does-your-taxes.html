          Most wealthy countries make tax filing free, if the burden of
          preparation is even passed along to individuals at all. TurboTax
          actively seeks to backdoor the regulatory structure that could
          otherwise seek to rein it in. And it works! The villainous
          corporation that controls the government from the shadows is a sadly
          mundane reality. It’s the most boring industry imaginable.
        </p> <p data-v-df642fc4="">
          TurboTax, per its own internal documents, is built on the “Fear,
          Uncertainty, and Doubt” that ordinary people have about their taxes.
          Against this, we pit free software instead built on parasocial
          desire for intimacy and benign horniness! If TurboTax is Dark UI,
          TH3K is Pink UI, the nightcore of tax software.
