    <h1>Anime dating sim that also does your taxes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="manifesto" data-v-df642fc4="" data-v-4762ba8b=""> <div data-v-df642fc4=""><div data-v-df642fc4=""> <div data-v-df642fc4=""><p data-v-df642fc4="">Hi there! Iris here~</p> <p data-v-df642fc4="">
          It’s always been a dream of mine to meet that special someone…and
          file their tax return. Join me and we’ll search for deductions while
          searching for love!
        </p> <p data-v-df642fc4="">
          But be careful! We’re not alone. Corporate tax filing services like
          TurboTax are (by dint of extensive lobbying) predatory, parasitic
          bottlenecks that deliberately complicate the tax filing process in
          order to make it unnavigable by ordinary people. They feed us their
          poison so that we buy their medicine!
        </p></div></div> <div data-v-df642fc4=""> <div data-v-df642fc4=""><p data-v-df642fc4="">
          Most wealthy countries make tax filing free, if the burden of
          preparation is even passed along to individuals at all. TurboTax
          actively seeks to backdoor the regulatory structure that could
          otherwise seek to rein it in. And it works! The villainous
          corporation that controls the government from the shadows is a sadly
          mundane reality. It’s the most boring industry imaginable.
        </p> <p data-v-df642fc4="">
          TurboTax, per its own internal documents, is built on the “Fear,
          Uncertainty, and Doubt” that ordinary people have about their taxes.
          Against this, we pit free software instead built on parasocial
          desire for intimacy and benign horniness! If TurboTax is Dark UI,
          TH3K is Pink UI, the nightcore of tax software.
        </p></div></div> <div data-v-df642fc4=""> <div data-v-df642fc4=""><p data-v-df642fc4="">
          Videogames are, at the end of the day, pieces of
          software–ontologically akin to Microsoft Word. All of TurboTax’s
          cutesy loading animations are fake graphics; TH3K simply makes the
          fiction the point. For some reason the game-to-real-life interface
          has tended to remain in the purview of corporate metaverse fictions.
          TH3K is a dongle that adapts from a visual novel to the IRS.
        </p> <p data-v-df642fc4="">
          Come on, let’s get started! I can already tell I’m going to like you
          ♥ And remember,
          <span data-v-df642fc4="">if you die in the game you die in real life</span>
          if you file your taxes in the game, you file your taxes in real
          life.
