    <h1>Ask HN: Alternatives to Scratch for a blind child?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey HN,</p><p>My friend’s children are starting their adventure with programming at school with Scratch. Unfortunately, the eldest one is blind, and as Scratch is visual, he won’t be able to use it. A pity: the kid has probably the most vivid imagination of all people I know.</p><p>Can you recommend an alternative? Something tactile or audial, perhaps? A quick googling yielded <a href="https://codejumper.com/" rel="nofollow">https://codejumper.com/</a> – is it worth the $1K it costs?</p><p>Personal experience reports are most welcome. Thanks!</p></div></div></div>
