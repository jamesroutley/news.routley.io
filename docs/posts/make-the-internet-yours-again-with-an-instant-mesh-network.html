    <h1>Make the internet yours again with an instant mesh network</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>I’m going to lead with the technical punch line, and then explain it:</p>
<p><a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/">Yggdrasil Network</a> is an opportunistic mesh that can be deployed privately or as part of a global-scale network.  Each node gets a stable IPv6 address (or even an entire /64) that is derived from its public key and is bound to that node as long as the node wants it (of course, it can generate a new keypair anytime) and is valid wherever the node joins the mesh.  All traffic is end-to-end encrypted.</p>
<p>Yggdrasil will automatically discover peers on a LAN via broadcast beacons, and requires zero configuration to peer in such a way.  It can also run as an overlay network atop the public Internet.  Public peers serve as places to join the global network, and since it’s a mesh, if one device on your LAN joins the global network, the others will automatically have visibility on it also, thanks to the mesh routing.</p>
<p>It neatly solves a lot of problems of portability (my ssh sessions stay live as I move networks, for instance), VPN (incoming ports aren’t required since local nodes can connect to a public peer via an outbound connection), security, and so forth.</p>
<p>Now on to the explanation:</p>
<p><b>The Tyranny of IP rigidity</b></p>
<p>Every device on the Internet, at one time, had its own globally-unique IP address.  This  number was its identifier to the world; with an IP address, you can connect to any machine anywhere.  Even now, when you connect to a computer to download a webpage or send a message, under the hood, your computer is talking to the other one by IP address.</p>
<p>Only, now it’s hard to get one.  The Internet protocol we all grew up with, version 4 (IPv4), didn’t have enough addresses for the explosive growth we’ve seen.  Internet providers and IT departments had to use a trick called NAT (Network Address Translation) to give you a sort of fake IP address, so they could put hundreds or thousands of devices behind a single public one.  That, plus the mobility of devices — changing IPs whenever they change locations — has meant that a fundamental rule of the old Internet is now broken:</p>
<p>Every participant is an equal peer.  (Well, not any more.)</p>
<p>Nowadays, you can’t you host your own website from your phone.  Or share files from your house.  (Without, that is, the use of some third-party service that locks you down and acts as an intermediary.)</p>
<p>Back in the 90s, I worked at a university, and I, like every other employee, had a PC on my desk with an unfirewalled public IP.  I installed a webserver, and poof – instant website.  Nowadays, running a website from home is just about impossible.  You may not have a public IP, and if you do, it likely changes from time to time.  And even then, your ISP probably blocks you from running servers on it.</p>
<p>In short, you have to buy your way into the resources to participate on the Internet.</p>
<p>I wrote about these problems in more detail in my article <a href="https://changelog.complete.org/archives/10231-recovering-our-lost-free-will-online-tools-and-techniques-that-are-available-now">Recovering Our Lost Free Will Online</a>.</p>
<p><b>Enter Yggdrasil</b></p>
<p>I already gave away the punch line at the top.  But what does all that mean?</p>

<li>Every device that participates gets an IP address that is fully live on the Yggdrasil network.</li>
<li>You can host a website, or a mail server, or whatever you like with your Yggdrasil IP.</li>
<li>Encryption and authentication are smaller (though not nonexistent) worries thanks to the built-in end-to-end encryption.</li>
<li>You can travel the globe, and your IP will follow you: onto a plane, from continent to continent, wherever.  Yggdrasil will find you.</li>


<p>I’ve set up /etc/hosts on my laptop to use the Yggdrasil IPs for other machines on my LAN.  Now I can just “ssh foo” and it will work — from home, from a coffee shop, from a 4G tether, wherever.  Now, other tools like tinc can do this, obviously.  And I could stop there; I could have a completely closed, private Yggdrasil network.</p>
<p>Or, I can join the global Yggdrasil network.  Each device, in addition to accepting peers it finds on the LAN, can also be configured to establish outbound peering connections or accept inbound ones over the Internet.  Put a public peer or two in your configuration and you’ve joined the global network.  Most people will probably want to do that on every device (because why not?), but you could also do that from just one device on your LAN.  Again, there’s no need to explicitly build routes via it; your other machines on the LAN will discover the route’s existence and use it.</p>
<p>This is one of many projects that are working to democratize and decentralize the Internet.  So far, it has been quite successful, growing to over 2000 nodes.  It is the direct <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/2019/01/09/history.html">successor</a> to the earlier cjdns/Hyperboria and BATMAN networks, and aims to be a proof of concept and a viable tool for global expansion.</p>
<p>Finally, think about how much easier development is when you don’t have to necessarily worry about TLS complexity in every single application.  When you don’t have to worry about port forwarding and firewall penetration.  It’s what the Internet should be.</p>
