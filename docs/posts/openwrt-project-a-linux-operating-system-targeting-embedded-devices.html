<p>
The OpenWrt Project is a Linux operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management. This frees you from the application selection and configuration provided by the vendor and allows you to customize the device through the use of packages to suit any application. For developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned.

OpenWrt — building on their sixteen years of success as the most popular Free and Open Source (<abbr title="Free &amp; Open-Source Software">FOSS</abbr>) wireless router project — today joins <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/" title="https://sfconservancy.org/" rel="ugc nofollow">Conservancy</a> as a member project. <abbr title="Free &amp; Open-Source Software">FOSS</abbr> wireless routers assure software freedom for all Internet users. Conservancy will help OpenWrt continue to thrive and grow as its new fiscal sponsor.

OpenWrt occupies a special place in the history of software freedom. OpenWrt&#39;s creation and launch shows that <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/" title="https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/" rel="ugc nofollow">GPL enforcement</a> works and advances software freedom. In 2004, when Linksys released the firmware code for the WRT54G router series, coders and tinkerers regained control over their own routers, and <a href="https://openwrt.org/about/history" title="about:history" data-wiki-id="about:history">launched OpenWrt based on the sources liberated from GPL enforcement</a>. Today, OpenWrt leverages software freedom protected by the <abbr title="GNU General Public License">GPL</abbr> to share that freedom and control with everyone who uses wireless routers to connect to the Internet.</em>
