    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Tread worn out? Tires are flat again and again and now buy a tire with puncture protection? Or put on a wider tire? Find the right tire now!</p><div><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):</h2><p>My tube often has a hole on the outside of the wheel, i.e. towards the casing, but I don&#39;t see any spiky object stuck in the casing/tire. Where does the hole in the tube come from?</p><p>Often a sharp object, such as a piece of glass or a piece of wire, has pierced the casing and caused the hole in the <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/tube.html">tube</a>. The sharp object usually falls off again and can no longer be seen later. For me, putting on puncture protection tires, which are tires with an extra protective layer underneath the tread, worked wonders and permanently solved the problem.</p><p>What is the difference between a tire and a casing?</p><p>Occasionally, tires are understood to be the combination of a casing and an inner tube. On this page, however, I make no distinction and use both terms synonymously.</p><p>Which tire is the best for my road bike, city bike, trekking bike, mountain bike, Dutch bike, folding bike, e-bike, pedelec, kids bike, youth bike, wheelchair, unicycle, or bicycle trailer?</p><p>The best way to replace the tire with a new one of the same size is to type in the label on the tire above and pay attention to the dimensions shown, then you&#39;ll be on the safe side. However, depending on your riding speed and trail conditions, different tire widths and air pressure may be more comfortable. Here you can vary if you are dissatisfied with the driving behavior of your bike.</p></div><p>* The links marked with an asterisk (*) are so-called affiliate links (advertising).

Values less than 4 I have deliberately omitted, because these have too little protective effect in my opinion.</p></div>
