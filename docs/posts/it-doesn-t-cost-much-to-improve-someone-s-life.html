I can’t think of anything I’d rather contribute to.</span></p><p><span>One reason small amounts of funding can </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/cost-effectiveness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>have a big impact</span></a><span> is that a dollar goes much further in the poorest countries than in the richest. Treatments that many of us might take for granted — like the polio vaccine — often cost </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/costs-of-polio-vaccines-in-low-income-countries"><span>as little as a few dollars</span></a><span>. For the cost of a takeaway coffee, we could vaccinate several children from potentially fatal diseases.</span></p><p><span>How can the world achieve more of this?</span></p><p><span>I feel like I’m in a good position — arguably one of the best positions in history — to help with this in some way. The </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-inequality-of-opportunity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>biggest factor</span></a><span> in someone’s opportunities and outcomes is where and when they were born. That is a random lottery. And I happened to get a lucky draw for two reasons.</span></p><p><span>First, I was born in a rich country, the United Kingdom. Second, I was born at a time and in circumstances that have given me some disposable income and the freedom to choose how to spend it.</span></p><p><span>That gives me two ways to contribute. First, I can advocate for and put pressure on my government to increase its spending on foreign aid. Second, I can make a personal contribution to some of the most cost-effective charities in lower-income countries.</span></p><p><span>If you’re in a similar position to me — or have at least </span><em><span>one</span></em><span> of those options — then there’s something we can do to have a positive impact.</span></p><p><span>One question you might have is whether most of the world’s aid comes from governments or private donors, which are dominated by billionaire-funded philanthropies. If it’s the former, citizens can have </span><em><span>some</span></em><span> influence on the global aid budget. If it’s the latter, it’s completely out of our hands.</span></p><p><span>As the chart below shows, more than 95% of foreign aid came from national governments in 2023. Just under $11 billion — or 4.5% of the total — came from private grants.</span><a href="#note-5"><sup><span>5</span></sup></a></p><p><span>Note that private donors, here, only include contributions submitted to the OECD that meet its criteria for development grants. This is mostly from large philanthropic foundations. It’s not to be confused with total </span><a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/data/indicators/private-flows.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>private flows for development</span></a><span>, which can include foreign investment, money sent home by migrants, and other forms of private money transfer.</span></p><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/3918cfd6-9297-4d0d-214c-ed96d210aa00/w=48 48w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/3918cfd6-9297-4d0d-214c-ed96d210aa00/w=100 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/3918cfd6-9297-4d0d-214c-ed96d210aa00/w=350 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/3918cfd6-9297-4d0d-214c-ed96d210aa00/w=850 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/3918cfd6-9297-4d0d-214c-ed96d210aa00/w=1350 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/3918cfd6-9297-4d0d-214c-ed96d210aa00/w=1620 1620w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"/><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/3918cfd6-9297-4d0d-214c-ed96d210aa00/w=1620" alt="A bar graph titled &#34;More than 95% of foreign aid comes from governments, rather than private donors&#34; illustrates the distribution of foreign aid in 2023.

Let me illustrate this point with some back-of-the-envelope calculations.</span></p><p><span>The United States </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/foreign-aid-given-net?time=latest"><span>gave $62 billion</span></a><span> in aid in 2023. If it had cut its aid budget by just 20%, its contributions would have been around $13 billion lower. That would be the same as eliminating </span><em><span>all</span></em><span> private philanthropic donations worldwide.</span><a href="#note-6"><sup><span>6</span></sup></a></p><p><span>Even reductions in funding from much smaller nations — like my home country, the UK — could have a large impact. “Reform UK”, one of the UK’s right-wing parties, </span><a href="https://www.reformparty.uk/slash-government-waste" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>pledged to halve</span></a><span> foreign aid in its last manifesto. A halving of foreign aid would have reduced the UK’s contributions by $8.7 billion.</span><a href="#note-7"><sup><span>7</span></sup></a><span> Again, that’s not far — in relative terms — from the $10.8 billion given by all private donors combined.</span></p><p><span>Even more recently, the UK prime minister </span><em><span>did</span></em><span> announce </span><a href="https://www.cgdev.org/blog/breaking-down-prime-minister-starmers-aid-cut" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>a $6 billion cut</span></a><span> to foreign aid by 2027. That’s equal to more than half of all private philanthropic grants.</span></p><p><span>The second implication is that if we want to see an increase in global foreign aid, building </span><em><span>public</span></em><span> support for more generous aid budgets from our governments matters a lot. In the next section, I’ll run some numbers to prove this.</span></p><p><span>We can illustrate this point by focusing on the UN’s target for developed countries to give 0.7% of their GNI to foreign aid.</span><a href="#note-8"><sup><span>8</span></sup></a><span> Only five countries — Norway, Luxembourg, Sweden, Germany, and Denmark — </span><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/five-developed-countries-met-the-uns-target-for-foreign-aid-in2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>met this target</span></a><span> in 2023.</span></p><p><span>Let’s imagine that the public in developed countries pressured their governments to step up and meet this target. If </span><em><span>all </span></em><span>developed countries achieved this, we’d add an extra $216 billion to the pot, meaning the global official development assistance budget would almost double.</span><a href="#note-9"><sup><span>9</span></sup></a><span> This is illustrated in the chart below. Remember: private donors collectively gave $11 billion in 2023, so this increase would equate to around 20 times as much.</span></p><figure><div><picture><source srcset="https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/1284b0d6-5441-44af-b98d-d65ea7e6bd00/w=48 48w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/1284b0d6-5441-44af-b98d-d65ea7e6bd00/w=100 100w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/1284b0d6-5441-44af-b98d-d65ea7e6bd00/w=350 350w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/1284b0d6-5441-44af-b98d-d65ea7e6bd00/w=850 850w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/1284b0d6-5441-44af-b98d-d65ea7e6bd00/w=1350 1350w, https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/1284b0d6-5441-44af-b98d-d65ea7e6bd00/w=1620 1620w" type="image/png" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 95vw, (min-width: 960px) 853px"/><img src="https://ourworldindata.org/cdn-cgi/imagedelivery/qLq-8BTgXU8yG0N6HnOy8g/1284b0d6-5441-44af-b98d-d65ea7e6bd00/w=1620" alt="A vertical bar chart illustrates the amount of foreign aid given and the potential increase if governments met the United Nations target of donating 0.7% of their Gross National Income (GNI).

An </span><a href="https://worldpublicopinion.net/american-public-vastly-overestimates-amount-of-u-s-foreign-aid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>earlier survey</span></a><span> found similar results, with the average guess being 25%.</span></p><figure><figcaption><span>These questions are about federal spending, which differs from GNI.

That’s ten times more than what is currently spent.</span></p><p><span>Not all surveys find such a large discrepancy between public perception and reality, but the gaps are still big. In </span><a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/352423-ontwikkelingshulp-overschat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>a 2012 survey</span></a><span> in the Netherlands, the average guess was that 5.6% of GDP was spent on foreign aid. The correct answer was 0.7%.</span></p><p><span>So, while “foreign aid” is often the </span><a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/trackers/what-sector-is-the-uk-government-spending-too-much-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>most common answer</span></a><span> to questions like, “What sector is the government spending too much on?” some of this might be explained by the fact that most people think we spend far more on foreign aid than we actually do.</span></p><p><span>As I said earlier, pressuring governments in rich countries to increase foreign aid — or voting for political parties that would — is just one way that I can help move money from the top to the bottom of the global income distribution.</span></p><p><span>I also donate some of my money directly to the most effective causes. Several years ago, I took the </span><a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Giving What We Can</span></a><span> pledge, committing to give at least 10% of my income to charity. I specifically focus on programs working in some of the lowest-income countries and on causes where small amounts of money can do a lot. The charity evaluator </span><a href="https://www.givewell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>GiveWell</span></a><span> is a good resource to find some of the most cost-effective causes to support.</span></p><p><span>This point on cost-effectiveness is particularly important to me in terms of personal donations, but it also matters when it comes to foreign aid. At the beginning of this article, I highlighted a number of successful aid programs: efforts to eradicate polio, reduce deaths from HIV and malaria, and provide food supplies during famine. It would be great if all aid money were as well-spent as this, but that’s not the reality. Some foreign aid </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> spent on programs and activities that make little difference. More than half of Brits </span><a href="https://www.bond.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/bond-aid-tracker-online.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>think that</span></a><span> aid is a complete waste due to corruption, and it’s these examples that can often make people sceptical that their dollars are being put to good use.</span></p><p><span>While I advocate for an increase in the foreign aid budget (and personal donations) overall, I’d also like to see a renewed focus on making sure that we’re spending this money in the best possible way.
