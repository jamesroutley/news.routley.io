<p>Today, the web developer version would be &#34;my site&#39;s building&#34; and they would be
playing swords in VR.</p>
<p>Sites take time to build these days. A large Next.js 11 site will take several
minutes to build. This is wasted time in the development cycle. Build tools like
<a href="https://vitejs.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vite</a> or <a href="https://turbo.build/pack" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbopack</a> highlight
their ability to get this number down.</p>
<p>But the deeper question hasn&#39;t been considered:</p>
<p><em>Why do we even need a build step?</em></p>

tags in your <code>index.html</code> and all was golden.</p>
<p>Then Node was created, allowing developers to write servers and backends in
JavaScript. Soon, developers no longer needed to know multiple languages to
build scalable, production-ready apps. They only needed to know JavaScript.</p>
