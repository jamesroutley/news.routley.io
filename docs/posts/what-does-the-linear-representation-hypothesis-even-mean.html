    <h1>What Does the Linear Representation Hypothesis Even Mean?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>The linear representation hypothesis is one of those pieces of widely believed folk wisdom in AI interpretability: high-level concepts that are semantically meaningful to humans are somehow linearly represented in the internal spaces of language models.</p>

<p>But what does “linear representation” actually mean? There are at least three distinct things people have looked at:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Word2Vec-style analogies</strong>: king - queen ≈ man - woman. A linear correspondence between concepts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Logistic regression probes</strong>: You can use a linear model to predict high-level semantic concepts (is this English or French?) from internal representations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Steering vectors</strong>: There exists some vector you can add to a representation that changes an attribute in isolation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The problem: these three things don’t obviously have anything to do with each other. It’s not clear which is the “right” notion or why they should be related.</p>

<p>To make progress, we need to say what a “concept” is. The key insight: use tools from causal inference and causal representation learning. A concept is any factor of variation that can be changed in isolation to affect the output. These don’t need to have an ontological status for the model—they’re defined by their causal role.</p>

<p>This lets us prove theorems and make sharp predictions rather than relying on intuition.</p>
