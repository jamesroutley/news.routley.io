    <h1>Hynix launches 321-layer NAND</h1>

<p>Following its launch of a  238-layer NAND in June last year, Hynix has become the world’s first supplier of tNAND with over 300 layers by finding a technological breakthrough for stacking.</p>
<p>The 321-layer device offers a 12% improvement write time and a  13% improvement in read time. Compared to the 238-layer device.</p><div id="elect-734343879">

</div>
<p>The company plans to provide the 321-layer products to customers from the first half of next year.</p><div id="elect-1364708447"></div><div id="elect-158804721"></div><div id="elect-1060596710">

<p>Stacking more than 300 layers came into reality as the company successfully adopted the “3 plugs” process technology.</p>
<p>The process  connects three plugs through an optimised follow-up process after three times of plug processes are finished. For the process, Hynix developed a low-stress  material, while introducing the technology that automatically corrects alignments among the plugs.</p>
<p>With the adoption of the same development platform from the 238-high NAND on the 321-high product, the company could also improve the productivity by 59%, compared with the previous generation, by minimizing any impacts from a process switch.</p>
