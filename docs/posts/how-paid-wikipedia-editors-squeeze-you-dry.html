    <h1>How paid Wikipedia editors squeeze you dry</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><i>The Signpost</i> has identified an extensive scam perpetrated by a company that calls itself &#34;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231219174548/https://elitewikiwriters.com/">Elite Wiki Writers</a>&#34; or &#34;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240114105508/https://wikimoderator.com/">Wiki Moderator</a>&#34;, among many other names. Some of the other names they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_paid_editing_companies" title="Wikipedia:List of paid editing companies">are suspected of using</a> include <code>wikicuratorz.com</code>, <code>wikiscribes.com</code>, <code>wikimastery.com</code>, and <code>wikimediafoundetion.com</code>.
</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Rauwerda" title="Annie Rauwerda">Annie Rauwerda</a> described the general situation in a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://nitter.net/depthsofwiki/status/1623052615020957696#m">series of tweets</a> a year ago.  Her recommendation:
</p>
<blockquote><p>You should know that 99% of all &#34;Wikipedia editing companies&#34; are scams that charge you $1000 for articles then never write them. Do not give them your money
</p></blockquote>
<p>That &#34;99%&#34; may be an unscientific estimate, but it&#39;s not far from our own estimate of over 95%. Wikipedia has made great strides in fighting this type of paid editor. But we&#39;ve barely made a start with another part of the problem.
</p><p>Shaun Spalding, legal counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) told <i>The Signpost</i>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The volunteer community is extremely diligent about finding and deleting any promotional material that marketing companies try to post on Wikipedia. Thanks to the community, paid editing firms rarely succeed in influencing the actual content on Wikipedia. There are paid editing firms that we are aware of with a 0% success rate. Unfortunately, victims of these scams don&#39;t know this, and many paid editing firms act in a predatory manner taking advantage of this. If anyone receives an email or social media message from someone offering to make a Wikipedia page for you, then it is almost certainly a scam.<br/>
</p><p>My advice is to be extremely skeptical of anyone claiming that they can guarantee to make a Wikipedia article for or about you, even if they claim to be an administrator. It is likely that they are not telling the truth. The portfolios that they might send you as &#34;proof&#34; of their experience are almost certainly fabricated. As are the physical addresses that they list on their websites; they don&#39;t list their real addresses because they don&#39;t want to get caught by the Foundation. There are no paid editing firms that have a relationship with the Wikimedia Foundation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To maintain the privacy of the victims of the scam, we have not linked to any website that might embarrass them, and have not revealed their names without their permission. 
</p><p>Both &#34;Elite Wiki Writers&#34; and &#34;Wiki Moderator&#34; list the same address, 99 Wall Street in New York City — which appears to be a maildrop rather than a real office — and a second address in Skokie, Illinois. The company appears to have preyed upon more than 100 customers in 2023, according to a customer list obtained by <i>The Signpost</i>.
</p><p>These customers include many small businesses (such as a single-store painting supply company), writers and artists, churches and religious publishers, a couple of lawyers, some little-known financial firms, nonprofits, a private detective agency, young entrepreneurs, former government officials and retired military officers — the whole range of people who would like some publicity and aspire to a Wikipedia article. 
</p><p>These people are certainly victims. Less than 5% of them succeed in getting an article on Wikipedia. Prices start at about $750, and quickly escalate to $1,500 or $10,000 — or more — as the &#34;Elite Wiki Writers&#34; claim that extra work is needed, or requirements have been raised by Wikipedia. We estimate that the proceeds of this scam in 2023 were at least $500,000, and perhaps well over $1,000,000. 
</p><p>The low number of them posted as actual articles (as opposed to drafts or user pages) could be from a lack of trying. There&#39;s little evidence that many of their proposed articles are written up as drafts at all, and if they are, they&#39;re commonly left without improvement until they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:G13" title="Wikipedia:G13">deleted automatically</a>.
</p><p>In 2021, three editors who claimed to work for Elite Wiki Writers (or related firms) did post a total of 71 articles as drafts or articles, in a clumsy attempt to become rule-abiding &#34;declared&#34; paid editors. They were globally locked by stewards following a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/CharmenderDeol" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/CharmenderDeol">sockpuppet investigation</a>, where 41 editors were blocked and confirmed as sockpuppets of <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:CharmenderDeol">CharmenderDeol</a></span>. The reason the three declared paid editors were globally locked is likely that they were sockpuppets secretly controlled by undeclared paid editors.

<p>How is somebody who wants to pay for an article on Wikipedia to know which websites are legitimate and which are scammers? As a rule, potential customers of these firms should be very skeptical of &#34;Wikipedia editing firms&#34; who advertise on the web. They nearly all show some signs of a scam.
</p><p>For example, in this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231219174548/https://elitewikiwriters.com/">archived homepage of Elite Wiki Writers</a>, you&#39;ll see several drawings and illustrations taken from Wikipedia, including the Wikipedia trademark known as the &#34;puzzle globe&#34; — albeit one much the worse for wear.
</p>
<div><figure typeof="mw:File"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg"><img alt="Placeholder alt text" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg/300px-Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg.png" decoding="async" width="300" height="274" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg/450px-Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg/600px-Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg.png 2x" data-file-width="103" data-file-height="94"/></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Wikipedia&#39;s puzzle globe symbol is a trademark. Permission to use is governed by <a href="https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Trademark_policy" title="foundation:Policy:Trademark policy">WMF trademark policy</a>.</p>
<p>A good first question for a potential customer to ask Elite Wiki Writers might be: &#34;have you complied with the license on those illustrations and do you have permission to use the trademarked puzzle globe?&#34; If they answer &#34;yes&#34; on the trademark, you can contact the Wikimedia Foundation&#39;s legal department at one of the email addresses listed <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Legal_department#Wikimedia_Foundation_Email_Contacts" title="meta:Wikimedia Foundation Legal department">here</a>. If they answer &#34;no&#34;, you&#39;ll know that they don&#39;t follow the rules.
</p><p>Spalding says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>You do not need to pay someone to get a Wikipedia page; the majority of firms that want you to pay them to get one are scams. They will not succeed in delivering a live Wikipedia page. The very small handful of legitimate marketing companies and reputation management firms engaged in this work are subject to the new &#34;Marketing Company Mediation&#34; provision added to the terms of use when it was updated in mid-2023. The updated terms of use have enabled the Foundation to increase our enforcement of the community&#39;s undisclosed paid editing rules in the last six months. We will continue to refine and resource this enforcement in 2024.<br/>
</p><p>These are some tips to help people identify paid editing scams:
</p>
<ul><li>If they reached out to you (via email or message) rather than you reaching out to them, it&#39;s likely a scam.</li>
<li>If the company doesn&#39;t have all of their user account names posted on their sales pages, then it&#39;s likely a scam since this is required by the terms of use. This goes for websites as well as things like freelancing profiles on Upwork.</li>
<li>Since these companies tend to lie and impersonate existing long-time editors, even if they mention their accounts, one should be additionally skeptical.<br/></li></ul>
<p>These are my most impactful suggestions for people who want to &#34;do something&#34; to help the problem:
</p>
<ul><li>If someone is scammed or has been scammed in the near past, they might be able to charge back the fraudulent transaction on their credit card</li>
<li>If someone receives a spam email from someone offering paid editing services, they should report the email to their email provider as spam to prevent it from going to others.</li>
<li>If someone receives a LinkedIn or social media message with an offer for paid editing, they should report the profile to the social media platform.</li></ul>

<p>Scams by &#34;paid editing companies&#34; have been happening on Wikipedia since at least the 2015 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Orangemoody" title="Operation Orangemoody">Operation Orangemoody</a> scandal, which was documented by the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/news/2015/08/31/wikipedia-accounts-blocked-paid-advocacy/" title="foundationsite:news/2015/08/31/wikipedia-accounts-blocked-paid-advocacy/">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, as well as by the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/02/wikipedia-blocks-editor-accounts-linked-to-extortion-scam"><i>Guardian</i></a>, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230327072220/http://www.independent.co.uk/tech/wikipedia-rocked-by-rogue-editors-blackmail-scam-targeting-small-businesses-and-celebrities-10481993.html"><i>Independent</i></a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2015-09-02/Special_report" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2015-09-02/Special report"><i>Signpost</i></a>.
</p><p>The Orangemoody scam worked like an extortion racket. Targeted articles would be nominated for deletion, or denied approval for publication. Then other editors, presumably working for the same firm, would offer their services to reinstate the article and &#34;protect&#34; it from deletion or unwanted changes — for a monthly charge. In reality, they couldn&#39;t protect anything, they didn&#39;t protect anything and their victims had no way to get the money back. See this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SCAM" title="Wikipedia:SCAM">warning</a> for further details.
</p><p>So another sign that a company might be scamming you is if they promise to &#34;protect&#34; the article. See Wikipedia&#39;s policy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN" title="Wikipedia:OWN">Ownership of content</a> for why this is not allowed. 
</p><p>The current scam is much simpler, and doesn&#39;t involve extortion.  The company advertises on their online sites, via email, or approaches people through social media sites such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn" title="LinkedIn">LinkedIn</a>. 
</p><p>They then quickly write a low-quality article, sending the customers a copy of the text. The scammer bills them, telling their victims that approval of the article by Wikipedia will take some time. Once they&#39;ve received payment, rather than going through the effort of trying to publish the article (and the risk of getting caught), the scammer may simply abandon the article, keeping the money. When the customers complain, the scammer blames the delay on Wikipedia, or tells the victim that other paid services are needed to ensure publication.

<p>While researching this article on <code>wikimoderator.com</code>, this reporter was asked to chat online by a purported &#34;Sr. Wikipedia administrator.&#34; The transcript of the discussion, generated by the website, follows. Only the names of this reporter (<span>Visitorxxx</span>) and the &#34;Sr. Wikipedia administrator&#34; (<span>GreySWA</span>) have been changed. A link to a real administrator&#39;s page has also been removed. The real administrator denies any association with the firm, and says they have never edited for pay.
</p>
<blockquote><p>Chat Transcript with Visitorxxx <br/>
</p><p>Chat started on 02 Nov 2023, 12:38 AM (GMT+0) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later, on the site <code>elitewikiwriters.com</code>, a different website apparently owned by the same company, I was invited to chat again by somebody giving the same name (shown as &#34;<span>GreySWA</span>&#34; above). That transcript shows much the same wording in places, possibly indicating that the same sales script was used.
</p><p>The transcript indicates that the company was breaking many of Wikipedia&#39;s rules. According to the policy for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Paid" title="Wikipedia:Paid">paid contribution disclosure</a>, every paid editor must declare when they are being paid and include the name of their employer, the client, and other affiliated parties. <b>There are no exceptions for the client or the employer.</b>  Administrators who edit for pay must also declare their paid status. 
</p><p>Some questions a potential client might wish to ask are:
</p>
<ul><li>Are you required to disclose my name on Wikipedia when I pay you to post an article?</li>
<li>Are administrators required to declare if they have been paid when they edit or accept a paid for article?</li>
<li>Can you direct me to one of your paid editors&#39; declaration of their paid status?</li></ul>
<p>If they answer any of these questions &#34;no&#34;, then they are likely trying to scam you.

<p>Many of the apparent scam victims on the Elite Wiki Writers customer list feared harassment, or were too embarrassed to be quoted by name in <i>The Signpost</i>. 
</p><p>One victim, who did not wish to use her real name because she feared harassment, we will call &#34;Melissa&#34;. When asked how she learned about Elite Wiki Writers, she told <i>The Signpost</i> that she was first approached on LinkedIn. &#34;It was a fake photo and profile,&#34; she said, which has since been removed. She was sold the basic + startup package last fall, which was to include a personal Wikipedia page and a page about her business, costing over $2,000.
</p><p>Another victim — let&#39;s call him &#34;Jared&#34; — asked not to be identified, but gave <i>The Signpost</i> an extensive interview. Jared is clearly a notable subject for a Wikipedia biography. He&#39;s had two successful careers: the first as a lawyer and judge, then as an author.
</p><p>He told <i>The Signpost</i> that he first ran into the article about him in Wikipedia several years ago, some time after it was first published. He didn&#39;t like the tag on the top about a possible conflict-of-interest by an editor. As time went by it started to look out-of-date, and he especially didn&#39;t like the photo. He would also have liked to see more about his career as a lawyer and a judge. But mostly he just wanted to see something that his grandchildren could read and be proud of.
</p><p>He was approached out of the blue on LinkedIn by a woman who offered to rewrite the article for a fee. He must have asked too many questions, and she eventually dropped the discussion. Then a new person appeared on LinkedIn to help rope him in. After some discussion about the article, the new guy said that he was moving to Australia, but gave Jared a contact at Elite Wiki Writers.
</p><p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJYbbaZOAmc#t=127s">Celeste Mergens</a> founded the nonprofit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_for_Girls" title="Days for Girls">Days for Girls</a> in 2008, and was its CEO until she retired in 2022. She&#39;s since written a book on the organization and its work, and is already promoting it with a book tour. Unfortunately, she&#39;s not familiar with Wikipedia&#39;s rules. She thought having a biography of her own on Wikipedia would help book sales, so she contacted Elite Wiki Writers, who promised that she would not have to reveal that she paid for the article because they &#34;use legitimate Wiki-moderators&#34;. She even got a $100 discount off the $750 fee for sending in a detailed draft.
</p><p>Yvonna Cazares is a community organizer who has previously held several community-oriented positions in California&#39;s state and local governments. Her first contact of any sort with Elite Wiki Writers was when she was approached on LinkedIn. She told <i>The Signpost</i> that her main interest in Elite Wiki Writers was having them provide editorial services for a book that was near completion. They offered her a Wikipedia article as part of a package deal.
The editorial services are a sideline that is not currently offered on the Elite Wiki Writers website. But following the online chats shown above with &#34;GreySWA&#34;, they offered this reporter the same type of services.
</p><p>Elite Wiki Writers offered Cazares several book editing packages, costing up to $8,500. Due to the low quality of the services and high cost, she soon believed that she was being scammed. 
She had difficulty getting a bank to accept a credit card payment, even though she had previously seen no problems with her credit card. 
Many credit card issuers have an effective system for avoiding liability for fraudulent credit card transactions.  Charges coming from merchants who have had too many recent customer complaints can trigger a refusal of the transaction during the time you&#39;re waiting on the phone. Apparently, this is what happened to one of Cazares&#39;s transactions. She later tried to cancel her previous transactions, and with determination and some luck she is now off the hook. Luckily, she had saved the documentation on all the credit card payments and refusals.
</p><p>Both Mergens and Jared had similar difficulties with credit card payments, even though neither had any previous problems with their credit cards.
</p><p>Mergens agreed to have the company write the article about her, but later was told that &#34;Wikipedia moderators&#34; now require eight citations, three more than the draft then had. And they would be willing to write the needed stories and quickly place them in top quality publications for only $5,000 apiece.  Mergens settled for three &#34;C-level&#34; articles for only $1,500 apiece.
</p><p>The surprises kept coming. She was dissatisfied with the quality of the new draft — and the inaccuracies in it — and she only saw one new source in the draft. After she was offered another discount, she attempted to pay with a credit card. But the payment wouldn&#39;t go through. So another credit card was used, but the invoice arrived with the name of another company. 
</p><p>Then Mergens discovered multiple complaints on an online customer review site against Elite Wiki Writers. Finally, she was able to totally cancel the order, and get most of the credit card charges reversed.
</p><p>Melissa also had troubles with her credit card. Elite Wiki Writers sold her additional services — for almost $4,000 — to ensure that the Wikipedia page could go live and &#34;be protected&#34;. The services supposedly included eight ghostwritten articles to serve as citations, a Google <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Knowledge_Graph" title="Google Knowledge Graph">Knowledge Graph</a>, wiki linking, and a semi-protection lock. After being charged for this, an additional $400 was charged to her credit card &#34;for taxes&#34; without notifying her or getting her permission.
</p><p>She was shown a mockup of a Wikipedia article on a non-Wikipedia page. She asked how she could edit it and was told that Wikipedia would charge her $5,000 to have external admin access to the page.
</p><p>After demanding the refund of all credit card charges, she has been harassed and needed to block Elite Wiki Writers employees on her telephone.
</p><p>Jared told <i>The Signpost</i> that Elite Wiki Writers did not tell him that he would have to be disclosed on Wikipedia as paying for the rewrite. They did tell him that Wikipedia required five citations and that they could provide these quickly from reputable news sources for an extra fee. He did his own research and provided Elite Wiki Writers with articles about him from local newspapers and major news sources from his state, but they did not use those sources.
</p><p>After he first suspected that he was being scammed, he learned that Wikipedia required that he be identified as paying for the article. He asked Elite Wiki Writers about it, but they wouldn&#39;t give him a straight answer. At that point he decided to cancel all payments.
</p><p>Cazares posted a complaint at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/elitewikiwriters.com?stars=1">Trustpilot.com</a>. Then she emailed Elite Wiki Writers: &#34;I feel completely taken advantage of, I spent so many hours and energy. Please stop doing this to people. I am not a wealthy person, but regardless, we are all people with dreams that we are trying to actualize. I&#39;m so disappointed in myself.&#34;
</p><p>They emailed her back, blaming her.
</p><p>She told <i>The Signpost</i>: &#34;This company needs to be exposed and people need to be aware. Most importantly, people who have been scammed should know they are not alone and it is not their fault that somebody misled them and took their money.&#34;

<p>Everybody associated with this scam, except for Elite Wiki Writers, comes out a loser. 
Wikipedians are victims because the encyclopedia&#39;s trademarks are used without permission. Volunteers&#39; time, Wikipedia&#39;s most valuable resource, is wasted sorting out hundreds of poorly researched articles, looking for one just one or two notable subjects. Much valuable time is taken from some of our most senior and energetic editors, working on sockpuppet investigation and deletion discussions. Administrators&#39; names and reputations are dragged through the mud. Nobody on Wikipedia benefits from having scammers operate here. 
</p><p>The main victims, of course, are the scammers&#39; customers. People with very little knowledge of Wikipedia and its rules are recruited via email, social media sites, and the company&#39;s own websites and then lied to. They are told that they can get a valuable article about themselves on Wikipedia. They pay their money and then they wait a few weeks, a few months, perhaps forever.
</p><p>Potential customers can protect themselves by asking normal questions about who they are dealing with. Get names of the people who contact you and of their bosses. Check if they are using the puzzle globe Wikipedia trademark. Also write down telephone numbers and addresses and save invoices and other documents. These are just the steps you should take for any large transaction.
</p><p>To screen people who contact you about a Wikipedia article or to help prevent them from scamming others, see <a href="#How_can_you_tell_who_is_honest?">this section above</a>.
</p><p>If you think you are being scammed ask these questions:
</p>
<ul><li>Are you required to disclose my name on Wikipedia when I pay you to post an article?</li>
<li>Are administrators required to declare if they have been paid when they edit or accept a paid for article?</li>
<li>Can you direct me to one of your paid editor&#39;s declaration of their paid status?</li>
<li>Can other people change my preferred version of my Wikipedia article?</li></ul>
<p>If they answer any of these questions &#34;no&#34; then don&#39;t believe another word they say. You are almost certainly being scammed.
