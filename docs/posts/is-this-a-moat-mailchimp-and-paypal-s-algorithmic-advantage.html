    <h1>Is This a Moat: Mailchimp and PayPalâ€™s Algorithmic Advantage</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2022/12/is_this_a_business_moat.jpg" alt="Is This a Moat: Mailchimp and PayPal&#x2019;s Algorithmic Advantage"><p>I&#x2019;m going to do something different with this piece. Most weeks, the Commoncog essay is something that I&#x2019;ve spent a great deal of time thinking through, often to the degree where I&#x2019;ve worked out most of the implications. This week, however, I&#x2019;m going to present two business cases, and then ask a series of questions for members to <a href="https://forum.commoncog.com/t/is-this-a-moat-mailchimp-and-paypal-s-algorithmic-advantage-commoncog/1294?u=cedric">answer in the forum</a>.</p><p>Note that I <em>don&#x2019;t</em> have a great answer for these questions right now. This is an ongoing business puzzle that I&#x2019;m trying to work out. After the discussion is done, I&#x2019;ll copy the best answers and append them to this essay.</p><p>I think this will make for an interesting experiment: would members enjoy this? Would you want me to do more of it? Let me know.</p><h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2><p>You&#x2019;re going to read two business cases. Here are my questions, so you know what to look out for:</p><ol><li>Long term Commoncog readers are going to be familiar with the idea of <em>sustainable</em> competitive advantage in business &#x2014; that is, that there are only <a>seven basic forms</a> (so-called the &#x2018;7 Powers&#x2019;), and they mostly work by protecting a business from margin compression over the long term. To unpack that a little: any sufficiently attractive business will attract competitors; competitors will slash prices to beat you; over a period of a few years you&#x2019;ll see your profit margins shrink. (You may read more about that <a>here</a>). In the two cases that you&#x2019;re about to read, is the competitive dynamic that is present a type of moat? Or is it a <strong>temporary</strong> competitive advantage, one that erodes over time?</li><li>If this is a moat, what is the nature of the Barrier? And what is its Benefit? Also: which one of the 7 Powers is it?</li><li>If it is <em>not</em> a moat, what lessons can you derive from the cases? How did this advantage ultimately affect the business? And what does it tell us about <em>non-moat</em> competitive advantages?</li></ol><p>You should be able to squint and see why I&#x2019;m asking these questions. One of the things we&#x2019;ve learnt in Commoncog is that <a href="https://commoncog.com/cognitive-flexibility-theory-the-rules/">case studies <em>really</em> matter</a> when we&#x2019;re learning business concepts. It&#x2019;s one thing to say &#x201C;oh, there are really only seven kinds of <em>sustainable</em> competitive advantage in business&#x201D;, and quite another to see a real world case where a company gains a powerful competitive advantage over its competitors that doesn&#x2019;t seem to fit neatly into the framework.</p><p>The better we get in reasoning and pattern matching against real world cases, the less likely we&#x2019;ll be taken by surprise when something similar occurs to us in our businesses.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s get started.</p><h2 id="mailchimp%E2%80%99s-early-edge">Mailchimp&#x2019;s Early Edge</h2><p>Mailchimp is an email marketing service provider, originally founded in 2001. Today, it is famous for being the incumbent, but it is also famous for being <em>completely bootstrapped</em> for the entirety of its 21 year history. Its history is even more remarkable when you consider that it did business in a crowded industry with many venture-funded competitors.</p>
