Today, we received confirmation from GoDaddy that multiple brands that resell GoDaddy Managed WordPress were impacted. The brands impacted include:</p>

</ul>
<p>According to Dan Rice, VP of Corporate Communications at GoDaddy,</p>
<p>“<em>The GoDaddy brands that resell GoDaddy Managed WordPress are 123Reg, Domain Factory, Heart Internet, Host Europe, Media Temple and tsoHost. A small number of active and inactive Managed WordPress users at those brands were impacted by the security incident. No other brands are impacted. Those brands have already contacted their respective customers with specific detail and recommended action.</em>”</p>
<p>tsoHost, 123Reg, Domain Factory, Heart Internet, and Host Europe were acquired by GoDaddy as part of Host Europe Group in 2017<sup>[1]</sup>, while Media Temple was bought by GoDaddy in 2013<sup>[2]</sup>.</p>
