    <h1>Who would buy a Raspberry Pi for $120?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>That is indeed a puzzling question, brought about by Raspberry Pi&#39;s introduction of the newest Raspberry Pi 5 model, with 16 GB of RAM.</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-16gb-ram.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 16GB RAM"/></p>

<p>I spent a couple weeks testing the new Pi model, and found it <em>does have its virtues</em>. But being only $20 away from a complete <a href="https://amzn.to/4jb4dO0">GMKTec N100 Mini PC with 8GB of RAM</a>, it&#39;s probably a step too far <em>for most people</em>.</p>

<p>For most, the 2 GB ($50) or 4 GB ($60) Pi 5 is a much better option. Or if you&#39;re <em>truly</em> budget conscious and want a well-supported SBC, the Pi 4 still exists, and starts at $35. Or a Pi Zero 2 W for $15.</p>

<p>And for stats nerds, the pricing model for Pi 5 follows this polynomial curve almost perfectly:</p>

<p><img width="700" height="auto" src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-model-b-pricing-curve.png" alt="Pi 5 model B pricing curve polynomial fit"/></p>

<p>...very much unlike Apple&#39;s memory and storage pricing for the M4 Mac mini, which follows an equation that ranges from &#34;excellent deal&#34; to &#34;exorbitant overcharge&#34;.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>

<p>Before I get to the reasons why some people might consider spending $120 on a Pi 5, I ran a bunch of benchmarks, and one of the more pertinent results is HPL:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/pi-5-8gb-vs-16gb-hpl-efficiency.png" width="700" height="394" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-6317a6d6-ac02-4322-9e45-30cd993b20c1" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;6317a6d6-ac02-4322-9e45-30cd993b20c1&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="High Performance Linpack - Pi 5 model B 8 GB vs 16 GB"/></p>

<p>This compares the performance of the 8 GB Pi 5 against the new 16 GB model. For many benchmarks, the biggest difference may be caused by the 16 GB model having the newer, trimmer <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/new-2gb-pi-5-has-33-smaller-die-30-idle-power-savings">D0 stepping of the BCM2712</a>. But for some, having more RAM helps, too.</p>

<p>Applications like ZFS can cache more files with more RAM, leading to lower latency and higher bandwidth file copies—in certain conditions.</p>

<p>For <em>all</em> my 16 GB Pi 5 benchmarks, see <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/sbc-reviews/issues/21#issuecomment-2579400396">this follow-up comment on my Pi 5 sbc-reviews thread</a>.</p>

<h2>5 Reasons a 16 GB Pi 5 should exist</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/raspberry-pi-5-forza-horizon-4-20fps.jpg" width="700" height="439" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-a1de2f26-e100-41e8-8555-1cb7b6df5bd2" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;a1de2f26-e100-41e8-8555-1cb7b6df5bd2&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="Raspberry Pi 5 eGPU setup playing Forza Horizon 4 Benchmark"/></p>

<p>But I distilled my thoughts into a list of 5 reasons the 16 GB Pi 5 ought to exist:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Keeping up with the Joneses</strong>: Everyone seems to be settling on 16 GB of RAM as the new laptop/desktop baseline—even <em>Apple</em>, a company notoriously stingy on RAM in its products! So having a high-end SBC with the same amount of RAM as a low-end desktop makes sense, if for no other reason than <em>just to have it available</em>.</li>
<li><strong>LLMs and &#39;AI&#39;</strong>: Love it or hate it, Large Language Models love RAM. The more, the merrier. The 8 GB Pi 5 can only handle up to an 8 billion parameter model, like <code>llama3.1:8b</code>. The 16 GB model can run much larger models, like <code>llama2:13b</code>. Whether getting 1-2 tokens/s on such a large model on a Pi 5 is <em>useful</em> is up to you to decide. I posted my Ollama benchmarks results <a href="https://github.com/geerlingguy/ollama-benchmark/issues/7">in this issue</a></li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: I already discussed this above, but along with the latest SDRAM tuning the Pi engineers worked on, this Pi is now the fastest <em>and</em> most efficient, especially owing to the newer D0 chip revision.</li>
<li><strong>Capacity and Consolidation</strong>: With more RAM, you can run more apps, or more threads. For example, a Pi 5 with 4 GB of RAM could run one Drupal or Wordpress website comfortably. With 16 GB, you could conceivably run <em>three or four</em> websites with decent traffic, assuming you&#39;re not CPU-bound. You could also run more instances on the same Pi of Docker containers or <a href="https://github.com/pimox/pimox7">pimox</a> VMs.</li>
<li><strong>AAA Gaming</strong>: This is, of course, a stretch... but there are some modern AAA games that I had trouble with on my <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/amd-radeon-pro-w7700-running-on-raspberry-pi">eGPU Pi 5 setup</a> which ran out of system memory on the 8 GB Pi 5, causing thrashing and lockups. For example: Forza Horizon 4, which seemed to enjoy using about 8 GB of system RAM total (alongside the 1 GB or so required by the OS and Steam).</li>
</ol>
