<h2>Summary of <small>GDB</small></h2>

<p>The purpose of a debugger such as <small>GDB</small> is to allow you to see what is
going on “inside” another program while it executes—or what another
program was doing at the moment it crashed.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

</li><li> Make your program stop on specified conditions.

</li><li> Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

</li><li> Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
</li></ul>

<p>You can use <small>GDB</small> to debug programs written in C and C<tt>++</tt>.
For more information, see <a href="#Supported-Languages">Supported Languages</a>.
For more information, see <a href="#C">C and C++</a>.
</p>
<p>Support for D is partial.  For information on D, see
<a href="#D">D</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-Modula_002d2"></a>
<p>Support for Modula-2 is partial.  For information on Modula-2, see
<a href="#Modula_002d2">Modula-2</a>.
</p>
<p>Support for OpenCL C is partial.  For information on OpenCL C, see
<a href="#OpenCL-C">OpenCL C</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-Pascal"></a>
<p>Debugging Pascal programs which use sets, subranges, file variables, or
nested functions does not currently work.  <small>GDB</small> does not support
entering expressions, printing values, or similar features using Pascal
syntax.
</p>
<a name="index-Fortran"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> can be used to debug programs written in Fortran, although
it may be necessary to refer to some variables with a trailing
underscore.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> can be used to debug programs written in Objective-C,
using either the Apple/NeXT or the GNU Objective-C runtime.

<h3>Free Software</h3>

<p><small>GDB</small> is <em>free software</em>, protected by the <small>GNU</small>
General Public License
(GPL).  The GPL gives you the freedom to copy or adapt a licensed
program—but every person getting a copy also gets with it the
freedom to modify that copy (which means that they must get access to
the source code), and the freedom to distribute further copies.
Typical software companies use copyrights to limit your freedoms; the
Free Software Foundation uses the GPL to preserve these freedoms.
</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the General Public License is a license which says that
you have these freedoms and that you cannot take these freedoms away
from anyone else.

<h3>Free Software Needs Free Documentation</h3>

<p>The biggest deficiency in the free software community today is not in
the software—it is the lack of good free documentation that we can
include with the free software.  Many of our most important
programs do not come with free reference manuals and free introductory
texts.  Documentation is an essential part of any software package;
when an important free software package does not come with a free
manual and a free tutorial, that is a major gap.  We have many such
gaps today.
</p>
<p>Consider Perl, for instance.  The tutorial manuals that people
normally use are non-free.  How did this come about?  Because the
authors of those manuals published them with restrictive terms—no
copying, no modification, source files not available—which exclude
them from the free software world.
</p>
<p>That wasn’t the first time this sort of thing happened, and it was far
from the last.  Many times we have heard a GNU user eagerly describe a
manual that he is writing, his intended contribution to the community,
only to learn that he had ruined everything by signing a publication
contract to make it non-free.
</p>
<p>Free documentation, like free software, is a matter of freedom, not
price.  The problem with the non-free manual is not that publishers
charge a price for printed copies—that in itself is fine.  (The Free
Software Foundation sells printed copies of manuals, too.)  The
problem is the restrictions on the use of the manual.  Free manuals
are available in source code form, and give you permission to copy and
modify.  Non-free manuals do not allow this.
</p>
<p>The criteria of freedom for a free manual are roughly the same as for
free software.  Redistribution (including the normal kinds of
commercial redistribution) must be permitted, so that the manual can
accompany every copy of the program, both on-line and on paper.
</p>
<p>Permission for modification of the technical content is crucial too.
When people modify the software, adding or changing features, if they
are conscientious they will change the manual too—so they can
provide accurate and clear documentation for the modified program.  A
manual that leaves you no choice but to write a new manual to document
a changed version of the program is not really available to our
community.
</p>
<p>Some kinds of limits on the way modification is handled are
acceptable.  For example, requirements to preserve the original
author’s copyright notice, the distribution terms, or the list of
authors, are ok.  It is also no problem to require modified versions
to include notice that they were modified.  Even entire sections that
may not be deleted or changed are acceptable, as long as they deal
with nontechnical topics (like this one).  These kinds of restrictions
are acceptable because they don’t obstruct the community’s normal use
of the manual.
</p>
<p>However, it must be possible to modify all the <em>technical</em>
content of the manual, and then distribute the result in all the usual
media, through all the usual channels.  Otherwise, the restrictions
obstruct the use of the manual, it is not free, and we need another
manual to replace it.
</p>
<p>Please spread the word about this issue.  Our community continues to
lose manuals to proprietary publishing.  If we spread the word that
free software needs free reference manuals and free tutorials, perhaps
the next person who wants to contribute by writing documentation will
realize, before it is too late, that only free manuals contribute to
the free software community.
</p>
<p>If you are writing documentation, please insist on publishing it under
the GNU Free Documentation License or another free documentation
license.  Remember that this decision requires your approval—you
don’t have to let the publisher decide.  Some commercial publishers
will use a free license if you insist, but they will not propose the
option; it is up to you to raise the issue and say firmly that this is
what you want.  If the publisher you are dealing with refuses, please
try other publishers.  If you’re not sure whether a proposed license
is free, write to <a href="mailto:licensing@gnu.org">licensing@gnu.org</a>.
</p>
<p>You can encourage commercial publishers to sell more free, copylefted
manuals and tutorials by buying them, and particularly by buying
copies from the publishers that paid for their writing or for major
improvements.  Meanwhile, try to avoid buying non-free documentation
at all.  Check the distribution terms of a manual before you buy it,
and insist that whoever seeks your business must respect your freedom.
Check the history of the book, and try to reward the publishers that
have paid or pay the authors to work on it.
</p>

published by other publishers, at

<h3>Contributors to <small>GDB</small></h3>

<p>Richard Stallman was the original author of <small>GDB</small>, and of many
other <small>GNU</small> programs.  Many others have contributed to its
development.  This section attempts to credit major contributors.  One
of the virtues of free software is that everyone is free to contribute
to it; with regret, we cannot actually acknowledge everyone here.  The
file <samp>ChangeLog</samp> in the <small>GDB</small> distribution approximates a
blow-by-blow account.
</p>
<p>Changes much prior to version 2.0 are lost in the mists of time.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Plea:</em> Additions to this section are particularly welcome.  If you
or your friends (or enemies, to be evenhanded) have been unfairly
omitted from this list, we would like to add your names!
</p></blockquote>

<h2>1 A Sample <small>GDB</small> Session</h2>

<p>You can use this manual at your leisure to read all about <small>GDB</small>.
However, a handful of commands are enough to get started using the
debugger.  This chapter illustrates those commands.
</p>


<p>One of the preliminary versions of <small>GNU</small> <code>m4</code> (a generic macro
processor) exhibits the following bug: sometimes, when we change its
quote strings from the default, the commands used to capture one macro
definition within another stop working.  In the following short <code>m4</code>
session, we define a macro <code>foo</code> which expands to <code>0000</code>; we
then use the <code>m4</code> built-in <code>defn</code> to define <code>bar</code> as the
same thing.  However, when we change the open quote string to
<code>&lt;QUOTE&gt;</code> and the close quote string to <code>&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;</code>, the same
procedure fails to define a new synonym <code>baz</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ <b>cd gnu/m4</b>
$ <b>./m4</b>
<b>define(foo,0000)</b>

<b>foo</b>
0000
<b>define(bar,defn(‘foo’))</b>

<b>bar</b>
0000
<b>changequote(&lt;QUOTE&gt;,&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;)</b>

<b>define(baz,defn(&lt;QUOTE&gt;foo&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;))</b>
<b>baz</b>
<b>Ctrl-d</b>
m4: End of input: 0: fatal error: EOF in string
</pre></div>

<p>Let us use <small>GDB</small> to try to see what is going on.
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ <b>gdb m4</b>
GDB is free software and you are welcome to distribute copies
 of it under certain conditions; type &#34;show copying&#34; to see
 the conditions.
There is absolutely no warranty for GDB; type &#34;show warranty&#34;
 for details.

GDB 13.0.50.20220321-git, Copyright 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc...
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p><small>GDB</small> reads only enough symbol data to know where to find the
rest when needed; as a result, the first prompt comes up very quickly.
We now tell <small>GDB</small> to use a narrower display width than usual, so
that examples fit in this manual.
</p>


<p>We need to see how the <code>m4</code> built-in <code>changequote</code> works.
Having looked at the source, we know the relevant subroutine is
<code>m4_changequote</code>, so we set a breakpoint there with the <small>GDB</small>
<code>break</code> command.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>break m4_changequote</b>
Breakpoint 1 at 0x62f4: file builtin.c, line 879.
</pre></div>

<p>Using the <code>run</code> command, we start <code>m4</code> running under <small>GDB</small>
control; as long as control does not reach the <code>m4_changequote</code>
subroutine, the program runs as usual:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>run</b>
Starting program: /work/Editorial/gdb/gnu/m4/m4
<b>define(foo,0000)</b>

<b>foo</b>
0000
</pre></div>

<p>To trigger the breakpoint, we call <code>changequote</code>.  <small>GDB</small>
suspends execution of <code>m4</code>, displaying information about the
context where it stops.
</p>
<div>
<pre><b>changequote(&lt;QUOTE&gt;,&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;)</b>

Breakpoint 1, m4_changequote (argc=3, argv=0x33c70)
    at builtin.c:879
879         if (bad_argc(TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[0]),argc,1,3))
</pre></div>

<p>Now we use the command <code>n</code> (<code>next</code>) to advance execution to
the next line of the current function.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>n</b>
882         set_quotes((argc &gt;= 2) ? TOKEN_DATA_TEXT(argv[1])\
 : nil,
</pre></div>

<p><code>set_quotes</code> looks like a promising subroutine.  We can go into it
by using the command <code>s</code> (<code>step</code>) instead of <code>next</code>.
<code>step</code> goes to the next line to be executed in <em>any</em>
subroutine, so it steps into <code>set_quotes</code>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>s</b>
set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 &#34;&lt;QUOTE&gt;&#34;, rq=0x34c88 &#34;&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;&#34;)
    at input.c:530
530         if (lquote != def_lquote)
</pre></div>

<p>The display that shows the subroutine where <code>m4</code> is now
suspended (and its arguments) is called a stack frame display.  It
shows a summary of the stack.  We can use the <code>backtrace</code>
command (which can also be spelled <code>bt</code>), to see where we are
in the stack as a whole: the <code>backtrace</code> command displays a
stack frame for each active subroutine.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>bt</b>
#0  set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 &#34;&lt;QUOTE&gt;&#34;, rq=0x34c88 &#34;&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;&#34;)
    at input.c:530
#1  0x6344 in m4_changequote (argc=3, argv=0x33c70)
    at builtin.c:882
#2  0x8174 in expand_macro (sym=0x33320) at macro.c:242
#3  0x7a88 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=209696, td=0xf7fffa30)
    at macro.c:71
#4  0x79dc in expand_input () at macro.c:40
#5  0x2930 in main (argc=0, argv=0xf7fffb20) at m4.c:195
</pre></div>

<p>We step through a few more lines to see what happens.  The first two
times, we can use ‘<samp>s</samp>’; the next two times we use <code>n</code> to avoid
falling into the <code>xstrdup</code> subroutine.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>s</b>
0x3b5c  532         if (rquote != def_rquote)
(gdb) <b>s</b>
0x3b80  535         lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == &#39;\0&#39;) ?  \
def_lquote : xstrdup(lq);
(gdb) <b>n</b>
536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == &#39;\0&#39;) ? def_rquote\
 : xstrdup(rq);
(gdb) <b>n</b>
538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);
</pre></div>

<p>The last line displayed looks a little odd; we can examine the variables
<code>lquote</code> and <code>rquote</code> to see if they are in fact the new left
and right quotes we specified.  We use the command <code>p</code>
(<code>print</code>) to see their values.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>p lquote</b>
$1 = 0x35d40 &#34;&lt;QUOTE&gt;&#34;
(gdb) <b>p rquote</b>
$2 = 0x35d50 &#34;&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;&#34;
</pre></div>

<p><code>lquote</code> and <code>rquote</code> are indeed the new left and right quotes.
To look at some context, we can display ten lines of source
surrounding the current line with the <code>l</code> (<code>list</code>) command.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>l</b>
533             xfree(rquote);
534
535         lquote = (lq == nil || *lq == &#39;\0&#39;) ? def_lquote\
 : xstrdup (lq);
536         rquote = (rq == nil || *rq == &#39;\0&#39;) ? def_rquote\
 : xstrdup (rq);
537
538         len_lquote = strlen(rquote);
539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
540     }
541
542     void
</pre></div>

<p>Let us step past the two lines that set <code>len_lquote</code> and
<code>len_rquote</code>, and then examine the values of those variables.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>n</b>
539         len_rquote = strlen(lquote);
(gdb) <b>n</b>
540     }
(gdb) <b>p len_lquote</b>
$3 = 9
(gdb) <b>p len_rquote</b>
$4 = 7
</pre></div>

<p>That certainly looks wrong, assuming <code>len_lquote</code> and
<code>len_rquote</code> are meant to be the lengths of <code>lquote</code> and
<code>rquote</code> respectively.  We can set them to better values using
the <code>p</code> command, since it can print the value of
any expression—and that expression can include subroutine calls and
assignments.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>p len_lquote=strlen(lquote)</b>
$5 = 7
(gdb) <b>p len_rquote=strlen(rquote)</b>
$6 = 9
</pre></div>

<p>Is that enough to fix the problem of using the new quotes with the
<code>m4</code> built-in <code>defn</code>?  We can allow <code>m4</code> to continue
executing with the <code>c</code> (<code>continue</code>) command, and then try the
example that caused trouble initially:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>c</b>
Continuing.

<b>define(baz,defn(&lt;QUOTE&gt;foo&lt;UNQUOTE&gt;))</b>

baz
0000
</pre></div>

<p>Success!  The new quotes now work just as well as the default ones.  The
problem seems to have been just the two typos defining the wrong
lengths.  We allow <code>m4</code> exit by giving it an EOF as input:
</p>
<div>
<pre><b>Ctrl-d</b>
Program exited normally.
</pre></div>

<p>The message ‘<samp>Program exited normally.</samp>’ is from <small>GDB</small>; it
indicates <code>m4</code> has finished executing.  We can end our <small>GDB</small>
session with the <small>GDB</small> <code>quit</code> command.

<h2>2 Getting In and Out of <small>GDB</small></h2>

<p>This chapter discusses how to start <small>GDB</small>, and how to get out of it.
The essentials are:
</p><ul>
<li> type ‘<samp>gdb</samp>’ to start <small>GDB</small>.
</li><li> type <kbd>quit</kbd>, <kbd>exit</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd> to exit.
</li></ul>



<hr/>
<a name="Invoking-GDB"></a>

<a name="Invoking-GDB-1"></a>
<h3>2.1 Invoking <small>GDB</small></h3>

<p>Invoke <small>GDB</small> by running the program <code>gdb</code>.  Once started,
<small>GDB</small> reads commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit.
</p>
<p>You can also run <code>gdb</code> with a variety of arguments and options,
to specify more of your debugging environment at the outset.
</p>
<p>The command-line options described here are designed
to cover a variety of situations; in some environments, some of these
options may effectively be unavailable.
</p>
<p>The most usual way to start <small>GDB</small> is with one argument,
specifying an executable program:
</p>


<p>You can also start with both an executable program and a core file
specified:
</p>


<p>You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument or use option
<code>-p</code>, if you want to debug a running process:
</p>
<div>
<pre>gdb <var>program</var> 1234
gdb -p 1234
</pre></div>

<p>would attach <small>GDB</small> to process <code>1234</code>.  With option <samp>-p</samp> you
can omit the <var>program</var> filename.
</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the second command-line argument requires a fairly
complete operating system; when you use <small>GDB</small> as a remote
debugger attached to a bare board, there may not be any notion of
“process”, and there is often no way to get a core dump.  <small>GDB</small>
will warn you if it is unable to attach or to read core dumps.
</p>
<p>You can optionally have <code>gdb</code> pass any arguments after the
executable file to the inferior using <code>--args</code>.  This option stops
option processing.
</p><div>
<pre>gdb --args gcc -O2 -c foo.c
</pre></div>
<p>This will cause <code>gdb</code> to debug <code>gcc</code>, and to set
<code>gcc</code>’s command-line arguments (see <a href="#Arguments">Arguments</a>) to ‘<samp>-O2 -c foo.c</samp>’.
</p>
<p>You can run <code>gdb</code> without printing the front material, which describes
<small>GDB</small>’s non-warranty, by specifying <code>--silent</code>
(or <code>-q</code>/<code>--quiet</code>):
</p>


<p>You can further control how <small>GDB</small> starts up by using command-line
options.  <small>GDB</small> itself can remind you of the options available.
</p>
<p>Type
</p>


<p>to display all available options and briefly describe their use
(‘<samp>gdb -h</samp>’ is a shorter equivalent).
</p>
<p>All options and command line arguments you give are processed
in sequential order.  The order makes a difference when the
‘<samp>-x</samp>’ option is used.
</p>



<hr/>
<a name="File-Options"></a>

<a name="Choosing-Files"></a>
<h4>2.1.1 Choosing Files</h4>

<p>When <small>GDB</small> starts, it reads any arguments other than options as
specifying an executable file and core file (or process ID).  This is
the same as if the arguments were specified by the ‘<samp>-se</samp>’ and
‘<samp>-c</samp>’ (or ‘<samp>-p</samp>’) options respectively.  (<small>GDB</small> reads the
first argument that does not have an associated option flag as
equivalent to the ‘<samp>-se</samp>’ option followed by that argument; and the
second argument that does not have an associated option flag, if any, as
equivalent to the ‘<samp>-c</samp>’/‘<samp>-p</samp>’ option followed by that argument.)
If the second argument begins with a decimal digit, <small>GDB</small> will
first attempt to attach to it as a process, and if that fails, attempt
to open it as a corefile.  If you have a corefile whose name begins with
a digit, you can prevent <small>GDB</small> from treating it as a pid by
prefixing it with <samp>./</samp>, e.g. <samp>./12345</samp>.
</p>
<p>If <small>GDB</small> has not been configured to included core file support,
such as for most embedded targets, then it will complain about a second
argument and ignore it.
</p>
<p>Many options have both long and short forms; both are shown in the
following list.  <small>GDB</small> also recognizes the long forms if you truncate
them, so long as enough of the option is present to be unambiguous.
(If you prefer, you can flag option arguments with ‘<samp>--</samp>’ rather
than ‘<samp>-</samp>’, though we illustrate the more usual convention.)

<a name="Choosing-Modes"></a>
<h4>2.1.2 Choosing Modes</h4>

<p>You can run <small>GDB</small> in various alternative modes—for example, in
batch mode or quiet mode.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="g_t_002dnx"></a></dd>
<dt><code>-nx</code></dt>
<dt><code>-n</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_002d_002dnx"></a>

</p>
<a name="g_t_002dnh"></a></dd>
<dt><code>-nh</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_002d_002dnh"></a>
<p>Do not execute commands found in any home directory initialization
file (see <a href="#Initialization-Files">Home directory initialization
file</a>).  The system wide and current directory initialization files
are still loaded.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-quiet</code></dt>
<dt><code>-silent</code></dt>
<dt><code>-q</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_002d_002dquiet"></a>
<a name="index-_002d_002dsilent"></a>
<a name="index-_002dq"></a>
<p>“Quiet”.  Do not print the introductory and copyright messages.  These
messages are also suppressed in batch mode.
</p>
<a name="index-set-startup_002dquietly"></a>
<a name="index-show-startup_002dquietly"></a>
<p>This can also be enabled using <code>set startup-quietly on</code>.  The
default is <code>off</code>.  Use <code>show startup-quietly</code> to see the
current setting.  Place <code>set startup-quietly on</code> into your early
initialization file (see <a href="#Initialization-Files">Initialization
Files</a>) to have future <small>GDB</small> sessions startup quietly.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-batch</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_002d_002dbatch"></a>
<p>Run in batch mode.  Exit with status <code>0</code> after processing all the
command files specified with ‘<samp>-x</samp>’ (and all commands from
initialization files, if not inhibited with ‘<samp>-n</samp>’).  Exit with
nonzero status if an error occurs in executing the <small>GDB</small> commands
in the command files.  Batch mode also disables pagination, sets unlimited
terminal width and height see <a href="#Screen-Size">Screen Size</a>, and acts as if <kbd>set confirm
off</kbd> were in effect (see <a href="#Messages_002fWarnings">Messages/Warnings</a>).
</p>
<p>Batch mode may be useful for running <small>GDB</small> as a filter, for
example to download and run a program on another computer; in order to
make this more useful, the message
</p>


<p>(which is ordinarily issued whenever a program running under
<small>GDB</small> control terminates) is not issued when running in batch
mode.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-batch-silent</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_002d_002dbatch_002dsilent"></a>
<p>Run in batch mode exactly like ‘<samp>-batch</samp>’, but totally silently.  All
<small>GDB</small> output to <code>stdout</code> is prevented (<code>stderr</code> is
unaffected).  This is much quieter than ‘<samp>-silent</samp>’ and would be useless
for an interactive session.
</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when using targets that give ‘<samp>Loading section</samp>’
messages, for example.
</p>
<p>Note that targets that give their output via <small>GDB</small>, as opposed to
writing directly to <code>stdout</code>, will also be made silent.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-return-child-result</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_002d_002dreturn_002dchild_002dresult"></a>
<p>The return code from <small>GDB</small> will be the return code from the child
process (the process being debugged), with the following exceptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <small>GDB</small> exits abnormally.  E.g., due to an incorrect argument or an
internal error.  In this case the exit code is the same as it would have been
without ‘<samp>-return-child-result</samp>’.
</li><li> The user quits with an explicit value.  E.g., ‘<samp>quit 1</samp>’.
</li><li> The child process never runs, or is not allowed to terminate, in which case
the exit code will be -1.
</li></ul>

<p>This option is useful in conjunction with ‘<samp>-batch</samp>’ or ‘<samp>-batch-silent</samp>’,
when <small>GDB</small> is being used as a remote program loader or simulator
interface.

<p><small>GNU</small> Emacs sets this option when it runs <small>GDB</small> as a
subprocess.  It tells <small>GDB</small> to output the full file name and line
number in a standard, recognizable fashion each time a stack frame is
displayed (which includes each time your program stops).  This
recognizable format looks like two ‘<samp>\032</samp>’ characters, followed by
the file name, line number and character position separated by colons,
and a newline.  The Emacs-to-<small>GDB</small> interface program uses the two
‘<samp>\032</samp>’ characters as a signal to display the source code for the

<dt><code>-annotate <var>level</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_002d_002dannotate"></a>
<p>This option sets the <em>annotation level</em> inside <small>GDB</small>.  Its
effect is identical to using ‘<samp>set annotate <var>level</var></samp>’
(see <a href="#Annotations">Annotations</a>).  The annotation <var>level</var> controls how much
information <small>GDB</small> prints together with its prompt, values of
expressions, source lines, and other types of output.  Level 0 is the
normal, level 1 is for use when <small>GDB</small> is run as a subprocess of
<small>GNU</small> Emacs, level 3 is the maximum annotation suitable for programs
that control <small>GDB</small>, and level 2 has been deprecated.

<h4>2.1.4 Initialization Files</h4>
<a name="index-init-file-name"></a>

<p>During startup (see <a href="#Startup">Startup</a>) <small>GDB</small> will execute commands
from several initialization files.  These initialization files use the
same syntax as <em>command files</em> (see <a href="#Command-Files">Command Files</a>) and are
processed by <small>GDB</small> in the same way.
</p>
<p>To display the list of initialization files loaded by <small>GDB</small> at
startup, in the order they will be loaded, you can use <kbd>gdb
--help</kbd>.
</p>
<a name="index-early-initialization"></a>
<p>The <em>early initialization</em> file is loaded very early in
<small>GDB</small>’s initialization process, before the interpreter
(see <a href="#Interpreters">Interpreters</a>) has been initialized, and before the default
target (see <a href="#Targets">Targets</a>) is initialized.  Only <code>set</code> or
<code>source</code> commands should be placed into an early initialization
file, and the only <code>set</code> commands that can be used are those that
control how <small>GDB</small> starts up.
</p>
<p>Commands that can be placed into an early initialization file will be
documented as such throughout this manual.  Any command that is not
documented as being suitable for an early initialization file should
instead be placed into a general initialization file.  Command files
passed to <code>--early-init-command</code> or <code>-eix</code> are also early
initialization files, with the same command restrictions.  Only
commands that can appear in an early initialization file should be
passed to <code>--early-init-eval-command</code> or <code>-eiex</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-general-initialization"></a>
<p>In contrast, the <em>general initialization</em> files are processed
later, after <small>GDB</small> has finished its own internal initialization
process, any valid command can be used in these files.
</p>
<a name="index-initialization-file"></a>
<p>Throughout the rest of this document the term <em>initialization
file</em> refers to one of the general initialization files, not the early
initialization file.  Any discussion of the early initialization file
will specifically mention that it is the early initialization file
being discussed.
</p>
<p>As the system wide and home directory initialization files are
processed before most command line options, changes to settings
(e.g. ‘<samp>set complaints</samp>’) can affect subsequent processing of
command line options and operands.
</p>
<p>The following sections describe where <small>GDB</small> looks for the early
initialization and initialization files, and the order that the files
are searched for.
</p>
<a name="Home-directory-early-initialization-files"></a>
<h4>2.1.4.1 Home directory early initialization files</h4>

<p><small>GDB</small> initially looks for an early initialization file in the
users home directory<a name="DOCF1" href="#FOOT1"><sup>1</sup></a>.  There are a number of locations that <small>GDB</small> will
search in the home directory, these locations are searched in order
and <small>GDB</small> will load the first file that it finds, and
subsequent locations will not be checked.
</p>
<p>On non-macOS hosts the locations searched are:
</p><ul>
<li> The file <samp>gdb/gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to by the
environment variable <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li><li> The file <samp>.config/gdb/gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to
by the environment variable <code>HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li><li> The file <samp>.gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to by the
environment variable <code>HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li></ul>

<p>By contrast, on macOS hosts the locations searched are:
</p><ul>
<li> The file <samp>Library/Preferences/gdb/gdbearlyinit</samp> within the
directory pointed to by the environment variable <code>HOME</code>, if it is
defined.
</li><li> The file <samp>.gdbearlyinit</samp> within the directory pointed to by the
environment variable <code>HOME</code>, if it is defined.
</li></ul>

<p>It is possible to prevent the home directory early initialization file
from being loaded using the ‘<samp>-nx</samp>’ or ‘<samp>-nh</samp>’ command line
options, see <a href="#Mode-Options">Choosing Modes</a>.
</p>
<a name="System-Wide-Init-Files"></a><a name="System-wide-initialization-files"></a>
<h4>2.1.4.2 System wide initialization files</h4>

<p>There are two locations that are searched for system wide
initialization files.  Both of these locations are always checked:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code><samp>system.gdbinit</samp></code></dt>
<dd><p>This is a single system-wide initialization file.  Its location is
specified with the <code>--with-system-gdbinit</code> configure option
(see <a href="#System_002dwide-configuration">System-wide configuration</a>).  It is loaded first when
<small>GDB</small> starts, before command line options have been processed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><samp>system.gdbinit.d</samp></code></dt>
<dd><p>This is the system-wide initialization directory.  Its location is
specified with the <code>--with-system-gdbinit-dir</code> configure option
(see <a href="#System_002dwide-configuration">System-wide configuration</a>).  Files in this directory are
loaded in alphabetical order immediately after <samp>system.gdbinit</samp>
(if enabled) when <small>GDB</small> starts, before command line options
have been processed.  Files need to have a recognized scripting
language extension (<samp>.py</samp>/<samp>.scm</samp>) or be named with a
<samp>.gdb</samp> extension to be interpreted as regular <small>GDB</small>
commands.  <small>GDB</small> will not recurse into any subdirectories of
this directory.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is possible to prevent the system wide initialization files from
being loaded using the ‘<samp>-nx</samp>’ command line option, see <a href="#Mode-Options">Choosing Modes</a>.
</p>
<a name="Home-Directory-Init-File"></a><a name="Home-directory-initialization-file"></a>
<h4>2.1.4.3 Home directory initialization file</h4>
<a name="index-gdbinit"></a>
<a name="index-_002egdbinit"></a>
<a name="index-gdb_002eini"></a>

<p>After loading the system wide initialization files <small>GDB</small> will
look for an initialization file in the users home
directory<a name="DOCF2" href="#FOOT2"><sup>2</sup></a>.  There are a
number of locations that <small>GDB</small> will search in the home
directory, these locations are searched in order and <small>GDB</small> will
load the first file that it finds, and subsequent locations will not
be checked.
</p>
<p>On non-Apple hosts the locations searched are:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gdb/gdbinit</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>$HOME/.config/gdb/gdbinit</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>$HOME/.gdbinit</samp></dt>
</dl>

<p>While on Apple hosts the locations searched are:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>$HOME/Library/Preferences/gdb/gdbinit</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>$HOME/.gdbinit</samp></dt>
</dl>

<p>It is possible to prevent the home directory initialization file from
being loaded using the ‘<samp>-nx</samp>’ or ‘<samp>-nh</samp>’ command line options,
see <a href="#Mode-Options">Choosing Modes</a>.
</p>
<p>The DJGPP port of <small>GDB</small> uses the name <samp>gdb.ini</samp> instead of
<samp>.gdbinit</samp> or <samp>gdbinit</samp>, due to the limitations of file
names imposed by DOS filesystems.  The Windows port of <small>GDB</small>
uses the standard name, but if it finds a <samp>gdb.ini</samp> file in your
home directory, it warns you about that and suggests to rename the
file to the standard name.
</p>
<a name="Init-File-in-the-Current-Directory-during-Startup"></a><a name="Local-directory-initialization-file"></a>
<h4>2.1.4.4 Local directory initialization file</h4>

<p><small>GDB</small> will check the current directory for a file called
<samp>.gdbinit</samp>.  It is loaded last, after command line options
other than ‘<samp>-x</samp>’ and ‘<samp>-ex</samp>’ have been processed.  The command
line options ‘<samp>-x</samp>’ and ‘<samp>-ex</samp>’ are processed last, after
<samp>.gdbinit</samp> has been loaded, see <a href="#File-Options">Choosing
Files</a>.
</p>
<p>If the file in the current directory was already loaded as the home
directory initialization file then it will not be loaded a second
time.
</p>
<p>It is possible to prevent the local directory initialization file from
being loaded using the ‘<samp>-nx</samp>’ command line option, see <a href="#Mode-Options">Choosing Modes</a>.

<hr/>
<a name="Shell-Commands"></a>

<a name="Shell-Commands-1"></a>
<h3>2.3 Shell Commands</h3>

<p>If you need to execute occasional shell commands during your
debugging session, there is no need to leave or suspend <small>GDB</small>; you can
just use the <code>shell</code> command.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-shell"></a>
<a name="index-_0021"></a>
<a name="index-shell-escape"></a>

<dt><code>shell <var>command-string</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>!<var>command-string</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Invoke a standard shell to execute <var>command-string</var>.
Note that no space is needed between <code>!</code> and <var>command-string</var>.
On GNU and Unix systems, the environment variable <code>SHELL</code>, if it
exists, determines which shell to run.  Otherwise <small>GDB</small> uses
the default shell (<samp>/bin/sh</samp> on GNU and Unix systems,
<samp>cmd.exe</samp> on MS-Windows, <samp>COMMAND.COM</samp> on MS-DOS, etc.).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The utility <code>make</code> is often needed in development environments.
You do not have to use the <code>shell</code> command for this purpose in
<small>GDB</small>:

<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-make"></a>

<p>In case the <var>command</var> contains a <code>|</code>, the option <code>-d <var>delim</var></code>
can be used to specify an alternate delimiter string <var>delim</var> that separates
the <var>command</var> from the <var>shell_command</var>.
</p>
<p>Example:
</p><div>

</p><hr/>
<a name="Commands"></a>

<a name="GDB-Commands"></a>
<h2>3 <small>GDB</small> Commands</h2>

<p>You can abbreviate a <small>GDB</small> command to the first few letters of the command
name, if that abbreviation is unambiguous; and you can repeat certain
<small>GDB</small> commands by typing just <tt>RET</tt>.  You can also use the <tt>TAB</tt>
key to get <small>GDB</small> to fill out the rest of a word in a command (or to
show you the alternatives available, if there is more than one possibility).
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Command-Syntax"></a>

<a name="Command-Syntax-1"></a>
<h3>3.1 Command Syntax</h3>

<p>A <small>GDB</small> command is a single line of input.  There is no limit on
how long it can be.  It starts with a command name, which is followed by
arguments whose meaning depends on the command name.  For example, the
command <code>step</code> accepts an argument which is the number of times to
step, as in ‘<samp>step 5</samp>’.  You can also use the <code>step</code> command
with no arguments.  Some commands do not allow any arguments.
</p>
<a name="index-abbreviation"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> command names may always be truncated if that abbreviation is
unambiguous.  Other possible command abbreviations are listed in the
documentation for individual commands.  In some cases, even ambiguous
abbreviations are allowed; for example, <code>s</code> is specially defined as
equivalent to <code>step</code> even though there are other commands whose
names start with <code>s</code>.  You can test abbreviations by using them as
arguments to the <code>help</code> command.
</p>
<a name="index-repeating-commands"></a>
<a name="index-RET-_0028repeat-last-command_0029"></a>
<p>A blank line as input to <small>GDB</small> (typing just <tt>RET</tt>) means to
repeat the previous command.  Certain commands (for example, <code>run</code>)
will not repeat this way; these are commands whose unintentional
repetition might cause trouble and which you are unlikely to want to
repeat.  User-defined commands can disable this feature; see
<a href="#Define">dont-repeat</a>.
</p>
<p>The <code>list</code> and <code>x</code> commands, when you repeat them with
<tt>RET</tt>, construct new arguments rather than repeating
exactly as typed.  This permits easy scanning of source or memory.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> can also use <tt>RET</tt> in another way: to partition lengthy
output, in a way similar to the common utility <code>more</code>
(see <a href="#Screen-Size">Screen Size</a>).  Since it is easy to press one
<tt>RET</tt> too many in this situation, <small>GDB</small> disables command
repetition after any command that generates this sort of display.
</p>
<a name="index-_0023-_0028a-comment_0029"></a>
<a name="index-comment"></a>
<p>Any text from a <kbd>#</kbd> to the end of the line is a comment; it does
nothing.  This is useful mainly in command files (see <a href="#Command-Files">Command Files</a>).
</p>
<a name="index-repeating-command-sequences"></a>
<a name="index-Ctrl_002do-_0028operate_002dand_002dget_002dnext_0029"></a>
<p>The <kbd>Ctrl-o</kbd> binding is useful for repeating a complex sequence of
commands.  This command accepts the current line, like <tt>RET</tt>, and
then fetches the next line relative to the current line from the history
for editing.
</p>

<hr/>
<a name="Command-Settings"></a>

<a name="Command-Settings-1"></a>
<h3>3.2 Command Settings</h3>
<a name="index-default-behavior-of-commands_002c-changing"></a>
<a name="index-default-settings_002c-changing"></a>

<p>Many commands change their behavior according to command-specific
variables or settings.  These settings can be changed with the
<code>set</code> subcommands.  For example, the <code>print</code> command
(see <a href="#Data">Examining Data</a>) prints arrays differently depending on
settings changeable with the commands <code>set print elements
NUMBER-OF-ELEMENTS</code> and <code>set print array-indexes</code>, among others.
</p>
<p>You can change these settings to your preference in the gdbinit files
loaded at <small>GDB</small> startup.  See <a href="#Startup">Startup</a>.
</p>
<p>The settings can also be changed interactively during the debugging
session.  For example, to change the limit of array elements to print,
you can do the following:
</p><div>
<pre>(GDB) set print elements 10
(GDB) print some_array
$1 = {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90...}
</pre></div>

<p>The above <code>set print elements 10</code> command changes the number of
elements to print from the default of 200 to 10.  If you only intend
this limit of 10 to be used for printing <code>some_array</code>, then you
must restore the limit back to 200, with <code>set print elements
200</code>.
</p>
<p>Some commands allow overriding settings with command options.  For
example, the <code>print</code> command supports a number of options that
allow overriding relevant global print settings as set by <code>set
print</code> subcommands.  See <a href="#print-options">print options</a>.  The example above could be
rewritten as:
</p><div>
<pre>(GDB) print -elements 10 -- some_array
$1 = {0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90...}
</pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can use the <code>with</code> command to change a setting
temporarily, for the duration of a command invocation.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-with-command"></a>
<a name="index-w-_0028with_0029"></a>
<a name="index-settings"></a>
<a name="index-temporarily-change-settings"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>with <var>setting</var> [<var>value</var>] [-- <var>command</var>]</code></dt>
<dt><code>w <var>setting</var> [<var>value</var>] [-- <var>command</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Temporarily set <var>setting</var> to <var>value</var> for the duration of
<var>command</var>.
</p>
<p><var>setting</var> is any setting you can change with the <code>set</code>
subcommands.  <var>value</var> is the value to assign to <code>setting</code>
while running <code>command</code>.
</p>
<p>If no <var>command</var> is provided, the last command executed is
repeated.
</p>
<p>If a <var>command</var> is provided, it must be preceded by a double dash
(<code>--</code>) separator.  This is required because some settings accept
free-form arguments, such as expressions or filenames.
</p>
<p>For example, the command
</p><div>
<pre>(GDB) with print array on -- print some_array
</pre></div>
<p>is equivalent to the following 3 commands:
</p><div>
<pre>(GDB) set print array on
(GDB) print some_array
(GDB) set print array off
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>with</code> command is particularly useful when you want to
override a setting while running user-defined commands, or commands
defined in Python or Guile.  See <a href="#Extending-GDB">Extending GDB</a>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(GDB) with print pretty on -- my_complex_command
</pre></div>

<p>To change several settings for the same command, you can nest
<code>with</code> commands.  For example, <code>with language ada -- with
print elements 10</code> temporarily changes the language to Ada and sets a
limit of 10 elements to print for arrays and strings.

<h3>3.3 Command Completion</h3>

<a name="index-completion"></a>
<a name="index-word-completion"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> can fill in the rest of a word in a command for you, if there is
only one possibility; it can also show you what the valid possibilities
are for the next word in a command, at any time.  This works for <small>GDB</small>
commands, <small>GDB</small> subcommands, command options, and the names of symbols
in your program.
</p>
<p>Press the <tt>TAB</tt> key whenever you want <small>GDB</small> to fill out the rest
of a word.  If there is only one possibility, <small>GDB</small> fills in the
word, and waits for you to finish the command (or press <tt>RET</tt> to
enter it).  For example, if you type
</p>


<p><small>GDB</small> fills in the rest of the word ‘<samp>breakpoints</samp>’, since that is
the only <code>info</code> subcommand beginning with ‘<samp>bre</samp>’:
</p>


<p>You can either press <tt>RET</tt> at this point, to run the <code>info
breakpoints</code> command, or backspace and enter something else, if
‘<samp>breakpoints</samp>’ does not look like the command you expected.  (If you
were sure you wanted <code>info breakpoints</code> in the first place, you
might as well just type <tt>RET</tt> immediately after ‘<samp>info bre</samp>’,
to exploit command abbreviations rather than command completion).
</p>
<p>If there is more than one possibility for the next word when you press
<tt>TAB</tt>, <small>GDB</small> sounds a bell.  You can either supply more
characters and try again, or just press <tt>TAB</tt> a second time;
<small>GDB</small> displays all the possible completions for that word.  For
example, you might want to set a breakpoint on a subroutine whose name
begins with ‘<samp>make_</samp>’, but when you type <kbd>b make_<span>TAB</span></kbd> <small>GDB</small>
just sounds the bell.  Typing <tt>TAB</tt> again displays all the
function names in your program that begin with those characters, for
example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) b make_ <span>TAB</span>
</pre><pre>GDB sounds bell; press <span>TAB</span> again, to see:
</pre><pre>make_a_section_from_file     make_environ
make_abs_section             make_function_type
make_blockvector             make_pointer_type
make_cleanup                 make_reference_type
make_command                 make_symbol_completion_list
(gdb) b make_
</pre></div>

<p>After displaying the available possibilities, <small>GDB</small> copies your
partial input (‘<samp>b make_</samp>’ in the example) so you can finish the
command.
</p>
<p>If you just want to see the list of alternatives in the first place, you
can press <kbd>M-?</kbd> rather than pressing <tt>TAB</tt> twice.  <kbd>M-?</kbd>
means <kbd><span>META</span> ?</kbd>.  You can type this either by holding down a
key designated as the <tt>META</tt> shift on your keyboard (if there is
one) while typing <kbd>?</kbd>, or as <tt>ESC</tt> followed by <kbd>?</kbd>.
</p>
<p>If the number of possible completions is large, <small>GDB</small> will
print as much of the list as it has collected, as well as a message
indicating that the list may be truncated.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) b m<span>TAB</span><span>TAB</span>
main
&lt;... the rest of the possible completions ...&gt;
*** List may be truncated, max-completions reached. ***
(gdb) b m
</pre></div>

<p>This behavior can be controlled with the following commands:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-max_002dcompletions"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set max-completions <var>limit</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>set max-completions unlimited</code></dt>
<dd><p>Set the maximum number of completion candidates.  <small>GDB</small> will
stop looking for more completions once it collects this many candidates.
This is useful when completing on things like function names as collecting
all the possible candidates can be time consuming.
The default value is 200.  A value of zero disables tab-completion.
Note that setting either no limit or a very large limit can make
completion slow.
<a name="index-show-max_002dcompletions"></a>
</p></dd>
<dt><code>show max-completions</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show the maximum number of candidates that <small>GDB</small> will collect and show
during completion.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-quotes-in-commands"></a>
<a name="index-completion-of-quoted-strings"></a>
<p>Sometimes the string you need, while logically a “word”, may contain
parentheses or other characters that <small>GDB</small> normally excludes from
its notion of a word.  To permit word completion to work in this
situation, you may enclose words in <code>&#39;</code> (single quote marks) in
<small>GDB</small> commands.
</p>
<p>A likely situation where you might need this is in typing an
expression that involves a C<tt>++</tt> symbol name with template
parameters.  This is because when completing expressions, GDB treats
the ‘<samp>&lt;</samp>’ character as word delimiter, assuming that it’s the
less-than comparison operator (see <a href="#C-Operators">C and C<tt>++</tt>
Operators</a>).
</p>
<p>For example, when you want to call a C<tt>++</tt> template function
interactively using the <code>print</code> or <code>call</code> commands, you may
need to distinguish whether you mean the version of <code>name</code> that
was specialized for <code>int</code>, <code>name&lt;int&gt;()</code>, or the version
that was specialized for <code>float</code>, <code>name&lt;float&gt;()</code>.  To use
the word-completion facilities in this situation, type a single quote
<code>&#39;</code> at the beginning of the function name.  This alerts
<small>GDB</small> that it may need to consider more information than usual
when you press <tt>TAB</tt> or <kbd>M-?</kbd> to request word completion:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) p &#39;func&lt; <kbd>M-?</kbd>
func&lt;int&gt;()    func&lt;float&gt;()
(gdb) p &#39;func&lt;
</pre></div>

<p>When setting breakpoints however (see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>), you don’t
usually need to type a quote before the function name, because
<small>GDB</small> understands that you want to set a breakpoint on a
function:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) b func&lt; <kbd>M-?</kbd>
func&lt;int&gt;()    func&lt;float&gt;()
(gdb) b func&lt;
</pre></div>

<p>This is true even in the case of typing the name of C<tt>++</tt> overloaded
functions (multiple definitions of the same function, distinguished by
argument type).  For example, when you want to set a breakpoint you
don’t need to distinguish whether you mean the version of <code>name</code>
that takes an <code>int</code> parameter, <code>name(int)</code>, or the version
that takes a <code>float</code> parameter, <code>name(float)</code>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) b bubble( <kbd>M-?</kbd>
bubble(int)    bubble(double)
(gdb) b bubble(dou <kbd>M-?</kbd>
bubble(double)
</pre></div>

<p>See <a href="#quoting-names">quoting names</a> for a description of other scenarios that
require quoting.
</p>
<p>For more information about overloaded functions, see <a href="#C-Plus-Plus-Expressions">C<tt>++</tt> Expressions</a>.  You can use the command <code>set
overload-resolution off</code> to disable overload resolution;
see <a href="#Debugging-C-Plus-Plus"><small>GDB</small> Features for C<tt>++</tt></a>.

<a name="index-structure-field-name-completion"></a>
<a name="index-completion-of-union-field-names"></a>
<a name="index-union-field-name-completion"></a>
<p>When completing in an expression which looks up a field in a
structure, <small>GDB</small> also tries<a name="DOCF3" href="#FOOT3"><sup>3</sup></a> to
limit completions to the field names available in the type of the
left-hand-side:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) p gdb_stdout.<kbd>M-?</kbd>
magic                to_fputs             to_rewind
to_data              to_isatty            to_write
to_delete            to_put               to_write_async_safe
to_flush             to_read
</pre></div>

<p>This is because the <code>gdb_stdout</code> is a variable of the type
<code>struct ui_file</code> that is defined in <small>GDB</small> sources as
follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre>struct ui_file
{
   int *magic;
   ui_file_flush_ftype *to_flush;
   ui_file_write_ftype *to_write;

<a name="Command-Options"></a>

<a name="Command-options"></a>
<h3>3.4 Command options</h3>

<a name="index-command-options"></a>
<p>Some commands accept options starting with a leading dash.  For
example, <code>print -pretty</code>.  Similarly to command names, you can
abbreviate a <small>GDB</small> option to the first few letters of the
option name, if that abbreviation is unambiguous, and you can also use
the <tt>TAB</tt> key to get <small>GDB</small> to fill out the rest of a word
in an option (or to show you the alternatives available, if there is
more than one possibility).
</p>
<a name="index-command-options_002c-raw-input"></a>
<p>Some commands take raw input as argument.  For example, the print
command processes arbitrary expressions in any of the languages
supported by <small>GDB</small>.  With such commands, because raw input may
start with a leading dash that would be confused with an option or any
of its abbreviations, e.g. <code>print -p</code> (short for <code>print
-pretty</code> or printing negative <code>p</code>?), if you specify any command
option, then you must use a double-dash (<code>--</code>) delimiter to
indicate the end of options.
</p>
<a name="index-command-options_002c-boolean"></a>

<p>Some options are described as accepting an argument which can be
either <code>on</code> or <code>off</code>.  These are known as <em>boolean
options</em>.  Similarly to boolean settings commands—<code>on</code> and
<code>off</code> are the typical values, but any of <code>1</code>, <code>yes</code> and
<code>enable</code> can also be used as “true” value, and any of <code>0</code>,
<code>no</code> and <code>disable</code> can also be used as “false” value.  You
can also omit a “true” value, as it is implied by default.
</p>
<p>For example, these are equivalent:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print -object on -pretty off -element unlimited -- *myptr
(gdb) p -o -p 0 -e u -- *myptr
</pre></div>

<p>You can discover the set of options some command accepts by completing
on <code>-</code> after the command name.  For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print -<span>TAB</span><span>TAB</span>
-address         -max-depth               -pretty          -symbol
-array           -memory-tag-violations   -raw-values      -union
-array-indexes   -null-stop               -repeats         -vtbl
-elements        -object                  -static-members
</pre></div>

<p>Completion will in some cases guide you with a suggestion of what kind
of argument an option expects.  For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print -elements <span>TAB</span><span>TAB</span>
NUMBER     unlimited
</pre></div>

<p>Here, the option expects a number (e.g., <code>100</code>), not literal
<code>NUMBER</code>.  Such metasyntactical arguments are always presented in
uppercase.

<h2>4 Running Programs Under <small>GDB</small></h2>

<p>When you run a program under <small>GDB</small>, you must first generate
debugging information when you compile it.
</p>
<p>You may start <small>GDB</small> with its arguments, if any, in an environment
of your choice.  If you are doing native debugging, you may redirect
your program’s input and output, debug an already running process, or
kill a child process.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Compilation"></a>

<a name="Compiling-for-Debugging"></a>
<h3>4.1 Compiling for Debugging</h3>

<p>In order to debug a program effectively, you need to generate
debugging information when you compile it.  This debugging information
is stored in the object file; it describes the data type of each
variable or function and the correspondence between source line numbers
and addresses in the executable code.
</p>
<p>To request debugging information, specify the ‘<samp>-g</samp>’ option when you run
the compiler.
</p>
<p>Programs that are to be shipped to your customers are compiled with
optimizations, using the ‘<samp>-O</samp>’ compiler option.  However, some
compilers are unable to handle the ‘<samp>-g</samp>’ and ‘<samp>-O</samp>’ options
together.  Using those compilers, you cannot generate optimized
executables containing debugging information.
</p>
<p><small>GCC</small>, the <small>GNU</small> C/C<tt>++</tt> compiler, supports ‘<samp>-g</samp>’ with or
without ‘<samp>-O</samp>’, making it possible to debug optimized code.  We
recommend that you <em>always</em> use ‘<samp>-g</samp>’ whenever you compile a
program.  You may think your program is correct, but there is no sense
in pushing your luck.  For more information, see <a href="#Optimized-Code">Optimized Code</a>.
</p>
<p>Older versions of the <small>GNU</small> C compiler permitted a variant option
‘<samp><span>-gg</span></samp>’<!-- /@w --> for debugging information.  <small>GDB</small> no longer supports this
format; if your <small>GNU</small> C compiler has this option, do not use it.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> knows about preprocessor macros and can show you their
expansion (see <a href="#Macros">Macros</a>).  Most compilers do not include information
about preprocessor macros in the debugging information if you specify
the <samp>-g</samp> flag alone.  Version 3.1 and later of <small>GCC</small>,
the <small>GNU</small> C compiler, provides macro information if you are using
the DWARF debugging format, and specify the option <samp>-g3</samp>.
</p>
<p>See <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html#Debugging-Options">Options for Debugging Your Program or GCC</a> in <cite>Using the <small>GNU</small> Compiler Collection (GCC)</cite>, for more
information on <small>GCC</small> options affecting debug information.
</p>
<p>You will have the best debugging experience if you use the latest
version of the DWARF debugging format that your compiler supports.
DWARF is currently the most expressive and best supported debugging
format in <small>GDB</small>.

receives from its superior.  <small>GDB</small> provides ways to specify this
information, which you must do <em>before</em> starting your program.  (You
can change it after starting your program, but such changes only affect
your program the next time you start it.)  This information may be
divided into four categories:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>The <em>arguments.</em></dt>
<dd><p>Specify the arguments to give your program as the arguments of the
<code>run</code> command.  If a shell is available on your target, the shell
is used to pass the arguments, so that you may use normal conventions
(such as wildcard expansion or variable substitution) in describing
the arguments.
In Unix systems, you can control which shell is used with the
<code>SHELL</code> environment variable.  If you do not define <code>SHELL</code>,
<small>GDB</small> uses the default shell (<samp>/bin/sh</samp>).  You can disable
use of any shell with the <code>set startup-with-shell</code> command (see
below for details).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>The <em>environment.</em></dt>
<dd><p>Your program normally inherits its environment from <small>GDB</small>, but you can
use the <small>GDB</small> commands <code>set environment</code> and <code>unset
environment</code> to change parts of the environment that affect
your program.  See <a href="#Environment">Your Program’s Environment</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>The <em>working directory.</em></dt>
<dd><p>You can set your program’s working directory with the command
<kbd>set cwd</kbd>.  If you do not set any working directory with this
command, your program will inherit <small>GDB</small>’s working directory if
native debugging, or the remote server’s working directory if remote
debugging.  See <a href="#Working-Directory">Your Program’s Working
Directory</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>The <em>standard input and output.</em></dt>
<dd><p>Your program normally uses the same device for standard input and
standard output as <small>GDB</small> is using.  You can redirect input and output
in the <code>run</code> command line, or you can use the <code>tty</code> command to
set a different device for your program.
See <a href="#Input_002fOutput">Your Program’s Input and Output</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-pipes"></a>
<p><em>Warning:</em> While input and output redirection work, you cannot use
pipes to pass the output of the program you are debugging to another
program; if you attempt this, <small>GDB</small> is likely to wind up debugging the
wrong program.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>When you issue the <code>run</code> command, your program begins to execute
immediately.  See <a href="#Stopping">Stopping and Continuing</a>, for discussion
of how to arrange for your program to stop.  Once your program has
stopped, you may call functions in your program, using the <code>print</code>
or <code>call</code> commands.  See <a href="#Data">Examining Data</a>.
</p>
<p>If the modification time of your symbol file has changed since the last
time <small>GDB</small> read its symbols, <small>GDB</small> discards its symbol
table, and reads it again.  When it does this, <small>GDB</small> tries to retain
your current breakpoints.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-start"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>start</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-run-to-main-procedure"></a>
<p>The name of the main procedure can vary from language to language.
With C or C<tt>++</tt>, the main procedure name is always <code>main</code>, but
other languages such as Ada do not require a specific name for their
main procedure.  The debugger provides a convenient way to start the
execution of the program and to stop at the beginning of the main
procedure, depending on the language used.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>start</samp>’ command does the equivalent of setting a temporary
breakpoint at the beginning of the main procedure and then invoking
the ‘<samp>run</samp>’ command.
</p>
<a name="index-elaboration-phase"></a>
<p>Some programs contain an <em>elaboration</em> phase where some startup code is
executed before the main procedure is called.  This depends on the
languages used to write your program.  In C<tt>++</tt>, for instance,
constructors for static and global objects are executed before
<code>main</code> is called.  It is therefore possible that the debugger stops
before reaching the main procedure.  However, the temporary breakpoint
will remain to halt execution.
</p>
<p>Specify the arguments to give to your program as arguments to the
‘<samp>start</samp>’ command.  These arguments will be given verbatim to the
underlying ‘<samp>run</samp>’ command.  Note that the same arguments will be
reused if no argument is provided during subsequent calls to
‘<samp>start</samp>’ or ‘<samp>run</samp>’.
</p>
<p>It is sometimes necessary to debug the program during elaboration.  In
these cases, using the <code>start</code> command would stop the execution
of your program too late, as the program would have already completed
the elaboration phase.  Under these circumstances, either insert
breakpoints in your elaboration code before running your program or
use the <code>starti</code> command.
</p>
<a name="index-starti"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>starti</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-run-to-first-instruction"></a>
<p>The ‘<samp>starti</samp>’ command does the equivalent of setting a temporary
breakpoint at the first instruction of a program’s execution and then
invoking the ‘<samp>run</samp>’ command.  For programs containing an
elaboration phase, the <code>starti</code> command will stop execution at
the start of the elaboration phase.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>set exec-wrapper <var>wrapper</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>show exec-wrapper</code></dt>
<dt><code>unset exec-wrapper</code></dt>
<dd><p>When ‘<samp>exec-wrapper</samp>’ is set, the specified wrapper is used to
launch programs for debugging.  <small>GDB</small> starts your program
with a shell command of the form <kbd>exec <var>wrapper</var>
<var>program</var></kbd>.  Quoting is added to <var>program</var> and its
arguments, but not to <var>wrapper</var>, so you should add quotes if
appropriate for your shell.  The wrapper runs until it executes
your program, and then <small>GDB</small> takes control.
</p>
<p>You can use any program that eventually calls <code>execve</code> with
its arguments as a wrapper.  Several standard Unix utilities do
this, e.g. <code>env</code> and <code>nohup</code>.  Any Unix shell script ending
with <code>exec &#34;$@&#34;</code> will also work.
</p>
<p>For example, you can use <code>env</code> to pass an environment variable to
the debugged program, without setting the variable in your shell’s
environment:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) set exec-wrapper env &#39;LD_PRELOAD=libtest.so&#39;
(gdb) run
</pre></div>

<p>This command is available when debugging locally on most targets, excluding
<small>DJGPP</small>, Cygwin, MS Windows, and QNX Neutrino.

<dd><p>On Unix systems, by default, if a shell is available on your target,
<small>GDB</small>) uses it to start your program.  Arguments of the
<code>run</code> command are passed to the shell, which does variable
substitution, expands wildcard characters and performs redirection of
I/O.  In some circumstances, it may be useful to disable such use of a
shell, for example, when debugging the shell itself or diagnosing
startup failures such as:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) run
Starting program: ./a.out
During startup program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
</pre></div>

<p>which indicates the shell or the wrapper specified with
‘<samp>exec-wrapper</samp>’ crashed, not your program.  Most often, this is
caused by something odd in your shell’s non-interactive mode
initialization file—such as <samp>.cshrc</samp> for C-shell,
$<samp>.zshenv</samp> for the Z shell, or the file specified in the
<code>BASH_ENV</code> environment variable for BASH.

<dd>
<p>By default, if the current inferior is not connected to any target yet
(e.g., with <code>target remote</code>), the <code>run</code> command starts your
program as a native process under <small>GDB</small>, on your local machine.
If you’re sure you don’t want to debug programs on your local machine,
you can tell <small>GDB</small> to not connect to the native target
automatically with the <code>set auto-connect-native-target off</code>
command.
</p>
<p>If <code>on</code>, which is the default, and if the current inferior is not
connected to a target already, the <code>run</code> command automaticaly
connects to the native target, if one is available.
</p>
<p>If <code>off</code>, and if the current inferior is not connected to a
target already, the <code>run</code> command fails with an error:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) run
Don&#39;t know how to run.  Try &#34;help target&#34;.
</pre></div>

<p>If the current inferior is already connected to a target, <small>GDB</small>
always uses it with the <code>run</code> command.
</p>
<p>In any case, you can explicitly connect to the native target with the
<code>target native</code> command.  For example,
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) set auto-connect-native-target off
(gdb) run
Don&#39;t know how to run.  Try &#34;help target&#34;.
(gdb) target native
(gdb) run
Starting program: ./a.out
[Inferior 1 (process 10421) exited normally]
</pre></div>

<p>In case you connected explicitly to the <code>native</code> target,
<small>GDB</small> remains connected even if all inferiors exit, ready for
the next <code>run</code> command.  Use the <code>disconnect</code> command to
disconnect.
</p>
<p>Examples of other commands that likewise respect the
<code>auto-connect-native-target</code> setting: <code>attach</code>, <code>info

<dd><p>This option (enabled by default in <small>GDB</small>) will turn off the native
randomization of the virtual address space of the started program.  This option
is useful for multiple debugging sessions to make the execution better
reproducible and memory addresses reusable across debugging sessions.
</p>
<p>This feature is implemented only on certain targets, including <small>GNU</small>/Linux.
On <small>GNU</small>/Linux you can get the same behavior using

<div>
<pre>(gdb) set exec-wrapper setarch `uname -m` -R

<dd><p>Leave the behavior of the started executable unchanged.  Some bugs rear their
ugly heads only when the program is loaded at certain addresses.  If your bug
disappears when you run the program under <small>GDB</small>, that might be because
<small>GDB</small> by default disables the address randomization on platforms, such
as <small>GNU</small>/Linux, which do that for stand-alone programs.  Use <kbd>set
disable-randomization off</kbd> to try to reproduce such elusive bugs.
</p>
<p>On targets where it is available, virtual address space randomization
protects the programs against certain kinds of security attacks.  In these
cases the attacker needs to know the exact location of a concrete executable
code.  Randomizing its location makes it impossible to inject jumps misusing
a code at its expected addresses.
</p>
<p>Prelinking shared libraries provides a startup performance advantage but it
makes addresses in these libraries predictable for privileged processes by
having just unprivileged access at the target system.  Reading the shared
library binary gives enough information for assembling the malicious code
misusing it.  Still even a prelinked shared library can get loaded at a new
random address just requiring the regular relocation process during the
startup.  Shared libraries not already prelinked are always loaded at
a randomly chosen address.
</p>
<p>Position independent executables (PIE) contain position independent code
similar to the shared libraries and therefore such executables get loaded at
a randomly chosen address upon startup.  PIE executables always load even
already prelinked shared libraries at a random address.  You can build such
executable using <code>gcc -fPIE -pie</code>.
</p>
<p>Heap (malloc storage), stack and custom mmap areas are always placed randomly
(as long as the randomization is enabled).

<a name="index-arguments-_0028to-your-program_0029"></a>
<p>The arguments to your program can be specified by the arguments of the

They are passed to a shell, which expands wildcard characters and
performs redirection of I/O, and thence to your program.  Your

<small>GDB</small> uses.  If you do not define <code>SHELL</code>, <small>GDB</small> uses
the default shell (<samp>/bin/sh</samp> on Unix).
</p>
<p>On non-Unix systems, the program is usually invoked directly by
<small>GDB</small>, which emulates I/O redirection via the appropriate system
calls, and the wildcard characters are expanded by the startup code of
the program, not by the shell.

<h3>4.4 Your Program’s Environment</h3>

<a name="index-environment-_0028of-your-program_0029"></a>
<p>The <em>environment</em> consists of a set of environment variables and
their values.  Environment variables conventionally record such things as
your user name, your home directory, your terminal type, and your search
path for programs to run.  Usually you set up environment variables with
the shell and they are inherited by all the other programs you run.  When
debugging, it can be useful to try running your program with a modified
environment without having to start <small>GDB</small> over again.

You may specify several directory names, separated by whitespace or by a
system-dependent separator character (‘<samp>:</samp>’ on Unix, ‘<samp>;</samp>’ on
MS-DOS and MS-Windows).  If <var>directory</var> is already in the path, it
is moved to the front, so it is searched sooner.
</p>
<p>You can use the string ‘<samp>$cwd</samp>’ to refer to whatever is the current

use ‘<samp>.</samp>’ instead, it refers to the directory where you executed the

values of environment variables are just strings, and any
interpretation is supplied by your program itself.  The <var>value</var>
parameter is optional; if it is eliminated, the variable is set to a
null value.
</p>
<p>For example, this command:
</p>


<p>tells the debugged program, when subsequently run, that its user is named
‘<samp>foo</samp>’.  (The spaces around ‘<samp>=</samp>’ are used for clarity here; they
are not actually required.)
</p>
<p>Note that on Unix systems, <small>GDB</small> runs your program via a shell,
which also inherits the environment set with <code>set environment</code>.
If necessary, you can avoid that by using the ‘<samp>env</samp>’ program as a
wrapper instead of using <code>set environment</code>.  See <a href="#set-exec_002dwrapper">set exec-wrapper</a>, for an example doing just that.

non-interactively—such as <samp>.cshrc</samp> for C-shell, $<samp>.zshenv</samp>
for the Z shell, or the file specified in the <code>BASH_ENV</code>
environment variable for BASH—any variables you set in that file
affect your program.  You may wish to move setting of environment
variables to files that are only run when you sign on, such as
<samp>.login</samp> or <samp>.profile</samp>.

<p>By default, the program you run under <small>GDB</small> does input and output to
the same terminal that <small>GDB</small> uses.  <small>GDB</small> switches the terminal
to its own terminal modes to interact with you, but it records the terminal

<a name="index-controlling-terminal"></a>
<p>Another way to specify where your program should do input and output is
with the <code>tty</code> command.  This command accepts a file name as

commands.  It also resets the controlling terminal for the child
process, for future <code>run</code> commands.  For example,
</p>


<p>directs that processes started with subsequent <code>run</code> commands
default to do input and output on the terminal <samp>/dev/ttyb</samp> and have
that as their controlling terminal.
</p>
<p>An explicit redirection in <code>run</code> overrides the <code>tty</code> command’s
effect on the input/output device, but not its effect on the controlling
terminal.
</p>
<p>When you use the <code>tty</code> command or redirect input in the <code>run</code>

<p>To use <code>attach</code>, your program must be running in an environment
which supports processes; for example, <code>attach</code> does not work for
programs on bare-board targets that lack an operating system.  You must
also have permission to send the process a signal.
</p>
<p>When you use <code>attach</code>, the debugger finds the program running in
the process first by looking in the current working directory, then (if
the program is not found) by using the source file search path
(see <a href="#Source-Path">Specifying Source Directories</a>).  You can also use
the <code>file</code> command to load the program.  See <a href="#Files">Commands to
Specify Files</a>.

<a name="set-exec_002dfile_002dmismatch"></a><p>If the debugger can determine that the executable file running in the
process it is attaching to does not match the current exec-file loaded

comparing their build IDs (see <a href="#build-ID">build ID</a>), if available.

<p>The first thing <small>GDB</small> does after arranging to debug the specified
process is to stop it.  You can examine and modify an attached process
with all the <small>GDB</small> commands that are ordinarily available when
you start processes with <code>run</code>.  You can insert breakpoints; you
can step and continue; you can modify storage.  If you would rather the
process continue running, you may use the <code>continue</code> command after
attaching <small>GDB</small> to the process.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-detach"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>detach</code></dt>
<dd><p>When you have finished debugging the attached process, you can use the
<code>detach</code> command to release it from <small>GDB</small> control.  Detaching
the process continues its execution.  After the <code>detach</code> command,
that process and <small>GDB</small> become completely independent once more, and you
are ready to <code>attach</code> another process or start one with <code>run</code>.
<code>detach</code> does not repeat if you press <tt>RET</tt> again after
executing the command.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If you exit <small>GDB</small> while you have an attached process, you detach
that process.  If you use the <code>run</code> command, you kill that process.
By default, <small>GDB</small> asks for confirmation if you try to do either of these
things; you can control whether or not you need to confirm by using the
<code>set confirm</code> command (see <a href="#Messages_002fWarnings">Optional Warnings and

<dd><p>Kill the child process in which your program is running under <small>GDB</small>.

<p>This command is useful if you wish to debug a core dump instead of a
running process.  <small>GDB</small> ignores any core dump file while your program
is running.
</p>
<p>On some operating systems, a program cannot be executed outside <small>GDB</small>
while you have breakpoints set on it inside <small>GDB</small>.  You can use the
<code>kill</code> command in this situation to permit running your program
outside the debugger.
</p>
<p>The <code>kill</code> command is also useful if you wish to recompile and
relink your program, since on many systems it is impossible to modify an
executable file while it is running in a process.  In this case, when you
next type <code>run</code>, <small>GDB</small> notices that the file has changed, and
reads the symbol table again (while trying to preserve your current
breakpoint settings).

<h3>4.9 Debugging Multiple Inferiors Connections and Programs</h3>

<p><small>GDB</small> lets you run and debug multiple programs in a single
session.  In addition, <small>GDB</small> on some systems may let you run
several programs simultaneously (otherwise you have to exit from one
before starting another).  On some systems <small>GDB</small> may even let
you debug several programs simultaneously on different remote systems.
In the most general case, you can have multiple threads of execution
in each of multiple processes, launched from multiple executables,
running on different machines.
</p>
<a name="index-inferior"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> represents the state of each program execution with an
object called an <em>inferior</em>.  An inferior typically corresponds to
a process, but is more general and applies also to targets that do not
have processes.  Inferiors may be created before a process runs, and
may be retained after a process exits.  Inferiors have unique
identifiers that are different from process ids.  Usually each
inferior will also have its own distinct address space, although some
embedded targets may have several inferiors running in different parts
of a single address space.  Each inferior may in turn have multiple
threads running in it.
</p>
<p>To find out what inferiors exist at any moment, use <code>info inferiors</code><!-- /@w -->:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-info-inferiors-_005b-id_2026-_005d"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>info inferiors</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print a list of all inferiors currently being managed by <small>GDB</small>.
By default all inferiors are printed, but the argument <var>id</var>…
– a space separated list of inferior numbers – can be used to limit
the display to just the requested inferiors.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> displays for each inferior (in this order):
</p>
<ol>
<li> the inferior number assigned by <small>GDB</small>

</li><li> the target system’s inferior identifier

</li><li> the target connection the inferior is bound to, including the unique
connection number assigned by <small>GDB</small>, and the protocol used by
the connection.

</li><li> the name of the executable the inferior is running.

</li></ol>

<p>An asterisk ‘<samp>*</samp>’ preceding the <small>GDB</small> inferior number
indicates the current inferior.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p></dd>
</dl>

<div>
<pre>(gdb) info inferiors
  Num  Description       Connection                      Executable

  2    process 2307      2 (extended-remote host:10000)  hello
</pre></div>

<p>To get informations about the current inferior, use <code>inferior</code>:

</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> displays for each connection (in this order):

<ol>
<li> the connection number assigned by <small>GDB</small>.

</li><li> the protocol used by the connection.

</li><li> a textual description of the protocol used by the connection.

</li></ol>

<p>An asterisk ‘<samp>*</samp>’ preceding the connection number indicates the

  3    core                        Local core dump file
</pre></div>

<p>To switch focus between inferiors, use the <code>inferior</code> command:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-inferior-infno"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>inferior <var>infno</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Make inferior number <var>infno</var> the current inferior.  The argument
<var>infno</var> is the inferior number assigned by <small>GDB</small>, as shown
in the first field of the ‘<samp>info inferiors</samp>’ display.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-_0024_005finferior_002c-convenience-variable"></a>
<p>The debugger convenience variable ‘<samp>$_inferior</samp>’ contains the
number of the current inferior.  You may find this useful in writing
breakpoint conditional expressions, command scripts, and so forth.
See <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Variables</a>, for general
information on convenience variables.
</p>
<p>You can get multiple executables into a debugging session via the
<code>add-inferior</code> and <code><span>clone-inferior</span></code><!-- /@w --> commands.  On some
systems <small>GDB</small> can add inferiors to the debug session
automatically by following calls to <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code>.  To
remove inferiors from the debugging session use the
<code><span>remove-inferiors</span></code><!-- /@w --> command.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="add_005finferior_005fcli"></a><a name="index-add_002dinferior"></a>

change the program assigned to the inferior at any time by using the
<code>file</code> command with the executable name as its argument.
</p>
<p>By default, the new inferior begins connected to the same target
connection as the current inferior.  For example, if the current
inferior was connected to <code>gdbserver</code> with <code>target remote</code>,
then the new inferior will be connected to the same <code>gdbserver</code>
instance.  The ‘<samp>-no-connection</samp>’ option starts the new inferior
with no connection yet.  You can then for example use the <code>target
remote</code> command to connect to some other <code>gdbserver</code> instance,
use <code>run</code> to spawn a local program, etc.
</p>
<a name="index-clone_002dinferior"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>clone-inferior [ -copies <var>n</var> ] [ <var>infno</var> ]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Adds <var>n</var> inferiors ready to execute the same program as inferior

<var>args</var>, <var><span>inferior-tty</span></var><!-- /@w --> and <var>cwd</var> properties from the
current inferior to the new one.  It also propagates changes the user
made to environment variables using the <code>set environment</code><!-- /@w --> and
<code>unset environment</code><!-- /@w --> commands.  This is a convenient command
when you want to run another instance of the inferior you are debugging.
</p>
<div>

<p>You can now simply switch focus to inferior 2 and run it.
</p>
<a name="index-remove_002dinferiors"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>remove-inferiors <var>infno</var>…</code></dt>
<dd><p>Removes the inferior or inferiors <var>infno</var>….  It is not
possible to remove an inferior that is running with this command.  For
those, use the <code>kill</code> or <code>detach</code> command first.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>To quit debugging one of the running inferiors that is not the current
inferior, you can either detach from it by using the <code>detach inferior</code><!-- /@w --> command (allowing it to run independently), or kill it
using the <code>kill inferiors</code><!-- /@w --> command:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-detach-inferiors-infno_2026"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>detach inferior <var>infno</var>…</code></dt>
<dd><p>Detach from the inferior or inferiors identified by <small>GDB</small>

stays on the list of inferiors shown by <code>info inferiors</code>, but its
Description will show ‘<samp>&lt;null&gt;</samp>’.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>After the successful completion of a command such as <code>detach</code>,
<code>detach inferiors</code>, <code>kill</code> or <code>kill inferiors</code>, or after
a normal process exit, the inferior is still valid and listed with
<code>info inferiors</code>, ready to be restarted.
</p>

<p>To be notified when inferiors are started or exit under <small>GDB</small>’s
control use <code>set print <span>inferior-events</span></code><!-- /@w -->:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-print-inferior_002devents"></a>
<a name="index-print-messages-on-inferior-start-and-exit"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set print inferior-events</code></dt>
<dt><code>set print inferior-events on</code></dt>
<dt><code>set print inferior-events off</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>set print inferior-events</code> command allows you to enable or
disable printing of messages when <small>GDB</small> notices that new
inferiors have started or that inferiors have exited or have been
detached.  By default, these messages will be printed.
</p>
<a name="index-show-print-inferior_002devents"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>show print inferior-events</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show whether messages will be printed when <small>GDB</small> detects that

</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Many commands will work the same with multiple programs as with a
single program: e.g., <code>print myglobal</code> will simply display the
value of <code>myglobal</code> in the current inferior.
</p>

<p>Occasionally, when debugging <small>GDB</small> itself, it may be useful to
get more info about the relationship of inferiors, programs, address
spaces in a debug session.  You can do that with the <code>maint info <span>program-spaces</span></code><!-- /@w --> command.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-maint-info-program_002dspaces"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>maint info program-spaces</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print a list of all program spaces currently being managed by

<p><small>GDB</small> displays for each program space (in this order):
</p>
<ol>
<li> the program space number assigned by <small>GDB</small>

</li><li> the name of the executable loaded into the program space, with e.g.,
the <code>file</code> command.

</li></ol>

<p>An asterisk ‘<samp>*</samp>’ preceding the <small>GDB</small> program space number
indicates the current program space.
</p>
<p>In addition, below each program space line, <small>GDB</small> prints extra
information that isn’t suitable to display in tabular form.  For
example, the list of inferiors bound to the program space.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) maint info program-spaces
  Id   Executable
* 1    hello
  2    goodbye
        Bound inferiors: ID 1 (process 21561)
</pre></div>

<p>Here we can see that no inferior is running the program <code>hello</code>,
while <code>process 21561</code> is running the program <code>goodbye</code>.  On
some targets, it is possible that multiple inferiors are bound to the
same program space.  The most common example is that of debugging both
the parent and child processes of a <code>vfork</code> call.  For example,
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) maint info program-spaces
  Id   Executable
* 1    vfork-test
        Bound inferiors: ID 2 (process 18050), ID 1 (process 18045)
</pre></div>

<p>Here, both inferior 2 and inferior 1 are running in the same program
space as a result of inferior 1 having executed a <code>vfork</code> call.

<h3>4.10 Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads</h3>

<a name="index-threads-of-execution"></a>
<a name="index-multiple-threads"></a>
<a name="index-switching-threads"></a>
<p>In some operating systems, such as GNU/Linux and Solaris, a single program
may have more than one <em>thread</em> of execution.  The precise semantics
of threads differ from one operating system to another, but in general
the threads of a single program are akin to multiple processes—except
that they share one address space (that is, they can all examine and
modify the same variables).  On the other hand, each thread has its own
registers and execution stack, and perhaps private memory.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> provides these facilities for debugging multi-thread
programs:
</p>
<ul>
<li> automatic notification of new threads
</li><li> ‘<samp>thread <var>thread-id</var></samp>’, a command to switch among threads
</li><li> ‘<samp>info threads</samp>’, a command to inquire about existing threads
</li><li> ‘<samp>thread apply [<var>thread-id-list</var> | all] <var>args</var></samp>’,
a command to apply a command to a list of threads
</li><li> thread-specific breakpoints
</li><li> ‘<samp>set print thread-events</samp>’, which controls printing of 
messages on thread start and exit.
</li><li> ‘<samp>set libthread-db-search-path <var>path</var></samp>’, which lets
the user specify which <code>libthread_db</code> to use if the default choice
isn’t compatible with the program.
</li></ul>

<a name="index-focus-of-debugging"></a>
<a name="index-current-thread"></a>
<p>The <small>GDB</small> thread debugging facility allows you to observe all
threads while your program runs—but whenever <small>GDB</small> takes
control, one thread in particular is always the focus of debugging.
This thread is called the <em>current thread</em>.  Debugging commands show
program information from the perspective of the current thread.
</p>
<a name="index-New-systag-message"></a>
<a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028system_0029"></a>
<p>Whenever <small>GDB</small> detects a new thread in your program, it displays
the target system’s identification for the thread with a message in the
form ‘<samp>[New <var>systag</var>]</samp>’, where <var>systag</var> is a thread identifier
whose form varies depending on the particular system.  For example, on
<small>GNU</small>/Linux, you might see
</p>
<div>
<pre>[New Thread 0x41e02940 (LWP 25582)]
</pre></div>

<p>when <small>GDB</small> notices a new thread.  In contrast, on other systems,
the <var>systag</var> is simply something like ‘<samp>process 368</samp>’, with no
further qualifier.
</p>

<a name="thread-numbers"></a><a name="index-thread-number_002c-per-inferior"></a>
<a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028GDB_0029"></a>
<p>For debugging purposes, <small>GDB</small> associates its own thread number
—always a single integer—with each thread of an inferior.  This
number is unique between all threads of an inferior, but not unique
between threads of different inferiors.
</p>
<a name="index-qualified-thread-ID"></a>
<p>You can refer to a given thread in an inferior using the qualified
<var>inferior-num</var>.<var>thread-num</var> syntax, also known as
<em>qualified thread ID</em>, with <var>inferior-num</var> being the inferior
number and <var>thread-num</var> being the thread number of the given
inferior.  For example, thread <code>2.3</code> refers to thread number 3 of
inferior 2.  If you omit <var>inferior-num</var> (e.g., <code>thread 3</code>),
then <small>GDB</small> infers you’re referring to a thread of the current
inferior.
</p>
<p>Until you create a second inferior, <small>GDB</small> does not show the
<var>inferior-num</var> part of thread IDs, even though you can always use
the full <var>inferior-num</var>.<var>thread-num</var> form to refer to threads
of inferior 1, the initial inferior.
</p>
<a name="thread-ID-lists"></a><a name="index-thread-ID-lists"></a>
<p>Some commands accept a space-separated <em>thread ID list</em> as
argument.  A list element can be:
</p>
<ol>
<li> A thread ID as shown in the first field of the ‘<samp>info threads</samp>’
display, with or without an inferior qualifier.  E.g., ‘<samp>2.1</samp>’ or
‘<samp>1</samp>’.

</li><li> A range of thread numbers, again with or without an inferior
qualifier, as in <var>inf</var>.<var>thr1</var>-<var>thr2</var> or
<var>thr1</var>-<var>thr2</var>.  E.g., ‘<samp>1.2-4</samp>’ or ‘<samp>2-4</samp>’.

</li><li> All threads of an inferior, specified with a star wildcard, with or
without an inferior qualifier, as in <var>inf</var>.<code>*</code> (e.g.,
‘<samp>1.*</samp>’) or <code>*</code>.  The former refers to all threads of the
given inferior, and the latter form without an inferior qualifier
refers to all threads of the current inferior.

</li></ol>

<p>For example, if the current inferior is 1, and inferior 7 has one
thread with ID 7.1, the thread list ‘<samp>1 2-3 4.5 6.7-9 7.*</samp>’
includes threads 1 to 3 of inferior 1, thread 5 of inferior 4, threads
7 to 9 of inferior 6 and all threads of inferior 7.  That is, in
expanded qualified form, the same as ‘<samp>1.1 1.2 1.3 4.5 6.7 6.8 6.9
7.1</samp>’.
</p>

<a name="global-thread-numbers"></a><a name="index-global-thread-number"></a>
<a name="index-global-thread-identifier-_0028GDB_0029"></a>
<p>In addition to a <em>per-inferior</em> number, each thread is also
assigned a unique <em>global</em> number, also known as <em>global
thread ID</em>, a single integer.  Unlike the thread number component of
the thread ID, no two threads have the same global ID, even when
you’re debugging multiple inferiors.
</p>
<p>From <small>GDB</small>’s perspective, a process always has at least one
thread.  In other words, <small>GDB</small> assigns a thread number to the
program’s “main thread” even if the program is not multi-threaded.
</p>
<a name="index-_0024_005fthread_002c-convenience-variable"></a>
<a name="index-_0024_005fgthread_002c-convenience-variable"></a>
<p>The debugger convenience variables ‘<samp>$_thread</samp>’ and
‘<samp>$_gthread</samp>’ contain, respectively, the per-inferior thread number
and the global thread number of the current thread.  You may find this
useful in writing breakpoint conditional expressions, command scripts,
and so forth.  See <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Variables</a>, for
general information on convenience variables.
</p>
<p>If <small>GDB</small> detects the program is multi-threaded, it augments the
usual message about stopping at a breakpoint with the ID and name of
the thread that hit the breakpoint.
</p>
<div>
<pre>Thread 2 &#34;client&#34; hit Breakpoint 1, send_message () at client.c:68
</pre></div>

<p>Likewise when the program receives a signal:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Thread 1 &#34;main&#34; received signal SIGINT, Interrupt.
</pre></div>

<p>The <var>flag</var> arguments control what output to produce and how to handle

<h3>4.11 Debugging Forks</h3>

<a name="index-fork_002c-debugging-programs-which-call"></a>
<a name="index-multiple-processes"></a>
<a name="index-processes_002c-multiple"></a>
<p>On most systems, <small>GDB</small> has no special support for debugging
programs which create additional processes using the <code>fork</code>
function.  When a program forks, <small>GDB</small> will continue to debug the
parent process and the child process will run unimpeded.  If you have
set a breakpoint in any code which the child then executes, the child
will get a <code>SIGTRAP</code> signal which (unless it catches the signal)
will cause it to terminate.
</p>
<p>However, if you want to debug the child process there is a workaround
which isn’t too painful.  Put a call to <code>sleep</code> in the code which
the child process executes after the fork.  It may be useful to sleep
only if a certain environment variable is set, or a certain file exists,
so that the delay need not occur when you don’t want to run <small>GDB</small>
on the child.  While the child is sleeping, use the <code>ps</code> program to
get its process ID.  Then tell <small>GDB</small> (a new invocation of
<small>GDB</small> if you are also debugging the parent process) to attach to
the child process (see <a href="#Attach">Attach</a>).  From that point on you can debug
the child process just like any other process which you attached to.
</p>
<p>On some systems, <small>GDB</small> provides support for debugging programs
that create additional processes using the <code>fork</code> or <code>vfork</code>
functions.  On <small>GNU</small>/Linux platforms, this feature is supported
with kernel version 2.5.46 and later.
</p>
<p>The fork debugging commands are supported in native mode and when
connected to <code>gdbserver</code> in either <code>target remote</code> mode or
<code>target extended-remote</code> mode.
</p>
<p>By default, when a program forks, <small>GDB</small> will continue to debug
the parent process and the child process will run unimpeded.
</p>
<p>If you want to follow the child process instead of the parent process,
use the command <code>set <span>follow-fork-mode</span></code><!-- /@w -->.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-follow_002dfork_002dmode"></a>

command <code>set <span>detach-on-fork</span></code><!-- /@w -->.

<dl compact="compact">

</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>on</code></dt>
<dd><p>The child process (or parent process, depending on the value of
<code>follow-fork-mode</code>) will be detached and allowed to run 
independently.  This is the default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>off</code></dt>
<dd><p>Both processes will be held under the control of <small>GDB</small>.

</dd>
<dt><code>show detach-on-fork</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show whether detach-on-fork mode is on/off.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If you choose to set ‘<samp>detach-on-fork</samp>’ mode off, then <small>GDB</small>
will retain control of all forked processes (including nested forks).
You can list the forked processes under the control of <small>GDB</small> by
using the <code>info inferiors</code><!-- /@w --> command, and switch from one fork
to another by using the <code>inferior</code> command (see <a href="#Inferiors-Connections-and-Programs">Debugging Multiple Inferiors Connections and Programs</a>).
</p>
<p>To quit debugging one of the forked processes, you can either detach
from it by using the <code>detach inferiors</code><!-- /@w --> command (allowing it
to run independently), or kill it using the <code>kill inferiors</code><!-- /@w -->
command.  See <a href="#Inferiors-Connections-and-Programs">Debugging
Multiple Inferiors Connections and Programs</a>.
</p>
<p>If you ask to debug a child process and a <code>vfork</code> is followed by an
<code>exec</code>, <small>GDB</small> executes the new target up to the first
breakpoint in the new target.  If you have a breakpoint set on
<code>main</code> in your original program, the breakpoint will also be set on
the child process’s <code>main</code>.
</p>
<p>On some systems, when a child process is spawned by <code>vfork</code>, you
cannot debug the child or parent until an <code>exec</code> call completes.
</p>
<p>If you issue a <code>run</code> command to <small>GDB</small> after an <code>exec</code>
call executes, the new target restarts.  To restart the parent
process, use the <code>file</code> command with the parent executable name
as its argument.  By default, after an <code>exec</code> call executes,
<small>GDB</small> discards the symbols of the previous executable image.
You can change this behaviour with the <code>set <span>follow-exec-mode</span></code><!-- /@w -->
command.

<a name="index-rewind-program-state"></a>

<p>On certain operating systems<a name="DOCF4" href="#FOOT4"><sup>4</sup></a>, <small>GDB</small> is able to save a <em>snapshot</em> of a
program’s state, called a <em>checkpoint</em>, and come back to it
later.
</p>
<p>Returning to a checkpoint effectively undoes everything that has
happened in the program since the <code>checkpoint</code> was saved.  This
includes changes in memory, registers, and even (within some limits)
system state.  Effectively, it is like going back in time to the
moment when the checkpoint was saved.
</p>
<p>Thus, if you’re stepping thru a program and you think you’re 
getting close to the point where things go wrong, you can save
a checkpoint.  Then, if you accidentally go too far and miss
the critical statement, instead of having to restart your program
from the beginning, you can just go back to the checkpoint and
start again from there.
</p>
<p>This can be especially useful if it takes a lot of time or 
steps to reach the point where you think the bug occurs.  
</p>
<p>To use the <code>checkpoint</code>/<code>restart</code> method of debugging:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-checkpoint-1"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>checkpoint</code></dt>
<dd><p>Save a snapshot of the debugged program’s current execution state.
The <code>checkpoint</code> command takes no arguments, but each checkpoint

<a name="index-info-checkpoints"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>info checkpoints</code></dt>
<dd><p>List the checkpoints that have been saved in the current debugging

<dt><code>Code Address</code></dt>
<dt><code>Source line, or label</code></dt>

in time when the checkpoint was saved.
</p>
<p>Note that breakpoints, <small>GDB</small> variables, command history etc.
are not affected by restoring a checkpoint.  In general, a checkpoint
only restores things that reside in the program being debugged, not in
the debugger.

</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Returning to a previously saved checkpoint will restore the user state
of the program being debugged, plus a significant subset of the system
(OS) state, including file pointers.  It won’t “un-write” data from
a file, but it will rewind the file pointer to the previous location,
so that the previously written data can be overwritten.  For files
opened in read mode, the pointer will also be restored so that the
previously read data can be read again.
</p>
<p>Of course, characters that have been sent to a printer (or other
external device) cannot be “snatched back”, and characters received
from eg. a serial device can be removed from internal program buffers,
but they cannot be “pushed back” into the serial pipeline, ready to
be received again.  Similarly, the actual contents of files that have
been changed cannot be restored (at this time).
</p>
<p>However, within those constraints, you actually can “rewind” your
program to a previously saved point in time, and begin debugging it
again — and you can change the course of events so as to debug a
different execution path this time.
</p>
<a name="index-checkpoints-and-process-id"></a>
<p>Finally, there is one bit of internal program state that will be
different when you return to a checkpoint — the program’s process
id.  Each checkpoint will have a unique process id (or <var>pid</var>), 
and each will be different from the program’s original <var>pid</var>.
If your program has saved a local copy of its process id, this could
potentially pose a problem.
</p>
<a name="A-Non_002dobvious-Benefit-of-Using-Checkpoints"></a>
<h4>4.12.1 A Non-obvious Benefit of Using Checkpoints</h4>

<p>On some systems such as <small>GNU</small>/Linux, address space randomization
is performed on new processes for security reasons.  This makes it 
difficult or impossible to set a breakpoint, or watchpoint, on an
absolute address if you have to restart the program, since the 
absolute location of a symbol will change from one execution to the
next.
</p>
<p>A checkpoint, however, is an <em>identical</em> copy of a process. 
Therefore if you create a checkpoint at (eg.) the start of main, 
and simply return to that checkpoint instead of restarting the 
process, you can avoid the effects of address randomization and
your symbols will all stay in the same place.

<a name="Stopping"></a>

<a name="Stopping-and-Continuing"></a>
<h2>5 Stopping and Continuing</h2>

<p>The principal purposes of using a debugger are so that you can stop your
program before it terminates; or so that, if your program runs into
trouble, you can investigate and find out why.
</p>
<p>Inside <small>GDB</small>, your program may stop for any of several reasons,
such as a signal, a breakpoint, or reaching a new line after a
<small>GDB</small> command such as <code>step</code>.  You may then examine and
change variables, set new breakpoints or remove old ones, and then
continue execution.  Usually, the messages shown by <small>GDB</small> provide
ample explanation of the status of your program—but you can also
explicitly request this information at any time.

<h3>5.1 Breakpoints, Watchpoints, and Catchpoints</h3>

<a name="index-breakpoints"></a>
<p>A <em>breakpoint</em> makes your program stop whenever a certain point in
the program is reached.  For each breakpoint, you can add conditions to
control in finer detail whether your program stops.  You can set
breakpoints with the <code>break</code> command and its variants (see <a href="#Set-Breaks">Setting Breakpoints</a>), to specify the place where your program
should stop by line number, function name or exact address in the
program.
</p>
<p>On some systems, you can set breakpoints in shared libraries before
the executable is run.
</p>
<a name="index-watchpoints"></a>
<a name="index-data-breakpoints"></a>
<a name="index-memory-tracing"></a>
<a name="index-breakpoint-on-memory-address"></a>
<a name="index-breakpoint-on-variable-modification"></a>
<p>A <em>watchpoint</em> is a special breakpoint that stops your program
when the value of an expression changes.  The expression may be a value
of a variable, or it could involve values of one or more variables
combined by operators, such as ‘<samp>a + b</samp>’.  This is sometimes called
<em>data breakpoints</em>.  You must use a different command to set
watchpoints (see <a href="#Set-Watchpoints">Setting Watchpoints</a>), but aside
from that, you can manage a watchpoint like any other breakpoint: you
enable, disable, and delete both breakpoints and watchpoints using the
same commands.
</p>
<p>You can arrange to have values from your program displayed automatically
whenever <small>GDB</small> stops at a breakpoint.  See <a href="#Auto-Display">Automatic Display</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-catchpoints"></a>
<a name="index-breakpoint-on-events"></a>
<p>A <em>catchpoint</em> is another special breakpoint that stops your program
when a certain kind of event occurs, such as the throwing of a C<tt>++</tt>
exception or the loading of a library.  As with watchpoints, you use a
different command to set a catchpoint (see <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Setting
Catchpoints</a>), but aside from that, you can manage a catchpoint like any
other breakpoint.  (To stop when your program receives a signal, use the
<code>handle</code> command; see <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>.)
</p>
<a name="index-breakpoint-numbers"></a>
<a name="index-numbers-for-breakpoints"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> assigns a number to each breakpoint, watchpoint, or
catchpoint when you create it; these numbers are successive integers
starting with one.  In many of the commands for controlling various
features of breakpoints you use the breakpoint number to say which
breakpoint you want to change.  Each breakpoint may be <em>enabled</em> or
<em>disabled</em>; if disabled, it has no effect on your program until you
enable it again.
</p>
<a name="index-breakpoint-ranges"></a>
<a name="index-breakpoint-lists"></a>
<a name="index-ranges-of-breakpoints"></a>
<a name="index-lists-of-breakpoints"></a>
<p>Some <small>GDB</small> commands accept a space-separated list of breakpoints
on which to operate.  A list element can be either a single breakpoint number,
like ‘<samp>5</samp>’, or a range of such numbers, like ‘<samp>5-7</samp>’.
When a breakpoint list is given to a command, all breakpoints in that list
are operated on.

<a name="Setting-Breakpoints"></a>
<h4>5.1.1 Setting Breakpoints</h4>


<a name="index-break"></a>
<a name="index-b-_0028break_0029"></a>
<a name="index-_0024bpnum_002c-convenience-variable"></a>
<a name="index-latest-breakpoint"></a>
<p>Breakpoints are set with the <code>break</code> command (abbreviated
<code>b</code>).  The debugger convenience variable ‘<samp>$bpnum</samp>’ records the
number of the breakpoint you’ve set most recently; see <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Variables</a>, for a discussion of what you can do with
convenience variables.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>break <var>location</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set a breakpoint at the given <var>location</var>, which can specify a
function name, a line number, or an address of an instruction.
(See <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>, for a list of all the possible ways to
specify a <var>location</var>.)  The breakpoint will stop your program just
before it executes any of the code in the specified <var>location</var>.
</p>
<p>When using source languages that permit overloading of symbols, such as
C<tt>++</tt>, a function name may refer to more than one possible place to break.
See <a href="#Ambiguous-Expressions">Ambiguous Expressions</a>, for a discussion of
that situation.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to insert a breakpoint that will stop the program
only if a specific thread (see <a href="#Thread_002dSpecific-Breakpoints">Thread-Specific Breakpoints</a>)
or a specific task (see <a href="#Ada-Tasks">Ada Tasks</a>) hits that breakpoint.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>break</code></dt>
<dd><p>When called without any arguments, <code>break</code> sets a breakpoint at
the next instruction to be executed in the selected stack frame
(see <a href="#Stack">Examining the Stack</a>).  In any selected frame but the
innermost, this makes your program stop as soon as control
returns to that frame.  This is similar to the effect of a
<code>finish</code> command in the frame inside the selected frame—except
that <code>finish</code> does not leave an active breakpoint.  If you use
<code>break</code> without an argument in the innermost frame, <small>GDB</small> stops
the next time it reaches the current location; this may be useful
inside loops.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> normally ignores breakpoints when it resumes execution, until at
least one instruction has been executed.  If it did not do this, you
would be unable to proceed past a breakpoint without first disabling the
breakpoint.  This rule applies whether or not the breakpoint already
existed when your program stopped.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>break … if <var>cond</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set a breakpoint with condition <var>cond</var>; evaluate the expression
<var>cond</var> each time the breakpoint is reached, and stop only if the
value is nonzero—that is, if <var>cond</var> evaluates as true.
‘<samp>…</samp>’ stands for one of the possible arguments described
above (or no argument) specifying where to break.  See <a href="#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>, for more information on breakpoint conditions.
</p>
<p>The breakpoint may be mapped to multiple locations.  If the breakpoint
condition <var>cond</var> is invalid at some but not all of the locations,
the locations for which the condition is invalid are disabled.  For
example, <small>GDB</small> reports below that two of the three locations
are disabled.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) break func if a == 10
warning: failed to validate condition at location 0x11ce, disabling:
  No symbol &#34;a&#34; in current context.
warning: failed to validate condition at location 0x11b6, disabling:
  No symbol &#34;a&#34; in current context.
Breakpoint 1 at 0x11b6: func. (3 locations)
</pre></div>

<p>Locations that are disabled because of the condition are denoted by an
uppercase <code>N</code> in the output of the <code>info breakpoints</code>
command:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) info breakpoints
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep y   &lt;MULTIPLE&gt;
        stop only if a == 10
1.1                         N*  0x00000000000011b6 in ...
1.2                         y   0x00000000000011c2 in ...
1.3                         N*  0x00000000000011ce in ...
(*): Breakpoint condition is invalid at this location.
</pre></div>

<p>If the breakpoint condition <var>cond</var> is invalid in the context of
<em>all</em> the locations of the breakpoint, <small>GDB</small> refuses to
define the breakpoint.  For example, if variable <code>foo</code> is an
undefined variable:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) break func if foo
No symbol &#34;foo&#34; in current context.
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>break … -force-condition if <var>cond</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>There may be cases where the condition <var>cond</var> is invalid at all
the current locations, but the user knows that it will be valid at a
future location; for example, because of a library load.  In such
cases, by using the <code>-force-condition</code> keyword before ‘<samp>if</samp>’,
<small>GDB</small> can be forced to define the breakpoint with the given
condition expression instead of refusing it.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) break func -force-condition if foo
warning: failed to validate condition at location 1, disabling:
  No symbol &#34;foo&#34; in current context.
warning: failed to validate condition at location 2, disabling:
  No symbol &#34;foo&#34; in current context.
warning: failed to validate condition at location 3, disabling:
  No symbol &#34;foo&#34; in current context.
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1158: test.c:18. (3 locations)
</pre></div>

<p>This causes all the present locations where the breakpoint would
otherwise be inserted, to be disabled, as seen in the example above.
However, if there exist locations at which the condition is valid, the
<code>-force-condition</code> keyword has no effect.

debugging, so you can set a breakpoint at an instruction without
changing the instruction.  This can be used with the new trap-generation
provided by SPARClite DSU and most x86-based targets.  These targets
will generate traps when a program accesses some data or instruction
address that is assigned to the debug registers.  However the hardware
breakpoint registers can take a limited number of breakpoints.  For
example, on the DSU, only two data breakpoints can be set at a time, and
<small>GDB</small> will reject this command if more than two are used.  Delete
or disable unused hardware breakpoints before setting new ones
(see <a href="#Disabling">Disabling Breakpoints</a>).
See <a href="#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>.

<dt><code>rbreak <var>regex</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set breakpoints on all functions matching the regular expression
<var>regex</var>.  This command sets an unconditional breakpoint on all

breakpoints are set, they are treated just like the breakpoints set with
the <code>break</code> command.  You can delete them, disable them, or make
them conditional the same way as any other breakpoint.
</p>
<p>In programs using different languages, <small>GDB</small> chooses the syntax
to print the list of all breakpoints it sets according to the
‘<samp>set language</samp>’ value: using ‘<samp>set language auto</samp>’
(see <a href="#Automatically">Set Language Automatically</a>) means to use the
language of the breakpoint’s function, other values mean to use
the manually specified language (see <a href="#Manually">Set Language Manually</a>).
</p>
<p>The syntax of the regular expression is the standard one used with tools
like <samp>grep</samp>.  Note that this is different from the syntax used by
shells, so for instance <code>foo*</code> matches all functions that include
an <code>fo</code> followed by zero or more <code>o</code>s.  There is an implicit
<code>.*</code> leading and trailing the regular expression you supply, so to
match only functions that begin with <code>foo</code>, use <code>^foo</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-non_002dmember-C_002b_002b-functions_002c-set-breakpoint-in"></a>
<p>When debugging C<tt>++</tt> programs, <code>rbreak</code> is useful for setting
breakpoints on overloaded functions that are not members of any special
classes.
</p>
<a name="index-set-breakpoints-on-all-functions"></a>
<p>The <code>rbreak</code> command can be used to set breakpoints in
<strong>all</strong> the functions in a program, like this:
</p>


</dd>
<dt><code>rbreak <var>file</var>:<var>regex</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>If <code>rbreak</code> is called with a filename qualification, it limits
the search for functions matching the given regular expression to the
specified <var>file</var>.  This can be used, for example, to set breakpoints on
every function in a given file:
</p>


<p>The colon separating the filename qualifier from the regex may

For each breakpoint, following columns are printed:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<dd><p>Breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint.
</p></dd>
<dt><em>Disposition</em></dt>
<dd><p>Whether the breakpoint is marked to be disabled or deleted when hit.
</p></dd>
<dt><em>Enabled or Disabled</em></dt>
<dd><p>Enabled breakpoints are marked with ‘<samp>y</samp>’.  ‘<samp>n</samp>’ marks breakpoints
that are not enabled.
</p></dd>
<dt><em>Address</em></dt>
<dd><p>Where the breakpoint is in your program, as a memory address.  For a
pending breakpoint whose address is not yet known, this field will
contain ‘<samp>&lt;PENDING&gt;</samp>’.  Such breakpoint won’t fire until a shared
library that has the symbol or line referred by breakpoint is loaded.
See below for details.  A breakpoint with several locations will
have ‘<samp>&lt;MULTIPLE&gt;</samp>’ in this field—see below for details.
</p></dd>
<dt><em>What</em></dt>
<dd><p>Where the breakpoint is in the source for your program, as a file and
line number.  For a pending breakpoint, the original string passed to
the breakpoint command will be listed as it cannot be resolved until
the appropriate shared library is loaded in the future.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If a breakpoint is conditional, there are two evaluation modes: “host” and
“target”.  If mode is “host”, breakpoint condition evaluation is done by
<small>GDB</small> on the host’s side.  If it is “target”, then the condition
is evaluated by the target.  The <code>info break</code> command shows
the condition on the line following the affected breakpoint, together with
its condition evaluation mode in between parentheses.
</p>
<p>Breakpoint commands, if any, are listed after that.  A pending breakpoint is
allowed to have a condition specified for it.  The condition is not parsed for
validity until a shared library is loaded that allows the pending
breakpoint to resolve to a valid location.
</p>
<p><code>info break</code> with a breakpoint
number <var>n</var> as argument lists only that breakpoint.  The
convenience variable <code>$_</code> and the default examining-address for
the <code>x</code> command are set to the address of the last breakpoint
listed (see <a href="#Memory">Examining Memory</a>).
</p>
<p><code>info break</code> displays a count of the number of times the breakpoint
has been hit.  This is especially useful in conjunction with the
<code>ignore</code> command.  You can ignore a large number of breakpoint
hits, look at the breakpoint info to see how many times the breakpoint
was hit, and then run again, ignoring one less than that number.  This
will get you quickly to the last hit of that breakpoint.
</p>
<p>For a breakpoints with an enable count (xref) greater than 1,
<code>info break</code> also displays that count.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p><small>GDB</small> allows you to set any number of breakpoints at the same place in
your program.  There is nothing silly or meaningless about this.  When
the breakpoints are conditional, this is even useful
(see <a href="#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>).
</p>
<a name="index-multiple-locations_002c-breakpoints"></a>
<a name="index-breakpoints_002c-multiple-locations"></a>
<p>It is possible that a breakpoint corresponds to several locations
in your program.  Examples of this situation are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Multiple functions in the program may have the same name.

</li><li> For a C<tt>++</tt> constructor, the <small>GCC</small> compiler generates several
instances of the function body, used in different cases.

</li><li> For a C<tt>++</tt> template function, a given line in the function can
correspond to any number of instantiations.

</li><li> For an inlined function, a given source line can correspond to
several places where that function is inlined.
</li></ul>

<p>In all those cases, <small>GDB</small> will insert a breakpoint at all
the relevant locations.
</p>
<p>A breakpoint with multiple locations is displayed in the breakpoint
table using several rows—one header row, followed by one row for
each breakpoint location.  The header row has ‘<samp>&lt;MULTIPLE&gt;</samp>’ in the
address column.  The rows for individual locations contain the actual
addresses for locations, and show the functions to which those
locations belong.  The number column for a location is of the form
<var>breakpoint-number</var>.<var>location-number</var>.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Num     Type           Disp Enb  Address    What
1       breakpoint     keep y    &lt;MULTIPLE&gt;
        stop only if i==1
        breakpoint already hit 1 time
1.1                         y    0x080486a2 in void foo&lt;int&gt;() at t.cc:8
1.2                         y    0x080486ca in void foo&lt;double&gt;() at t.cc:8
</pre></div>

<p>You cannot delete the individual locations from a breakpoint.  However,
each location can be individually enabled or disabled by passing
<var>breakpoint-number</var>.<var>location-number</var> as argument to the
<code>enable</code> and <code>disable</code> commands.  It’s also possible to
<code>enable</code> and <code>disable</code> a range of <var>location-number</var>
locations using a <var>breakpoint-number</var> and two <var>location-number</var>s,
in increasing order, separated by a hyphen, like
<kbd><var>breakpoint-number</var>.<var>location-number1</var>-<var>location-number2</var></kbd>,
in which case <small>GDB</small> acts on all the locations in the range (inclusive).
Disabling or enabling the parent breakpoint (see <a href="#Disabling">Disabling</a>) affects
all of the locations that belong to that breakpoint.
</p>
<a name="index-pending-breakpoints"></a>
<p>It’s quite common to have a breakpoint inside a shared library.
Shared libraries can be loaded and unloaded explicitly,
and possibly repeatedly, as the program is executed.  To support
this use case, <small>GDB</small> updates breakpoint locations whenever
any shared library is loaded or unloaded.  Typically, you would
set a breakpoint in a shared library at the beginning of your
debugging session, when the library is not loaded, and when the
symbols from the library are not available.  When you try to set
breakpoint, <small>GDB</small> will ask you if you want to set
a so called <em>pending breakpoint</em>—breakpoint whose address
is not yet resolved.
</p>
<p>After the program is run, whenever a new shared library is loaded,
<small>GDB</small> reevaluates all the breakpoints.  When a newly loaded
shared library contains the symbol or line referred to by some
pending breakpoint, that breakpoint is resolved and becomes an
ordinary breakpoint.  When a library is unloaded, all breakpoints
that refer to its symbols or source lines become pending again.
</p>
<p>This logic works for breakpoints with multiple locations, too.  For
example, if you have a breakpoint in a C<tt>++</tt> template function, and
a newly loaded shared library has an instantiation of that template,
a new location is added to the list of locations for the breakpoint.
</p>
<p>Except for having unresolved address, pending breakpoints do not
differ from regular breakpoints.  You can set conditions or commands,
enable and disable them and perform other breakpoint operations.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> provides some additional commands for controlling what
happens when the ‘<samp>break</samp>’ command cannot resolve breakpoint
address specification to an address:
</p>
<a name="index-set-breakpoint-pending"></a>
<a name="index-show-breakpoint-pending"></a>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set breakpoint pending auto</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is the default behavior.  When <small>GDB</small> cannot find the breakpoint
location, it queries you whether a pending breakpoint should be created.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set breakpoint pending on</code></dt>
<dd><p>This indicates that an unrecognized breakpoint location should automatically
result in a pending breakpoint being created.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set breakpoint pending off</code></dt>
<dd><p>This indicates that pending breakpoints are not to be created.  Any
unrecognized breakpoint location results in an error.  This setting does
not affect any pending breakpoints previously created.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show breakpoint pending</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show the current behavior setting for creating pending breakpoints.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The settings above only affect the <code>break</code> command and its
variants.  Once breakpoint is set, it will be automatically updated
as shared libraries are loaded and unloaded.
</p>
<a name="index-automatic-hardware-breakpoints"></a>
<p>For some targets, <small>GDB</small> can automatically decide if hardware or
software breakpoints should be used, depending on whether the
breakpoint address is read-only or read-write.  This applies to
breakpoints set with the <code>break</code> command as well as to internal
breakpoints set by commands like <code>next</code> and <code>finish</code>.  For
breakpoints set with <code>hbreak</code>, <small>GDB</small> will always use hardware
breakpoints.
</p>
<p>You can control this automatic behaviour with the following commands:

<p><small>GDB</small> itself sometimes sets breakpoints in your program for

<a name="Setting-Watchpoints"></a>
<h4>5.1.2 Setting Watchpoints</h4>

<a name="index-setting-watchpoints"></a>
<p>You can use a watchpoint to stop execution whenever the value of an
expression changes, without having to predict a particular place where
this may happen.  (This is sometimes called a <em>data breakpoint</em>.)
The expression may be as simple as the value of a single variable, or
as complex as many variables combined by operators.  Examples include:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A reference to the value of a single variable.

</li><li> An address cast to an appropriate data type.  For example,
‘<samp>*(int *)0x12345678</samp>’ will watch a 4-byte region at the specified
address (assuming an <code>int</code> occupies 4 bytes).

</li><li> An arbitrarily complex expression, such as ‘<samp>a*b + c/d</samp>’.  The
expression can use any operators valid in the program’s native
language (see <a href="#Languages">Languages</a>).
</li></ul>

<p>You can set a watchpoint on an expression even if the expression can
not be evaluated yet.  For instance, you can set a watchpoint on
‘<samp>*global_ptr</samp>’ before ‘<samp>global_ptr</samp>’ is initialized.
<small>GDB</small> will stop when your program sets ‘<samp>global_ptr</samp>’ and
the expression produces a valid value.  If the expression becomes
valid in some other way than changing a variable (e.g. if the memory
pointed to by ‘<samp>*global_ptr</samp>’ becomes readable as the result of a
<code>malloc</code> call), <small>GDB</small> may not stop until the next time
the expression changes.
</p>
<a name="index-software-watchpoints"></a>
<a name="index-hardware-watchpoints"></a>
<p>Depending on your system, watchpoints may be implemented in software or
hardware.  <small>GDB</small> does software watchpointing by single-stepping your
program and testing the variable’s value each time, which is hundreds of
times slower than normal execution.  (But this may still be worth it, to
catch errors where you have no clue what part of your program is the
culprit.)
</p>
<p>On some systems, such as most PowerPC or x86-based targets,
<small>GDB</small> includes support for hardware watchpoints, which do not
slow down the running of your program.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-watch"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>watch <span>[</span>-l<span>|</span>-location<span>]</span> <var>expr</var> <span>[</span>thread <var>thread-id</var><span>]</span> <span>[</span>mask <var>maskvalue</var><span>]</span> <span>[</span>task <var>task-id</var><span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set a watchpoint for an expression.  <small>GDB</small> will break when the
expression <var>expr</var> is written into by the program and its value
changes.  The simplest (and the most popular) use of this command is
to watch the value of a single variable:
</p>


<p>If the command includes a <code><span>[</span>thread <var>thread-id</var><span>]</span></code>
argument, <small>GDB</small> breaks only when the thread identified by
<var>thread-id</var> changes the value of <var>expr</var>.  If any other threads
change the value of <var>expr</var>, <small>GDB</small> will not break.  Note
that watchpoints restricted to a single thread in this way only work
with Hardware Watchpoints.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if the <code>task</code> argument is given, then the watchpoint
will be specific to the indicated Ada task (see <a href="#Ada-Tasks">Ada Tasks</a>).
</p>
<p>Ordinarily a watchpoint respects the scope of variables in <var>expr</var>
(see below).  The <code>-location</code> argument tells <small>GDB</small> to
instead watch the memory referred to by <var>expr</var>.  In this case,
<small>GDB</small> will evaluate <var>expr</var>, take the address of the result,
and watch the memory at that address.  The type of the result is used
to determine the size of the watched memory.  If the expression’s
result does not have an address, then <small>GDB</small> will print an
error.
</p>
<p>The <code><span>[</span>mask <var>maskvalue</var><span>]</span></code> argument allows creation
of masked watchpoints, if the current architecture supports this
feature (e.g., PowerPC Embedded architecture, see <a href="#PowerPC-Embedded">PowerPC Embedded</a>.)  A <em>masked watchpoint</em> specifies a mask in addition
to an address to watch.  The mask specifies that some bits of an address
(the bits which are reset in the mask) should be ignored when matching
the address accessed by the inferior against the watchpoint address.
Thus, a masked watchpoint watches many addresses simultaneously—those
addresses whose unmasked bits are identical to the unmasked bits in the
watchpoint address.  The <code>mask</code> argument implies <code>-location</code>.
Examples:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) watch foo mask 0xffff00ff
(gdb) watch *0xdeadbeef mask 0xffffff00
</pre></div>

<a name="index-rwatch"></a>

<dd><p>Set a watchpoint that will break when the value of <var>expr</var> is read

<dd><p>Set a watchpoint that will break when <var>expr</var> is either read from
or written into by the program.
</p>
<a name="index-info-watchpoints-_005blist_2026_005d"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>info watchpoints <span>[</span><var>list</var>…<span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>This command prints a list of watchpoints, using the same format as
<code>info break</code> (see <a href="#Set-Breaks">Set Breaks</a>).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If you watch for a change in a numerically entered address you need to
dereference it, as the address itself is just a constant number which will
never change.  <small>GDB</small> refuses to create a watchpoint that watches
a never-changing value:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) watch 0x600850
Cannot watch constant value 0x600850.
(gdb) watch *(int *) 0x600850
Watchpoint 1: *(int *) 6293584
</pre></div>

<p><small>GDB</small> sets a <em>hardware watchpoint</em> if possible.  Hardware
watchpoints execute very quickly, and the debugger reports a change in
value at the exact instruction where the change occurs.  If <small>GDB</small>
cannot set a hardware watchpoint, it sets a software watchpoint, which
executes more slowly and reports the change in value at the next
<em>statement</em>, not the instruction, after the change occurs.
</p>
<a name="index-use-only-software-watchpoints"></a>
<p>You can force <small>GDB</small> to use only software watchpoints with the
<kbd>set can-use-hw-watchpoints 0</kbd> command.  With this variable set to
zero, <small>GDB</small> will never try to use hardware watchpoints, even if
the underlying system supports them.  (Note that hardware-assisted
watchpoints that were set <em>before</em> setting
<code>can-use-hw-watchpoints</code> to zero will still use the hardware
mechanism of watching expression values.)
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set can-use-hw-watchpoints</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-can_002duse_002dhw_002dwatchpoints"></a>

</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>For remote targets, you can restrict the number of hardware
watchpoints <small>GDB</small> will use, see <a href="#set-remote-hardware_002dbreakpoint_002dlimit">set remote hardware-breakpoint-limit</a>.
</p>
<p>When you issue the <code>watch</code> command, <small>GDB</small> reports
</p>
<div>
<pre>Hardware watchpoint <var>num</var>: <var>expr</var>
</pre></div>

<p>if it was able to set a hardware watchpoint.
</p>
<p>Currently, the <code>awatch</code> and <code>rwatch</code> commands can only set
hardware watchpoints, because accesses to data that don’t change the
value of the watched expression cannot be detected without examining
every instruction as it is being executed, and <small>GDB</small> does not do
that currently.  If <small>GDB</small> finds that it is unable to set a
hardware breakpoint with the <code>awatch</code> or <code>rwatch</code> command, it
will print a message like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Expression cannot be implemented with read/access watchpoint.
</pre></div>

<p>Sometimes, <small>GDB</small> cannot set a hardware watchpoint because the
data type of the watched expression is wider than what a hardware
watchpoint on the target machine can handle.  For example, some systems
can only watch regions that are up to 4 bytes wide; on such systems you
cannot set hardware watchpoints for an expression that yields a
double-precision floating-point number (which is typically 8 bytes
wide).  As a work-around, it might be possible to break the large region
into a series of smaller ones and watch them with separate watchpoints.
</p>
<p>If you set too many hardware watchpoints, <small>GDB</small> might be unable
to insert all of them when you resume the execution of your program.
Since the precise number of active watchpoints is unknown until such
time as the program is about to be resumed, <small>GDB</small> might not be
able to warn you about this when you set the watchpoints, and the
warning will be printed only when the program is resumed:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Hardware watchpoint <var>num</var>: Could not insert watchpoint
</pre></div>

<p>If this happens, delete or disable some of the watchpoints.
</p>
<p>Watching complex expressions that reference many variables can also
exhaust the resources available for hardware-assisted watchpoints.
That’s because <small>GDB</small> needs to watch every variable in the
expression with separately allocated resources.
</p>
<p>If you call a function interactively using <code>print</code> or <code>call</code>,
any watchpoints you have set will be inactive until <small>GDB</small> reaches another
kind of breakpoint or the call completes.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> automatically deletes watchpoints that watch local
(automatic) variables, or expressions that involve such variables, when
they go out of scope, that is, when the execution leaves the block in
which these variables were defined.  In particular, when the program
being debugged terminates, <em>all</em> local variables go out of scope,
and so only watchpoints that watch global variables remain set.  If you
rerun the program, you will need to set all such watchpoints again.  One
way of doing that would be to set a code breakpoint at the entry to the
<code>main</code> function and when it breaks, set all the watchpoints.
</p>
<a name="index-watchpoints-and-threads"></a>
<a name="index-threads-and-watchpoints"></a>
<p>In multi-threaded programs, watchpoints will detect changes to the
watched expression from every thread.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Warning:</em> In multi-threaded programs, software watchpoints
have only limited usefulness.  If <small>GDB</small> creates a software
watchpoint, it can only watch the value of an expression <em>in a
single thread</em>.  If you are confident that the expression can only
change due to the current thread’s activity (and if you are also
confident that no other thread can become current), then you can use
software watchpoints as usual.  However, <small>GDB</small> may not notice
when a non-current thread’s activity changes the expression.  (Hardware
watchpoints, in contrast, watch an expression in all threads.)

</p>
<a name="index-_0024_005fexception_002c-convenience-variable"></a>
<p>The convenience variable <code>$_exception</code> is available at an
exception-related catchpoint, on some systems.  This holds the
exception being thrown.
</p>
<p>There are currently some limitations to C<tt>++</tt> exception handling in
<small>GDB</small>:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The support for these commands is system-dependent.  Currently, only
systems using the ‘<samp>gnu-v3</samp>’ C<tt>++</tt> ABI (see <a href="#ABI">ABI</a>) are
supported.

</li><li> The regular expression feature and the <code>$_exception</code> convenience
variable rely on the presence of some SDT probes in <code>libstdc++</code>.
If these probes are not present, then these features cannot be used.
These probes were first available in the GCC 4.8 release, but whether
or not they are available in your GCC also depends on how it was
built.

</li><li> The <code>$_exception</code> convenience variable is only valid at the
instruction at which an exception-related catchpoint is set.

</li><li> When an exception-related catchpoint is hit, <small>GDB</small> stops at a
location in the system library which implements runtime exception
support for C<tt>++</tt>, usually <code>libstdc++</code>.  You can use <code>up</code>
(see <a href="#Selection">Selection</a>) to get to your code.

</li><li> If you call a function interactively, <small>GDB</small> normally returns
control to you when the function has finished executing.  If the call
raises an exception, however, the call may bypass the mechanism that
returns control to you and cause your program either to abort or to
simply continue running until it hits a breakpoint, catches a signal
that <small>GDB</small> is listening for, or exits.  This is the case even if
you set a catchpoint for the exception; catchpoints on exceptions are
disabled within interactive calls.  See <a href="#Calling">Calling</a>, for information on
controlling this with <code>set unwind-on-terminating-exception</code>.

</li><li> You cannot raise an exception interactively.

<p>A call to or return from a system call, a.k.a. <em>syscall</em>.  A
syscall is a mechanism for application programs to request a service
from the operating system (OS) or one of the OS system services.
<small>GDB</small> can catch some or all of the syscalls issued by the
debuggee, and show the related information for each syscall.  If no
argument is specified, calls to and returns from all system calls
will be caught.
</p>
<p><var>name</var> can be any system call name that is valid for the
underlying OS.  Just what syscalls are valid depends on the OS.  On
GNU and Unix systems, you can find the full list of valid syscall
names on <samp>/usr/include/asm/unistd.h</samp>.
</p>

<p>Normally, <small>GDB</small> knows in advance which syscalls are valid for
each OS, so you can use the <small>GDB</small> command-line completion
facilities (see <a href="#Completion">command completion</a>) to list the
available choices.
</p>
<p>You may also specify the system call numerically.  A syscall’s
number is the value passed to the OS’s syscall dispatcher to
identify the requested service.  When you specify the syscall by its
name, <small>GDB</small> uses its database of syscalls to convert the name
into the corresponding numeric code, but using the number directly
may be useful if <small>GDB</small>’s database does not have the complete
list of syscalls on your system (e.g., because <small>GDB</small> lags
behind the OS upgrades).
</p>
<p>You may specify a group of related syscalls to be caught at once using
the <code>group:</code> syntax (<code>g:</code> is a shorter equivalent).  For
instance, on some platforms <small>GDB</small> allows you to catch all
network related syscalls, by passing the argument <code>group:network</code>
to <code>catch syscall</code>.  Note that not all syscall groups are
available in every system.  You can use the command completion
facilities (see <a href="#Completion">command completion</a>) to list the
syscall groups available on your environment.
</p>
<p>The example below illustrates how this command works if you don’t provide
arguments to it:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) catch syscall
Catchpoint 1 (syscall)
(gdb) r
Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall

Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall &#39;close&#39;), \

(gdb) c
Continuing.

Catchpoint 1 (returned from syscall &#39;close&#39;), \
	0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>Here is an example of catching a system call by name:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) catch syscall chroot
Catchpoint 1 (syscall &#39;chroot&#39; [61])
(gdb) r
Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall

Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall &#39;chroot&#39;), \
		   0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Catchpoint 1 (returned from syscall &#39;chroot&#39;), \
	0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>An example of specifying a system call numerically.  In the case
below, the syscall number has a corresponding entry in the XML
file, so <small>GDB</small> finds its name and prints it:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) catch syscall 252
Catchpoint 1 (syscall(s) &#39;exit_group&#39;)

<p>Here is an example of catching a syscall group:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) catch syscall group:process
Catchpoint 1 (syscalls &#39;exit&#39; [1] &#39;fork&#39; [2] &#39;waitpid&#39; [7]

   from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

(gdb) c
Continuing.
</pre></div>

<p>However, there can be situations when there is no corresponding name
in XML file for that syscall number.  In this case, <small>GDB</small> prints
a warning message saying that it was not able to find the syscall name,
but the catchpoint will be set anyway.  See the example below:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) catch syscall 764
warning: The number &#39;764&#39; does not represent a known syscall.
Catchpoint 2 (syscall 764)
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>If you configure <small>GDB</small> using the ‘<samp>--without-expat</samp>’ option,
it will not be able to display syscall names.  Also, if your
architecture does not have an XML file describing its system calls,
you will not be able to see the syscall names.  It is important to
notice that these two features are used for accessing the syscall
name database.  In either case, you will see a warning like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) catch syscall
warning: Could not open &#34;syscalls/i386-linux.xml&#34;
warning: Could not load the syscall XML file &#39;syscalls/i386-linux.xml&#39;.
GDB will not be able to display syscall names.
Catchpoint 1 (syscall)
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>Of course, the file name will change depending on your architecture and system.
</p>
<p>Still using the example above, you can also try to catch a syscall by its
number.  In this case, you would see something like:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) catch syscall 252
Catchpoint 1 (syscall(s) 252)
</pre></div>

<p>Again, in this case <small>GDB</small> would not be able to display syscall’s names.

<p>When a signal is caught by a catchpoint, the signal’s <code>stop</code> and

<a name="index-deleting-breakpoints_002c-watchpoints_002c-catchpoints"></a>
<p>It is often necessary to eliminate a breakpoint, watchpoint, or
catchpoint once it has done its job and you no longer want your program
to stop there.  This is called <em>deleting</em> the breakpoint.  A
breakpoint that has been deleted no longer exists; it is forgotten.
</p>
<p>With the <code>clear</code> command you can delete breakpoints according to
where they are in your program.  With the <code>delete</code> command you can
delete individual breakpoints, watchpoints, or catchpoints by specifying
their breakpoint numbers.
</p>
<p>It is not necessary to delete a breakpoint to proceed past it.  <small>GDB</small>
automatically ignores breakpoints on the first instruction to be executed
when you continue execution without changing the execution address.

<a name="Disabling"></a>

<a name="Disabling-Breakpoints"></a>
<h4>5.1.5 Disabling Breakpoints</h4>

<a name="index-enable_002fdisable-a-breakpoint"></a>
<p>Rather than deleting a breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint, you might
prefer to <em>disable</em> it.  This makes the breakpoint inoperative as if
it had been deleted, but remembers the information on the breakpoint so
that you can <em>enable</em> it again later.
</p>
<p>You disable and enable breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints with
the <code>enable</code> and <code>disable</code> commands, optionally specifying
one or more breakpoint numbers as arguments.  Use <code>info break</code> to
print a list of all breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints if you
do not know which numbers to use.
</p>
<p>Disabling and enabling a breakpoint that has multiple locations
affects all of its locations.
</p>
<p>A breakpoint, watchpoint, or catchpoint can have any of several
different states of enablement:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Enabled.  The breakpoint stops your program.  A breakpoint set
with the <code>break</code> command starts out in this state.
</li><li> Disabled.  The breakpoint has no effect on your program.
</li><li> Enabled once.  The breakpoint stops your program, but then becomes
disabled.
</li><li> Enabled for a count.  The breakpoint stops your program for the next
N times, then becomes disabled.
</li><li> Enabled for deletion.  The breakpoint stops your program, but
immediately after it does so it is deleted permanently.  A breakpoint
set with the <code>tbreak</code> command starts out in this state.
</li></ul>

<p>You can use the following commands to enable or disable breakpoints,
watchpoints, and catchpoints:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-disable"></a>
<a name="index-dis-_0028disable_0029"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>disable <span>[</span>breakpoints<span>]</span> <span>[</span><var>list</var>…<span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Disable the specified breakpoints—or all breakpoints, if none are
listed.  A disabled breakpoint has no effect but is not forgotten.  All
options such as ignore-counts, conditions and commands are remembered in
case the breakpoint is enabled again later.  You may abbreviate
<code>disable</code> as <code>dis</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-enable"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>enable <span>[</span>breakpoints<span>]</span> <span>[</span><var>list</var>…<span>]</span></code></dt>

become effective once again in stopping your program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>enable <span>[</span>breakpoints<span>]</span> once <var>list</var>…</code></dt>
<dd><p>Enable the specified breakpoints temporarily.  <small>GDB</small> disables any
of these breakpoints immediately after stopping your program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>enable <span>[</span>breakpoints<span>]</span> count <var>count</var> <var>list</var>…</code></dt>
<dd><p>Enable the specified breakpoints temporarily.  <small>GDB</small> records
<var>count</var> with each of the specified breakpoints, and decrements a
breakpoint’s count when it is hit.  When any count reaches 0,
<small>GDB</small> disables that breakpoint.  If a breakpoint has an ignore
count (see <a href="#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>), that will be
decremented to 0 before <var>count</var> is affected.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>enable <span>[</span>breakpoints<span>]</span> delete <var>list</var>…</code></dt>
<dd><p>Enable the specified breakpoints to work once, then die.  <small>GDB</small>
deletes any of these breakpoints as soon as your program stops there.
Breakpoints set by the <code>tbreak</code> command start out in this state.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Except for a breakpoint set with <code>tbreak</code> (see <a href="#Set-Breaks">Setting Breakpoints</a>), breakpoints that you set are initially enabled;
subsequently, they become disabled or enabled only when you use one of
the commands above.  (The command <code>until</code> can set and delete a
breakpoint of its own, but it does not change the state of your other
breakpoints; see <a href="#Continuing-and-Stepping">Continuing and
Stepping</a>.)

<hr/>
<a name="Conditions"></a>

<a name="Break-Conditions"></a>
<h4>5.1.6 Break Conditions</h4>
<a name="index-conditional-breakpoints"></a>
<a name="index-breakpoint-conditions"></a>

<p>The simplest sort of breakpoint breaks every time your program reaches a
specified place.  You can also specify a <em>condition</em> for a
breakpoint.  A condition is just a Boolean expression in your
programming language (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>).  A breakpoint with
a condition evaluates the expression each time your program reaches it,
and your program stops only if the condition is <em>true</em>.
</p>
<p>This is the converse of using assertions for program validation; in that
situation, you want to stop when the assertion is violated—that is,
when the condition is false.  In C, if you want to test an assertion expressed
by the condition <var>assert</var>, you should set the condition
‘<samp>! <var>assert</var></samp>’ on the appropriate breakpoint.
</p>
<p>Conditions are also accepted for watchpoints; you may not need them,
since a watchpoint is inspecting the value of an expression anyhow—but
it might be simpler, say, to just set a watchpoint on a variable name,
and specify a condition that tests whether the new value is an interesting
one.
</p>
<p>Break conditions can have side effects, and may even call functions in
your program.  This can be useful, for example, to activate functions
that log program progress, or to use your own print functions to
format special data structures.  The effects are completely predictable
unless there is another enabled breakpoint at the same address.  (In
that case, <small>GDB</small> might see the other breakpoint first and stop your
program without checking the condition of this one.)  Note that
breakpoint commands are usually more convenient and flexible than break
conditions for the
purpose of performing side effects when a breakpoint is reached
(see <a href="#Break-Commands">Breakpoint Command Lists</a>).
</p>
<p>Breakpoint conditions can also be evaluated on the target’s side if
the target supports it.  Instead of evaluating the conditions locally,
<small>GDB</small> encodes the expression into an agent expression
(see <a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>) suitable for execution on the target,
independently of <small>GDB</small>.  Global variables become raw memory
locations, locals become stack accesses, and so forth.
</p>
<p>In this case, <small>GDB</small> will only be notified of a breakpoint trigger
when its condition evaluates to true.  This mechanism may provide faster
response times depending on the performance characteristics of the target
since it does not need to keep <small>GDB</small> informed about
every breakpoint trigger, even those with false conditions.
</p>
<p>Break conditions can be specified when a breakpoint is set, by using
‘<samp>if</samp>’ in the arguments to the <code>break</code> command.  See <a href="#Set-Breaks">Setting Breakpoints</a>.  They can also be changed at any time
with the <code>condition</code> command.
</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>if</code> keyword with the <code>watch</code> command.
The <code>catch</code> command does not recognize the <code>if</code> keyword;
<code>condition</code> is the only way to impose a further condition on a
catchpoint.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-condition"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>condition <var>bnum</var> <var>expression</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specify <var>expression</var> as the break condition for breakpoint,
watchpoint, or catchpoint number <var>bnum</var>.  After you set a condition,
breakpoint <var>bnum</var> stops your program only if the value of
<var>expression</var> is true (nonzero, in C).  When you use
<code>condition</code>, <small>GDB</small> checks <var>expression</var> immediately for
syntactic correctness, and to determine whether symbols in it have
referents in the context of your breakpoint.  If <var>expression</var> uses
symbols not referenced in the context of the breakpoint, <small>GDB</small>
prints an error message:
</p>
<div>
<pre>No symbol &#34;foo&#34; in current context.
</pre></div>

<p><small>GDB</small> does
not actually evaluate <var>expression</var> at the time the <code>condition</code>
command (or a command that sets a breakpoint with a condition, like
<code>break if …</code>) is given, however.  See <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>condition -force <var>bnum</var> <var>expression</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>When the <code>-force</code> flag is used, define the condition even if

<var>bnum</var>.  This is similar to the <code>-force-condition</code> option

</p>
</dd>

</dl>

<a name="index-ignore-count-_0028of-breakpoint_0029"></a>
<p>A special case of a breakpoint condition is to stop only when the
breakpoint has been reached a certain number of times.  This is so
useful that there is a special way to do it, using the <em>ignore
count</em> of the breakpoint.  Every breakpoint has an ignore count, which
is an integer.  Most of the time, the ignore count is zero, and
therefore has no effect.  But if your program reaches a breakpoint whose
ignore count is positive, then instead of stopping, it just decrements
the ignore count by one and continues.  As a result, if the ignore count
value is <var>n</var>, the breakpoint does not stop the next <var>n</var> times
your program reaches it.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-ignore"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>ignore <var>bnum</var> <var>count</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set the ignore count of breakpoint number <var>bnum</var> to <var>count</var>.
The next <var>count</var> times the breakpoint is reached, your program’s
execution does not stop; other than to decrement the ignore count, <small>GDB</small>
takes no action.
</p>
<p>To make the breakpoint stop the next time it is reached, specify
a count of zero.
</p>
<p>When you use <code>continue</code> to resume execution of your program from a
breakpoint, you can specify an ignore count directly as an argument to
<code>continue</code>, rather than using <code>ignore</code>.  See <a href="#Continuing-and-Stepping">Continuing and Stepping</a>.
</p>
<p>If a breakpoint has a positive ignore count and a condition, the
condition is not checked.  Once the ignore count reaches zero,
<small>GDB</small> resumes checking the condition.
</p>
<p>You could achieve the effect of the ignore count with a condition such
as ‘<samp><span>$foo--</span> &lt;= 0</samp>’<!-- /@w --> using a debugger convenience variable that
is decremented each time.  See <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience
Variables</a>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Ignore counts apply to breakpoints, watchpoints, and catchpoints.

<a name="Break-Commands"></a>

<a name="Breakpoint-Command-Lists"></a>
<h4>5.1.7 Breakpoint Command Lists</h4>

<a name="index-breakpoint-commands"></a>
<p>You can give any breakpoint (or watchpoint or catchpoint) a series of
commands to execute when your program stops due to that breakpoint.  For
example, you might want to print the values of certain expressions, or
enable other breakpoints.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-commands"></a>
<a name="index-end-_0028breakpoint-commands_0029"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>commands <span>[</span><var>list</var>…<span>]</span></code></dt>
<dt><code>… <var>command-list</var> …</code></dt>
<dt><code>end</code></dt>
<dd><p>Specify a list of commands for the given breakpoints.  The commands
themselves appear on the following lines.  Type a line containing just
<code>end</code> to terminate the commands.
</p>
<p>To remove all commands from a breakpoint, type <code>commands</code> and
follow it immediately with <code>end</code>; that is, give no commands.
</p>
<p>With no argument, <code>commands</code> refers to the last breakpoint,
watchpoint, or catchpoint set (not to the breakpoint most recently
encountered).  If the most recent breakpoints were set with a single
command, then the <code>commands</code> will apply to all the breakpoints
set by that command.  This applies to breakpoints set by
<code>rbreak</code>, and also applies when a single <code>break</code> command
creates multiple breakpoints (see <a href="#Ambiguous-Expressions">Ambiguous
Expressions</a>).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Pressing <tt>RET</tt> as a means of repeating the last <small>GDB</small> command is
disabled within a <var>command-list</var>.
</p>
<p>You can use breakpoint commands to start your program up again.  Simply
use the <code>continue</code> command, or <code>step</code>, or any other command
that resumes execution.
</p>
<p>Any other commands in the command list, after a command that resumes
execution, are ignored.  This is because any time you resume execution
(even with a simple <code>next</code> or <code>step</code>), you may encounter
another breakpoint—which could have its own command list, leading to
ambiguities about which list to execute.
</p>
<a name="index-silent"></a>
<p>If the first command you specify in a command list is <code>silent</code>, the
usual message about stopping at a breakpoint is not printed.  This may
be desirable for breakpoints that are to print a specific message and
then continue.  If none of the remaining commands print anything, you
see no sign that the breakpoint was reached.  <code>silent</code> is
meaningful only at the beginning of a breakpoint command list.
</p>
<p>The commands <code>echo</code>, <code>output</code>, and <code>printf</code> allow you to
print precisely controlled output, and are often useful in silent
breakpoints.  See <a href="#Output">Commands for Controlled Output</a>.
</p>
<p>For example, here is how you could use breakpoint commands to print the
value of <code>x</code> at entry to <code>foo</code> whenever <code>x</code> is positive.
</p>
<div>
<pre>break foo if x&gt;0
commands
silent
printf &#34;x is %d\n&#34;,x
cont
end
</pre></div>

<p>One application for breakpoint commands is to compensate for one bug so
you can test for another.  Put a breakpoint just after the erroneous line
of code, give it a condition to detect the case in which something
erroneous has been done, and give it commands to assign correct values
to any variables that need them.  End with the <code>continue</code> command
so that your program does not stop, and start with the <code>silent</code>
command so that no output is produced.  Here is an example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>break 403
commands
silent
set x = y + 4
cont
end
</pre></div>

<h4>5.1.8 Dynamic Printf</h4>

<a name="index-dynamic-printf"></a>
<a name="index-dprintf"></a>
<p>The dynamic printf command <code>dprintf</code> combines a breakpoint with
formatted printing of your program’s data to give you the effect of
inserting <code>printf</code> calls into your program on-the-fly, without
having to recompile it.
</p>
<p>In its most basic form, the output goes to the GDB console.  However,
you can set the variable <code>dprintf-style</code> for alternate handling.
For instance, you can ask to format the output by calling your
program’s <code>printf</code> function.  This has the advantage that the
characters go to the program’s output device, so they can recorded in
redirects to files and so forth.
</p>
<p>If you are doing remote debugging with a stub or agent, you can also
ask to have the printf handled by the remote agent.  In addition to
ensuring that the output goes to the remote program’s device along
with any other output the program might produce, you can also ask that
the dprintf remain active even after disconnecting from the remote
target.  Using the stub/agent is also more efficient, as it can do
everything without needing to communicate with <small>GDB</small>.

<h4>5.1.10 Static Probe Points</h4>

<a name="index-static-probe-point_002c-SystemTap"></a>
<a name="index-static-probe-point_002c-DTrace"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> supports <em>SDT</em> probes in the code.  <acronym>SDT</acronym> stands
for Statically Defined Tracing, and the probes are designed to have a tiny
runtime code and data footprint, and no dynamic relocations.
</p>
<p>Currently, the following types of probes are supported on
ELF-compatible systems:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>SystemTap</code> (<a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/">http://sourceware.org/systemtap/</a>)
<acronym>SDT</acronym> probes<a name="DOCF5" href="#FOOT5"><sup>5</sup></a>.  <code>SystemTap</code> probes are usable
from assembly, C and C<tt>++</tt> languages<a name="DOCF6" href="#FOOT6"><sup>6</sup></a>.  

</li><li> <code>DTrace</code> (<a href="http://oss.oracle.com/projects/DTrace">http://oss.oracle.com/projects/DTrace</a>)
<acronym>USDT</acronym> probes.  <code>DTrace</code> probes are usable from C and
C<tt>++</tt> languages.
</li></ul>

<a name="index-semaphores-on-static-probe-points"></a>
<p>Some <code>SystemTap</code> probes have an associated semaphore variable;
for instance, this happens automatically if you defined your probe
using a DTrace-style <samp>.d</samp> file.  If your probe has a semaphore,
<small>GDB</small> will automatically enable it when you specify a
breakpoint using the ‘<samp>-probe-stap</samp>’ notation.  But, if you put a
breakpoint at a probe’s location by some other method (e.g.,
<code>break file:line</code>), then <small>GDB</small> will not automatically set
the semaphore.  <code>DTrace</code> probes do not support semaphores.
</p>
<p>You can examine the available static static probes using <code>info
probes</code>, with optional arguments:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<dd><p>If given, <var>type</var> is either <code>stap</code> for listing
<code>SystemTap</code> probes or <code>dtrace</code> for listing <code>DTrace</code>

names when selecting which probes to list.  If omitted, probes by all
probes from all providers are listed.
</p>

when selecting which probes to list.  If omitted, probe names are not
considered when deciding whether to display them.
</p>

object files (executable or shared libraries) to examine.  If not
given, all object files are considered.

<a name="index-enabling-and-disabling-probes"></a>
<p>Some probe points can be enabled and/or disabled.  The effect of
enabling or disabling a probe depends on the type of probe being
handled.  Some <code>DTrace</code> probes can be enabled or
disabled, but <code>SystemTap</code> probes cannot be disabled.
</p>
<p>You can enable (or disable) one or more probes using the following
commands, with optional arguments:

</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-_0024_005fprobe_005farg_002c-convenience-variable"></a>
<p>A probe may specify up to twelve arguments.  These are available at the
point at which the probe is defined—that is, when the current PC is
at the probe’s location.  The arguments are available using the
convenience variables (see <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Vars</a>)
<code>$_probe_arg0</code>…<code>$_probe_arg11</code>.  In <code>SystemTap</code>
probes each probe argument is an integer of the appropriate size;
types are not preserved.  In <code>DTrace</code> probes types are preserved
provided that they are recognized as such by <small>GDB</small>; otherwise
the value of the probe argument will be a long integer.  The
convenience variable <code>$_probe_argc</code> holds the number of arguments
at the current probe point.
</p>
<p>These variables are always available, but attempts to access them at
any location other than a probe point will cause <small>GDB</small> to give
an error message.

<p>This message is printed when you attempt to resume the program, since
only then <small>GDB</small> knows exactly how many hardware breakpoints and

<h4>5.1.12 “Breakpoint address adjusted...”</h4>
<a name="index-breakpoint-address-adjusted"></a>

<p>Some processor architectures place constraints on the addresses at
which breakpoints may be placed.  For architectures thus constrained,
<small>GDB</small> will attempt to adjust the breakpoint’s address to comply
with the constraints dictated by the architecture.
</p>
<p>One example of such an architecture is the Fujitsu FR-V.  The FR-V is
a VLIW architecture in which a number of RISC-like instructions may be
bundled together for parallel execution.  The FR-V architecture
constrains the location of a breakpoint instruction within such a
bundle to the instruction with the lowest address.  <small>GDB</small>
honors this constraint by adjusting a breakpoint’s address to the
first in the bundle.
</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for optimized code to have bundles which contain
instructions from different source statements, thus it may happen that
a breakpoint’s address will be adjusted from one source statement to
another.  Since this adjustment may significantly alter <small>GDB</small>’s
breakpoint related behavior from what the user expects, a warning is
printed when the breakpoint is first set and also when the breakpoint
is hit.
</p>
<p>A warning like the one below is printed when setting a breakpoint
that’s been subject to address adjustment:
</p>
<div>
<pre>warning: Breakpoint address adjusted from 0x00010414 to 0x00010410.
</pre></div>

<p>Such warnings are printed both for user settable and <small>GDB</small>’s
internal breakpoints.  If you see one of these warnings, you should
verify that a breakpoint set at the adjusted address will have the
desired affect.  If not, the breakpoint in question may be removed and
other breakpoints may be set which will have the desired behavior.
E.g., it may be sufficient to place the breakpoint at a later
instruction.  A conditional breakpoint may also be useful in some
cases to prevent the breakpoint from triggering too often.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> will also issue a warning when stopping at one of these
adjusted breakpoints:
</p>
<div>
<pre>warning: Breakpoint 1 address previously adjusted from 0x00010414
to 0x00010410.
</pre></div>

<p>When this warning is encountered, it may be too late to take remedial
action except in cases where the breakpoint is hit earlier or more
frequently than expected.

<h3>5.2 Continuing and Stepping</h3>

<a name="index-stepping"></a>
<a name="index-continuing"></a>
<a name="index-resuming-execution"></a>
<p><em>Continuing</em> means resuming program execution until your program
completes normally.  In contrast, <em>stepping</em> means executing just
one more “step” of your program, where “step” may mean either one
line of source code, or one machine instruction (depending on what
particular command you use).  Either when continuing or when stepping,
your program may stop even sooner, due to a breakpoint or a signal.  (If
it stops due to a signal, you may want to use <code>handle</code>, or use
‘<samp>signal 0</samp>’ to resume execution (see <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>),
or you may step into the signal’s handler (see <a href="#stepping-and-signal-handlers">stepping and signal handlers</a>).)

<dt><code>fg <span>[</span><var>ignore-count</var><span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Resume program execution, at the address where your program last stopped;
any breakpoints set at that address are bypassed.  The optional argument
<var>ignore-count</var> allows you to specify a further number of times to
ignore a breakpoint at this location; its effect is like that of
<code>ignore</code> (see <a href="#Conditions">Break Conditions</a>).
</p>
<p>The argument <var>ignore-count</var> is meaningful only when your program
stopped due to a breakpoint.  At other times, the argument to
<code>continue</code> is ignored.
</p>
<p>The synonyms <code>c</code> and <code>fg</code> (for <em>foreground</em>, as the
debugged program is deemed to be the foreground program) are provided
purely for convenience, and have exactly the same behavior as
<code>continue</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>To resume execution at a different place, you can use <code>return</code>
(see <a href="#Returning">Returning from a Function</a>) to go back to the
calling function; or <code>jump</code> (see <a href="#Jumping">Continuing at a
Different Address</a>) to go to an arbitrary location in your program.
</p>
<p>A typical technique for using stepping is to set a breakpoint
(see <a href="#Breakpoints">Breakpoints; Watchpoints; and Catchpoints</a>) at the
beginning of the function or the section of your program where a problem
is believed to lie, run your program until it stops at that breakpoint,
and then step through the suspect area, examining the variables that are
interesting, until you see the problem happen.

<dd><p>Continue running your program until control reaches a different source

</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Warning:</em> If you use the <code>step</code> command while control is
within a function that was compiled without debugging information,
execution proceeds until control reaches a function that does have
debugging information.  Likewise, it will not step into a function which
is compiled without debugging information.  To step through functions
without debugging information, use the <code>stepi</code> command, described
below.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The <code>step</code> command only stops at the first instruction of a source
line.  This prevents the multiple stops that could otherwise occur in
<code>switch</code> statements, <code>for</code> loops, etc.  <code>step</code> continues
to stop if a function that has debugging information is called within
the line.  In other words, <code>step</code> <em>steps inside</em> any functions
called within the line.
</p>
<p>Also, the <code>step</code> command only enters a function if there is line
number information for the function.  Otherwise it acts like the
<code>next</code> command.  This avoids problems when using <code>cc -gl</code>
on <acronym>MIPS</acronym> machines.  Previously, <code>step</code> entered subroutines if there

<dd><p>Continue running until a source line past the current line, in the

stepping through a loop more than once.  It is like the <code>next</code>
command, except that when <code>until</code> encounters a jump, it
automatically continues execution until the program counter is greater
than the address of the jump.
</p>
<p>This means that when you reach the end of a loop after single stepping
though it, <code>until</code> makes your program continue execution until it
exits the loop.  In contrast, a <code>next</code> command at the end of a loop
simply steps back to the beginning of the loop, which forces you to step
through the next iteration.
</p>
<p><code>until</code> always stops your program if it attempts to exit the current
stack frame.
</p>
<p><code>until</code> may produce somewhat counterintuitive results if the order
of machine code does not match the order of the source lines.  For
example, in the following excerpt from a debugging session, the <code>f</code>
(<code>frame</code>) command shows that execution is stopped at line
<code>206</code>; yet when we use <code>until</code>, we get to line <code>195</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) f
#0  main (argc=4, argv=0xf7fffae8) at m4.c:206
206                 expand_input();
(gdb) until
195             for ( ; argc &gt; 0; NEXTARG) {
</pre></div>

<p>This happened because, for execution efficiency, the compiler had
generated code for the loop closure test at the end, rather than the
start, of the loop—even though the test in a C <code>for</code>-loop is
written before the body of the loop.  The <code>until</code> command appeared
to step back to the beginning of the loop when it advanced to this
expression; however, it has not really gone to an earlier
statement—not in terms of the actual machine code.
</p>
<p><code>until</code> with no argument works by means of single
instruction stepping, and hence is slower than <code>until</code> with an
argument.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>until <var>location</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>u <var>location</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Continue running your program until either the specified <var>location</var> is
reached, or the current stack frame returns.  The location is any of
the forms described in <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>.
This form of the command uses temporary breakpoints, and
hence is quicker than <code>until</code> without an argument.  The specified
location is actually reached only if it is in the current frame.  This
implies that <code>until</code> can be used to skip over recursive function
invocations.  For instance in the code below, if the current location is
line <code>96</code>, issuing <code>until 99</code> will execute the program up to
line <code>99</code> in the same invocation of factorial, i.e., after the inner
invocations have returned.
</p>
<div>
<pre>94	int factorial (int value)
95	{
96	    if (value &gt; 1) {
97            value *= factorial (value - 1);

Execution will also stop upon exit from the current stack

<p>By default, and if available, <small>GDB</small> makes use of
target-assisted <em>range stepping</em>.  In other words, whenever you
use a stepping command (e.g., <code>step</code>, <code>next</code>), <small>GDB</small>
tells the target to step the corresponding range of instruction
addresses instead of issuing multiple single-steps.  This speeds up
line stepping, particularly for remote targets.  Ideally, there should
be no reason you would want to turn range stepping off.  However, it’s
possible that a bug in the debug info, a bug in the remote stub (for
remote targets), or even a bug in <small>GDB</small> could make line
stepping behave incorrectly when target-assisted range stepping is
enabled.  You can use the following command to turn off range stepping
if necessary:

<h3>5.3 Skipping Over Functions and Files</h3>
<a name="index-skipping-over-functions-and-files"></a>

<p>The program you are debugging may contain some functions which are
uninteresting to debug.  The <code>skip</code> command lets you tell <small>GDB</small> to
skip a function, all functions in a file or a particular function in
a particular file when stepping.
</p>
<p>For example, consider the following C function:
</p>
<div>
<pre>101     int func()
102     {
103         foo(boring());
104         bar(boring());
105     }
</pre></div>

<p>Suppose you wish to step into the functions <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, but you
are not interested in stepping through <code>boring</code>.  If you run <code>step</code>
at line 103, you’ll enter <code>boring()</code>, but if you run <code>next</code>, you’ll
step over both <code>foo</code> and <code>boring</code>!
</p>
<p>One solution is to <code>step</code> into <code>boring</code> and use the <code>finish</code>
command to immediately exit it.  But this can become tedious if <code>boring</code>
is called from many places.
</p>
<p>A more flexible solution is to execute <kbd>skip boring</kbd>.  This instructs
<small>GDB</small> never to step into <code>boring</code>.  Now when you execute
<code>step</code> at line 103, you’ll step over <code>boring</code> and directly into
<code>foo</code>.
</p>
<p>Functions may be skipped by providing either a function name, linespec
(see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>), regular expression that matches the function’s
name, file name or a <code>glob</code>-style pattern that matches the file name.
</p>
<p>On Posix systems the form of the regular expression is
“Extended Regular Expressions”.  See for example ‘<samp>man 7 regex</samp>’
on <small>GNU</small>/Linux systems.  On non-Posix systems the form of the regular
expression is whatever is provided by the <code>regcomp</code> function of
the underlying system.
See for example ‘<samp>man 7 glob</samp>’ on <small>GNU</small>/Linux systems for a
description of <code>glob</code>-style patterns.

<a name="Signals"></a>

<a name="Signals-1"></a>
<h3>5.4 Signals</h3>
<a name="index-signals"></a>

<p>A signal is an asynchronous event that can happen in a program.  The
operating system defines the possible kinds of signals, and gives each
kind a name and a number.  For example, in Unix <code>SIGINT</code> is the
signal a program gets when you type an interrupt character (often <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd>);
<code>SIGSEGV</code> is the signal a program gets from referencing a place in
memory far away from all the areas in use; <code>SIGALRM</code> occurs when
the alarm clock timer goes off (which happens only if your program has
requested an alarm).
</p>
<a name="index-fatal-signals"></a>
<p>Some signals, including <code>SIGALRM</code>, are a normal part of the
functioning of your program.  Others, such as <code>SIGSEGV</code>, indicate
errors; these signals are <em>fatal</em> (they kill your program immediately) if the
program has not specified in advance some other way to handle the signal.
<code>SIGINT</code> does not indicate an error in your program, but it is normally
fatal so it can carry out the purpose of the interrupt: to kill the program.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> has the ability to detect any occurrence of a signal in your
program.  You can tell <small>GDB</small> in advance what to do for each kind of
signal.
</p>
<a name="index-handling-signals"></a>
<p>Normally, <small>GDB</small> is set up to let the non-erroneous signals like
<code>SIGALRM</code> be silently passed to your program
(so as not to interfere with their role in the program’s functioning)
but to stop your program immediately whenever an error signal happens.
You can change these settings with the <code>handle</code> command.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<dd><p>Change the way <small>GDB</small> handles signal <var>signal</var>.  The <var>signal</var>
can be the number of a signal or its name (with or without the
‘<samp>SIG</samp>’ at the beginning); a list of signal numbers of the form
‘<samp><var>low</var>-<var>high</var></samp>’; or the word ‘<samp>all</samp>’, meaning all the
known signals.  Optional arguments <var>keywords</var>, described below,
say what change to make.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The keywords allowed by the <code>handle</code> command can be abbreviated.
Their full names are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>nostop</code></dt>
<dd><p><small>GDB</small> should not stop your program when this signal happens.  It may
still print a message telling you that the signal has come in.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>stop</code></dt>
<dd><p><small>GDB</small> should stop your program when this signal happens.  This implies
the <code>print</code> keyword as well.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>print</code></dt>
<dd><p><small>GDB</small> should print a message when this signal happens.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>noprint</code></dt>
<dd><p><small>GDB</small> should not mention the occurrence of the signal at all.  This
implies the <code>nostop</code> keyword as well.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>pass</code></dt>
<dt><code>noignore</code></dt>
<dd><p><small>GDB</small> should allow your program to see this signal; your program
can handle the signal, or else it may terminate if the signal is fatal
and not handled.  <code>pass</code> and <code>noignore</code> are synonyms.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>nopass</code></dt>
<dt><code>ignore</code></dt>
<dd><p><small>GDB</small> should not allow your program to see this signal.
<code>nopass</code> and <code>ignore</code> are synonyms.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>When a signal stops your program, the signal is not visible to the
program until you
continue.  Your program sees the signal then, if <code>pass</code> is in
effect for the signal in question <em>at that time</em>.  In other words,
after <small>GDB</small> reports a signal, you can use the <code>handle</code>
command with <code>pass</code> or <code>nopass</code> to control whether your
program sees that signal when you continue.
</p>
<p>The default is set to <code>nostop</code>, <code>noprint</code>, <code>pass</code> for
non-erroneous signals such as <code>SIGALRM</code>, <code>SIGWINCH</code> and
<code>SIGCHLD</code>, and to <code>stop</code>, <code>print</code>, <code>pass</code> for the
erroneous signals.
</p>
<p>You can also use the <code>signal</code> command to prevent your program from
seeing a signal, or cause it to see a signal it normally would not see,
or to give it any signal at any time.  For example, if your program stopped
due to some sort of memory reference error, you might store correct
values into the erroneous variables and continue, hoping to see more
execution; but your program would probably terminate immediately as
a result of the fatal signal once it saw the signal.  To prevent this,
you can continue with ‘<samp>signal 0</samp>’.  See <a href="#Signaling">Giving your
Program a Signal</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-stepping-and-signal-handlers"></a>
<a name="stepping-and-signal-handlers"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> optimizes for stepping the mainline code.  If a signal
that has <code>handle nostop</code> and <code>handle pass</code> set arrives while
a stepping command (e.g., <code>stepi</code>, <code>step</code>, <code>next</code>) is
in progress, <small>GDB</small> lets the signal handler run and then resumes
stepping the mainline code once the signal handler returns.  In other
words, <small>GDB</small> steps over the signal handler.  This prevents
signals that you’ve specified as not interesting (with <code>handle
nostop</code>) from changing the focus of debugging unexpectedly.  Note that
the signal handler itself may still hit a breakpoint, stop for another
signal that has <code>handle stop</code> in effect, or for any other event
that normally results in stopping the stepping command sooner.  Also
note that <small>GDB</small> still informs you that the program received a
signal if <code>handle print</code> is set.
</p>
<a name="stepping-into-signal-handlers"></a>
<p>If you set <code>handle pass</code> for a signal, and your program sets up a
handler for it, then issuing a stepping command, such as <code>step</code>
or <code>stepi</code>, when your program is stopped due to the signal will
step <em>into</em> the signal handler (if the target supports that).
</p>
<p>Likewise, if you use the <code>queue-signal</code> command to queue a signal
to be delivered to the current thread when execution of the thread
resumes (see <a href="#Signaling">Giving your Program a Signal</a>), then a
stepping command will step into the signal handler.
</p>
<p>Here’s an example, using <code>stepi</code> to step to the first instruction
of <code>SIGUSR1</code>’s handler:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) handle SIGUSR1
Signal        Stop      Print   Pass to program Description
SIGUSR1       Yes       Yes     Yes             User defined signal 1
(gdb) c
Continuing.

Program received signal SIGUSR1, User defined signal 1.
main () sigusr1.c:28
28        p = 0;
(gdb) si
sigusr1_handler () at sigusr1.c:9
9       {
</pre></div>

<p>The same, but using <code>queue-signal</code> instead of waiting for the
program to receive the signal first:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) n
28        p = 0;
(gdb) queue-signal SIGUSR1
(gdb) si
sigusr1_handler () at sigusr1.c:9
9       {
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<a name="index-extra-signal-information"></a>
<a name="extra-signal-information"></a>
<p>On some targets, <small>GDB</small> can inspect extra signal information
associated with the intercepted signal, before it is actually
delivered to the program being debugged.  This information is exported
by the convenience variable <code>$_siginfo</code>, and consists of data
that is passed by the kernel to the signal handler at the time of the
receipt of a signal.  The data type of the information itself is
target dependent.  You can see the data type using the <code>ptype
$_siginfo</code> command.  On Unix systems, it typically corresponds to the
standard <code>siginfo_t</code> type, as defined in the <samp>signal.h</samp>
system header.
</p>
<p>Here’s an example, on a <small>GNU</small>/Linux system, printing the stray
referenced address that raised a segmentation fault.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) continue
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x0000000000400766 in main ()
69        *(int *)p = 0;
(gdb) ptype $_siginfo
type = struct {
    int si_signo;
    int si_errno;
    int si_code;
    union {
        int _pad[28];
        struct {...} _kill;
        struct {...} _timer;
        struct {...} _rt;
        struct {...} _sigchld;
        struct {...} _sigfault;
        struct {...} _sigpoll;
    } _sifields;
}
(gdb) ptype $_siginfo._sifields._sigfault
type = struct {
    void *si_addr;
}
(gdb) p $_siginfo._sifields._sigfault.si_addr
$1 = (void *) 0x7ffff7ff7000
</pre></div>

<p>Depending on target support, <code>$_siginfo</code> may also be writable.
</p>
<a name="index-Intel-MPX-boundary-violations"></a>
<a name="index-boundary-violations_002c-Intel-MPX"></a>
<p>On some targets, a <code>SIGSEGV</code> can be caused by a boundary
violation, i.e., accessing an address outside of the allowed range.
In those cases <small>GDB</small> may displays additional information,
depending on how <small>GDB</small> has been told to handle the signal.
With <code>handle stop SIGSEGV</code>, <small>GDB</small> displays the violation
kind: &#34;Upper&#34; or &#34;Lower&#34;, the memory address accessed and the
bounds, while with <code>handle nostop SIGSEGV</code> no additional
information is displayed.
</p>
<p>The usual output of a segfault is:
</p><div>
<pre>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
0x0000000000400d7c in upper () at i386-mpx-sigsegv.c:68
68        value = *(p + len);
</pre></div>

<p>While a bound violation is presented as:
</p><div>
<pre>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
Upper bound violation while accessing address 0x7fffffffc3b3
Bounds: [lower = 0x7fffffffc390, upper = 0x7fffffffc3a3]
0x0000000000400d7c in upper () at i386-mpx-sigsegv.c:68

<p><small>GDB</small> supports debugging programs with multiple threads
(see <a href="#Threads">Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads</a>).  There
are two modes of controlling execution of your program within the
debugger.  In the default mode, referred to as <em>all-stop mode</em>,
when any thread in your program stops (for example, at a breakpoint 
or while being stepped), all other threads in the program are also stopped by 
<small>GDB</small>.  On some targets, <small>GDB</small> also supports 
<em>non-stop mode</em>, in which other threads can continue to run freely while
you examine the stopped thread in the debugger.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="All_002dStop-Mode"></a>

<a name="All_002dStop-Mode-1"></a>
<h4>5.5.1 All-Stop Mode</h4>

<a name="index-all_002dstop-mode"></a>

<p>In all-stop mode, whenever your program stops under <small>GDB</small> for any reason,
<em>all</em> threads of execution stop, not just the current thread.  This
allows you to examine the overall state of the program, including
switching between threads, without worrying that things may change
underfoot.
</p>
<p>Conversely, whenever you restart the program, <em>all</em> threads start
executing.  <em>This is true even when single-stepping</em> with commands
like <code>step</code> or <code>next</code>.
</p>
<p>In particular, <small>GDB</small> cannot single-step all threads in lockstep.
Since thread scheduling is up to your debugging target’s operating
system (not controlled by <small>GDB</small>), other threads may
execute more than one statement while the current thread completes a
single step.  Moreover, in general other threads stop in the middle of a
statement, rather than at a clean statement boundary, when the program
stops.
</p>
<p>You might even find your program stopped in another thread after
continuing or even single-stepping.  This happens whenever some other
thread runs into a breakpoint, a signal, or an exception before the
first thread completes whatever you requested.
</p>
<a name="index-automatic-thread-selection"></a>
<a name="index-switching-threads-automatically"></a>
<a name="index-threads_002c-automatic-switching"></a>
<p>Whenever <small>GDB</small> stops your program, due to a breakpoint or a
signal, it automatically selects the thread where that breakpoint or
signal happened.  <small>GDB</small> alerts you to the context switch with a
message such as ‘<samp>[Switching to Thread <var>n</var>]</samp>’ to identify the
thread.  
</p>
<p>On some OSes, you can modify <small>GDB</small>’s default behavior by
locking the OS scheduler to allow only a single thread to run.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set scheduler-locking <var>mode</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-scheduler-locking-mode"></a>
<a name="index-lock-scheduler"></a>
<p>Set the scheduler locking mode.  It applies to normal execution,
record mode, and replay mode.  If it is <code>off</code>, then there is no
locking and any thread may run at any time.  If <code>on</code>, then only
the current thread may run when the inferior is resumed.  The
<code>step</code> mode optimizes for single-stepping; it prevents other
threads from preempting the current thread while you are stepping, so
that the focus of debugging does not change unexpectedly.  Other
threads never get a chance to run when you step, and they are
completely free to run when you use commands like ‘<samp>continue</samp>’,
‘<samp>until</samp>’, or ‘<samp>finish</samp>’.  However, unless another thread hits a
breakpoint during its timeslice, <small>GDB</small> does not change the
current thread away from the thread that you are debugging.  The
<code>replay</code> mode behaves like <code>off</code> in record mode and like
<code>on</code> in replay mode.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show scheduler-locking</code></dt>
<dd><p>Display the current scheduler locking mode.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-resume-threads-of-multiple-processes-simultaneously"></a>
<p>By default, when you issue one of the execution commands such as
<code>continue</code>, <code>next</code> or <code>step</code>, <small>GDB</small> allows only
threads of the current inferior to run.  For example, if <small>GDB</small>
is attached to two inferiors, each with two threads, the
<code>continue</code> command resumes only the two threads of the current
inferior.  This is useful, for example, when you debug a program that
forks and you want to hold the parent stopped (so that, for instance,
it doesn’t run to exit), while you debug the child.  In other
situations, you may not be interested in inspecting the current state
of any of the processes <small>GDB</small> is attached to, and you may want
to resume them all until some breakpoint is hit.  In the latter case,
you can instruct <small>GDB</small> to allow all threads of all the
inferiors to run with the <code>set <span>schedule-multiple</span></code><!-- /@w --> command.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<code>scheduler-locking</code> mode takes precedence when set to <code>on</code>,
or while you are stepping and set to <code>step</code>.

<a name="Non_002dStop-Mode"></a>

<a name="Non_002dStop-Mode-1"></a>
<h4>5.5.2 Non-Stop Mode</h4>

<a name="index-non_002dstop-mode"></a>


<p>For some multi-threaded targets, <small>GDB</small> supports an optional
mode of operation in which you can examine stopped program threads in
the debugger while other threads continue to execute freely.  This
minimizes intrusion when debugging live systems, such as programs
where some threads have real-time constraints or must continue to
respond to external events.  This is referred to as <em>non-stop</em> mode.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, when a thread stops to report a debugging event,
<em>only</em> that thread is stopped; <small>GDB</small> does not stop other
threads as well, in contrast to the all-stop mode behavior.  Additionally,
execution commands such as <code>continue</code> and <code>step</code> apply by default
only to the current thread in non-stop mode, rather than all threads as
in all-stop mode.  This allows you to control threads explicitly in
ways that are not possible in all-stop mode — for example, stepping
one thread while allowing others to run freely, stepping
one thread while holding all others stopped, or stepping several threads
independently and simultaneously.
</p>
<p>To enter non-stop mode, use this sequence of commands before you run
or attach to your program:
</p>
<div>
<pre># If using the CLI, pagination breaks non-stop.
set pagination off

# Finally, turn it on!
set non-stop on
</pre></div>

<p>You can use these commands to manipulate the non-stop mode setting:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-non_002dstop"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set non-stop on</code></dt>
<dd><p>Enable selection of non-stop mode.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>set non-stop off</code></dt>
<dd><p>Disable selection of non-stop mode.
<a name="index-show-non_002dstop"></a>
</p></dd>
<dt><code>show non-stop</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show the current non-stop enablement setting.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Note these commands only reflect whether non-stop mode is enabled,
not whether the currently-executing program is being run in non-stop mode.
In particular, the <code>set non-stop</code> preference is only consulted when
<small>GDB</small> starts or connects to the target program, and it is generally
not possible to switch modes once debugging has started.  Furthermore,
since not all targets support non-stop mode, even when you have enabled
non-stop mode, <small>GDB</small> may still fall back to all-stop operation by
default.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, all execution commands apply only to the current thread
by default.  That is, <code>continue</code> only continues one thread.
To continue all threads, issue <code>continue -a</code> or <code>c -a</code>.
</p>
<p>You can use <small>GDB</small>’s background execution commands
(see <a href="#Background-Execution">Background Execution</a>) to run some threads in the background
while you continue to examine or step others from <small>GDB</small>.
The MI execution commands (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Program-Execution">GDB/MI Program Execution</a>) are
always executed asynchronously in non-stop mode.
</p>
<p>Suspending execution is done with the <code>interrupt</code> command when
running in the background, or <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd> during foreground execution.
In all-stop mode, this stops the whole process;
but in non-stop mode the interrupt applies only to the current thread.
To stop the whole program, use <code>interrupt -a</code>.
</p>
<p>Other execution commands do not currently support the <code>-a</code> option.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, when a thread stops, <small>GDB</small> doesn’t automatically make
that thread current, as it does in all-stop mode.  This is because the
thread stop notifications are asynchronous with respect to <small>GDB</small>’s
command interpreter, and it would be confusing if <small>GDB</small> unexpectedly
changed to a different thread just as you entered a command to operate on the
previously current thread.

<h4>5.5.3 Background Execution</h4>

<a name="index-background-execution"></a>
<a name="index-asynchronous-execution"></a>
<a name="index-execution_002c-foreground_002c-background-and-asynchronous"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small>’s execution commands have two variants:  the normal
foreground (synchronous) behavior, and a background
(asynchronous) behavior.  In foreground execution, <small>GDB</small> waits for
the program to report that some thread has stopped before prompting for
another command.  In background execution, <small>GDB</small> immediately gives
a command prompt so that you can issue other commands while your program runs.
</p>
<p>If the target doesn’t support async mode, <small>GDB</small> issues an error
message if you attempt to use the background execution commands.
</p>
<a name="index-_0026_002c-background-execution-of-commands"></a>
<p>To specify background execution, add a <code>&amp;</code> to the command.  For example,
the background form of the <code>continue</code> command is <code>continue&amp;</code>, or
just <code>c&amp;</code>.  The execution commands that accept background execution
are:

</dl>

<p>Background execution is especially useful in conjunction with non-stop
mode for debugging programs with multiple threads; see <a href="#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>.
However, you can also use these commands in the normal all-stop mode with
the restriction that you cannot issue another execution command until the
previous one finishes.  Examples of commands that are valid in all-stop
mode while the program is running include <code>help</code> and <code>info break</code>.
</p>
<p>You can interrupt your program while it is running in the background by
using the <code>interrupt</code> command.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<p>Suspend execution of the running program.  In all-stop mode,

only the current thread.  To stop the whole program in non-stop mode,
use <code>interrupt -a</code>.

<a name="Thread_002dSpecific-Breakpoints-1"></a>
<h4>5.5.4 Thread-Specific Breakpoints</h4>

<p>When your program has multiple threads (see <a href="#Threads">Debugging
Programs with Multiple Threads</a>), you can choose whether to set
breakpoints on all threads, or on a particular thread.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-breakpoints-and-threads"></a>
<a name="index-thread-breakpoints"></a>
<a name="index-break-_2026-thread-thread_002did"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>break <var>location</var> thread <var>thread-id</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>break <var>location</var> thread <var>thread-id</var> if …</code></dt>
<dd><p><var>location</var> specifies source lines; there are several ways of
writing them (see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>), but the effect is always to
specify some source line.
</p>
<p>Use the qualifier ‘<samp>thread <var>thread-id</var></samp>’ with a breakpoint command
to specify that you only want <small>GDB</small> to stop the program when a
particular thread reaches this breakpoint.  The <var>thread-id</var> specifier
is one of the thread identifiers assigned by <small>GDB</small>, shown
in the first column of the ‘<samp>info threads</samp>’ display.
</p>
<p>If you do not specify ‘<samp>thread <var>thread-id</var></samp>’ when you set a
breakpoint, the breakpoint applies to <em>all</em> threads of your
program.
</p>
<p>You can use the <code>thread</code> qualifier on conditional breakpoints as
well; in this case, place ‘<samp>thread <var>thread-id</var></samp>’ before or
after the breakpoint condition, like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) break frik.c:13 thread 28 if bartab &gt; lim
</pre></div>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>Thread-specific breakpoints are automatically deleted when
<small>GDB</small> detects the corresponding thread is no longer in the
thread list.  For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) c
Thread-specific breakpoint 3 deleted - thread 28 no longer in the thread list.
</pre></div>

<p>There are several ways for a thread to disappear, such as a regular
thread exit, but also when you detach from the process with the
<code>detach</code> command (see <a href="#Attach">Debugging an Already-running
Process</a>), or if <small>GDB</small> loses the remote connection
(see <a href="#Remote-Debugging">Remote Debugging</a>), etc.  Note that with some targets,
<small>GDB</small> is only able to detect a thread has exited when the user
explictly asks for the thread list with the <code>info threads</code>
command.

<h4>5.5.5 Interrupted System Calls</h4>

<a name="index-thread-breakpoints-and-system-calls"></a>
<a name="index-system-calls-and-thread-breakpoints"></a>
<a name="index-premature-return-from-system-calls"></a>
<p>There is an unfortunate side effect when using <small>GDB</small> to debug
multi-threaded programs.  If one thread stops for a
breakpoint, or for some other reason, and another thread is blocked in a
system call, then the system call may return prematurely.  This is a
consequence of the interaction between multiple threads and the signals
that <small>GDB</small> uses to implement breakpoints and other events that
stop execution.
</p>
<p>To handle this problem, your program should check the return value of
each system call and react appropriately.  This is good programming
style anyways.
</p>
<p>For example, do not write code like this:
</p>


<p>The call to <code>sleep</code> will return early if a different thread stops
at a breakpoint or for some other reason.
</p>
<p>Instead, write this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  int unslept = 10;
  while (unslept &gt; 0)
    unslept = sleep (unslept);
</pre></div>

<p>A system call is allowed to return early, so the system is still
conforming to its specification.  But <small>GDB</small> does cause your
multi-threaded program to behave differently than it would without
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>Also, <small>GDB</small> uses internal breakpoints in the thread library to
monitor certain events such as thread creation and thread destruction.
When such an event happens, a system call in another thread may return
prematurely, even though your program does not appear to stop.
</p>

<a name="Observer-Mode"></a>

<a name="Observer-Mode-1"></a>
<h4>5.5.6 Observer Mode</h4>

<p>If you want to build on non-stop mode and observe program behavior
without any chance of disruption by <small>GDB</small>, you can set
variables to disable all of the debugger’s attempts to modify state,
whether by writing memory, inserting breakpoints, etc.  These operate
at a low level, intercepting operations from all commands.
</p>
<p>When all of these are set to <code>off</code>, then <small>GDB</small> is said to
be <em>observer mode</em>.  As a convenience, the variable
<code>observer</code> can be set to disable these, plus enable non-stop
mode.
</p>
<p>Note that <small>GDB</small> will not prevent you from making nonsensical
combinations of these settings. For instance, if you have enabled
<code>may-insert-breakpoints</code> but disabled <code>may-write-memory</code>,
then breakpoints that work by writing trap instructions into the code
stream will still not be able to be placed.

<a name="Reverse-Execution"></a>

<a name="Running-programs-backward"></a>
<h2>6 Running programs backward</h2>
<a name="index-reverse-execution"></a>
<a name="index-running-programs-backward"></a>

<p>When you are debugging a program, it is not unusual to realize that
you have gone too far, and some event of interest has already happened.
If the target environment supports it, <small>GDB</small> can allow you to
“rewind” the program by running it backward.
</p>
<p>A target environment that supports reverse execution should be able
to “undo” the changes in machine state that have taken place as the
program was executing normally.  Variables, registers etc. should
revert to their previous values.  Obviously this requires a great
deal of sophistication on the part of the target environment; not
all target environments can support reverse execution.
</p>
<p>When a program is executed in reverse, the instructions that
have most recently been executed are “un-executed”, in reverse
order.  The program counter runs backward, following the previous
thread of execution in reverse.  As each instruction is “un-executed”,
the values of memory and/or registers that were changed by that
instruction are reverted to their previous states.  After executing
a piece of source code in reverse, all side effects of that code
should be “undone”, and all variables should be returned to their
prior values<a name="DOCF7" href="#FOOT7"><sup>7</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>On some platforms, <small>GDB</small> has built-in support for reverse
execution, activated with the <code>record</code> or <code>record btrace</code>
commands.  See <a href="#Process-Record-and-Replay">Process Record and Replay</a>.  Some remote targets,
typically full system emulators, support reverse execution directly
without requiring any special command.
</p>
<p>If you are debugging in a target environment that supports
reverse execution, <small>GDB</small> provides the following commands.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-reverse_002dcontinue"></a>

<dt><code>rc <span>[</span><var>ignore-count</var><span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Beginning at the point where your program last stopped, start executing
in reverse.  Reverse execution will stop for breakpoints and synchronous
exceptions (signals), just like normal execution.  Behavior of
asynchronous signals depends on the target environment.

<dd><p>Run the program backward until control reaches the start of a
different source line; then stop it, and return control to <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>Like the <code>step</code> command, <code>reverse-step</code> will only stop
at the beginning of a source line.  It “un-executes” the previously
executed source line.  If the previous source line included calls to
debuggable functions, <code>reverse-step</code> will step (backward) into
the called function, stopping at the beginning of the <em>last</em>
statement in the called function (typically a return statement).
</p>
<p>Also, as with the <code>step</code> command, if non-debuggable functions are
called, <code>reverse-step</code> will run thru them backward without stopping.

<dd><p>Reverse-execute one machine instruction.  Note that the instruction
to be reverse-executed is <em>not</em> the one pointed to by the program

if the last instruction was a jump, <code>reverse-stepi</code> will take you
back from the destination of the jump to the jump instruction itself.

the first line of a function, <code>reverse-next</code> will take you back
to the caller of that function, <em>before</em> the function was called,
just as the normal <code>next</code> command would take you from the last 
line of a function back to its return to its caller

<h2>7 Recording Inferior’s Execution and Replaying It</h2>
<a name="index-process-record-and-replay"></a>
<a name="index-recording-inferior_0027s-execution-and-replaying-it"></a>

<p>On some platforms, <small>GDB</small> provides a special <em>process record
and replay</em> target that can record a log of the process execution, and
replay it later with both forward and reverse execution commands.
</p>
<a name="index-replay-mode"></a>
<p>When this target is in use, if the execution log includes the record
for the next instruction, <small>GDB</small> will debug in <em>replay
mode</em>.  In the replay mode, the inferior does not really execute code
instructions.  Instead, all the events that normally happen during
code execution are taken from the execution log.  While code is not
really executed in replay mode, the values of registers (including the
program counter register) and the memory of the inferior are still
changed as they normally would.  Their contents are taken from the
execution log.
</p>
<a name="index-record-mode"></a>
<p>If the record for the next instruction is not in the execution log,
<small>GDB</small> will debug in <em>record mode</em>.  In this mode, the
inferior executes normally, and <small>GDB</small> records the execution log
for future replay.
</p>
<p>The process record and replay target supports reverse execution
(see <a href="#Reverse-Execution">Reverse Execution</a>), even if the platform on which the
inferior runs does not.  However, the reverse execution is limited in
this case by the range of the instructions recorded in the execution
log.  In other words, reverse execution on platforms that don’t
support it directly can only be done in the replay mode.
</p>
<p>When debugging in the reverse direction, <small>GDB</small> will work in
replay mode as long as the execution log includes the record for the
previous instruction; otherwise, it will work in record mode, if the
platform supports reverse execution, or stop if not.
</p>
<p>Currently, process record and replay is supported on ARM, Aarch64,
Moxie, PowerPC, PowerPC64, S/390, and x86 (i386/amd64) running
GNU/Linux.  Process record and replay can be used both when native
debugging, and when remote debugging via <code>gdbserver</code>.
</p>
<p>For architecture environments that support process record and replay,
<small>GDB</small> provides the following commands:

<dd><a name="index-Intel-Processor-Trace"></a>
<p>Use the <em>Intel Processor Trace</em> recording format.  In this
format, the processor stores the execution trace in a compressed form
that is afterwards decoded by <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>The trace can be recorded with very low overhead.  The compressed
trace format also allows small trace buffers to already contain a big
number of instructions compared to <acronym>BTS</acronym>.
</p>
<p>Decoding the recorded execution trace, on the other hand, is more
expensive than decoding <acronym>BTS</acronym> trace.  This is mostly due to the
increased number of instructions to process.  You should increase the
buffer-size with care.

<p>Not all recording formats may be available on all processors.

<p>The process record and replay target can only debug a process that is
already running.  Therefore, you need first to start the process with
the <kbd>run</kbd> or <kbd>start</kbd> commands, and then start the recording
with the <kbd>record <var>method</var></kbd> command.

<a name="index-displaced-stepping_002c-and-process-record-and-replay"></a>
<p>Displaced stepping (see <a href="#Maintenance-Commands">displaced stepping</a>)

is started.  That’s because the process record and replay target

<dt><code>record stop</code></dt>
<dd><p>Stop the process record and replay target.  When process record and

<p>When you stop the process record and replay target in record mode (at
the end of the execution log), the inferior will be stopped at the
next instruction that would have been recorded.  In other words, if
you record for a while and then stop recording, the inferior process
will be left in the same state as if the recording never happened.
</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the process record and replay target is stopped
while in replay mode (that is, not at the end of the execution log,
but at some earlier point), the inferior process will become “live”
at that earlier state, and it will then be possible to continue the
usual “live” debugging of the process from that state.

<p>The <code>btrace</code> record target does not trace data.  As a
convenience, when replaying, <small>GDB</small> reads read-only memory off

disassemble code while replaying, but not to print variables.
In some cases, being able to inspect variables might be useful.
You can use the following command for that:
</p>
</dd>

<dd><p>Control the behavior of the <code>btrace</code> recording method when

and to read-write memory.  Beware that the accessed memory corresponds
to the live target and not necessarily to the current replay
position.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set record btrace cpu <var>identifier</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set the processor to be used for enabling workarounds for processor
errata when decoding the trace.
</p>
<p>Processor errata are defects in processor operation, caused by its
design or manufacture.  They can cause a trace not to match the
specification.  This, in turn, may cause trace decode to fail.
<small>GDB</small> can detect erroneous trace packets and correct them, thus
avoiding the decoding failures.  These corrections are known as
<em>errata workarounds</em>, and are enabled based on the processor on
which the trace was recorded.
</p>
<p>By default, <small>GDB</small> attempts to detect the processor
automatically, and apply the necessary workarounds for it.  However,
you may need to specify the processor if <small>GDB</small> does not yet
support it.  This command allows you to do that, and also allows to
disable the workarounds.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>identifier</var> identifies the <small>CPU</small> and is of the
form: <code><var>vendor</var>:<var>processor identifier</var></code>.  In addition,
there are two special identifiers, <code>none</code> and <code>auto</code>
(default).
</p>
<p>The following vendor identifiers and corresponding processor
identifiers are currently supported:
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><code>intel</code></td><td><var>family</var>/<var>model</var>[/<var>stepping</var>]</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>On GNU/Linux systems, the processor <var>family</var>, <var>model</var>, and
<var>stepping</var> can be obtained from <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>.
</p>
<p>If <var>identifier</var> is <code>auto</code>, enable errata workarounds for the
processor on which the trace was recorded.  If <var>identifier</var> is
<code>none</code>, errata workarounds are disabled.
</p>
<p>For example, when using an old <small>GDB</small> on a new system, decode
may fail because <small>GDB</small> does not support the new processor.  It
often suffices to specify an older processor that <small>GDB</small>
supports.

<a name="Stack"></a>

<a name="Examining-the-Stack"></a>
<h2>8 Examining the Stack</h2>

<p>When your program has stopped, the first thing you need to know is where it
stopped and how it got there.
</p>
<a name="index-call-stack"></a>
<p>Each time your program performs a function call, information about the call
is generated.
That information includes the location of the call in your program,
the arguments of the call,
and the local variables of the function being called.
The information is saved in a block of data called a <em>stack frame</em>.
The stack frames are allocated in a region of memory called the <em>call
stack</em>.
</p>
<p>When your program stops, the <small>GDB</small> commands for examining the
stack allow you to see all of this information.
</p>
<a name="index-selected-frame"></a>
<p>One of the stack frames is <em>selected</em> by <small>GDB</small> and many
<small>GDB</small> commands refer implicitly to the selected frame.  In
particular, whenever you ask <small>GDB</small> for the value of a variable in
your program, the value is found in the selected frame.  There are
special <small>GDB</small> commands to select whichever frame you are
interested in.  See <a href="#Selection">Selecting a Frame</a>.
</p>
<p>When your program stops, <small>GDB</small> automatically selects the
currently executing frame and describes it briefly, similar to the
<code>frame</code> command (see <a href="#Frame-Info">Information about a Frame</a>).
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Frames"></a>

<a name="Stack-Frames"></a>
<h3>8.1 Stack Frames</h3>

<a name="index-frame_002c-definition"></a>
<a name="index-stack-frame"></a>
<p>The call stack is divided up into contiguous pieces called <em>stack
frames</em>, or <em>frames</em> for short; each frame is the data associated
with one call to one function.  The frame contains the arguments given
to the function, the function’s local variables, and the address at
which the function is executing.
</p>
<a name="index-initial-frame"></a>
<a name="index-outermost-frame"></a>
<a name="index-innermost-frame"></a>
<p>When your program is started, the stack has only one frame, that of the
function <code>main</code>.  This is called the <em>initial</em> frame or the
<em>outermost</em> frame.  Each time a function is called, a new frame is
made.  Each time a function returns, the frame for that function invocation
is eliminated.  If a function is recursive, there can be many frames for
the same function.  The frame for the function in which execution is
actually occurring is called the <em>innermost</em> frame.  This is the most
recently created of all the stack frames that still exist.
</p>
<a name="index-frame-pointer"></a>
<p>Inside your program, stack frames are identified by their addresses.  A
stack frame consists of many bytes, each of which has its own address; each
kind of computer has a convention for choosing one byte whose
address serves as the address of the frame.  Usually this address is kept
in a register called the <em>frame pointer register</em>
(see <a href="#Registers">$fp</a>) while execution is going on in that frame.
</p>
<a name="index-frame-level"></a>
<a name="index-frame-number"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> labels each existing stack frame with a <em>level</em>, a
number that is zero for the innermost frame, one for the frame that
called it, and so on upward.  These level numbers give you a way of
designating stack frames in <small>GDB</small> commands.  The terms
<em>frame number</em> and <em>frame level</em> can be used interchangeably to
describe this number.
</p>
<a name="index-frameless-execution"></a>
<p>Some compilers provide a way to compile functions so that they operate
without stack frames.  (For example, the <small>GCC</small> option
</p><div>
<pre>‘<samp>-fomit-frame-pointer</samp>’
</pre></div>
<p>generates functions without a frame.)
This is occasionally done with heavily used library functions to save
the frame setup time.  <small>GDB</small> has limited facilities for dealing
with these function invocations.  If the innermost function invocation
has no stack frame, <small>GDB</small> nevertheless regards it as though
it had a separate frame, which is numbered zero as usual, allowing
correct tracing of the function call chain.  However, <small>GDB</small> has
no provision for frameless functions elsewhere in the stack.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Backtrace"></a>

<a name="Backtraces"></a>
<h3>8.2 Backtraces</h3>

<a name="index-traceback"></a>
<a name="index-call-stack-traces"></a>
<p>A backtrace is a summary of how your program got where it is.  It shows one
line per frame, for many frames, starting with the currently executing
frame (frame zero), followed by its caller (frame one), and on up the

<p>To print a backtrace of the entire stack, use the <code>backtrace</code>
command, or its alias <code>bt</code>.  This command will print one line per
frame for frames in the stack.  By default, all stack frames are
printed.  You can stop the backtrace at any time by typing the system
interrupt character, normally <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd>.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>backtrace [<var>option</var>]… [<var>qualifier</var>]… [<var>count</var>]</code></dt>
<dt><code>bt [<var>option</var>]… [<var>qualifier</var>]… [<var>count</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the backtrace of the entire stack.
</p>
<p>The optional <var>count</var> can be one of the following:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code><var>n</var></code></dt>
<dt><code><var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Print only the innermost <var>n</var> frames, where <var>n</var> is a positive

<a name="index-where"></a>
<a name="index-info-stack"></a>
<p>The names <code>where</code> and <code>info stack</code> (abbreviated <code>info s</code>)
are additional aliases for <code>backtrace</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-multiple-threads_002c-backtrace"></a>
<p>In a multi-threaded program, <small>GDB</small> by default shows the
backtrace only for the current thread.  To display the backtrace for
several or all of the threads, use the command <code>thread apply</code>
(see <a href="#Threads">thread apply</a>).  For example, if you type <kbd>thread
apply all backtrace</kbd>, <small>GDB</small> will display the backtrace for all
the threads; this is handy when you debug a core dump of a
multi-threaded program.
</p>
<p>Each line in the backtrace shows the frame number and the function name.
The program counter value is also shown—unless you use <code>set
print address off</code>.  The backtrace also shows the source file name and
line number, as well as the arguments to the function.  The program
counter value is omitted if it is at the beginning of the code for that
line number.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of a backtrace.  It was made with the command
‘<samp>bt 3</samp>’, so it shows the innermost three frames.
</p>
<div>
<pre>#0  m4_traceon (obs=0x24eb0, argc=1, argv=0x2b8c8)
    at builtin.c:993
#1  0x6e38 in expand_macro (sym=0x2b600, data=...) at macro.c:242
#2  0x6840 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=177664, td=0xf7fffb08)
    at macro.c:71
(More stack frames follow...)
</pre></div>

<p>The display for frame zero does not begin with a program counter
value, indicating that your program has stopped at the beginning of the
code for line <code>993</code> of <code>builtin.c</code>.
</p>
<p>The value of parameter <code>data</code> in frame 1 has been replaced by
<code>…</code>.  By default, <small>GDB</small> prints the value of a parameter
only if it is a scalar (integer, pointer, enumeration, etc).  See command
<kbd>set print frame-arguments</kbd> in <a href="#Print-Settings">Print Settings</a> for more details
on how to configure the way function parameter values are printed.
The command <kbd>set print frame-info</kbd> (see <a href="#Print-Settings">Print Settings</a>) controls
what frame information is printed.
</p>
<a name="index-optimized-out_002c-in-backtrace"></a>
<a name="index-function-call-arguments_002c-optimized-out"></a>
<p>If your program was compiled with optimizations, some compilers will
optimize away arguments passed to functions if those arguments are
never used after the call.  Such optimizations generate code that
passes arguments through registers, but doesn’t store those arguments
in the stack frame.  <small>GDB</small> has no way of displaying such
arguments in stack frames other than the innermost one.  Here’s what
such a backtrace might look like:
</p>
<div>
<pre>#0  m4_traceon (obs=0x24eb0, argc=1, argv=0x2b8c8)
    at builtin.c:993
#1  0x6e38 in expand_macro (sym=&lt;optimized out&gt;) at macro.c:242
#2  0x6840 in expand_token (obs=0x0, t=&lt;optimized out&gt;, td=0xf7fffb08)
    at macro.c:71
(More stack frames follow...)
</pre></div>

<p>The values of arguments that were not saved in their stack frames are
shown as ‘<samp>&lt;optimized out&gt;</samp>’.
</p>
<p>If you need to display the values of such optimized-out arguments,
either deduce that from other variables whose values depend on the one
you are interested in, or recompile without optimizations.
</p>
<a name="index-backtrace-beyond-main-function"></a>
<a name="index-program-entry-point"></a>
<a name="index-startup-code_002c-and-backtrace"></a>
<p>Most programs have a standard user entry point—a place where system
libraries and startup code transition into user code.  For C this is
<code>main</code><a name="DOCF9" href="#FOOT9"><sup>9</sup></a>.
When <small>GDB</small> finds the entry function in a backtrace
it will terminate the backtrace, to avoid tracing into highly
system-specific (and generally uninteresting) code.
</p>
<p>If you need to examine the startup code, or limit the number of levels
in a backtrace, you can change this behavior:
</p>

<h3>8.3 Selecting a Frame</h3>

<p>Most commands for examining the stack and other data in your program work on
whichever stack frame is selected at the moment.  Here are the commands for
selecting a stack frame; all of them finish by printing a brief description
of the stack frame just selected.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-frame_002c-selecting"></a>
<a name="index-f-_0028frame_0029"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>frame <span>[</span> <var>frame-selection-spec</var> <span>]</span></code></dt>
<dt><code>f <span>[</span> <var>frame-selection-spec</var> <span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>frame</code> command allows different stack frames to be
selected.  The <var>frame-selection-spec</var> can be any of the following:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-frame-level-1"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>num</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>level <var>num</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Select frame level <var>num</var>.  Recall that frame zero is the innermost
(currently executing) frame, frame one is the frame that called the
innermost one, and so on.  The highest level frame is usually the one
for <code>main</code>.
</p>
<p>As this is the most common method of navigating the frame stack, the
string <code>level</code> can be omitted.  For example, the following two
commands are equivalent:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) frame 3
(gdb) frame level 3
</pre></div>

<a name="index-frame-address"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>address <var>stack-address</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Select the frame with stack address <var>stack-address</var>.  The
<var>stack-address</var> for a frame can be seen in the output of
<code>info frame</code>, for example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) info frame
Stack level 1, frame at 0x7fffffffda30:
 rip = 0x40066d in b (amd64-entry-value.cc:59); saved rip 0x4004c5
 tail call frame, caller of frame at 0x7fffffffda30
 source language c++.
 Arglist at unknown address.
 Locals at unknown address, Previous frame&#39;s sp is 0x7fffffffda30
</pre></div>

<p>The <var>stack-address</var> for this frame is <code>0x7fffffffda30</code> as
indicated by the line:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Stack level 1, frame at 0x7fffffffda30:
</pre></div>

<a name="index-frame-function"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>function <var>function-name</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Select the stack frame for function <var>function-name</var>.  If there are
multiple stack frames for function <var>function-name</var> then the inner
most stack frame is selected.
</p>
<a name="index-frame-view"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>view <var>stack-address</var> <span>[</span> <var>pc-addr</var> <span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>View a frame that is not part of <small>GDB</small>’s backtrace.  The frame
viewed has stack address <var>stack-addr</var>, and optionally, a program
counter address of <var>pc-addr</var>.
</p>
<p>This is useful mainly if the chaining of stack frames has been
damaged by a bug, making it impossible for <small>GDB</small> to assign
numbers properly to all frames.  In addition, this can be useful
when your program has multiple stacks and switches between them.
</p>
<p>When viewing a frame outside the current backtrace using
<code>frame view</code> then you can always return to the original
stack using one of the previous stack frame selection instructions,
for example <code>frame level 0</code>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-up"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>up <var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Move <var>n</var> frames up the stack; <var>n</var> defaults to 1.  For positive
numbers <var>n</var>, this advances toward the outermost frame, to higher
frame numbers, to frames that have existed longer.
</p>
<a name="index-down"></a>
<a name="index-do-_0028down_0029"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>down <var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Move <var>n</var> frames down the stack; <var>n</var> defaults to 1.  For
positive numbers <var>n</var>, this advances toward the innermost frame, to
lower frame numbers, to frames that were created more recently.
You may abbreviate <code>down</code> as <code>do</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>All of these commands end by printing two lines of output describing the
frame.  The first line shows the frame number, the function name, the
arguments, and the source file and line number of execution in that
frame.  The second line shows the text of that source line.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) up
#1  0x22f0 in main (argc=1, argv=0xf7fffbf4, env=0xf7fffbfc)
    at env.c:10
10              read_input_file (argv[i]);
</pre></div>

<p>After such a printout, the <code>list</code> command with no arguments
prints ten lines centered on the point of execution in the frame.
You can also edit the program at the point of execution with your favorite
editing program by typing <code>edit</code>.
See <a href="#List">Printing Source Lines</a>,
for details.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-select_002dframe"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>select-frame <span>[</span> <var>frame-selection-spec</var> <span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>select-frame</code> command is a variant of <code>frame</code> that does
not display the new frame after selecting it.  This command is
intended primarily for use in <small>GDB</small> command scripts, where the
output might be unnecessary and distracting.  The
<var>frame-selection-spec</var> is as for the <code>frame</code> command

<dd><p>When used without any argument, this command does not change which

</p>
<a name="index-info-frame"></a>
<a name="index-info-f-_0028info-frame_0029"></a>

<dt><code>info f</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command prints a verbose description of the selected stack frame,
including:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the address of the frame
</li><li> the address of the next frame down (called by this frame)
</li><li> the address of the next frame up (caller of this frame)
</li><li> the language in which the source code corresponding to this frame is written
</li><li> the address of the frame’s arguments
</li><li> the address of the frame’s local variables
</li><li> the program counter saved in it (the address of execution in the caller frame)
</li><li> which registers were saved in the frame
</li></ul>

<p>The verbose description is useful when
something has gone wrong that has made the stack format fail to fit
the usual conventions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>info frame <span>[</span> <var>frame-selection-spec</var> <span>]</span></code></dt>
<dt><code>info f <span>[</span> <var>frame-selection-spec</var> <span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Print a verbose description of the frame selected by
<var>frame-selection-spec</var>.  The <var>frame-selection-spec</var> is the
same as for the <code>frame</code> command (see <a href="#Selection">Selecting

</p>
<a name="index-info-args"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>info args [-q]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the arguments of the selected frame, each on a separate line.

<p>If <var>type_regexp</var> is provided, print only the arguments whose
types, as printed by the <code>whatis</code> command, match
the regular expression <var>type_regexp</var>.
If <var>type_regexp</var> contains space(s), it should be enclosed in
quote characters.  If needed, use backslash to escape the meaning
of special characters or quotes.
</p>
<p>If both <var>regexp</var> and <var>type_regexp</var> are provided, an argument
is printed only if its name matches <var>regexp</var> and its type matches
<var>type_regexp</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>info locals [-q]</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-info-locals"></a>
<p>Print the local variables of the selected frame, each on a separate
line.  These are all variables (declared either static or automatic)
accessible at the point of execution of the selected frame.

</p>
<p>The command <kbd>info locals -q -t <var>type_regexp</var></kbd> can usefully be
combined with the commands <kbd>frame apply</kbd> and <kbd>thread apply</kbd>.
For example, your program might use Resource Acquisition Is
Initialization types (RAII) such as <code>lock_something_t</code>: each
local variable of type <code>lock_something_t</code> automatically places a
lock that is destroyed when the variable goes out of scope.  You can
then list all acquired locks in your program by doing
</p><div>
<pre>thread apply all -s frame apply all -s info locals -q -t lock_something_t
</pre></div>
<p>or the equivalent shorter form
</p><div>
<pre>tfaas i lo -q -t lock_something_t
</pre></div>

</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-past-main [<code>on</code>|<code>off</code>]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Whether backtraces should continue past <code>main</code>.
Related setting: <a href="#set-backtrace-past_002dmain">set backtrace past-main</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-past-entry [<code>on</code>|<code>off</code>]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Whether backtraces should continue past the entry point of a program.
Related setting: <a href="#set-backtrace-past_002dentry">set backtrace past-entry</a>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>By default, <small>GDB</small> displays some frame information before the
output produced by <var>command</var>, and an error raised during the
execution of a <var>command</var> will abort <code>frame apply</code>.  The
following options can be used to fine-tune these behaviors:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-c</code></dt>
<dd><p>The flag <code>-c</code>, which stands for ‘<samp>continue</samp>’, causes any
errors in <var>command</var> to be displayed, and the execution of
<code>frame apply</code> then continues.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>-s</code></dt>
<dd><p>The flag <code>-s</code>, which stands for ‘<samp>silent</samp>’, causes any errors
or empty output produced by a <var>command</var> to be silently ignored.
That is, the execution continues, but the frame information and errors
are not printed.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>-q</code></dt>
<dd><p>The flag <code>-q</code> (‘<samp>quiet</samp>’) disables printing the frame
information.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The following example shows how the flags <code>-c</code> and <code>-s</code> are
working when applying the command <code>p j</code> to all frames, where
variable <code>j</code> can only be successfully printed in the outermost
<code>#1 main</code> frame.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) frame apply all p j
#0  some_function (i=5) at fun.c:4
No symbol &#34;j&#34; in current context.
(gdb) frame apply all -c p j
#0  some_function (i=5) at fun.c:4
No symbol &#34;j&#34; in current context.
#1  0x565555fb in main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd2c4) at fun.c:11
$1 = 5
(gdb) frame apply all -s p j
#1  0x565555fb in main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd2c4) at fun.c:11
$2 = 5
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>By default, ‘<samp>frame apply</samp>’, prints the frame location
information before the command output:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) frame apply all p $sp
#0  some_function (i=5) at fun.c:4
$4 = (void *) 0xffffd1e0
#1  0x565555fb in main (argc=1, argv=0xffffd2c4) at fun.c:11
$5 = (void *) 0xffffd1f0
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>If the flag <code>-q</code> is given, no frame information is printed:
</p><div>
<pre>(gdb) frame apply all -q p $sp
$12 = (void *) 0xffffd1e0
$13 = (void *) 0xffffd1f0
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<h2>9 Examining Source Files</h2>

<p><small>GDB</small> can print parts of your program’s source, since the debugging
information recorded in the program tells <small>GDB</small> what source files were
used to build it.  When your program stops, <small>GDB</small> spontaneously prints
the line where it stopped.  Likewise, when you select a stack frame
(see <a href="#Selection">Selecting a Frame</a>), <small>GDB</small> prints the line where
execution in that frame has stopped.  You can print other portions of
source files by explicit command.
</p>
<p>If you use <small>GDB</small> through its <small>GNU</small> Emacs interface, you may
prefer to use Emacs facilities to view source; see <a href="#Emacs">Using
<small>GDB</small> under <small>GNU</small> Emacs</a>.
</p>

<a name="List"></a>

<a name="Printing-Source-Lines"></a>
<h3>9.1 Printing Source Lines</h3>

<a name="index-list"></a>
<a name="index-l-_0028list_0029"></a>
<p>To print lines from a source file, use the <code>list</code> command
(abbreviated <code>l</code>).  By default, ten lines are printed.
There are several ways to specify what part of the file you want to
print; see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>, for the full list.
</p>
<p>Here are the forms of the <code>list</code> command most commonly used:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>list <var>linenum</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Print lines centered around line number <var>linenum</var> in the
current source file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>list <var>function</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Print lines centered around the beginning of function
<var>function</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>list</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print more lines.  If the last lines printed were printed with a
<code>list</code> command, this prints lines following the last lines
printed; however, if the last line printed was a solitary line printed
as part of displaying a stack frame (see <a href="#Stack">Examining the
Stack</a>), this prints lines centered around that line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>list -</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print lines just before the lines last printed.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-list_002c-how-many-lines-to-display"></a>
<p>By default, <small>GDB</small> prints ten source lines with any of these forms of
the <code>list</code> command.  You can change this using <code>set listsize</code>:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-listsize"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set listsize <var>count</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>set listsize unlimited</code></dt>
<dd><p>Make the <code>list</code> command display <var>count</var> source lines (unless
the <code>list</code> argument explicitly specifies some other number).
Setting <var>count</var> to <code>unlimited</code> or 0 means there’s no limit.
</p>
<a name="index-show-listsize"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>show listsize</code></dt>
<dd><p>Display the number of lines that <code>list</code> prints.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Repeating a <code>list</code> command with <tt>RET</tt> discards the argument,
so it is equivalent to typing just <code>list</code>.  This is more useful
than listing the same lines again.  An exception is made for an
argument of ‘<samp>-</samp>’; that argument is preserved in repetition so that
each repetition moves up in the source file.
</p>
<p>In general, the <code>list</code> command expects you to supply zero, one or two
<em>locations</em>.  Locations specify source lines; there are several ways
of writing them (see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>), but the effect is always
to specify some source line.
</p>
<p>Here is a complete description of the possible arguments for <code>list</code>:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>list <var>location</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Print lines centered around the line specified by <var>location</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>list <var>first</var>,<var>last</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Print lines from <var>first</var> to <var>last</var>.  Both arguments are
locations.  When a <code>list</code> command has two locations, and the
source file of the second location is omitted, this refers to
the same source file as the first location.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>list ,<var>last</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Print lines ending with <var>last</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>list <var>first</var>,</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print lines starting with <var>first</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>list +</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print lines just after the lines last printed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>list -</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print lines just before the lines last printed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>list</code></dt>
<dd><p>As described in the preceding table.

<h3>9.2 Specifying a Location</h3>
<a name="index-specifying-location"></a>
<a name="index-location"></a>
<a name="index-source-location"></a>

<p>Several <small>GDB</small> commands accept arguments that specify a location
of your program’s code.  Since <small>GDB</small> is a source-level
debugger, a location usually specifies some line in the source code.
Locations may be specified using three different formats:
linespec locations, explicit locations, or address locations.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Linespec-Locations"></a>

<a name="Linespec-Locations-1"></a>
<h4>9.2.1 Linespec Locations</h4>
<a name="index-linespec-locations"></a>

<p>A <em>linespec</em> is a colon-separated list of source location parameters such
as file name, function name, etc.  Here are all the different ways of
specifying a linespec:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code><var>linenum</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the line number <var>linenum</var> of the current source file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-<var>offset</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>+<var>offset</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the line <var>offset</var> lines before or after the <em>current
line</em>.  For the <code>list</code> command, the current line is the last one
printed; for the breakpoint commands, this is the line at which
execution stopped in the currently selected <em>stack frame</em>
(see <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>, for a description of stack frames.)  When
used as the second of the two linespecs in a <code>list</code> command,
this specifies the line <var>offset</var> lines up or down from the first
linespec.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>filename</var>:<var>linenum</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the line <var>linenum</var> in the source file <var>filename</var>.
If <var>filename</var> is a relative file name, then it will match any
source file name with the same trailing components.  For example, if
<var>filename</var> is ‘<samp>gcc/expr.c</samp>’, then it will match source file
name of <samp>/build/trunk/gcc/expr.c</samp>, but not
<samp>/build/trunk/libcpp/expr.c</samp> or <samp>/build/trunk/gcc/x-expr.c</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>function</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the line that begins the body of the function <var>function</var>.
For example, in C, this is the line with the open brace.
</p>
<p>By default, in C<tt>++</tt> and Ada, <var>function</var> is interpreted as
specifying all functions named <var>function</var> in all scopes.  For
C<tt>++</tt>, this means in all namespaces and classes.  For Ada, this
means in all packages.
</p>
<p>For example, assuming a program with C<tt>++</tt> symbols named
<code>A::B::func</code> and <code>B::func</code>, both commands <kbd>break func</kbd><!-- /@w --> and <kbd>break B::func</kbd><!-- /@w --> set a breakpoint on both symbols.
</p>
<p>Commands that accept a linespec let you override this with the
<code>-qualified</code> option.  For example, <kbd>break <span>-qualified</span> func</kbd><!-- /@w --> sets a breakpoint on a free-function named <code>func</code> ignoring
any C<tt>++</tt> class methods and namespace functions called <code>func</code>.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Explicit-Locations">Explicit Locations</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>function</var>:<var>label</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the line where <var>label</var> appears in <var>function</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>filename</var>:<var>function</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the line that begins the body of the function <var>function</var>
in the file <var>filename</var>.  You only need the file name with a
function name to avoid ambiguity when there are identically named
functions in different source files.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>label</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the line at which the label named <var>label</var> appears
in the function corresponding to the currently selected stack frame.
If there is no current selected stack frame (for instance, if the inferior
is not running), then <small>GDB</small> will not search for a label.
</p>
<a name="index-breakpoint-at-static-probe-point"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-pstap|-probe-stap <span>[</span><var>objfile</var>:<span>[</span><var>provider</var>:<span>]</span><span>]</span><var>name</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The <small>GNU</small>/Linux tool <code>SystemTap</code> provides a way for
applications to embed static probes.  See <a href="#Static-Probe-Points">Static Probe Points</a>, for more
information on finding and using static probes.  This form of linespec
specifies the location of such a static probe.
</p>
<p>If <var>objfile</var> is given, only probes coming from that shared library
or executable matching <var>objfile</var> as a regular expression are considered.
If <var>provider</var> is given, then only probes from that provider are considered.
If several probes match the spec, <small>GDB</small> will insert a breakpoint at
each one of those probes.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="Explicit-Locations"></a>

<a name="Explicit-Locations-1"></a>
<h4>9.2.2 Explicit Locations</h4>
<a name="index-explicit-locations"></a>

<p><em>Explicit locations</em> allow the user to directly specify the source
location’s parameters using option-value pairs.
</p>
<p>Explicit locations are useful when several functions, labels, or
file names have the same name (base name for files) in the program’s
sources.  In these cases, explicit locations point to the source
line you meant more accurately and unambiguously.  Also, using
explicit locations might be faster in large programs.
</p>
<p>For example, the linespec ‘<samp>foo:bar</samp>’ may refer to a function <code>bar</code>
defined in the file named <samp>foo</samp> or the label <code>bar</code> in a function
named <code>foo</code>.  <small>GDB</small> must search either the file system or
the symbol table to know.
</p>
<p>The list of valid explicit location options is summarized in the
following table:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-source <var>filename</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The value specifies the source file name.  To differentiate between
files with the same base name, prepend as many directories as is necessary
to uniquely identify the desired file, e.g., <samp>foo/bar/baz.c</samp>.  Otherwise
<small>GDB</small> will use the first file it finds with the given base
name.   This option requires the use of either <code>-function</code> or <code>-line</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-function <var>function</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The value specifies the name of a function.  Operations
on function locations unmodified by other options (such as <code>-label</code>
or <code>-line</code>) refer to the line that begins the body of the function.
In C, for example, this is the line with the open brace.
</p>
<p>By default, in C<tt>++</tt> and Ada, <var>function</var> is interpreted as
specifying all functions named <var>function</var> in all scopes.  For
C<tt>++</tt>, this means in all namespaces and classes.  For Ada, this
means in all packages.
</p>
<p>For example, assuming a program with C<tt>++</tt> symbols named
<code>A::B::func</code> and <code>B::func</code>, both commands <kbd>break <span>-function</span> func</kbd><!-- /@w --> and <kbd>break <span>-function</span> B::func</kbd><!-- /@w --> set a
breakpoint on both symbols.
</p>
<p>You can use the <kbd>-qualified</kbd> flag to override this (see below).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-qualified</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>This flag makes <small>GDB</small> interpret a function name specified with
<kbd>-function</kbd> as a complete fully-qualified name.
</p>
<p>For example, assuming a C<tt>++</tt> program with symbols named
<code>A::B::func</code> and <code>B::func</code>, the <kbd>break <span>-qualified</span> <span>-function</span> B::func</kbd><!-- /@w --> command sets a breakpoint on <code>B::func</code>, only.
</p>
<p>(Note: the <kbd>-qualified</kbd> option can precede a linespec as well
(see <a href="#Linespec-Locations">Linespec Locations</a>), so the particular example above could be
simplified as <kbd>break <span>-qualified</span> B::func</kbd><!-- /@w -->.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-label <var>label</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The value specifies the name of a label.  When the function
name is not specified, the label is searched in the function of the currently
selected stack frame.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-line <var>number</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The value specifies a line offset for the location.  The offset may either
be absolute (<code>-line 3</code>) or relative (<code>-line +3</code>), depending on
the command.  When specified without any other options, the line offset is
relative to the current line.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Explicit location options may be abbreviated by omitting any non-unique
trailing characters from the option name, e.g., <kbd>break <span>-s</span> main.c <span>-li</span> 3</kbd><!-- /@w -->.
</p>

<a name="Address-Locations"></a>

<a name="Address-Locations-1"></a>
<h4>9.2.3 Address Locations</h4>
<a name="index-address-locations"></a>

<p><em>Address locations</em> indicate a specific program address.  They have
the generalized form *<var>address</var>.
</p>
<p>For line-oriented commands, such as <code>list</code> and <code>edit</code>, this
specifies a source line that contains <var>address</var>.  For <code>break</code> and
other breakpoint-oriented commands, this can be used to set breakpoints in
parts of your program which do not have debugging information or
source files.
</p>
<p>Here <var>address</var> may be any expression valid in the current working
language (see <a href="#Languages">working language</a>) that specifies a code
address.  In addition, as a convenience, <small>GDB</small> extends the
semantics of expressions used in locations to cover several situations
that frequently occur during debugging.  Here are the various forms
of <var>address</var>:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code><var>expression</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Any expression valid in the current working language.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>funcaddr</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>An address of a function or procedure derived from its name.  In C,
C<tt>++</tt>, Objective-C, Fortran, minimal, and assembly, this is
simply the function’s name <var>function</var> (and actually a special case
of a valid expression).  In Pascal and Modula-2, this is
<code>&amp;<var>function</var></code>.  In Ada, this is <code><var>function</var>&#39;Address</code>

<h3>9.3 Editing Source Files</h3>
<a name="index-editing-source-files"></a>

<a name="index-edit"></a>
<a name="index-e-_0028edit_0029"></a>
<p>To edit the lines in a source file, use the <code>edit</code> command.
The editing program of your choice
is invoked with the current line set to
the active line in the program.
Alternatively, there are several ways to specify what part of the file you
want to print if you want to see other parts of the program:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>edit <var>location</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Edit the source file specified by <code>location</code>.  Editing starts at
that <var>location</var>, e.g., at the specified source line of the
specified file.  See <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>, for all the possible forms
of the <var>location</var> argument; here are the forms of the <code>edit</code>
command most commonly used:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>edit <var>number</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Edit the current source file with <var>number</var> as the active line number.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>edit <var>function</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Edit the file containing <var>function</var> at the beginning of its definition.

<a name="Source-Path"></a>

<a name="Specifying-Source-Directories"></a>
<h3>9.5 Specifying Source Directories</h3>

<a name="index-source-path"></a>
<a name="index-directories-for-source-files"></a>
<p>Executable programs sometimes do not record the directories of the source
files from which they were compiled, just the names.  Even when they do,
the directories could be moved between the compilation and your debugging
session.  <small>GDB</small> has a list of directories to search for source files;
this is called the <em>source path</em>.  Each time <small>GDB</small> wants a source file,
it tries all the directories in the list, in the order they are present
in the list, until it finds a file with the desired name.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose an executable references the file
<samp>/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>, does not record a compilation
directory, and the <em>source path</em> is <samp>/mnt/cross</samp>.
<small>GDB</small> would look for the source file in the following
locations:
</p>
<ol>
<li> <samp>/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/mnt/cross/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/mnt/cross/foo.c</samp>

</li></ol>

<p>If the source file is not present at any of the above locations then
an error is printed.  <small>GDB</small> does not look up the parts of the
source file name, such as <samp>/mnt/cross/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>.
Likewise, the subdirectories of the source path are not searched: if
the source path is <samp>/mnt/cross</samp>, and the binary refers to
<samp>foo.c</samp>, <small>GDB</small> would not find it under
<samp>/mnt/cross/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib</samp>.
</p>
<p>Plain file names, relative file names with leading directories, file
names containing dots, etc. are all treated as described above,
except that non-absolute file names are not looked up literally.  If
the <em>source path</em> is <samp>/mnt/cross</samp>, the source file is
recorded as <samp>../lib/foo.c</samp>, and no compilation directory is
recorded, then <small>GDB</small> will search in the following locations:
</p>
<ol>
<li> <samp>/mnt/cross/../lib/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/mnt/cross/foo.c</samp>

</li></ol>

<a name="index-cdir"></a>
<a name="index-cwd"></a>
<a name="index-_0024cdir_002c-convenience-variable"></a>
<a name="index-_0024cwd_002c-convenience-variable"></a>
<a name="index-compilation-directory"></a>
<a name="index-current-directory"></a>
<a name="index-working-directory"></a>
<a name="index-directory_002c-current"></a>
<a name="index-directory_002c-compilation"></a>
<p>The <em>source path</em> will always include two special entries
‘<samp>$cdir</samp>’ and ‘<samp>$cwd</samp>’, these refer to the compilation directory
(if one is recorded) and the current working directory respectively.
</p>
<p>‘<samp>$cdir</samp>’ causes <small>GDB</small> to search within the compilation
directory, if one is recorded in the debug information.  If no
compilation directory is recorded in the debug information then
‘<samp>$cdir</samp>’ is ignored.
</p>
<p>‘<samp>$cwd</samp>’ is not the same as ‘<samp>.</samp>’—the former tracks the
current working directory as it changes during your <small>GDB</small>
session, while the latter is immediately expanded to the current
directory at the time you add an entry to the source path.
</p>
<p>If a compilation directory is recorded in the debug information, and
<small>GDB</small> has not found the source file after the first search
using <em>source path</em>, then <small>GDB</small> will combine the
compilation directory and the filename, and then search for the source
file again using the <em>source path</em>.
</p>
<p>For example, if the executable records the source file as
<samp>/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>, the compilation directory is
recorded as <samp>/project/build</samp>, and the <em>source path</em> is
<samp>/mnt/cross:$cdir:$cwd</samp> while the current working directory of
the <small>GDB</small> session is <samp>/home/user</samp>, then <small>GDB</small> will
search for the source file in the following locations:
</p>
<ol>
<li> <samp>/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/mnt/cross/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/project/build/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/home/user/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/mnt/cross/project/build/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/project/build/project/build/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/home/user/project/build/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/mnt/cross/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/project/build/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>/home/user/foo.c</samp>

</li></ol>

<p>If the file name in the previous example had been recorded in the
executable as a relative path rather than an absolute path, then the
first look up would not have occurred, but all of the remaining steps
would be similar.
</p>
<p>When searching for source files on MS-DOS and MS-Windows, where
absolute paths start with a drive letter (e.g.
<samp>C:/project/foo.c</samp>), <small>GDB</small> will remove the drive letter
from the file name before appending it to a search directory from
<em>source path</em>; for instance if the executable references the
source file <samp>C:/project/foo.c</samp> and <em>source path</em> is set to
<samp>D:/mnt/cross</samp>, then <small>GDB</small> will search in the following
locations for the source file:
</p>
<ol>
<li> <samp>C:/project/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>D:/mnt/cross/project/foo.c</samp>
</li><li> <samp>D:/mnt/cross/foo.c</samp>

</li></ol>

<p>Note that the executable search path is <em>not</em> used to locate the
source files.
</p>
<p>Whenever you reset or rearrange the source path, <small>GDB</small> clears out
any information it has cached about where source files are found and where
each line is in the file.
</p>
<a name="index-directory"></a>
<a name="index-dir"></a>
<p>When you start <small>GDB</small>, its source path includes only ‘<samp>$cdir</samp>’
and ‘<samp>$cwd</samp>’, in that order.
To add other directories, use the <code>directory</code> command.
</p>
<p>The search path is used to find both program source files and <small>GDB</small>
script files (read using the ‘<samp>-command</samp>’ option and ‘<samp>source</samp>’ command).
</p>
<p>In addition to the source path, <small>GDB</small> provides a set of commands
that manage a list of source path substitution rules.  A <em>substitution
rule</em> specifies how to rewrite source directories stored in the program’s
debug information in case the sources were moved to a different
directory between compilation and debugging.  A rule is made of
two strings, the first specifying what needs to be rewritten in
the path, and the second specifying how it should be rewritten.
In <a href="#set-substitute_002dpath">set substitute-path</a>, we name these two parts <var>from</var> and
<var>to</var> respectively.  <small>GDB</small> does a simple string replacement
of <var>from</var> with <var>to</var> at the start of the directory part of the
source file name, and uses that result instead of the original file
name to look up the sources.
</p>
<p>Using the previous example, suppose the <samp>foo-1.0</samp> tree has been
moved from <samp>/usr/src</samp> to <samp>/mnt/cross</samp>, then you can tell
<small>GDB</small> to replace <samp>/usr/src</samp> in all source path names with
<samp>/mnt/cross</samp>.  The first lookup will then be
<samp>/mnt/cross/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp> in place of the original location
of <samp>/usr/src/foo-1.0/lib/foo.c</samp>.  To define a source path
substitution rule, use the <code>set substitute-path</code> command
(see <a href="#set-substitute_002dpath">set substitute-path</a>).
</p>
<p>To avoid unexpected substitution results, a rule is applied only if the
<var>from</var> part of the directory name ends at a directory separator.
For instance, a rule substituting  <samp>/usr/source</samp> into
<samp>/mnt/cross</samp> will be applied to <samp>/usr/source/foo-1.0</samp> but
not to <samp>/usr/sourceware/foo-2.0</samp>.  And because the substitution
is applied only at the beginning of the directory name, this rule will
not be applied to <samp>/root/usr/source/baz.c</samp> either.
</p>
<p>In many cases, you can achieve the same result using the <code>directory</code>
command.  However, <code>set substitute-path</code> can be more efficient in
the case where the sources are organized in a complex tree with multiple
subdirectories.  With the <code>directory</code> command, you need to add each
subdirectory of your project.  If you moved the entire tree while
preserving its internal organization, then <code>set substitute-path</code>
allows you to direct the debugger to all the sources with one single
command.
</p>
<p><code>set substitute-path</code> is also more than just a shortcut command.
The source path is only used if the file at the original location no
longer exists.  On the other hand, <code>set substitute-path</code> modifies
the debugger behavior to look at the rewritten location instead.  So, if
for any reason a source file that is not relevant to your executable is
located at the original location, a substitution rule is the only
method available to point <small>GDB</small> at the new location.
</p>
<a name="index-_002d_002dwith_002drelocated_002dsources"></a>
<a name="index-default-source-path-substitution"></a>
<p>You can configure a default source path substitution rule by
configuring <small>GDB</small> with the
‘<samp>--with-relocated-sources=<var>dir</var></samp>’ option.  The <var>dir</var>
should be the name of a directory under <small>GDB</small>’s configured
prefix (set with ‘<samp>--prefix</samp>’ or ‘<samp>--exec-prefix</samp>’), and
directory names in debug information under <var>dir</var> will be adjusted
automatically if the installed <small>GDB</small> is moved to a new
location.  This is useful if <small>GDB</small>, libraries or executables
with debug information and corresponding source code are being moved
together.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>directory <var>dirname</var> …</code></dt>
<dt><code>dir <var>dirname</var> …</code></dt>
<dd><p>Add directory <var>dirname</var> to the front of the source path.  Several
directory names may be given to this command, separated by ‘<samp>:</samp>’
(‘<samp>;</samp>’ on MS-DOS and MS-Windows, where ‘<samp>:</samp>’ usually appears as
part of absolute file names) or
whitespace.  You may specify a directory that is already in the source
path; this moves it forward, so <small>GDB</small> searches it sooner.
</p>
<p>The special strings ‘<samp>$cdir</samp>’ (to refer to the compilation
directory, if one is recorded), and ‘<samp>$cwd</samp>’ (to refer to the
current working directory) can also be included in the list of
directories <var>dirname</var>.  Though these will already be in the source

<dt><code>set substitute-path <var>from</var> <var>to</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-substitute_002dpath"></a>
<p>Define a source path substitution rule, and add it at the end of the
current list of existing substitution rules.  If a rule with the same
<var>from</var> was already defined, then the old rule is also deleted.
</p>
<p>For example, if the file <samp>/foo/bar/baz.c</samp> was moved to
<samp>/mnt/cross/baz.c</samp>, then the command
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) set substitute-path /foo/bar /mnt/cross
</pre></div>

<p>will tell <small>GDB</small> to replace ‘<samp>/foo/bar</samp>’ with
‘<samp>/mnt/cross</samp>’, which will allow <small>GDB</small> to find the file
<samp>baz.c</samp> even though it was moved.
</p>
<p>In the case when more than one substitution rule have been defined,
the rules are evaluated one by one in the order where they have been
defined.  The first one matching, if any, is selected to perform
the substitution.
</p>
<p>For instance, if we had entered the following commands:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src/include /mnt/include
(gdb) set substitute-path /usr/src /mnt/src
</pre></div>

<p><small>GDB</small> would then rewrite <samp>/usr/src/include/defs.h</samp> into
<samp>/mnt/include/defs.h</samp> by using the first rule.  However, it would
use the second rule to rewrite <samp>/usr/src/lib/foo.c</samp> into
<samp>/mnt/src/lib/foo.c</samp>.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>unset substitute-path [path]</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-unset-substitute_002dpath"></a>
<p>If a path is specified, search the current list of substitution rules
for a rule that would rewrite that path.  Delete that rule if found.
A warning is emitted by the debugger if no rule could be found.
</p>
<p>If no path is specified, then all substitution rules are deleted.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show substitute-path [path]</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show-substitute_002dpath"></a>
<p>If a path is specified, then print the source path substitution rule
which would rewrite that path, if any.
</p>
<p>If no path is specified, then print all existing source path substitution
rules.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>If your source path is cluttered with directories that are no longer of
interest, <small>GDB</small> may sometimes cause confusion by finding the wrong
versions of source.  You can correct the situation as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Use <code>directory</code> with no argument to reset the source path to its default value.

</li><li> Use <code>directory</code> with suitable arguments to reinstall the
directories you want in the source path.  You can add all the
directories in one command.

The default memory range is the function surrounding the

<p>The <code>/m</code> option is deprecated as its output is not useful when
there is either inlined code or re-ordered code.
The <code>/s</code> option is the preferred choice.
Here is an example for AMD x86-64 showing the difference between
<code>/m</code> output and <code>/s</code> output.
This example has one inline function defined in a header file,
and the code is compiled with ‘<samp>-O2</samp>’ optimization.
Note how the <code>/m</code> output is missing the disassembly of
several instructions that are present in the <code>/s</code> output.

<p>Addresses cannot be specified as a location (see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>).
So, for example, if you want to disassemble function <code>bar</code>
in file <samp>foo.c</samp>, you must type ‘<samp>disassemble &#39;foo.c&#39;::bar</samp>’
and not ‘<samp>disassemble foo.c:bar</samp>’.
</p>
<p>Some architectures have more than one commonly-used set of instruction
mnemonics or other syntax.
</p>
<p>For programs that were dynamically linked and use shared libraries,
instructions that call functions or branch to locations in the shared

<p>The usual way to examine data in your program is with the <code>print</code>
command (abbreviated <code>p</code>), or its synonym <code>inspect</code>.  It
evaluates and prints the value of an expression of the language your
program is written in (see <a href="#Languages">Using <small>GDB</small> with

Python-based pretty-printer (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing">Pretty Printing</a>).

<dd><p><var>expr</var> is an expression (in the source language).  By default the
value of <var>expr</var> is printed in a format appropriate to its data type;

<p>Because the <code>print</code> command accepts arbitrary expressions which
may look like options (including abbreviations), if you specify any
command option, then you must use a double dash (<code>--</code>) to mark
the end of option processing.
</p>
<p>For example, this prints the value of the <code>-p</code> expression:
</p>


<p>While this repeats the last value in the value history (see below)
with the <code>-pretty</code> option in effect:
</p>


<p>Here is an example including both on option and an expression:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print -pretty -- *myptr
$1 = {
  next = 0x0,
  flags = {
    sweet = 1,
    sour = 1
  },
  meat = 0x54 &#34;Pork&#34;
}
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>print [<var>options</var>]</code></dt>
<dt><code>print [<var>options</var>] /<var>f</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-reprint-the-last-value"></a>
<p>If you omit <var>expr</var>, <small>GDB</small> displays the last value again (from the
<em>value history</em>; see <a href="#Value-History">Value History</a>).  This allows you to
conveniently inspect the same value in an alternative format.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If the architecture supports memory tagging, the <code>print</code> command will
display pointer/memory tag mismatches if what is being printed is a pointer
or reference type. See <a href="#Memory-Tagging">Memory Tagging</a>.
</p>
<p>A more low-level way of examining data is with the <code>x</code> command.
It examines data in memory at a specified address and prints it in a
specified format.  See <a href="#Memory">Examining Memory</a>.
</p>
<p>If you are interested in information about types, or about how the
fields of a struct or a class are declared, use the <code>ptype <var>exp</var></code>
command rather than <code>print</code>.  See <a href="#Symbols">Examining the Symbol
Table</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-exploring-hierarchical-data-structures"></a>
<a name="index-explore"></a>
<p>Another way of examining values of expressions and type information is
through the Python extension command <code>explore</code> (available only if
the <small>GDB</small> build is configured with <code>--with-python</code>).  It
offers an interactive way to start at the highest level (or, the most
abstract level) of the data type of an expression (or, the data type
itself) and explore all the way down to leaf scalar values/fields
embedded in the higher level data types.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>explore <var>arg</var></code></dt>
<dd><p><var>arg</var> is either an expression (in the source language), or a type
visible in the current context of the program being debugged.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The working of the <code>explore</code> command can be illustrated with an
example.  If a data type <code>struct ComplexStruct</code> is defined in your
C program as
</p>
<div>
<pre>struct SimpleStruct
{
  int i;
  double d;
};

struct ComplexStruct
{
  struct SimpleStruct *ss_p;
  int arr[10];
};
</pre></div>

<p>followed by variable declarations as
</p>
<div>
<pre>struct SimpleStruct ss = { 10, 1.11 };
struct ComplexStruct cs = { &amp;ss, { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 } };
</pre></div>

<p>then, the value of the variable <code>cs</code> can be explored using the
<code>explore</code> command as follows.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) explore cs
The value of `cs&#39; is a struct/class of type `struct ComplexStruct&#39; with
the following fields:

  ss_p = &lt;Enter 0 to explore this field of type `struct SimpleStruct *&#39;&gt;
   arr = &lt;Enter 1 to explore this field of type `int [10]&#39;&gt;

Enter the field number of choice:
</pre></div>

<p>Since the fields of <code>cs</code> are not scalar values, you are being
prompted to chose the field you want to explore.  Let’s say you choose
the field <code>ss_p</code> by entering <code>0</code>.  Then, since this field is a
pointer, you will be asked if it is pointing to a single value.  From
the declaration of <code>cs</code> above, it is indeed pointing to a single
value, hence you enter <code>y</code>.  If you enter <code>n</code>, then you will
be asked if it were pointing to an array of values, in which case this
field will be explored as if it were an array.
</p>
<div>
<pre>`cs.ss_p&#39; is a pointer to a value of type `struct SimpleStruct&#39;
Continue exploring it as a pointer to a single value [y/n]: y
The value of `*(cs.ss_p)&#39; is a struct/class of type `struct
SimpleStruct&#39; with the following fields:

  i = 10 .. (Value of type `int&#39;)
  d = 1.1100000000000001 .. (Value of type `double&#39;)

Press enter to return to parent value:
</pre></div>

<p>If the field <code>arr</code> of <code>cs</code> was chosen for exploration by
entering <code>1</code> earlier, then since it is as array, you will be
prompted to enter the index of the element in the array that you want
to explore.
</p>
<div>
<pre>`cs.arr&#39; is an array of `int&#39;.
Enter the index of the element you want to explore in `cs.arr&#39;: 5

`(cs.arr)[5]&#39; is a scalar value of type `int&#39;.

(cs.arr)[5] = 4

Press enter to return to parent value: 
</pre></div>

<p>In general, at any stage of exploration, you can go deeper towards the
leaf values by responding to the prompts appropriately, or hit the
return key to return to the enclosing data structure (the <i>higher</i>
level data structure).
</p>
<p>Similar to exploring values, you can use the <code>explore</code> command to
explore types.  Instead of specifying a value (which is typically a
variable name or an expression valid in the current context of the
program being debugged), you specify a type name.  If you consider the
same example as above, your can explore the type
<code>struct ComplexStruct</code> by passing the argument
<code>struct ComplexStruct</code> to the <code>explore</code> command.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) explore struct ComplexStruct
</pre></div>

<p>By responding to the prompts appropriately in the subsequent interactive
session, you can explore the type <code>struct ComplexStruct</code> in a
manner similar to how the value <code>cs</code> was explored in the above
example.
</p>
<p>The <code>explore</code> command also has two sub-commands,
<code>explore value</code> and <code>explore type</code>. The former sub-command is
a way to explicitly specify that value exploration of the argument is
being invoked, while the latter is a way to explicitly specify that type
exploration of the argument is being invoked.
</p>

<a name="Expressions"></a>

<a name="Expressions-1"></a>
<h3>10.1 Expressions</h3>

<a name="index-expressions"></a>
<p><code>print</code> and many other <small>GDB</small> commands accept an expression and
compute its value.  Any kind of constant, variable or operator defined
by the programming language you are using is valid in an expression in
<small>GDB</small>.  This includes conditional expressions, function calls,
casts, and string constants.  It also includes preprocessor macros, if
you compiled your program to include this information; see
<a href="#Compilation">Compilation</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-arrays-in-expressions"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> supports array constants in expressions input by
the user.  The syntax is {<var>element</var>, <var>element</var>…}.  For example,
you can use the command <code>print {1, 2, 3}</code> to create an array
of three integers.  If you pass an array to a function or assign it
to a program variable, <small>GDB</small> copies the array to memory that
is <code>malloc</code>ed in the target program.
</p>
<p>Because C is so widespread, most of the expressions shown in examples in
this manual are in C.  See <a href="#Languages">Using <small>GDB</small> with Different
Languages</a>, for information on how to use expressions in other
languages.
</p>
<p>In this section, we discuss operators that you can use in <small>GDB</small>
expressions regardless of your programming language.
</p>
<a name="index-casts_002c-in-expressions"></a>

<a name="Ambiguous-Expressions-1"></a>
<h3>10.2 Ambiguous Expressions</h3>
<a name="index-ambiguous-expressions"></a>

<p>Expressions can sometimes contain some ambiguous elements.  For instance,
some programming languages (notably Ada, C<tt>++</tt> and Objective-C) permit
a single function name to be defined several times, for application in
different contexts.  This is called <em>overloading</em>.  Another example
involving Ada is generics.  A <em>generic package</em> is similar to C<tt>++</tt>
templates and is typically instantiated several times, resulting in
the same function name being defined in different contexts.
</p>
<p>In some cases and depending on the language, it is possible to adjust
the expression to remove the ambiguity.  For instance in C<tt>++</tt>, you
can specify the signature of the function you want to break on, as in
<kbd>break <var>function</var>(<var>types</var>)</kbd>.  In Ada, using the fully
qualified name of your function often makes the expression unambiguous
as well.
</p>
<p>When an ambiguity that needs to be resolved is detected, the debugger
has the capability to display a menu of numbered choices for each
possibility, and then waits for the selection with the prompt ‘<samp>&gt;</samp>’.
The first option is always ‘<samp>[0] cancel</samp>’, and typing <kbd>0 <span>RET</span></kbd>
aborts the current command.  If the command in which the expression was
used allows more than one choice to be selected, the next option in the
menu is ‘<samp>[1] all</samp>’, and typing <kbd>1 <span>RET</span></kbd> selects all possible
choices.
</p>
<p>For example, the following session excerpt shows an attempt to set a
breakpoint at the overloaded symbol <code>String::after</code>.
We choose three particular definitions of that function name:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) b String::after
[0] cancel
[1] all
[2] file:String.cc; line number:867
[3] file:String.cc; line number:860
[4] file:String.cc; line number:875
[5] file:String.cc; line number:853
[6] file:String.cc; line number:846
[7] file:String.cc; line number:735
&gt; 2 4 6
Breakpoint 1 at 0xb26c: file String.cc, line 867.
Breakpoint 2 at 0xb344: file String.cc, line 875.
Breakpoint 3 at 0xafcc: file String.cc, line 846.
Multiple breakpoints were set.
Use the &#34;delete&#34; command to delete unwanted
 breakpoints.
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-multiple_002dsymbols"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set multiple-symbols <var>mode</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-multiple_002dsymbols-menu"></a>

<p>This option allows you to adjust the debugger behavior when an expression
is ambiguous.
</p>
<p>By default, <var>mode</var> is set to <code>all</code>.  If the command with which
the expression is used allows more than one choice, then <small>GDB</small>
automatically selects all possible choices.  For instance, inserting
a breakpoint on a function using an ambiguous name results in a breakpoint
inserted on each possible match.  However, if a unique choice must be made,
then <small>GDB</small> uses the menu to help you disambiguate the expression.
For instance, printing the address of an overloaded function will result
in the use of the menu.
</p>
<p>When <var>mode</var> is set to <code>ask</code>, the debugger always uses the menu
when an ambiguity is detected.
</p>
<p>Finally, when <var>mode</var> is set to <code>cancel</code>, the debugger reports
an error due to the ambiguity and the command is aborted.

<a name="Variables"></a>

<a name="Program-Variables"></a>
<h3>10.3 Program Variables</h3>

<p>The most common kind of expression to use is the name of a variable
in your program.
</p>
<p>Variables in expressions are understood in the selected stack frame
(see <a href="#Selection">Selecting a Frame</a>); they must be either:
</p>
<ul>
<li> global (or file-static)
</li></ul>

<p>or
</p>
<ul>
<li> visible according to the scope rules of the
programming language from the point of execution in that frame
</li></ul>

<p>This means that in the function
</p>
<div>
<pre>foo (a)
     int a;
{
  bar (a);
  {
    int b = test ();
    bar (b);
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>you can examine and use the variable <code>a</code> whenever your program is
executing within the function <code>foo</code>, but you can only use or
examine the variable <code>b</code> while your program is executing inside
the block where <code>b</code> is declared.
</p>
<a name="index-variable-name-conflict"></a>
<p>There is an exception: you can refer to a variable or function whose
scope is a single source file even if the current execution point is not
in this file.  But it is possible to have more than one such variable or
function with the same name (in different source files).  If that
happens, referring to that name has unpredictable effects.  If you wish,
you can specify a static variable in a particular function or file by
using the colon-colon (<code>::</code>) notation:
</p>
<a name="index-colon_002dcolon_002c-context-for-variables_002ffunctions"></a>
<a name="index-_003a_003a_002c-context-for-variables_002ffunctions"></a>
<div>
<pre><var>file</var>::<var>variable</var>
<var>function</var>::<var>variable</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Here <var>file</var> or <var>function</var> is the name of the context for the
static <var>variable</var>.  In the case of file names, you can use quotes to
make sure <small>GDB</small> parses the file name as a single word—for example,
to print a global value of <code>x</code> defined in <samp>f2.c</samp>:
</p>


<p>The <code>::</code> notation is normally used for referring to
static variables, since you typically disambiguate uses of local variables
in functions by selecting the appropriate frame and using the
simple name of the variable.  However, you may also use this notation
to refer to local variables in frames enclosing the selected frame:
</p>
<div>
<pre>void
foo (int a)
{
  if (a &lt; 10)
    bar (a);
  else
    process (a);    /* Stop here */
}

int
bar (int a)
{
  foo (a + 5);
}
</pre></div>

<p>For example, if there is a breakpoint at the commented line,
here is what you might see
when the program stops after executing the call <code>bar(0)</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) p a
$1 = 10
(gdb) p bar::a
$2 = 5
(gdb) up 2
#2  0x080483d0 in foo (a=5) at foobar.c:12
(gdb) p a
$3 = 5
(gdb) p bar::a
$4 = 0
</pre></div>

<a name="index-C_002b_002b-scope-resolution"></a>
<p>These uses of ‘<samp>::</samp>’ are very rarely in conflict with the very
similar use of the same notation in C<tt>++</tt>.  When they are in
conflict, the C<tt>++</tt> meaning takes precedence; however, this can be
overridden by quoting the file or function name with single quotes.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose the program is stopped in a method of a class
that has a field named <code>includefile</code>, and there is also an
include file named <samp>includefile</samp> that defines a variable,
<code>some_global</code>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) p includefile
$1 = 23
(gdb) p includefile::some_global
A syntax error in expression, near `&#39;.
(gdb) p &#39;includefile&#39;::some_global
$2 = 27
</pre></div>

<a name="index-wrong-values"></a>
<a name="index-variable-values_002c-wrong"></a>
<a name="index-function-entry_002fexit_002c-wrong-values-of-variables"></a>
<a name="index-optimized-code_002c-wrong-values-of-variables"></a>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Warning:</em> Occasionally, a local variable may appear to have the
wrong value at certain points in a function—just after entry to a new
scope, and just before exit.
</p></blockquote>
<p>You may see this problem when you are stepping by machine instructions.
This is because, on most machines, it takes more than one instruction to
set up a stack frame (including local variable definitions); if you are
stepping by machine instructions, variables may appear to have the wrong
values until the stack frame is completely built.  On exit, it usually
also takes more than one machine instruction to destroy a stack frame;
after you begin stepping through that group of instructions, local
variable definitions may be gone.
</p>
<p>This may also happen when the compiler does significant optimizations.
To be sure of always seeing accurate values, turn off all optimization
when compiling.
</p>
<a name="index-_0060_0060No-symbol-_0022foo_0022-in-current-context_0027_0027"></a>
<p>Another possible effect of compiler optimizations is to optimize
unused variables out of existence, or assign variables to registers (as
opposed to memory addresses).  Depending on the support for such cases
offered by the debug info format used by the compiler, <small>GDB</small>
might not be able to display values for such local variables.  If that
happens, <small>GDB</small> will print a message like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>No symbol &#34;foo&#34; in current context.
</pre></div>

<p>To solve such problems, either recompile without optimizations, or use a
different debug info format, if the compiler supports several such
formats.  See <a href="#Compilation">Compilation</a>, for more information on choosing compiler
options.  See <a href="#C">C and C<tt>++</tt></a>, for more information about debug
info formats that are best suited to C<tt>++</tt> programs.
</p>
<p>If you ask to print an object whose contents are unknown to
<small>GDB</small>, e.g., because its data type is not completely specified
by the debug information, <small>GDB</small> will say ‘<samp>&lt;incomplete
type&gt;</samp>’.  See <a href="#Symbols">incomplete type</a>, for more about this.
</p>
<a name="index-no-debug-info-variables"></a>
<p>If you try to examine or use the value of a (global) variable for
which <small>GDB</small> has no type information, e.g., because the program
includes no debug information, <small>GDB</small> displays an error message.
See <a href="#Symbols">unknown type</a>, for more about unknown types.  If you
cast the variable to its declared type, <small>GDB</small> gets the
variable’s value using the cast-to type as the variable’s type.  For
example, in a C program:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  (gdb) p var
  &#39;var&#39; has unknown type; cast it to its declared type
  (gdb) p (float) var
  $1 = 3.14
</pre></div>

<p>If you append <kbd>@entry</kbd> string to a function parameter name you get its
value at the time the function got called.  If the value is not available an
error message is printed.  Entry values are available only with some compilers.
Entry values are normally also printed at the function parameter list according
to <a href="#set-print-entry_002dvalues">set print entry-values</a>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>Breakpoint 1, d (i=30) at gdb.base/entry-value.c:29
29	  i++;
(gdb) next
30	  e (i);
(gdb) print i
$1 = 31
(gdb) print i@entry
$2 = 30
</pre></div>

<p>Strings are identified as arrays of <code>char</code> values without specified
signedness.  Arrays of either <code>signed char</code> or <code>unsigned char</code> get
printed as arrays of 1 byte sized integers.  <code>-fsigned-char</code> or
<code>-funsigned-char</code> <small>GCC</small> options have no effect as <small>GDB</small>
defines literal string type <code>&#34;char&#34;</code> as <code>char</code> without a sign.
For program code
</p>
<div>
<pre>char var0[] = &#34;A&#34;;
signed char var1[] = &#34;A&#34;;
</pre></div>

<p>You get during debugging
</p><div>
<pre>(gdb) print var0
$1 = &#34;A&#34;
(gdb) print var1
$2 = {65 &#39;A&#39;, 0 &#39;\0&#39;}

<h3>10.4 Artificial Arrays</h3>

<a name="index-artificial-array"></a>
<a name="index-arrays"></a>
<a name="index-_0040_002c-referencing-memory-as-an-array"></a>
<p>It is often useful to print out several successive objects of the
same type in memory; a section of an array, or an array of
dynamically determined size for which only a pointer exists in the
program.
</p>
<p>You can do this by referring to a contiguous span of memory as an
<em>artificial array</em>, using the binary operator ‘<samp>@</samp>’.  The left
operand of ‘<samp>@</samp>’ should be the first element of the desired array
and be an individual object.  The right operand should be the desired length
of the array.  The result is an array value whose elements are all of
the type of the left argument.  The first element is actually the left
argument; the second element comes from bytes of memory immediately
following those that hold the first element, and so on.  Here is an
example.  If a program says
</p>
<div>
<pre>int *array = (int *) malloc (len * sizeof (int));
</pre></div>

<p>you can print the contents of <code>array</code> with
</p>


<p>The left operand of ‘<samp>@</samp>’ must reside in memory.  Array values made
with ‘<samp>@</samp>’ in this way behave just like other arrays in terms of
subscripting, and are coerced to pointers when used in expressions.
Artificial arrays most often appear in expressions via the value history
(see <a href="#Value-History">Value History</a>), after printing one out.
</p>
<p>Another way to create an artificial array is to use a cast.
This re-interprets a value as if it were an array.
The value need not be in memory:
</p><div>
<pre>(gdb) p/x (short[2])0x12345678
$1 = {0x1234, 0x5678}
</pre></div>

<p>As a convenience, if you leave the array length out (as in
‘<samp>(<var>type</var>[])<var>value</var></samp>’) <small>GDB</small> calculates the size to fill
the value (as ‘<samp>sizeof(<var>value</var>)/sizeof(<var>type</var>)</samp>’:
</p><div>
<pre>(gdb) p/x (short[])0x12345678
$2 = {0x1234, 0x5678}
</pre></div>

<p>Sometimes the artificial array mechanism is not quite enough; in
moderately complex data structures, the elements of interest may not
actually be adjacent—for example, if you are interested in the values
of pointers in an array.  One useful work-around in this situation is
to use a convenience variable (see <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience
Variables</a>) as a counter in an expression that prints the first
interesting value, and then repeat that expression via <tt>RET</tt>.  For
instance, suppose you have an array <code>dtab</code> of pointers to
structures, and you are interested in the values of a field <code>fv</code>
in each structure.  Here is an example of what you might type:
</p>
<div>
<pre>set $i = 0
p dtab[$i++]-&gt;fv
<span>RET</span>
<span>RET</span>
…
</pre></div>

<a name="Output-Formats"></a>

<a name="Output-Formats-1"></a>
<h3>10.5 Output Formats</h3>

<a name="index-formatted-output"></a>
<a name="index-output-formats"></a>
<p>By default, <small>GDB</small> prints a value according to its data type.  Sometimes
this is not what you want.  For example, you might want to print a number
in hex, or a pointer in decimal.  Or you might want to view data in memory
at a certain address as a character string or as an instruction.  To do
these things, specify an <em>output format</em> when you print a value.
</p>
<p>The simplest use of output formats is to say how to print a value
already computed.  This is done by starting the arguments of the
<code>print</code> command with a slash and a format letter.  The format
letters supported are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>x</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the binary representation of the value in hexadecimal.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>d</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the binary representation of the value in decimal.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>u</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the binary representation of the value as an decimal, as if it
were unsigned.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>o</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the binary representation of the value in octal.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>t</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the binary representation of the value in binary.  The letter
‘<samp>t</samp>’ stands for “two”.  <a name="DOCF11" href="#FOOT11"><sup>11</sup></a>
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>a</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-unknown-address_002c-locating"></a>
<a name="index-locate-address"></a>
<p>Print as an address, both absolute in hexadecimal and as an offset from
the nearest preceding symbol.  You can use this format used to discover
where (in what function) an unknown address is located:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) p/a 0x54320
$3 = 0x54320 &lt;_initialize_vx+396&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The command <code>info symbol 0x54320</code> yields similar results.
See <a href="#Symbols">info symbol</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>c</code></dt>
<dd><p>Cast the value to an integer (unlike other formats, this does not just
reinterpret the underlying bits) and print it as a character constant.
This prints both the numerical value and its character representation.
The character representation is replaced with the octal escape
‘<samp>\nnn</samp>’ for characters outside the 7-bit <small>ASCII</small> range.
</p>
<p>Without this format, <small>GDB</small> displays <code>char</code>,
<code>unsigned char</code><!-- /@w -->, and <code>signed char</code><!-- /@w --> data as character
constants.  Single-byte members of vectors are displayed as integer
data.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>f</code></dt>
<dd><p>Regard the bits of the value as a floating point number and print
using typical floating point syntax.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>s</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-printing-strings"></a>
<a name="index-printing-byte-arrays"></a>
<p>Regard as a string, if possible.  With this format, pointers to single-byte
data are displayed as null-terminated strings and arrays of single-byte data
are displayed as fixed-length strings.  Other values are displayed in their
natural types.
</p>
<p>Without this format, <small>GDB</small> displays pointers to and arrays of
<code>char</code>, <code>unsigned char</code><!-- /@w -->, and <code>signed char</code><!-- /@w --> as
strings.  Single-byte members of a vector are displayed as an integer
array.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>z</code></dt>
<dd><p>Like ‘<samp>x</samp>’ formatting, the value is treated as an integer and
printed as hexadecimal, but leading zeros are printed to pad the value
to the size of the integer type.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>r</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-raw-printing"></a>
<p>Print using the ‘<samp>raw</samp>’ formatting.  By default, <small>GDB</small> will
use a Python-based pretty-printer, if one is available (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing">Pretty Printing</a>).  This typically results in a higher-level display of the
value’s contents.  The ‘<samp>r</samp>’ format bypasses any Python
pretty-printer which might exist.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, to print the program counter in hex (see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>), type
</p>


<p>Note that no space is required before the slash; this is because command
names in <small>GDB</small> cannot contain a slash.
</p>
<p>To reprint the last value in the value history with a different format,
you can use the <code>print</code> command with just a format and no
expression.  For example, ‘<samp>p/x</samp>’ reprints the last value in hex.
</p>

<a name="Memory"></a>

<a name="Examining-Memory"></a>
<h3>10.6 Examining Memory</h3>

<p>You can use the command <code>x</code> (for “examine”) to examine memory in
any of several formats, independently of your program’s data types.
</p>
<a name="index-examining-memory"></a>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-x-_0028examine-memory_0029"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>x/<var>nfu</var> <var>addr</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>x <var>addr</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>x</code></dt>
<dd><p>Use the <code>x</code> command to examine memory.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p><var>n</var>, <var>f</var>, and <var>u</var> are all optional parameters that specify how
much memory to display and how to format it; <var>addr</var> is an
expression giving the address where you want to start displaying memory.
If you use defaults for <var>nfu</var>, you need not type the slash ‘<samp>/</samp>’.
Several commands set convenient defaults for <var>addr</var>.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><var>n</var>, the repeat count</span></dt>
<dd><p>The repeat count is a decimal integer; the default is 1.  It specifies
how much memory (counting by units <var>u</var>) to display.  If a negative
number is specified, memory is examined backward from <var>addr</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><var>f</var>, the display format</span></dt>
<dd><p>The display format is one of the formats used by <code>print</code>
(‘<samp>x</samp>’, ‘<samp>d</samp>’, ‘<samp>u</samp>’, ‘<samp>o</samp>’, ‘<samp>t</samp>’, ‘<samp>a</samp>’, ‘<samp>c</samp>’,
‘<samp>f</samp>’, ‘<samp>s</samp>’), ‘<samp>i</samp>’ (for machine instructions) and
‘<samp>m</samp>’ (for displaying memory tags).
The default is ‘<samp>x</samp>’ (hexadecimal) initially.  The default changes
each time you use either <code>x</code> or <code>print</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><var>u</var>, the unit size</span></dt>
<dd><p>The unit size is any of
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>b</code></dt>
<dd><p>Bytes.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>h</code></dt>
<dd><p>Halfwords (two bytes).
</p></dd>
<dt><code>w</code></dt>
<dd><p>Words (four bytes).  This is the initial default.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>g</code></dt>
<dd><p>Giant words (eight bytes).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Each time you specify a unit size with <code>x</code>, that size becomes the
default unit the next time you use <code>x</code>.  For the ‘<samp>i</samp>’ format,
the unit size is ignored and is normally not written.  For the ‘<samp>s</samp>’ format,
the unit size defaults to ‘<samp>b</samp>’, unless it is explicitly given.
Use <kbd>x /hs</kbd> to display 16-bit char strings and <kbd>x /ws</kbd> to display
32-bit strings.  The next use of <kbd>x /s</kbd> will again display 8-bit strings.
Note that the results depend on the programming language of the
current compilation unit.  If the language is C, the ‘<samp>s</samp>’
modifier will use the UTF-16 encoding while ‘<samp>w</samp>’ will use
UTF-32.  The encoding is set by the programming language and cannot
be altered.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><var>addr</var>, starting display address</span></dt>
<dd><p><var>addr</var> is the address where you want <small>GDB</small> to begin displaying
memory.  The expression need not have a pointer value (though it may);
it is always interpreted as an integer address of a byte of memory.
See <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>, for more information on expressions.  The default for
<var>addr</var> is usually just after the last address examined—but several
other commands also set the default address: <code>info breakpoints</code> (to
the address of the last breakpoint listed), <code>info line</code> (to the
starting address of a line), and <code>print</code> (if you use it to display
a value from memory).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, ‘<samp>x/3uh 0x54320</samp>’ is a request to display three halfwords
(<code>h</code>) of memory, formatted as unsigned decimal integers (‘<samp>u</samp>’),
starting at address <code>0x54320</code>.  ‘<samp>x/4xw $sp</samp>’ prints the four
words (‘<samp>w</samp>’) of memory above the stack pointer (here, ‘<samp>$sp</samp>’;
see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>) in hexadecimal (‘<samp>x</samp>’).
</p>
<p>You can also specify a negative repeat count to examine memory backward
from the given address.  For example, ‘<samp>x/-3uh 0x54320</samp>’ prints three
halfwords (<code>h</code>) at <code>0x5431a</code>, <code>0x5431c</code>, and <code>0x5431e</code>.
</p>
<p>Since the letters indicating unit sizes are all distinct from the
letters specifying output formats, you do not have to remember whether
unit size or format comes first; either order works.  The output
specifications ‘<samp>4xw</samp>’ and ‘<samp>4wx</samp>’ mean exactly the same thing.
(However, the count <var>n</var> must come first; ‘<samp>wx4</samp>’ does not work.)
</p>
<p>Even though the unit size <var>u</var> is ignored for the formats ‘<samp>s</samp>’
and ‘<samp>i</samp>’, you might still want to use a count <var>n</var>; for example,
‘<samp>3i</samp>’ specifies that you want to see three machine instructions,
including any operands.  For convenience, especially when used with
the <code>display</code> command, the ‘<samp>i</samp>’ format also prints branch delay
slot instructions, if any, beyond the count specified, which immediately
follow the last instruction that is within the count.  The command
<code>disassemble</code> gives an alternative way of inspecting machine
instructions; see <a href="#Machine-Code">Source and Machine Code</a>.
</p>
<p>If a negative repeat count is specified for the formats ‘<samp>s</samp>’ or ‘<samp>i</samp>’,
the command displays null-terminated strings or instructions before the given
address as many as the absolute value of the given number.  For the ‘<samp>i</samp>’
format, we use line number information in the debug info to accurately locate
instruction boundaries while disassembling backward.  If line info is not
available, the command stops examining memory with an error message.
</p>
<p>All the defaults for the arguments to <code>x</code> are designed to make it
easy to continue scanning memory with minimal specifications each time
you use <code>x</code>.  For example, after you have inspected three machine
instructions with ‘<samp>x/3i <var>addr</var></samp>’, you can inspect the next seven
with just ‘<samp>x/7</samp>’.  If you use <tt>RET</tt> to repeat the <code>x</code> command,
the repeat count <var>n</var> is used again; the other arguments default as
for successive uses of <code>x</code>.
</p>
<p>When examining machine instructions, the instruction at current program
counter is shown with a <code>=&gt;</code> marker. For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) x/5i $pc-6
   0x804837f &lt;main+11&gt;: mov    %esp,%ebp
   0x8048381 &lt;main+13&gt;: push   %ecx
   0x8048382 &lt;main+14&gt;: sub    $0x4,%esp
=&gt; 0x8048385 &lt;main+17&gt;: movl   $0x8048460,(%esp)
   0x804838c &lt;main+24&gt;: call   0x80482d4 &lt;puts@plt&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>If the architecture supports memory tagging, the tags can be displayed by
using ‘<samp>m</samp>’.  See <a href="#Memory-Tagging">Memory Tagging</a>.
</p>
<p>The information will be displayed once per granule size
(the amount of bytes a particular memory tag covers).  For example, AArch64
has a granule size of 16 bytes, so it will display a tag every 16 bytes.
</p>
<p>Due to the way <small>GDB</small> prints information with the <code>x</code> command (not
aligned to a particular boundary), the tag information will refer to the
initial address displayed on a particular line.  If a memory tag boundary
is crossed in the middle of a line displayed by the <code>x</code> command, it
will be displayed on the next line.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>m</samp>’ format doesn’t affect any other specified formats that were
passed to the <code>x</code> command.
</p>
<a name="index-_0024_005f_002c-_0024_005f_005f_002c-and-value-history"></a>
<p>The addresses and contents printed by the <code>x</code> command are not saved
in the value history because there is often too much of them and they
would get in the way.  Instead, <small>GDB</small> makes these values available for
subsequent use in expressions as values of the convenience variables
<code>$_</code> and <code>$__</code>.  After an <code>x</code> command, the last address
examined is available for use in expressions in the convenience variable
<code>$_</code>.  The contents of that address, as examined, are available in
the convenience variable <code>$__</code>.
</p>
<p>If the <code>x</code> command has a repeat count, the address and contents saved
are from the last memory unit printed; this is not the same as the last
address printed if several units were printed on the last line of output.
</p>
<a name="addressable-memory-unit"></a><a name="index-addressable-memory-unit"></a>
<p>Most targets have an addressable memory unit size of 8 bits.  This means
that to each memory address are associated 8 bits of data.  Some
targets, however, have other addressable memory unit sizes.
Within <small>GDB</small> and this document, the term
<em>addressable memory unit</em> (or <em>memory unit</em> for short) is used
when explicitly referring to a chunk of data of that size.  The word
<em>byte</em> is used to refer to a chunk of data of 8 bits, regardless of
the addressable memory unit size of the target.  For most systems,
addressable memory unit is a synonym of byte.

<p>When you are debugging a program running on a remote target machine
(see <a href="#Remote-Debugging">Remote Debugging</a>), you may wish to verify the program’s image
in the remote machine’s memory against the executable file you
downloaded to the target.  Or, on any target, you may want to check
whether the program has corrupted its own read-only sections.  The
<code>compare-sections</code> command is provided for such situations.

<dt><code>compare-sections <span>[</span><var>section-name</var><span>|</span><code>-r</code><span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Compare the data of a loadable section <var>section-name</var> in the

<code>-r</code>, compares all loadable read-only sections.
</p>
<p>Note: for remote targets, this command can be accelerated if the
target supports computing the CRC checksum of a block of memory

<a name="Memory-Tagging"></a>

<a name="Memory-Tagging-1"></a>
<h3>10.7 Memory Tagging</h3>

<p>Memory tagging is a memory protection technology that uses a pair of tags to
validate memory accesses through pointers.  The tags are integer values
usually comprised of a few bits, depending on the architecture.
</p>
<p>There are two types of tags that are used in this setup: logical and
allocation.  A logical tag is stored in the pointers themselves, usually at the
higher bits of the pointers.  An allocation tag is the tag associated
with particular ranges of memory in the physical address space, against which
the logical tags from pointers are compared.
</p>
<p>The pointer tag (logical tag) must match the memory tag (allocation tag)
for the memory access to be valid.  If the logical tag does not match the
allocation tag, that will raise a memory violation.
</p>
<p>Allocation tags cover multiple contiguous bytes of physical memory.  This
range of bytes is called a memory tag granule and is architecture-specific.
For example,  AArch64 has a tag granule of 16 bytes, meaning each allocation
tag spans 16 bytes of memory.
</p>
<p>If the underlying architecture supports memory tagging, like AArch64 MTE
or SPARC ADI do,  <small>GDB</small> can make use of it to validate pointers
against memory allocation tags.
</p>
<p>The <code>print</code> (see <a href="#Data">Data</a>) and <code>x</code> (see <a href="#Memory">Memory</a>) commands will
display tag information when appropriate, and a command prefix of
<code>memory-tag</code> gives access to the various memory tagging commands.
</p>
<p>The <code>memory-tag</code> commands are the following:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-memory_002dtag-print_002dlogical_002dtag"></a>

<dt><code>memory-tag check <var>pointer_expression</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Check if the logical tag in the pointer given by <var>pointer_expression</var>
matches the allocation tag for the memory referenced by the pointer.
</p>
<p>This essentially emulates the hardware validation that is done when tagged
memory is accessed through a pointer, but does not cause a memory fault as
it would during hardware validation.
</p>
<p>It can be used to inspect potential memory tagging violations in the running
process, before any faults get triggered.

<a name="Auto-Display"></a>

<a name="Automatic-Display"></a>
<h3>10.8 Automatic Display</h3>
<a name="index-automatic-display"></a>
<a name="index-display-of-expressions"></a>

<p>If you find that you want to print the value of an expression frequently
(to see how it changes), you might want to add it to the <em>automatic
display list</em> so that <small>GDB</small> prints its value each time your program stops.
Each expression added to the list is given a number to identify it;
to remove an expression from the list, you specify that number.
The automatic display looks like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>2: foo = 38
3: bar[5] = (struct hack *) 0x3804
</pre></div>

<p>This display shows item numbers, expressions and their current values.  As with
displays you request manually using <code>x</code> or <code>print</code>, you can
specify the output format you prefer; in fact, <code>display</code> decides
whether to use <code>print</code> or <code>x</code> depending your format
specification—it uses <code>x</code> if you specify either the ‘<samp>i</samp>’
or ‘<samp>s</samp>’ format, or a unit size; otherwise it uses <code>print</code>.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-display"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>display <var>expr</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Add the expression <var>expr</var> to the list of expressions to display

<dt><code>display/<var>fmt</var> <var>expr</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>For <var>fmt</var> specifying only a display format and not a size or

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>display/<var>fmt</var> <var>addr</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>For <var>fmt</var> ‘<samp>i</samp>’ or ‘<samp>s</samp>’, or including a unit-size or a
number of units, add the expression <var>addr</var> as a memory address to

doing ‘<samp>x/<var>fmt</var> <var>addr</var></samp>’.  See <a href="#Memory">Examining Memory</a>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, ‘<samp>display/i $pc</samp>’ can be helpful, to see the machine
instruction about to be executed each time execution stops (‘<samp>$pc</samp>’
is a common name for the program counter; see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>).

</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-display-disabled-out-of-scope"></a>
<p>If a display expression refers to local variables, then it does not make
sense outside the lexical context for which it was set up.  Such an
expression is disabled when execution enters a context where one of its
variables is not defined.  For example, if you give the command
<code>display last_char</code> while inside a function with an argument
<code>last_char</code>, <small>GDB</small> displays this argument while your program
continues to stop inside that function.  When it stops elsewhere—where
there is no variable <code>last_char</code>—the display is disabled
automatically.  The next time your program stops where <code>last_char</code>
is meaningful, you can enable the display expression once again.

<h3>10.9 Print Settings</h3>

<a name="index-format-options"></a>
<a name="index-print-settings"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> provides the following ways to control how arrays, structures,
and symbols are printed.
</p>
<p>These settings are useful for debugging programs in any language:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-print"></a>
<a name="set-print-address"></a></dd>
<dt><code>set print address</code></dt>
<dt><code>set print address on</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-print_002fdon_0027t-print-memory-addresses"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> prints memory addresses showing the location of stack
traces, structure values, pointer values, breakpoints, and so forth,
even when it also displays the contents of those addresses.  The default
is <code>on</code>.  For example, this is what a stack frame display looks like with
<code>set print address on</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) f
#0  set_quotes (lq=0x34c78 &#34;&lt;&lt;&#34;, rq=0x34c88 &#34;&gt;&gt;&#34;)
    at input.c:530
530         if (lquote != def_lquote)
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>set print address off</code></dt>
<dd><p>Do not print addresses when displaying their contents.  For example,
this is the same stack frame displayed with <code>set print address off</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) set print addr off
(gdb) f
#0  set_quotes (lq=&#34;&lt;&lt;&#34;, rq=&#34;&gt;&gt;&#34;) at input.c:530
530         if (lquote != def_lquote)
</pre></div>

<p>You can use ‘<samp>set print address off</samp>’ to eliminate all machine
dependent displays from the <small>GDB</small> interface.  For example, with
<code>print address off</code>, you should get the same text for backtraces on
all machines—whether or not they involve pointer arguments.
</p>
<a name="index-show-print"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>show print address</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show whether or not addresses are to be printed.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>When <small>GDB</small> prints a symbolic address, it normally prints the
closest earlier symbol plus an offset.  If that symbol does not uniquely
identify the address (for example, it is a name whose scope is a single
source file), you may need to clarify.  One way to do this is with
<code>info line</code>, for example ‘<samp>info line *0x4537</samp>’.  Alternately,
you can set <small>GDB</small> to print the source file and line number when
it prints a symbolic address:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set print symbol-filename on</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-source-file-and-line-of-a-symbol"></a>
<a name="index-symbol_002c-source-file-and-line"></a>
<p>Tell <small>GDB</small> to print the source file name and line number of a
symbol in the symbolic form of an address.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set print symbol-filename off</code></dt>
<dd><p>Do not print source file name and line number of a symbol.  This is the
default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show print symbol-filename</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show whether or not <small>GDB</small> will print the source file name and
line number of a symbol in the symbolic form of an address.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Another situation where it is helpful to show symbol filenames and line
numbers is when disassembling code; <small>GDB</small> shows you the line
number and source file that corresponds to each instruction.
</p>
<p>Also, you may wish to see the symbolic form only if the address being
printed is reasonably close to the closest earlier symbol:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set print max-symbolic-offset <var>max-offset</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>set print max-symbolic-offset unlimited</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-maximum-value-for-offset-of-closest-symbol"></a>
<p>Tell <small>GDB</small> to only display the symbolic form of an address if the
offset between the closest earlier symbol and the address is less than
<var>max-offset</var>.  The default is <code>unlimited</code>, which tells <small>GDB</small>
to always print the symbolic form of an address if any symbol precedes
it.  Zero is equivalent to <code>unlimited</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show print max-symbolic-offset</code></dt>
<dd><p>Ask how large the maximum offset is that <small>GDB</small> prints in a
symbolic address.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-wild-pointer_002c-interpreting"></a>
<a name="index-pointer_002c-finding-referent"></a>
<p>If you have a pointer and you are not sure where it points, try
‘<samp>set print symbol-filename on</samp>’.  Then you can determine the name
and source file location of the variable where it points, using
‘<samp>p/a <var>pointer</var></samp>’.  This interprets the address in symbolic form.
For example, here <small>GDB</small> shows that a variable <code>ptt</code> points
at another variable <code>t</code>, defined in <samp>hi2.c</samp>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) set print symbol-filename on
(gdb) p/a ptt
$4 = 0xe008 &lt;t in hi2.c&gt;
</pre></div>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Warning:</em> For pointers that point to a local variable, ‘<samp>p/a</samp>’
does not show the symbol name and filename of the referent, even with
the appropriate <code>set print</code> options turned on.
</p></blockquote>

<p>You can also enable ‘<samp>/a</samp>’-like formatting all the time using
‘<samp>set print symbol on</samp>’:
</p>
<a name="set-print-symbol"></a><dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set print symbol on</code></dt>

one exists.

</dd>
<dt><code>set print symbol off</code></dt>
<dd><p>Tell <small>GDB</small> not to print the symbol corresponding to an
address.  In this mode, <small>GDB</small> will still print the symbol
corresponding to pointers to functions.  This is the default.

<dt><code>show print symbol</code></dt>

<p>By default, only scalar arguments are printed.  This command can be used
to configure the debugger to print the value of all arguments, regardless
of their type.  However, it is often advantageous to not print the value
of more complex parameters.  For instance, it reduces the amount of
information printed in each frame, making the backtrace more readable.
Also, it improves performance when displaying Ada frames, because
the computation of large arguments can sometimes be CPU-intensive,
especially in large applications.  Setting <code>print frame-arguments</code>
to <code>scalars</code> (the default), <code>none</code> or <code>presence</code> avoids
this computation, thus speeding up the display of each Ada frame.

<p>Set printing of frame argument values at function entry.  In some cases
<small>GDB</small> can determine the value of function argument which was passed by
the function caller, even if the value was modified inside the called function
and therefore is different.  With optimized code, the current value could be
unavailable, but the entry value may still be known.
</p>
<p>The default value is <code>default</code> (see below for its description).  Older
<small>GDB</small> behaved as with the setting <code>no</code>.  Compilers not supporting
this feature will behave in the <code>default</code> setting the same way as with the
<code>no</code> setting.
</p>
<p>This functionality is currently supported only by DWARF 2 debugging format and
the compiler has to produce ‘<samp>DW_TAG_call_site</samp>’ tags.  With
<small>GCC</small>, you need to specify <samp>-O -g</samp> during compilation, to get
this information.

<p>This command allows to control the information printed when
the debugger prints a frame.  See <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>, <a href="#Backtrace">Backtrace</a>,
for a general explanation about frames and frame information.
Note that some other settings (such as <code>set print frame-arguments</code>
and <code>set print address</code>) are also influencing if and how some frame
information is displayed.  In particular, the frame program counter is never
printed if <code>set print address</code> is off.
</p>
<p>The possible values for <code>set print frame-info</code> are:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>short-location</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the frame level, the program counter (if not at the
beginning of the location source line), the function, the function

<dd><p>Print what <code>location</code> and <code>source-line</code> are printing.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>auto</code></dt>
<dd><p>The information printed for a frame is decided automatically
by the <small>GDB</small> command that prints a frame.
For example, <code>frame</code> prints the information printed by
<code>source-and-location</code> while <code>stepi</code> will switch between

counter.
The default value is <code>auto</code>.

<div>
<pre>typedef struct s1 { int a; } s1;
typedef struct s2 { s1 b; } s2;
typedef struct s3 { s2 c; } s3;
typedef struct s4 { s3 d; } s4;

s4 var = { { { { 3 } } } };
</pre></div>

<p>The following table shows how different values of <var>depth</var> will

<h3>10.10 Pretty Printing</h3>

<p><small>GDB</small> provides a mechanism to allow pretty-printing of values using
Python code.  It greatly simplifies the display of complex objects.  This
mechanism works for both MI and the CLI.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Pretty_002dPrinter-Introduction"></a>

<a name="Pretty_002dPrinter-Introduction-1"></a>
<h4>10.10.1 Pretty-Printer Introduction</h4>

<p>When <small>GDB</small> prints a value, it first sees if there is a pretty-printer
registered for the value.  If there is then <small>GDB</small> invokes the
pretty-printer to print the value.  Otherwise the value is printed normally.
</p>
<p>Pretty-printers are normally named.  This makes them easy to manage.
The ‘<samp>info pretty-printer</samp>’ command will list all the installed
pretty-printers with their names.
If a pretty-printer can handle multiple data types, then its
<em>subprinters</em> are the printers for the individual data types.
Each such subprinter has its own name.
The format of the name is <var>printer-name</var>;<var>subprinter-name</var>.
</p>
<p>Pretty-printers are installed by <em>registering</em> them with <small>GDB</small>.
Typically they are automatically loaded and registered when the corresponding
debug information is loaded, thus making them available without having to
do anything special.
</p>
<p>There are three places where a pretty-printer can be registered.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Pretty-printers registered globally are available when debugging
all inferiors.

</li><li> Pretty-printers registered with a program space are available only
when debugging that program.
See <a href="#Progspaces-In-Python">Progspaces In Python</a>, for more details on program spaces in Python.

</li><li> Pretty-printers registered with an objfile are loaded and unloaded
with the corresponding objfile (e.g., shared library).
See <a href="#Objfiles-In-Python">Objfiles In Python</a>, for more details on objfiles in Python.
</li></ul>

<p>See <a href="#Selecting-Pretty_002dPrinters">Selecting Pretty-Printers</a>, for further information on how 
pretty-printers are selected,
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Writing-a-Pretty_002dPrinter">Writing a Pretty-Printer</a>, for implementing pretty printers
for new types.

<p>Example:
</p>
<p>Suppose we have three pretty-printers installed: one from library1.so
named <code>foo</code> that prints objects of type <code>foo</code>, and
another from library2.so named <code>bar</code> that prints two types of objects,
<code>bar1</code> and <code>bar2</code>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) info pretty-printer

<p>Note that for <code>bar</code> the entire printer can be disabled,
as can each individual subprinter.

<p>Printing values and frame arguments is done by default using
the enabled pretty printers.
</p>
<p>The print option <code>-raw-values</code> and <small>GDB</small> setting
<code>set print raw-values</code> (see <a href="#set-print-raw_002dvalues">set print raw-values</a>) can be
used to print values without applying the enabled pretty printers.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the backtrace option <code>-raw-frame-arguments</code> and
<small>GDB</small> setting <code>set print raw-frame-arguments</code>
(see <a href="#set-print-raw_002dframe_002darguments">set print raw-frame-arguments</a>) can be used to ignore the
enabled pretty printers when printing frame argument values.

<h3>10.11 Value History</h3>

<a name="index-value-history"></a>
<a name="index-history-of-values-printed-by-GDB"></a>
<p>Values printed by the <code>print</code> command are saved in the <small>GDB</small>
<em>value history</em>.  This allows you to refer to them in other expressions.
Values are kept until the symbol table is re-read or discarded
(for example with the <code>file</code> or <code>symbol-file</code> commands).
When the symbol table changes, the value history is discarded,
since the values may contain pointers back to the types defined in the
symbol table.
</p>
<a name="index-_0024"></a>
<a name="index-_0024_0024"></a>
<a name="index-history-number"></a>
<p>The values printed are given <em>history numbers</em> by which you can
refer to them.  These are successive integers starting with one.
<code>print</code> shows you the history number assigned to a value by
printing ‘<samp>$<var>num</var> = </samp>’ before the value; here <var>num</var> is the
history number.
</p>
<p>To refer to any previous value, use ‘<samp>$</samp>’ followed by the value’s
history number.  The way <code>print</code> labels its output is designed to
remind you of this.  Just <code>$</code> refers to the most recent value in
the history, and <code>$$</code> refers to the value before that.
<code>$$<var>n</var></code> refers to the <var>n</var>th value from the end; <code>$$2</code>
is the value just prior to <code>$$</code>, <code>$$1</code> is equivalent to
<code>$$</code>, and <code>$$0</code> is equivalent to <code>$</code>.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose you have just printed a pointer to a structure and
want to see the contents of the structure.  It suffices to type
</p>


<p>If you have a chain of structures where the component <code>next</code> points
to the next one, you can print the contents of the next one with this:
</p>


<p>You can print successive links in the chain by repeating this
command—which you can do by just typing <tt>RET</tt>.
</p>
<p>Note that the history records values, not expressions.  If the value of
<code>x</code> is 4 and you type these commands:
</p>


<p>then the value recorded in the value history by the <code>print</code> command
remains 4 even though the value of <code>x</code> has changed.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-show-values"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>show values</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the last ten values in the value history, with their item numbers.
This is like ‘<samp>p $$9</samp>’ repeated ten times, except that <code>show
values</code> does not change the history.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show values <var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Print ten history values centered on history item number <var>n</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show values +</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print ten history values just after the values last printed.  If no more
values are available, <code>show values +</code> produces no display.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Pressing <tt>RET</tt> to repeat <code>show values <var>n</var></code> has exactly the
same effect as ‘<samp>show values +</samp>’.

<h3>10.12 Convenience Variables</h3>

<a name="index-convenience-variables"></a>
<a name="index-user_002ddefined-variables"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> provides <em>convenience variables</em> that you can use within
<small>GDB</small> to hold on to a value and refer to it later.  These variables
exist entirely within <small>GDB</small>; they are not part of your program, and
setting a convenience variable has no direct effect on further execution
of your program.  That is why you can use them freely.
</p>
<p>Convenience variables are prefixed with ‘<samp>$</samp>’.  Any name preceded by
‘<samp>$</samp>’ can be used for a convenience variable, unless it is one of
the predefined machine-specific register names (see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>).
(Value history references, in contrast, are <em>numbers</em> preceded
by ‘<samp>$</samp>’.  See <a href="#Value-History">Value History</a>.)
</p>
<p>You can save a value in a convenience variable with an assignment
expression, just as you would set a variable in your program.
For example:
</p>


<p>would save in <code>$foo</code> the value contained in the object pointed to by
<code>object_ptr</code>.
</p>
<p>Using a convenience variable for the first time creates it, but its
value is <code>void</code> until you assign a new value.  You can alter the
value with another assignment at any time.
</p>
<p>Convenience variables have no fixed types.  You can assign a convenience
variable any type of value, including structures and arrays, even if
that variable already has a value of a different type.  The convenience
variable, when used as an expression, has the type of its current value.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-show-convenience"></a>
<a name="index-show-all-user-variables-and-functions"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>show convenience</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print a list of convenience variables used so far, and their values,
as well as a list of the convenience functions.
Abbreviated <code>show conv</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-init_002dif_002dundefined"></a>
<a name="index-convenience-variables_002c-initializing"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>init-if-undefined $<var>variable</var> = <var>expression</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set a convenience variable if it has not already been set.  This is useful
for user-defined commands that keep some state.  It is similar, in concept,
to using local static variables with initializers in C (except that
convenience variables are global).  It can also be used to allow users to
override default values used in a command script.
</p>
<p>If the variable is already defined then the expression is not evaluated so
any side-effects do not occur.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>One of the ways to use a convenience variable is as a counter to be
incremented or a pointer to be advanced.  For example, to print
a field from successive elements of an array of structures:
</p>
<div>
<pre>set $i = 0
print bar[$i++]-&gt;contents
</pre></div>

<p>Repeat that command by typing <tt>RET</tt>.
</p>
<p>Some convenience variables are created automatically by <small>GDB</small> and given
values likely to be useful.

<dd><a name="index-_0024_005f_002c-convenience-variable"></a>

<dt><code>$_</code></dt>
<dd><p>The variable <code>$_</code> is automatically set by the <code>x</code> command to

commands which provide a default address for <code>x</code> to examine also
set <code>$_</code> to that address; these commands include <code>info line</code>
and <code>info breakpoint</code>.  The type of <code>$_</code> is <code>void *</code>
except when set by the <code>x</code> command, in which case it is a pointer
to the type of <code>$__</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-_0024_005f_005f_002c-convenience-variable"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>$__</code></dt>
<dd><p>The variable <code>$__</code> is automatically set by the <code>x</code> command

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>$_exitcode</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_0024_005fexitcode_002c-convenience-variable"></a>
<p>When the program being debugged terminates normally, <small>GDB</small>
automatically sets this variable to the exit code of the program, and
resets <code>$_exitsignal</code> to <code>void</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>$_exitsignal</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_0024_005fexitsignal_002c-convenience-variable"></a>
<p>When the program being debugged dies due to an uncaught signal,
<small>GDB</small> automatically sets this variable to that signal’s number,
and resets <code>$_exitcode</code> to <code>void</code>.
</p>
<p>To distinguish between whether the program being debugged has exited
(i.e., <code>$_exitcode</code> is not <code>void</code>) or signalled (i.e.,
<code>$_exitsignal</code> is not <code>void</code>), the convenience function
<code>$_isvoid</code> can be used (see <a href="#Convenience-Funs">Convenience
Functions</a>).  For example, considering the following source code:
</p>
<div>
<pre>#include &lt;signal.h&gt;

int
main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  raise (SIGALRM);
  return 0;
}
</pre></div>

<p>A valid way of telling whether the program being debugged has exited
or signalled would be:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) define has_exited_or_signalled
Type commands for definition of ``has_exited_or_signalled&#39;&#39;.
End with a line saying just ``end&#39;&#39;.
&gt;if $_isvoid ($_exitsignal)
 &gt;echo The program has exited\n
 &gt;else
 &gt;echo The program has signalled\n
 &gt;end
&gt;end
(gdb) run
Starting program:

Program terminated with signal SIGALRM, Alarm clock.
The program no longer exists.
(gdb) has_exited_or_signalled
The program has signalled
</pre></div>

<p>As can be seen, <small>GDB</small> correctly informs that the program being
debugged has signalled, since it calls <code>raise</code> and raises a
<code>SIGALRM</code> signal.  If the program being debugged had not called
<code>raise</code>, then <small>GDB</small> would report a normal exit:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) has_exited_or_signalled
The program has exited
</pre></div>

<h3>10.13 Convenience Functions</h3>

<a name="index-convenience-functions"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> also supplies some <em>convenience functions</em>.  These
have a syntax similar to convenience variables.  A convenience
function can be used in an expression just like an ordinary function;
however, a convenience function is implemented internally to
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>These functions do not require <small>GDB</small> to be configured with
<code>Python</code> support, which means that they are always available.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>$_isvoid (<var>expr</var>)</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_0024_005fisvoid_002c-convenience-function"></a>
<p>Return one if the expression <var>expr</var> is <code>void</code>.  Otherwise it
returns zero.
</p>
<p>A <code>void</code> expression is an expression where the type of the result
is <code>void</code>.  For example, you can examine a convenience variable
(see <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Variables</a>) to check whether
it is <code>void</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print $_exitcode
$1 = void
(gdb) print $_isvoid ($_exitcode)
$2 = 1
(gdb) run
Starting program: ./a.out
[Inferior 1 (process 29572) exited normally]
(gdb) print $_exitcode
$3 = 0
(gdb) print $_isvoid ($_exitcode)
$4 = 0
</pre></div>

<p>In the example above, we used <code>$_isvoid</code> to check whether
<code>$_exitcode</code> is <code>void</code> before and after the execution of the
program being debugged.  Before the execution there is no exit code to
be examined, therefore <code>$_exitcode</code> is <code>void</code>.  After the
execution the program being debugged returned zero, therefore
<code>$_exitcode</code> is zero, which means that it is not <code>void</code>
anymore.
</p>
<p>The <code>void</code> expression can also be a call of a function from the
program being debugged.  For example, given the following function:
</p>


<p>The result of calling it inside <small>GDB</small> is <code>void</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print foo ()
$1 = void
(gdb) print $_isvoid (foo ())
$2 = 1
(gdb) set $v = foo ()
(gdb) print $v
$3 = void
(gdb) print $_isvoid ($v)
$4 = 1
</pre></div>

<dd><a name="index-_0024_005fgdb_005fsetting_005fstr_002c-convenience-function"></a>
<p>Return the value of the <small>GDB</small> <var>setting</var> as a string.
<var>setting</var> is any setting that can be used in a <code>set</code> or
<code>show</code> command (see <a href="#Controlling-GDB">Controlling GDB</a>).
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) show print frame-arguments
Printing of non-scalar frame arguments is &#34;scalars&#34;.
(gdb) p $_gdb_setting_str(&#34;print frame-arguments&#34;)
$1 = &#34;scalars&#34;

</dd>
<dt><code>$_gdb_setting (<var>setting</var>)</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_0024_005fgdb_005fsetting_002c-convenience-function"></a>
<p>Return the value of the <small>GDB</small> <var>setting</var>.
The type of the returned value depends on the setting.
</p>
<p>The value type for boolean and auto boolean settings is <code>int</code>.
The boolean values <code>off</code> and <code>on</code> are converted to
the integer values <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.  The value <code>auto</code> is
converted to the value <code>-1</code>.
</p>
<p>The value type for integer settings is either <code>unsigned int</code>
or <code>int</code>, depending on the setting.
</p>
<p>Some integer settings accept an <code>unlimited</code> value.
Depending on the setting, the <code>set</code> command also accepts
the value <code>0</code> or the value <code>-1</code> as a synonym for
<code>unlimited</code>.
For example, <code>set height unlimited</code> is equivalent to
<code>set height 0</code>.
</p>
<p>Some other settings that accept the <code>unlimited</code> value
use the value <code>0</code> to literally mean zero.
For example, <code>set history size 0</code> indicates to not
record any <small>GDB</small> commands in the command history.
For such settings, <code>-1</code> is the synonym
for <code>unlimited</code>.
</p>
<p>See the documentation of the corresponding <code>set</code> command for
the numerical value equivalent to <code>unlimited</code>.
</p>
<p>The <code>$_gdb_setting</code> function converts the unlimited value
to a <code>0</code> or a <code>-1</code> value according to what the
<code>set</code> command uses.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) p $_gdb_setting_str(&#34;height&#34;)

<h3>10.14 Registers</h3>

<a name="index-registers"></a>
<p>You can refer to machine register contents, in expressions, as variables

</dl>

<a name="standard-registers"></a><a name="index-stack-pointer-register"></a>
<a name="index-program-counter-register"></a>
<a name="index-process-status-register"></a>
<a name="index-frame-pointer-register"></a>
<a name="index-standard-registers"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> has four “standard” register names that are available (in
expressions) on most machines—whenever they do not conflict with an
architecture’s canonical mnemonics for registers.  The register names
<code>$pc</code> and <code>$sp</code> are used for the program counter register and
the stack pointer.  <code>$fp</code> is used for a register that contains a
pointer to the current stack frame, and <code>$ps</code> is used for a
register that contains the processor status.  For example,
you could print the program counter in hex with
</p>


<p>or print the instruction to be executed next with
</p>


<p>or add four to the stack pointer<a name="DOCF12" href="#FOOT12"><sup>12</sup></a> with
</p>


<p>Whenever possible, these four standard register names are available on
your machine even though the machine has different canonical mnemonics,
so long as there is no conflict.  The <code>info registers</code> command
shows the canonical names.  For example, on the SPARC, <code>info
registers</code> displays the processor status register as <code>$psr</code> but you
can also refer to it as <code>$ps</code>; and on x86-based machines <code>$ps</code>
is an alias for the <small>EFLAGS</small> register.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> always considers the contents of an ordinary register as an
integer when the register is examined in this way.  Some machines have
special registers which can hold nothing but floating point; these
registers are considered to have floating point values.  There is no way
to refer to the contents of an ordinary register as floating point value
(although you can <em>print</em> it as a floating point value with
‘<samp>print/f $<var>regname</var></samp>’).
</p>
<p>Some registers have distinct “raw” and “virtual” data formats.  This
means that the data format in which the register contents are saved by
the operating system is not the same one that your program normally
sees.  For example, the registers of the 68881 floating point
coprocessor are always saved in “extended” (raw) format, but all C
programs expect to work with “double” (virtual) format.  In such
cases, <small>GDB</small> normally works with the virtual format only (the format
that makes sense for your program), but the <code>info registers</code> command
prints the data in both formats.
</p>
<a name="index-SSE-registers-_0028x86_0029"></a>
<a name="index-MMX-registers-_0028x86_0029"></a>
<p>Some machines have special registers whose contents can be interpreted
in several different ways.  For example, modern x86-based machines
have SSE and MMX registers that can hold several values packed
together in several different formats.  <small>GDB</small> refers to such
registers in <code>struct</code> notation:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print $xmm1
$1 = {
  v4_float = {0, 3.43859137e-038, 1.54142831e-044, 1.821688e-044},
  v2_double = {9.92129282474342e-303, 2.7585945287983262e-313},
  v16_int8 = &#34;\000\000\000\000\3706;\001\v\000\000\000\r\000\000&#34;,
  v8_int16 = {0, 0, 14072, 315, 11, 0, 13, 0},
  v4_int32 = {0, 20657912, 11, 13},
  v2_int64 = {88725056443645952, 55834574859},
  uint128 = 0x0000000d0000000b013b36f800000000
}
</pre></div>

<p>To set values of such registers, you need to tell <small>GDB</small> which
view of the register you wish to change, as if you were assigning
value to a <code>struct</code> member:
</p>
<div>
<pre> (gdb) set $xmm1.uint128 = 0x000000000000000000000000FFFFFFFF
</pre></div>

<p>Normally, register values are relative to the selected stack frame
(see <a href="#Selection">Selecting a Frame</a>).  This means that you get the
value that the register would contain if all stack frames farther in
were exited and their saved registers restored.  In order to see the
true contents of hardware registers, you must select the innermost
frame (with ‘<samp>frame 0</samp>’).
</p>
<a name="index-caller_002dsaved-registers"></a>
<a name="index-call_002dclobbered-registers"></a>
<a name="index-volatile-registers"></a>
<a name="index-_003cnot-saved_003e-values"></a>
<p>Usually ABIs reserve some registers as not needed to be saved by the
callee (a.k.a.: “caller-saved”, “call-clobbered” or “volatile”
registers).  It may therefore not be possible for <small>GDB</small> to know
the value a register had before the call (in other words, in the outer
frame), if the register value has since been changed by the callee.
<small>GDB</small> tries to deduce where the inner frame saved
(“callee-saved”) registers, from the debug info, unwind info, or the
machine code generated by your compiler.  If some register is not
saved, and <small>GDB</small> knows the register is “caller-saved” (via
its own knowledge of the ABI, or because the debug/unwind info
explicitly says the register’s value is undefined), <small>GDB</small>
displays ‘<samp>&lt;not saved&gt;</samp>’<!-- /@w --> as the register’s value.  With targets
that <small>GDB</small> has no knowledge of the register saving convention,
if a register was not saved by the callee, then its value and location
in the outer frame are assumed to be the same of the inner frame.
This is usually harmless, because if the register is call-clobbered,
the caller either does not care what is in the register after the
call, or has code to restore the value that it does care about.  Note,
however, that if you change such a register in the outer frame, you
may also be affecting the inner frame.  Also, the more “outer” the
frame is you’re looking at, the more likely a call-clobbered
register’s value is to be wrong, in the sense that it doesn’t actually
represent the value the register had just before the call.

</p>
<a name="index-auxiliary-vector"></a>
<a name="index-vector_002c-auxiliary"></a>
<p>Some operating systems supply an <em>auxiliary vector</em> to programs at
startup.  This is akin to the arguments and environment that you
specify for a program, but contains a system-dependent variety of
binary values that tell system libraries important details about the
hardware, operating system, and process.  Each value’s purpose is
identified by an integer tag; the meanings are well-known but system-specific.
Depending on the configuration and operating system facilities,
<small>GDB</small> may be able to show you this information.  For remote
targets, this functionality may further depend on the remote stub’s
support of the ‘<samp>qXfer:auxv:read</samp>’ packet, see

<h3>10.18 Memory Region Attributes</h3>
<a name="index-memory-region-attributes"></a>

<p><em>Memory region attributes</em> allow you to describe special handling
required by regions of your target’s memory.  <small>GDB</small> uses
attributes to determine whether to allow certain types of memory
accesses; whether to use specific width accesses; and whether to cache
target memory.  By default the description of memory regions is
fetched from the target (if the current target supports this), but the
user can override the fetched regions.
</p>
<p>Defined memory regions can be individually enabled and disabled.  When a
memory region is disabled, <small>GDB</small> uses the default attributes when
accessing memory in that region.  Similarly, if no memory regions have
been defined, <small>GDB</small> uses the default attributes when accessing
all memory.
</p>
<p>When a memory region is defined, it is given a number to identify it;
to enable, disable, or remove a memory region, you specify that number.

<h4>10.18.1.2 Memory Access Size</h4>
<p>The access size attribute tells <small>GDB</small> to use specific sized

<h4>10.18.2 Memory Access Checking</h4>
<p><small>GDB</small> can be instructed to refuse accesses to memory that is

<h3>10.20 How to Produce a Core File from Your Program</h3>
<a name="index-dump-core-from-inferior"></a>

<p>A <em>core file</em> or <em>core dump</em> is a file that records the memory
image of a running process and its process status (register values
etc.).  Its primary use is post-mortem debugging of a program that
crashed while it ran outside a debugger.  A program that crashes
automatically produces a core file, unless this feature is disabled by
the user.  See <a href="#Files">Files</a>, for information on invoking <small>GDB</small> in
the post-mortem debugging mode.
</p>
<p>Occasionally, you may wish to produce a core file of the program you
are debugging in order to preserve a snapshot of its state.
<small>GDB</small> has a special command for that.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<dt><code>gcore [<var>file</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Produce a core dump of the inferior process.  The optional argument
<var>file</var> specifies the file name where to put the core dump.  If not
specified, the file name defaults to <samp>core.<var>pid</var></samp>, where
<var>pid</var> is the inferior process ID.
</p>
<p>Note that this command is implemented only for some systems (as of
this writing, <small>GNU</small>/Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and S390).
</p>
<p>On <small>GNU</small>/Linux, this command can take into account the value of the
file <samp>/proc/<var>pid</var>/coredump_filter</samp> when generating the core
dump (see <a href="#set-use_002dcoredump_002dfilter">set use-coredump-filter</a>), and by default honors the
<code>VM_DONTDUMP</code> flag for mappings where it is present in the file
<samp>/proc/<var>pid</var>/smaps</samp> (see <a href="#set-dump_002dexcluded_002dmappings">set dump-excluded-mappings</a>).

<dd><p>Enable or disable the use of the file

memory mappings will be dumped or ignored when generating a core dump
file.  <var>pid</var> is the process ID of a currently running process.
</p>
<p>To make use of this feature, you have to write in the
<samp>/proc/<var>pid</var>/coredump_filter</samp> file a value, in hexadecimal,
which is a bit mask representing the memory mapping types.  If a bit
is set in the bit mask, then the memory mappings of the corresponding
types will be dumped; otherwise, they will be ignored.  This
configuration is inherited by child processes.  For more information
about the bits that can be set in the
<samp>/proc/<var>pid</var>/coredump_filter</samp> file, please refer to the
manpage of <code>core(5)</code>.
</p>
<p>By default, this option is <code>on</code>.  If this option is turned
<code>off</code>, <small>GDB</small> does not read the <samp>coredump_filter</samp> file
and instead uses the same default value as the Linux kernel in order
to decide which pages will be dumped in the core dump file.  This
value is currently <code>0x33</code>, which means that bits <code>0</code>
(anonymous private mappings), <code>1</code> (anonymous shared mappings),
<code>4</code> (ELF headers) and <code>5</code> (private huge pages) are active.
This will cause these memory mappings to be dumped automatically.

<a name="Character-Sets"></a>

<a name="Character-Sets-1"></a>
<h3>10.21 Character Sets</h3>
<a name="index-character-sets"></a>
<a name="index-charset"></a>
<a name="index-translating-between-character-sets"></a>
<a name="index-host-character-set"></a>
<a name="index-target-character-set"></a>

<p>If the program you are debugging uses a different character set to
represent characters and strings than the one <small>GDB</small> uses itself,
<small>GDB</small> can automatically translate between the character sets for
you.  The character set <small>GDB</small> uses we call the <em>host
character set</em>; the one the inferior program uses we call the
<em>target character set</em>.
</p>
<p>For example, if you are running <small>GDB</small> on a <small>GNU</small>/Linux system, which
uses the ISO Latin 1 character set, but you are using <small>GDB</small>’s
remote protocol (see <a href="#Remote-Debugging">Remote Debugging</a>) to debug a program
running on an IBM mainframe, which uses the <small>EBCDIC</small> character set,
then the host character set is Latin-1, and the target character set is
<small>EBCDIC</small>.  If you give <small>GDB</small> the command <code>set
target-charset EBCDIC-US</code>, then <small>GDB</small> translates between
<small>EBCDIC</small> and Latin 1 as you print character or string values, or use
character and string literals in expressions.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> has no way to automatically recognize which character set
the inferior program uses; you must tell it, using the <code>set
target-charset</code> command, described below.
</p>
<p>Here are the commands for controlling <small>GDB</small>’s character set
support:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set target-charset <var>charset</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-target_002dcharset"></a>
<p>Set the current target character set to <var>charset</var>.  To display the
list of supported target character sets, type
<kbd>set <span>target-charset</span> <span>TAB</span><span>TAB</span><!-- /@w --></kbd>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set host-charset <var>charset</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-host_002dcharset"></a>
<p>Set the current host character set to <var>charset</var>.
</p>
<p>By default, <small>GDB</small> uses a host character set appropriate to the
system it is running on; you can override that default using the
<code>set host-charset</code> command.  On some systems, <small>GDB</small> cannot
automatically determine the appropriate host character set.  In this
case, <small>GDB</small> uses ‘<samp>UTF-8</samp>’.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> can only use certain character sets as its host character
set.  If you type <kbd>set <span>host-charset</span> <span>TAB</span><span>TAB</span><!-- /@w --></kbd>,
<small>GDB</small> will list the host character sets it supports.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set charset <var>charset</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-charset"></a>
<p>Set the current host and target character sets to <var>charset</var>.  As
above, if you type <kbd>set charset <span>TAB</span><span>TAB</span><!-- /@w --></kbd>,
<small>GDB</small> will list the names of the character sets that can be used
for both host and target.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show charset</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show-charset"></a>
<p>Show the names of the current host and target character sets.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show host-charset</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show-host_002dcharset"></a>
<p>Show the name of the current host character set.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show target-charset</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show-target_002dcharset"></a>
<p>Show the name of the current target character set.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set target-wide-charset <var>charset</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-target_002dwide_002dcharset"></a>
<p>Set the current target’s wide character set to <var>charset</var>.  This is
the character set used by the target’s <code>wchar_t</code> type.  To
display the list of supported wide character sets, type
<kbd>set <span>target-wide-charset</span> <span>TAB</span><span>TAB</span><!-- /@w --></kbd>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show target-wide-charset</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show-target_002dwide_002dcharset"></a>
<p>Show the name of the current target’s wide character set.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Here is an example of <small>GDB</small>’s character set support in action.
Assume that the following source code has been placed in the file
<samp>charset-test.c</samp>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

char ascii_hello[]
  = {72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 119,
     111, 114, 108, 100, 33, 10, 0};
char ibm1047_hello[]
  = {200, 133, 147, 147, 150, 107, 64, 166,
     150, 153, 147, 132, 90, 37, 0};

main ()
{
  printf (&#34;Hello, world!\n&#34;);
}
</pre></div>

<p>In this program, <code>ascii_hello</code> and <code>ibm1047_hello</code> are arrays
containing the string ‘<samp>Hello, world!</samp>’ followed by a newline,
encoded in the <small>ASCII</small> and <small>IBM1047</small> character sets.
</p>
<p>We compile the program, and invoke the debugger on it:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ gcc -g charset-test.c -o charset-test
$ gdb -nw charset-test
GNU gdb 2001-12-19-cvs
Copyright 2001 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
…
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>We can use the <code>show charset</code> command to see what character sets
<small>GDB</small> is currently using to interpret and display characters and
strings:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) show charset
The current host and target character set is `ISO-8859-1&#39;.
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>For the sake of printing this manual, let’s use <small>ASCII</small> as our
initial character set:
</p><div>
<pre>(gdb) set charset ASCII
(gdb) show charset
The current host and target character set is `ASCII&#39;.
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>Let’s assume that <small>ASCII</small> is indeed the correct character set for our
host system — in other words, let’s assume that if <small>GDB</small> prints
characters using the <small>ASCII</small> character set, our terminal will display
them properly.  Since our current target character set is also
<small>ASCII</small>, the contents of <code>ascii_hello</code> print legibly:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print ascii_hello
$1 = 0x401698 &#34;Hello, world!\n&#34;
(gdb) print ascii_hello[0]
$2 = 72 &#39;H&#39;
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p><small>GDB</small> uses the target character set for character and string
literals you use in expressions:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print &#39;+&#39;
$3 = 43 &#39;+&#39;
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>The <small>ASCII</small> character set uses the number 43 to encode the ‘<samp>+</samp>’
character.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> relies on the user to tell it which character set the
target program uses.  If we print <code>ibm1047_hello</code> while our target
character set is still <small>ASCII</small>, we get jibberish:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print ibm1047_hello
$4 = 0x4016a8 &#34;\310\205\223\223\226k@\246\226\231\223\204Z%&#34;
(gdb) print ibm1047_hello[0]
$5 = 200 &#39;\310&#39;
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>If we invoke the <code>set target-charset</code> followed by <tt>TAB</tt><tt>TAB</tt>,
<small>GDB</small> tells us the character sets it supports:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) set target-charset
ASCII       EBCDIC-US   IBM1047     ISO-8859-1
(gdb) set target-charset
</pre></div>

<p>We can select <small>IBM1047</small> as our target character set, and examine the
program’s strings again.  Now the <small>ASCII</small> string is wrong, but
<small>GDB</small> translates the contents of <code>ibm1047_hello</code> from the
target character set, <small>IBM1047</small>, to the host character set,
<small>ASCII</small>, and they display correctly:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) set target-charset IBM1047
(gdb) show charset
The current host character set is `ASCII&#39;.
The current target character set is `IBM1047&#39;.
(gdb) print ascii_hello
$6 = 0x401698 &#34;\110\145%%?\054\040\167?\162%\144\041\012&#34;
(gdb) print ascii_hello[0]
$7 = 72 &#39;\110&#39;
(gdb) print ibm1047_hello
$8 = 0x4016a8 &#34;Hello, world!\n&#34;
(gdb) print ibm1047_hello[0]
$9 = 200 &#39;H&#39;
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>As above, <small>GDB</small> uses the target character set for character and
string literals you use in expressions:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print &#39;+&#39;
$10 = 78 &#39;+&#39;
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>The <small>IBM1047</small> character set uses the number 78 to encode the ‘<samp>+</samp>’
character.

<a name="Caching-Data-of-Targets"></a>
<h3>10.22 Caching Data of Targets</h3>
<a name="index-caching-data-of-targets"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> caches data exchanged between the debugger and a target.
Each cache is associated with the address space of the inferior.
See <a href="#Inferiors-Connections-and-Programs">Inferiors Connections and Programs</a>, about inferior and address space.
Such caching generally improves performance in remote debugging
(see <a href="#Remote-Debugging">Remote Debugging</a>), because it reduces the overhead of the
remote protocol by bundling memory reads and writes into large chunks.
Unfortunately, simply caching everything would lead to incorrect results,
since <small>GDB</small> does not necessarily know anything about volatile
values, memory-mapped I/O addresses, etc.  Furthermore, in non-stop mode
(see <a href="#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>) memory can be changed <em>while</em> a gdb command
is executing.
Therefore, by default, <small>GDB</small> only caches data
known to be on the stack<a name="DOCF13" href="#FOOT13"><sup>13</sup></a> or
in the code segment.
Other regions of memory can be explicitly marked as
cacheable; see <a href="#Memory-Region-Attributes">Memory Region Attributes</a>.

<dd><p>Search memory for the sequence of bytes specified by <var>val1</var>, <var>val2</var>,
etc.  The search begins at address <var>start_addr</var> and continues for either
<var>len</var> bytes or through to <var>end_addr</var> inclusive.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p><var>s</var> and <var>n</var> are optional parameters.
They may be specified in either order, apart or together.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><var>s</var>, search query size</span></dt>
<dd><p>The size of each search query value.

<dd><p>words (four bytes)
</p></dd>
<dt><code>g</code></dt>
<dd><p>giant words (eight bytes)
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>All values are interpreted in the current language.
This means, for example, that if the current source language is C/C<tt>++</tt>
then searching for the string “hello” includes the trailing ’\0’.
The null terminator can be removed from searching by using casts,
e.g.: ‘<samp>{char[5]}&#34;hello&#34;</samp>’.
</p>
<p>If the value size is not specified, it is taken from the
value’s type in the current language.
This is useful when one wants to specify the search
pattern as a mixture of types.
Note that this means, for example, that in the case of C-like languages
a search for an untyped 0x42 will search for ‘<samp>(int) 0x42</samp>’
which is typically four bytes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><var>n</var>, maximum number of finds</span></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum number of matches to print.  The default is to print all finds.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>You can use strings as search values.  Quote them with double-quotes
 (<code>&#34;</code>).
The string value is copied into the search pattern byte by byte,
regardless of the endianness of the target and the size specification.
</p>
<p>The address of each match found is printed as well as a count of the
number of matches found.
</p>
<p>The address of the last value found is stored in convenience variable
‘<samp>$_</samp>’.
A count of the number of matches is stored in ‘<samp>$numfound</samp>’.
</p>
<p>For example, if stopped at the <code>printf</code> in this function:
</p>
<div>
<pre>void
hello ()
{
  static char hello[] = &#34;hello-hello&#34;;
  static struct { char c; short s; int i; }
    __attribute__ ((packed)) mixed
    = { &#39;c&#39;, 0x1234, 0x87654321 };
  printf (&#34;%s\n&#34;, hello);
}
</pre></div>

<p>you get during debugging:

<h3>10.24 Value Sizes</h3>

<p>Whenever <small>GDB</small> prints a value memory will be allocated within
<small>GDB</small> to hold the contents of the value.  It is possible in
some languages with dynamic typing systems, that an invalid program
may indicate a value that is incorrectly large, this in turn may cause
<small>GDB</small> to try and allocate an overly large amount of memory.

</p>
<p>There’s a minimum size that <code>max-value-size</code> can be set to in

currently 16 bytes.
</p>
<p>The limit applies to the results of some subexpressions as well as to
complete expressions.  For example, an expression denoting a simple
integer component, such as <code>x.y.z</code>, may fail if the size of
<var>x.y</var> is dynamic and exceeds <var>bytes</var>.  On the other hand,
<small>GDB</small> is sometimes clever; the expression <code>A[i]</code>, where
<var>A</var> is an array variable with non-constant size, will generally
succeed regardless of the bounds on <var>A</var>, as long as the component
size is less than <var>bytes</var>.

<a name="Debugging-Optimized-Code"></a>
<h2>11 Debugging Optimized Code</h2>
<a name="index-optimized-code_002c-debugging"></a>
<a name="index-debugging-optimized-code"></a>

<p>Almost all compilers support optimization.  With optimization
disabled, the compiler generates assembly code that corresponds
directly to your source code, in a simplistic way.  As the compiler
applies more powerful optimizations, the generated assembly code
diverges from your original source code.  With help from debugging
information generated by the compiler, <small>GDB</small> can map from
the running program back to constructs from your original source.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> is more accurate with optimization disabled.  If you
can recompile without optimization, it is easier to follow the
progress of your program during debugging.  But, there are many cases
where you may need to debug an optimized version.
</p>
<p>When you debug a program compiled with ‘<samp>-g -O</samp>’, remember that the
optimizer has rearranged your code; the debugger shows you what is
really there.  Do not be too surprised when the execution path does not
exactly match your source file!  An extreme example: if you define a
variable, but never use it, <small>GDB</small> never sees that
variable—because the compiler optimizes it out of existence.
</p>
<p>Some things do not work as well with ‘<samp>-g -O</samp>’ as with just
‘<samp>-g</samp>’, particularly on machines with instruction scheduling.  If in
doubt, recompile with ‘<samp>-g</samp>’ alone, and if this fixes the problem,
please report it to us as a bug (including a test case!).
See <a href="#Variables">Variables</a>, for more information about debugging optimized code.

<a name="Inline-Functions"></a>

<a name="Inline-Functions-1"></a>
<h3>11.1 Inline Functions</h3>
<a name="index-inline-functions_002c-debugging"></a>

<p><em>Inlining</em> is an optimization that inserts a copy of the function
body directly at each call site, instead of jumping to a shared
routine.  <small>GDB</small> displays inlined functions just like
non-inlined functions.  They appear in backtraces.  You can view their
arguments and local variables, step into them with <code>step</code>, skip
them with <code>next</code>, and escape from them with <code>finish</code>.
You can check whether a function was inlined by using the
<code>info frame</code> command.
</p>
<p>For <small>GDB</small> to support inlined functions, the compiler must
record information about inlining in the debug information —
<small>GCC</small> using the <small>DWARF 2</small> format does this, and several
other compilers do also.  <small>GDB</small> only supports inlined functions
when using <small>DWARF 2</small>.  Versions of <small>GCC</small> before 4.1
do not emit two required attributes (‘<samp>DW_AT_call_file</samp>’ and
‘<samp>DW_AT_call_line</samp>’); <small>GDB</small> does not display inlined
function calls with earlier versions of <small>GCC</small>.  It instead
displays the arguments and local variables of inlined functions as
local variables in the caller.
</p>
<p>The body of an inlined function is directly included at its call site;
unlike a non-inlined function, there are no instructions devoted to
the call.  <small>GDB</small> still pretends that the call site and the
start of the inlined function are different instructions.  Stepping to
the call site shows the call site, and then stepping again shows
the first line of the inlined function, even though no additional
instructions are executed.
</p>
<p>This makes source-level debugging much clearer; you can see both the
context of the call and then the effect of the call.  Only stepping by
a single instruction using <code>stepi</code> or <code>nexti</code> does not do
this; single instruction steps always show the inlined body.
</p>
<p>There are some ways that <small>GDB</small> does not pretend that inlined
function calls are the same as normal calls:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Setting breakpoints at the call site of an inlined function may not
work, because the call site does not contain any code.  <small>GDB</small>
may incorrectly move the breakpoint to the next line of the enclosing
function, after the call.  This limitation will be removed in a future
version of <small>GDB</small>; until then, set a breakpoint on an earlier line
or inside the inlined function instead.

</li><li> <small>GDB</small> cannot locate the return value of inlined calls after
using the <code>finish</code> command.  This is a limitation of compiler-generated
debugging information; after <code>finish</code>, you can step to the next line
and print a variable where your program stored the return value.

</li></ul>

<a name="Tail-Call-Frames"></a>

<a name="Tail-Call-Frames-1"></a>
<h3>11.2 Tail Call Frames</h3>
<a name="index-tail-call-frames_002c-debugging"></a>

<p>Function <code>B</code> can call function <code>C</code> in its very last statement.  In
unoptimized compilation the call of <code>C</code> is immediately followed by return
instruction at the end of <code>B</code> code.  Optimizing compiler may replace the
call and return in function <code>B</code> into one jump to function <code>C</code>
instead.  Such use of a jump instruction is called <em>tail call</em>.
</p>
<p>During execution of function <code>C</code>, there will be no indication in the
function call stack frames that it was tail-called from <code>B</code>.  If function
<code>A</code> regularly calls function <code>B</code> which tail-calls function <code>C</code>,
then <small>GDB</small> will see <code>A</code> as the caller of <code>C</code>.  However, in
some cases <small>GDB</small> can determine that <code>C</code> was tail-called from
<code>B</code>, and it will then create fictitious call frame for that, with the
return address set up as if <code>B</code> called <code>C</code> normally.
</p>
<p>This functionality is currently supported only by DWARF 2 debugging format and
the compiler has to produce ‘<samp>DW_TAG_call_site</samp>’ tags.  With
<small>GCC</small>, you need to specify <samp>-O -g</samp> during compilation, to get
this information.
</p>
<p><kbd>info frame</kbd> command (see <a href="#Frame-Info">Frame Info</a>) will indicate the tail call frame
kind by text <code>tail call frame</code> such as in this sample <small>GDB</small> output:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) x/i $pc - 2

</pre></div>

<p>The detection of all the possible code path executions can find them ambiguous.
There is no execution history stored (possible <a href="#Reverse-Execution">Reverse Execution</a> is never
used for this purpose) and the last known caller could have reached the known
callee by multiple different jump sequences.  In such case <small>GDB</small> still
tries to show at least all the unambiguous top tail callers and all the
unambiguous bottom tail calees, if any.
</p>

</dl>

<p>The analysis messages for tail calls can for example show why the virtual tail
call frame for function <code>c</code> has not been recognized (due to the indirect
reference by variable <code>x</code>):
</p>
<div>
<pre>static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (void);
void (*x) (void) = c;
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (void) { x++; }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (void) { a (); }
int main (void) { x (); return 0; }

(gdb) bt
#0  a () at t.c:3
#1  0x000000000040039a in main () at t.c:5
</pre></div>

<p>Another possibility is an ambiguous virtual tail call frames resolution:
</p>
<div>
<pre>int i;
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) f (void) { i++; }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) e (void) { f (); }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) d (void) { f (); }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (void) { d (); }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) b (void)
{ if (i) c (); else e (); }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (void) { b (); }
int main (void) { a (); return 0; }

tailcall: initial: 0x4004d2(a) 0x4004ce(b) 0x4004b2(c) 0x4004a2(d)
tailcall: compare: 0x4004d2(a) 0x4004cc(b) 0x400492(e)

#2  0x0000000000400395 in main () at t.c:9
</pre></div>



<p>Frames #0 and #2 are real, #1 is a virtual tail call frame.
The code can have possible execution paths <code>main→a→b→c→d→f</code> or
<code>main→a→b→e→f</code>, <small>GDB</small> cannot find which one from the inferior state.
</p>
<p><code>initial:</code> state shows some random possible calling sequence <small>GDB</small>
has found.  It then finds another possible calling sequence - that one is
prefixed by <code>compare:</code>.  The non-ambiguous intersection of these two is
printed as the <code>reduced:</code> calling sequence.  That one could have many
further <code>compare:</code> and <code>reduced:</code> statements as long as there remain
any non-ambiguous sequence entries.
</p>
<p>For the frame of function <code>b</code> in both cases there are different possible
<code>$pc</code> values (<code>0x4004cc</code> or <code>0x4004ce</code>), therefore this frame is
also ambiguous.  The only non-ambiguous frame is the one for function <code>a</code>,
therefore this one is displayed to the user while the ambiguous frames are
omitted.
</p>
<p>There can be also reasons why printing of frame argument values at function
entry may fail:
</p>
<div>
<pre>int v;
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) c (int i) { v++; }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (int i);
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) b (int i) { a (i); }
static void __attribute__((noinline, noclone)) a (int i)
{ if (i) b (i - 1); else c (0); }
int main (void) { a (5); return 0; }

(gdb) bt
#0  c (i=i@entry=0) at t.c:2
#1  0x0000000000400428 in a (DW_OP_entry_value resolving has found
function &#34;a&#34; at 0x400420 can call itself via tail calls
i=&lt;optimized out&gt;) at t.c:6
#2  0x000000000040036e in main () at t.c:7
</pre></div>

<p><small>GDB</small> cannot find out from the inferior state if and how many times did
function <code>a</code> call itself (via function <code>b</code>) as these calls would be
tail calls.  Such tail calls would modify the <code>i</code> variable, therefore
<small>GDB</small> cannot be sure the value it knows would be right - <small>GDB</small>
prints <code>&lt;optimized out&gt;</code> instead.

<a name="Macros"></a>

<h2>12 C Preprocessor Macros</h2>

<p>Some languages, such as C and C<tt>++</tt>, provide a way to define and invoke
“preprocessor macros” which expand into strings of tokens.
<small>GDB</small> can evaluate expressions containing macro invocations, show
the result of macro expansion, and show a macro’s definition, including
where it was defined.
</p>
<p>You may need to compile your program specially to provide <small>GDB</small>
with information about preprocessor macros.  Most compilers do not
include macros in their debugging information, even when you compile
with the <samp>-g</samp> flag.  See <a href="#Compilation">Compilation</a>.
</p>
<p>A program may define a macro at one point, remove that definition later,
and then provide a different definition after that.  Thus, at different
points in the program, a macro may have different definitions, or have
no definition at all.  If there is a current stack frame, <small>GDB</small>
uses the macros in scope at that frame’s source code line.  Otherwise,
<small>GDB</small> uses the macros in scope at the current listing location;
see <a href="#List">List</a>.
</p>
<p>Whenever <small>GDB</small> evaluates an expression, it always expands any
macro invocations present in the expression.  <small>GDB</small> also provides
the following commands for working with macros explicitly.

<small>GCC</small>.  We pass the <samp>-gdwarf-2</samp><a name="DOCF14" href="#FOOT14"><sup>14</sup></a> <em>and</em> <samp>-g3</samp> flags to ensure the compiler
includes information about preprocessor macros in the debugging
information.
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ gcc -gdwarf-2 -g3 sample.c -o sample
$
</pre></div>

<p>Now, we start <small>GDB</small> on our sample program:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ gdb -nw sample
GNU gdb 2002-05-06-cvs
Copyright 2002 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
GDB is free software, …
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>We can expand macros and examine their definitions, even when the
program is not running.  <small>GDB</small> uses the current listing position
to decide which macro definitions are in scope:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) list main
3
4       #define M 42
5       #define ADD(x) (M + x)
6
7       main ()
8       {
9       #define N 28
10        printf (&#34;Hello, world!\n&#34;);
11      #undef N
12        printf (&#34;We&#39;re so creative.\n&#34;);
(gdb) info macro ADD
Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:5
#define ADD(x) (M + x)
(gdb) info macro Q
Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.h:1
  included at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:2
#define Q &lt;
(gdb) macro expand ADD(1)
expands to: (42 + 1)
(gdb) macro expand-once ADD(1)
expands to: once (M + 1)
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>In the example above, note that <code>macro expand-once</code> expands only
the macro invocation explicit in the original text — the invocation of
<code>ADD</code> — but does not expand the invocation of the macro <code>M</code>,
which was introduced by <code>ADD</code>.
</p>
<p>Once the program is running, <small>GDB</small> uses the macro definitions in
force at the source line of the current stack frame:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) break main
Breakpoint 1 at 0x8048370: file sample.c, line 10.
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample

Breakpoint 1, main () at sample.c:10
10        printf (&#34;Hello, world!\n&#34;);
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>At line 10, the definition of the macro <code>N</code> at line 9 is in force:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) info macro N
Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:9
#define N 28
(gdb) macro expand N Q M
expands to: 28 &lt; 42
(gdb) print N Q M
$1 = 1
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>As we step over directives that remove <code>N</code>’s definition, and then
give it a new definition, <small>GDB</small> finds the definition (or lack
thereof) in force at each point:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) next
Hello, world!
12        printf (&#34;We&#39;re so creative.\n&#34;);
(gdb) info macro N
The symbol `N&#39; has no definition as a C/C++ preprocessor macro
at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:12
(gdb) next
We&#39;re so creative.
14        printf (&#34;Goodbye, world!\n&#34;);
(gdb) info macro N
Defined at /home/jimb/gdb/macros/play/sample.c:13
#define N 1729
(gdb) macro expand N Q M
expands to: 1729 &lt; 42
(gdb) print N Q M
$2 = 0
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>In addition to source files, macros can be defined on the compilation command
line using the <samp>-D<var>name</var>=<var>value</var></samp> syntax.  For macros defined in
such a way, <small>GDB</small> displays the location of their definition as line zero
of the source file submitted to the compiler.
</p>

<h2>13 Tracepoints</h2>

<a name="index-tracepoints"></a>
<p>In some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt
the program’s execution long enough for the developer to learn
anything helpful about its behavior.  If the program’s correctness
depends on its real-time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger
might cause the program to change its behavior drastically, or perhaps
fail, even when the code itself is correct.  It is useful to be able
to observe the program’s behavior without interrupting it.
</p>
<p>Using <small>GDB</small>’s <code>trace</code> and <code>collect</code> commands, you can
specify locations in the program, called <em>tracepoints</em>, and
arbitrary expressions to evaluate when those tracepoints are reached.
Later, using the <code>tfind</code> command, you can examine the values
those expressions had when the program hit the tracepoints.  The
expressions may also denote objects in memory—structures or arrays,
for example—whose values <small>GDB</small> should record; while visiting
a particular tracepoint, you may inspect those objects as if they were
in memory at that moment.  However, because <small>GDB</small> records these
values without interacting with you, it can do so quickly and
unobtrusively, hopefully not disturbing the program’s behavior.
</p>
<p>The tracepoint facility is currently available only for remote
targets.  See <a href="#Targets">Targets</a>.  In addition, your remote target must know
how to collect trace data.  This functionality is implemented in the
remote stub; however, none of the stubs distributed with <small>GDB</small>
support tracepoints as of this writing.  The format of the remote
packets used to implement tracepoints are described in <a href="#Tracepoint-Packets">Tracepoint Packets</a>.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to get trace data from a file, in a manner reminiscent
of corefiles; you specify the filename, and use <code>tfind</code> to search
through the file.  See <a href="#Trace-Files">Trace Files</a>, for more details.
</p>
<p>This chapter describes the tracepoint commands and features.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Set-Tracepoints"></a>

<a name="Commands-to-Set-Tracepoints"></a>
<h3>13.1 Commands to Set Tracepoints</h3>

<p>Before running such a <em>trace experiment</em>, an arbitrary number of
tracepoints can be set.  A tracepoint is actually a special type of
breakpoint (see <a href="#Set-Breaks">Set Breaks</a>), so you can manipulate it using
standard breakpoint commands.  For instance, as with breakpoints,
tracepoint numbers are successive integers starting from one, and many
of the commands associated with tracepoints take the tracepoint number
as their argument, to identify which tracepoint to work on.
</p>
<p>For each tracepoint, you can specify, in advance, some arbitrary set
of data that you want the target to collect in the trace buffer when
it hits that tracepoint.  The collected data can include registers,
local variables, or global data.  Later, you can use <small>GDB</small>
commands to examine the values these data had at the time the
tracepoint was hit.
</p>
<p>Tracepoints do not support every breakpoint feature.  Ignore counts on
tracepoints have no effect, and tracepoints cannot run <small>GDB</small>
commands when they are hit.  Tracepoints may not be thread-specific
either.
</p>
<a name="index-fast-tracepoints"></a>
<p>Some targets may support <em>fast tracepoints</em>, which are inserted in
a different way (such as with a jump instead of a trap), that is
faster but possibly restricted in where they may be installed.
</p>
<a name="index-static-tracepoints"></a>
<a name="index-markers_002c-static-tracepoints"></a>
<a name="index-probing-markers_002c-static-tracepoints"></a>
<p>Regular and fast tracepoints are dynamic tracing facilities, meaning
that they can be used to insert tracepoints at (almost) any location
in the target.  Some targets may also support controlling <em>static
tracepoints</em> from <small>GDB</small>.  With static tracing, a set of
instrumentation points, also known as <em>markers</em>, are embedded in
the target program, and can be activated or deactivated by name or
address.  These are usually placed at locations which facilitate
investigating what the target is actually doing.  <small>GDB</small>’s
support for static tracing includes being able to list instrumentation
points, and attach them with <small>GDB</small> defined high level
tracepoints that expose the whole range of convenience of
<small>GDB</small>’s tracepoints support.  Namely, support for collecting
registers values and values of global or local (to the instrumentation
point) variables; tracepoint conditions and trace state variables.
The act of installing a <small>GDB</small> static tracepoint on an
instrumentation point, or marker, is referred to as <em>probing</em> a
static tracepoint marker.
</p>
<p><code>gdbserver</code> supports tracepoints on some target systems.
See <a href="#Server">Tracepoints support in <code>gdbserver</code></a>.
</p>
<p>This section describes commands to set tracepoints and associated
conditions and actions.

<h4>13.1.1 Create and Delete Tracepoints</h4>

<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-tracepoint"></a>
<a name="index-trace"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>trace <var>location</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>trace</code> command is very similar to the <code>break</code> command.
Its argument <var>location</var> can be any valid location.
See <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>.  The <code>trace</code> command defines a tracepoint,
which is a point in the target program where the debugger will briefly stop,
collect some data, and then allow the program to continue.  Setting a tracepoint
or changing its actions takes effect immediately if the remote stub
supports the ‘<samp>InstallInTrace</samp>’ feature (see <a href="#install-tracepoint-in-tracing">install tracepoint in tracing</a>).
If remote stub doesn’t support the ‘<samp>InstallInTrace</samp>’ feature, all
these changes don’t take effect until the next <code>tstart</code>
command, and once a trace experiment is running, further changes will
not have any effect until the next trace experiment starts.  In addition,
<small>GDB</small> supports <em>pending tracepoints</em>—tracepoints whose
address is not yet resolved.  (This is similar to pending breakpoints.)
Pending tracepoints are not downloaded to the target and not installed
until they are resolved.  The resolution of pending tracepoints requires
<small>GDB</small> support—when debugging with the remote target, and
<small>GDB</small> disconnects from the remote stub (see <a href="#disconnected-tracing">disconnected tracing</a>), pending tracepoints can not be resolved (and downloaded to
the remote stub) while <small>GDB</small> is disconnected.
</p>
<p>Here are some examples of using the <code>trace</code> command:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>trace foo.c:121</b>    // a source file and line number

(gdb) <b>trace +2</b>           // 2 lines forward

(gdb) <b>trace my_function</b>  // first source line of function

(gdb) <b>trace *my_function</b> // EXACT start address of function

(gdb) <b>trace *0x2117c4</b>    // an address
</pre></div>

<p>You can abbreviate <code>trace</code> as <code>tr</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>trace <var>location</var> if <var>cond</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set a tracepoint with condition <var>cond</var>; evaluate the expression
<var>cond</var> each time the tracepoint is reached, and collect data only
if the value is nonzero—that is, if <var>cond</var> evaluates as true.
See <a href="#Tracepoint-Conditions">Tracepoint Conditions</a>, for more
information on tracepoint conditions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ftrace <var>location</var> [ if <var>cond</var> ]</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-fast-tracepoint"></a>
<a name="index-fast-tracepoints_002c-setting"></a>
<a name="index-ftrace"></a>
<p>The <code>ftrace</code> command sets a fast tracepoint.  For targets that
support them, fast tracepoints will use a more efficient but possibly
less general technique to trigger data collection, such as a jump
instruction instead of a trap, or some sort of hardware support.  It
may not be possible to create a fast tracepoint at the desired
location, in which case the command will exit with an explanatory
message.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> handles arguments to <code>ftrace</code> exactly as for
<code>trace</code>.
</p>
<p>On 32-bit x86-architecture systems, fast tracepoints normally need to
be placed at an instruction that is 5 bytes or longer, but can be
placed at 4-byte instructions if the low 64K of memory of the target
program is available to install trampolines.  Some Unix-type systems,
such as <small>GNU</small>/Linux, exclude low addresses from the program’s
address space; but for instance with the Linux kernel it is possible
to let <small>GDB</small> use this area by doing a <code>sysctl</code> command
to set the <code>mmap_min_addr</code> kernel parameter, as in
</p>
<div>
<pre>sudo sysctl -w vm.mmap_min_addr=32768
</pre></div>

<p>which sets the low address to 32K, which leaves plenty of room for
trampolines.  The minimum address should be set to a page boundary.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>strace <var>location</var> [ if <var>cond</var> ]</code></dt>

<a name="index-static-tracepoints_002c-setting"></a>
<a name="index-probe-static-tracepoint-marker"></a>
<a name="index-strace"></a>
<p>The <code>strace</code> command sets a static tracepoint.  For targets that
support it, setting a static tracepoint probes a static
instrumentation point, or marker, found at <var>location</var>.  It may not
be possible to set a static tracepoint at the desired location, in
which case the command will exit with an explanatory message.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> handles arguments to <code>strace</code> exactly as for
<code>trace</code>, with the addition that the user can also specify
<code>-m <var>marker</var></code> as <var>location</var>.  This probes the marker
identified by the <var>marker</var> string identifier.  This identifier
depends on the static tracepoint backend library your program is
using.  You can find all the marker identifiers in the ‘<samp>ID</samp>’ field
of the <code>info static-tracepoint-markers</code> command output.
See <a href="#Listing-Static-Tracepoint-Markers">Listing Static Tracepoint
Markers</a>.  For example, in the following small program using the UST
tracing engine:
</p>
<div>
<pre>main ()
{
  trace_mark(ust, bar33, &#34;str %s&#34;, &#34;FOOBAZ&#34;);
}
</pre></div>

<p>the marker id is composed of joining the first two arguments to the
<code>trace_mark</code> call with a slash, which translates to:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) info static-tracepoint-markers
Cnt Enb ID         Address            What
1   n   ust/bar33  0x0000000000400ddc in main at stexample.c:22
         Data: &#34;str %s&#34;
[etc...]
</pre></div>

<p>so you may probe the marker above with:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) strace -m ust/bar33
</pre></div>

<p>Static tracepoints accept an extra collect action — <code>collect
$_sdata</code>.  This collects arbitrary user data passed in the probe point
call to the tracing library.  In the UST example above, you’ll see
that the third argument to <code>trace_mark</code> is a printf-like format
string.  The user data is then the result of running that formatting
string against the following arguments.  Note that <code>info
static-tracepoint-markers</code> command output lists that format string in
the ‘<samp>Data:</samp>’ field.
</p>
<p>You can inspect this data when analyzing the trace buffer, by printing
the $_sdata variable like any other variable available to
<small>GDB</small>.  See <a href="#Tracepoint-Actions">Tracepoint Action Lists</a>.

<a name="index-_0024tpnum"></a>
<a name="index-last-tracepoint-number"></a>
<a name="index-recent-tracepoint-number"></a>

<a name="index-delete-tracepoint"></a>

<dd><p>Permanently delete one or more tracepoints.  With no argument, the
default is to delete all tracepoints.  Note that the regular
<code>delete</code> command can remove tracepoints also.
</p>
<p>Examples:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>delete trace 1 2 3</b> // remove three tracepoints

(gdb) <b>delete trace</b>       // remove all tracepoints

<a name="Tracepoint-Conditions-1"></a>
<h4>13.1.4 Tracepoint Conditions</h4>
<a name="index-conditional-tracepoints"></a>
<a name="index-tracepoint-conditions"></a>

<p>The simplest sort of tracepoint collects data every time your program
reaches a specified place.  You can also specify a <em>condition</em> for
a tracepoint.  A condition is just a Boolean expression in your
programming language (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>).  A
tracepoint with a condition evaluates the expression each time your
program reaches it, and data collection happens only if the condition
is true.
</p>
<p>Tracepoint conditions can be specified when a tracepoint is set, by
using ‘<samp>if</samp>’ in the arguments to the <code>trace</code> command.
See <a href="#Create-and-Delete-Tracepoints">Setting Tracepoints</a>.  They can
also be set or changed at any time with the <code>condition</code> command,
just as with breakpoints.
</p>
<p>Unlike breakpoint conditions, <small>GDB</small> does not actually evaluate
the conditional expression itself.  Instead, <small>GDB</small> encodes the
expression into an agent expression (see <a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>)
suitable for execution on the target, independently of <small>GDB</small>.
Global variables become raw memory locations, locals become stack
accesses, and so forth.
</p>
<p>For instance, suppose you have a function that is usually called
frequently, but should not be called after an error has occurred.  You
could use the following tracepoint command to collect data about calls
of that function that happen while the error code is propagating
through the program; an unconditional tracepoint could end up
collecting thousands of useless trace frames that you would have to
search through.

<a name="Trace-State-Variables-1"></a>
<h4>13.1.5 Trace State Variables</h4>
<a name="index-trace-state-variables"></a>

<p>A <em>trace state variable</em> is a special type of variable that is
created and managed by target-side code.  The syntax is the same as
that for GDB’s convenience variables (a string prefixed with “$”),
but they are stored on the target.  They must be created explicitly,
using a <code>tvariable</code> command.  They are always 64-bit signed
integers.
</p>
<p>Trace state variables are remembered by <small>GDB</small>, and downloaded
to the target along with tracepoint information when the trace
experiment starts.  There are no intrinsic limits on the number of
trace state variables, beyond memory limitations of the target.
</p>
<a name="index-convenience-variables_002c-and-trace-state-variables"></a>
<p>Although trace state variables are managed by the target, you can use
them in print commands and expressions as if they were convenience
variables; <small>GDB</small> will get the current value from the target
while the trace experiment is running.  Trace state variables share
the same namespace as other “$” variables, which means that you
cannot have trace state variables with names like <code>$23</code> or
<code>$pc</code>, nor can you have a trace state variable and a convenience
variable with the same name.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>tvariable $<var>name</var> [ = <var>expression</var> ]</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-tvariable"></a>
<p>The <code>tvariable</code> command creates a new trace state variable named
<code>$<var>name</var></code>, and optionally gives it an initial value of
<var>expression</var>.  The <var>expression</var> is evaluated when this command is
entered; the result will be converted to an integer if possible,
otherwise <small>GDB</small> will report an error. A subsequent
<code>tvariable</code> command specifying the same name does not create a
variable, but instead assigns the supplied initial value to the
existing variable of that name, overwriting any previous initial
value. The default initial value is 0.

</dd>
<dt><code>actions <span>[</span><var>num</var><span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>This command will prompt for a list of actions to be taken when the
tracepoint is hit.  If the tracepoint number <var>num</var> is not
specified, this command sets the actions for the one that was most
recently defined (so that you can define a tracepoint and then say
<code>actions</code> without bothering about its number).  You specify the
actions themselves on the following lines, one action at a time, and
terminate the actions list with a line containing just <code>end</code>.  So
far, the only defined actions are <code>collect</code>, <code>teval</code>, and
<code>while-stepping</code>.
</p>
<p><code>actions</code> is actually equivalent to <code>commands</code> (see <a href="#Break-Commands">Breakpoint Command Lists</a>), except that only the defined
actions are allowed; any other <small>GDB</small> command is rejected.
</p>
<a name="index-remove-actions-from-a-tracepoint"></a>

<p>In the following example, the action list begins with <code>collect</code>
commands indicating the things to be collected when the tracepoint is
hit.  Then, in order to single-step and collect additional data
following the tracepoint, a <code>while-stepping</code> command is used,
followed by the list of things to be collected after each step in a
sequence of single steps.  The <code>while-stepping</code> command is
terminated by its own separate <code>end</code> command.  Lastly, the action
list is terminated by an <code>end</code> command.

<dd><p>Collect values of the given expressions when the tracepoint is hit.
This command accepts a comma-separated list of any valid expressions.
In addition to global, static, or local variables, the following
special arguments are supported:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>$regs</code></dt>
<dd><p>Collect all registers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>$args</code></dt>
<dd><p>Collect all function arguments.

<dd><p>Collect all local variables.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>$_ret</code></dt>
<dd><p>Collect the return address.  This is helpful if you want to see more
of a backtrace.
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> The return address location can not always be reliably
determined up front, and the wrong address / registers may end up
collected instead.  On some architectures the reliability is higher
for tracepoints at function entry, while on others it’s the opposite.
When this happens, backtracing will stop because the return address is
found unavailable (unless another collect rule happened to match it).
</p>

<dt><code>$_sdata</code></dt>

<p>Collect static tracepoint marker specific data.  Only available for
static tracepoints.  See <a href="#Tracepoint-Actions">Tracepoint Action
Lists</a>.  On the UST static tracepoints library backend, an
instrumentation point resembles a <code>printf</code> function call.  The
tracing library is able to collect user specified data formatted to a
character string using the format provided by the programmer that
instrumented the program.  Other backends have similar mechanisms.
Here’s an example of a UST marker call:
</p>
<div>
<pre> const char master_name[] = &#34;$your_name&#34;;
 trace_mark(channel1, marker1, &#34;hello %s&#34;, master_name)
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, collecting <code>$_sdata</code> collects the string
‘<samp>hello $yourname</samp>’.  When analyzing the trace buffer, you can
inspect ‘<samp>$_sdata</samp>’ like any other variable available to
<small>GDB</small>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>You can give several consecutive <code>collect</code> commands, each one
with a single argument, or one <code>collect</code> command with several
arguments separated by commas; the effect is the same.
</p>
<p>The optional <var>mods</var> changes the usual handling of the arguments.
<code>s</code> requests that pointers to chars be handled as strings, in
particular collecting the contents of the memory being pointed at, up
to the first zero.  The upper bound is by default the value of the
<code>print elements</code> variable; if <code>s</code> is followed by a decimal
number, that is the upper bound instead.  So for instance
‘<samp>collect/s25 mystr</samp>’ collects as many as 25 characters at
‘<samp>mystr</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The command <code>info scope</code> (see <a href="#Symbols">info scope</a>) is
particularly useful for figuring out what data to collect.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>teval <var>expr1</var>, <var>expr2</var>, …</code></dt>
<dd><p>Evaluate the given expressions when the tracepoint is hit.  This

are discarded, so this is mainly useful for assigning values to trace
state variables (see <a href="#Trace-State-Variables">Trace State Variables</a>) without adding those
values to the trace buffer, as would be the case if the <code>collect</code>
action were used.

</p>
<div>
<pre>&gt; while-stepping 12

<a name="disconnected-tracing"></a><a name="index-disconnected-tracing"></a>
<p>You can choose to continue running the trace experiment even if
<small>GDB</small> disconnects from the target, voluntarily or
involuntarily.  For commands such as <code>detach</code>, the debugger will
ask what you want to do with the trace.  But for unexpected
terminations (<small>GDB</small> crash, network outage), it would be
unfortunate to lose hard-won trace data, so the variable
<code>disconnected-tracing</code> lets you decide whether the trace should
continue running without <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set disconnected-tracing on</code></dt>
<dt><code>set disconnected-tracing off</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-disconnected_002dtracing"></a>
<p>Choose whether a tracing run should continue to run if <small>GDB</small>
has disconnected from the target.  Note that <code>detach</code> or
<code>quit</code> will ask you directly what to do about a running trace no
matter what this variable’s setting, so the variable is mainly useful
for handling unexpected situations, such as loss of the network.

<p>Show the current choice for disconnected tracing.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>When you reconnect to the target, the trace experiment may or may not
still be running; it might have filled the trace buffer in the
meantime, or stopped for one of the other reasons.  If it is running,
it will continue after reconnection.
</p>
<p>Upon reconnection, the target will upload information about the
tracepoints in effect.  <small>GDB</small> will then compare that
information to the set of tracepoints currently defined, and attempt
to match them up, allowing for the possibility that the numbers may
have changed due to creation and deletion in the meantime.  If one of
the target’s tracepoints does not match any in <small>GDB</small>, the
debugger will create a new tracepoint, so that you have a number with
which to specify that tracepoint.  This matching-up process is
necessarily heuristic, and it may result in useless tracepoints being
created; you may simply delete them if they are of no use.
</p>
<a name="index-circular-trace-buffer"></a>
<p>If your target agent supports a <em>circular trace buffer</em>, then you
can run a trace experiment indefinitely without filling the trace
buffer; when space runs out, the agent deletes already-collected trace
frames, oldest first, until there is enough room to continue
collecting.  This is especially useful if your tracepoints are being
hit too often, and your trace gets terminated prematurely because the
buffer is full.  To ask for a circular trace buffer, simply set
‘<samp>circular-trace-buffer</samp>’ to on.  You can set this at any time,
including during tracing; if the agent can do it, it will change
buffer handling on the fly, otherwise it will not take effect until
the next run.

<dt><code>set circular-trace-buffer on</code></dt>

<p>Choose whether a tracing run should use a linear or circular buffer

<a name="Tracepoint-Restrictions"></a>

<a name="Tracepoint-Restrictions-1"></a>
<h4>13.1.10 Tracepoint Restrictions</h4>

<a name="index-tracepoint-restrictions"></a>
<p>There are a number of restrictions on the use of tracepoints.  As
described above, tracepoint data gathering occurs on the target
without interaction from <small>GDB</small>.  Thus the full capabilities of
the debugger are not available during data gathering, and then at data
examination time, you will be limited by only having what was
collected.  The following items describe some common problems, but it
is not exhaustive, and you may run into additional difficulties not
mentioned here.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Tracepoint expressions are intended to gather objects (lvalues).  Thus
the full flexibility of GDB’s expression evaluator is not available.
You cannot call functions, cast objects to aggregate types, access
convenience variables or modify values (except by assignment to trace
state variables).  Some language features may implicitly call
functions (for instance Objective-C fields with accessors), and therefore
cannot be collected either.

</li><li> Collection of local variables, either individually or in bulk with
<code>$locals</code> or <code>$args</code>, during <code>while-stepping</code> may
behave erratically.  The stepping action may enter a new scope (for
instance by stepping into a function), or the location of the variable
may change (for instance it is loaded into a register).  The
tracepoint data recorded uses the location information for the
variables that is correct for the tracepoint location.  When the
tracepoint is created, it is not possible, in general, to determine
where the steps of a <code>while-stepping</code> sequence will advance the
program—particularly if a conditional branch is stepped.

</li><li> Collection of an incompletely-initialized or partially-destroyed object
may result in something that <small>GDB</small> cannot display, or displays
in a misleading way.

</li><li> When <small>GDB</small> displays a pointer to character it automatically
dereferences the pointer to also display characters of the string
being pointed to.  However, collecting the pointer during tracing does
not automatically collect the string.  You need to explicitly
dereference the pointer and provide size information if you want to
collect not only the pointer, but the memory pointed to.  For example,
<code>*ptr@50</code> can be used to collect the 50 element array pointed to
by <code>ptr</code>.

</li><li> It is not possible to collect a complete stack backtrace at a
tracepoint.  Instead, you may collect the registers and a few hundred
bytes from the stack pointer with something like <code>*(unsigned char *)$esp@300</code>
(adjust to use the name of the actual stack pointer register on your
target architecture, and the amount of stack you wish to capture).
Then the <code>backtrace</code> command will show a partial backtrace when
using a trace frame.  The number of stack frames that can be examined
depends on the sizes of the frames in the collected stack.  Note that
if you ask for a block so large that it goes past the bottom of the
stack, the target agent may report an error trying to read from an
invalid address.

</li><li> If you do not collect registers at a tracepoint, <small>GDB</small> can
infer that the value of <code>$pc</code> must be the same as the address of
the tracepoint and use that when you are looking at a trace frame
for that tracepoint.  However, this cannot work if the tracepoint has
multiple locations (for instance if it was set in a function that was
inlined), or if it has a <code>while-stepping</code> loop.  In those cases
<small>GDB</small> will warn you that it can’t infer <code>$pc</code>, and default
it to zero.

</li></ul>

<hr/>
<a name="Analyze-Collected-Data"></a>

<a name="Using-the-Collected-Data"></a>
<h3>13.2 Using the Collected Data</h3>

<p>After the tracepoint experiment ends, you use <small>GDB</small> commands
for examining the trace data.  The basic idea is that each tracepoint
collects a trace <em>snapshot</em> every time it is hit and another
snapshot every time it single-steps.  All these snapshots are
consecutively numbered from zero and go into a buffer, and you can
examine them later.  The way you examine them is to <em>focus</em> on a
specific trace snapshot.  When the remote stub is focused on a trace
snapshot, it will respond to all <small>GDB</small> requests for memory and
registers by reading from the buffer which belongs to that snapshot,
rather than from <em>real</em> memory or registers of the program being
debugged.  This means that <strong>all</strong> <small>GDB</small> commands
(<code>print</code>, <code>info registers</code>, <code>backtrace</code>, etc.) will
behave as if we were currently debugging the program state as it was
when the tracepoint occurred.  Any requests for data that are not in
the buffer will fail.

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tfind line <span>[</span><var>file</var>:<span>]</span><var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Find the next snapshot associated with the source line <var>n</var>.  If
the optional argument <var>file</var> is given, refer to line <var>n</var> in
that source file.  Search proceeds forward from the last examined
trace snapshot.  If no argument <var>n</var> is given, it means find the
next line other than the one currently being examined; thus saying
<code>tfind line</code> repeatedly can appear to have the same effect as
stepping from line to line in a <em>live</em> debugging session.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The default arguments for the <code>tfind</code> commands are specifically
designed to make it easy to scan through the trace buffer.  For
instance, <code>tfind</code> with no argument selects the next trace
snapshot, and <code>tfind -</code> with no argument selects the previous
trace snapshot.  So, by giving one <code>tfind</code> command, and then
simply hitting <tt>RET</tt> repeatedly you can examine all the trace
snapshots in order.  Or, by saying <code>tfind -</code> and then hitting
<tt>RET</tt> repeatedly you can examine the snapshots in reverse order.
The <code>tfind line</code> command with no argument selects the snapshot
for the next source line executed.  The <code>tfind pc</code> command with
no argument selects the next snapshot with the same program counter
(PC) as the current frame.  The <code>tfind tracepoint</code> command with
no argument selects the next trace snapshot collected by the same
tracepoint as the current one.
</p>
<p>In addition to letting you scan through the trace buffer manually,
these commands make it easy to construct <small>GDB</small> scripts that
scan through the trace buffer and print out whatever collected data
you are interested in.  Thus, if we want to examine the PC, FP, and SP
registers from each trace frame in the buffer, we can say this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>tfind start</b>
(gdb) <b>while ($trace_frame != -1)</b>
&gt; printf &#34;Frame %d, PC = %08X, SP = %08X, FP = %08X\n&#34;, \
          $trace_frame, $pc, $sp, $fp
&gt; tfind
&gt; end

Frame 0, PC = 0020DC64, SP = 0030BF3C, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 1, PC = 0020DC6C, SP = 0030BF38, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 2, PC = 0020DC70, SP = 0030BF34, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 3, PC = 0020DC74, SP = 0030BF30, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 4, PC = 0020DC78, SP = 0030BF2C, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 5, PC = 0020DC7C, SP = 0030BF28, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 6, PC = 0020DC80, SP = 0030BF24, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 7, PC = 0020DC84, SP = 0030BF20, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 8, PC = 0020DC88, SP = 0030BF1C, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 9, PC = 0020DC8E, SP = 0030BF18, FP = 0030BF44
Frame 10, PC = 00203F6C, SP = 0030BE3C, FP = 0030BF14
</pre></div>

<p>Or, if we want to examine the variable <code>X</code> at each source line in
the buffer:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>tfind start</b>
(gdb) <b>while ($trace_frame != -1)</b>
&gt; printf &#34;Frame %d, X == %d\n&#34;, $trace_frame, X
&gt; tfind line
&gt; end

Frame 0, X = 1
Frame 7, X = 2

<p><code>tdump</code> works by scanning the tracepoint’s current collection
actions and printing the value of each expression listed.  So
<code>tdump</code> can fail, if after a run, you change the tracepoint’s
actions to mention variables that were not collected during the run.
</p>
<p>Also, for tracepoints with <code>while-stepping</code> loops, <code>tdump</code>
uses the collected value of <code>$pc</code> to distinguish between trace
frames that were collected at the tracepoint hit, and frames that were
collected while stepping.  This allows it to correctly choose whether
to display the basic list of collections, or the collections from the
body of the while-stepping loop.  However, if <code>$pc</code> was not collected,
then <code>tdump</code> will always attempt to dump using the basic collection
list, and may fail if a while-stepping frame does not include all the
same data that is collected at the tracepoint hit.

<p>In some situations, the target running a trace experiment may no
longer be available; perhaps it crashed, or the hardware was needed
for a different activity.  To handle these cases, you can arrange to
dump the trace data into a file, and later use that file as a source
of trace data, via the <code>target tfile</code> command.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd>
<a name="index-tsave"></a>

<dt><code>tsave [ -r ] <var>filename</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>tsave [-ctf] <var>dirname</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Save the trace data to <var>filename</var>.  By default, this command
assumes that <var>filename</var> refers to the host filesystem, so if
necessary <small>GDB</small> will copy raw trace data up from the target and
then save it.  If the target supports it, you can also supply the
optional argument <code>-r</code> (“remote”) to direct the target to save
the data directly into <var>filename</var> in its own filesystem, which may be
more efficient if the trace buffer is very large.  (Note, however, that
<code>target tfile</code> can only read from files accessible to the host.)
By default, this command will save trace frame in tfile format.
You can supply the optional argument <code>-ctf</code> to save data in CTF
format.  The <em>Common Trace Format</em> (CTF) is proposed as a trace format
that can be shared by multiple debugging and tracing tools.  Please go to
‘<code>http://www.efficios.com/ctf</code>’ to get more information.

<h2>14 Debugging Programs That Use Overlays</h2>
<a name="index-overlays"></a>

<p>If your program is too large to fit completely in your target system’s
memory, you can sometimes use <em>overlays</em> to work around this
problem.  <small>GDB</small> provides some support for debugging programs that
use overlays.
</p>


<hr/>

<p>Suppose you have a computer whose instruction address space is only 64
kilobytes long, but which has much more memory which can be accessed by
other means: special instructions, segment registers, or memory
management hardware, for example.  Suppose further that you want to
adapt a program which is larger than 64 kilobytes to run on this system.
</p>
<p>One solution is to identify modules of your program which are relatively
independent, and need not call each other directly; call these modules
<em>overlays</em>.  Separate the overlays from the main program, and place
their machine code in the larger memory.  Place your main program in
instruction memory, but leave at least enough space there to hold the
largest overlay as well.
</p>
<p>Now, to call a function located in an overlay, you must first copy that
overlay’s machine code from the large memory into the space set aside
for it in the instruction memory, and then jump to its entry point
there.

</pre></div>

<p>The diagram (see <a href="#A-code-overlay">A code overlay</a>) shows a system with separate data
and instruction address spaces.  To map an overlay, the program copies
its code from the larger address space to the instruction address space.
Since the overlays shown here all use the same mapped address, only one
may be mapped at a time.  For a system with a single address space for
data and instructions, the diagram would be similar, except that the
program variables and heap would share an address space with the main
program and the overlay area.
</p>
<p>An overlay loaded into instruction memory and ready for use is called a
<em>mapped</em> overlay; its <em>mapped address</em> is its address in the
instruction memory.  An overlay not present (or only partially present)
in instruction memory is called <em>unmapped</em>; its <em>load address</em>
is its address in the larger memory.  The mapped address is also called
the <em>virtual memory address</em>, or <em>VMA</em>; the load address is also
called the <em>load memory address</em>, or <em>LMA</em>.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, overlays are not a completely transparent way to adapt a
program to limited instruction memory.  They introduce a new set of
global constraints you must keep in mind as you design your program:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Before calling or returning to a function in an overlay, your program
must make sure that overlay is actually mapped.  Otherwise, the call or
return will transfer control to the right address, but in the wrong
overlay, and your program will probably crash.

</li><li> If the process of mapping an overlay is expensive on your system, you
will need to choose your overlays carefully to minimize their effect on
your program’s performance.

</li><li> The executable file you load onto your system must contain each
overlay’s instructions, appearing at the overlay’s load address, not its
mapped address.  However, each overlay’s instructions must be relocated
and its symbols defined as if the overlay were at its mapped address.
You can use GNU linker scripts to specify different load and relocation
addresses for pieces of your program; see <a href="http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Overlay-Description.html#Overlay-Description">Overlay Description</a> in <cite>Using ld: the GNU linker</cite>.

</li><li> The procedure for loading executable files onto your system must be able
to load their contents into the larger address space as well as the
instruction and data spaces.

</li></ul>

<p>The overlay system described above is rather simple, and could be
improved in many ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If your system has suitable bank switch registers or memory management
hardware, you could use those facilities to make an overlay’s load area
contents simply appear at their mapped address in instruction space.
This would probably be faster than copying the overlay to its mapped
area in the usual way.

</li><li> If your overlays are small enough, you could set aside more than one
overlay area, and have more than one overlay mapped at a time.

</li><li> You can use overlays to manage data, as well as instructions.  In
general, data overlays are even less transparent to your design than
code overlays: whereas code overlays only require care when you call or
return to functions, data overlays require care every time you access
the data.  Also, if you change the contents of a data overlay, you
must copy its contents back out to its load address before you can copy a
different data overlay into the same mapped area.

</li></ul>

<h3>14.2 Overlay Commands</h3>

<p>To use <small>GDB</small>’s overlay support, each overlay in your program must
correspond to a separate section of the executable file.  The section’s
virtual memory address and load memory address must be the overlay’s
mapped and load addresses.  Identifying overlays with sections allows
<small>GDB</small> to determine the appropriate address of a function or
variable, depending on whether the overlay is mapped or not.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small>’s overlay commands all start with the word <code>overlay</code>;
you can abbreviate this as <code>ov</code> or <code>ovly</code>.  The commands are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>overlay off</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-overlay"></a>
<p>Disable <small>GDB</small>’s overlay support.  When overlay support is
disabled, <small>GDB</small> assumes that all functions and variables are
always present at their mapped addresses.  By default, <small>GDB</small>’s
overlay support is disabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>overlay manual</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-manual-overlay-debugging"></a>
<p>Enable <em>manual</em> overlay debugging.  In this mode, <small>GDB</small>
relies on you to tell it which overlays are mapped, and which are not,
using the <code>overlay map-overlay</code> and <code>overlay unmap-overlay</code>
commands described below.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>overlay map-overlay <var>overlay</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>overlay map <var>overlay</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-map-an-overlay"></a>
<p>Tell <small>GDB</small> that <var>overlay</var> is now mapped; <var>overlay</var> must
be the name of the object file section containing the overlay.  When an
overlay is mapped, <small>GDB</small> assumes it can find the overlay’s
functions and variables at their mapped addresses.  <small>GDB</small> assumes
that any other overlays whose mapped ranges overlap that of
<var>overlay</var> are now unmapped.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>overlay unmap-overlay <var>overlay</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>overlay unmap <var>overlay</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-unmap-an-overlay"></a>
<p>Tell <small>GDB</small> that <var>overlay</var> is no longer mapped; <var>overlay</var>
must be the name of the object file section containing the overlay.
When an overlay is unmapped, <small>GDB</small> assumes it can find the
overlay’s functions and variables at their load addresses.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>overlay auto</code></dt>
<dd><p>Enable <em>automatic</em> overlay debugging.  In this mode, <small>GDB</small>
consults a data structure the overlay manager maintains in the inferior
to see which overlays are mapped.  For details, see <a href="#Automatic-Overlay-Debugging">Automatic Overlay Debugging</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>overlay load-target</code></dt>
<dt><code>overlay load</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-reloading-the-overlay-table"></a>
<p>Re-read the overlay table from the inferior.  Normally, <small>GDB</small>
re-reads the table <small>GDB</small> automatically each time the inferior
stops, so this command should only be necessary if you have changed the
overlay mapping yourself using <small>GDB</small>.  This command is only
useful when using automatic overlay debugging.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>overlay list-overlays</code></dt>
<dt><code>overlay list</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-listing-mapped-overlays"></a>
<p>Display a list of the overlays currently mapped, along with their mapped
addresses, load addresses, and sizes.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Normally, when <small>GDB</small> prints a code address, it includes the name
of the function the address falls in:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print main
$3 = {int ()} 0x11a0 &lt;main&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>When overlay debugging is enabled, <small>GDB</small> recognizes code in
unmapped overlays, and prints the names of unmapped functions with
asterisks around them.  For example, if <code>foo</code> is a function in an
unmapped overlay, <small>GDB</small> prints it this way:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) overlay list
No sections are mapped.
(gdb) print foo
$5 = {int (int)} 0x100000 &lt;*foo*&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>When <code>foo</code>’s overlay is mapped, <small>GDB</small> prints the function’s
name normally:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) overlay list
Section .ov.foo.text, loaded at 0x100000 - 0x100034,
        mapped at 0x1016 - 0x104a
(gdb) print foo
$6 = {int (int)} 0x1016 &lt;foo&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>When overlay debugging is enabled, <small>GDB</small> can find the correct
address for functions and variables in an overlay, whether or not the
overlay is mapped.  This allows most <small>GDB</small> commands, like
<code>break</code> and <code>disassemble</code>, to work normally, even on unmapped
code.  However, <small>GDB</small>’s breakpoint support has some limitations:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a name="index-breakpoints-in-overlays"></a>
<a name="index-overlays_002c-setting-breakpoints-in"></a>
You can set breakpoints in functions in unmapped overlays, as long as
<small>GDB</small> can write to the overlay at its load address.
</li><li> <small>GDB</small> can not set hardware or simulator-based breakpoints in
unmapped overlays.  However, if you set a breakpoint at the end of your
overlay manager (and tell <small>GDB</small> which overlays are now mapped, if
you are using manual overlay management), <small>GDB</small> will re-set its
breakpoints properly.
</li></ul>

<a name="Automatic-Overlay-Debugging-1"></a>
<h3>14.3 Automatic Overlay Debugging</h3>
<a name="index-automatic-overlay-debugging"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> can automatically track which overlays are mapped and which
are not, given some simple co-operation from the overlay manager in the
inferior.  If you enable automatic overlay debugging with the
<code>overlay auto</code> command (see <a href="#Overlay-Commands">Overlay Commands</a>), <small>GDB</small>
looks in the inferior’s memory for certain variables describing the
current state of the overlays.
</p>
<p>Here are the variables your overlay manager must define to support
<small>GDB</small>’s automatic overlay debugging:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>_ovly_table</code>:</dt>
<dd><p>This variable must be an array of the following structures:
</p>
<div>
<pre>struct
{
  /* The overlay&#39;s mapped address.  */
  unsigned long vma;

  /* The size of the overlay, in bytes.  */
  unsigned long size;

  /* The overlay&#39;s load address.  */
  unsigned long lma;

  /* Non-zero if the overlay is currently mapped;
     zero otherwise.  */
  unsigned long mapped;
}
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>_novlys</code>:</dt>
<dd><p>This variable must be a four-byte signed integer, holding the total
number of elements in <code>_ovly_table</code>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>To decide whether a particular overlay is mapped or not, <small>GDB</small>
looks for an entry in <code><span>_ovly_table</span></code><!-- /@w --> whose <code>vma</code> and
<code>lma</code> members equal the VMA and LMA of the overlay’s section in the
executable file.  When <small>GDB</small> finds a matching entry, it consults
the entry’s <code>mapped</code> member to determine whether the overlay is
currently mapped.
</p>
<p>In addition, your overlay manager may define a function called
<code>_ovly_debug_event</code>.  If this function is defined, <small>GDB</small>
will silently set a breakpoint there.  If the overlay manager then
calls this function whenever it has changed the overlay table, this
will enable <small>GDB</small> to accurately keep track of which overlays
are in program memory, and update any breakpoints that may be set
in overlays.  This will allow breakpoints to work even if the
overlays are kept in ROM or other non-writable memory while they
are not being executed.

<a name="Overlay-Sample-Program"></a>

<a name="Overlay-Sample-Program-1"></a>
<h3>14.4 Overlay Sample Program</h3>
<a name="index-overlay-example-program"></a>

<p>When linking a program which uses overlays, you must place the overlays
at their load addresses, while relocating them to run at their mapped
addresses.  To do this, you must write a linker script (see <a href="http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Overlay-Description.html#Overlay-Description">Overlay
Description</a> in <cite>Using ld: the GNU linker</cite>).  Unfortunately,
since linker scripts are specific to a particular host system, target
architecture, and target memory layout, this manual cannot provide
portable sample code demonstrating <small>GDB</small>’s overlay support.
</p>
<p>However, the <small>GDB</small> source distribution does contain an overlaid
program, with linker scripts for a few systems, as part of its test
suite.  The program consists of the following files from
<samp>gdb/testsuite/gdb.base</samp>:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>overlays.c</samp></dt>
<dd><p>The main program file.
</p></dd>
<dt><samp>ovlymgr.c</samp></dt>
<dd><p>A simple overlay manager, used by <samp>overlays.c</samp>.
</p></dd>
<dt><samp>foo.c</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>bar.c</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>baz.c</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>grbx.c</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Overlay modules, loaded and used by <samp>overlays.c</samp>.
</p></dd>
<dt><samp>d10v.ld</samp></dt>
<dt><samp>m32r.ld</samp></dt>
<dd><p>Linker scripts for linking the test program on the <code>d10v-elf</code>
and <code>m32r-elf</code> targets.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>You can build the test program using the <code>d10v-elf</code> GCC
cross-compiler like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c overlays.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c ovlymgr.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c foo.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c bar.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c baz.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g -c grbx.c
$ d10v-elf-gcc -g overlays.o ovlymgr.o foo.o bar.o \
                  baz.o grbx.o -Wl,-Td10v.ld -o overlays
</pre></div>

<p>The build process is identical for any other architecture, except that
you must substitute the appropriate compiler and linker script for the
target system for <code>d10v-elf-gcc</code> and <code>d10v.ld</code>.

<a name="Using-GDB-with-Different-Languages"></a>
<h2>15 Using <small>GDB</small> with Different Languages</h2>
<a name="index-languages"></a>

<p>Although programming languages generally have common aspects, they are
rarely expressed in the same manner.  For instance, in ANSI C,
dereferencing a pointer <code>p</code> is accomplished by <code>*p</code>, but in
Modula-2, it is accomplished by <code>p^</code>.  Values can also be
represented (and displayed) differently.  Hex numbers in C appear as
‘<samp>0x1ae</samp>’, while in Modula-2 they appear as ‘<samp>1AEH</samp>’.
</p>
<a name="index-working-language"></a>
<p>Language-specific information is built into <small>GDB</small> for some languages,
allowing you to express operations like the above in your program’s
native language, and allowing <small>GDB</small> to output values in a manner
consistent with the syntax of your program’s native language.  The
language you use to build expressions is called the <em>working
language</em>.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Setting"></a>

<a name="Switching-Between-Source-Languages"></a>
<h3>15.1 Switching Between Source Languages</h3>

<p>There are two ways to control the working language—either have <small>GDB</small>
set it automatically, or select it manually yourself.  You can use the
<code>set language</code> command for either purpose.  On startup, <small>GDB</small>
defaults to setting the language automatically.  The working language is
used to determine how expressions you type are interpreted, how values
are printed, etc.
</p>
<p>In addition to the working language, every source file that
<small>GDB</small> knows about has its own working language.  For some object
file formats, the compiler might indicate which language a particular
source file is in.  However, most of the time <small>GDB</small> infers the
language from the name of the file.  The language of a source file
controls whether C<tt>++</tt> names are demangled—this way <code>backtrace</code> can
show each frame appropriately for its own language.  There is no way to
set the language of a source file from within <small>GDB</small>, but you can
set the language associated with a filename extension.  See <a href="#Show">Displaying the Language</a>.
</p>
<p>This is most commonly a problem when you use a program, such
as <code>cfront</code> or <code>f2c</code>, that generates C but is written in
another language.  In that case, make the
program use <code>#line</code> directives in its C output; that way
<small>GDB</small> will know the correct language of the source code of the original
program, and will display that source code, not the generated C code.
</p>

<h4>15.1.1 List of Filename Extensions and Languages</h4>

<p>If a source file name ends in one of the following extensions, then

</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<p>In addition, you may set the language associated with a filename
extension.  See <a href="#Show">Displaying the Language</a>.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Manually"></a>

<a name="Setting-the-Working-Language"></a>
<h4>15.1.2 Setting the Working Language</h4>

<p>If you allow <small>GDB</small> to set the language automatically,
expressions are interpreted the same way in your debugging session and
your program.
</p>
<a name="index-set-language"></a>
<p>If you wish, you may set the language manually.  To do this, issue the
command ‘<samp>set language <var>lang</var></samp>’, where <var>lang</var> is the name of
a language, such as
<code>c</code> or <code>modula-2</code>.
For a list of the supported languages, type ‘<samp>set language</samp>’.
</p>
<p>Setting the language manually prevents <small>GDB</small> from updating the working
language automatically.  This can lead to confusion if you try
to debug a program when the working language is not the same as the
source language, when an expression is acceptable to both
languages—but means different things.  For instance, if the current
source file were written in C, and <small>GDB</small> was parsing Modula-2, a
command such as:
</p>


<p>might not have the effect you intended.  In C, this means to add
<code>b</code> and <code>c</code> and place the result in <code>a</code>.  The result
printed would be the value of <code>a</code>.  In Modula-2, this means to compare
<code>a</code> to the result of <code>b+c</code>, yielding a <code>BOOLEAN</code> value.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Automatically"></a>

<a name="Having-GDB-Infer-the-Source-Language"></a>
<h4>15.1.3 Having <small>GDB</small> Infer the Source Language</h4>

<p>To have <small>GDB</small> set the working language automatically, use
‘<samp>set language local</samp>’ or ‘<samp>set language auto</samp>’.  <small>GDB</small>
then infers the working language.  That is, when your program stops in a
frame (usually by encountering a breakpoint), <small>GDB</small> sets the
working language to the language recorded for the function in that
frame.  If the language for a frame is unknown (that is, if the function
or block corresponding to the frame was defined in a source file that
does not have a recognized extension), the current working language is
not changed, and <small>GDB</small> issues a warning.
</p>
<p>This may not seem necessary for most programs, which are written
entirely in one source language.  However, program modules and libraries
written in one source language can be used by a main program written in
a different source language.  Using ‘<samp>set language auto</samp>’ in this
case frees you from having to set the working language manually.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Show"></a>

<a name="Displaying-the-Language"></a>
<h3>15.2 Displaying the Language</h3>

<p>The following commands help you find out which language is the
working language, and also what language source files were written in.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>show language</code></dt>
<dd><a name="show-language"></a><a name="index-show-language"></a>
<p>Display the current working language.  This is the

<a name="Checks"></a>

<a name="Type-and-Range-Checking"></a>
<h3>15.3 Type and Range Checking</h3>

<p>Some languages are designed to guard you against making seemingly common
errors through a series of compile- and run-time checks.  These include
checking the type of arguments to functions and operators and making
sure mathematical overflows are caught at run time.  Checks such as
these help to ensure a program’s correctness once it has been compiled
by eliminating type mismatches and providing active checks for range
errors when your program is running.
</p>
<p>By default <small>GDB</small> checks for these errors according to the
rules of the current source language.  Although <small>GDB</small> does not check
the statements in your program, it can check expressions entered directly
into <small>GDB</small> for evaluation via the <code>print</code> command, for example.
</p>


<a name="index-type-checking"></a>
<a name="index-checks_002c-type"></a>
<hr/>
<a name="Type-Checking"></a>

<a name="An-Overview-of-Type-Checking"></a>
<h4>15.3.1 An Overview of Type Checking</h4>

<p>Some languages, such as C and C<tt>++</tt>, are strongly typed, meaning that the
arguments to operators and functions have to be of the correct type,
otherwise an error occurs.  These checks prevent type mismatch
errors from ever causing any run-time problems.  For example,
</p>
<div>
<pre>int klass::my_method(char *b) { return  b ? 1 : 2; }

(gdb) print obj.my_method (0)
$1 = 2
</pre><pre>but
</pre><pre>(gdb) print obj.my_method (0x1234)
Cannot resolve method klass::my_method to any overloaded instance
</pre></div>

<p>The second example fails because in C<tt>++</tt> the integer constant
‘<samp>0x1234</samp>’ is not type-compatible with the pointer parameter type.
</p>
<p>For the expressions you use in <small>GDB</small> commands, you can tell
<small>GDB</small> to not enforce strict type checking or
to treat any mismatches as errors and abandon the expression;
When type checking is disabled, <small>GDB</small> successfully evaluates
expressions like the second example above.
</p>
<p>Even if type checking is off, there may be other reasons
related to type that prevent <small>GDB</small> from evaluating an expression.
For instance, <small>GDB</small> does not know how to add an <code>int</code> and
a <code>struct foo</code>.  These particular type errors have nothing to do
with the language in use and usually arise from expressions which make
little sense to evaluate anyway.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> provides some additional commands for controlling type checking:
</p>
<a name="index-set-check-type"></a>
<a name="index-show-check-type"></a>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set check type on</code></dt>
<dt><code>set check type off</code></dt>
<dd><p>Set strict type checking on or off.  If any type mismatches occur in
evaluating an expression while type checking is on, <small>GDB</small> prints a
message and aborts evaluation of the expression.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show check type</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show the current setting of type checking and whether <small>GDB</small>
is enforcing strict type checking rules.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-range-checking"></a>
<a name="index-checks_002c-range"></a>
<hr/>
<a name="Range-Checking"></a>

<a name="An-Overview-of-Range-Checking"></a>
<h4>15.3.2 An Overview of Range Checking</h4>

<p>In some languages (such as Modula-2), it is an error to exceed the
bounds of a type; this is enforced with run-time checks.  Such range
checking is meant to ensure program correctness by making sure
computations do not overflow, or indices on an array element access do
not exceed the bounds of the array.
</p>
<p>For expressions you use in <small>GDB</small> commands, you can tell
<small>GDB</small> to treat range errors in one of three ways: ignore them,
always treat them as errors and abandon the expression, or issue
warnings but evaluate the expression anyway.
</p>
<p>A range error can result from numerical overflow, from exceeding an
array index bound, or when you type a constant that is not a member
of any type.  Some languages, however, do not treat overflows as an
error.  In many implementations of C, mathematical overflow causes the
result to “wrap around” to lower values—for example, if <var>m</var> is
the largest integer value, and <var>s</var> is the smallest, then
</p>


<p>This, too, is specific to individual languages, and in some cases
specific to individual compilers or machines.  See <a href="#Supported-Languages">Supported Languages</a>, for further details on specific languages.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> provides some additional commands for controlling the range checker:
</p>
<a name="index-set-check-range"></a>
<a name="index-show-check-range"></a>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set check range auto</code></dt>
<dd><p>Set range checking on or off based on the current working language.
See <a href="#Supported-Languages">Supported Languages</a>, for the default settings for
each language.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set check range on</code></dt>
<dt><code>set check range off</code></dt>
<dd><p>Set range checking on or off, overriding the default setting for the
current working language.  A warning is issued if the setting does not
match the language default.  If a range error occurs and range checking is on,
then a message is printed and evaluation of the expression is aborted.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set check range warn</code></dt>
<dd><p>Output messages when the <small>GDB</small> range checker detects a range error,
but attempt to evaluate the expression anyway.  Evaluating the
expression may still be impossible for other reasons, such as accessing
memory that the process does not own (a typical example from many Unix
systems).

<h4>15.4.1.2 C and C<tt>++</tt> Constants</h4>

<a name="index-C-and-C_002b_002b-constants"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> allows you to express the constants of C and C<tt>++</tt> in the
following ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Integer constants are a sequence of digits.  Octal constants are
specified by a leading ‘<samp>0</samp>’ (i.e. zero), and hexadecimal constants
by a leading ‘<samp>0x</samp>’ or ‘<samp>0X</samp>’.  Constants may also end with a letter
‘<samp>l</samp>’, specifying that the constant should be treated as a
<code>long</code> value.

</li><li> Floating point constants are a sequence of digits, followed by a decimal
point, followed by a sequence of digits, and optionally followed by an
exponent.  An exponent is of the form:
‘<samp>e<span>[[</span>+<span>]|</span><span>-</span><span>]</span><var>nnn</var><!-- /@w --></samp>’, where <var>nnn</var> is another
sequence of digits.  The ‘<samp>+</samp>’ is optional for positive exponents.
A floating-point constant may also end with a letter ‘<samp>f</samp>’ or
‘<samp>F</samp>’, specifying that the constant should be treated as being of
the <code>float</code> (as opposed to the default <code>double</code>) type; or with
a letter ‘<samp>l</samp>’ or ‘<samp>L</samp>’, which specifies a <code>long double</code>
constant.

</li><li> Enumerated constants consist of enumerated identifiers, or their
integral equivalents.

</li><li> Character constants are a single character surrounded by single quotes
(<code>&#39;</code>), or a number—the ordinal value of the corresponding character
(usually its <small>ASCII</small> value).  Within quotes, the single character may
be represented by a letter or by <em>escape sequences</em>, which are of
the form ‘<samp>\<var>nnn</var></samp>’, where <var>nnn</var> is the octal representation
of the character’s ordinal value; or of the form ‘<samp>\<var>x</var></samp>’, where
‘<samp><var>x</var></samp>’ is a predefined special character—for example,
‘<samp>\n</samp>’ for newline.

<p>Wide character constants can be written by prefixing a character
constant with ‘<samp>L</samp>’, as in C.  For example, ‘<samp>L&#39;x&#39;</samp>’ is the wide
form of ‘<samp>x</samp>’.  The target wide character set is used when
computing the value of this constant (see <a href="#Character-Sets">Character Sets</a>).
</p>
</li><li> String constants are a sequence of character constants surrounded by
double quotes (<code>&#34;</code>).  Any valid character constant (as described
above) may appear.  Double quotes within the string must be preceded by
a backslash, so for instance ‘<samp>&#34;a\&#34;b&#39;c&#34;</samp>’ is a string of five
characters.

<p>Wide string constants can be written by prefixing a string constant
with ‘<samp>L</samp>’, as in C.  The target wide character set is used when
computing the value of this constant (see <a href="#Character-Sets">Character Sets</a>).
</p>
</li><li> Pointer constants are an integral value.  You can also write pointers
to constants using the C operator ‘<samp>&amp;</samp>’.

</li><li> Array constants are comma-separated lists surrounded by braces ‘<samp>{</samp>’
and ‘<samp>}</samp>’; for example, ‘<samp>{1,2,3}</samp>’ is a three-element array of
integers, ‘<samp>{{1,2}, {3,4}, {5,6}}</samp>’ is a three-by-two array,
and ‘<samp>{&amp;&#34;hi&#34;, &amp;&#34;there&#34;, &amp;&#34;fred&#34;}</samp>’ is a three-element array of pointers.
</li></ul>

<p><em>Warning:</em> <small>GDB</small> can only debug C<tt>++</tt> code if you use
the proper compiler and the proper debug format.  Currently,
<small>GDB</small> works best when debugging C<tt>++</tt> code that is compiled
with the most recent version of <small>GCC</small> possible.  The DWARF
debugging format is preferred; <small>GCC</small> defaults to this on most
popular platforms.  Other compilers and/or debug formats are likely to
work badly or not at all when using <small>GDB</small> to debug C<tt>++</tt>
code.  See <a href="#Compilation">Compilation</a>.
</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li> <a name="index-member-functions"></a>
Member function calls are allowed; you can use expressions like

<a name="index-namespace-in-C_002b_002b"></a>
While a member function is active (in the selected stack frame), your
expressions have the same namespace available as the member function;
that is, <small>GDB</small> allows implicit references to the class instance
pointer <code>this</code> following the same rules as C<tt>++</tt>.  <code>using</code>
declarations in the current scope are also respected by <small>GDB</small>.

</li><li> <a name="index-call-overloaded-functions"></a>
<a name="index-overloaded-functions_002c-calling"></a>
<a name="index-type-conversions-in-C_002b_002b"></a>
You can call overloaded functions; <small>GDB</small> resolves the function
call to the right definition, with some restrictions.  <small>GDB</small> does not
perform overload resolution involving user-defined type conversions,
calls to constructors, or instantiations of templates that do not exist
in the program.  It also cannot handle ellipsis argument lists or
default arguments.

<p>It does perform integral conversions and promotions, floating-point
promotions, arithmetic conversions, pointer conversions, conversions of
class objects to base classes, and standard conversions such as those of
functions or arrays to pointers; it requires an exact match on the
number of function arguments.
</p>
<p>Overload resolution is always performed, unless you have specified
<code>set overload-resolution off</code>.  See <a href="#Debugging-C-Plus-Plus"><small>GDB</small> Features for C<tt>++</tt></a>.
</p>
<p>You must specify <code>set overload-resolution off</code> in order to use an
explicit function signature to call an overloaded function, as in
</p><div>
<pre>p &#39;foo(char,int)&#39;(&#39;x&#39;, 13)
</pre></div>

<p>The <small>GDB</small> command-completion facility can simplify this;
see <a href="#Completion">Command Completion</a>.
</p>
</li><li> <a name="index-reference-declarations"></a>
<small>GDB</small> understands variables declared as C<tt>++</tt> lvalue or rvalue
references; you can use them in expressions just as you do in C<tt>++</tt>
source—they are automatically dereferenced.

<p>In the parameter list shown when <small>GDB</small> displays a frame, the values of
reference variables are not displayed (unlike other variables); this
avoids clutter, since references are often used for large structures.
The <em>address</em> of a reference variable is always shown, unless
you have specified ‘<samp>set print address off</samp>’.
</p>
</li><li> <small>GDB</small> supports the C<tt>++</tt> name resolution operator <code>::</code>—your
expressions can use it just as expressions in your program do.  Since
one scope may be defined in another, you can use <code>::</code> repeatedly if
necessary, for example in an expression like
‘<samp><var>scope1</var>::<var>scope2</var>::<var>name</var></samp>’.  <small>GDB</small> also allows
resolving name scope by reference to source files, in both C and C<tt>++</tt>
debugging (see <a href="#Variables">Program Variables</a>).

</li><li> <small>GDB</small> performs argument-dependent lookup, following the C<tt>++</tt>
specification.

<h4>15.4.1.4 C and C<tt>++</tt> Defaults</h4>

<a name="index-C-and-C_002b_002b-defaults"></a>

<p>If you allow <small>GDB</small> to set range checking automatically, it
defaults to <code>off</code> whenever the working language changes to
C or C<tt>++</tt>.  This happens regardless of whether you or <small>GDB</small>
selects the working language.
</p>
<p>If you allow <small>GDB</small> to set the language automatically, it
recognizes source files whose names end with <samp>.c</samp>, <samp>.C</samp>, or
<samp>.cc</samp>, etc, and when <small>GDB</small> enters code compiled from one of
these files, it sets the working language to C or C<tt>++</tt>.

<h4>15.4.1.5 C and C<tt>++</tt> Type and Range Checks</h4>

<a name="index-C-and-C_002b_002b-checks"></a>

<p>By default, when <small>GDB</small> parses C or C<tt>++</tt> expressions, strict type
checking is used.  However, if you turn type checking off, <small>GDB</small>
will allow certain non-standard conversions, such as promoting integer
constants to pointers.
</p>
<p>Range checking, if turned on, is done on mathematical operations.  Array
indices are not checked, since they are often used to index a pointer
that is not itself an array.

<dt><code><span>Breakpoints in functions with ABI tags</span></code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The GNU C<tt>++</tt> compiler introduced the notion of ABI “tags”, which
correspond to changes in the ABI of a type, function, or variable that
would not otherwise be reflected in a mangled name.  See
<a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2015/02/05/gcc5-and-the-c11-abi/">https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2015/02/05/gcc5-and-the-c11-abi/</a>
for more detail.
</p>
<p>The ABI tags are visible in C<tt>++</tt> demangled names.  For example, a
function that returns a std::string:
</p>
<div>
<pre>std::string function(int);
</pre></div>

<p>when compiled for the C++11 ABI is marked with the <code>cxx11</code> ABI
tag, and <small>GDB</small> displays the symbol like this:
</p>


<p>You can set a breakpoint on such functions simply as if they had no
tag.  For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) b function(int)
Breakpoint 2 at 0x40060d: file main.cc, line 10.
(gdb) info breakpoints
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address    What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x0040060d in function[abi:cxx11](int)
                                           at main.cc:10
</pre></div>

<p>On the rare occasion you need to disambiguate between different ABI
tags, you can do so by simply including the ABI tag in the function
name, like:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) b ambiguous[abi:other_tag](int)
</pre></div>
</dd>

<h4>15.4.1.8 Decimal Floating Point format</h4>
<a name="index-decimal-floating-point-format"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> can examine, set and perform computations with numbers in
decimal floating point format, which in the C language correspond to the
<code>_Decimal32</code>, <code>_Decimal64</code> and <code>_Decimal128</code> types as
specified by the extension to support decimal floating-point arithmetic.
</p>
<p>There are two encodings in use, depending on the architecture: BID (Binary
Integer Decimal) for x86 and x86-64, and DPD (Densely Packed Decimal) for
PowerPC and S/390.  <small>GDB</small> will use the appropriate encoding for the
configured target.
</p>
<p>Because of a limitation in <samp>libdecnumber</samp>, the library used by <small>GDB</small>
to manipulate decimal floating point numbers, it is not possible to convert
(using a cast, for example) integers wider than 32-bit to decimal float.
</p>
<p>In addition, in order to imitate <small>GDB</small>’s behaviour with binary floating
point computations, error checking in decimal float operations ignores
underflow, overflow and divide by zero exceptions.
</p>
<p>In the PowerPC architecture, <small>GDB</small> provides a set of pseudo-registers
to inspect <code>_Decimal128</code> values stored in floating point registers.

<a name="index-Objective_002dC"></a>
<p>This section provides information about some commands and command
options that are useful for debugging Objective-C code.  See also
<a href="#Symbols">info classes</a>, and <a href="#Symbols">info selectors</a>, for a
few more commands specific to Objective-C support.
</p>

<a name="Method-Names-in-Commands"></a>

<a name="Method-Names-in-Commands-1"></a>
<h4>15.4.4.1 Method Names in Commands</h4>

<p>The following commands have been extended to accept Objective-C method
names as line specifications:
</p>
<a name="index-clear_002c-and-Objective_002dC"></a>
<a name="index-break_002c-and-Objective_002dC"></a>
<a name="index-info-line_002c-and-Objective_002dC"></a>
<a name="index-jump_002c-and-Objective_002dC"></a>
<a name="index-list_002c-and-Objective_002dC"></a>
<ul>
<li> <code>clear</code>
</li><li> <code>break</code>
</li><li> <code>info line</code>
</li><li> <code>jump</code>
</li><li> <code>list</code>
</li></ul>

<p>A fully qualified Objective-C method name is specified as
</p>


<p>where the minus sign is used to indicate an instance method and a
plus sign (not shown) is used to indicate a class method.  The class
name <var>Class</var> and method name <var>methodName</var> are enclosed in
brackets, similar to the way messages are specified in Objective-C
source code.  For example, to set a breakpoint at the <code>create</code>
instance method of class <code>Fruit</code> in the program currently being
debugged, enter:
</p>


<p>To list ten program lines around the <code>initialize</code> class method,
enter:
</p>
<div>
<pre>list +[NSText initialize]
</pre></div>

<p>In the current version of <small>GDB</small>, the plus or minus sign is
required.  In future versions of <small>GDB</small>, the plus or minus
sign will be optional, but you can use it to narrow the search.  It
is also possible to specify just a method name:
</p>


<p>You must specify the complete method name, including any colons.  If
your program’s source files contain more than one <code>create</code> method,
you’ll be presented with a numbered list of classes that implement that
method.  Indicate your choice by number, or type ‘<samp>0</samp>’ to exit if
none apply.
</p>
<p>As another example, to clear a breakpoint established at the
<code>makeKeyAndOrderFront:</code> method of the <code>NSWindow</code> class, enter:
</p>
<div>
<pre>clear -[NSWindow makeKeyAndOrderFront:]
</pre></div>

<a name="index-_005fNSPrintForDebugger_002c-and-printing-Objective_002dC-objects"></a>
<p>will tell <small>GDB</small> to send the <code>hash</code> message to <var>object</var>
and print the result.  Also, an additional command has been added,
<code>print-object</code> or <code>po</code> for short, which is meant to print
the description of an object.  However, this command may only work
with certain Objective-C libraries that have a particular hook
function, <code>_NSPrintForDebugger</code>, defined.

<a name="Rust"></a>

<a name="Rust-1"></a>
<h4>15.4.8 Rust</h4>

<p><small>GDB</small> supports the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust
Programming Language</a>.  Type- and value-printing, and expression
parsing, are reasonably complete.  However, there are a few
peculiarities and holes to be aware of.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Linespecs (see <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>) are never relative to the current
crate.  Instead, they act as if there were a global namespace of
crates, somewhat similar to the way <code>extern crate</code> behaves.

<p>That is, if <small>GDB</small> is stopped at a breakpoint in a function in
crate ‘<samp>A</samp>’, module ‘<samp>B</samp>’, then <code>break B::f</code> will attempt
to set a breakpoint in a function named ‘<samp>f</samp>’ in a crate named
‘<samp>B</samp>’.
</p>
<p>As a consequence of this approach, linespecs also cannot refer to
items using ‘<samp>self::</samp>’ or ‘<samp>super::</samp>’.
</p>
</li><li> Because <small>GDB</small> implements Rust name-lookup semantics in
expressions, it will sometimes prepend the current crate to a name.
For example, if <small>GDB</small> is stopped at a breakpoint in the crate
‘<samp>K</samp>’, then <code>print ::x::y</code> will try to find the symbol
‘<samp>K::x::y</samp>’.

<p>However, since it is useful to be able to refer to other crates when
debugging, <small>GDB</small> provides the <code>extern</code> extension to
circumvent this.  To use the extension, just put <code>extern</code> before
a path expression to refer to the otherwise unavailable “global”
scope.
</p>
<p>In the above example, if you wanted to refer to the symbol ‘<samp>y</samp>’ in
the crate ‘<samp>x</samp>’, you would use <code>print extern x::y</code>.
</p>
</li><li> The Rust expression evaluator does not support “statement-like”
expressions such as <code>if</code> or <code>match</code>, or lambda expressions.

</li><li> Tuple expressions are not implemented.

</li><li> The Rust expression evaluator does not currently implement the
<code>Drop</code> trait.  Objects that may be created by the evaluator will
never be destroyed.

</li><li> <small>GDB</small> does not implement type inference for generics.  In order
to call generic functions or otherwise refer to generic items, you
will have to specify the type parameters manually.

</li><li> <small>GDB</small> currently uses the C<tt>++</tt> demangler for Rust.  In most
cases this does not cause any problems.  However, in an expression
context, completing a generic function name will give syntactically
invalid results.  This happens because Rust requires the ‘<samp>::</samp>’
operator between the function name and its generic arguments.  For
example, <small>GDB</small> might provide a completion like
<code>crate::f&lt;u32&gt;</code>, where the parser would require
<code>crate::f::&lt;u32&gt;</code>.

</li><li> As of this writing, the Rust compiler (version 1.8) has a few holes in
the debugging information it generates.  These holes prevent certain
features from being implemented by <small>GDB</small>:
<ul>
<li> Method calls cannot be made via traits.

</li><li> Operator overloading is not implemented.

</li><li> When debugging in a monomorphized function, you cannot use the generic
type names.

</li><li> The type <code>Self</code> is not available.

</li><li> <code>use</code> statements are not available, so some names may not be
available in the crate.

<p>Operators must be defined on values of specific types.  For instance,
<code>+</code> is defined on numbers, but not on structures.  Operators are
often defined on groups of types.  For the purposes of Modula-2, the
following definitions hold:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <em>Integral types</em> consist of <code>INTEGER</code>, <code>CARDINAL</code>, and
their subranges.

</li><li> <em>Character types</em> consist of <code>CHAR</code> and its subranges.

</li><li> <em>Floating-point types</em> consist of <code>REAL</code>.

</li><li> <em>Pointer types</em> consist of anything declared as <code>POINTER TO
<var>type</var></code>.

</li><li> <em>Scalar types</em> consist of all of the above.

</li><li> <em>Set types</em> consist of <code>SET</code> and <code>BITSET</code> types.

</li><li> <em>Boolean types</em> consist of <code>BOOLEAN</code>.

<ul>
<li> Integer constants are simply a sequence of digits.  When used in an
expression, a constant is interpreted to be type-compatible with the
rest of the expression.  Hexadecimal integers are specified by a
trailing ‘<samp>H</samp>’, and octal integers by a trailing ‘<samp>B</samp>’.

</li><li> Floating point constants appear as a sequence of digits, followed by a
decimal point and another sequence of digits.  An optional exponent can
then be specified, in the form ‘<samp>E<span>[</span>+<span>|</span>-<span>]</span><var>nnn</var></samp>’, where
‘<samp><span>[</span>+<span>|</span>-<span>]</span><var>nnn</var></samp>’ is the desired exponent.  All of the
digits of the floating point constant must be valid decimal (base 10)
digits.

</li><li> Character constants consist of a single character enclosed by a pair of
like quotes, either single (<code>&#39;</code>) or double (<code>&#34;</code>).  They may
also be expressed by their ordinal value (their <small>ASCII</small> value, usually)
followed by a ‘<samp>C</samp>’.

</li><li> String constants consist of a sequence of characters enclosed by a
pair of like quotes, either single (<code>&#39;</code>) or double (<code>&#34;</code>).
Escape sequences in the style of C are also allowed.  See <a href="#C-Constants">C and C<tt>++</tt> Constants</a>, for a brief explanation of escape
sequences.

</li><li> Enumerated constants consist of an enumerated identifier.

</li><li> Boolean constants consist of the identifiers <code>TRUE</code> and
<code>FALSE</code>.

</li><li> Pointer constants consist of integral values only.

</li><li> Set constants are not yet supported.

<h4>15.4.9.4 Modula-2 Types</h4>
<a name="index-Modula_002d2-types"></a>

<p>Currently <small>GDB</small> can print the following data types in Modula-2
syntax: array types, record types, set types, pointer types, procedure
types, enumerated types, subrange types and base types.  You can also
print the contents of variables declared using these type.
This section gives a number of simple source code examples together with
sample <small>GDB</small> sessions.
</p>
<p>The first example contains the following section of code:
</p>
<div>
<pre>VAR
   s: SET OF CHAR ;
   r: [20..40] ;
</pre></div>

<p>and you can request <small>GDB</small> to interrogate the type and value of
<code>r</code> and <code>s</code>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print s
{&#39;A&#39;..&#39;C&#39;, &#39;Z&#39;}
(gdb) ptype s
SET OF CHAR
(gdb) print r
21
(gdb) ptype r
[20..40]
</pre></div>

<p>Likewise if your source code declares <code>s</code> as:
</p>


<p>then you may query the type of <code>s</code> by:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) ptype s
type = SET [&#39;A&#39;..&#39;Z&#39;]
</pre></div>

<p>Note that at present you cannot interactively manipulate set
expressions using the debugger.
</p>
<p>The following example shows how you might declare an array in Modula-2
and how you can interact with <small>GDB</small> to print its type and contents:
</p>
<div>
<pre>VAR
   s: ARRAY [-10..10] OF CHAR ;
</pre></div>

<div>
<pre>(gdb) ptype s
ARRAY [-10..10] OF CHAR
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the array handling is not yet complete and although the type
is printed correctly, expression handling still assumes that all
arrays have a lower bound of zero and not <code>-10</code> as in the example
above.
</p>
<p>Here are some more type related Modula-2 examples:
</p>
<div>
<pre>TYPE
   colour = (blue, red, yellow, green) ;
   t = [blue..yellow] ;
VAR
   s: t ;
BEGIN
   s := blue ;
</pre></div>

<p>The <small>GDB</small> interaction shows how you can query the data type
and value of a variable.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print s
$1 = blue
(gdb) ptype t
type = [blue..yellow]
</pre></div>

<p>In this example a Modula-2 array is declared and its contents
displayed.  Observe that the contents are written in the same way as
their <code>C</code> counterparts.
</p>
<div>
<pre>VAR
   s: ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL ;
BEGIN
   s[1] := 1 ;
</pre></div>

<div>
<pre>(gdb) print s
$1 = {1, 0, 0, 0, 0}
(gdb) ptype s
type = ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL
</pre></div>

<p>The Modula-2 language interface to <small>GDB</small> also understands
pointer types as shown in this example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>VAR
   s: POINTER TO ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL ;
BEGIN
   NEW(s) ;
   s^[1] := 1 ;
</pre></div>

<p>and you can request that <small>GDB</small> describes the type of <code>s</code>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) ptype s
type = POINTER TO ARRAY [1..5] OF CARDINAL
</pre></div>

<p><small>GDB</small> handles compound types as we can see in this example.
Here we combine array types, record types, pointer types and subrange
types:
</p>
<div>
<pre>TYPE
   foo = RECORD
            f1: CARDINAL ;
            f2: CHAR ;
            f3: myarray ;
         END ;

   myarray = ARRAY myrange OF CARDINAL ;
   myrange = [-2..2] ;
VAR
   s: POINTER TO ARRAY myrange OF foo ;
</pre></div>

<p>and you can ask <small>GDB</small> to describe the type of <code>s</code> as shown
below.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) ptype s
type = POINTER TO ARRAY [-2..2] OF foo = RECORD
    f1 : CARDINAL;
    f2 : CHAR;
    f3 : ARRAY [-2..2] OF CARDINAL;
END 
</pre></div>

<h4>15.4.9.6 Deviations from Standard Modula-2</h4>
<a name="index-Modula_002d2_002c-deviations-from"></a>

<p>A few changes have been made to make Modula-2 programs easier to debug.
This is done primarily via loosening its type strictness:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Unlike in standard Modula-2, pointer constants can be formed by
integers.  This allows you to modify pointer variables during
debugging.  (In standard Modula-2, the actual address contained in a
pointer variable is hidden from you; it can only be modified
through direct assignment to another pointer variable or expression that
returned a pointer.)

</li><li> C escape sequences can be used in strings and characters to represent
non-printable characters.  <small>GDB</small> prints out strings with these
escape sequences embedded.  Single non-printable characters are
printed using the ‘<samp>CHR(<var>nnn</var>)</samp>’ format.

</li><li> The assignment operator (<code>:=</code>) returns the value of its right-hand
argument.

</li><li> All built-in procedures both modify <em>and</em> return their argument.
</li></ul>

<h4>15.4.9.7 Modula-2 Type and Range Checks</h4>
<a name="index-Modula_002d2-checks"></a>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Warning:</em> in this release, <small>GDB</small> does not yet perform type or
range checking.
</p></blockquote>

<p><small>GDB</small> considers two Modula-2 variables type equivalent if:
</p>
<ul>
<li> They are of types that have been declared equivalent via a <code>TYPE
<var>t1</var> = <var>t2</var></code> statement

</li><li> They have been declared on the same line.  (Note:  This is true of the
<small>GNU</small> Modula-2 compiler, but it may not be true of other compilers.)
</li></ul>

<p>As long as type checking is enabled, any attempt to combine variables
whose types are not equivalent is an error.
</p>
<p>Range checking is done on all mathematical operations, assignment, array
index bounds, and all built-in functions and procedures.

<p>There are a few subtle differences between the Modula-2 scope operator
(<code>.</code>) and the <small>GDB</small> scope operator (<code>::</code>).  The two have
similar syntax:
</p>


<p>where <var>scope</var> is the name of a module or a procedure,
<var>module</var> the name of a module, and <var>id</var> is any declared
identifier within your program, except another module.
</p>
<p>Using the <code>::</code> operator makes <small>GDB</small> search the scope
specified by <var>scope</var> for the identifier <var>id</var>.  If it is not
found in the specified scope, then <small>GDB</small> searches all scopes
enclosing the one specified by <var>scope</var>.
</p>
<p>Using the <code>.</code> operator makes <small>GDB</small> search the current scope for
the identifier specified by <var>id</var> that was imported from the
definition module specified by <var>module</var>.  With this operator, it is
an error if the identifier <var>id</var> was not imported from definition
module <var>module</var>, or if <var>id</var> is not an identifier in
<var>module</var>.

<h4>15.4.9.9 <small>GDB</small> and Modula-2</h4>

<p>Some <small>GDB</small> commands have little use when debugging Modula-2 programs.
Five subcommands of <code>set print</code> and <code>show print</code> apply
specifically to C and C<tt>++</tt>: ‘<samp>vtbl</samp>’, ‘<samp>demangle</samp>’,
‘<samp>asm-demangle</samp>’, ‘<samp>object</samp>’, and ‘<samp>union</samp>’.  The first four
apply to C<tt>++</tt>, and the last to the C <code>union</code> type, which has no direct
analogue in Modula-2.
</p>
<p>The <code>@</code> operator (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>), while available
with any language, is not useful with Modula-2.  Its
intent is to aid the debugging of <em>dynamic arrays</em>, which cannot be
created in Modula-2 as they can in C or C<tt>++</tt>.  However, because an
address can be specified by an integral constant, the construct
‘<samp>{<var>type</var>}<var>adrexp</var></samp>’ is still useful.
</p>
<a name="index-_0023-in-Modula_002d2"></a>

<h4>15.4.10 Ada</h4>
<a name="index-Ada"></a>

<p>The extensions made to <small>GDB</small> for Ada only support
output from the <small>GNU</small> Ada (GNAT) compiler.
Other Ada compilers are not currently supported, and
attempting to debug executables produced by them is most likely
to be difficult.
</p>

<a name="index-expressions-in-Ada"></a>


<hr/>
<a name="Ada-Mode-Intro"></a>

<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h4>15.4.10.1 Introduction</h4>
<a name="index-Ada-mode_002c-general"></a>

<p>The Ada mode of <small>GDB</small> supports a fairly large subset of Ada expression 
syntax, with some extensions.
The philosophy behind the design of this subset is 
</p>
<ul>
<li> That <small>GDB</small> should provide basic literals and access to operations for 
arithmetic, dereferencing, field selection, indexing, and subprogram calls, 
leaving more sophisticated computations to subprograms written into the
program (which therefore may be called from <small>GDB</small>).

</li><li> That type safety and strict adherence to Ada language restrictions
are not particularly important to the <small>GDB</small> user.

</li><li> That brevity is important to the <small>GDB</small> user.
</li></ul>

<p>Thus, for brevity, the debugger acts as if all names declared in
user-written packages are directly visible, even if they are not visible
according to Ada rules, thus making it unnecessary to fully qualify most
names with their packages, regardless of context.  Where this causes
ambiguity, <small>GDB</small> asks the user’s intent.
</p>
<p>The debugger will start in Ada mode if it detects an Ada main program. 
As for other languages, it will enter Ada mode when stopped in a program that
was translated from an Ada source file.
</p>
<p>While in Ada mode, you may use ‘<tt>--</tt>’ for comments.  This is useful 
mostly for documenting command files.  The standard <small>GDB</small> comment 
(‘<samp>#</samp>’) still works at the beginning of a line in Ada mode, but not in the 
middle (to allow based literals).

<a name="Omissions-from-Ada"></a>

<a name="Omissions-from-Ada-1"></a>
<h4>15.4.10.2 Omissions from Ada</h4>
<a name="index-Ada_002c-omissions-from"></a>

<p>Here are the notable omissions from the subset:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Only a subset of the attributes are supported:

<ul>
<li>- <tt>&#39;First</tt>, <tt>&#39;Last</tt>, and <tt>&#39;Length</tt>
 on array objects (not on types and subtypes).

</li><li>- <tt>&#39;Min</tt> and <tt>&#39;Max</tt>.  

</li><li>- <tt>&#39;Pos</tt> and <tt>&#39;Val</tt>. 

</li><li>- <tt>&#39;Tag</tt>.

</li><li>- <tt>&#39;Range</tt> on array objects (not subtypes), but only as the right
operand of the membership (<code>in</code>) operator.

</li><li>- <tt>&#39;Access</tt>, <tt>&#39;Unchecked_Access</tt>, and 
<tt>&#39;Unrestricted_Access</tt> (a GNAT extension).

</li><li>- <tt>&#39;Address</tt>.
</li></ul>

</li><li> The names in <code>Characters.Latin_1</code> are not available.

</li><li> Equality tests (‘<samp>=</samp>’ and ‘<samp>/=</samp>’) on arrays test for bitwise
equality of representations.  They will generally work correctly
for strings and arrays whose elements have integer or enumeration types.
They may not work correctly for arrays whose element
types have user-defined equality, for arrays of real values 
(in particular, IEEE-conformant floating point, because of negative
zeroes and NaNs), and for arrays whose elements contain unused bits with
indeterminate values.  

</li><li> The other component-by-component array operations (<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, 
<code>xor</code>, <code>not</code>, and relational tests other than equality)
are not implemented. 

</li><li> <a name="index-array-aggregates-_0028Ada_0029"></a>
<a name="index-record-aggregates-_0028Ada_0029"></a>
<a name="index-aggregates-_0028Ada_0029"></a>
There is limited support for array and record aggregates.  They are
permitted only on the right sides of assignments, as in these examples:

<div>
<pre>(gdb) set An_Array := (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
(gdb) set An_Array := (1, others =&gt; 0)
(gdb) set An_Array := (0|4 =&gt; 1, 1..3 =&gt; 2, 5 =&gt; 6)
(gdb) set A_2D_Array := ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))
(gdb) set A_Record := (1, &#34;Peter&#34;, True);
(gdb) set A_Record := (Name =&gt; &#34;Peter&#34;, Id =&gt; 1, Alive =&gt; True)
</pre></div>

<p>Changing a
discriminant’s value by assigning an aggregate has an
undefined effect if that discriminant is used within the record.
However, you can first modify discriminants by directly assigning to
them (which normally would not be allowed in Ada), and then performing an
aggregate assignment.  For example, given a variable <code>A_Rec</code> 
declared to have a type such as:
</p>
<div>
<pre>type Rec (Len : Small_Integer := 0) is record
    Id : Integer;
    Vals : IntArray (1 .. Len);
end record;
</pre></div>

<p>you can assign a value with a different size of <code>Vals</code> with two
assignments:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) set A_Rec.Len := 4
(gdb) set A_Rec := (Id =&gt; 42, Vals =&gt; (1, 2, 3, 4))
</pre></div>

<p>As this example also illustrates, <small>GDB</small> is very loose about the usual
rules concerning aggregates.  You may leave out some of the
components of an array or record aggregate (such as the <code>Len</code> 
component in the assignment to <code>A_Rec</code> above); they will retain their
original values upon assignment.  You may freely use dynamic values as
indices in component associations.  You may even use overlapping or
redundant component associations, although which component values are
assigned in such cases is not defined.
</p>
</li><li> Calls to dispatching subprograms are not implemented.

</li><li> The overloading algorithm is much more limited (i.e., less selective)
than that of real Ada.  It makes only limited use of the context in
which a subexpression appears to resolve its meaning, and it is much
looser in its rules for allowing type matches.  As a result, some
function calls will be ambiguous, and the user will be asked to choose
the proper resolution.

</li><li> The <code>new</code> operator is not implemented.

</li><li> Entry calls are not implemented.

</li><li> Aside from printing, arithmetic operations on the native VAX floating-point 
formats are not supported.

</li><li> It is not possible to slice a packed array.

</li><li> The names <code>True</code> and <code>False</code>, when not part of a qualified name, 
are interpreted as if implicitly prefixed by <code>Standard</code>, regardless of 
context.
Should your program
redefine these names in a package or procedure (at best a dubious practice),
you will have to use fully qualified names to access their new definitions.

</li><li> Based real literals are not implemented.
</li></ul>

<a name="Additions-to-Ada"></a>

<a name="Additions-to-Ada-1"></a>
<h4>15.4.10.3 Additions to Ada</h4>
<a name="index-Ada_002c-deviations-from"></a>

<p>As it does for other languages, <small>GDB</small> makes certain generic
extensions to Ada (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>):
</p>
<ul>
<li> If the expression <var>E</var> is a variable residing in memory (typically
a local variable or array element) and <var>N</var> is a positive integer,
then <code><var>E</var>@<var>N</var></code> displays the values of <var>E</var> and the
<var>N</var>-1 adjacent variables following it in memory as an array.  In
Ada, this operator is generally not necessary, since its prime use is
in displaying parts of an array, and slicing will usually do this in
Ada.  However, there are occasional uses when debugging programs in
which certain debugging information has been optimized away.

</li><li> <code><var>B</var>::<var>var</var></code> means “the variable named <var>var</var> that
appears in function or file <var>B</var>.”  When <var>B</var> is a file name,
you must typically surround it in single quotes.

</li><li> The expression <code>{<var>type</var>} <var>addr</var></code> means “the variable of type
<var>type</var> that appears at address <var>addr</var>.”

</li><li> A name starting with ‘<samp>$</samp>’ is a convenience variable 
(see <a href="#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Vars</a>) or a machine register (see <a href="#Registers">Registers</a>).
</li></ul>

<p>In addition, <small>GDB</small> provides a few other shortcuts and outright
additions specific to Ada:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The assignment statement is allowed as an expression, returning
its right-hand operand as its value.  Thus, you may enter

<div>
<pre>(gdb) set x := y + 3
(gdb) print A(tmp := y + 1)
</pre></div>

</li><li> The semicolon is allowed as an “operator,”  returning as its value 
the value of its right-hand operand.
This allows, for example,
complex conditional breaks:

<div>
<pre>(gdb) break f
(gdb) condition 1 (report(i); k += 1; A(k) &gt; 100)
</pre></div>

</li><li> An extension to based literals can be used to specify the exact byte
contents of a floating-point literal.  After the base, you can use
from zero to two ‘<samp>l</samp>’ characters, followed by an ‘<samp>f</samp>’.  The
number of ‘<samp>l</samp>’ characters controls the width of the resulting real
constant: zero means <code>Float</code> is used, one means
<code>Long_Float</code>, and two means <code>Long_Long_Float</code>.

<div>
<pre>(gdb) print 16f#41b80000#
$1 = 23.0
</pre></div>

</li><li> Rather than use catenation and symbolic character names to introduce special 
characters into strings, one may instead use a special bracket notation, 
which is also used to print strings.  A sequence of characters of the form 
‘<samp>[&#34;<var>XX</var>&#34;]</samp>’ within a string or character literal denotes the 
(single) character whose numeric encoding is <var>XX</var> in hexadecimal.  The
sequence of characters ‘<samp>[&#34;&#34;&#34;]</samp>’ also denotes a single quotation mark 
in strings.   For example,
<div>
<pre>   &#34;One line.[&#34;0a&#34;]Next line.[&#34;0a&#34;]&#34;
</pre></div>
<p>contains an ASCII newline character (<code>Ada.Characters.Latin_1.LF</code>)
after each period.
</p>
</li><li> The subtype used as a prefix for the attributes <tt>&#39;Pos</tt>, <tt>&#39;Min</tt>, and
<tt>&#39;Max</tt> is optional (and is ignored in any case).  For example, it is valid
to write



</li><li> When printing arrays, <small>GDB</small> uses positional notation when the 
array has a lower bound of 1, and uses a modified named notation otherwise.
For example, a one-dimensional array of three integers with a lower bound
of 3 might print as



<p>That is, in contrast to valid Ada, only the first component has a <code>=&gt;</code> 
clause.
</p>
</li><li> You may abbreviate attributes in expressions with any unique,
multi-character subsequence of 
their names (an exact match gets preference).
For example, you may use <tt>a&#39;len</tt>, <tt>a&#39;gth</tt>, or <tt>a&#39;lh</tt>
in place of  <tt>a&#39;length</tt>.

</li><li> <a name="index-quoting-Ada-internal-identifiers"></a>
Since Ada is case-insensitive, the debugger normally maps identifiers you type 
to lower case.  The GNAT compiler uses upper-case characters for 
some of its internal identifiers, which are normally of no interest to users.
For the rare occasions when you actually have to look at them,
enclose them in angle brackets to avoid the lower-case mapping. 
For example,
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print &lt;JMPBUF_SAVE&gt;[0]
</pre></div>

</li><li> Printing an object of class-wide type or dereferencing an 
access-to-class-wide value will display all the components of the object’s
specific type (as indicated by its run-time tag).  Likewise, component
selection on such a value will operate on the specific type of the
object.

</li></ul>

<a name="Overloading-support-for-Ada"></a>

<a name="Overloading-support-for-Ada-1"></a>
<h4>15.4.10.4 Overloading support for Ada</h4>
<a name="index-overloading_002c-Ada"></a>

<p>The debugger supports limited overloading.  Given a subprogram call in which
the function symbol has multiple definitions, it will use the number of
actual parameters and some information about their types to attempt to narrow
the set of definitions.  It also makes very limited use of context, preferring
procedures to functions in the context of the <code>call</code> command, and
functions to procedures elsewhere.
</p>
<p>If, after narrowing, the set of matching definitions still contains more than
one definition, <small>GDB</small> will display a menu to query which one it should
use, for instance:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print f(1)
Multiple matches for f
[0] cancel
[1] foo.f (integer) return boolean at foo.adb:23
[2] foo.f (foo.new_integer) return boolean at foo.adb:28
&gt; 
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, just select one menu entry either to cancel expression evaluation
(type <kbd>0</kbd> and press <tt>RET</tt>) or to continue evaluation with a specific
instance (type the corresponding number and press <tt>RET</tt>).
</p>
<p>Here are a couple of commands to customize <small>GDB</small>’s behavior in this
case:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd>
<a name="index-set-ada-print_002dsignatures"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set ada print-signatures</code></dt>
<dd><p>Control whether parameter types and return types are displayed in overloads
selection menus.  It is <code>on</code> by default.

<h4>15.4.10.5 Stopping at the Very Beginning</h4>

<a name="index-breakpointing-Ada-elaboration-code"></a>
<p>It is sometimes necessary to debug the program during elaboration, and
before reaching the main procedure.
As defined in the Ada Reference
Manual, the elaboration code is invoked from a procedure called
<code>adainit</code>.  To run your program up to the beginning of
elaboration, simply use the following two commands:
<code>tbreak adainit</code> and <code>run</code>.

<h4>15.4.10.6 Ada Exceptions</h4>

<p>A command is provided to list all Ada exceptions:
</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>info exceptions</code></dt>
<dt><code>info exceptions <var>regexp</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>info exceptions</code> command allows you to list all Ada exceptions

</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Below is a small example, showing how the command can be used, first
without argument, and next with a regular expression passed as an

<dd><p>The <code>task apply</code> command is the Ada tasking analogue of
<code>thread apply</code> (see <a href="#Threads">Threads</a>).  It allows you to apply the
named <var>command</var> to one or more tasks.  Specify the tasks that you
want affected using a list of task IDs, or specify <code>all</code> to apply
to all tasks.
</p>
<p>The <var>flag</var> arguments control what output to produce and how to
handle errors raised when applying <var>command</var> to a task.
<var>flag</var> must start with a <code>-</code> directly followed by one letter
in <code>qcs</code>.  If several flags are provided, they must be given
individually, such as <code>-c -q</code>.
</p>
<p>By default, <small>GDB</small> displays some task information before the

</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-c</code></dt>
<dd><p>The flag <code>-c</code>, which stands for ‘<samp>continue</samp>’, causes any

</p></dd>
<dt><code>-s</code></dt>
<dd><p>The flag <code>-s</code>, which stands for ‘<samp>silent</samp>’, causes any errors
or empty output produced by a <var>command</var> to be silently ignored.
That is, the execution continues, but the task information and errors

<p>These commands are like the <code>break … thread …</code>
command (see <a href="#Thread-Stops">Thread Stops</a>).  The
<var>location</var> argument specifies source lines, as described
in <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>.
</p>
<p>Use the qualifier ‘<samp>task <var>taskno</var></samp>’ with a breakpoint command
to specify that you only want <small>GDB</small> to stop the program when a
particular Ada task reaches this breakpoint.  The <var>taskno</var> is one of the
numeric task identifiers assigned by <small>GDB</small>, shown in the first
column of the ‘<samp>info tasks</samp>’ display.
</p>
<p>If you do not specify ‘<samp>task <var>taskno</var></samp>’ when you set a
breakpoint, the breakpoint applies to <em>all</em> tasks of your
program.
</p>
<p>You can use the <code>task</code> qualifier on conditional breakpoints as
well; in this case, place ‘<samp>task <var>taskno</var></samp>’ before the
breakpoint condition (before the <code>if</code>).

<h4>15.4.10.8 Tasking Support when Debugging Core Files</h4>
<a name="index-Ada-tasking-and-core-file-debugging"></a>

<p>When inspecting a core file, as opposed to debugging a live program,
tasking support may be limited or even unavailable, depending on
the platform being used.
For instance, on x86-linux, the list of tasks is available, but task
switching is not supported.
</p>
<p>On certain platforms, the debugger needs to perform some
memory writes in order to provide Ada tasking support.  When inspecting
a core file, this means that the core file must be opened with read-write
privileges, using the command ‘<samp>&#34;set write on&#34;</samp>’ (see <a href="#Patching">Patching</a>).
Under these circumstances, you should make a backup copy of the core
file before inspecting it with <small>GDB</small>.

<a name="index-Ada_002c-problems"></a>

<p>Besides the omissions listed previously (see <a href="#Omissions-from-Ada">Omissions from Ada</a>),
we know of several problems with and limitations of Ada mode in
<small>GDB</small>,
some of which will be fixed with planned future releases of the debugger 
and the GNU Ada compiler.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Static constants that the compiler chooses not to materialize as objects in 
storage are invisible to the debugger.

</li><li> Named parameter associations in function argument lists are ignored (the
argument lists are treated as positional).

</li><li> Many useful library packages are currently invisible to the debugger.

</li><li> Fixed-point arithmetic, conversions, input, and output is carried out using 
floating-point arithmetic, and may give results that only approximate those on 
the host machine.

</li><li> The GNAT compiler never generates the prefix <code>Standard</code> for any of 
the standard symbols defined by the Ada language.  <small>GDB</small> knows about 
this: it will strip the prefix from names when you use it, and will never
look for a name you have so qualified among local symbols, nor match against
symbols in other packages or subprograms.  If you have 
defined entities anywhere in your program other than parameters and 
local variables whose simple names match names in <code>Standard</code>, 
GNAT’s lack of qualification here can cause confusion.  When this happens,
you can usually resolve the confusion 
by qualifying the problematic names with package
<code>Standard</code> explicitly.  
</li></ul>

<p>Older versions of the compiler sometimes generate erroneous debugging
information, resulting in the debugger incorrectly printing the value
of affected entities.  In some cases, the debugger is able to work
around an issue automatically. In other cases, the debugger is able
to work around the issue, but the work-around has to be specifically
enabled.

This is the default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set ada trust-PAD-over-XVS off</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is related to the encoding using by the GNAT compiler.  If <small>GDB</small>

<a name="index-GNAT-descriptive-types"></a>
<a name="index-GNAT-encoding"></a>
<p>Internally, the debugger also relies on the compiler following a number
of conventions known as the ‘<samp>GNAT Encoding</samp>’, all documented in
<samp>gcc/ada/exp_dbug.ads</samp> in the GCC sources. This encoding describes
how the debugging information should be generated for certain types.
In particular, this convention makes use of <em>descriptive types</em>,
which are artificial types generated purely to help the debugger.
</p>
<p>These encodings were defined at a time when the debugging information
format used was not powerful enough to describe some of the more complex
types available in Ada.  Since DWARF allows us to express nearly all
Ada features, the long-term goal is to slowly replace these descriptive
types by their pure DWARF equivalent.  To facilitate that transition,
a new maintenance option is available to force the debugger to ignore
those descriptive types.  It allows the user to quickly evaluate how
well <small>GDB</small> works without them.

<small>GDB</small> also provides a pseudo-language, called <code>minimal</code>.
It does not represent a real programming language, but provides a set
of capabilities close to what the C or assembly languages provide.
This should allow most simple operations to be performed while debugging
an application that uses a language currently not supported by <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>If the language is set to <code>auto</code>, <small>GDB</small> will automatically
select this language if the current frame corresponds to an unsupported
language.

<h2>16 Examining the Symbol Table</h2>

<p>The commands described in this chapter allow you to inquire about the
symbols (names of variables, functions and types) defined in your
program.  This information is inherent in the text of your program and
does not change as your program executes.  <small>GDB</small> finds it in your
program’s symbol table, in the file indicated when you started <small>GDB</small>
(see <a href="#File-Options">Choosing Files</a>), or by one of the
file-management commands (see <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>).

<a name="index-symbol-names"></a>
<a name="index-names-of-symbols"></a>
<a name="index-quoting-names"></a>
<a name="quoting-names"></a><p>Occasionally, you may need to refer to symbols that contain unusual
characters, which <small>GDB</small> ordinarily treats as word delimiters.  The
most frequent case is in referring to static variables in other
source files (see <a href="#Variables">Program Variables</a>).  File names
are recorded in object files as debugging symbols, but <small>GDB</small> would
ordinarily parse a typical file name, like <samp>foo.c</samp>, as the three words
‘<samp>foo</samp>’ ‘<samp>.</samp>’ ‘<samp>c</samp>’.  To allow <small>GDB</small> to recognize
‘<samp>foo.c</samp>’ as a single symbol, enclose it in single quotes; for example,
</p>


<p>looks up the value of <code>x</code> in the scope of the file <samp>foo.c</samp>.

<a name="index-whatis"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>whatis[/<var>flags</var>] [<var>arg</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the data type of <var>arg</var>, which can be either an expression
or a name of a data type.  With no argument, print the data type of
<code>$</code>, the last value in the value history.
</p>
<p>If <var>arg</var> is an expression (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>), it
is not actually evaluated, and any side-effecting operations (such as
assignments or function calls) inside it do not take place.
</p>
<p>If <var>arg</var> is a variable or an expression, <code>whatis</code> prints its
literal type as it is used in the source code.  If the type was
defined using a <code>typedef</code>, <code>whatis</code> will <em>not</em> print
the data type underlying the <code>typedef</code>.  If the type of the
variable or the expression is a compound data type, such as
<code>struct</code> or  <code>class</code>, <code>whatis</code> never prints their
fields or methods.  It just prints the <code>struct</code>/<code>class</code>
name (a.k.a. its <em>tag</em>).  If you want to see the members of
such a compound data type, use <code>ptype</code>.
</p>
<p>If <var>arg</var> is a type name that was defined using <code>typedef</code>,
<code>whatis</code> <em>unrolls</em> only one level of that <code>typedef</code>.
Unrolling means that <code>whatis</code> will show the underlying type used
in the <code>typedef</code> declaration of <var>arg</var>.  However, if that
underlying type is also a <code>typedef</code>, <code>whatis</code> will not
unroll it.
</p>
<p>For C code, the type names may also have the form ‘<samp>class
<var>class-name</var></samp>’, ‘<samp>struct <var>struct-tag</var></samp>’, ‘<samp>union
<var>union-tag</var></samp>’ or ‘<samp>enum <var>enum-tag</var></samp>’.
</p>
<p><var>flags</var> can be used to modify how the type is displayed.
Available flags are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>r</code></dt>
<dd><p>Display in “raw” form.  Normally, <small>GDB</small> substitutes template
parameters and typedefs defined in a class when printing the class’
members.  The <code>/r</code> flag disables this.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>m</code></dt>
<dd><p>Do not print methods defined in the class.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>M</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print methods defined in the class.  This is the default, but the flag
exists in case you change the default with <code>set print type methods</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>t</code></dt>
<dd><p>Do not print typedefs defined in the class.  Note that this controls
whether the typedef definition itself is printed, not whether typedef
names are substituted when printing other types.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>T</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print typedefs defined in the class.  This is the default, but the flag
exists in case you change the default with <code>set print type typedefs</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>o</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the offsets and sizes of fields in a struct, similar to what the
<code>pahole</code> tool does.  This option implies the <code>/tm</code> flags.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>x</code></dt>
<dd><p>Use hexadecimal notation when printing offsets and sizes of fields in a
struct.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>d</code></dt>
<dd><p>Use decimal notation when printing offsets and sizes of fields in a
struct.
</p>
<p>For example, given the following declarations:
</p>
<div>
<pre>struct tuv
{
  int a1;
  char *a2;
  int a3;
};

struct xyz
{
  int f1;
  char f2;
  void *f3;
  struct tuv f4;
};

union qwe
{
  struct tuv fff1;
  struct xyz fff2;
};

struct tyu
{
  int a1 : 1;
  int a2 : 3;
  int a3 : 23;
  char a4 : 2;
  int64_t a5;
  int a6 : 5;
  int64_t a7 : 3;
};
</pre></div>

<p>Issuing a <kbd>ptype /o struct tuv</kbd> command would print:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) ptype /o struct tuv
/* offset      |    size */  type = struct tuv {
/*      0      |       4 */    int a1;
/* XXX  4-byte hole      */
/*      8      |       8 */    char *a2;
/*     16      |       4 */    int a3;

                               /* total size (bytes):   24 */
                             }
</pre></div>

<p>Notice the format of the first column of comments.  There, you can
find two parts separated by the ‘<samp>|</samp>’ character: the <em>offset</em>,
which indicates where the field is located inside the struct, in
bytes, and the <em>size</em> of the field.  Another interesting line is
the marker of a <em>hole</em> in the struct, indicating that it may be
possible to pack the struct and make it use less space by reorganizing
its fields.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to print offsets inside an union:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) ptype /o union qwe
/* offset      |    size */  type = union qwe {
/*                    24 */    struct tuv {
/*      0      |       4 */        int a1;
/* XXX  4-byte hole      */
/*      8      |       8 */        char *a2;
/*     16      |       4 */        int a3;

                                   /* total size (bytes):   24 */
                               } fff1;
/*                    40 */    struct xyz {
/*      0      |       4 */        int f1;
/*      4      |       1 */        char f2;
/* XXX  3-byte hole      */
/*      8      |       8 */        void *f3;
/*     16      |      24 */        struct tuv {
/*     16      |       4 */            int a1;
/* XXX  4-byte hole      */
/*     24      |       8 */            char *a2;
/*     32      |       4 */            int a3;

                                       /* total size (bytes):   24 */
                                   } f4;

                                   /* total size (bytes):   40 */
                               } fff2;

                               /* total size (bytes):   40 */
                             }
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, since <code>struct tuv</code> and <code>struct xyz</code> occupy the
same space (because we are dealing with an union), the offset is not
printed for them.  However, you can still examine the offset of each
of these structures’ fields.
</p>
<p>Another useful scenario is printing the offsets of a struct containing
bitfields:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) ptype /o struct tyu
/* offset      |    size */  type = struct tyu {
/*      0:31   |       4 */    int a1 : 1;
/*      0:28   |       4 */    int a2 : 3;
/*      0: 5   |       4 */    int a3 : 23;
/*      3: 3   |       1 */    signed char a4 : 2;
/* XXX  3-bit hole       */
/* XXX  4-byte hole      */
/*      8      |       8 */    int64_t a5;
/*     16: 0   |       4 */    int a6 : 5;
/*     16: 5   |       8 */    int64_t a7 : 3;
/* XXX  7-byte padding   */

                               /* total size (bytes):   24 */
                             }
</pre></div>

<p>Note how the offset information is now extended to also include the
first bit of the bitfield.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-ptype"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>ptype[/<var>flags</var>] [<var>arg</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><p><code>ptype</code> accepts the same arguments as <code>whatis</code>, but prints a
detailed description of the type, instead of just the name of the type.
See <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>.
</p>
<p>Contrary to <code>whatis</code>, <code>ptype</code> always unrolls any
<code>typedef</code>s in its argument declaration, whether the argument is
a variable, expression, or a data type.  This means that <code>ptype</code>
of a variable or an expression will not print literally its type as
present in the source code—use <code>whatis</code> for that.  <code>typedef</code>s at
the pointer or reference targets are also unrolled.  Only <code>typedef</code>s of
fields, methods and inner <code>class typedef</code>s of <code>struct</code>s,
<code>class</code>es and <code>union</code>s are not unrolled even with <code>ptype</code>.
</p>
<p>For example, for this variable declaration:
</p>
<div>
<pre>typedef double real_t;
struct complex { real_t real; double imag; };
typedef struct complex complex_t;
complex_t var;
real_t *real_pointer_var;
</pre></div>

<p>the two commands give this output:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) whatis var
type = complex_t
(gdb) ptype var
type = struct complex {
    real_t real;
    double imag;
}
(gdb) whatis complex_t
type = struct complex
(gdb) whatis struct complex
type = struct complex
(gdb) ptype struct complex
type = struct complex {
    real_t real;
    double imag;
}
(gdb) whatis real_pointer_var
type = real_t *
(gdb) ptype real_pointer_var
type = double *
</pre></div>

<p>As with <code>whatis</code>, using <code>ptype</code> without an argument refers to
the type of <code>$</code>, the last value in the value history.
</p>
<a name="index-incomplete-type"></a>
<p>Sometimes, programs use opaque data types or incomplete specifications
of complex data structure.  If the debug information included in the
program does not allow <small>GDB</small> to display a full declaration of
the data type, it will say ‘<samp>&lt;incomplete type&gt;</samp>’.  For example,
given these declarations:
</p>
<div>
<pre>    struct foo;
    struct foo *fooptr;
</pre></div>

<p>but no definition for <code>struct foo</code> itself, <small>GDB</small> will say:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  (gdb) ptype foo
  $1 = &lt;incomplete type&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>“Incomplete type” is C terminology for data types that are not
completely specified.
</p>
<a name="index-unknown-type"></a>
<p>Othertimes, information about a variable’s type is completely absent
from the debug information included in the program.  This most often
happens when the program or library where the variable is defined
includes no debug information at all.  <small>GDB</small> knows the variable
exists from inspecting the linker/loader symbol table (e.g., the ELF
dynamic symbol table), but such symbols do not contain type
information.  Inspecting the type of a (global) variable for which
<small>GDB</small> has no type information shows:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  (gdb) ptype var
  type = &lt;data variable, no debug info&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>See <a href="#Variables">no debug info variables</a>, for how to print the values
of such variables.
</p>
<a name="index-info-types"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>info types [-q] [<var>regexp</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print a brief description of all types whose names match the regular
expression <var>regexp</var> (or all types in your program, if you supply
no argument).  Each complete typename is matched as though it were a
complete line; thus, ‘<samp>i type value</samp>’ gives information on all
types in your program whose names include the string <code>value</code>, but
‘<samp>i type ^value$</samp>’ gives information only on types whose complete
name is <code>value</code>.
</p>
<p>In programs using different languages, <small>GDB</small> chooses the syntax
to print the type description according to the
‘<samp>set language</samp>’ value: using ‘<samp>set language auto</samp>’
(see <a href="#Automatically">Set Language Automatically</a>) means to use the
language of the type, other values mean to use
the manually specified language (see <a href="#Manually">Set Language Manually</a>).
</p>
<p>This command differs from <code>ptype</code> in two ways: first, like
<code>whatis</code>, it does not print a detailed description; second, it
lists all source files and line numbers where a type is defined.
</p>
<p>The output from ‘<samp>into types</samp>’ is proceeded with a header line
describing what types are being listed.  The optional flag ‘<samp>-q</samp>’,
which stands for ‘<samp>quiet</samp>’, disables printing this header
information.

<dd>

<p>With no options ‘<samp>info sources</samp>’ prints the names of all source
files in your program for which there is debugging information.  The
source files are presented based on a list of object files
(executables and libraries) currently loaded into <small>GDB</small>.  For
each object file all of the associated source files are listed.
</p>
<p>Each source file will only be printed once for each object file, but a
single source file can be repeated in the output if it is part of
multiple object files.
</p>
<p>If the optional <var>regexp</var> is provided, then only source files that
match the regular expression will be printed.  The matching is
case-sensitive, except on operating systems that have case-insensitive
filesystem (e.g., MS-Windows). ‘<samp>--</samp>’ can be used before
<var>regexp</var> to prevent <small>GDB</small> interpreting <var>regexp</var> as a
command option (e.g. if <var>regexp</var> starts with ‘<samp>-</samp>’).
</p>
<p>By default, the <var>regexp</var> is used to match anywhere in the
filename.  If <code>-dirname</code>, only files having a dirname matching
<var>regexp</var> are shown.  If <code>-basename</code>, only files having a
basename matching <var>regexp</var> are shown.
</p>
<p>It is possible that an object file may be printed in the list with no
associated source files.  This can happen when either no source files
match <var>regexp</var>, or, the object file was compiled without debug
information and so <small>GDB</small> is unable to find any source file
names.
</p>
<a name="index-info-functions"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>info functions [-q] [-n]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the names and data types of all defined functions.
Similarly to ‘<samp>info types</samp>’, this command groups its output by source
files and annotates each function definition with its source line
number.
</p>
<p>In programs using different languages, <small>GDB</small> chooses the syntax
to print the function name and type according to the
‘<samp>set language</samp>’ value: using ‘<samp>set language auto</samp>’
(see <a href="#Automatically">Set Language Automatically</a>) means to use the
language of the function, other values mean to use
the manually specified language (see <a href="#Manually">Set Language Manually</a>).
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>-n</samp>’ flag excludes <em>non-debugging symbols</em> from the
results.  A non-debugging symbol is a symbol that comes from the
executable’s symbol table, not from the debug information (for
example, DWARF) associated with the executable.
</p>
<p>The optional flag ‘<samp>-q</samp>’, which stands for ‘<samp>quiet</samp>’, disables
printing header information and messages explaining why no functions
have been printed.

<dd><p>Like ‘<samp>info functions</samp>’, but only print the names and data types
of the functions selected with the provided regexp(s).
</p>
<p>If <var>regexp</var> is provided, print only the functions whose names
match the regular expression <var>regexp</var>.
Thus, ‘<samp>info fun step</samp>’ finds all functions whose
names include <code>step</code>; ‘<samp>info fun ^step</samp>’ finds those whose names
start with <code>step</code>.  If a function name contains characters that
conflict with the regular expression language (e.g.
‘<samp>operator*()</samp>’), they may be quoted with a backslash.
</p>
<p>If <var>type_regexp</var> is provided, print only the functions whose
types, as printed by the <code>whatis</code> command, match
the regular expression <var>type_regexp</var>.
If <var>type_regexp</var> contains space(s), it should be enclosed in
quote characters.  If needed, use backslash to escape the meaning
of special characters or quotes.
Thus, ‘<samp>info fun -t &#39;^int (&#39;</samp>’ finds the functions that return
an integer; ‘<samp>info fun -t &#39;(.*int.*&#39;</samp>’ finds the functions that
have an argument type containing int; ‘<samp>info fun -t &#39;^int (&#39; ^step</samp>’
finds the functions whose names start with <code>step</code> and that return
int.
</p>
<p>If both <var>regexp</var> and <var>type_regexp</var> are provided, a function

<h2>17 Altering Execution</h2>

<p>Once you think you have found an error in your program, you might want to
find out for certain whether correcting the apparent error would lead to
correct results in the rest of the run.  You can find the answer by
experiment, using the <small>GDB</small> features for altering execution of the
program.
</p>
<p>For example, you can store new values into variables or memory
locations, give your program a signal, restart it at a different
address, or even return prematurely from a function.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Assignment"></a>

<a name="Assignment-to-Variables"></a>
<h3>17.1 Assignment to Variables</h3>

<a name="index-assignment"></a>
<a name="index-setting-variables"></a>
<p>To alter the value of a variable, evaluate an assignment expression.
See <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>.  For example,
</p>


<p>stores the value 4 into the variable <code>x</code>, and then prints the
value of the assignment expression (which is 4).
See <a href="#Languages">Using <small>GDB</small> with Different Languages</a>, for more
information on operators in supported languages.
</p>
<a name="index-set-variable"></a>
<a name="index-variables_002c-setting"></a>
<p>If you are not interested in seeing the value of the assignment, use the
<code>set</code> command instead of the <code>print</code> command.  <code>set</code> is
really the same as <code>print</code> except that the expression’s value is
not printed and is not put in the value history (see <a href="#Value-History">Value History</a>).  The expression is evaluated only for its effects.
</p>
<p>If the beginning of the argument string of the <code>set</code> command
appears identical to a <code>set</code> subcommand, use the <code>set
variable</code> command instead of just <code>set</code>.  This command is identical
to <code>set</code> except for its lack of subcommands.  For example, if your
program has a variable <code>width</code>, you get an error if you try to set
a new value with just ‘<samp>set width=13</samp>’, because <small>GDB</small> has the
command <code>set width</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) whatis width
type = double
(gdb) p width
$4 = 13
(gdb) set width=47
Invalid syntax in expression.
</pre></div>

<p>The invalid expression, of course, is ‘<samp>=47</samp>’.  In
order to actually set the program’s variable <code>width</code>, use
</p>


<p>Because the <code>set</code> command has many subcommands that can conflict
with the names of program variables, it is a good idea to use the
<code>set variable</code> command instead of just <code>set</code>.  For example, if
your program has a variable <code>g</code>, you run into problems if you try
to set a new value with just ‘<samp>set g=4</samp>’, because <small>GDB</small> has
the command <code>set gnutarget</code>, abbreviated <code>set g</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) whatis g
type = double
(gdb) p g
$1 = 1
(gdb) set g=4
(gdb) p g
$2 = 1
(gdb) r
The program being debugged has been started already.
Start it from the beginning? (y or n) y
Starting program: /home/smith/cc_progs/a.out
&#34;/home/smith/cc_progs/a.out&#34;: can&#39;t open to read symbols:
                                 Invalid bfd target.
(gdb) show g
The current BFD target is &#34;=4&#34;.
</pre></div>

<p>The program variable <code>g</code> did not change, and you silently set the
<code>gnutarget</code> to an invalid value.  In order to set the variable
<code>g</code>, use
</p>


<p><small>GDB</small> allows more implicit conversions in assignments than C; you can
freely store an integer value into a pointer variable or vice versa,
and you can convert any structure to any other structure that is the
same length or shorter.
</p>
<p>To store values into arbitrary places in memory, use the ‘<samp>{…}</samp>’
construct to generate a value of specified type at a specified address
(see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>).  For example, <code>{int}0x83040</code> refers
to memory location <code>0x83040</code> as an integer (which implies a certain size
and representation in memory), and
</p>


<p>stores the value 4 into that memory location.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Jumping"></a>

<a name="Continuing-at-a-Different-Address"></a>
<h3>17.2 Continuing at a Different Address</h3>

<p>Ordinarily, when you continue your program, you do so at the place where
it stopped, with the <code>continue</code> command.  You can instead continue at
an address of your own choosing, with the following commands:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-jump"></a>
<a name="index-j-_0028jump_0029"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>jump <var>location</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>j <var>location</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Resume execution at <var>location</var>.  Execution stops again immediately
if there is a breakpoint there.  See <a href="#Specify-Location">Specify Location</a>, for a description
of the different forms of <var>location</var>.  It is common
practice to use the <code>tbreak</code> command in conjunction with
<code>jump</code>.  See <a href="#Set-Breaks">Setting Breakpoints</a>.
</p>
<p>The <code>jump</code> command does not change the current stack frame, or
the stack pointer, or the contents of any memory location or any
register other than the program counter.  If <var>location</var> is in
a different function from the one currently executing, the results may
be bizarre if the two functions expect different patterns of arguments or
of local variables.  For this reason, the <code>jump</code> command requests
confirmation if the specified line is not in the function currently
executing.  However, even bizarre results are predictable if you are
well acquainted with the machine-language code of your program.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>On many systems, you can get much the same effect as the <code>jump</code>
command by storing a new value into the register <code>$pc</code>.  The
difference is that this does not start your program running; it only
changes the address of where it <em>will</em> run when you continue.  For
example,
</p>


<p>makes the next <code>continue</code> command or stepping command execute at
address <code>0x485</code>, rather than at the address where your program stopped.
See <a href="#Continuing-and-Stepping">Continuing and Stepping</a>.
</p>

signal <var>signal</var>.  The <var>signal</var> can be the name or the number of a
signal.  For example, on many systems <code>signal 2</code> and <code>signal
SIGINT</code> are both ways of sending an interrupt signal.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if <var>signal</var> is zero, continue execution without
giving a signal.  This is useful when your program stopped on account of
a signal and would ordinarily see the signal when resumed with the
<code>continue</code> command; ‘<samp>signal 0</samp>’ causes it to resume without a
signal.
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> When resuming a multi-threaded program, <var>signal</var> is
delivered to the currently selected thread, not the thread that last
reported a stop.  This includes the situation where a thread was
stopped due to a signal.  So if you want to continue execution
suppressing the signal that stopped a thread, you should select that
same thread before issuing the ‘<samp>signal 0</samp>’ command.  If you issue
the ‘<samp>signal 0</samp>’ command with another thread as the selected one,
<small>GDB</small> detects that and asks for confirmation.
</p>
<p>Invoking the <code>signal</code> command is not the same as invoking the
<code>kill</code> utility from the shell.  Sending a signal with <code>kill</code>
causes <small>GDB</small> to decide what to do with the signal depending on
the signal handling tables (see <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>).  The <code>signal</code> command
passes the signal directly to your program.

<p><code>signal</code> does not repeat when you press <tt>RET</tt> a second time

The handling of the signal must be set to pass the signal to the program,
otherwise <small>GDB</small> will report an error.
You can control the handling of signals from <small>GDB</small> with the
<code>handle</code> command (see <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>).
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if <var>signal</var> is zero, any currently queued signal
for the current thread is discarded and when execution resumes no signal
will be delivered.  This is useful when your program stopped on account
of a signal and would ordinarily see the signal when resumed with the
<code>continue</code> command.
</p>
<p>This command differs from the <code>signal</code> command in that the signal
is just queued, execution is not resumed.  And <code>queue-signal</code> cannot
be used to pass a signal whose handling state has been set to <code>nopass</code>
(see <a href="#Signals">Signals</a>).

<a name="Returning"></a>

<h3>17.4 Returning from a Function</h3>

<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-returning-from-a-function"></a>
<a name="index-return"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>return</code></dt>
<dt><code>return <var>expression</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>You can cancel execution of a function call with the <code>return</code>
command.  If you give an
<var>expression</var> argument, its value is used as the function’s return
value.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>When you use <code>return</code>, <small>GDB</small> discards the selected stack frame
(and all frames within it).  You can think of this as making the
discarded frame return prematurely.  If you wish to specify a value to
be returned, give that value as the argument to <code>return</code>.
</p>
<p>This pops the selected stack frame (see <a href="#Selection">Selecting a
Frame</a>), and any other frames inside of it, leaving its caller as the
innermost remaining frame.  That frame becomes selected.  The
specified value is stored in the registers used for returning values
of functions.
</p>
<p>The <code>return</code> command does not resume execution; it leaves the
program stopped in the state that would exist if the function had just
returned.  In contrast, the <code>finish</code> command (see <a href="#Continuing-and-Stepping">Continuing and Stepping</a>) resumes execution until the
selected stack frame returns naturally.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> needs to know how the <var>expression</var> argument should be set for
the inferior.  The concrete registers assignment depends on the OS ABI and the
type being returned by the selected stack frame.  For example it is common for
OS ABI to return floating point values in FPU registers while integer values in
CPU registers.  Still some ABIs return even floating point values in CPU
registers.  Larger integer widths (such as <code>long long int</code>) also have
specific placement rules.  <small>GDB</small> already knows the OS ABI from its
current target so it needs to find out also the type being returned to make the
assignment into the right register(s).
</p>
<p>Normally, the selected stack frame has debug info.  <small>GDB</small> will always
use the debug info instead of the implicit type of <var>expression</var> when the
debug info is available.  For example, if you type <kbd>return -1</kbd>, and the
function in the current stack frame is declared to return a <code>long long
int</code>, <small>GDB</small> transparently converts the implicit <code>int</code> value of -1
into a <code>long long int</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Breakpoint 1, func () at gdb.base/return-nodebug.c:29
29        return 31;
(gdb) return -1
Make func return now? (y or n) y
#0  0x004004f6 in main () at gdb.base/return-nodebug.c:43
43        printf (&#34;result=%lld\n&#34;, func ());
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<p>However, if the selected stack frame does not have a debug info, e.g., if the
function was compiled without debug info, <small>GDB</small> has to find out the type
to return from user.  Specifying a different type by mistake may set the value
in different inferior registers than the caller code expects.  For example,
typing <kbd>return -1</kbd> with its implicit type <code>int</code> would set only a part
of a <code>long long int</code> result for a debug info less function (on 32-bit
architectures).  Therefore the user is required to specify the return type by
an appropriate cast explicitly:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Breakpoint 2, 0x0040050b in func ()
(gdb) return -1
Return value type not available for selected stack frame.
Please use an explicit cast of the value to return.
(gdb) return (long long int) -1
Make selected stack frame return now? (y or n) y
#0  0x00400526 in main ()
(gdb)

<p>It is possible for the function you call via the <code>print</code> or

</p>
<p>Similarly, with a C<tt>++</tt> program it is possible for the function you
call via the <code>print</code> or <code>call</code> command to generate an
exception that is not handled due to the constraints of the dummy
frame.  In this case, any exception that is raised in the frame, but has
an out-of-frame exception handler will not be found.  GDB builds a
dummy-frame for the inferior function call, and the unwinder cannot
seek for exception handlers outside of this dummy-frame.  What happens
in that case is controlled by the

<a name="Calling-functions-with-no-debug-info"></a>
<h4>17.5.1 Calling functions with no debug info</h4>

<a name="index-no-debug-info-functions"></a>
<p>Sometimes, a function you wish to call is missing debug information.
In such case, <small>GDB</small> does not know the type of the function,
including the types of the function’s parameters.  To avoid calling
the inferior function incorrectly, which could result in the called
function functioning erroneously and even crash, <small>GDB</small> refuses
to call the function unless you tell it the type of the function.
</p>
<p>For prototyped (i.e. ANSI/ISO style) functions, there are two ways
to do that.  The simplest is to cast the call to the function’s
declared return type.  For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) p getenv (&#34;PATH&#34;)
&#39;getenv&#39; has unknown return type; cast the call to its declared return type
(gdb) p (char *) getenv (&#34;PATH&#34;)
$1 = 0x7fffffffe7ba &#34;/usr/local/bin:/&#34;...
</pre></div>

<p>Casting the return type of a no-debug function is equivalent to
casting the function to a pointer to a prototyped function that has a
prototype that matches the types of the passed-in arguments, and
calling that.  I.e., the call above is equivalent to:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) p ((char * (*) (const char *)) getenv) (&#34;PATH&#34;)
</pre></div>

<p>and given this prototyped C or C++ function with float parameters:
</p>
<div>
<pre>float multiply (float v1, float v2) { return v1 * v2; }
</pre></div>

<p>these calls are equivalent:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) p (float) multiply (2.0f, 3.0f)
(gdb) p ((float (*) (float, float)) multiply) (2.0f, 3.0f)
</pre></div>

<p>If the function you wish to call is declared as unprototyped (i.e.
old K&amp;R style), you must use the cast-to-function-pointer syntax, so
that <small>GDB</small> knows that it needs to apply default argument
promotions (promote float arguments to double).  See <a href="#ABI">float
promotion</a>.  For example, given this unprototyped C function with
float parameters, and no debug info:
</p>
<div>
<pre>float
multiply_noproto (v1, v2)
  float v1, v2;
{
  return v1 * v2;
}
</pre></div>

<p>you call it like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  (gdb) p ((float (*) ()) multiply_noproto) (2.0f, 3.0f)
</pre></div>

<a name="index-injecting-code"></a>
<a name="index-writing-into-executables-1"></a>
<a name="index-compiling-code"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> supports on-demand compilation and code injection into
programs running under <small>GDB</small>.  GCC 5.0 or higher built with
<samp>libcc1.so</samp> must be installed for this functionality to be enabled.
This functionality is implemented with the following commands.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-compile-code"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>compile code <var>source-code</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>compile code -raw <var>--</var> <var>source-code</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Compile <var>source-code</var> with the compiler language found as the current
language in <small>GDB</small> (see <a href="#Languages">Languages</a>).  If compilation and
injection is not supported with the current language specified in
<small>GDB</small>, or the compiler does not support this feature, an error
message will be printed.  If <var>source-code</var> compiles and links
successfully, <small>GDB</small> will load the object-code emitted,
and execute it within the context of the currently selected inferior.
It is important to note that the compiled code is executed immediately.
After execution, the compiled code is removed from <small>GDB</small> and any
new types or variables you have defined will be deleted.
</p>
<p>The command allows you to specify <var>source-code</var> in two ways.
The simplest method is to provide a single line of code to the command.
E.g.:
</p>
<div>
<pre>compile code printf (&#34;hello world\n&#34;);
</pre></div>

<p>If you specify options on the command line as well as source code, they
may conflict.  The ‘<samp>--</samp>’ delimiter can be used to separate options
from actual source code.  E.g.:
</p>
<div>
<pre>compile code -r -- printf (&#34;hello world\n&#34;);
</pre></div>

<p>Alternatively you can enter source code as multiple lines of text.  To
enter this mode, invoke the ‘<samp>compile code</samp>’ command without any text
following the command.  This will start the multiple-line editor and
allow you to type as many lines of source code as required.  When you
have completed typing, enter ‘<samp>end</samp>’ on its own line to exit the
editor.
</p>
<div>
<pre>compile code
&gt;printf (&#34;hello\n&#34;);
&gt;printf (&#34;world\n&#34;);
&gt;end
</pre></div>

<p>Specifying ‘<samp>-raw</samp>’, prohibits <small>GDB</small> from wrapping the
provided <var>source-code</var> in a callable scope.  In this case, you must
specify the entry point of the code by defining a function named
<code>_gdb_expr_</code>.  The ‘<samp>-raw</samp>’ code cannot access variables of the
inferior.  Using ‘<samp>-raw</samp>’ option may be needed for example when
<var>source-code</var> requires ‘<samp>#include</samp>’ lines which may conflict with
inferior symbols otherwise.

<h4>17.7.2 Caveats when using the <code>compile</code> command</h4>

<p>There are a few caveats to keep in mind when using the <code>compile</code>
command.  As the caveats are different per language, the table below
highlights specific issues on a per language basis.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>C code examples and caveats</dt>
<dd><p>When the language in <small>GDB</small> is set to ‘<samp>C</samp>’, the compiler will
attempt to compile the source code with a ‘<samp>C</samp>’ compiler.  The source
code provided to the <code>compile</code> command will have much the same
access to variables and types as it normally would if it were part of
the program currently being debugged in <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>Below is a sample program that forms the basis of the examples that
follow.  This program has been compiled and loaded into <small>GDB</small>,
much like any other normal debugging session.
</p>
<div>
<pre>void function1 (void)
{
   int i = 42;
   printf (&#34;function 1\n&#34;);
}

void function2 (void)
{
   int j = 12;
   function1 ();
}

int main(void)
{
   int k = 6;
   int *p;
   function2 ();
   return 0;
}
</pre></div>

<p>For the purposes of the examples in this section, the program above has
been compiled, loaded into <small>GDB</small>, stopped at the function
<code>main</code>, and <small>GDB</small> is awaiting input from the user.
</p>
<p>To access variables and types for any program in <small>GDB</small>, the
program must be compiled and packaged with debug information.  The
<code>compile</code> command is not an exception to this rule.  Without debug
information, you can still use the <code>compile</code> command, but you will
be very limited in what variables and types you can access.
</p>
<p>So with that in mind, the example above has been compiled with debug
information enabled.  The <code>compile</code> command will have access to
all variables and types (except those that may have been optimized
out).  Currently, as <small>GDB</small> has stopped the program in the
<code>main</code> function, the <code>compile</code> command would have access to
the variable <code>k</code>.  You could invoke the <code>compile</code> command
and type some source code to set the value of <code>k</code>.  You can also
read it, or do anything with that variable you would normally do in
<code>C</code>.  Be aware that changes to inferior variables in the
<code>compile</code> command are persistent.  In the following example:
</p>


<p>the variable <code>k</code> is now 3.  It will retain that value until
something else in the example program changes it, or another
<code>compile</code> command changes it.
</p>
<p>Normal scope and access rules apply to source code compiled and
injected by the <code>compile</code> command.  In the example, the variables
<code>j</code> and <code>k</code> are not accessible yet, because the program is
currently stopped in the <code>main</code> function, where these variables
are not in scope.  Therefore, the following command
</p>


<p>will result in a compilation error message.
</p>
<p>Once the program is continued, execution will bring these variables in
scope, and they will become accessible; then the code you specify via
the <code>compile</code> command will be able to access them.
</p>
<p>You can create variables and types with the <code>compile</code> command as
part of your source code.  Variables and types that are created as part
of the <code>compile</code> command are not visible to the rest of the program for
the duration of its run.  This example is valid:
</p>
<div>
<pre>compile code int ff = 5; printf (&#34;ff is %d\n&#34;, ff);
</pre></div>

<p>However, if you were to type the following into <small>GDB</small> after that
command has completed:
</p>
<div>
<pre>compile code printf (&#34;ff is %d\n&#39;&#39;, ff);
</pre></div>

<p>a compiler error would be raised as the variable <code>ff</code> no longer
exists.  Object code generated and injected by the <code>compile</code>
command is removed when its execution ends.  Caution is advised
when assigning to program variables values of variables created by the
code submitted to the <code>compile</code> command.  This example is valid:
</p>
<div>
<pre>compile code int ff = 5; k = ff;
</pre></div>

<p>The value of the variable <code>ff</code> is assigned to <code>k</code>.  The variable
<code>k</code> does not require the existence of <code>ff</code> to maintain the value
it has been assigned.  However, pointers require particular care in
assignment.  If the source code compiled with the <code>compile</code> command
changed the address of a pointer in the example program, perhaps to a
variable created in the <code>compile</code> command, that pointer would point
to an invalid location when the command exits.  The following example
would likely cause issues with your debugged program:
</p>
<div>
<pre>compile code int ff = 5; p = &amp;ff;
</pre></div>

<p>In this example, <code>p</code> would point to <code>ff</code> when the
<code>compile</code> command is executing the source code provided to it.
However, as variables in the (example) program persist with their
assigned values, the variable <code>p</code> would point to an invalid
location when the command exists.  A general rule should be followed
in that you should either assign <code>NULL</code> to any assigned pointers,
or restore a valid location to the pointer before the command exits.
</p>
<p>Similar caution must be exercised with any structs, unions, and typedefs
defined in <code>compile</code> command.  Types defined in the <code>compile</code>
command will no longer be available in the next <code>compile</code> command.
Therefore, if you cast a variable to a type defined in the
<code>compile</code> command, care must be taken to ensure that any future
need to resolve the type can be achieved.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) compile code static struct a { int a; } v = { 42 }; argv = &amp;v;
(gdb) compile code printf (&#34;%d\n&#34;, ((struct a *) argv)-&gt;a);
gdb command line:1:36: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type âstruct aâ
Compilation failed.
(gdb) compile code struct a { int a; }; printf (&#34;%d\n&#34;, ((struct a *) argv)-&gt;a);
42
</pre></div>

<p>Variables that have been optimized away by the compiler are not
accessible to the code submitted to the <code>compile</code> command.
Access to those variables will generate a compiler error which <small>GDB</small>
will print to the console.

<h4>17.7.3 Compiler search for the <code>compile</code> command</h4>

<p><small>GDB</small> needs to find <small>GCC</small> for the inferior being debugged
which may not be obvious for remote targets of different architecture
than where <small>GDB</small> is running.  Environment variable <code>PATH</code> on
<small>GDB</small> host is searched for <small>GCC</small> binary matching the
target architecture and operating system.  This search can be overriden
by <code>set compile-gcc</code> <small>GDB</small> command below.  <code>PATH</code> is
taken from shell that executed <small>GDB</small>, it is not the value set by
<small>GDB</small> command <code>set environment</code>).  See <a href="#Environment">Environment</a>.
</p>

<p>Specifically <code>PATH</code> is searched for binaries matching regular expression
<code><var>arch</var>(-[^-]*)?-<var>os</var>-gcc</code> according to the inferior target being
debugged.  <var>arch</var> is processor name — multiarch is supported, so for
example both <code>i386</code> and <code>x86_64</code> targets look for pattern
<code>(x86_64|i.86)</code> and both <code>s390</code> and <code>s390x</code> targets look
for pattern <code>s390x?</code>.  <var>os</var> is currently supported only for
pattern <code>linux(-gnu)?</code>.
</p>
<p>On Posix hosts the compiler driver <small>GDB</small> needs to find also
shared library <samp>libcc1.so</samp> from the compiler.  It is searched in
default shared library search path (overridable with usual environment
variable <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>), unrelated to <code>PATH</code> or <code>set
compile-gcc</code> settings.  Contrary to it <samp>libcc1plugin.so</samp> is found
according to the installation of the found compiler — as possibly
specified by the <code>set compile-gcc</code> command.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set compile-gcc</code></dt>

default.

<h2>18 <small>GDB</small> Files</h2>

<p><small>GDB</small> needs to know the file name of the program to be debugged,
both in order to read its symbol table and in order to start your
program.  To debug a core dump of a previous run, you must also tell
<small>GDB</small> the name of the core dump file.
</p>

<a name="Files"></a>

<a name="Commands-to-Specify-Files"></a>
<h3>18.1 Commands to Specify Files</h3>

<a name="index-symbol-table"></a>
<a name="index-core-dump-file"></a>

<p>You may want to specify executable and core dump file names.  The usual
way to do this is at start-up time, using the arguments to
<small>GDB</small>’s start-up commands (see <a href="#Invocation">Getting In and
Out of <small>GDB</small></a>).
</p>
<p>Occasionally it is necessary to change to a different file during a
<small>GDB</small> session.  Or you may run <small>GDB</small> and forget to
specify a file you want to use.  Or you are debugging a remote target
via <code>gdbserver</code> (see <a href="#Server">Using the <code>gdbserver</code>
Program</a>).  In these situations the <small>GDB</small> commands to specify
new files are useful.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-executable-file"></a>
<a name="index-file"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>file <var>filename</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Use <var>filename</var> as the program to be debugged.  It is read for its
symbols and for the contents of pure memory.  It is also the program
executed when you use the <code>run</code> command.  If you do not specify a
directory and the file is not found in the <small>GDB</small> working directory,
<small>GDB</small> uses the environment variable <code>PATH</code> as a list of
directories to search, just as the shell does when looking for a program
to run.  You can change the value of this variable, for both <small>GDB</small>
and your program, using the <code>path</code> command.
</p>
<a name="index-unlinked-object-files"></a>
<a name="index-patching-object-files"></a>
<p>You can load unlinked object <samp>.o</samp> files into <small>GDB</small> using
the <code>file</code> command.  You will not be able to “run” an object
file, but you can disassemble functions and inspect variables.  Also,
if the underlying BFD functionality supports it, you could use
<kbd>gdb -write</kbd> to patch object files using this technique.  Note
that <small>GDB</small> can neither interpret nor modify relocations in this
case, so branches and some initialized variables will appear to go to
the wrong place.  But this feature is still handy from time to time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>file</code></dt>
<dd><p><code>file</code> with no argument makes <small>GDB</small> discard any information it
has on both executable file and the symbol table.
</p>
<a name="index-exec_002dfile"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>exec-file <span>[</span> <var>filename</var> <span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specify that the program to be run (but not the symbol table) is found
in <var>filename</var>.  <small>GDB</small> searches the environment variable <code>PATH</code>
if necessary to locate your program.  Omitting <var>filename</var> means to
discard information on the executable file.
</p>
<a name="index-symbol_002dfile"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>symbol-file <span>[</span> <var>filename</var> <span>[</span> -o <var>offset</var> <span>]]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Read symbol table information from file <var>filename</var>.  <code>PATH</code> is
searched when necessary.  Use the <code>file</code> command to get both symbol
table and program to run from the same file.
</p>
<p>If an optional <var>offset</var> is specified, it is added to the start
address of each section in the symbol file.  This is useful if the
program is relocated at runtime, such as the Linux kernel with kASLR
enabled.
</p>
<p><code>symbol-file</code> with no argument clears out <small>GDB</small> information on your
program’s symbol table.
</p>
<p>The <code>symbol-file</code> command causes <small>GDB</small> to forget the contents of
some breakpoints and auto-display expressions.  This is because they may
contain pointers to the internal data recording symbols and data types,
which are part of the old symbol table data being discarded inside
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p><code>symbol-file</code> does not repeat if you press <tt>RET</tt> again after
executing it once.
</p>
<p>When <small>GDB</small> is configured for a particular environment, it
understands debugging information in whatever format is the standard
generated for that environment; you may use either a <small>GNU</small> compiler, or
other compilers that adhere to the local conventions.
Best results are usually obtained from <small>GNU</small> compilers; for example,
using <code><small>GCC</small></code> you can generate debugging information for
optimized code.
</p>
<p>For most kinds of object files, with the exception of old SVR3 systems
using COFF, the <code>symbol-file</code> command does not normally read the
symbol table in full right away.  Instead, it scans the symbol table
quickly to find which source files and which symbols are present.  The
details are read later, one source file at a time, as they are needed.
</p>
<p>The purpose of this two-stage reading strategy is to make <small>GDB</small>
start up faster.  For the most part, it is invisible except for
occasional pauses while the symbol table details for a particular source
file are being read.  (The <code>set verbose</code> command can turn these
pauses into messages if desired.  See <a href="#Messages_002fWarnings">Optional
Warnings and Messages</a>.)
</p>
<p>We have not implemented the two-stage strategy for COFF yet.  When the
symbol table is stored in COFF format, <code>symbol-file</code> reads the
symbol table data in full right away.  Note that “stabs-in-COFF”
still does the two-stage strategy, since the debug info is actually
in stabs format.

<p>Note that the core file is ignored when your program is actually running

<dd><p>The <code>add-symbol-file</code> command reads additional symbol table
information from the file <var>filename</var>.  You would use this command
when <var>filename</var> has been dynamically loaded (by some other means)
into the program that is running.  The <var>textaddress</var> parameter gives
the memory address at which the file’s text section has been loaded.
You can additionally specify the base address of other sections using
an arbitrary number of ‘<samp>-s <var>section</var> <var>address</var></samp>’ pairs.

<p>Although <var>filename</var> is typically a shared library file, an
executable file, or some other object file which has been fully
relocated for loading into a process, you can also load symbolic
information from relocatable <samp>.o</samp> files, as long as:
</p>
<ul>
<li> the file’s symbolic information refers only to linker symbols defined in
that file, not to symbols defined by other object files,
</li><li> every section the file’s symbolic information refers to has actually
been loaded into the inferior, as it appears in the file, and
</li><li> you can determine the address at which every section was loaded, and
provide these to the <code>add-symbol-file</code> command.
</li></ul>

<p>Some embedded operating systems, like Sun Chorus and VxWorks, can load
relocatable files into an already running program; such systems
typically make the requirements above easy to meet.  However, it’s
important to recognize that many native systems use complex link
procedures (<code>.linkonce</code> section factoring and C<tt>++</tt> constructor table
assembly, for example) that make the requirements difficult to meet.  In
general, one cannot assume that using <code>add-symbol-file</code> to read a
relocatable object file’s symbolic information will have the same effect
as linking the relocatable object file into the program in the normal
way.

<p>Sometimes you may wish that <small>GDB</small> stops and gives you control
when any of shared library events happen.  The best way to do this is
to use <code>catch load</code> and <code>catch unload</code> (see <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Set Catchpoints</a>).
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> also supports the <code>set stop-on-solib-events</code>
command for this.  This command exists for historical reasons.  It is
less useful than setting a catchpoint, because it does not allow for
conditions or commands as a catchpoint does.

<p>Shared libraries are also supported in many cross or remote debugging
configurations.  <small>GDB</small> needs to have access to the target’s libraries;
this can be accomplished either by providing copies of the libraries
on the host system, or by asking <small>GDB</small> to automatically retrieve the
libraries from the target.  If copies of the target libraries are
provided, they need to be the same as the target libraries, although the
copies on the target can be stripped as long as the copies on the host are
not.
</p>
<a name="index-where-to-look-for-shared-libraries"></a>
<p>For remote debugging, you need to tell <small>GDB</small> where the target
libraries are, so that it can load the correct copies—otherwise, it
may try to load the host’s libraries.  <small>GDB</small> has two variables
to specify the search directories for target libraries.

<a name="index-set-sysroot"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set sysroot <var>path</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Use <var>path</var> as the system root for the program being debugged.  Any
absolute shared library paths will be prefixed with <var>path</var>; many
runtime loaders store the absolute paths to the shared library in the
target program’s memory.  When starting processes remotely, and when
attaching to already-running processes (local or remote), their
executable filenames will be prefixed with <var>path</var> if reported to
<small>GDB</small> as absolute by the operating system.  If you use
<code>set sysroot</code> to find executables and shared libraries, they need
to be laid out in the same way that they are on the target, with
e.g. a <samp>/bin</samp>, <samp>/lib</samp> and <samp>/usr/lib</samp> hierarchy under
<var>path</var>.
</p>
<p>If <var>path</var> starts with the sequence <samp>target:</samp> and the target
system is remote then <small>GDB</small> will retrieve the target binaries
from the remote system.  This is only supported when using a remote
target that supports the <code>remote get</code> command (see <a href="#File-Transfer">Sending files to a remote system</a>).  The part of <var>path</var>
following the initial <samp>target:</samp> (if present) is used as system
root prefix on the remote file system.  If <var>path</var> starts with the
sequence <samp>remote:</samp> this is converted to the sequence
<samp>target:</samp> by <code>set sysroot</code><a name="DOCF15" href="#FOOT15"><sup>15</sup></a>.  If you want
to specify a local system root using a directory that happens to be
named <samp>target:</samp> or <samp>remote:</samp>, you need to use some
equivalent variant of the name like <samp>./target:</samp>.
</p>
<p>For targets with an MS-DOS based filesystem, such as MS-Windows,
<small>GDB</small> tries prefixing a few variants of the target
absolute file name with <var>path</var>.  But first, on Unix hosts,
<small>GDB</small> converts all backslash directory separators into forward
slashes, because the backslash is not a directory separator on Unix:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  c:\foo\bar.dll ⇒ c:/foo/bar.dll
</pre></div>

<p>Then, <small>GDB</small> attempts prefixing the target file name with
<var>path</var>, and looks for the resulting file name in the host file
system:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  c:/foo/bar.dll ⇒ /path/to/sysroot/c:/foo/bar.dll
</pre></div>

<p>If that does not find the binary, <small>GDB</small> tries removing
the ‘<samp>:</samp>’ character from the drive spec, both for convenience, and,
for the case of the host file system not supporting file names with
colons:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  c:/foo/bar.dll ⇒ /path/to/sysroot/c/foo/bar.dll
</pre></div>

<p>This makes it possible to have a system root that mirrors a target
with more than one drive.  E.g., you may want to setup your local
copies of the target system shared libraries like so (note ‘<samp>c</samp>’ vs
‘<samp>z</samp>’):
</p>
<div>
<pre> <samp>/path/to/sysroot/c/sys/bin/foo.dll</samp>
 <samp>/path/to/sysroot/c/sys/bin/bar.dll</samp>
 <samp>/path/to/sysroot/z/sys/bin/bar.dll</samp>
</pre></div>

<p>and point the system root at <samp>/path/to/sysroot</samp>, so that
<small>GDB</small> can find the correct copies of both
<samp>c:\sys\bin\foo.dll</samp>, and <samp>z:\sys\bin\bar.dll</samp>.
</p>
<p>If that still does not find the binary, <small>GDB</small> tries
removing the whole drive spec from the target file name:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  c:/foo/bar.dll ⇒ /path/to/sysroot/foo/bar.dll
</pre></div>

<p>This last lookup makes it possible to not care about the drive name,
if you don’t want or need to.

</p>
<p>Shared library file names as reported by the target system may not
make sense as is on the system <small>GDB</small> is running on.  For
example, when remote debugging a target that has MS-DOS based file
system semantics, from a Unix host, the target may be reporting to
<small>GDB</small> a list of loaded shared libraries with file names such as
<samp>c:\Windows\kernel32.dll</samp>.  On Unix hosts, there’s no concept of
drive letters, so the ‘<samp>c:\</samp>’ prefix is not normally understood as
indicating an absolute file name, and neither is the backslash
normally considered a directory separator character.  In that case,
the native file system would interpret this whole absolute file name
as a relative file name with no directory components.  This would make
it impossible to point <small>GDB</small> at a copy of the remote target’s
shared libraries on the host using <code>set sysroot</code>, and impractical
with <code>set solib-search-path</code>.  Setting
<code>target-file-system-kind</code> to <code>dos-based</code> tells <small>GDB</small>
to interpret such file names similarly to how the target would, and to
map them to file names valid on <small>GDB</small>’s native file system
semantics.  The value of <var>kind</var> can be <code>&#34;auto&#34;</code>, in addition
to one of the supported file system kinds.  In that case, <small>GDB</small>
tries to determine the appropriate file system variant based on the
current target’s operating system (see <a href="#ABI">Configuring the
Current ABI</a>).  The supported file system settings are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<dd><p>Instruct <small>GDB</small> to assume the target file system is of Unix

<a name="index-file-name-canonicalization"></a>
<a name="index-base-name-differences"></a>
<p>When processing file names provided by the user, <small>GDB</small>
frequently needs to compare them to the file names recorded in the
program’s debug info.  Normally, <small>GDB</small> compares just the
<em>base names</em> of the files as strings, which is reasonably fast
even for very large programs.  (The base name of a file is the last
portion of its name, after stripping all the leading directories.)
This shortcut in comparison is based upon the assumption that files
cannot have more than one base name.  This is usually true, but
references to files that use symlinks or similar filesystem
facilities violate that assumption.  If your program records files
using such facilities, or if you provide file names to <small>GDB</small>
using symlinks etc., you can set <code>basenames-may-differ</code> to
<code>true</code> to instruct <small>GDB</small> to completely canonicalize each
pair of file names it needs to compare.  This will make file-name
comparisons accurate, but at a price of a significant slowdown.

<a name="index-_002ebuild_002did-directory"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> allows you to put a program’s debugging information in a
file separate from the executable itself, in a way that allows
<small>GDB</small> to find and load the debugging information automatically.
Since debugging information can be very large—sometimes larger
than the executable code itself—some systems distribute debugging
information for their executables in separate files, which users can
install only when they need to debug a problem.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> supports two ways of specifying the separate debug info
file:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The executable contains a <em>debug link</em> that specifies the name of
the separate debug info file.  The separate debug file’s name is
usually <samp><var>executable</var>.debug</samp>, where <var>executable</var> is the
name of the corresponding executable file without leading directories
(e.g., <samp>ls.debug</samp> for <samp>/usr/bin/ls</samp>).  In addition, the
debug link specifies a 32-bit <em>Cyclic Redundancy Check</em> (CRC)
checksum for the debug file, which <small>GDB</small> uses to validate that
the executable and the debug file came from the same build.

</li><li> <a name="build-ID"></a>The executable contains a <em>build ID</em>, a unique bit string that is
also present in the corresponding debug info file.  (This is supported
only on some operating systems, when using the ELF or PE file formats
for binary files and the <small>GNU</small> Binutils.)  For more details about
this feature, see the description of the <samp>--build-id</samp>
command-line option in <a href="http://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/Options.html#Options">Command Line Options</a> in <cite>The GNU Linker</cite>.  The debug info file’s name is not specified
explicitly by the build ID, but can be computed from the build ID, see
below.
</li></ul>

<p>Depending on the way the debug info file is specified, <small>GDB</small>
uses two different methods of looking for the debug file:
</p>
<ul>
<li> For the “debug link” method, <small>GDB</small> looks up the named file in
the directory of the executable file, then in a subdirectory of that
directory named <samp>.debug</samp>, and finally under each one of the
global debug directories, in a subdirectory whose name is identical to
the leading directories of the executable’s absolute file name.  (On
MS-Windows/MS-DOS, the drive letter of the executable’s leading
directories is converted to a one-letter subdirectory, i.e.
<samp>d:/usr/bin/</samp> is converted to <samp>/d/usr/bin/</samp>, because Windows
filesystems disallow colons in file names.)

</li><li> For the “build ID” method, <small>GDB</small> looks in the
<samp>.build-id</samp> subdirectory of each one of the global debug directories for
a file named <samp><var>nn</var>/<var>nnnnnnnn</var>.debug</samp>, where <var>nn</var> are the
first 2 hex characters of the build ID bit string, and <var>nnnnnnnn</var>
are the rest of the bit string.  (Real build ID strings are 32 or more
hex characters, not 10.)  <small>GDB</small> can automatically query
<code>debuginfod</code> servers using build IDs in order to download separate debug
files that cannot be found locally.  For more information see <a href="#Debuginfod">Debuginfod</a>.
</li></ul>

<p>So, for example, suppose you ask <small>GDB</small> to debug
<samp>/usr/bin/ls</samp>, which has a debug link that specifies the
file <samp>ls.debug</samp>, and a build ID whose value in hex is
<code>abcdef1234</code>.  If the list of the global debug directories includes
<samp>/usr/lib/debug</samp>, then <small>GDB</small> will look for the following
debug information files, in the indicated order:
</p>
<ul>
<li>- <samp>/usr/lib/debug/.build-id/ab/cdef1234.debug</samp>
</li><li>- <samp>/usr/bin/ls.debug</samp>
</li><li>- <samp>/usr/bin/.debug/ls.debug</samp>
</li><li>- <samp>/usr/lib/debug/usr/bin/ls.debug</samp>.
</li></ul>

<p>If the debug file still has not been found and <code>debuginfod</code>
(see <a href="#Debuginfod">Debuginfod</a>) is enabled, <small>GDB</small> will attempt to download the
file from <code>debuginfod</code> servers.
</p>
<a name="debug_002dfile_002ddirectory"></a><p>Global debugging info directories default to what is set by <small>GDB</small>
configure option <samp>--with-separate-debug-dir</samp>.  During <small>GDB</small> run
you can also set the global debugging info directories, and view the list
<small>GDB</small> is currently using.

<a name="index-_002egnu_005fdebuglink-sections"></a>
<a name="index-debug-link-sections"></a>
<p>A debug link is a special section of the executable file named
<code>.gnu_debuglink</code>.  The section must contain:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A filename, with any leading directory components removed, followed by
a zero byte,
</li><li> zero to three bytes of padding, as needed to reach the next four-byte
boundary within the section, and
</li><li> a four-byte CRC checksum, stored in the same endianness used for the
executable file itself.  The checksum is computed on the debugging
information file’s full contents by the function given below, passing
zero as the <var>crc</var> argument.
</li></ul>

<p>Any executable file format can carry a debug link, as long as it can
contain a section named <code>.gnu_debuglink</code> with the contents
described above.
</p>
<a name="index-_002enote_002egnu_002ebuild_002did-sections"></a>
<a name="index-build-ID-sections"></a>
<p>The build ID is a special section in the executable file (and in other
ELF binary files that <small>GDB</small> may consider).  This section is
often named <code>.note.gnu.build-id</code>, but that name is not mandatory.
It contains unique identification for the built files—the ID remains
the same across multiple builds of the same build tree.  The default
algorithm SHA1 produces 160 bits (40 hexadecimal characters) of the
content for the build ID string.  The same section with an identical
value is present in the original built binary with symbols, in its
stripped variant, and in the separate debugging information file.
</p>
<p>The debugging information file itself should be an ordinary
executable, containing a full set of linker symbols, sections, and
debugging information.  The sections of the debugging information file
should have the same names, addresses, and sizes as the original file,
but they need not contain any data—much like a <code>.bss</code> section
in an ordinary executable.
</p>
<p>The <small>GNU</small> binary utilities (Binutils) package includes the
‘<samp>objcopy</samp>’ utility that can produce
the separated executable / debugging information file pairs using the
following commands:
</p>
<div>
<pre><kbd>objcopy --only-keep-debug foo foo.debug</kbd>
<kbd>strip -g foo</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>These commands remove the debugging
information from the executable file <samp>foo</samp> and place it in the file
<samp>foo.debug</samp>.  You can use the first, second or both methods to link the
two files:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The debug link method needs the following additional command to also leave
behind a debug link in <samp>foo</samp>:

<div>
<pre><kbd>objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink=foo.debug foo</kbd>
</pre></div>

<p>Ulrich Drepper’s <samp>elfutils</samp> package, starting with version 0.53, contains
a version of the <code>strip</code> command such that the command <kbd>strip foo -f
foo.debug</kbd> has the same functionality as the two <code>objcopy</code> commands and
the <code>ln -s</code> command above, together.

<a name="index-CRC-algorithm-definition"></a>
<p>The CRC used in <code>.gnu_debuglink</code> is the CRC-32 defined in
IEEE 802.3 using the polynomial:
</p>
<div>
<pre> <em>x</em><sup>32</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>26</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>23</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>22</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>16</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>12</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>11</sup>
 + <em>x</em><sup>10</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>8</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>7</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>5</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>4</sup> + <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>x</em> + 1
</pre></div>

<p>The function is computed byte at a time, taking the least
significant bit of each byte first.  The initial pattern
<code>0xffffffff</code> is used, to ensure leading zeros affect the CRC and
the final result is inverted to ensure trailing zeros also affect the
CRC.
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> This is the same CRC polynomial as used in handling the
<em>Remote Serial Protocol</em> <code>qCRC</code> packet (see <a href="#qCRC-packet">qCRC packet</a>).
However in the case of the Remote Serial Protocol, the CRC is computed
<em>most</em> significant bit first, and the result is not inverted, so
trailing zeros have no effect on the CRC value.
</p>
<p>To complete the description, we show below the code of the function
which produces the CRC used in <code>.gnu_debuglink</code>.  Inverting the
initially supplied <code>crc</code> argument means that an initial call to
this function passing in zero will start computing the CRC using
<code>0xffffffff</code>.

<h3>18.4 Debugging information in a special section</h3>
<a name="index-separate-debug-sections"></a>
<a name="index-_002egnu_005fdebugdata-section"></a>

<p>Some systems ship pre-built executables and libraries that have a
special ‘<samp>.gnu_debugdata</samp>’ section.  This feature is called
<em>MiniDebugInfo</em>.  This section holds an LZMA-compressed object and
is used to supply extra symbols for backtraces.
</p>
<p>The intent of this section is to provide extra minimal debugging
information for use in simple backtraces.  It is not intended to be a
replacement for full separate debugging information (see <a href="#Separate-Debug-Files">Separate Debug Files</a>).  The example below shows the intended use; however,
<small>GDB</small> does not currently put restrictions on what sort of
debugging information might be included in the section.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> has support for this extension.  If the section exists,
then it is used provided that no other source of debugging information
can be found, and that <small>GDB</small> was configured with LZMA support.
</p>
<p>This section can be easily created using <code>objcopy</code> and other
standard utilities:
</p>
<div>
<pre># Extract the dynamic symbols from the main binary, there is no need
# to also have these in the normal symbol table.
nm -D <var>binary</var> --format=posix --defined-only \
  | awk &#39;{ print $1 }&#39; | sort &gt; dynsyms

# Extract all the text (i.e. function) symbols from the debuginfo.
# (Note that we actually also accept &#34;D&#34; symbols, for the benefit
# of platforms like PowerPC64 that use function descriptors.)
nm <var>binary</var> --format=posix --defined-only \
  | awk &#39;{ if ($2 == &#34;T&#34; || $2 == &#34;t&#34; || $2 == &#34;D&#34;) print $1 }&#39; \
  | sort &gt; funcsyms

# Keep all the function symbols not already in the dynamic symbol
# table.
comm -13 dynsyms funcsyms &gt; keep_symbols

# Separate full debug info into debug binary.

# Copy the full debuginfo, keeping only a minimal set of symbols and
# removing some unnecessary sections.
objcopy -S --remove-section .gdb_index --remove-section .comment \
  --keep-symbols=keep_symbols debug mini_debuginfo

# Drop the full debug info from the original binary.

<h3>18.5 Index Files Speed Up <small>GDB</small></h3>
<a name="index-index-files"></a>
<a name="index-_002egdb_005findex-section"></a>

<p>When <small>GDB</small> finds a symbol file, it scans the symbols in the
file in order to construct an internal symbol table.  This lets most
<small>GDB</small> operations work quickly—at the cost of a delay early
on.  For large programs, this delay can be quite lengthy, so
<small>GDB</small> provides a way to build an index, which speeds up
startup.
</p>
<p>For convenience, <small>GDB</small> comes with a program,
<code>gdb-add-index</code>, which can be used to add the index to a
symbol file.  It takes the symbol file as its only argument:
</p>


<p>See <a href="#gdb_002dadd_002dindex">gdb-add-index</a>.
</p>
<p>It is also possible to do the work manually.  Here is what
<code>gdb-add-index</code> does behind the curtains.
</p>
<p>The index is stored as a section in the symbol file.  <small>GDB</small> can
write the index to a file, then you can put it into the symbol file
using <code>objcopy</code>.
</p>
<p>To create an index file, use the <code>save gdb-index</code> command:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>save gdb-index [-dwarf-5] <var>directory</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-save-gdb_002dindex"></a>
<p>Create index files for all symbol files currently known by
<small>GDB</small>.  For each known <var>symbol-file</var>, this command by
default creates it produces a single file
<samp><var>symbol-file</var>.gdb-index</samp>.  If you invoke this command with
the <samp>-dwarf-5</samp> option, it produces 2 files:
<samp><var>symbol-file</var>.debug_names</samp> and
<samp><var>symbol-file</var>.debug_str</samp>.  The files are created in the
given <var>directory</var>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Once you have created an index file you can merge it into your symbol
file, here named <samp>symfile</samp>, using <code>objcopy</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ objcopy --add-section .gdb_index=symfile.gdb-index \
    --set-section-flags .gdb_index=readonly symfile symfile
</pre></div>

<p>Or for <code>-dwarf-5</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ objcopy --dump-section .debug_str=symfile.debug_str.new symfile
$ cat symfile.debug_str &gt;&gt;symfile.debug_str.new
$ objcopy --add-section .debug_names=symfile.gdb-index \
    --set-section-flags .debug_names=readonly \
    --update-section .debug_str=symfile.debug_str.new symfile symfile
</pre></div>

<p><small>GDB</small> will normally ignore older versions of <samp>.gdb_index</samp>
sections that have been deprecated.  Usually they are deprecated because
they are missing a new feature or have performance issues.
To tell <small>GDB</small> to use a deprecated index section anyway
specify <code>set use-deprecated-index-sections on</code>.
The default is <code>off</code>.
This can speed up startup, but may result in some functionality being lost.
See <a href="#Index-Section-Format">Index Section Format</a>.
</p>
<p><em>Warning:</em> Setting <code>use-deprecated-index-sections</code> to <code>on</code>
must be done before gdb reads the file.  The following will not work:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ gdb -ex &#34;set use-deprecated-index-sections on&#34; &lt;program&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Instead you must do, for example,
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ gdb -iex &#34;set use-deprecated-index-sections on&#34; &lt;program&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Indices only work when using DWARF debugging information, not stabs.
</p>
<a name="Automatic-symbol-index-cache"></a>
<h4>18.5.1 Automatic symbol index cache</h4>

<a name="index-automatic-symbol-index-cache"></a>
<p>It is possible for <small>GDB</small> to automatically save a copy of this index in a
cache on disk and retrieve it from there when loading the same binary in the
future.  This feature can be turned on with <kbd>set index-cache enabled on</kbd>.
The following commands can be used to tweak the behavior of the index cache.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd>
<a name="index-set-index_002dcache"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set index-cache enabled on</code></dt>
<dt><code>set index-cache enabled off</code></dt>

</dd>
<dt><code>show index-cache directory</code></dt>
<dd><p>Set/show the directory where index files will be saved.
</p>
<p>The default value for this directory depends on the host platform.  On
most systems, the index is cached in the <samp>gdb</samp> subdirectory of
the directory pointed to by the <code>XDG_CACHE_HOME</code> environment
variable, if it is defined, else in the <samp>.cache/gdb</samp> subdirectory
of your home directory.  However, on some systems, the default may
differ according to local convention.
</p>

<a name="Symbol-Errors"></a>

<a name="Errors-Reading-Symbol-Files"></a>
<h3>18.6 Errors Reading Symbol Files</h3>

<p>While reading a symbol file, <small>GDB</small> occasionally encounters problems,
such as symbol types it does not recognize, or known bugs in compiler
output.  By default, <small>GDB</small> does not notify you of such problems, since
they are relatively common and primarily of interest to people
debugging compilers.  If you are interested in seeing information
about ill-constructed symbol tables, you can either ask <small>GDB</small> to print
only one message about each such type of problem, no matter how many
times the problem occurs; or you can ask <small>GDB</small> to print more messages,
to see how many times the problems occur, with the <code>set
complaints</code> command (see <a href="#Messages_002fWarnings">Optional Warnings and
Messages</a>).
</p>
<p>The messages currently printed, and their meanings, include:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>inner block not inside outer block in <var>symbol</var></code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The symbol information shows where symbol scopes begin and end
(such as at the start of a function or a block of statements).  This
error indicates that an inner scope block is not fully contained
in its outer scope blocks.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> circumvents the problem by treating the inner block as if it had
the same scope as the outer block.  In the error message, <var>symbol</var>
may be shown as “<code>(don&#39;t know)</code>” if the outer block is not a
function.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>block at <var>address</var> out of order</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The symbol information for symbol scope blocks should occur in
order of increasing addresses.  This error indicates that it does not
do so.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> does not circumvent this problem, and has trouble
locating symbols in the source file whose symbols it is reading.  (You
can often determine what source file is affected by specifying
<code>set verbose on</code>.  See <a href="#Messages_002fWarnings">Optional Warnings and
Messages</a>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>bad block start address patched</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The symbol information for a symbol scope block has a start address
smaller than the address of the preceding source line.  This is known
to occur in the SunOS 4.1.1 (and earlier) C compiler.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> circumvents the problem by treating the symbol scope block as
starting on the previous source line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>bad string table offset in symbol <var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd>
<a name="index-foo"></a>
<p>Symbol number <var>n</var> contains a pointer into the string table which is
larger than the size of the string table.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> circumvents the problem by considering the symbol to have the
name <code>foo</code>, which may cause other problems if many symbols end up
with this name.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>unknown symbol type <code>0x<var>nn</var></code></code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The symbol information contains new data types that <small>GDB</small> does
not yet know how to read.  <code>0x<var>nn</var></code> is the symbol type of the
uncomprehended information, in hexadecimal.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> circumvents the error by ignoring this symbol information.
This usually allows you to debug your program, though certain symbols
are not accessible.  If you encounter such a problem and feel like
debugging it, you can debug <code>gdb</code> with itself, breakpoint
on <code>complain</code>, then go up to the function <code>read_dbx_symtab</code>
and examine <code>*bufp</code> to see the symbol.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>stub type has NULL name</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><small>GDB</small> could not find the full definition for a struct or class.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>const/volatile indicator missing (ok if using g++ v1.x), got…</code></dt>
<dd><p>The symbol information for a C<tt>++</tt> member function is missing some
information that recent versions of the compiler should have output for
it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>info mismatch between compiler and debugger</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><small>GDB</small> could not parse a type specification output by the compiler.

<h2>19 Specifying a Debugging Target</h2>

<a name="index-debugging-target"></a>
<p>A <em>target</em> is the execution environment occupied by your program.
</p>
<p>Often, <small>GDB</small> runs in the same host environment as your program;
in that case, the debugging target is specified as a side effect when
you use the <code>file</code> or <code>core</code> commands.  When you need more
flexibility—for example, running <small>GDB</small> on a physically separate
host, or controlling a standalone system over a serial port or a
realtime system over a TCP/IP connection—you can use the <code>target</code>
command to specify one of the target types configured for <small>GDB</small>
(see <a href="#Target-Commands">Commands for Managing Targets</a>).
</p>
<a name="index-target-architecture"></a>
<p>It is possible to build <small>GDB</small> for several different <em>target
architectures</em>.  When <small>GDB</small> is built like that, you can choose
one of the available architectures with the <kbd>set architecture</kbd>
command.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-architecture"></a>
<a name="index-show-architecture"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set architecture <var>arch</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>This command sets the current target architecture to <var>arch</var>.  The

<h3>19.1 Active Targets</h3>

<a name="index-stacking-targets"></a>
<a name="index-active-targets"></a>
<a name="index-multiple-targets"></a>

<p>There are multiple classes of targets such as: processes, executable files or
recording sessions.  Core files belong to the process class, making core file
and process mutually exclusive.  Otherwise, <small>GDB</small> can work concurrently
on multiple active targets, one in each class.  This allows you to (for
example) start a process and inspect its activity, while still having access to
the executable file after the process finishes.  Or if you start process
recording (see <a href="#Reverse-Execution">Reverse Execution</a>) and <code>reverse-step</code> there, you are
presented a virtual layer of the recording target, while the process target
remains stopped at the chronologically last point of the process execution.
</p>
<p>Use the <code>core-file</code> and <code>exec-file</code> commands to select a new core
file or executable target (see <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>).  To
specify as a target a process that is already running, use the <code>attach</code>
command (see <a href="#Attach">Debugging an Already-running Process</a>).

<h3>19.3 Choosing Target Byte Order</h3>

<a name="index-choosing-target-byte-order"></a>
<a name="index-target-byte-order"></a>

<p>Some types of processors, such as the <acronym>MIPS</acronym>, PowerPC, and Renesas SH,
offer the ability to run either big-endian or little-endian byte
orders.  Usually the executable or symbol will include a bit to
designate the endian-ness, and you will not need to worry about
which to use.  However, you may still find it useful to adjust
<small>GDB</small>’s idea of processor endian-ness manually.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-endian"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set endian big</code></dt>
<dd><p>Instruct <small>GDB</small> to assume the target is big-endian.

<dd><p>Display <small>GDB</small>’s current idea of the target byte order.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>If the <code>set endian auto</code> mode is in effect and no executable has
been selected, then the endianness used is the last one chosen either
by one of the <code>set endian big</code> and <code>set endian little</code>
commands or by inferring from the last executable used.  If no
endianness has been previously chosen, then the default for this mode
is inferred from the target <small>GDB</small> has been built for, and is
<code>little</code> if the name of the target CPU has an <code>el</code> suffix
and <code>big</code> otherwise.
</p>
<p>Note that these commands merely adjust interpretation of symbolic
data on the host, and that they have absolutely no effect on the
target system.

<h2>20 Debugging Remote Programs</h2>
<a name="index-remote-debugging"></a>

<p>If you are trying to debug a program running on a machine that cannot run
<small>GDB</small> in the usual way, it is often useful to use remote debugging.
For example, you might use remote debugging on an operating system kernel,
or on a small system which does not have a general purpose operating system
powerful enough to run a full-featured debugger.
</p>
<p>Some configurations of <small>GDB</small> have special serial or TCP/IP interfaces
to make this work with particular debugging targets.  In addition,
<small>GDB</small> comes with a generic serial protocol (specific to <small>GDB</small>,
but not specific to any particular target system) which you can use if you
write the remote stubs—the code that runs on the remote system to
communicate with <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>Other remote targets may be available in your
configuration of <small>GDB</small>; use <code>help target</code> to list them.

symbol files on the host and target, and the commands used for
connecting to and disconnecting from the remote target.
</p>
<a name="Types-of-Remote-Connections"></a>
<h4>20.1.1 Types of Remote Connections</h4>

<p><small>GDB</small> supports two types of remote connections, <code>target remote</code>
mode and <code>target extended-remote</code> mode.  Note that many remote targets
support only <code>target remote</code> mode.  There are several major
differences between the two types of connections, enumerated here:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd>
<a name="index-remote-debugging_002c-detach-and-program-exit"></a>
</dd>
<dt>Result of detach or program exit</dt>
<dd><p><strong>With target remote mode:</strong> When the debugged program exits or you
detach from it, <small>GDB</small> disconnects from the target.  When using
<code>gdbserver</code>, <code>gdbserver</code> will exit.
</p>
<p><strong>With target extended-remote mode:</strong> When the debugged program exits or
you detach from it, <small>GDB</small> remains connected to the target, even
though no program is running.  You can rerun the program, attach to a
running program, or use <code>monitor</code> commands specific to the target.
</p>
<p>When using <code>gdbserver</code> in this case, it does not exit unless it was
invoked using the <samp>--once</samp> option.  If the <samp>--once</samp> option
was not used, you can ask <code>gdbserver</code> to exit using the
<code>monitor exit</code> command (see <a href="#Monitor-Commands-for-gdbserver">Monitor Commands for gdbserver</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Specifying the program to debug</dt>
<dd><p>For both connection types you use the <code>file</code> command to specify the
program on the host system.  If you are using <code>gdbserver</code> there are
some differences in how to specify the location of the program on the
target.
</p>
<p><strong>With target remote mode:</strong> You must either specify the program to debug
on the <code>gdbserver</code> command line or use the <samp>--attach</samp> option
(see <a href="#Attaching-to-a-program">Attaching to a Running Program</a>).
</p>
<a name="index-_002d_002dmulti_002c-gdbserver-option"></a>
<p><strong>With target extended-remote mode:</strong> You may specify the program to debug
on the <code>gdbserver</code> command line, or you can load the program or attach
to it using <small>GDB</small> commands after connecting to <code>gdbserver</code>.
</p>
<a name="g_t_002d_002dmulti-Option-in-Types-of-Remote-Connnections"></a><p>You can start <code>gdbserver</code> without supplying an initial command to run
or process ID to attach.  To do this, use the <samp>--multi</samp> command line
option.  Then you can connect using <code>target extended-remote</code> and start
the program you want to debug (see below for details on using the
<code>run</code> command in this scenario).  Note that the conditions under which
<code>gdbserver</code> terminates depend on how <small>GDB</small> connects to it
(<code>target remote</code> or <code>target extended-remote</code>).  The
<samp>--multi</samp> option to <code>gdbserver</code> has no influence on that.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>The <code>run</code> command</dt>
<dd><p><strong>With target remote mode:</strong> The <code>run</code> command is not
supported.  Once a connection has been established, you can use all
the usual <small>GDB</small> commands to examine and change data.  The
remote program is already running, so you can use commands like
<kbd>step</kbd> and <kbd>continue</kbd>.
</p>
<p><strong>With target extended-remote mode:</strong> The <code>run</code> command is
supported.  The <code>run</code> command uses the value set by
<code>set remote exec-file</code> (see <a href="#set-remote-exec_002dfile">set remote exec-file</a>) to select
the program to run.  Command line arguments are supported, except for
wildcard expansion and I/O redirection (see <a href="#Arguments">Arguments</a>).
</p>
<p>If you specify the program to debug on the command line, then the
<code>run</code> command is not required to start execution, and you can
resume using commands like <kbd>step</kbd> and <kbd>continue</kbd> as with
<code>target remote</code> mode.
</p>
<a name="Attaching-in-Types-of-Remote-Connections"></a></dd>
<dt>Attaching</dt>
<dd><p><strong>With target remote mode:</strong> The <small>GDB</small> command <code>attach</code> is
not supported.  To attach to a running program using <code>gdbserver</code>, you
must use the <samp>--attach</samp> option (see <a href="#Running-gdbserver">Running gdbserver</a>).
</p>
<p><strong>With target extended-remote mode:</strong> To attach to a running program,
you may use the <code>attach</code> command after the connection has been
established.  If you are using <code>gdbserver</code>, you may also invoke
<code>gdbserver</code> using the <samp>--attach</samp> option
(see <a href="#Running-gdbserver">Running gdbserver</a>).
</p>
<p>Some remote targets allow <small>GDB</small> to determine the executable file running
in the process the debugger is attaching to.  In such a case, <small>GDB</small>
uses the value of <code>exec-file-mismatch</code> to handle a possible mismatch
between the executable file name running in the process and the name of the
current exec-file loaded by <small>GDB</small> (see <a href="#set-exec_002dfile_002dmismatch">set exec-file-mismatch</a>).

<a name="Host-and-target-files"></a><a name="Host-and-Target-Files"></a>
<h4>20.1.2 Host and Target Files</h4>
<a name="index-remote-debugging_002c-symbol-files"></a>
<a name="index-symbol-files_002c-remote-debugging"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small>, running on the host, needs access to symbol and debugging
information for your program running on the target.  This requires 
access to an unstripped copy of your program, and possibly any associated
symbol files.  Note that this section applies equally to both <code>target
remote</code> mode and <code>target extended-remote</code> mode.
</p>
<p>Some remote targets (see <a href="#qXfer-executable-filename-read">qXfer executable filename read</a>, and
see <a href="#Host-I_002fO-Packets">Host I/O Packets</a>) allow <small>GDB</small> to access program files over
the same connection used to communicate with <small>GDB</small>.  With such a
target, if the remote program is unstripped, the only command you need is
<code>target remote</code> (or <code>target extended-remote</code>).
</p>
<p>If the remote program is stripped, or the target does not support remote
program file access, start up <small>GDB</small> using the name of the local
unstripped copy of your program as the first argument, or use the
<code>file</code> command.  Use <code>set sysroot</code> to specify the location (on
the host) of target libraries (unless your <small>GDB</small> was compiled with
the correct sysroot using <code>--with-sysroot</code>).  Alternatively, you
may use <code>set solib-search-path</code> to specify how <small>GDB</small> locates
target libraries.
</p>
<p>The symbol file and target libraries must exactly match the executable
and libraries on the target, with one exception: the files on the host
system should not be stripped, even if the files on the target system
are.  Mismatched or missing files will lead to confusing results
during debugging.  On <small>GNU</small>/Linux targets, mismatched or missing
files may also prevent <code>gdbserver</code> from debugging multi-threaded
programs.
</p>
<a name="Remote-Connection-Commands"></a>
<h4>20.1.3 Remote Connection Commands</h4>
<a name="index-remote-connection-commands"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> can communicate with the target over a serial line, a
local Unix domain socket, or
over an <acronym>IP</acronym> network using <acronym>TCP</acronym> or <acronym>UDP</acronym>.  In
each case, <small>GDB</small> uses the same protocol for debugging your
program; only the medium carrying the debugging packets varies.  The
<code>target remote</code> and <code>target extended-remote</code> commands
establish a connection to the target.  Both commands accept the same
arguments, which indicate the medium to use:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>target remote <var>serial-device</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>target extended-remote <var>serial-device</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-serial-line_002c-target-remote"></a>
<p>Use <var>serial-device</var> to communicate with the target.  For example,
to use a serial line connected to the device named <samp>/dev/ttyb</samp>:
</p>


<p>If you’re using a serial line, you may want to give <small>GDB</small> the
‘<samp>--baud</samp>’ option, or use the <code>set serial baud</code> command
(see <a href="#Remote-Configuration">set serial baud</a>) before the
<code>target</code> command.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>target remote <var>local-socket</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>target extended-remote <var>local-socket</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-local-socket_002c-target-remote"></a>
<a name="index-Unix-domain-socket"></a>
<p>Use <var>local-socket</var> to communicate with the target.  For example,
to use a local Unix domain socket bound to the file system entry <samp>/tmp/gdb-socket0</samp>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target remote /tmp/gdb-socket0
</pre></div>

<p>Note that this command has the same form as the command to connect
to a serial line.  <small>GDB</small> will automatically determine which
kind of file you have specified and will make the appropriate kind
of connection.
This feature is not available if the host system does not support
Unix domain sockets.

<p>Debug using a <acronym>TCP</acronym> connection to <var>port</var> on <var>host</var>.
The <var>host</var> may be either a host name, a numeric <acronym>IPv4</acronym>
address, or a numeric <acronym>IPv6</acronym> address (with or without the
square brackets to separate the address from the port); <var>port</var>
must be a decimal number.  The <var>host</var> could be the target machine
itself, if it is directly connected to the net, or it might be a
terminal server which in turn has a serial line to the target.
</p>
<p>For example, to connect to port 2828 on a terminal server named
<code>manyfarms</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target remote manyfarms:2828
</pre></div>

<p>To connect to port 2828 on a terminal server whose address is
<code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code>, you can either use the
square bracket syntax:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target remote [2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334]:2828
</pre></div>

<p>or explicitly specify the <acronym>IPv6</acronym> protocol:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target remote tcp6:2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334:2828
</pre></div>

<p>This last example may be confusing to the reader, because there is no
visible separation between the hostname and the port number.
Therefore, we recommend the user to provide <acronym>IPv6</acronym> addresses
using square brackets for clarity.  However, it is important to
mention that for <small>GDB</small> there is no ambiguity: the number after
the last colon is considered to be the port number.
</p>
<p>If your remote target is actually running on the same machine as your
debugger session (e.g. a simulator for your target running on the
same host), you can omit the hostname.  For example, to connect to
port 1234 on your local machine:
</p>


<p>Note that the colon is still required here.

<h3>20.3 Using the <code>gdbserver</code> Program</h3>

<a name="index-gdbserver"></a>
<a name="index-remote-connection-without-stubs"></a>
<p><code>gdbserver</code> is a control program for Unix-like systems, which
allows you to connect your program with a remote <small>GDB</small> via
<code>target remote</code> or <code>target extended-remote</code>—but without
linking in the usual debugging stub.
</p>
<p><code>gdbserver</code> is not a complete replacement for the debugging stubs,
because it requires essentially the same operating-system facilities
that <small>GDB</small> itself does.  In fact, a system that can run
<code>gdbserver</code> to connect to a remote <small>GDB</small> could also run
<small>GDB</small> locally!  <code>gdbserver</code> is sometimes useful nevertheless,
because it is a much smaller program than <small>GDB</small> itself.  It is
also easier to port than all of <small>GDB</small>, so you may be able to get
started more quickly on a new system by using <code>gdbserver</code>.
Finally, if you develop code for real-time systems, you may find that
the tradeoffs involved in real-time operation make it more convenient to
do as much development work as possible on another system, for example
by cross-compiling.  You can use <code>gdbserver</code> to make a similar
choice for debugging.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> and <code>gdbserver</code> communicate via either a serial line
or a TCP connection, using the standard <small>GDB</small> remote serial
protocol.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Warning:</em> <code>gdbserver</code> does not have any built-in security.
Do not run <code>gdbserver</code> connected to any public network; a
<small>GDB</small> connection to <code>gdbserver</code> provides access to the
target system with the same privileges as the user running
<code>gdbserver</code>.
</p></blockquote>

<a name="Running-gdbserver"></a><a name="Running-gdbserver-1"></a>
<h4>20.3.1 Running <code>gdbserver</code></h4>
<a name="index-arguments_002c-to-gdbserver"></a>
<a name="index-gdbserver_002c-command_002dline-arguments"></a>

<p>Run <code>gdbserver</code> on the target system.  You need a copy of the
program you want to debug, including any libraries it requires.
<code>gdbserver</code> does not need your program’s symbol table, so you can
strip the program if necessary to save space.  <small>GDB</small> on the host
system does all the symbol handling.
</p>
<p>To use the server, you must tell it how to communicate with <small>GDB</small>;
the name of your program; and the arguments for your program.  The usual
syntax is:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver <var>comm</var> <var>program</var> [ <var>args</var> … ]
</pre></div>

<p><var>comm</var> is either a device name (to use a serial line), or a TCP
hostname and portnumber, or <code>-</code> or <code>stdio</code> to use
stdin/stdout of <code>gdbserver</code>.
For example, to debug Emacs with the argument
‘<samp>foo.txt</samp>’ and communicate with <small>GDB</small> over the serial port
<samp>/dev/com1</samp>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver /dev/com1 emacs foo.txt
</pre></div>

<p><code>gdbserver</code> waits passively for the host <small>GDB</small> to communicate
with it.
</p>
<p>To use a TCP connection instead of a serial line:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt
</pre></div>

<p>The only difference from the previous example is the first argument,
specifying that you are communicating with the host <small>GDB</small> via
TCP.  The ‘<samp>host:2345</samp>’ argument means that <code>gdbserver</code> is to
expect a TCP connection from machine ‘<samp>host</samp>’ to local TCP port 2345.
(Currently, the ‘<samp>host</samp>’ part is ignored.)  You can choose any number
you want for the port number as long as it does not conflict with any
TCP ports already in use on the target system (for example, <code>23</code> is
reserved for <code>telnet</code>).<a name="DOCF16" href="#FOOT16"><sup>16</sup></a>  You must use the same port number with the host <small>GDB</small>
<code>target remote</code> command.
</p>
<p>The <code>stdio</code> connection is useful when starting <code>gdbserver</code>
with ssh:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) target remote | ssh -T hostname gdbserver - hello
</pre></div>

<p>The ‘<samp>-T</samp>’ option to ssh is provided because we don’t need a remote pty,
and we don’t want escape-character handling.  Ssh does this by default when
a command is provided, the flag is provided to make it explicit.
You could elide it if you want to.
</p>
<p>Programs started with stdio-connected gdbserver have <samp>/dev/null</samp> for
<code>stdin</code>, and <code>stdout</code>,<code>stderr</code> are sent back to gdb for
display through a pipe connected to gdbserver.
Both <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> use the same pipe.
</p>
<a name="Attaching-to-a-program"></a><a name="Attaching-to-a-Running-Program"></a>
<h4>20.3.1.1 Attaching to a Running Program</h4>
<a name="index-attach-to-a-program_002c-gdbserver"></a>
<a name="index-_002d_002dattach_002c-gdbserver-option"></a>

<p>On some targets, <code>gdbserver</code> can also attach to running programs.
This is accomplished via the <code>--attach</code> argument.  The syntax is:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> <var>pid</var>
</pre></div>

<p><var>pid</var> is the process ID of a currently running process.  It isn’t
necessary to point <code>gdbserver</code> at a binary for the running process.
</p>
<p>In <code>target extended-remote</code> mode, you can also attach using the
<small>GDB</small> attach command
(see <a href="#Attaching-in-Types-of-Remote-Connections">Attaching in Types of Remote Connections</a>).
</p>
<a name="index-pidof"></a>
<p>You can debug processes by name instead of process ID if your target has the
<code>pidof</code> utility:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> `pidof <var>program</var>`
</pre></div>

<p>In case more than one copy of <var>program</var> is running, or <var>program</var>
has multiple threads, most versions of <code>pidof</code> support the
<code>-s</code> option to only return the first process ID.
</p>
<a name="TCP-port-allocation-lifecycle-of-gdbserver"></a>
<h4>20.3.1.2 TCP port allocation lifecycle of <code>gdbserver</code></h4>

<p>This section applies only when <code>gdbserver</code> is run to listen on a TCP
port.
</p>
<p><code>gdbserver</code> normally terminates after all of its debugged processes have
terminated in <kbd>target remote</kbd> mode.  On the other hand, for <kbd>target
extended-remote</kbd>, <code>gdbserver</code> stays running even with no processes left.
<small>GDB</small> normally terminates the spawned debugged process on its exit,
which normally also terminates <code>gdbserver</code> in the <kbd>target remote</kbd>
mode.  Therefore, when the connection drops unexpectedly, and <small>GDB</small>
cannot ask <code>gdbserver</code> to kill its debugged processes, <code>gdbserver</code>
stays running even in the <kbd>target remote</kbd> mode.
</p>
<p>When <code>gdbserver</code> stays running, <small>GDB</small> can connect to it again later.
Such reconnecting is useful for features like <a href="#disconnected-tracing">disconnected tracing</a>.  For
completeness, at most one <small>GDB</small> can be connected at a time.
</p>
<a name="index-_002d_002donce_002c-gdbserver-option"></a>
<p>By default, <code>gdbserver</code> keeps the listening TCP port open, so that
subsequent connections are possible.  However, if you start <code>gdbserver</code>
with the <samp>--once</samp> option, it will stop listening for any further
connection attempts after connecting to the first <small>GDB</small> session.  This
means no further connections to <code>gdbserver</code> will be possible after the
first one.  It also means <code>gdbserver</code> will terminate after the first
connection with remote <small>GDB</small> has closed, even for unexpectedly closed
connections and even in the <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd> mode.  The
<samp>--once</samp> option allows reusing the same port number for connecting to
multiple instances of <code>gdbserver</code> running on the same host, since each
instance closes its port after the first connection.

<a name="Other-Command_002dLine-Arguments-for-gdbserver"></a><a name="Other-Command_002dLine-Arguments-for-gdbserver-1"></a>
<h4>20.3.1.3 Other Command-Line Arguments for <code>gdbserver</code></h4>

<p>You can use the <samp>--multi</samp> option to start <code>gdbserver</code> without
specifying a program to debug or a process to attach to.  Then you can
attach in <code>target extended-remote</code> mode and run or attach to a
program.  For more information,
see <a href="#g_t_002d_002dmulti-Option-in-Types-of-Remote-Connnections">--multi Option in Types of Remote Connnections</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-_002d_002ddebug_002c-gdbserver-option"></a>
<p>The <samp>--debug</samp> option tells <code>gdbserver</code> to display extra
status information about the debugging process.
<a name="index-_002d_002dremote_002ddebug_002c-gdbserver-option"></a>
The <samp>--remote-debug</samp> option tells <code>gdbserver</code> to display
remote protocol debug output.
<a name="index-_002d_002ddebug_002dfile_002c-gdbserver-option"></a>
<a name="index-gdbserver_002c-send-all-debug-output-to-a-single-file"></a>
The <samp>--debug-file=<var>filename</var></samp> option tells <code>gdbserver</code> to
write any debug output to the given <var>filename</var>.  These options are intended
for <code>gdbserver</code> development and for bug reports to the developers.
</p>
<a name="index-_002d_002ddebug_002dformat_002c-gdbserver-option"></a>
<p>The <samp>--debug-format=option1[,option2,...]</samp> option tells
<code>gdbserver</code> to include additional information in each output.
Possible options are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>none</code></dt>
<dd><p>Turn off all extra information in debugging output.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>all</code></dt>
<dd><p>Turn on all extra information in debugging output.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>timestamps</code></dt>
<dd><p>Include a timestamp in each line of debugging output.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Options are processed in order.  Thus, for example, if <samp>none</samp>
appears last then no additional information is added to debugging output.
</p>
<a name="index-_002d_002dwrapper_002c-gdbserver-option"></a>
<p>The <samp>--wrapper</samp> option specifies a wrapper to launch programs
for debugging.  The option should be followed by the name of the
wrapper, then any command-line arguments to pass to the wrapper, then
<kbd>--</kbd> indicating the end of the wrapper arguments.
</p>
<p><code>gdbserver</code> runs the specified wrapper program with a combined
command line including the wrapper arguments, then the name of the
program to debug, then any arguments to the program.  The wrapper
runs until it executes your program, and then <small>GDB</small> gains control.
</p>
<p>You can use any program that eventually calls <code>execve</code> with
its arguments as a wrapper.  Several standard Unix utilities do
this, e.g. <code>env</code> and <code>nohup</code>.  Any Unix shell script ending
with <code>exec &#34;$@&#34;</code> will also work.
</p>
<p>For example, you can use <code>env</code> to pass an environment variable to
the debugged program, without setting the variable in <code>gdbserver</code>’s
environment:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ gdbserver --wrapper env LD_PRELOAD=libtest.so -- :2222 ./testprog
</pre></div>

<a name="index-_002d_002dselftest"></a>
<p>The <samp>--selftest</samp> option runs the self tests in <code>gdbserver</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ gdbserver --selftest
Ran 2 unit tests, 0 failed
</pre></div>

<p>These tests are disabled in release.
</p><a name="Connecting-to-gdbserver"></a>
<h4>20.3.2 Connecting to <code>gdbserver</code></h4>

<p>The basic procedure for connecting to the remote target is:
</p><ul>
<li> Run <small>GDB</small> on the host system.

</li><li> Make sure you have the necessary symbol files
(see <a href="#Host-and-target-files">Host and target files</a>).
Load symbols for your application using the <code>file</code> command before you
connect.  Use <code>set sysroot</code> to locate target libraries (unless your
<small>GDB</small> was compiled with the correct sysroot using
<code>--with-sysroot</code>).

</li><li> Connect to your target (see <a href="#Connecting">Connecting to a Remote Target</a>).
For TCP connections, you must start up <code>gdbserver</code> prior to using
the <code>target</code> command.  Otherwise you may get an error whose
text depends on the host system, but which usually looks something like
‘<samp>Connection refused</samp>’.  Don’t use the <code>load</code>
command in <small>GDB</small> when using <code>target remote</code> mode, since the
program is already on the target.

</li></ul>

<h4>20.3.3 Monitor Commands for <code>gdbserver</code></h4>
<a name="index-monitor-commands_002c-for-gdbserver"></a>

<p>During a <small>GDB</small> session using <code>gdbserver</code>, you can use the

<a name="Tracepoints-support-in-gdbserver"></a>
<h4>20.3.4 Tracepoints support in <code>gdbserver</code></h4>
<a name="index-tracepoints-support-in-gdbserver"></a>

<p>On some targets, <code>gdbserver</code> supports tracepoints, fast
tracepoints and static tracepoints.
</p>
<p>For fast or static tracepoints to work, a special library called the
<em>in-process agent</em> (IPA), must be loaded in the inferior process.
This library is built and distributed as an integral part of
<code>gdbserver</code>.  In addition, support for static tracepoints
requires building the in-process agent library with static tracepoints
support.  At present, the UST (LTTng Userspace Tracer,
<a href="http://lttng.org/ust">http://lttng.org/ust</a>) tracing engine is supported.  This support
is automatically available if UST development headers are found in the
standard include path when <code>gdbserver</code> is built, or if
<code>gdbserver</code> was explicitly configured using <samp>--with-ust</samp>
to point at such headers.  You can explicitly disable the support
using <samp>--with-ust=no</samp>.
</p>
<p>There are several ways to load the in-process agent in your program:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>Specifying it as dependency at link time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>You can link your program dynamically with the in-process agent
library.  On most systems, this is accomplished by adding
<code>-linproctrace</code> to the link command.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Using the system&#39;s preloading mechanisms</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>You can force loading the in-process agent at startup time by using
your system’s support for preloading shared libraries.  Many Unixes
support the concept of preloading user defined libraries.  In most
cases, you do that by specifying <code>LD_PRELOAD=libinproctrace.so</code>
in the environment.  See also the description of <code>gdbserver</code>’s
<samp>--wrapper</samp> command line option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Using <small>GDB</small> to force loading the agent at run time</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>On some systems, you can force the inferior to load a shared library,
by calling a dynamic loader function in the inferior that takes care
of dynamically looking up and loading a shared library.  On most Unix
systems, the function is <code>dlopen</code>.  You’ll use the <code>call</code>
command for that.  For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) call dlopen (&#34;libinproctrace.so&#34;, ...)
</pre></div>

<p>Note that on most Unix systems, for the <code>dlopen</code> function to be
available, the program needs to be linked with <code>-ldl</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>On systems that have a userspace dynamic loader, like most Unix
systems, when you connect to <code>gdbserver</code> using <code>target
remote</code>, you’ll find that the program is stopped at the dynamic
loader’s entry point, and no shared library has been loaded in the
program’s address space yet, including the in-process agent.  In that
case, before being able to use any of the fast or static tracepoints
features, you need to let the loader run and load the shared
libraries.  The simplest way to do that is to run the program to the
main procedure.  E.g., if debugging a C or C<tt>++</tt> program, start
<code>gdbserver</code> like so:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ gdbserver :9999 myprogram
</pre></div>

<p>Start GDB and connect to <code>gdbserver</code> like so, and run to main:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ gdb myprogram
(gdb) target remote myhost:9999
0x00007f215893ba60 in ?? () from /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
(gdb) b main
(gdb) continue
</pre></div>

<p>The in-process tracing agent library should now be loaded into the
process; you can confirm it with the <code>info sharedlibrary</code>
command, which will list <samp>libinproctrace.so</samp> as loaded in the
process.  You are now ready to install fast tracepoints, list static
tracepoint markers, probe static tracepoints markers, and start
tracing.

<p>The <small>GDB</small> remote protocol autodetects the packets supported by
your debugging stub.  If you need to override the autodetection, you
can use these commands to enable or disable individual packets.  Each
packet can be set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’ (the remote target supports this
packet), ‘<samp>off</samp>’ (the remote target does not support this packet),
or ‘<samp>auto</samp>’ (detect remote target support for this packet).  They
all default to ‘<samp>auto</samp>’.  For more information about each packet,
see <a href="#Remote-Protocol">Remote Protocol</a>.
</p>
<p>During normal use, you should not have to use any of these commands.
If you do, that may be a bug in your remote debugging stub, or a bug
in <small>GDB</small>.  You may want to report the problem to the
<small>GDB</small> developers.

<h3>20.5 Implementing a Remote Stub</h3>

<a name="index-debugging-stub_002c-example"></a>
<a name="index-remote-stub_002c-example"></a>
<a name="index-stub-example_002c-remote-debugging"></a>
<p>The stub files provided with <small>GDB</small> implement the target side of the
communication protocol, and the <small>GDB</small> side is implemented in the
<small>GDB</small> source file <samp>remote.c</samp>.  Normally, you can simply allow
these subroutines to communicate, and ignore the details.  (If you’re
implementing your own stub file, you can still ignore the details: start
with one of the existing stub files.  <samp>sparc-stub.c</samp> is the best
organized, and therefore the easiest to read.)
</p>
<a name="index-remote-serial-debugging_002c-overview"></a>
<p>To debug a program running on another machine (the debugging
<em>target</em> machine), you must first arrange for all the usual
prerequisites for the program to run by itself.  For example, for a C
program, you need:
</p>
<ol>
<li> A startup routine to set up the C runtime environment; these usually
have a name like <samp>crt0</samp>.  The startup routine may be supplied by
your hardware supplier, or you may have to write your own.

</li><li> A C subroutine library to support your program’s
subroutine calls, notably managing input and output.

</li><li> A way of getting your program to the other machine—for example, a
download program.  These are often supplied by the hardware
manufacturer, but you may have to write your own from hardware
documentation.
</li></ol>

<p>The next step is to arrange for your program to use a serial port to
communicate with the machine where <small>GDB</small> is running (the <em>host</em>
machine).  In general terms, the scheme looks like this:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>On the host,</em></dt>
<dd><p><small>GDB</small> already understands how to use this protocol; when everything
else is set up, you can simply use the ‘<samp>target remote</samp>’ command
(see <a href="#Targets">Specifying a Debugging Target</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>On the target,</em></dt>
<dd><p>you must link with your program a few special-purpose subroutines that
implement the <small>GDB</small> remote serial protocol.  The file containing these
subroutines is called  a <em>debugging stub</em>.
</p>
<p>On certain remote targets, you can use an auxiliary program
<code>gdbserver</code> instead of linking a stub into your program.
See <a href="#Server">Using the <code>gdbserver</code> Program</a>, for details.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The debugging stub is specific to the architecture of the remote
machine; for example, use <samp>sparc-stub.c</samp> to debug programs on
<small>SPARC</small> boards.

<a name="Stub-Contents"></a>

<a name="What-the-Stub-Can-Do-for-You"></a>
<h4>20.5.1 What the Stub Can Do for You</h4>

<a name="index-remote-serial-stub"></a>
<p>The debugging stub for your architecture supplies these three
subroutines:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set_debug_traps</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set_005fdebug_005ftraps"></a>
<a name="index-remote-serial-stub_002c-initialization"></a>
<p>This routine arranges for <code>handle_exception</code> to run when your
program stops.  You must call this subroutine explicitly in your
program’s startup code.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>handle_exception</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-handle_005fexception"></a>
<a name="index-remote-serial-stub_002c-main-routine"></a>
<p>This is the central workhorse, but your program never calls it
explicitly—the setup code arranges for <code>handle_exception</code> to
run when a trap is triggered.
</p>
<p><code>handle_exception</code> takes control when your program stops during
execution (for example, on a breakpoint), and mediates communications
with <small>GDB</small> on the host machine.  This is where the communications
protocol is implemented; <code>handle_exception</code> acts as the <small>GDB</small>
representative on the target machine.  It begins by sending summary
information on the state of your program, then continues to execute,
retrieving and transmitting any information <small>GDB</small> needs, until you
execute a <small>GDB</small> command that makes your program resume; at that point,
<code>handle_exception</code> returns control to your own code on the target
machine.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>breakpoint</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-breakpoint-subroutine_002c-remote"></a>
<p>Use this auxiliary subroutine to make your program contain a
breakpoint.  Depending on the particular situation, this may be the only
way for <small>GDB</small> to get control.  For instance, if your target
machine has some sort of interrupt button, you won’t need to call this;
pressing the interrupt button transfers control to
<code>handle_exception</code>—in effect, to <small>GDB</small>.  On some machines,
simply receiving characters on the serial port may also trigger a trap;
again, in that situation, you don’t need to call <code>breakpoint</code> from
your own program—simply running ‘<samp>target remote</samp>’ from the host
<small>GDB</small> session gets control.
</p>
<p>Call <code>breakpoint</code> if none of these is true, or if you simply want
to make certain your program stops at a predetermined point for the
start of your debugging session.

<h4>20.5.2 What You Must Do for the Stub</h4>

<a name="index-remote-stub_002c-support-routines"></a>
<p>The debugging stubs that come with <small>GDB</small> are set up for a particular
chip architecture, but they have no information about the rest of your
debugging target machine.
</p>
<p>First of all you need to tell the stub how to communicate with the
serial port.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>int getDebugChar()</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-getDebugChar"></a>
<p>Write this subroutine to read a single character from the serial port.
It may be identical to <code>getchar</code> for your target system; a
different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you wish.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>void putDebugChar(int)</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-putDebugChar"></a>
<p>Write this subroutine to write a single character to the serial port.
It may be identical to <code>putchar</code> for your target system; a
different name is used to allow you to distinguish the two if you wish.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-control-C_002c-and-remote-debugging"></a>
<a name="index-interrupting-remote-targets"></a>
<p>If you want <small>GDB</small> to be able to stop your program while it is
running, you need to use an interrupt-driven serial driver, and arrange
for it to stop when it receives a <code>^C</code> (‘<samp>\003</samp>’, the control-C
character).  That is the character which <small>GDB</small> uses to tell the
remote system to stop.
</p>
<p>Getting the debugging target to return the proper status to <small>GDB</small>
probably requires changes to the standard stub; one quick and dirty way
is to just execute a breakpoint instruction (the “dirty” part is that
<small>GDB</small> reports a <code>SIGTRAP</code> instead of a <code>SIGINT</code>).
</p>
<p>Other routines you need to supply are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>void exceptionHandler (int <var>exception_number</var>, void *<var>exception_address</var>)</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-exceptionHandler"></a>
<p>Write this function to install <var>exception_address</var> in the exception
handling tables.  You need to do this because the stub does not have any
way of knowing what the exception handling tables on your target system
are like (for example, the processor’s table might be in <small>ROM</small>,
containing entries which point to a table in <small>RAM</small>).
The <var>exception_number</var> specifies the exception which should be changed;
its meaning is architecture-dependent (for example, different numbers
might represent divide by zero, misaligned access, etc).  When this
exception occurs, control should be transferred directly to
<var>exception_address</var>, and the processor state (stack, registers,
and so on) should be just as it is when a processor exception occurs.  So if
you want to use a jump instruction to reach <var>exception_address</var>, it
should be a simple jump, not a jump to subroutine.
</p>
<p>For the 386, <var>exception_address</var> should be installed as an interrupt
gate so that interrupts are masked while the handler runs.  The gate
should be at privilege level 0 (the most privileged level).  The
<small>SPARC</small> and 68k stubs are able to mask interrupts themselves without
help from <code>exceptionHandler</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>void flush_i_cache()</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-flush_005fi_005fcache"></a>
<p>On <small>SPARC</small> and <small>SPARCLITE</small> only, write this subroutine to flush the
instruction cache, if any, on your target machine.  If there is no
instruction cache, this subroutine may be a no-op.
</p>
<p>On target machines that have instruction caches, <small>GDB</small> requires this
function to make certain that the state of your program is stable.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>You must also make sure this library routine is available:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>void *memset(void *, int, int)</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-memset"></a>
<p>This is the standard library function <code>memset</code> that sets an area of
memory to a known value.  If you have one of the free versions of
<code>libc.a</code>, <code>memset</code> can be found there; otherwise, you must
either obtain it from your hardware manufacturer, or write your own.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If you do not use the GNU C compiler, you may need other standard
library subroutines as well; this varies from one stub to another,
but in general the stubs are likely to use any of the common library
subroutines which <code><small>GCC</small></code> generates as inline code.

<a name="Putting-it-All-Together"></a>
<h4>20.5.3 Putting it All Together</h4>

<a name="index-remote-serial-debugging-summary"></a>
<p>In summary, when your program is ready to debug, you must follow these
steps.
</p>
<ol>
<li> Make sure you have defined the supporting low-level routines
(see <a href="#Bootstrapping">What You Must Do for the Stub</a>):
<div>
<pre><code>getDebugChar</code>, <code>putDebugChar</code>,
<code>flush_i_cache</code>, <code>memset</code>, <code>exceptionHandler</code>.
</pre></div>

</li><li> Insert these lines in your program’s startup code, before the main
procedure is called:

<div>
<pre>set_debug_traps();
breakpoint();
</pre></div>

<p>On some machines, when a breakpoint trap is raised, the hardware
automatically makes the PC point to the instruction after the
breakpoint.  If your machine doesn’t do that, you may need to adjust
<code>handle_exception</code> to arrange for it to return to the instruction
after the breakpoint on this first invocation, so that your program
doesn’t keep hitting the initial breakpoint instead of making
progress.
</p>
</li><li> For the 680x0 stub only, you need to provide a variable called
<code>exceptionHook</code>.  Normally you just use:

<div>
<pre>void (*exceptionHook)() = 0;
</pre></div>

<p>but if before calling <code>set_debug_traps</code>, you set it to point to a
function in your program, that function is called when
<code><small>GDB</small></code> continues after stopping on a trap (for example, bus
error).  The function indicated by <code>exceptionHook</code> is called with
one parameter: an <code>int</code> which is the exception number.
</p>
</li><li> Compile and link together: your program, the <small>GDB</small> debugging stub for
your target architecture, and the supporting subroutines.

</li><li> Make sure you have a serial connection between your target machine and
the <small>GDB</small> host, and identify the serial port on the host.

</li><li> Download your program to your target machine (or get it there by
whatever means the manufacturer provides), and start it.

</li><li> Start <small>GDB</small> on the host, and connect to the target
(see <a href="#Connecting">Connecting to a Remote Target</a>).

</li></ol>

<a name="Configuration_002dSpecific-Information"></a>
<h2>21 Configuration-Specific Information</h2>

<p>While nearly all <small>GDB</small> commands are available for all native and
cross versions of the debugger, there are some exceptions.  This chapter
describes things that are only available in certain configurations.
</p>
<p>There are three major categories of configurations: native
configurations, where the host and target are the same, embedded
operating system configurations, which are usually the same for several
different processor architectures, and bare embedded processors, which
are quite different from each other.
</p>

<h4>21.1.1 BSD libkvm Interface</h4>

<a name="index-libkvm"></a>
<a name="index-kernel-memory-image"></a>
<a name="index-kernel-crash-dump"></a>

<p>BSD-derived systems (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD) have a kernel memory
interface that provides a uniform interface for accessing kernel virtual
memory images, including live systems and crash dumps.  <small>GDB</small>
uses this interface to allow you to debug live kernels and kernel crash
dumps on many native BSD configurations.  This is implemented as a
special <code>kvm</code> debugging target.  For debugging a live system, load
the currently running kernel into <small>GDB</small> and connect to the
<code>kvm</code> target:
</p>


<p>For debugging crash dumps, provide the file name of the crash dump as an
argument:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) <b>target kvm /var/crash/bsd.0</b>
</pre></div>

<p>Once connected to the <code>kvm</code> target, the following commands are
available:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-kvm"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>kvm pcb</code></dt>
<dd><p>Set current context from the <em>Process Control Block</em> (PCB) address.

<h4>21.1.2 Process Information</h4>
<a name="index-_002fproc"></a>
<a name="index-examine-process-image"></a>
<a name="index-process-info-via-_002fproc"></a>

<p>Some operating systems provide interfaces to fetch additional
information about running processes beyond memory and per-thread
register state.  If <small>GDB</small> is configured for an operating system
with a supported interface, the command <code>info proc</code> is available
to report information about the process running your program, or about
any process running on your system.
</p>
<p>One supported interface is a facility called ‘<samp>/proc</samp>’ that can be
used to examine the image of a running process using file-system
subroutines.  This facility is supported on <small>GNU</small>/Linux and Solaris
systems.
</p>
<p>On FreeBSD and NetBSD systems, system control nodes are used to query
process information.
</p>
<p>In addition, some systems may provide additional process information
in core files.  Note that a core file may include a subset of the
information available from a live process.  Process information is
currently available from cores created on <small>GNU</small>/Linux and FreeBSD
systems.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

executable file’s absolute file name.
</p>
<p>On some systems, <var>process-id</var> can be of the form
‘<samp>[<var>pid</var>]/<var>tid</var></samp>’ which specifies a certain thread ID
within a process.  If the optional <var>pid</var> part is missing, it means
a thread from the process being debugged (the leading ‘<samp>/</samp>’ still
needs to be present, or else <small>GDB</small> will interpret the number as
a process ID rather than a thread ID).
</p>
</dd>

<p>Show the file descriptors open by the process.  For each open file
descriptor, <small>GDB</small> shows its number, type (file, directory,
character device, socket), file pointer offset, and the name of the
resource open on the descriptor.  The resource name can be a file name
(for files, directories, and devices) or a protocol followed by socket
address (for network connections).  This command is supported on
FreeBSD.
</p>
<p>This example shows the open file descriptors for a process using a
tty for standard input and output as well as two network sockets:

<a name="index-native-DJGPP-debugging"></a>
<a name="index-MS_002dDOS_002dspecific-commands"></a>

<a name="index-DPMI"></a>
<p><small>DJGPP</small> is a port of the <small>GNU</small> development tools to MS-DOS and
MS-Windows.  <small>DJGPP</small> programs are 32-bit protected-mode programs
that use the <em>DPMI</em> (DOS Protected-Mode Interface) API to run on
top of real-mode DOS systems and their emulations.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> supports native debugging of <small>DJGPP</small> programs, and
defines a few commands specific to the <small>DJGPP</small> port.  This
subsection describes those commands.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-info-dos"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>info dos</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is a prefix of <small>DJGPP</small>-specific commands which print
information about the target system and important OS structures.

<a name="index-sysinfo"></a>
<a name="index-MS_002dDOS-system-info"></a>
<a name="index-free-memory-information-_0028MS_002dDOS_0029"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>info dos sysinfo</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command displays assorted information about the underlying
platform: the CPU type and features, the OS version and flavor, the
DPMI version, and the available conventional and DPMI memory.
</p>
<a name="index-GDT"></a>
<a name="index-LDT"></a>
<a name="index-IDT"></a>
<a name="index-segment-descriptor-tables"></a>
<a name="index-descriptor-tables-display"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>info dos gdt</code></dt>
<dt><code>info dos ldt</code></dt>
<dt><code>info dos idt</code></dt>
<dd><p>These 3 commands display entries from, respectively, Global, Local,
and Interrupt Descriptor Tables (GDT, LDT, and IDT).  The descriptor
tables are data structures which store a descriptor for each segment
that is currently in use.  The segment’s selector is an index into a
descriptor table; the table entry for that index holds the
descriptor’s base address and limit, and its attributes and access
rights.
</p>
<p>A typical <small>DJGPP</small> program uses 3 segments: a code segment, a data
segment (used for both data and the stack), and a DOS segment (which
allows access to DOS/BIOS data structures and absolute addresses in
conventional memory).  However, the DPMI host will usually define
additional segments in order to support the DPMI environment.
</p>
<a name="index-garbled-pointers"></a>
<p>These commands allow to display entries from the descriptor tables.
Without an argument, all entries from the specified table are
displayed.  An argument, which should be an integer expression, means
display a single entry whose index is given by the argument.  For
example, here’s a convenient way to display information about the
debugged program’s data segment:
</p>
<div>
<pre><code>(gdb) info dos ldt $ds</code>
</pre><pre><code>0x13f: base=0x11970000 limit=0x0009ffff 32-Bit Data (Read/Write, Exp-up)</code>
</pre></div>

<p>This comes in handy when you want to see whether a pointer is outside
the data segment’s limit (i.e. <em>garbled</em>).
</p>
<a name="index-page-tables-display-_0028MS_002dDOS_0029"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>info dos pde</code></dt>
<dt><code>info dos pte</code></dt>
<dd><p>These two commands display entries from, respectively, the Page
Directory and the Page Tables.  Page Directories and Page Tables are
data structures which control how virtual memory addresses are mapped
into physical addresses.  A Page Table includes an entry for every
page of memory that is mapped into the program’s address space; there
may be several Page Tables, each one holding up to 4096 entries.  A
Page Directory has up to 4096 entries, one each for every Page Table
that is currently in use.
</p>
<p>Without an argument, <kbd>info dos pde</kbd> displays the entire Page
Directory, and <kbd>info dos pte</kbd> displays all the entries in all of
the Page Tables.  An argument, an integer expression, given to the
<kbd>info dos pde</kbd> command means display only that entry from the Page
Directory table.  An argument given to the <kbd>info dos pte</kbd> command
means display entries from a single Page Table, the one pointed to by
the specified entry in the Page Directory.
</p>
<a name="index-direct-memory-access-_0028DMA_0029-on-MS_002dDOS"></a>
<p>These commands are useful when your program uses <em>DMA</em> (Direct
Memory Access), which needs physical addresses to program the DMA
controller.
</p>
<p>These commands are supported only with some DPMI servers.
</p>
<a name="index-physical-address-from-linear-address"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>info dos address-pte <var>addr</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>This command displays the Page Table entry for a specified linear
address.  The argument <var>addr</var> is a linear address which should
already have the appropriate segment’s base address added to it,
because this command accepts addresses which may belong to <em>any</em>
segment.  For example, here’s how to display the Page Table entry for
the page where a variable <code>i</code> is stored:
</p>
<div>
<pre><code>(gdb) info dos address-pte __djgpp_base_address + (char *)&amp;i</code>
</pre><pre><code>Page Table entry for address 0x11a00d30:</code>
</pre><pre><code>Base=0x02698000 Dirty Acc. Not-Cached Write-Back Usr Read-Write +0xd30</code>
</pre></div>

<p>This says that <code>i</code> is stored at offset <code>0xd30</code> from the page
whose physical base address is <code>0x02698000</code>, and shows all the
attributes of that page.
</p>
<p>Note that you must cast the addresses of variables to a <code>char *</code>,
since otherwise the value of <code>__djgpp_base_address</code>, the base
address of all variables and functions in a <small>DJGPP</small> program, will
be added using the rules of C pointer arithmetics: if <code>i</code> is
declared an <code>int</code>, <small>GDB</small> will add 4 times the value of
<code>__djgpp_base_address</code> to the address of <code>i</code>.
</p>
<p>Here’s another example, it displays the Page Table entry for the
transfer buffer:
</p>
<div>
<pre><code>(gdb) info dos address-pte *((unsigned *)&amp;_go32_info_block + 3)</code>
</pre><pre><code>Page Table entry for address 0x29110:</code>
</pre><pre><code>Base=0x00029000 Dirty Acc. Not-Cached Write-Back Usr Read-Write +0x110</code>
</pre></div>

<p>(The <code>+ 3</code> offset is because the transfer buffer’s address is the
3rd member of the <code>_go32_info_block</code> structure.)  The output
clearly shows that this DPMI server maps the addresses in conventional
memory 1:1, i.e. the physical (<code>0x00029000</code> + <code>0x110</code>) and
linear (<code>0x29110</code>) addresses are identical.
</p>
<p>This command is supported only with some DPMI servers.

<a name="Non_002ddebug-DLL-Symbols"></a>

<a name="Support-for-DLLs-without-Debugging-Symbols"></a>
<h4>21.1.4.1 Support for DLLs without Debugging Symbols</h4>
<a name="index-DLLs-with-no-debugging-symbols"></a>
<a name="index-Minimal-symbols-and-DLLs"></a>

<p>Very often on windows, some of the DLLs that your program relies on do
not include symbolic debugging information (for example,
<samp>kernel32.dll</samp>).  When <small>GDB</small> doesn’t recognize any debugging
symbols in a DLL, it relies on the minimal amount of symbolic
information contained in the DLL’s export table.  This section
describes working with such symbols, known internally to <small>GDB</small> as
“minimal symbols”.
</p>
<p>Note that before the debugged program has started execution, no DLLs
will have been loaded.  The easiest way around this problem is simply to
start the program — either by setting a breakpoint or letting the
program run once to completion.
</p>
<a name="DLL-Name-Prefixes"></a>
<h4>21.1.4.2 DLL Name Prefixes</h4>

<p>In keeping with the naming conventions used by the Microsoft debugging
tools, DLL export symbols are made available with a prefix based on the
DLL name, for instance <code>KERNEL32!CreateFileA</code>.  The plain name is
also entered into the symbol table, so <code>CreateFileA</code> is often
sufficient.  In some cases there will be name clashes within a program
(particularly if the executable itself includes full debugging symbols)
necessitating the use of the fully qualified name when referring to the
contents of the DLL.  Use single-quotes around the name to avoid the
exclamation mark (“!”)  being interpreted as a language operator.
</p>
<p>Note that the internal name of the DLL may be all upper-case, even
though the file name of the DLL is lower-case, or vice-versa.  Since
symbols within <small>GDB</small> are <em>case-sensitive</em> this may cause
some confusion. If in doubt, try the <code>info functions</code> and
<code>info variables</code> commands or even <code>maint print msymbols</code>
(see <a href="#Symbols">Symbols</a>). Here’s an example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) info function CreateFileA
All functions matching regular expression &#34;CreateFileA&#34;:

Non-debugging symbols:
0x77e885f4  CreateFileA
0x77e885f4  KERNEL32!CreateFileA
</pre></div>

<div>
<pre>(gdb) info function !
All functions matching regular expression &#34;!&#34;:

Non-debugging symbols:
0x6100114c  cygwin1!__assert
0x61004034  cygwin1!_dll_crt0@0
0x61004240  cygwin1!dll_crt0(per_process *)
[etc...]
</pre></div>

<a name="Working-with-Minimal-Symbols"></a>
<h4>21.1.4.3 Working with Minimal Symbols</h4>

<p>Symbols extracted from a DLL’s export table do not contain very much
type information. All that <small>GDB</small> can do is guess whether a symbol
refers to a function or variable depending on the linker section that
contains the symbol. Also note that the actual contents of the memory
contained in a DLL are not available unless the program is running. This
means that you cannot examine the contents of a variable or disassemble
a function within a DLL without a running program.
</p>
<p>Variables are generally treated as pointers and dereferenced
automatically. For this reason, it is often necessary to prefix a
variable name with the address-of operator (“&amp;”) and provide explicit
type information in the command. Here’s an example of the type of
problem:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print &#39;cygwin1!__argv&#39;
&#39;cygwin1!__argv&#39; has unknown type; cast it to its declared type
</pre></div>

<div>
<pre>(gdb) x &#39;cygwin1!__argv&#39;
&#39;cygwin1!__argv&#39; has unknown type; cast it to its declared type
</pre></div>

<p>And two possible solutions:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) print ((char **)&#39;cygwin1!__argv&#39;)[0]
$2 = 0x22fd98 &#34;/cygdrive/c/mydirectory/myprogram&#34;
</pre></div>

<div>
<pre>(gdb) x/2x &amp;&#39;cygwin1!__argv&#39;
0x610c0aa8 &lt;cygwin1!__argv&gt;:    0x10021608      0x00000000
(gdb) x/x 0x10021608
0x10021608:     0x0022fd98
(gdb) x/s 0x0022fd98
0x22fd98:        &#34;/cygdrive/c/mydirectory/myprogram&#34;
</pre></div>

<p>Setting a break point within a DLL is possible even before the program
starts execution. However, under these circumstances, <small>GDB</small> can’t
examine the initial instructions of the function in order to skip the
function’s frame set-up code. You can work around this by using “*&amp;”
to set the breakpoint at a raw memory address:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) break *&amp;&#39;python22!PyOS_Readline&#39;
Breakpoint 1 at 0x1e04eff0
</pre></div>

<p>The author of these extensions is not entirely convinced that setting a
break point within a shared DLL like <samp>kernel32.dll</samp> is completely
safe.

<dt><code>set sigs</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-signals_002c-Hurd-command"></a>
<a name="index-set-sigs_002c-Hurd-command"></a>
<p>This command toggles the state of inferior signal interception by
<small>GDB</small>.  Mach exceptions, such as breakpoint traps, are not

<dt><code>set signal-thread</code></dt>
<dt><code>set sigthread</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-signal_002dthread"></a>
<a name="index-set-sigthread"></a>
<p>This command tells <small>GDB</small> which thread is the <code>libc</code> signal
thread.  That thread is run when a signal is delivered to a running
process.  <code>set sigthread</code> is the shorthand alias of <code>set
signal-thread</code>.

<dt><code>show signal-thread</code></dt>
<dt><code>show sigthread</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show-signal_002dthread"></a>

<p>These two commands show which thread will run when the inferior is
delivered a signal.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set stopped</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-stopped_002c-Hurd-command"></a>
<p>This commands tells <small>GDB</small> that the inferior process is stopped,
as with the <code>SIGSTOP</code> signal.  The stopped process can be
continued by delivering a signal to it.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show stopped</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show-stopped_002c-Hurd-command"></a>

stopped.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set exceptions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-exceptions_002c-Hurd-command"></a>
<p>Use this command to turn off trapping of exceptions in the inferior.
When exception trapping is off, neither breakpoints nor
single-stepping will work.  To restore the default, set exception
trapping on.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show exceptions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show-exceptions_002c-Hurd-command"></a>

<a name="index-pause-current-task-_0028GNU-Hurd_0029"></a>
<p>This command toggles task suspension when <small>GDB</small> has control.
Setting it to on takes effect immediately, and the task is suspended
whenever <small>GDB</small> gets control.  Setting it to off will take
effect the next time the inferior is continued.  If this option is set
to off, you can use <code>set thread default pause on</code> or <code>set
thread pause on</code> (see below) to pause individual threads.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show task pause</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show-task_002c-Hurd-commands"></a>

<dt><code>set task excp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-task-exception-port_002c-GNU-Hurd"></a>
<p>This command sets the task exception port to which <small>GDB</small> will
forward exceptions.  The argument should be the value of the <em>send
rights</em> of the task.  <code>set task excp</code> is a shorthand alias.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set noninvasive</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-noninvasive-task-options"></a>
<p>This command switches <small>GDB</small> to a mode that is the least

<p>This command toggles current thread suspension when <small>GDB</small> has
control.  Setting it to on takes effect immediately, and the current
thread is suspended whenever <small>GDB</small> gets control.  Setting it to
off will take effect the next time the inferior is continued.
Normally, this command has no effect, since when <small>GDB</small> has
control, the whole task is suspended.  However, if you used <code>set
task pause off</code> (see above), this command comes in handy to suspend
only the current thread.

<h4>21.1.7 FreeBSD</h4>

<p>When the ABI of a system call is changed in the FreeBSD kernel, this
is implemented by leaving a compatibility system call using the old
ABI at the existing number and allocating a new system call number for
the version using the new ABI.  As a convenience, when a system call
is caught by name (see <a href="#catch-syscall">catch syscall</a>), compatibility system calls
are also caught.
</p>
<p>For example, FreeBSD 12 introduced a new variant of the <code>kevent</code>
system call and catching the <code>kevent</code> system call by name catches
both variants:
</p>

FPGAs, such as Spartan or Virtex series.  Boards with these processors
usually have JTAG ports which connect to a host system running the Xilinx
Embedded Development Kit (EDK) or Software Development Kit (SDK).
This host system is used to download the configuration bitstream to
the target FPGA.  The Xilinx Microprocessor Debugger (XMD) program
communicates with the target board using the JTAG interface and
presents a <code>gdbserver</code> interface to the board.  By default
<code>xmd</code> uses port <code>1234</code>.  (While it is possible to change 
this default port, it requires the use of undocumented <code>xmd</code> 
commands.  Contact Xilinx support if you need to do this.)

<a name="index-floating-point_002c-MIPS-remote"></a>
<p>If your target board does not support the <acronym>MIPS</acronym> floating point
coprocessor, you should use the command ‘<samp>set mipsfpu none</samp>’ (if you
need this, you may wish to put the command in your <small>GDB</small> init
file).  This tells <small>GDB</small> how to find the return value of
functions which return floating point values.  It also allows
<small>GDB</small> to avoid saving the floating point registers when calling
functions on the board.  If you are using a floating point coprocessor
with only single precision floating point support, as on the <small>R4650</small>
processor, use the command ‘<samp>set mipsfpu single</samp>’.  The default
double precision floating point coprocessor may be selected using
‘<samp>set mipsfpu double</samp>’.
</p>
<p>In previous versions the only choices were double precision or no
floating point, so ‘<samp>set mipsfpu on</samp>’ will select double precision
and ‘<samp>set mipsfpu off</samp>’ will select no floating point.

<h4>21.3.8 PowerPC Embedded</h4>

<a name="index-DVC-register"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> supports using the DVC (Data Value Compare) register to
implement in hardware simple hardware watchpoint conditions of the form:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) watch <var>address|variable</var> \
  if  <var>address|variable</var> == <var>constant expression</var>
</pre></div>

<p>The DVC register will be automatically used when <small>GDB</small> detects
such pattern in a condition expression, and the created watchpoint uses one
debug register (either the <code>exact-watchpoints</code> option is on and the
variable is scalar, or the variable has a length of one byte).  This feature
is available in native <small>GDB</small> running on a Linux kernel version 2.6.34
or newer.
</p>
<p>When running on PowerPC embedded processors, <small>GDB</small> automatically uses
ranged hardware watchpoints, unless the <code>exact-watchpoints</code> option is on,
in which case watchpoints using only one debug register are created when
watching variables of scalar types.
</p>
<p>You can create an artificial array to watch an arbitrary memory
region using one of the following commands (see <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>):
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) watch *((char *) <var>address</var>)@<var>length</var>
(gdb) watch {char[<var>length</var>]} <var>address</var>

<a name="index-ranged-breakpoint"></a>
<p>PowerPC embedded processors support hardware accelerated
<em>ranged breakpoints</em>.  A ranged breakpoint stops execution of
the inferior whenever it executes an instruction at any address within
the range it specifies.  To set a ranged breakpoint in <small>GDB</small>,
use the <code>break-range</code> command.

<a name="index-AArch64-SVE_002e"></a>

<p>When <small>GDB</small> is debugging the AArch64 architecture, if the Scalable Vector
Extension (SVE) is present, then <small>GDB</small> will provide the vector registers
<code>$z0</code> through <code>$z31</code>, vector predicate registers <code>$p0</code> through
<code>$p15</code>, and the <code>$ffr</code> register.  In addition, the pseudo register
<code>$vg</code> will be provided.  This is the vector granule for the current thread
and represents the number of 64-bit chunks in an SVE <code>z</code> register.
</p>
<p>If the vector length changes, then the <code>$vg</code> register will be updated,
but the lengths of the <code>z</code> and <code>p</code> registers will not change.  This
is a known limitation of <small>GDB</small> and does not affect the execution of the

<h4>21.4.1.2 AArch64 Pointer Authentication.</h4>
<a name="index-AArch64-Pointer-Authentication_002e"></a>

<p>When <small>GDB</small> is debugging the AArch64 architecture, and the program is
using the v8.3-A feature Pointer Authentication (PAC), then whenever the link
register <code>$lr</code> is pointing to an PAC function its value will be masked.
When GDB prints a backtrace, any addresses that required unmasking will be
postfixed with the marker [PAC].  When using the MI, this is printed as part
of the <code>addr_flags</code> field.

<h4>21.4.1.3 AArch64 Memory Tagging Extension.</h4>
<a name="index-AArch64-Memory-Tagging-Extension_002e"></a>

<p>When <small>GDB</small> is debugging the AArch64 architecture, the program is
using the v8.5-A feature Memory Tagging Extension (MTE) and there is support
in the kernel for MTE, <small>GDB</small> will make memory tagging functionality
available for inspection and editing of logical and allocation tags.
See <a href="#Memory-Tagging">Memory Tagging</a>.
</p>
<p>To aid debugging, <small>GDB</small> will output additional information when SIGSEGV
signals are generated as a result of memory tag failures.
</p>
<p>If the tag violation is synchronous, the following will be shown:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
Memory tag violation while accessing address 0x0500fffff7ff8000
Allocation tag 0x1
Logical tag 0x5.
</pre></div>

<p>If the tag violation is asynchronous, the fault address is not available.
In this case <small>GDB</small> will show the following:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
Memory tag violation
Fault address unavailable.
</pre></div>

<p>A special register, <code>tag_ctl</code>, is made available through the
<code>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.mte</code> feature.  This register exposes some
options that can be controlled at runtime and emulates the <code>prctl</code>
option <code>PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL</code>.  For further information, see the
documentation in the Linux kernel.

<a name="index-Intel-Memory-Protection-Extensions-_0028MPX_0029_002e"></a>

<p>Memory Protection Extension (MPX) adds the bound registers ‘<samp>BND0</samp>’
<a name="DOCF17" href="#FOOT17"><sup>17</sup></a> through ‘<samp>BND3</samp>’.  Bound registers store a pair of 64-bit values
which are the lower bound and upper bound.  Bounds are effective addresses or
memory locations.  The upper bounds are architecturally represented in 1’s
complement form.  A bound having lower bound = 0, and upper bound = 0
(1’s complement of all bits set) will allow access to the entire address space.
</p>
<p>‘<samp>BND0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>BND3</samp>’ are represented in <small>GDB</small> as ‘<samp>bnd0raw</samp>’
through ‘<samp>bnd3raw</samp>’.  Pseudo registers ‘<samp>bnd0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>bnd3</samp>’
display the upper bound performing the complement of one operation on the
upper bound value, i.e. when upper bound in ‘<samp>bnd0raw</samp>’ is 0 in the
<small>GDB</small> ‘<samp>bnd0</samp>’ it will be <code>0xfff…</code>.  In this sense it
can also be noted that the upper bounds are inclusive.
</p>
<p>As an example, assume that the register BND0 holds bounds for a pointer having
access allowed for the range between 0x32 and 0x71.  The values present on
bnd0raw and bnd registers are presented as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre>	bnd0raw = {0x32, 0xffffffff8e}
	bnd0 = {lbound = 0x32, ubound = 0x71} : size 64
</pre></div>

<p>This way the raw value can be accessed via bnd0raw…bnd3raw.  Any
change on bnd0…bnd3 or bnd0raw…bnd3raw is reflect on its
counterpart.  When the bnd0…bnd3 registers are displayed via
Python, the display includes the memory size, in bits, accessible to
the pointer.
</p>
<p>Bounds can also be stored in bounds tables, which are stored in
application memory.  These tables store bounds for pointers by specifying
the bounds pointer’s value along with its bounds.  Evaluating and changing
bounds located in bound tables is therefore interesting while investigating
bugs on MPX context.  <small>GDB</small> provides commands for this purpose:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>show mpx bound <var>pointer</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show-mpx-bound"></a>
<p>Display bounds of the given <var>pointer</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set mpx bound <var>pointer</var>, <var>lbound</var>, <var>ubound</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-mpx-bound"></a>
<p>Set the bounds of a pointer in the bound table.
This command takes three parameters: <var>pointer</var> is the pointers
whose bounds are to be changed, <var>lbound</var> and <var>ubound</var> are new values
for lower and upper bounds respectively.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>When you call an inferior function on an Intel MPX enabled program,
GDB sets the inferior’s bound registers to the init (disabled) state
before calling the function.  As a consequence, bounds checks for the
pointer arguments passed to the function will always pass.
</p>
<p>This is necessary because when you call an inferior function, the
program is usually in the middle of the execution of other function.
Since at that point bound registers are in an arbitrary state, not
clearing them would lead to random bound violations in the called
function.
</p>
<p>You can still examine the influence of the bound registers on the
execution of the called function by stopping the execution of the
called function at its prologue, setting bound registers, and
continuing the execution.  For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>	$ break *upper
	Breakpoint 2 at 0x4009de: file i386-mpx-call.c, line 47.
	$ print upper (a, b, c, d, 1)
	Breakpoint 2, upper (a=0x0, b=0x6e0000005b, c=0x0, d=0x0, len=48)....
	$ print $bnd0
	{lbound = 0x0, ubound = ffffffff} : size -1
</pre></div>

<p>At this last step the value of bnd0 can be changed for investigation of bound
violations caused along the execution of the call.  In order to know how to
set the bound registers or bound table for the call consult the ABI.

<a name="index-MIPS-stack"></a>
<p>Alpha- and <acronym>MIPS</acronym>-based computers use an unusual stack frame, which
sometimes requires <small>GDB</small> to search backward in the object code to
find the beginning of a function.
</p>
<a name="index-response-time_002c-MIPS-debugging"></a>
<p>To improve response time (especially for embedded applications, where
<small>GDB</small> may be restricted to a slow serial line for this search)
you may want to limit the size of this search, using one of these
commands:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

</dd>
<dt><code>set heuristic-fence-post <var>limit</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Restrict <small>GDB</small> to examining at most <var>limit</var> bytes in its
search for the beginning of a function.  A value of <var>0</var> (the
default) means there is no limit.  However, except for <var>0</var>, the
larger the limit the more bytes <code>heuristic-fence-post</code> must search
and therefore the longer it takes to run.  You should only need to use
this command when debugging a stripped executable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show heuristic-fence-post</code></dt>

</p>
<p>Possible values of <var>arg</var> are ‘<samp>mips16</samp>’ and ‘<samp>micromips</samp>’.
The default compressed <acronym title="Instruction Set Architecture">ISA</acronym> encoding is ‘<samp>mips16</samp>’, as

</p>
<p>This setting is “sticky”; that is, it retains its value across
debugging sessions until reset either explicitly with this command or

<h4>21.4.8.1 ADI Support</h4>

<p>The M7 processor supports an Application Data Integrity (ADI) feature that 
detects invalid data accesses.  When software allocates memory and enables 
ADI on the allocated memory, it chooses a 4-bit version number, sets the 
version in the upper 4 bits of the 64-bit pointer to that data, and stores 
the 4-bit version in every cacheline of that data.  Hardware saves the latter 
in spare bits in the cache and memory hierarchy.  On each load and store, 
the processor compares the upper 4 VA (virtual address) bits to the 
cacheline’s version.  If there is a mismatch, the processor generates a 
version mismatch trap which can be either precise or disrupting.  The trap 
is an error condition which the kernel delivers to the process as a SIGSEGV 
signal.
</p>
<p>Note that only 64-bit applications can use ADI and need to be built with
ADI-enabled.
</p>
<p>Values of the ADI version tags, which are in granularity of a 
cacheline (64 bytes), can be viewed or modified. 
</p>

<dl compact="compact">

<dt><code>adi (examine | x) [ / <var>n</var> ] <var>addr</var></code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>adi examine</code> command displays the value of one ADI version tag per 
cacheline. 
</p>
<p><var>n</var> is a decimal integer specifying the number in bytes; the default 
is 1.  It specifies how much ADI version information, at the ratio of 1:ADI 
block size, to display. 
</p>
<p><var>addr</var> is the address in user address space where you want <small>GDB</small>

<dt><code>adi (assign | a) [ / <var>n</var> ] <var>addr</var> = <var>tag</var></code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>adi assign</code> command is used to assign new ADI version tag 
to an address. 
</p>
<p><var>n</var> is a decimal integer specifying the number in bytes; 
the default is 1.  It specifies how much ADI version information, at the

called the <em>prompt</em>.  This string is normally ‘<samp>(gdb)</samp>’.  You
can change the prompt string with the <code>set prompt</code> command.  For
instance, when debugging <small>GDB</small> with <small>GDB</small>, it is useful to change
the prompt in one of the <small>GDB</small> sessions so that you can always tell
which one you are talking to.
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em>  <code>set prompt</code> does not add a space for you after the
prompt you set.  This allows you to set a prompt which ends in a space
or a prompt that does not.

<h3>22.3 Command History</h3>
<a name="index-command-history"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> can keep track of the commands you type during your
debugging sessions, so that you can be certain of precisely what
happened.  Use these commands to manage the <small>GDB</small> command
history facility.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> uses the <small>GNU</small> History library, a part of the Readline
package, to provide the history facility.
See <a href="#Using-History-Interactively">Using History Interactively</a>,
for the detailed description of the History library.
</p>
<p>To issue a command to <small>GDB</small> without affecting certain aspects of
the state which is seen by users, prefix it with ‘<samp>server </samp>’
(see <a href="#Server-Prefix">Server Prefix</a>).  This
means that this command will not affect the command history, nor will it
affect <small>GDB</small>’s notion of which command to repeat if <tt>RET</tt> is
pressed on a line by itself.
</p>
<a name="index-server_002c-command-prefix"></a>
<p>The server prefix does not affect the recording of values into the value
history; to print a value without recording it into the value history,
use the <code>output</code> command instead of the <code>print</code> command.
</p>
<p>Here is the description of <small>GDB</small> commands related to command
history.

<dd><p>Set the name of the <small>GDB</small> command history file to <var>fname</var>.
This is the file where <small>GDB</small> reads an initial command history
list, and where it writes the command history from this session when it
exits.  You can access this list through history expansion or through
the history command editing characters listed below.  This file defaults
to the value of the environment variable <code>GDBHISTFILE</code>, or to
<samp>./.gdb_history</samp> (<samp>./_gdb_history</samp> on MS-DOS) if this variable
is not set.
</p>
<p>The <code>GDBHISTFILE</code> environment variable is read after processing
any <small>GDB</small> initialization files (see <a href="#Startup">Startup</a>) and after
processing any commands passed using command line options (for
example, <code>-ex</code>).
</p>

<p>History expansion assigns special meaning to the character <kbd>!</kbd>.
See <a href="#Event-Designators">Event Designators</a>,

</p>
<a name="index-history-expansion_002c-turn-on_002foff"></a>
<p>Since <kbd>!</kbd> is also the logical not operator in C, history expansion
is off by default. If you decide to enable history expansion with the
<code>set history expansion on</code> command, you may sometimes need to
follow <kbd>!</kbd> (when it is used as logical not, in an expression) with
a space or a tab to prevent it from being expanded.  The readline
history facilities do not attempt substitution on the strings
<kbd>!=</kbd> and <kbd>!(</kbd>, even when history expansion is enabled.

<h3>22.4 Screen Size</h3>
<a name="index-size-of-screen"></a>
<a name="index-screen-size"></a>
<a name="index-pagination"></a>
<a name="index-page-size"></a>
<a name="index-pauses-in-output"></a>

<p>Certain commands to <small>GDB</small> may produce large amounts of
information output to the screen.  To help you read all of it,
<small>GDB</small> pauses and asks you for input at the end of each page of
output.  Type <tt>RET</tt> when you want to see one more page of output,
<kbd>q</kbd> to discard the remaining output, or <kbd>c</kbd> to continue
without paging for the rest of the current command.  Also, the screen
width setting determines when to wrap lines of output.  Depending on
what is being printed, <small>GDB</small> tries to break the line at a
readable place, rather than simply letting it overflow onto the
following line.
</p>
<p>Normally <small>GDB</small> knows the size of the screen from the terminal
driver software.  For example, on Unix <small>GDB</small> uses the termcap data base
together with the value of the <code>TERM</code> environment variable and the
<code>stty rows</code> and <code>stty cols</code> settings.  If this is not correct,
you can override it with the <code>set height</code> and <code>set
width</code> commands:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-height"></a>
<a name="index-set-width"></a>
<a name="index-show-width"></a>
<a name="index-show-height"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set height <var>lpp</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>set height unlimited</code></dt>
<dt><code>show height</code></dt>
<dt><code>set width <var>cpl</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>set width unlimited</code></dt>
<dt><code>show width</code></dt>
<dd><p>These <code>set</code> commands specify a screen height of <var>lpp</var> lines and
a screen width of <var>cpl</var> characters.  The associated <code>show</code>
commands display the current settings.
</p>
<p>If you specify a height of either <code>unlimited</code> or zero lines,
<small>GDB</small> does not pause during output no matter how long the
output is.  This is useful if output is to a file or to an editor
buffer.
</p>
<p>Likewise, you can specify ‘<samp>set width unlimited</samp>’ or ‘<samp>set
width 0</samp>’ to prevent <small>GDB</small> from wrapping its output.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set pagination on</code></dt>
<dt><code>set pagination off</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-pagination"></a>
<p>Turn the output pagination on or off; the default is on.  Turning
pagination off is the alternative to <code>set height unlimited</code>.  Note that
running <small>GDB</small> with the <samp>--batch</samp> option (see <a href="#Mode-Options">-batch</a>) also automatically disables pagination.

<a name="index-set-style"></a>
<a name="index-show-style"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> can style its output on a capable terminal.  This is
enabled by default on most systems, but disabled by default when in
batch mode (see <a href="#Mode-Options">Mode Options</a>).  Various style settings are available;
and styles can also be disabled entirely.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set style enabled ‘<samp>on|off</samp>’</code></dt>

most hosts defaulting to ‘<samp>on</samp>’.

available to <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>There are two ways that highlighting can be done.  First, if
<small>GDB</small> was linked with the GNU Source Highlight library, then it
is used.  Otherwise, if <small>GDB</small> was configured with Python
scripting support, and if the Python Pygments package is available,
then it will be used.

<dd><p>Enable or disable disassembler styling.  This affects whether
disassembler output, such as the output of the <code>disassemble</code>
command, is styled.  Disassembler styling only works if styling in
general is enabled (with <code>set style enabled on</code>), and if a source
highlighting library is available to <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>To highlight disassembler output, <small>GDB</small> must be compiled with
Python support, and the Python Pygments package must be available.  If
these requirements are not met then <small>GDB</small> will not highlight
disassembler output, even when this option is ‘<samp>on</samp>’.

<dt><code>show style disassembler enabled</code></dt>

</dl>

<p>Subcommands of <code>set style</code> control specific forms of styling.
These subcommands all follow the same pattern: each style-able object
can be styled with a foreground color, a background color, and an
intensity.
</p>
<p>For example, the style of file names can be controlled using the
<code>set style filename</code> group of commands:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set style filename background <var>color</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set the background to <var>color</var>.  Valid colors are ‘<samp>none</samp>’
(meaning the terminal’s default color), ‘<samp>black</samp>’, ‘<samp>red</samp>’,
‘<samp>green</samp>’, ‘<samp>yellow</samp>’, ‘<samp>blue</samp>’, ‘<samp>magenta</samp>’, ‘<samp>cyan</samp>’,
and‘<samp>white</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set style filename foreground <var>color</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set the foreground to <var>color</var>.  Valid colors are ‘<samp>none</samp>’
(meaning the terminal’s default color), ‘<samp>black</samp>’, ‘<samp>red</samp>’,
‘<samp>green</samp>’, ‘<samp>yellow</samp>’, ‘<samp>blue</samp>’, ‘<samp>magenta</samp>’, ‘<samp>cyan</samp>’,
and‘<samp>white</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set style filename intensity <var>value</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set the intensity to <var>value</var>.  Valid intensities are ‘<samp>normal</samp>’
(the default), ‘<samp>bold</samp>’, and ‘<samp>dim</samp>’.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The <code>show style</code> command and its subcommands are styling
a style name in their output using its own style.
So, use <code>show style</code> to see the complete list of styles,
their characteristics and the visual aspect of each style.
</p>
<p>The style-able objects are:
</p><dl compact="compact">

</p>
<p>In order to control how <small>GDB</small> styles the version number at

<h3>22.6 Numbers</h3>
<a name="index-number-representation"></a>
<a name="index-entering-numbers"></a>

<p>You can always enter numbers in octal, decimal, or hexadecimal in
<small>GDB</small> by the usual conventions: octal numbers begin with
‘<samp>0</samp>’, decimal numbers end with ‘<samp>.</samp>’, and hexadecimal numbers
begin with ‘<samp>0x</samp>’.  Numbers that neither begin with ‘<samp>0</samp>’ or
‘<samp>0x</samp>’, nor end with a ‘<samp>.</samp>’ are, by default, entered in base
10; likewise, the default display for numbers—when no particular
format is specified—is base 10.  You can change the default base for
both input and output with the commands described below.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-input_002dradix"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set input-radix <var>base</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set the default base for numeric input.  Supported choices
for <var>base</var> are decimal 8, 10, or 16.  The base must itself be
specified either unambiguously or using the current input radix; for
example, any of
</p>
<div>
<pre>set input-radix 012
set input-radix 10.
set input-radix 0xa
</pre></div>

<p>sets the input base to decimal.  On the other hand, ‘<samp>set input-radix 10</samp>’
leaves the input radix unchanged, no matter what it was, since
‘<samp>10</samp>’, being without any leading or trailing signs of its base, is
interpreted in the current radix.  Thus, if the current radix is 16,
‘<samp>10</samp>’ is interpreted in hex, i.e. as 16 decimal, which doesn’t
change the radix.

<a name="ABI"></a>

<a name="Configuring-the-Current-ABI"></a>
<h3>22.7 Configuring the Current ABI</h3>

<p><small>GDB</small> can determine the <em>ABI</em> (Application Binary Interface) of your
application automatically.  However, sometimes you need to override its
conclusions.  Use these commands to manage <small>GDB</small>’s view of the
current ABI.
</p>
<a name="index-OS-ABI"></a>
<a name="index-set-osabi"></a>
<a name="index-show-osabi"></a>
<a name="index-Newlib-OS-ABI-and-its-influence-on-the-longjmp-handling"></a>

<p>One <small>GDB</small> configuration can debug binaries for multiple operating
system targets, either via remote debugging or native emulation.
<small>GDB</small> will autodetect the <em>OS ABI</em> (Operating System ABI) in use,
but you can override its conclusion using the <code>set osabi</code> command.
One example where this is useful is in debugging of binaries which use
an alternate C library (e.g. <small>UCLIBC</small> for <small>GNU</small>/Linux) which does
not have the same identifying marks that the standard C library for your
platform provides.
</p>
<p>When <small>GDB</small> is debugging the AArch64 architecture, it provides a
“Newlib” OS ABI.  This is useful for handling <code>setjmp</code> and
<code>longjmp</code> when debugging binaries that use the <small>NEWLIB</small> C library.
The “Newlib” OS ABI can be selected by <code>set osabi Newlib</code>.

<a name="index-float-promotion"></a>

<p>Generally, the way that an argument of type <code>float</code> is passed to a
function depends on whether the function is prototyped.  For a prototyped
(i.e. ANSI/ISO style) function, <code>float</code> arguments are passed unchanged,
according to the architecture’s convention for <code>float</code>.  For unprototyped
(i.e. K&amp;R style) functions, <code>float</code> arguments are first promoted to type
<code>double</code> and then passed.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some forms of debug information do not reliably indicate whether
a function is prototyped.  If <small>GDB</small> calls a function that is not marked
as prototyped, it consults <kbd>set coerce-float-to-double</kbd>.

<h3>22.8 Automatically loading associated files</h3>
<a name="index-auto_002dloading"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> sometimes reads files with commands and settings automatically,
without being explicitly told so by the user.  We call this feature
<em>auto-loading</em>.  While auto-loading is useful for automatically adapting
<small>GDB</small> to the needs of your project, it can sometimes produce unexpected
results or introduce security risks (e.g., if the file comes from untrusted
sources).
</p>
<p>There are various kinds of files <small>GDB</small> can automatically load.
In addition to these files, <small>GDB</small> supports auto-loading code written
in various extension languages.  See <a href="#Auto_002dloading-extensions">Auto-loading extensions</a>.
</p>
<p>Note that loading of these associated files (including the local <samp>.gdbinit</samp>
file) requires accordingly configured <code>auto-load safe-path</code>
(see <a href="#Auto_002dloading-safe-path">Auto-loading safe path</a>).
</p>
<p>For these reasons, <small>GDB</small> includes commands and options to let you
control when to auto-load files and which files should be auto-loaded.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<dd><p>Globally disable loading of all auto-loaded files.
You may want to use this command with the ‘<samp>-iex</samp>’ option
(see <a href="#Option-_002dinit_002deval_002dcommand">Option -init-eval-command</a>) such as:
</p><div>

<p>Be aware that system init file (see <a href="#System_002dwide-configuration">System-wide configuration</a>)
and init files from your home directory (see <a href="#Home-Directory-Init-File">Home Directory Init File</a>)
still get read (as they come from generally trusted directories).
To prevent <small>GDB</small> from auto-loading even those init files, use the

<p>This feature is currently present only on <small>GNU</small>/Linux native hosts.

<p><small>GDB</small> reads in some cases thread debugging library from places specific
to the inferior (see <a href="#set-libthread_002ddb_002dsearch_002dpath">set libthread-db-search-path</a>).
</p>
<p>The special ‘<samp>libthread-db-search-path</samp>’ entry ‘<samp>$sdir</samp>’ is processed
without checking this ‘<samp>set auto-load libthread-db</samp>’ switch as system
libraries have to be trusted in general.  In all other cases of
‘<samp>libthread-db-search-path</samp>’ entries <small>GDB</small> checks first if ‘<samp>set
auto-load libthread-db</samp>’ is enabled before trying to open such thread debugging

<h4>22.8.3 Security restriction for auto-loading</h4>
<a name="index-auto_002dloading-safe_002dpath"></a>

<p>As the files of inferior can come from untrusted source (such as submitted by
an application user) <small>GDB</small> does not always load any files automatically.
<small>GDB</small> provides the ‘<samp>set auto-load safe-path</samp>’ setting to list
directories trusted for loading files not explicitly requested by user.
Each directory can also be a shell wildcard pattern.
</p>
<p>If the path is not set properly you will see a warning and the file will not
get loaded:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ ./gdb -q ./gdb
Reading symbols from /home/user/gdb/gdb...
warning: File &#34;/home/user/gdb/gdb-gdb.gdb&#34; auto-loading has been
         declined by your `auto-load safe-path&#39; set
         to &#34;$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load&#34;.
warning: File &#34;/home/user/gdb/gdb-gdb.py&#34; auto-loading has been
         declined by your `auto-load safe-path&#39; set
         to &#34;$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load&#34;.
</pre></div>

<p>To instruct <small>GDB</small> to go ahead and use the init files anyway,
invoke <small>GDB</small> like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>$ gdb -q -iex &#34;set auto-load safe-path /home/user/gdb&#34; ./gdb
</pre></div>

<p>The list of trusted directories is controlled by the following commands:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="set-auto_002dload-safe_002dpath"></a><a name="index-set-auto_002dload-safe_002dpath"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set auto-load safe-path <span>[</span><var>directories</var><span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set the list of directories (and their subdirectories) trusted for automatic
loading and execution of scripts.  You can also enter a specific trusted file.
Each directory can also be a shell wildcard pattern; wildcards do not match
directory separator - see <code>FNM_PATHNAME</code> for system function <code>fnmatch</code>
(see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#Wildcard-Matching">fnmatch</a> in <cite>GNU C Library Reference Manual</cite>).
If you omit <var>directories</var>, ‘<samp>auto-load safe-path</samp>’ will be reset to
its default value as specified during <small>GDB</small> compilation.
</p>
<p>The list of directories uses path separator (‘<samp>:</samp>’ on GNU and Unix
systems, ‘<samp>;</samp>’ on MS-Windows and MS-DOS) to separate directories, similarly
to the <code>PATH</code> environment variable.
</p>
<a name="show-auto_002dload-safe_002dpath"></a><a name="index-show-auto_002dload-safe_002dpath"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>show auto-load safe-path</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show the list of directories trusted for automatic loading and execution of

</dd>
<dt><code>add-auto-load-safe-path</code></dt>
<dd><p>Add an entry (or list of entries) to the list of directories trusted for
automatic loading and execution of scripts.  Multiple entries may be delimited
by the host platform path separator in use.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>This variable defaults to what <code>--with-auto-load-dir</code> has been configured
to (see <a href="#with_002dauto_002dload_002ddir">with-auto-load-dir</a>).  <samp>$debugdir</samp> and <samp>$datadir</samp>
substitution applies the same as for <a href="#set-auto_002dload-scripts_002ddirectory">set auto-load scripts-directory</a>.
The default <code>set auto-load safe-path</code> value can be also overriden by
<small>GDB</small> configuration option <samp>--with-auto-load-safe-path</samp>.
</p>
<p>Setting this variable to <samp>/</samp> disables this security protection,
corresponding <small>GDB</small> configuration option is
<samp>--without-auto-load-safe-path</samp>.
This variable is supposed to be set to the system directories writable by the
system superuser only.  Users can add their source directories in init files in
their home directories (see <a href="#Home-Directory-Init-File">Home Directory Init File</a>).  See also deprecated
init file in the current directory
(see <a href="#Init-File-in-the-Current-Directory-during-Startup">Init File in the Current Directory during Startup</a>).
</p>
<p>To force <small>GDB</small> to load the files it declined to load in the previous
example, you could use one of the following ways:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><samp>~/.gdbinit</samp>: ‘<samp>add-auto-load-safe-path ~/src/gdb</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Specify this trusted directory (or a file) as additional component of the list.
You have to specify also any existing directories displayed by
by ‘<samp>show auto-load safe-path</samp>’ (such as ‘<samp>/usr:/bin</samp>’ in this example).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>gdb -iex &#34;set auto-load safe-path /usr:/bin:~/src/gdb&#34; …</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Specify this directory as in the previous case but just for a single
<small>GDB</small> session.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>gdb -iex &#34;set auto-load safe-path /&#34; …</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Disable auto-loading safety for a single <small>GDB</small> session.
This assumes all the files you debug during this <small>GDB</small> session will come
from trusted sources.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>./configure --without-auto-load-safe-path</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>During compilation of <small>GDB</small> you may disable any auto-loading safety.
This assumes all the files you will ever debug with this <small>GDB</small> come from
trusted sources.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>On the other hand you can also explicitly forbid automatic files loading which
also suppresses any such warning messages:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><kbd>gdb -iex &#34;set auto-load no&#34; …</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>You can use <small>GDB</small> command-line option for a single <small>GDB</small> session.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><samp>~/.gdbinit</samp>: ‘<samp>set auto-load no</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Disable auto-loading globally for the user
(see <a href="#Home-Directory-Init-File">Home Directory Init File</a>).  While it is improbable, you could also
use system init file instead (see <a href="#System_002dwide-configuration">System-wide configuration</a>).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>This setting applies to the file names as entered by user.  If no entry matches
<small>GDB</small> tries as a last resort to also resolve all the file names into
their canonical form (typically resolving symbolic links) and compare the
entries again.  <small>GDB</small> already canonicalizes most of the filenames on its
own before starting the comparison so a canonical form of directories is
recommended to be entered.

<p>For better visibility of all the file locations where you can place scripts to
be auto-loaded with inferior — or to protect yourself against accidental
execution of untrusted scripts — <small>GDB</small> provides a feature for printing
all the files attempted to be loaded.  Both existing and non-existing files may
be printed.
</p>
<p>For example the list of directories from which it is safe to auto-load files
(see <a href="#Auto_002dloading-safe-path">Auto-loading safe path</a>) applies also to canonicalized filenames which
may not be too obvious while setting it up.

<h3>22.9 Optional Warnings and Messages</h3>

<a name="index-verbose-operation"></a>
<a name="index-optional-warnings"></a>
<p>By default, <small>GDB</small> is silent about its inner workings.  If you are
running on a slow machine, you may want to use the <code>set verbose</code>
command.  This makes <small>GDB</small> tell you when it does a lengthy
internal operation, so you will not think it has crashed.
</p>
<p>Currently, the messages controlled by <code>set verbose</code> are those
which announce that the symbol table for a source file is being read;
see <code>symbol-file</code> in <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<p>By default, if <small>GDB</small> encounters bugs in the symbol table of an
object file, it is silent; but if you are debugging a compiler, you may
find this information useful (see <a href="#Symbol-Errors">Errors Reading
Symbol Files</a>).
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd>
<a name="index-set-complaints"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set complaints <var>limit</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Permits <small>GDB</small> to output <var>limit</var> complaints about each type of

<div>
<pre>(gdb) run
The program being debugged has been started already.

<h2>23 Extending <small>GDB</small></h2>
<a name="index-extending-GDB"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> provides several mechanisms for extension.
<small>GDB</small> also provides the ability to automatically load
extensions when it reads a file for debugging.  This allows the
user to automatically customize <small>GDB</small> for the program
being debugged.
</p>
<p>To facilitate the use of extension languages, <small>GDB</small> is capable
of evaluating the contents of a file.  When doing so, <small>GDB</small>
can recognize which extension language is being used by looking at
the filename extension.  Files with an unrecognized filename extension
are always treated as a <small>GDB</small> Command Files.
See <a href="#Command-Files">Command files</a>.
</p>
<p>You can control how <small>GDB</small> evaluates these files with the following
setting:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-script_002dextension"></a>
<a name="index-show-script_002dextension"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set script-extension off</code></dt>
<dd><p>All scripts are always evaluated as <small>GDB</small> Command Files.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set script-extension soft</code></dt>
<dd><p>The debugger determines the scripting language based on filename
extension.  If this scripting language is supported, <small>GDB</small>
evaluates the script using that language.  Otherwise, it evaluates
the file as a <small>GDB</small> Command File.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set script-extension strict</code></dt>
<dd><p>The debugger determines the scripting language based on filename
extension, and evaluates the script using that language.  If the
language is not supported, then the evaluation fails.

<h3>23.1 Canned Sequences of Commands</h3>

<p>Aside from breakpoint commands (see <a href="#Break-Commands">Breakpoint
Command Lists</a>), <small>GDB</small> provides two ways to store sequences of
commands for execution as a unit: user-defined commands and command
files.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Define"></a>

<a name="User_002ddefined-Commands"></a>
<h4>23.1.1 User-defined Commands</h4>

<a name="index-user_002ddefined-command"></a>
<a name="index-arguments_002c-to-user_002ddefined-commands"></a>
<p>A <em>user-defined command</em> is a sequence of <small>GDB</small> commands to
which you assign a new name as a command.  This is done with the
<code>define</code> command.  User commands may accept an unlimited number of arguments
separated by whitespace.  Arguments are accessed within the user command
via <code>$arg0…$argN</code>.  A trivial example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>define adder
  print $arg0 + $arg1 + $arg2
end
</pre></div>

<p>To execute the command use:
</p>


<p>This defines the command <code>adder</code>, which prints the sum of
its three arguments.  Note the arguments are text substitutions, so they may
reference variables, use complex expressions, or even perform inferior
functions calls.
</p>
<a name="index-argument-count-in-user_002ddefined-commands"></a>
<a name="index-how-many-arguments-_0028user_002ddefined-commands_0029"></a>
<p>In addition, <code>$argc</code> may be used to find out how many arguments have
been passed.
</p>
<div>
<pre>define adder
  if $argc == 2
    print $arg0 + $arg1
  end
  if $argc == 3
    print $arg0 + $arg1 + $arg2
  end
end
</pre></div>

<p>Combining with the <code>eval</code> command (see <a href="#eval">eval</a>) makes it easier
to process a variable number of arguments:
</p>
<div>
<pre>define adder
  set $i = 0
  set $sum = 0
  while $i &lt; $argc
    eval &#34;set $sum = $sum + $arg%d&#34;, $i
    set $i = $i + 1
  end
  print $sum
end
</pre></div>

<dl compact="compact">

by that name, you are asked to confirm that you want to redefine it.
The argument <var>commandname</var> may be a bare command name consisting of letters,
numbers, dashes, dots, and underscores.  It may also start with any
predefined or user-defined prefix command.
For example, ‘<samp>define target my-target</samp>’ creates
a user-defined ‘<samp>target my-target</samp>’ command.
</p>
<p>The definition of the command is made up of other <small>GDB</small> command lines,
which are given following the <code>define</code> command.  The end of these
commands is marked by a line containing <code>end</code>.

After the <code>document</code> command is finished, <code>help</code> on command
<var>commandname</var> displays the documentation you have written.
</p>
<p>You may use the <code>document</code> command again to change the
documentation of a command.  Redefining the command with <code>define</code>
does not change the documentation.

<dt><code>define-prefix <var>commandname</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Define or mark the command <var>commandname</var> as a user-defined prefix

Note that <code>define-prefix</code> can be used with a not yet defined
<var>commandname</var>.  In such a case, <var>commandname</var> is defined as
an empty user-defined command.
In case you redefine a command that was marked as a user-defined
prefix command, the subcommands of the redefined command are kept

<h4>23.1.2 User-defined Command Hooks</h4>
<a name="index-command-hooks"></a>
<a name="index-hooks_002c-for-commands"></a>
<a name="index-hooks_002c-pre_002dcommand"></a>

<a name="index-hook"></a>
<p>You may define <em>hooks</em>, which are a special kind of user-defined
command.  Whenever you run the command ‘<samp>foo</samp>’, if the user-defined
command ‘<samp>hook-foo</samp>’ exists, it is executed (with no arguments)
before that command.
</p>
<a name="index-hooks_002c-post_002dcommand"></a>
<a name="index-hookpost"></a>
<p>A hook may also be defined which is run after the command you executed.
Whenever you run the command ‘<samp>foo</samp>’, if the user-defined command
‘<samp>hookpost-foo</samp>’ exists, it is executed (with no arguments) after
that command.  Post-execution hooks may exist simultaneously with
pre-execution hooks, for the same command.
</p>
<p>It is valid for a hook to call the command which it hooks.  If this
occurs, the hook is not re-executed, thereby avoiding infinite recursion.
</p>

<a name="index-stop_002c-a-pseudo_002dcommand"></a>
<p>In addition, a pseudo-command, ‘<samp>stop</samp>’ exists.  Defining
(‘<samp>hook-stop</samp>’) makes the associated commands execute every time
execution stops in your program: before breakpoint commands are run,
displays are printed, or the stack frame is printed.
</p>
<p>For example, to ignore <code>SIGALRM</code> signals while
single-stepping, but treat them normally during normal execution,
you could define:
</p>
<div>
<pre>define hook-stop
handle SIGALRM nopass
end

define hook-run
handle SIGALRM pass
end

define hook-continue
handle SIGALRM pass
end
</pre></div>

<p>As a further example, to hook at the beginning and end of the <code>echo</code>
command, and to add extra text to the beginning and end of the message,
you could define:
</p>
<div>
<pre>define hook-echo
echo &lt;&lt;&lt;---
end

define hookpost-echo
echo ---&gt;&gt;&gt;\n
end

(gdb) echo Hello World
&lt;&lt;&lt;---Hello World---&gt;&gt;&gt;
(gdb)

</pre></div>

<p>You can define a hook for any single-word command in <small>GDB</small>, but
not for command aliases; you should define a hook for the basic command
name, e.g.  <code>backtrace</code> rather than <code>bt</code>.
You can hook a multi-word command by adding <code>hook-</code> or
<code>hookpost-</code> to the last word of the command, e.g.
‘<samp>define target hook-remote</samp>’ to add a hook to ‘<samp>target remote</samp>’.
</p>
<p>If an error occurs during the execution of your hook, execution of
<small>GDB</small> commands stops and <small>GDB</small> issues a prompt
(before the command that you actually typed had a chance to run).
</p>
<p>If you try to define a hook which does not match any known command, you
get a warning from the <code>define</code> command.

<h4>23.1.3 Command Files</h4>

<a name="index-command-files"></a>
<a name="index-scripting-commands"></a>
<p>A command file for <small>GDB</small> is a text file made of lines that are
<small>GDB</small> commands.  Comments (lines starting with <kbd>#</kbd>) may
also be included.  An empty line in a command file does nothing; it
does not mean to repeat the last command, as it would from the
terminal.
</p>
<p>You can request the execution of a command file with the <code>source</code>
command.  Note that the <code>source</code> command is also used to evaluate
scripts that are not Command Files.  The exact behavior can be configured
using the <code>script-extension</code> setting.
See <a href="#Extending-GDB">Extending GDB</a>.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-source"></a>
<a name="index-execute-commands-from-a-file"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>source [-s] [-v] <var>filename</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Execute the command file <var>filename</var>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The lines in a command file are generally executed sequentially,
unless the order of execution is changed by one of the
<em>flow-control commands</em> described below.  The commands are not
printed as they are executed.  An error in any command terminates
execution of the command file and control is returned to the console.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> first searches for <var>filename</var> in the current directory.
If the file is not found there, and <var>filename</var> does not specify a
directory, then <small>GDB</small> also looks for the file on the source search path
(specified with the ‘<samp>directory</samp>’ command);
except that <samp>$cdir</samp> is not searched because the compilation directory
is not relevant to scripts.
</p>
<p>If <code>-s</code> is specified, then <small>GDB</small> searches for <var>filename</var>
on the search path even if <var>filename</var> specifies a directory.
The search is done by appending <var>filename</var> to each element of the
search path.  So, for example, if <var>filename</var> is <samp>mylib/myscript</samp>
and the search path contains <samp>/home/user</samp> then <small>GDB</small> will
look for the script <samp>/home/user/mylib/myscript</samp>.
The search is also done if <var>filename</var> is an absolute path.
For example, if <var>filename</var> is <samp>/tmp/myscript</samp> and
the search path contains <samp>/home/user</samp> then <small>GDB</small> will
look for the script <samp>/home/user/tmp/myscript</samp>.
For DOS-like systems, if <var>filename</var> contains a drive specification,
it is stripped before concatenation.  For example, if <var>filename</var> is
<samp>d:myscript</samp> and the search path contains <samp>c:/tmp</samp> then <small>GDB</small>
will look for the script <samp>c:/tmp/myscript</samp>.
</p>
<p>If <code>-v</code>, for verbose mode, is given then <small>GDB</small> displays
each command as it is executed.  The option must be given before
<var>filename</var>, and is interpreted as part of the filename anywhere else.
</p>
<p>Commands that would ask for confirmation if used interactively proceed
without asking when used in a command file.  Many <small>GDB</small> commands that
normally print messages to say what they are doing omit the messages
when called from command files.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> also accepts command input from standard input.  In this
mode, normal output goes to standard output and error output goes to
standard error.  Errors in a command file supplied on standard input do
not terminate execution of the command file—execution continues with
the next command.
</p>


<p>(The syntax above will vary depending on the shell used.) This example
will execute commands from the file <samp>cmds</samp>. All output and errors
would be directed to <samp>log</samp>.
</p>
<p>Since commands stored on command files tend to be more general than
commands typed interactively, they frequently need to deal with
complicated situations, such as different or unexpected values of
variables and symbols, changes in how the program being debugged is
built, etc.  <small>GDB</small> provides a set of flow-control commands to
deal with these complexities.  Using these commands, you can write
complex scripts that loop over data structures, execute commands
conditionally, etc.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-if"></a>
<a name="index-else"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>if</code></dt>
<dt><code>else</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command allows to include in your script conditionally executed
commands. The <code>if</code> command takes a single argument, which is an
expression to evaluate.  It is followed by a series of commands that
are executed only if the expression is true (its value is nonzero).
There can then optionally be an <code>else</code> line, followed by a series
of commands that are only executed if the expression was false.  The
end of the list is marked by a line containing <code>end</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-while"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>while</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command allows to write loops.  Its syntax is similar to
<code>if</code>: the command takes a single argument, which is an expression
to evaluate, and must be followed by the commands to execute, one per
line, terminated by an <code>end</code>.  These commands are called the
<em>body</em> of the loop.  The commands in the body of <code>while</code> are
executed repeatedly as long as the expression evaluates to true.
</p>
<a name="index-loop_005fbreak"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>loop_break</code></dt>

<a name="Output"></a>

<a name="Commands-for-Controlled-Output"></a>
<h4>23.1.4 Commands for Controlled Output</h4>

<p>During the execution of a command file or a user-defined command, normal
<small>GDB</small> output is suppressed; the only output that appears is what is
explicitly printed by the commands in the definition.  This section
describes three commands useful for generating exactly the output you
want.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-echo"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>echo <var>text</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Print <var>text</var>.  Nonprinting characters can be included in
<var>text</var> using C escape sequences, such as ‘<samp>\n</samp>’ to print a
newline.  <strong>No newline is printed unless you specify one.</strong>
In addition to the standard C escape sequences, a backslash followed
by a space stands for a space.  This is useful for displaying a
string with spaces at the beginning or the end, since leading and
trailing spaces are otherwise trimmed from all arguments.
To print ‘<samp> <!-- /@w -->and foo = <!-- /@w --></samp>’, use the command
‘<samp>echo \ <!-- /@w -->and foo = \ <!-- /@w --></samp>’.
</p>
<p>A backslash at the end of <var>text</var> can be used, as in C, to continue
the command onto subsequent lines.  For example,
</p>
<div>
<pre>echo This is some text\n\
which is continued\n\
onto several lines.\n
</pre></div>

<p>produces the same output as
</p>
<div>
<pre>echo This is some text\n
echo which is continued\n
echo onto several lines.\n
</pre></div>

<a name="index-output"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>output <var>expression</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the value of <var>expression</var> and nothing but that value: no
newlines, no ‘<samp>$<var>nn</var> = </samp>’.  The value is not entered in the
value history either.  See <a href="#Expressions">Expressions</a>, for more information
on expressions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>output/<var>fmt</var> <var>expression</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the value of <var>expression</var> in format <var>fmt</var>.  You can use
the same formats as for <code>print</code>.  See <a href="#Output-Formats">Output
Formats</a>, for more information.
</p>
<a name="index-printf"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>printf <var>template</var>, <var>expressions</var>…</code></dt>
<dd><p>Print the values of one or more <var>expressions</var> under the control of
the string <var>template</var>.  To print several values, make
<var>expressions</var> be a comma-separated list of individual expressions,
which may be either numbers or pointers.  Their values are printed as
specified by <var>template</var>, exactly as a C program would do by
executing the code below:
</p>
<div>
<pre>printf (<var>template</var>, <var>expressions</var>…);
</pre></div>

<p>As in <code>C</code> <code>printf</code>, ordinary characters in <var>template</var>
are printed verbatim, while <em>conversion specification</em> introduced
by the ‘<samp>%</samp>’ character cause subsequent <var>expressions</var> to be
evaluated, their values converted and formatted according to type and
style information encoded in the conversion specifications, and then
printed.
</p>
<p>For example, you can print two values in hex like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>printf &#34;foo, bar-foo = 0x%x, 0x%x\n&#34;, foo, bar-foo
</pre></div>

<p><code>printf</code> supports all the standard <code>C</code> conversion
specifications, including the flags and modifiers between the ‘<samp>%</samp>’
character and the conversion letter, with the following exceptions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The argument-ordering modifiers, such as ‘<samp>2$</samp>’, are not supported.

</li><li> The modifier ‘<samp>*</samp>’ is not supported for specifying precision or
width.

</li><li> The ‘<samp>&#39;</samp>’ flag (for separation of digits into groups according to
<code>LC_NUMERIC&#39;</code>) is not supported.

</li><li> The type modifiers ‘<samp>hh</samp>’, ‘<samp>j</samp>’, ‘<samp>t</samp>’, and ‘<samp>z</samp>’ are not
supported.

</li><li> The conversion letter ‘<samp>n</samp>’ (as in ‘<samp>%n</samp>’) is not supported.

</li><li> The conversion letters ‘<samp>a</samp>’ and ‘<samp>A</samp>’ are not supported.
</li></ul>

<p>Note that the ‘<samp>ll</samp>’ type modifier is supported only if the
underlying <code>C</code> implementation used to build <small>GDB</small> supports
the <code>long long int</code> type, and the ‘<samp>L</samp>’ type modifier is
supported only if <code>long double</code> type is available.
</p>
<p>As in <code>C</code>, <code>printf</code> supports simple backslash-escape
sequences, such as <code>\n</code>, ‘<samp>\t</samp>’, ‘<samp>\\</samp>’, ‘<samp>\&#34;</samp>’,
‘<samp>\a</samp>’, and ‘<samp>\f</samp>’, that consist of backslash followed by a
single character.  Octal and hexadecimal escape sequences are not
supported.
</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>printf</code> supports conversion specifications for DFP
(<em>Decimal Floating Point</em>) types using the following length modifiers
together with a floating point specifier.
letters:
</p>
<ul>
<li> ‘<samp>H</samp>’ for printing <code>Decimal32</code> types.

</li><li> ‘<samp>D</samp>’ for printing <code>Decimal64</code> types.

</li><li> ‘<samp>DD</samp>’ for printing <code>Decimal128</code> types.
</li></ul>

<p>If the underlying <code>C</code> implementation used to build <small>GDB</small> has
support for the three length modifiers for DFP types, other modifiers
such as width and precision will also be available for <small>GDB</small> to use.
</p>
<p>In case there is no such <code>C</code> support, no additional modifiers will be
available and the value will be printed in the standard way.
</p>
<p>Here’s an example of printing DFP types using the above conversion letters:
</p><div>
<pre>printf &#34;D32: %Hf - D64: %Df - D128: %DDf\n&#34;,1.2345df,1.2E10dd,1.2E1dl

<a name="Aliases"></a>

<a name="Command-Aliases"></a>
<h3>23.2 Command Aliases</h3>
<a name="index-aliases-for-commands"></a>

<p>Aliases allow you to define alternate spellings for existing commands.
For example, if a new <small>GDB</small> command defined in Python
(see <a href="#Python">Python</a>) has a long name, it is handy to have an abbreviated
version of it that involves less typing.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> itself uses aliases.  For example ‘<samp>s</samp>’ is an alias
of the ‘<samp>step</samp>’ command even though it is otherwise an ambiguous
abbreviation of other commands like ‘<samp>set</samp>’ and ‘<samp>show</samp>’.
</p>
<p>Aliases are also used to provide shortened or more common versions
of multi-word commands.  For example, <small>GDB</small> provides the
‘<samp>tty</samp>’ alias of the ‘<samp>set inferior-tty</samp>’ command.
</p>
<p>You can define a new alias with the ‘<samp>alias</samp>’ command.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd>
<a name="index-alias"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>alias [-a] [--] <var>alias</var> = <var>command</var> [<var>default-args</var>]</code></dt>
</dl>

<p><var>alias</var> specifies the name of the new alias.  Each word of
<var>alias</var> must consist of letters, numbers, dashes and underscores.
</p>
<p><var>command</var> specifies the name of an existing command
that is being aliased.
</p>
<p><var>command</var> can also be the name of an existing alias.  In this
case, <var>command</var> cannot be an alias that has default arguments.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>-a</samp>’ option specifies that the new alias is an abbreviation
of the command.  Abbreviations are not used in command completion.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>--</samp>’ option specifies the end of options,
and is useful when <var>alias</var> begins with a dash.
</p>
<p>You can specify <var>default-args</var> for your alias.  These
<var>default-args</var> will be automatically added before the alias
arguments typed explicitly on the command line.
</p>
<p>For example, the below defines an alias <code>btfullall</code> that shows all local
variables and all frame arguments:
</p><div>
<pre>(gdb) alias btfullall = backtrace -full -frame-arguments all
</pre></div>

<p>For more information about <var>default-args</var>, see <a href="#Command-aliases-default-args">Default Arguments</a>.
</p>
<p>Here is a simple example showing how to make an abbreviation of a
command so that there is less to type.  Suppose you were tired of
typing ‘<samp>disas</samp>’, the current shortest unambiguous abbreviation of
the ‘<samp>disassemble</samp>’ command and you wanted an even shorter version
named ‘<samp>di</samp>’.  The following will accomplish this.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) alias -a di = disas
</pre></div>

<p>Note that aliases are different from user-defined commands.  With a
user-defined command, you also need to write documentation for it with
the ‘<samp>document</samp>’ command.  An alias automatically picks up the
documentation of the existing command.
</p>
<p>Here is an example where we make ‘<samp>elms</samp>’ an abbreviation of
‘<samp>elements</samp>’ in the ‘<samp>set print elements</samp>’ command.
This is to show that you can make an abbreviation of any part
of a command.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) alias -a set print elms = set print elements
(gdb) alias -a show print elms = show print elements
(gdb) set p elms 200
(gdb) show p elms
Limit on string chars or array elements to print is 200.
</pre></div>

<p>Note that if you are defining an alias of a ‘<samp>set</samp>’ command,
and you want to have an alias for the corresponding ‘<samp>show</samp>’
command, then you need to define the latter separately.
</p>
<p>Unambiguously abbreviated commands are allowed in <var>command</var> and
<var>alias</var>, just as they are normally.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) alias -a set pr elms = set p ele
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, here is an example showing the creation of a one word
alias for a more complex command.
This creates alias ‘<samp>spe</samp>’ of the command ‘<samp>set print elements</samp>’.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) alias spe = set print elements
(gdb) spe 20
</pre></div>



<hr/>
<a name="Command-aliases-default-args"></a>

<a name="Default-Arguments"></a>
<h4>23.2.1 Default Arguments</h4>
<a name="index-aliases-for-commands_002c-default-arguments"></a>

<p>You can tell <small>GDB</small> to always prepend some default arguments to
the list of arguments provided explicitly by the user when using a
user-defined alias.
</p>
<p>If you repeatedly use the same arguments or options for a command, you
can define an alias for this command and tell <small>GDB</small> to
automatically prepend these arguments or options to the list of
arguments you type explicitly when using the alias<a name="DOCF18" href="#FOOT18"><sup>18</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>For example, if you often use the command <code>thread apply all</code>
specifying to work on the threads in ascending order and to continue in case it
encounters an error, you can tell <small>GDB</small> to automatically preprend
the <code>-ascending</code> and <code>-c</code> options by using:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) alias thread apply asc-all = thread apply all -ascending -c
</pre></div>

<p>Once you have defined this alias with its default args, any time you type
the <code>thread apply asc-all</code> followed by <code>some arguments</code>,
<small>GDB</small> will execute  <code>thread apply all -ascending -c some arguments</code>.
</p>
<p>To have even less to type, you can also define a one word alias:
</p><div>
<pre>(gdb) alias t_a_c = thread apply all -ascending -c
</pre></div>

<p>As usual, unambiguous abbreviations can be used for <var>alias</var>
and <var>default-args</var>.
</p>
<p>The different aliases of a command do not share their default args.
For example, you define a new alias <code>bt_ALL</code> showing all possible
information and another alias <code>bt_SMALL</code> showing very limited information
using:
</p><div>
<pre>(gdb) alias bt_ALL = backtrace -entry-values both -frame-arg all \
   -past-main -past-entry -full
(gdb) alias bt_SMALL = backtrace -entry-values no -frame-arg none \
   -past-main off -past-entry off
</pre></div>

<p>(For more on using the <code>alias</code> command, see <a href="#Aliases">Aliases</a>.)
</p>
<p>Default args are not limited to the arguments and options of <var>command</var>,
but can specify nested commands if <var>command</var> accepts such a nested command
as argument.
For example, the below defines <code>faalocalsoftype</code> that lists the
frames having locals of a certain type, together with the matching
local vars:
</p><div>
<pre>(gdb) alias faalocalsoftype = frame apply all info locals -q -t
(gdb) faalocalsoftype int
#1  0x55554f5e in sleeper_or_burner (v=0xdf50) at sleepers.c:86
i = 0
ret = 21845
</pre></div>

<p>This is also very useful to define an alias for a set of nested <code>with</code>
commands to have a particular combination of temporary settings.  For example,
the below defines the alias <code>pp10</code> that pretty prints an expression
argument, with a maximum of 10 elements if the expression is a string or
an array:
</p><div>
<pre>(gdb) alias pp10 = with print pretty -- with print elements 10 -- print
</pre></div>
<p>This defines the alias  <code>pp10</code> as being a sequence of 3 commands.
The first part <code>with print pretty --</code> temporarily activates the setting
<code>set print pretty</code>, then launches the command that follows the separator
<code>--</code>.
The command following the first part is also a <code>with</code> command that
temporarily changes the setting <code>set print elements</code> to 10, then
launches the command that follows the second separator <code>--</code>.
The third part <code>print</code> is the command the <code>pp10</code> alias will launch,
using the temporary values of the settings and the arguments explicitly given
by the user.
For more information about the <code>with</code> command usage,
see <a href="#Command-Settings">Command Settings</a>.

<h4>23.3.2.1 Basic Python</h4>

<a name="index-python-stdout"></a>
<a name="index-python-pagination"></a>
<p>At startup, <small>GDB</small> overrides Python’s <code>sys.stdout</code> and
<code>sys.stderr</code> to print using <small>GDB</small>’s output-paging streams.
A Python program which outputs to one of these streams may have its
output interrupted by the user (see <a href="#Screen-Size">Screen Size</a>).  In this
situation, a Python <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> exception is thrown.
</p>
<p>Some care must be taken when writing Python code to run in
<small>GDB</small>.  Two things worth noting in particular:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <small>GDB</small> install handlers for <code>SIGCHLD</code> and <code>SIGINT</code>.
Python code must not override these, or even change the options using
<code>sigaction</code>.  If your program changes the handling of these
signals, <small>GDB</small> will most likely stop working correctly.  Note
that it is unfortunately common for GUI toolkits to install a
<code>SIGCHLD</code> handler.

</li><li> <small>GDB</small> takes care to mark its internal file descriptors as
close-on-exec.  However, this cannot be done in a thread-safe way on
all platforms.  Your Python programs should be aware of this and
should both create new file descriptors with the close-on-exec flag
set and arrange to close unneeded file descriptors before starting a
child process.
</li></ul>

<h4>23.3.2.2 Exception Handling</h4>
<a name="index-python-exceptions"></a>
<a name="index-exceptions_002c-python"></a>

<p>When executing the <code>python</code> command, Python exceptions
uncaught within the Python code are translated to calls to
<small>GDB</small> error-reporting mechanism.  If the command that called
<code>python</code> does not handle the error, <small>GDB</small> will
terminate it and print an error message containing the Python
exception name, the associated value, and the Python call stack
backtrace at the point where the exception was raised.  Example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) python print foo
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &#34;&lt;string&gt;&#34;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
NameError: name &#39;foo&#39; is not defined
</pre></div>

<p><small>GDB</small> errors that happen in <small>GDB</small> commands invoked by
Python code are converted to Python exceptions.  The type of the
Python exception depends on the error.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>gdb.error</code>
<a name="index-gdb_002eerror"></a>
</dt>
<dd><p>This is the base class for most exceptions generated by <small>GDB</small>.
It is derived from <code>RuntimeError</code>, for compatibility with earlier
versions of <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>If an error occurring in <small>GDB</small> does not fit into some more
specific category, then the generated exception will have this type.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gdb.MemoryError</code>
<a name="index-gdb_002eMemoryError"></a>
</dt>
<dd><p>This is a subclass of <code>gdb.error</code> which is thrown when an
operation tried to access invalid memory in the inferior.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>KeyboardInterrupt</code>
<a name="index-KeyboardInterrupt"></a>
</dt>
<dd><p>User interrupt (via <kbd>C-c</kbd> or by typing <kbd>q</kbd> at a pagination
prompt) is translated to a Python <code>KeyboardInterrupt</code> exception.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>In all cases, your exception handler will see the <small>GDB</small> error
message as its value and the Python call stack backtrace at the Python
statement closest to where the <small>GDB</small> error occured as the
traceback.
</p>

<p>When implementing <small>GDB</small> commands in Python via
<code>gdb.Command</code>, or functions via <code>gdb.Function</code>, it is useful
to be able to throw an exception that doesn’t cause a traceback to be
printed.  For example, the user may have invoked the command
incorrectly.  <small>GDB</small> provides a special exception class that can
be used for this purpose.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>gdb.GdbError</code>
<a name="index-gdb_002eGdbError"></a>
</dt>
<dd><p>When thrown from a command or function, this exception will cause the
command or function to fail, but the Python stack will not be
displayed.  <small>GDB</small> does not throw this exception itself, but
rather recognizes it when thrown from user Python code.  Example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) python
&gt;class HelloWorld (gdb.Command):
&gt;  &#34;&#34;&#34;Greet the whole world.&#34;&#34;&#34;
&gt;  def __init__ (self):

&gt;  def invoke (self, args, from_tty):
&gt;    argv = gdb.string_to_argv (args)
&gt;    if len (argv) != 0:
&gt;      raise gdb.GdbError (&#34;hello-world takes no arguments&#34;)
&gt;    print (&#34;Hello, World!&#34;)
&gt;HelloWorld ()
&gt;end
(gdb) hello-world 42

<h4>23.3.2.3 Values From Inferior</h4>
<a name="index-values-from-inferior_002c-with-Python"></a>
<a name="index-python_002c-working-with-values-from-inferior"></a>

<a name="index-gdb_002eValue"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> provides values it obtains from the inferior program in
an object of type <code>gdb.Value</code>.  <small>GDB</small> uses this object
for its internal bookkeeping of the inferior’s values, and for
fetching values when necessary.
</p>
<p>Inferior values that are simple scalars can be used directly in
Python expressions that are valid for the value’s data type.  Here’s
an example for an integer or floating-point value <code>some_val</code>:
</p>


<p>As result of this, <code>bar</code> will also be a <code>gdb.Value</code> object
whose values are of the same type as those of <code>some_val</code>.  Valid
Python operations can also be performed on <code>gdb.Value</code> objects
representing a <code>struct</code> or <code>class</code> object.  For such cases,
the overloaded operator (if present), is used to perform the operation.
For example, if <code>val1</code> and <code>val2</code> are <code>gdb.Value</code> objects
representing instances of a <code>class</code> which overloads the <code>+</code>
operator, then one can use the <code>+</code> operator in their Python script
as follows:
</p>


<p>The result of the operation <code>val3</code> is also a <code>gdb.Value</code>
object corresponding to the value returned by the overloaded <code>+</code>
operator.  In general, overloaded operators are invoked for the
following operations: <code>+</code> (binary addition), <code>-</code> (binary
subtraction), <code>*</code> (multiplication), <code>/</code>, <code>%</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>,
<code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>^</code>.
</p>
<p>Inferior values that are structures or instances of some class can
be accessed using the Python <em>dictionary syntax</em>.  For example, if
<code>some_val</code> is a <code>gdb.Value</code> instance holding a structure, you
can access its <code>foo</code> element with:
</p>


<a name="index-getting-structure-elements-using-gdb_002eField-objects-as-subscripts"></a>
<p>Again, <code>bar</code> will also be a <code>gdb.Value</code> object.  Structure
elements can also be accessed by using <code>gdb.Field</code> objects as
subscripts (see <a href="#Types-In-Python">Types In Python</a>, for more information on
<code>gdb.Field</code> objects).  For example, if <code>foo_field</code> is a
<code>gdb.Field</code> object corresponding to element <code>foo</code> of the above
structure, then <code>bar</code> can also be accessed as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre>bar = some_val[foo_field]
</pre></div>

<p>A <code>gdb.Value</code> that represents a function can be executed via
inferior function call.  Any arguments provided to the call must match
the function’s prototype, and must be provided in the order specified
by that prototype.
</p>
<p>For example, <code>some_val</code> is a <code>gdb.Value</code> instance
representing a function that takes two integers as arguments.  To
execute this function, call it like so:
</p>
<div>
<pre>result = some_val (10,20)
</pre></div>

<p>Any values returned from a function call will be stored as a
<code>gdb.Value</code>.
</p>
<p>The following attributes are provided:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Value_002eaddress"></a>Variable: <strong>Value.address</strong></dt>

value is of class type, it will return the class in which the value is
embedded, if any.  If this value is of pointer or reference to a class
type, it will compute the dynamic type of the referenced object, and
return a pointer or reference to that type, respectively.  In all
other cases, it will return the value’s static type.
</p>
<p>Note that this feature will only work when debugging a C<tt>++</tt> program
that includes <acronym>RTTI</acronym> for the object in question.  Otherwise,

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Value_002edereference"></a>Function: <strong>Value.dereference</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>For pointer data types, this method returns a new <code>gdb.Value</code> object

<p>then you can use the corresponding <code>gdb.Value</code> to access what
<code>foo</code> points to like this:
</p>


<p>The result <code>bar</code> will be a <code>gdb.Value</code> object holding the
value pointed to by <code>foo</code>.
</p>
<p>A similar function <code>Value.referenced_value</code> exists which also
returns <code>gdb.Value</code> objects corresponding to the values pointed to
by pointer values (and additionally, values referenced by reference
values).  However, the behavior of <code>Value.dereference</code>
differs from <code>Value.referenced_value</code> by the fact that the
behavior of <code>Value.dereference</code> is identical to applying the C
unary operator <code>*</code> on a given value.  For example, consider a
reference to a pointer <code>ptrref</code>, declared in your C<tt>++</tt> program
as
</p>
<div>
<pre>typedef int *intptr;
...
int val = 10;
intptr ptr = &amp;val;
intptr &amp;ptrref = ptr;
</pre></div>

<p>Though <code>ptrref</code> is a reference value, one can apply the method
<code>Value.dereference</code> to the <code>gdb.Value</code> object corresponding
to it and obtain a <code>gdb.Value</code> which is identical to that
corresponding to <code>val</code>.  However, if you apply the method
<code>Value.referenced_value</code>, the result would be a <code>gdb.Value</code>
object identical to that corresponding to <code>ptr</code>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>py_ptrref = gdb.parse_and_eval (&#34;ptrref&#34;)
py_val = py_ptrref.dereference ()
py_ptr = py_ptrref.referenced_value ()
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>gdb.Value</code> object <code>py_val</code> is identical to that
corresponding to <code>val</code>, and <code>py_ptr</code> is identical to that
corresponding to <code>ptr</code>.  In general, <code>Value.dereference</code> can
be applied whenever the C unary operator <code>*</code> can be applied
to the corresponding C value.  For those cases where applying both
<code>Value.dereference</code> and <code>Value.referenced_value</code> is allowed,
the results obtained need not be identical (as we have seen in the above
example).  The results are however identical when applied on
<code>gdb.Value</code> objects corresponding to pointers (<code>gdb.Value</code>
objects with type code <code>TYPE_CODE_PTR</code>) in a C/C<tt>++</tt> program.

<p>Values are interpreted as strings according to the rules of the
current language.  If the optional length argument is given, the
string will be converted to that length, and will include any embedded
zeroes that the string may contain.  Otherwise, for languages
where the string is zero-terminated, the entire string will be
converted.
</p>
<p>For example, in C-like languages, a value is a string if it is a pointer
to or an array of characters or ints of type <code>wchar_t</code>, <code>char16_t</code>,
or <code>char32_t</code>.
</p>
<p>If the optional <var>encoding</var> argument is given, it must be a string
naming the encoding of the string in the <code>gdb.Value</code>, such as
<code>&#34;ascii&#34;</code>, <code>&#34;iso-8859-6&#34;</code> or <code>&#34;utf-8&#34;</code>.  It accepts
the same encodings as the corresponding argument to Python’s
<code>string.decode</code> method, and the Python codec machinery will be used
to convert the string.  If <var>encoding</var> is not given, or if
<var>encoding</var> is the empty string, then either the <code>target-charset</code>
(see <a href="#Character-Sets">Character Sets</a>) will be used, or a language-specific encoding
will be used, if the current language is able to supply one.
</p>
<p>The optional <var>errors</var> argument is the same as the corresponding
argument to Python’s <code>string.decode</code> method.
</p>
<p>If the optional <var>length</var> argument is given, the string will be
fetched and converted to the given length.

converts the contents to a <code>gdb.LazyString</code> (see <a href="#Lazy-Strings-In-Python">Lazy Strings In Python</a>).  Otherwise, this method will throw an exception.
</p>
<p>If the optional <var>encoding</var> argument is given, it must be a string
naming the encoding of the <code>gdb.LazyString</code>.  Some examples are:
‘<samp>ascii</samp>’, ‘<samp>iso-8859-6</samp>’ or ‘<samp>utf-8</samp>’.  If the
<var>encoding</var> argument is an encoding that <small>GDB</small> does
recognize, <small>GDB</small> will raise an error.
</p>
<p>When a lazy string is printed, the <small>GDB</small> encoding machinery is
used to convert the string during printing.  If the optional
<var>encoding</var> argument is not provided, or is an empty string,
<small>GDB</small> will automatically select the encoding most suitable for
the string type.  For further information on encoding in <small>GDB</small>
please see <a href="#Character-Sets">Character Sets</a>.
</p>
<p>If the optional <var>length</var> argument is given, the string will be
fetched and encoded to the length of characters specified.  If
the <var>length</var> argument is not provided, the string will be fetched
and encoded until a null of appropriate width is found.

<h4>23.3.2.4 Types In Python</h4>
<a name="index-types-in-Python"></a>
<a name="index-Python_002c-working-with-types"></a>

<a name="index-gdb_002eType"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> represents types from the inferior using the class
<code>gdb.Type</code>.
</p>
<p>The following type-related functions are available in the <code>gdb</code>
module:
</p>
<a name="index-gdb_002elookup_005ftype"></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_002elookup_005ftype-1"></a>Function: <strong>gdb.lookup_type</strong> <em>(name <span>[</span>, block<span>]</span>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function looks up a type by its <var>name</var>, which must be a string.
</p>
<p>If <var>block</var> is given, then <var>name</var> is looked up in that scope.
Otherwise, it is searched for globally.
</p>
<p>Ordinarily, this function will return an instance of <code>gdb.Type</code>.
If the named type cannot be found, it will throw an exception.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Integer types can be found without looking them up by name.
See <a href="#Architectures-In-Python">Architectures In Python</a>, for the <code>integer_type</code> method.
</p>
<p>If the type is a structure or class type, or an enum type, the fields
of that type can be accessed using the Python <em>dictionary syntax</em>.
For example, if <code>some_type</code> is a <code>gdb.Type</code> instance holding
a structure type, you can access its <code>foo</code> field with:
</p>


<p><code>bar</code> will be a <code>gdb.Field</code> object; see below under the
description of the <code>Type.fields</code> method for a description of the
<code>gdb.Field</code> class.
</p>
<p>An instance of <code>Type</code> has the following attributes:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002ealignof"></a>Variable: <strong>Type.alignof</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The alignment of this type, in bytes.  Type alignment comes from the
debugging information; if it was not specified, then <small>GDB</small> will
use the relevant ABI to try to determine the alignment.  In some
cases, even this is not possible, and zero will be returned.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002ecode"></a>Variable: <strong>Type.code</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The type code for this type.  The type code will be one of the
<code>TYPE_CODE_</code> constants defined below.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002edynamic"></a>Variable: <strong>Type.dynamic</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A boolean indicating whether this type is dynamic.  In some
situations, such as Rust <code>enum</code> types or Ada variant records, the
concrete type of a value may vary depending on its contents.  That is,
the declared type of a variable, or the type returned by
<code>gdb.lookup_type</code> may be dynamic; while the type of the
variable’s value will be a concrete instance of that dynamic type.
</p>
<p>For example, consider this code:
</p>

<p>Here, at least conceptually (whether your compiler actually does this
is a separate issue), examining <code><span>gdb.lookup_symbol(&#34;array&#34;,</span> ...).type</code><!-- /@w -->
could yield a <code>gdb.Type</code> which reports a size of <code>None</code>.
This is the dynamic type.
</p>
<p>However, examining <code>gdb.parse_and_eval(&#34;array&#34;).type</code> would yield
a concrete type, whose length would be known.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002ename"></a>Variable: <strong>Type.name</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The name of this type.  If this type has no name, then <code>None</code>
is returned.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002esizeof"></a>Variable: <strong>Type.sizeof</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The size of this type, in target <code>char</code> units.  Usually, a
target’s <code>char</code> type will be an 8-bit byte.  However, on some
unusual platforms, this type may have a different size.  A dynamic
type may not have a fixed size; in this case, this attribute’s value
will be <code>None</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002etag"></a>Variable: <strong>Type.tag</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The tag name for this type.  The tag name is the name after
<code>struct</code>, <code>union</code>, or <code>enum</code> in C and C<tt>++</tt>; not all
languages have this concept.  If this type has no tag name, then
<code>None</code> is returned.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002eobjfile"></a>Variable: <strong>Type.objfile</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>gdb.Objfile</code> that this type was defined in, or <code>None</code> if
there is no associated objfile.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002eis_005fscalar"></a>Variable: <strong>Type.is_scalar</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This property is <code>True</code> if the type is a scalar type, otherwise,
this property is <code>False</code>.  Examples of non-scalar types include
structures, unions, and classes.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002eis_005fsigned"></a>Variable: <strong>Type.is_signed</strong></dt>
<dd><p>For scalar types (those for which <code>Type.is_scalar</code> is
<code>True</code>), this property is <code>True</code> if the type is signed,
otherwise this property is <code>False</code>.
</p>
<p>Attempting to read this property for a non-scalar type (a type for
which <code>Type.is_scalar</code> is <code>False</code>), will raise a
<code>ValueError</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The following methods are provided:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002efields"></a>Function: <strong>Type.fields</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Return the fields of this type.  The behavior depends on the type code:
</p>
<ul>
<li> For structure and union types, this method returns the fields.

</li><li> Range types have two fields, the minimum and maximum values.

</li><li> Enum types have one field per enum constant.

</li><li> Function and method types have one field per parameter.  The base types of
C<tt>++</tt> classes are also represented as fields.

</li><li> Array types have one field representing the array’s range.

</li><li> If the type does not fit into one of these categories, a <code>TypeError</code>
is raised.

</li></ul>

<p>Each field is a <code>gdb.Field</code> object, with some pre-defined attributes:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>bitpos</code></dt>
<dd><p>This attribute is not available for <code>enum</code> or <code>static</code>
(as in C<tt>++</tt>) fields.  The value is the position, counting
in bits, from the start of the containing type.  Note that, in a
dynamic type, the position of a field may not be constant.  In this
case, the value will be <code>None</code>.  Also, a dynamic type may have
fields that do not appear in a corresponding concrete type.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>enumval</code></dt>
<dd><p>This attribute is only available for <code>enum</code> fields, and its value
is the enumeration member’s integer representation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>name</code></dt>
<dd><p>The name of the field, or <code>None</code> for anonymous fields.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>artificial</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is <code>True</code> if the field is artificial, usually meaning that
it was provided by the compiler and not the user.  This attribute is
always provided, and is <code>False</code> if the field is not artificial.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>is_base_class</code></dt>
<dd><p>This is <code>True</code> if the field represents a base class of a C<tt>++</tt>
structure.  This attribute is always provided, and is <code>False</code>
if the field is not a base class of the type that is the argument of
<code>fields</code>, or if that type was not a C<tt>++</tt> class.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>bitsize</code></dt>
<dd><p>If the field is packed, or is a bitfield, then this will have a
non-zero value, which is the size of the field in bits.  Otherwise,
this will be zero; in this case the field’s size is given by its type.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>type</code></dt>
<dd><p>The type of the field.  This is usually an instance of <code>Type</code>,
but it can be <code>None</code> in some situations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>parent_type</code></dt>
<dd><p>The type which contains this field.  This is an instance of
<code>gdb.Type</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002earray"></a>Function: <strong>Type.array</strong> <em>(<var>n1</var> <span>[</span>, <var>n2</var><span>]</span>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>gdb.Type</code> object which represents an array of this
type.  If one argument is given, it is the inclusive upper bound of
the array; in this case the lower bound is zero.  If two arguments are
given, the first argument is the lower bound of the array, and the
second argument is the upper bound of the array.  An array’s length
must not be negative, but the bounds can be.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002evector"></a>Function: <strong>Type.vector</strong> <em>(<var>n1</var> <span>[</span>, <var>n2</var><span>]</span>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>gdb.Type</code> object which represents a vector of this
type.  If one argument is given, it is the inclusive upper bound of
the vector; in this case the lower bound is zero.  If two arguments are
given, the first argument is the lower bound of the vector, and the
second argument is the upper bound of the vector.  A vector’s length
must not be negative, but the bounds can be.
</p>
<p>The difference between an <code>array</code> and a <code>vector</code> is that
arrays behave like in C: when used in expressions they decay to a pointer
to the first element whereas vectors are treated as first class values.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002econst"></a>Function: <strong>Type.const</strong> <em>()</em></dt>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002evolatile"></a>Function: <strong>Type.volatile</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>gdb.Type</code> object which represents a

</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002eunqualified"></a>Function: <strong>Type.unqualified</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>gdb.Type</code> object which represents an unqualified
variant of this type.  That is, the result is neither <code>const</code> nor
<code>volatile</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002erange"></a>Function: <strong>Type.range</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a Python <code>Tuple</code> object that contains two elements: the
low bound of the argument type and the high bound of that type.  If
the type does not have a range, <small>GDB</small> will raise a
<code>gdb.error</code> exception (see <a href="#Exception-Handling">Exception Handling</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002ereference"></a>Function: <strong>Type.reference</strong> <em>()</em></dt>

type.

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002epointer"></a>Function: <strong>Type.pointer</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>gdb.Type</code> object which represents a pointer to this
type.

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002estrip_005ftypedefs"></a>Function: <strong>Type.strip_typedefs</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>gdb.Type</code> that represents the real type,
after removing all layers of typedefs.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Type_002etarget"></a>Function: <strong>Type.target</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>gdb.Type</code> object which represents the target type
of this type.
</p>
<p>For a pointer type, the target type is the type of the pointed-to
object.  For an array type (meaning C-like arrays), the target type is
the type of the elements of the array.  For a function or method type,
the target type is the type of the return value.  For a complex type,
the target type is the type of the elements.  For a typedef, the
target type is the aliased type.

<p>If the type does not have a target, this method will throw an
exception.

return a new <code>gdb.Value</code> or <code>gdb.Type</code> which represents the
value of the <var>n</var>th template argument (indexed starting at 0).
</p>
<p>If this <code>gdb.Type</code> is not a template type, or if the type has fewer
than <var>n</var> template arguments, this will throw an exception.
Ordinarily, only C<tt>++</tt> code will have template types.

<p>If <var>block</var> is given, then <var>name</var> is looked up in that scope.
Otherwise, it is searched for globally.

<dd><p>Return <code>gdb.Value</code> instance of this type whose value is optimized
out.  This allows a frame decorator to indicate that the value of an
argument or a local variable is not known.

<h4>23.3.2.5 Pretty Printing API</h4>
<a name="index-python-pretty-printing-api"></a>

<p>A pretty-printer is just an object that holds a value and implements a
specific interface, defined here.  An example output is provided
(see <a href="#Pretty-Printing">Pretty Printing</a>).
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-pretty_005fprinter_002echildren"></a>Function: <strong>pretty_printer.children</strong> <em>(self)</em></dt>
<dd><p><small>GDB</small> will call this method on a pretty-printer to compute the
children of the pretty-printer’s value.
</p>
<p>This method must return an object conforming to the Python iterator
protocol.  Each item returned by the iterator must be a tuple holding
two elements.  The first element is the “name” of the child; the
second element is the child’s value.  The value can be any Python
object which is convertible to a <small>GDB</small> value.
</p>
<p>This method is optional.  If it does not exist, <small>GDB</small> will act
as though the value has no children.
</p>
<p>For efficiency, the <code>children</code> method should lazily compute its
results.  This will let <small>GDB</small> read as few elements as
necessary, for example when various print settings (see <a href="#Print-Settings">Print Settings</a>) or <code>-var-list-children</code> (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Variable-Objects">GDB/MI Variable Objects</a>) limit the number of elements to be displayed.
</p>
<p>Children may be hidden from display based on the value of ‘<samp>set
print max-depth</samp>’ (see <a href="#Print-Settings">Print Settings</a>).

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-pretty_005fprinter_002edisplay_005fhint"></a>Function: <strong>pretty_printer.display_hint</strong> <em>(self)</em></dt>
<dd><p>The CLI may call this method and use its result to change the
formatting of a value.  The result will also be supplied to an MI
consumer as a ‘<samp>displayhint</samp>’ attribute of the variable being
printed.
</p>
<p>This method is optional.  If it does exist, this method must return a
string or the special value <code>None</code>.
</p>
<p>Some display hints are predefined by <small>GDB</small>:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>array</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Indicate that the object being printed is “array-like”.  The CLI
uses this to respect parameters such as <code>set print elements</code> and
<code>set print array</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>map</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Indicate that the object being printed is “map-like”, and that the
children of this value can be assumed to alternate between keys and
values.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>string</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Indicate that the object being printed is “string-like”.  If the
printer’s <code>to_string</code> method returns a Python string of some
kind, then <small>GDB</small> will call its internal language-specific
string-printing function to format the string.  For the CLI this means
adding quotation marks, possibly escaping some characters, respecting
<code>set print elements</code>, and the like.
</p></dd>

representation of the value passed to the object’s constructor.
</p>
<p>When printing from the CLI, if the <code>to_string</code> method exists,
then <small>GDB</small> will prepend its result to the values returned by
<code>children</code>.  Exactly how this formatting is done is dependent on
the display hint, and may change as more hints are added.  Also,
depending on the print settings (see <a href="#Print-Settings">Print Settings</a>), the CLI may
print just the result of <code>to_string</code> in a stack trace, omitting
the result of <code>children</code>.
</p>
<p>If this method returns a string, it is printed verbatim.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, if this method returns an instance of <code>gdb.Value</code>,
then <small>GDB</small> prints this value.  This may result in a call to
another pretty-printer.
</p>
<p>If instead the method returns a Python value which is convertible to a
<code>gdb.Value</code>, then <small>GDB</small> performs the conversion and prints
the resulting value.  Again, this may result in a call to another
pretty-printer.  Python scalars (integers, floats, and booleans) and
strings are convertible to <code>gdb.Value</code>; other types are not.
</p>
<p>Finally, if this method returns <code>None</code> then no further operations
are peformed in this method and nothing is printed.
</p>
<p>If the result is not one of these types, an exception is raised.

<h4>23.3.2.6 Selecting Pretty-Printers</h4>
<a name="index-selecting-python-pretty_002dprinters"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> provides several ways to register a pretty-printer:
globally, per program space, and per objfile.  When choosing how to
register your pretty-printer, a good rule is to register it with the
smallest scope possible: that is prefer a specific objfile first, then
a program space, and only register a printer globally as a last
resort.
</p>
<a name="index-gdb_002epretty_005fprinters"></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_002epretty_005fprinters-1"></a>Variable: <strong>gdb.pretty_printers</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The Python list <code>gdb.pretty_printers</code> contains an array of
functions or callable objects that have been registered via addition
as a pretty-printer.  Printers in this list are called <code>global</code>
printers, they’re available when debugging all inferiors.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Each <code>gdb.Progspace</code> contains a <code>pretty_printers</code> attribute.
Each <code>gdb.Objfile</code> also contains a <code>pretty_printers</code>
attribute.
</p>
<p>Each function on these lists is passed a single <code>gdb.Value</code>
argument and should return a pretty-printer object conforming to the
interface definition above (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing-API">Pretty Printing API</a>).  If a function
cannot create a pretty-printer for the value, it should return
<code>None</code>.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> first checks the <code>pretty_printers</code> attribute of each
<code>gdb.Objfile</code> in the current program space and iteratively calls
each enabled lookup routine in the list for that <code>gdb.Objfile</code>
until it receives a pretty-printer object.
If no pretty-printer is found in the objfile lists, <small>GDB</small> then
searches the pretty-printer list of the current program space,
calling each enabled function until an object is returned.
After these lists have been exhausted, it tries the global
<code>gdb.pretty_printers</code> list, again calling each enabled function until an
object is returned.
</p>
<p>The order in which the objfiles are searched is not specified.  For a
given list, functions are always invoked from the head of the list,
and iterated over sequentially until the end of the list, or a printer
object is returned.
</p>
<p>For various reasons a pretty-printer may not work.
For example, the underlying data structure may have changed and
the pretty-printer is out of date.
</p>
<p>The consequences of a broken pretty-printer are severe enough that
<small>GDB</small> provides support for enabling and disabling individual
printers.  For example, if <code>print frame-arguments</code> is on,
a backtrace can become highly illegible if any argument is printed
with a broken printer.
</p>
<p>Pretty-printers are enabled and disabled by attaching an <code>enabled</code>
attribute to the registered function or callable object.  If this attribute
is present and its value is <code>False</code>, the printer is disabled, otherwise
the printer is enabled.

<h4>23.3.2.7 Writing a Pretty-Printer</h4>
<a name="index-writing-a-pretty_002dprinter"></a>

<p>A pretty-printer consists of two parts: a lookup function to detect
if the type is supported, and the printer itself.
</p>
<p>Here is an example showing how a <code>std::string</code> printer might be
written.  See <a href="#Pretty-Printing-API">Pretty Printing API</a>, for details on the API this class
must provide.
</p>
<div>
<pre>class StdStringPrinter(object):
    &#34;Print a std::string&#34;

    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val

    def to_string(self):
        return self.val[&#39;_M_dataplus&#39;][&#39;_M_p&#39;]

    def display_hint(self):
        return &#39;string&#39;
</pre></div>

<p>And here is an example showing how a lookup function for the printer
example above might be written.
</p>
<div>
<pre>def str_lookup_function(val):
    lookup_tag = val.type.tag
    if lookup_tag is None:
        return None
    regex = re.compile(&#34;^std::basic_string&lt;char,.*&gt;$&#34;)
    if regex.match(lookup_tag):
        return StdStringPrinter(val)
    return None
</pre></div>

<p>The example lookup function extracts the value’s type, and attempts to
match it to a type that it can pretty-print.  If it is a type the
printer can pretty-print, it will return a printer object.  If not, it
returns <code>None</code>.
</p>
<p>We recommend that you put your core pretty-printers into a Python
package.  If your pretty-printers are for use with a library, we
further recommend embedding a version number into the package name.
This practice will enable <small>GDB</small> to load multiple versions of
your pretty-printers at the same time, because they will have
different names.
</p>
<p>You should write auto-loaded code (see <a href="#Python-Auto_002dloading">Python Auto-loading</a>) such that it
can be evaluated multiple times without changing its meaning.  An
ideal auto-load file will consist solely of <code>import</code>s of your
printer modules, followed by a call to a register pretty-printers with
the current objfile.
</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, this approach will scale nicely to multiple
inferiors, each potentially using a different library version.
Embedding a version number in the Python package name will ensure that
<small>GDB</small> is able to load both sets of printers simultaneously.
Then, because the search for pretty-printers is done by objfile, and
because your auto-loaded code took care to register your library’s
printers with a specific objfile, <small>GDB</small> will find the correct
printers for the specific version of the library used by each
inferior.
</p>
<p>To continue the <code>std::string</code> example (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing-API">Pretty Printing API</a>),
this code might appear in <code>gdb.libstdcxx.v6</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>def register_printers(objfile):
    objfile.pretty_printers.append(str_lookup_function)
</pre></div>

<p>And then the corresponding contents of the auto-load file would be:
</p>
<div>
<pre>import gdb.libstdcxx.v6
gdb.libstdcxx.v6.register_printers(gdb.current_objfile())
</pre></div>

<p>The previous example illustrates a basic pretty-printer.
There are a few things that can be improved on.
The printer doesn’t have a name, making it hard to identify in a
list of installed printers.  The lookup function has a name, but
lookup functions can have arbitrary, even identical, names.
</p>
<p>Second, the printer only handles one type, whereas a library typically has
several types.  One could install a lookup function for each desired type
in the library, but one could also have a single lookup function recognize
several types.  The latter is the conventional way this is handled.
If a pretty-printer can handle multiple data types, then its
<em>subprinters</em> are the printers for the individual data types.
</p>
<p>The <code>gdb.printing</code> module provides a formal way of solving these
problems (see <a href="#gdb_002eprinting">gdb.printing</a>).
Here is another example that handles multiple types.
</p>
<p>These are the types we are going to pretty-print:
</p>
<div>
<pre>struct foo { int a, b; };
struct bar { struct foo x, y; };
</pre></div>

<p>Here are the printers:
</p>
<div>
<pre>class fooPrinter:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Print a foo object.&#34;&#34;&#34;

    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val

    def to_string(self):
        return (&#34;a=&lt;&#34; + str(self.val[&#34;a&#34;]) +
                &#34;&gt; b=&lt;&#34; + str(self.val[&#34;b&#34;]) + &#34;&gt;&#34;)

class barPrinter:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Print a bar object.&#34;&#34;&#34;

    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val

    def to_string(self):
        return (&#34;x=&lt;&#34; + str(self.val[&#34;x&#34;]) +
                &#34;&gt; y=&lt;&#34; + str(self.val[&#34;y&#34;]) + &#34;&gt;&#34;)
</pre></div>

<p>This example doesn’t need a lookup function, that is handled by the
<code>gdb.printing</code> module.  Instead a function is provided to build up
the object that handles the lookup.
</p>
<div>
<pre>import gdb.printing

def build_pretty_printer():
    pp = gdb.printing.RegexpCollectionPrettyPrinter(
        &#34;my_library&#34;)
    pp.add_printer(&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;^foo$&#39;, fooPrinter)
    pp.add_printer(&#39;bar&#39;, &#39;^bar$&#39;, barPrinter)
    return pp
</pre></div>

<p>And here is the autoload support:
</p>
<div>
<pre>import gdb.printing
import my_library
gdb.printing.register_pretty_printer(
    gdb.current_objfile(),
    my_library.build_pretty_printer())
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, when this printer is loaded into <small>GDB</small>, here is the
corresponding output of ‘<samp>info pretty-printer</samp>’:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) info pretty-printer
my_library.so:
  my_library
    foo
    bar
</pre></div>

<h4>23.3.2.8 Type Printing API</h4>
<a name="index-type-printing-API-for-Python"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> provides a way for Python code to customize type display.
This is mainly useful for substituting canonical typedef names for
types.
</p>
<a name="index-type-printer"></a>
<p>A <em>type printer</em> is just a Python object conforming to a certain
protocol.  A simple base class implementing the protocol is provided;
see <a href="#gdb_002etypes">gdb.types</a>.  A type printer must supply at least:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-enabled-of-type_005fprinter"></a>Instance Variable of type_printer: <strong>enabled</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A boolean which is True if the printer is enabled, and False
otherwise.  This is manipulated by the <code>enable type-printer</code>
and <code>disable type-printer</code> commands.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-name-of-type_005fprinter"></a>Instance Variable of type_printer: <strong>name</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The name of the type printer.  This must be a string.  This is used by
the <code>enable type-printer</code> and <code>disable type-printer</code>
commands.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-instantiate-on-type_005fprinter"></a>Method on type_printer: <strong>instantiate</strong> <em>(self)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This is called by <small>GDB</small> at the start of type-printing.  It is
only called if the type printer is enabled.  This method must return a
new object that supplies a <code>recognize</code> method, as described below.
</p></dd></dl>


<p>When displaying a type, say via the <code>ptype</code> command, <small>GDB</small>
will compute a list of type recognizers.  This is done by iterating
first over the per-objfile type printers (see <a href="#Objfiles-In-Python">Objfiles In Python</a>),
followed by the per-progspace type printers (see <a href="#Progspaces-In-Python">Progspaces In Python</a>), and finally the global type printers.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> will call the <code>instantiate</code> method of each enabled
type printer.  If this method returns <code>None</code>, then the result is
ignored; otherwise, it is appended to the list of recognizers.
</p>
<p>Then, when <small>GDB</small> is going to display a type name, it iterates
over the list of recognizers.  For each one, it calls the recognition
function, stopping if the function returns a non-<code>None</code> value.
The recognition function is defined as:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-recognize-on-type_005frecognizer"></a>Method on type_recognizer: <strong>recognize</strong> <em>(self, type)</em></dt>
<dd><p>If <var>type</var> is not recognized, return <code>None</code>.  Otherwise,
return a string which is to be printed as the name of <var>type</var>.
The <var>type</var> argument will be an instance of <code>gdb.Type</code>
(see <a href="#Types-In-Python">Types In Python</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<p><small>GDB</small> uses this two-pass approach so that type printers can
efficiently cache information without holding on to it too long.  For
example, it can be convenient to look up type information in a type
printer and hold it for a recognizer’s lifetime; if a single pass were
done then type printers would have to make use of the event system in
order to avoid holding information that could become stale as the
inferior changed.

<a name="Frame-Filter-API"></a>

<a name="Filtering-Frames"></a>
<h4>23.3.2.9 Filtering Frames</h4>
<a name="index-frame-filters-api"></a>

<p>Frame filters are Python objects that manipulate the visibility of a
frame or frames when a backtrace (see <a href="#Backtrace">Backtrace</a>) is printed by
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>Only commands that print a backtrace, or, in the case of <small>GDB/MI</small>
commands (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI">GDB/MI</a>), those that return a collection of frames
are affected.  The commands that work with frame filters are:
</p>
<p><code>backtrace</code> (see <a href="#backtrace_002dcommand">The backtrace command</a>),
<code>-stack-list-frames</code>
(see <a href="#g_t_002dstack_002dlist_002dframes">The -stack-list-frames command</a>),
<code>-stack-list-variables</code> (see <a href="#g_t_002dstack_002dlist_002dvariables">The
-stack-list-variables command</a>), <code>-stack-list-arguments</code>
see <a href="#g_t_002dstack_002dlist_002darguments">The -stack-list-arguments command</a>) and
<code>-stack-list-locals</code> (see <a href="#g_t_002dstack_002dlist_002dlocals">The
-stack-list-locals command</a>).
</p>
<p>A frame filter works by taking an iterator as an argument, applying
actions to the contents of that iterator, and returning another
iterator (or, possibly, the same iterator it was provided in the case
where the filter does not perform any operations).  Typically, frame
filters utilize tools such as the Python’s <code>itertools</code> module to
work with and create new iterators from the source iterator.
Regardless of how a filter chooses to apply actions, it must not alter
the underlying <small>GDB</small> frame or frames, or attempt to alter the
call-stack within <small>GDB</small>.  This preserves data integrity within
<small>GDB</small>.  Frame filters are executed on a priority basis and care
should be taken that some frame filters may have been executed before,
and that some frame filters will be executed after.
</p>
<p>An important consideration when designing frame filters, and well
worth reflecting upon, is that frame filters should avoid unwinding
the call stack if possible.  Some stacks can run very deep, into the
tens of thousands in some cases.  To search every frame when a frame
filter executes may be too expensive at that step.  The frame filter
cannot know how many frames it has to iterate over, and it may have to
iterate through them all.  This ends up duplicating effort as
<small>GDB</small> performs this iteration when it prints the frames.  If
the filter can defer unwinding frames until frame decorators are
executed, after the last filter has executed, it should.  See <a href="#Frame-Decorator-API">Frame Decorator API</a>, for more information on decorators.  Also, there are
examples for both frame decorators and filters in later chapters.
See <a href="#Writing-a-Frame-Filter">Writing a Frame Filter</a>, for more information.
</p>
<p>The Python dictionary <code>gdb.frame_filters</code> contains key/object
pairings that comprise a frame filter.  Frame filters in this
dictionary are called <code>global</code> frame filters, and they are
available when debugging all inferiors.  These frame filters must
register with the dictionary directly.  In addition to the
<code>global</code> dictionary, there are other dictionaries that are loaded
with different inferiors via auto-loading (see <a href="#Python-Auto_002dloading">Python Auto-loading</a>).  The two other areas where frame filter dictionaries
can be found are: <code>gdb.Progspace</code> which contains a
<code>frame_filters</code> dictionary attribute, and each <code>gdb.Objfile</code>
object which also contains a <code>frame_filters</code> dictionary
attribute.
</p>
<p>When a command is executed from <small>GDB</small> that is compatible with
frame filters, <small>GDB</small> combines the <code>global</code>,
<code>gdb.Progspace</code> and all <code>gdb.Objfile</code> dictionaries currently
loaded.  All of the <code>gdb.Objfile</code> dictionaries are combined, as
several frames, and thus several object files, might be in use.
<small>GDB</small> then prunes any frame filter whose <code>enabled</code>
attribute is <code>False</code>.  This pruned list is then sorted according
to the <code>priority</code> attribute in each filter.
</p>
<p>Once the dictionaries are combined, pruned and sorted, <small>GDB</small>
creates an iterator which wraps each frame in the call stack in a
<code>FrameDecorator</code> object, and calls each filter in order.  The
output from the previous filter will always be the input to the next
filter, and so on.
</p>
<p>Frame filters have a mandatory interface which each frame filter must
implement, defined here:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-FrameFilter_002efilter"></a>Function: <strong>FrameFilter.filter</strong> <em>(iterator)</em></dt>
<dd><p><small>GDB</small> will call this method on a frame filter when it has
reached the order in the priority list for that filter.
</p>
<p>For example, if there are four frame filters:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Name         Priority

Filter1      5
Filter2      10
Filter3      100
Filter4      1
</pre></div>

<p>The order that the frame filters will be called is:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Filter3 -&gt; Filter2 -&gt; Filter1 -&gt; Filter4
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the output from <code>Filter3</code> is passed to the input of
<code>Filter2</code>, and so on.
</p>
<p>This <code>filter</code> method is passed a Python iterator.  This iterator
contains a sequence of frame decorators that wrap each
<code>gdb.Frame</code>, or a frame decorator that wraps another frame
decorator.  The first filter that is executed in the sequence of frame
filters will receive an iterator entirely comprised of default
<code>FrameDecorator</code> objects.  However, after each frame filter is
executed, the previous frame filter may have wrapped some or all of
the frame decorators with their own frame decorator.  As frame
decorators must also conform to a mandatory interface, these
decorators can be assumed to act in a uniform manner (see <a href="#Frame-Decorator-API">Frame Decorator API</a>).
</p>
<p>This method must return an object conforming to the Python iterator
protocol.  Each item in the iterator must be an object conforming to
the frame decorator interface.  If a frame filter does not wish to
perform any operations on this iterator, it should return that
iterator untouched.
</p>
<p>This method is not optional.  If it does not exist, <small>GDB</small> will
raise and print an error.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-FrameFilter_002ename"></a>Variable: <strong>FrameFilter.name</strong></dt>

attribute is mandatory.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-FrameFilter_002eenabled"></a>Variable: <strong>FrameFilter.enabled</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>enabled</code> attribute must be Python boolean.  This attribute

when any of the backtrace commands detailed earlier in this chapter

<h4>23.3.2.10 Decorating Frames</h4>
<a name="index-frame-decorator-api"></a>

<p>Frame decorators are sister objects to frame filters (see <a href="#Frame-Filter-API">Frame Filter API</a>).  Frame decorators are applied by a frame filter and can
only be used in conjunction with frame filters.
</p>
<p>The purpose of a frame decorator is to customize the printed content
of each <code>gdb.Frame</code> in commands where frame filters are executed.
This concept is called decorating a frame.  Frame decorators decorate
a <code>gdb.Frame</code> with Python code contained within each API call.
This separates the actual data contained in a <code>gdb.Frame</code> from
the decorated data produced by a frame decorator.  This abstraction is
necessary to maintain integrity of the data contained in each
<code>gdb.Frame</code>.
</p>
<p>Frame decorators have a mandatory interface, defined below.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> already contains a frame decorator called
<code>FrameDecorator</code>.  This contains substantial amounts of
boilerplate code to decorate the content of a <code>gdb.Frame</code>.  It is
recommended that other frame decorators inherit and extend this
object, and only to override the methods needed.
</p>
<a name="index-gdb_002eFrameDecorator"></a>
<p><code>FrameDecorator</code> is defined in the Python module
<code>gdb.FrameDecorator</code>, so your code can import it like:
</p><div>
<pre>from gdb.FrameDecorator import FrameDecorator
</pre></div>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-FrameDecorator_002eelided"></a>Function: <strong>FrameDecorator.elided</strong> <em>(self)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The <code>elided</code> method groups frames together in a hierarchical
system.  An example would be an interpreter, where multiple low-level
frames make up a single call in the interpreted language.  In this
example, the frame filter would elide the low-level frames and present
a single high-level frame, representing the call in the interpreted
language, to the user.
</p>
<p>The <code>elided</code> function must return an iterable and this iterable
must contain the frames that are being elided wrapped in a suitable
frame decorator.  If no frames are being elided this function may
return an empty iterable, or <code>None</code>.  Elided frames are indented
from normal frames in a <code>CLI</code> backtrace, or in the case of
<small>GDB/MI</small>, are placed in the <code>children</code> field of the eliding
frame.
</p>
<p>It is the frame filter’s task to also filter out the elided frames from
the source iterator.  This will avoid printing the frame twice.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-FrameDecorator_002efunction"></a>Function: <strong>FrameDecorator.function</strong> <em>(self)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This method returns the name of the function in the frame that is to
be printed.
</p>
<p>This method must return a Python string describing the function, or

</p>
<p>This method must return a Python numeric integer type of sufficient
size to describe the address of the frame, or <code>None</code>.

<p>If this function returns a <code>None</code>, <small>GDB</small> will not print
any data for this field.

<p>This method must return a Python string containing the filename and

<dd>
<p>This method returns the line number associated with the current
position within the function addressed by this frame.
</p>
<p>This method must return a Python integer type, or <code>None</code>.
</p>
<p>If this function returns a <code>None</code>, <small>GDB</small> will not print
any data for this field.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-FrameDecorator_002eframe_005fargs"></a>Function: <strong>FrameDecorator.frame_args</strong> <em>(self)</em></dt>
<dd><a name="frame_005fargs"></a>
<p>This method must return an iterable, or <code>None</code>.  Returning an
empty iterable, or <code>None</code> means frame arguments will not be
printed for this frame.  This iterable must contain objects that
implement two methods, described here.
</p>
<p>This object must implement a <code>symbol</code> method which takes a
single <code>self</code> parameter and must return a <code>gdb.Symbol</code>
(see <a href="#Symbols-In-Python">Symbols In Python</a>), or a Python string.  The object must also
implement a <code>value</code> method which takes a single <code>self</code>
parameter and must return a <code>gdb.Value</code> (see <a href="#Values-From-Inferior">Values From Inferior</a>), a Python value, or <code>None</code>.  If the <code>value</code>
method returns <code>None</code>, and the <code>argument</code> method returns a
<code>gdb.Symbol</code>, <small>GDB</small> will look-up and print the value of
the <code>gdb.Symbol</code> automatically.
</p>
<p>A brief example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>class SymValueWrapper():

    def __init__(self, symbol, value):
        self.sym = symbol
        self.val = value

    def value(self):
        return self.val

    def symbol(self):
        return self.sym

class SomeFrameDecorator()
...
...
    def frame_args(self):
        args = []
        try:
            block = self.inferior_frame.block()
        except:
            return None

        # Iterate over all symbols in a block.  Only add
        # symbols that are arguments.
        for sym in block:
            if not sym.is_argument:
                continue
            args.append(SymValueWrapper(sym,None))

        # Add example synthetic argument.
        args.append(SymValueWrapper(``foo&#39;&#39;, 42))

        return args
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-FrameDecorator_002eframe_005flocals"></a>Function: <strong>FrameDecorator.frame_locals</strong> <em>(self)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>This method must return an iterable or <code>None</code>.  Returning an
empty iterable, or <code>None</code> means frame local arguments will not be
printed for this frame.
</p>
<p>The object interface, the description of the various strategies for
reading frame locals, and the example are largely similar to those
described in the <code>frame_args</code> function, (see <a href="#frame_005fargs">The

                continue
            vars.append(SymValueWrapper(sym,None))

        # Add an example of a synthetic local variable.

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-FrameDecorator_002einferior_005fframe"></a>Function: <strong>FrameDecorator.inferior_frame</strong> <em>(self):</em></dt>

<a name="Writing-a-Frame-Filter"></a>

<a name="Writing-a-Frame-Filter-1"></a>
<h4>23.3.2.11 Writing a Frame Filter</h4>
<a name="index-writing-a-frame-filter"></a>

<p>There are three basic elements that a frame filter must implement: it
must correctly implement the documented interface (see <a href="#Frame-Filter-API">Frame Filter API</a>), it must register itself with <small>GDB</small>, and finally, it must
decide if it is to work on the data provided by <small>GDB</small>.  In all
cases, whether it works on the iterator or not, each frame filter must
return an iterator.  A bare-bones frame filter follows the pattern in
the following example.
</p>
<div>
<pre>import gdb

class FrameFilter():

    def __init__(self):
        # Frame filter attribute creation.
        #
        # &#39;name&#39; is the name of the filter that GDB will display.
        #
        # &#39;priority&#39; is the priority of the filter relative to other
        # filters.
        #
        # &#39;enabled&#39; is a boolean that indicates whether this filter is
        # enabled and should be executed.

        self.name = &#34;Foo&#34;
        self.priority = 100
        self.enabled = True

        # Register this frame filter with the global frame_filters
        # dictionary.
        gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self

    def filter(self, frame_iter):
        # Just return the iterator.
        return frame_iter
</pre></div>

<p>The frame filter in the example above implements the three
requirements for all frame filters.  It implements the API, self
registers, and makes a decision on the iterator (in this case, it just
returns the iterator untouched).
</p>
<p>The first step is attribute creation and assignment, and as shown in
the comments the filter assigns the following attributes:  <code>name</code>,
<code>priority</code> and whether the filter should be enabled with the
<code>enabled</code> attribute.
</p>
<p>The second step is registering the frame filter with the dictionary or
dictionaries that the frame filter has interest in.  As shown in the
comments, this filter just registers itself with the global dictionary
<code>gdb.frame_filters</code>.  As noted earlier, <code>gdb.frame_filters</code>
is a dictionary that is initialized in the <code>gdb</code> module when
<small>GDB</small> starts.  What dictionary a filter registers with is an
important consideration.  Generally, if a filter is specific to a set
of code, it should be registered either in the <code>objfile</code> or
<code>progspace</code> dictionaries as they are specific to the program
currently loaded in <small>GDB</small>.  The global dictionary is always
present in <small>GDB</small> and is never unloaded.  Any filters registered
with the global dictionary will exist until <small>GDB</small> exits.  To
avoid filters that may conflict, it is generally better to register
frame filters against the dictionaries that more closely align with
the usage of the filter currently in question.  See <a href="#Python-Auto_002dloading">Python Auto-loading</a>, for further information on auto-loading Python scripts.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> takes a hands-off approach to frame filter registration,
therefore it is the frame filter’s responsibility to ensure
registration has occurred, and that any exceptions are handled
appropriately.  In particular, you may wish to handle exceptions
relating to Python dictionary key uniqueness.  It is mandatory that
the dictionary key is the same as frame filter’s <code>name</code>
attribute.  When a user manages frame filters (see <a href="#Frame-Filter-Management">Frame Filter Management</a>), the names <small>GDB</small> will display are those contained
in the <code>name</code> attribute.
</p>
<p>The final step of this example is the implementation of the
<code>filter</code> method.  As shown in the example comments, we define the
<code>filter</code> method and note that the method must take an iterator,
and also must return an iterator.  In this bare-bones example, the
frame filter is not very useful as it just returns the iterator
untouched.  However this is a valid operation for frame filters that
have the <code>enabled</code> attribute set, but decide not to operate on
any frames.
</p>
<p>In the next example, the frame filter operates on all frames and
utilizes a frame decorator to perform some work on the frames.
See <a href="#Frame-Decorator-API">Frame Decorator API</a>, for further information on the frame
decorator interface.
</p>
<p>This example works on inlined frames.  It highlights frames which are
inlined by tagging them with an “[inlined]” tag.  By applying a
frame decorator to all frames with the Python <code>itertools imap</code>
method, the example defers actions to the frame decorator.  Frame
decorators are only processed when <small>GDB</small> prints the backtrace.
</p>
<p>This introduces a new decision making topic: whether to perform
decision making operations at the filtering step, or at the printing
step.  In this example’s approach, it does not perform any filtering
decisions at the filtering step beyond mapping a frame decorator to
each frame.  This allows the actual decision making to be performed
when each frame is printed.  This is an important consideration, and
well worth reflecting upon when designing a frame filter.  An issue
that frame filters should avoid is unwinding the stack if possible.
Some stacks can run very deep, into the tens of thousands in some
cases.  To search every frame to determine if it is inlined ahead of
time may be too expensive at the filtering step.  The frame filter
cannot know how many frames it has to iterate over, and it would have
to iterate through them all.  This ends up duplicating effort as
<small>GDB</small> performs this iteration when it prints the frames.
</p>
<p>In this example decision making can be deferred to the printing step.
As each frame is printed, the frame decorator can examine each frame
in turn when <small>GDB</small> iterates.  From a performance viewpoint,
this is the most appropriate decision to make as it avoids duplicating
the effort that the printing step would undertake anyway.  Also, if
there are many frame filters unwinding the stack during filtering, it
can substantially delay the printing of the backtrace which will
result in large memory usage, and a poor user experience.
</p>
<div>
<pre>class InlineFilter():

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = &#34;InlinedFrameFilter&#34;
        self.priority = 100
        self.enabled = True
        gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self

    def filter(self, frame_iter):
        frame_iter = itertools.imap(InlinedFrameDecorator,
                                    frame_iter)
        return frame_iter
</pre></div>

<p>This frame filter is somewhat similar to the earlier example, except
that the <code>filter</code> method applies a frame decorator object called
<code>InlinedFrameDecorator</code> to each element in the iterator.  The
<code>imap</code> Python method is light-weight.  It does not proactively
iterate over the iterator, but rather creates a new iterator which
wraps the existing one.
</p>
<p>Below is the frame decorator for this example.
</p>
<div>
<pre>class InlinedFrameDecorator(FrameDecorator):

    def __init__(self, fobj):
        super(InlinedFrameDecorator, self).__init__(fobj)

    def function(self):
        frame = self.inferior_frame()
        name = str(frame.name())

        if frame.type() == gdb.INLINE_FRAME:
            name = name + &#34; [inlined]&#34;

        return name
</pre></div>

<p>This frame decorator only defines and overrides the <code>function</code>
method.  It lets the supplied <code>FrameDecorator</code>, which is shipped
with <small>GDB</small>, perform the other work associated with printing
this frame.
</p>
<p>The combination of these two objects create this output from a
backtrace:
</p>
<div>
<pre>#0  0x004004e0 in bar () at inline.c:11
#1  0x00400566 in max [inlined] (b=6, a=12) at inline.c:21
#2  0x00400566 in main () at inline.c:31
</pre></div>

<p>So in the case of this example, a frame decorator is applied to all
frames, regardless of whether they may be inlined or not.  As
<small>GDB</small> iterates over the iterator produced by the frame filters,
<small>GDB</small> executes each frame decorator which then makes a decision
on what to print in the <code>function</code> callback.  Using a strategy
like this is a way to defer decisions on the frame content to printing
time.
</p>
<a name="Eliding-Frames"></a>
<h4>Eliding Frames</h4>

<p>It might be that the above example is not desirable for representing
inlined frames, and a hierarchical approach may be preferred.  If we
want to hierarchically represent frames, the <code>elided</code> frame
decorator interface might be preferable.
</p>
<p>This example approaches the issue with the <code>elided</code> method.  This
example is quite long, but very simplistic.  It is out-of-scope for
this section to write a complete example that comprehensively covers
all approaches of finding and printing inlined frames.  However, this
example illustrates the approach an author might use.
</p>
<p>This example comprises of three sections.
</p>
<div>
<pre>class InlineFrameFilter():

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = &#34;InlinedFrameFilter&#34;
        self.priority = 100
        self.enabled = True
        gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self

    def filter(self, frame_iter):
        return ElidingInlineIterator(frame_iter)
</pre></div>

<p>This frame filter is very similar to the other examples.  The only
difference is this frame filter is wrapping the iterator provided to
it (<code>frame_iter</code>) with a custom iterator called
<code>ElidingInlineIterator</code>.  This again defers actions to when
<small>GDB</small> prints the backtrace, as the iterator is not traversed
until printing.
</p>
<p>The iterator for this example is as follows.  It is in this section of
the example where decisions are made on the content of the backtrace.
</p>
<div>
<pre>class ElidingInlineIterator:
    def __init__(self, ii):
        self.input_iterator = ii

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def next(self):
        frame = next(self.input_iterator)

        if frame.inferior_frame().type() != gdb.INLINE_FRAME:
            return frame

        try:
            eliding_frame = next(self.input_iterator)
        except StopIteration:
            return frame
        return ElidingFrameDecorator(eliding_frame, [frame])
</pre></div>

<p>This iterator implements the Python iterator protocol.  When the
<code>next</code> function is called (when <small>GDB</small> prints each frame),
the iterator checks if this frame decorator, <code>frame</code>, is wrapping
an inlined frame.  If it is not, it returns the existing frame decorator
untouched.  If it is wrapping an inlined frame, it assumes that the
inlined frame was contained within the next oldest frame,
<code>eliding_frame</code>, which it fetches.  It then creates and returns a
frame decorator, <code>ElidingFrameDecorator</code>, which contains both the
elided frame, and the eliding frame.
</p>
<div>
<pre>class ElidingInlineDecorator(FrameDecorator):

    def __init__(self, frame, elided_frames):
        super(ElidingInlineDecorator, self).__init__(frame)
        self.frame = frame
        self.elided_frames = elided_frames

    def elided(self):
        return iter(self.elided_frames)
</pre></div>

<p>This frame decorator overrides one function and returns the inlined
frame in the <code>elided</code> method.  As before it lets
<code>FrameDecorator</code> do the rest of the work involved in printing
this frame.  This produces the following output.
</p>
<div>
<pre>#0  0x004004e0 in bar () at inline.c:11
#2  0x00400529 in main () at inline.c:25
    #1  0x00400529 in max (b=6, a=12) at inline.c:15
</pre></div>

<p>In that output, <code>max</code> which has been inlined into <code>main</code> is
printed hierarchically.  Another approach would be to combine the
<code>function</code> method, and the <code>elided</code> method to both print a
marker in the inlined frame, and also show the hierarchical
relationship.

<a name="Unwinding-Frames-in-Python-1"></a>
<h4>23.3.2.12 Unwinding Frames in Python</h4>
<a name="index-unwinding-frames-in-Python"></a>

<p>In <small>GDB</small> terminology “unwinding” is the process of finding
the previous frame (that is, caller’s) from the current one.  An
unwinder has three methods.  The first one checks if it can handle
given frame (“sniff” it).  For the frames it can sniff an unwinder
provides two additional methods: it can return frame’s ID, and it can
fetch registers from the previous frame.  A running <small>GDB</small>
mantains a list of the unwinders and calls each unwinder’s sniffer in
turn until it finds the one that recognizes the current frame.  There
is an API to register an unwinder.
</p>
<p>The unwinders that come with <small>GDB</small> handle standard frames.
However, mixed language applications (for example, an application
running Java Virtual Machine) sometimes use frame layouts that cannot
be handled by the <small>GDB</small> unwinders.  You can write Python code
that can handle such custom frames.
</p>
<p>You implement a frame unwinder in Python as a class with which has two
attributes, <code>name</code> and <code>enabled</code>, with obvious meanings, and
a single method <code>__call__</code>, which examines a given frame and
returns an object (an instance of <code>gdb.UnwindInfo class)</code>
describing it.  If an unwinder does not recognize a frame, it should
return <code>None</code>.  The code in <small>GDB</small> that enables writing
unwinders in Python uses this object to return frame’s ID and previous
frame registers when <small>GDB</small> core asks for them.
</p>
<p>An unwinder should do as little work as possible.  Some otherwise
innocuous operations can cause problems (even crashes, as this code is
not not well-hardened yet).  For example, making an inferior call from
an unwinder is unadvisable, as an inferior call will reset
<small>GDB</small>’s stack unwinding process, potentially causing re-entrant
unwinding.
</p>
<a name="Unwinder-Input"></a>
<h4>Unwinder Input</h4>

<p>An object passed to an unwinder (a <code>gdb.PendingFrame</code> instance)
provides a method to read frame’s registers:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-PendingFrame_002eread_005fregister"></a>Function: <strong>PendingFrame.read_register</strong> <em>(reg)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This method returns the contents of the register <var>reg</var> in the
frame as a <code>gdb.Value</code> object.  For a description of the
acceptable values of <var>reg</var> see
<a href="#gdbpy_005fframe_005fread_005fregister">Frame.read_register</a>.  If <var>reg</var>
does not name a register for the current architecture, this method
will throw an exception.
</p>
<p>Note that this method will always return a <code>gdb.Value</code> for a
valid register name.  This does not mean that the value will be valid.
For example, you may request a register that an earlier unwinder could
not unwind—the value will be unavailable.  Instead, the
<code>gdb.Value</code> returned from this method will be lazy; that is, its
underlying bits will not be fetched until it is first used.  So,
attempting to use such a value will cause an exception at the point of
use.
</p>
<p>The type of the returned <code>gdb.Value</code> depends on the register and
the architecture.  It is common for registers to have a scalar type,
like <code>long long</code>; but many other types are possible, such as
pointer, pointer-to-function, floating point or vector types.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>It also provides a factory method to create a <code>gdb.UnwindInfo</code>
instance to be returned to <small>GDB</small>:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-PendingFrame_002ecreate_005funwind_005finfo"></a>Function: <strong>PendingFrame.create_unwind_info</strong> <em>(frame_id)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns a new <code>gdb.UnwindInfo</code> instance identified by given
<var>frame_id</var>.  The argument is used to build <small>GDB</small>’s frame ID
using one of functions provided by <small>GDB</small>.  <var>frame_id</var>’s attributes
determine which function will be used, as follows:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>sp, pc</code></dt>
<dd><p>The frame is identified by the given stack address and PC.  The stack
address must be chosen so that it is constant throughout the lifetime
of the frame, so a typical choice is the value of the stack pointer at
the start of the function—in the DWARF standard, this would be the
“Call Frame Address”.
</p>
<p>This is the most common case by far.  The other cases are documented
for completeness but are only useful in specialized situations.
</p>
</dd>

<h4>23.3.2.13 Xmethods In Python</h4>
<a name="index-xmethods-in-Python"></a>

<p><em>Xmethods</em> are additional methods or replacements for existing
methods of a C<tt>++</tt> class.  This feature is useful for those cases
where a method defined in C<tt>++</tt> source code could be inlined or
optimized out by the compiler, making it unavailable to <small>GDB</small>.
For such cases, one can define an xmethod to serve as a replacement
for the method defined in the C<tt>++</tt> source code.  <small>GDB</small> will
then invoke the xmethod, instead of the C<tt>++</tt> method, to
evaluate expressions.  One can also use xmethods when debugging
with core files.  Moreover, when debugging live programs, invoking an
xmethod need not involve running the inferior (which can potentially
perturb its state).  Hence, even if the C<tt>++</tt> method is available, it
is better to use its replacement xmethod if one is defined.
</p>
<p>The xmethods feature in Python is available via the concepts of an
<em>xmethod matcher</em> and an <em>xmethod worker</em>.  To
implement an xmethod, one has to implement a matcher and a
corresponding worker for it (more than one worker can be
implemented, each catering to a different overloaded instance of the
method).  Internally, <small>GDB</small> invokes the <code>match</code> method of a
matcher to match the class type and method name.  On a match, the
<code>match</code> method returns a list of matching <em>worker</em> objects.
Each worker object typically corresponds to an overloaded instance of
the xmethod.  They implement a <code>get_arg_types</code> method which
returns a sequence of types corresponding to the arguments the xmethod
requires.  <small>GDB</small> uses this sequence of types to perform
overload resolution and picks a winning xmethod worker.  A winner
is also selected from among the methods <small>GDB</small> finds in the
C<tt>++</tt> source code.  Next, the winning xmethod worker and the
winning C<tt>++</tt> method are compared to select an overall winner.  In
case of a tie between a xmethod worker and a C<tt>++</tt> method, the
xmethod worker is selected as the winner.  That is, if a winning
xmethod worker is found to be equivalent to the winning C<tt>++</tt>
method, then the xmethod worker is treated as a replacement for
the C<tt>++</tt> method.  <small>GDB</small> uses the overall winner to invoke the
method.  If the winning xmethod worker is the overall winner, then
the corresponding xmethod is invoked via the <code>__call__</code> method
of the worker object.
</p>
<p>If one wants to implement an xmethod as a replacement for an
existing C<tt>++</tt> method, then they have to implement an equivalent
xmethod which has exactly the same name and takes arguments of
exactly the same type as the C<tt>++</tt> method.  If the user wants to
invoke the C<tt>++</tt> method even though a replacement xmethod is
available for that method, then they can disable the xmethod.

<a name="Writing-an-Xmethod-1"></a>
<h4>23.3.2.15 Writing an Xmethod</h4>
<a name="index-writing-xmethods-in-Python"></a>

<p>Implementing xmethods in Python will require implementing xmethod
matchers and xmethod workers (see <a href="#Xmethods-In-Python">Xmethods In Python</a>).  Consider
the following C<tt>++</tt> class:
</p>
<div>
<pre>class MyClass
{
public:
  MyClass (int a) : a_(a) { }

  int geta (void) { return a_; }
  int operator+ (int b);

private:
  int a_;
};

int
MyClass::operator+ (int b)
{
  return a_ + b;
}
</pre></div>

<p>Let us define two xmethods for the class <code>MyClass</code>, one
replacing the method <code>geta</code>, and another adding an overloaded
flavor of <code>operator+</code> which takes a <code>MyClass</code> argument (the
C<tt>++</tt> code above already has an overloaded <code>operator+</code>
which takes an <code>int</code> argument).  The xmethod matcher can be
defined as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre>class MyClass_geta(gdb.xmethod.XMethod):
    def __init__(self):
        gdb.xmethod.XMethod.__init__(self, &#39;geta&#39;)
 
    def get_worker(self, method_name):
        if method_name == &#39;geta&#39;:
            return MyClassWorker_geta()
 
 
class MyClass_sum(gdb.xmethod.XMethod):
    def __init__(self):
        gdb.xmethod.XMethod.__init__(self, &#39;sum&#39;)
 
    def get_worker(self, method_name):
        if method_name == &#39;operator+&#39;:
            return MyClassWorker_plus()
 
 
class MyClassMatcher(gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher):
    def __init__(self):
        gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher.__init__(self, &#39;MyClassMatcher&#39;)
        # List of methods &#39;managed&#39; by this matcher
        self.methods = [MyClass_geta(), MyClass_sum()]
 
    def match(self, class_type, method_name):
        if class_type.tag != &#39;MyClass&#39;:
            return None
        workers = []
        for method in self.methods:
            if method.enabled:
                worker = method.get_worker(method_name)
                if worker:
                    workers.append(worker)
 
        return workers
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that the <code>match</code> method of <code>MyClassMatcher</code> returns
a worker object of type <code>MyClassWorker_geta</code> for the <code>geta</code>
method, and a worker object of type <code>MyClassWorker_plus</code> for the
<code>operator+</code> method.  This is done indirectly via helper classes
derived from <code>gdb.xmethod.XMethod</code>.  One does not need to use the
<code>methods</code> attribute in a matcher as it is optional.  However, if a
matcher manages more than one xmethod, it is a good practice to list the
xmethods in the <code>methods</code> attribute of the matcher.  This will then
facilitate enabling and disabling individual xmethods via the
<code>enable/disable</code> commands.  Notice also that a worker object is
returned only if the corresponding entry in the <code>methods</code> attribute
of the matcher is enabled.
</p>
<p>The implementation of the worker classes returned by the matcher setup
above is as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre>class MyClassWorker_geta(gdb.xmethod.XMethodWorker):
    def get_arg_types(self):
        return None

    def get_result_type(self, obj):
        return gdb.lookup_type(&#39;int&#39;)
 
    def __call__(self, obj):
        return obj[&#39;a_&#39;]
 
 
class MyClassWorker_plus(gdb.xmethod.XMethodWorker):
    def get_arg_types(self):
        return gdb.lookup_type(&#39;MyClass&#39;)

    def get_result_type(self, obj):
        return gdb.lookup_type(&#39;int&#39;)
 
    def __call__(self, obj, other):
        return obj[&#39;a_&#39;] + other[&#39;a_&#39;]
</pre></div>

<p>For <small>GDB</small> to actually lookup a xmethod, it has to be
registered with it.  The matcher defined above is registered with
<small>GDB</small> globally as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre>gdb.xmethod.register_xmethod_matcher(None, MyClassMatcher())
</pre></div>

<p>If an object <code>obj</code> of type <code>MyClass</code> is initialized in C<tt>++</tt>
code as follows:
</p>


<p>then, after loading the Python script defining the xmethod matchers
and workers into <code>GDBN</code>, invoking the method <code>geta</code> or using
the operator <code>+</code> on <code>obj</code> will invoke the xmethods
defined above:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) p obj.geta()
$1 = 5

(gdb) p obj + obj
$2 = 10
</pre></div>

<p>Consider another example with a C++ template class:
</p>
<div>
<pre>template &lt;class T&gt;
class MyTemplate
{
public:
  MyTemplate () : dsize_(10), data_ (new T [10]) { }
  ~MyTemplate () { delete [] data_; }
 
  int footprint (void)
  {
    return sizeof (T) * dsize_ + sizeof (MyTemplate&lt;T&gt;);
  }
 
private:
  int dsize_;
  T *data_;
};
</pre></div>

<p>Let us implement an xmethod for the above class which serves as a
replacement for the <code>footprint</code> method.  The full code listing
of the xmethod workers and xmethod matchers is as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre>class MyTemplateWorker_footprint(gdb.xmethod.XMethodWorker):
    def __init__(self, class_type):
        self.class_type = class_type

    def get_arg_types(self):
        return None

    def get_result_type(self):
        return gdb.lookup_type(&#39;int&#39;)

    def __call__(self, obj):
        return (self.class_type.sizeof +
                obj[&#39;dsize_&#39;] *
                self.class_type.template_argument(0).sizeof)
 
 
class MyTemplateMatcher_footprint(gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher):
    def __init__(self):
        gdb.xmethod.XMethodMatcher.__init__(self, &#39;MyTemplateMatcher&#39;)
 
    def match(self, class_type, method_name):
        if (re.match(&#39;MyTemplate&lt;[ \t\n]*[_a-zA-Z][ _a-zA-Z0-9]*&gt;&#39;,
                     class_type.tag) and
            method_name == &#39;footprint&#39;):
            return MyTemplateWorker_footprint(class_type)
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that, in this example, we have not used the <code>methods</code>
attribute of the matcher as the matcher manages only one xmethod.  The
user can enable/disable this xmethod by enabling/disabling the matcher
itself.

<h4>23.3.2.17 Events In Python</h4>
<a name="index-inferior-events-in-Python"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> provides a general event facility so that Python code can be
notified of various state changes, particularly changes that occur in
the inferior.
</p>
<p>An <em>event</em> is just an object that describes some state change.  The
type of the object and its attributes will vary depending on the details
of the change.  All the existing events are described below.
</p>
<p>In order to be notified of an event, you must register an event handler
with an <em>event registry</em>.  An event registry is an object in the
<code>gdb.events</code> module which dispatches particular events.  A registry
provides methods to register and unregister event handlers:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-EventRegistry_002econnect"></a>Function: <strong>EventRegistry.connect</strong> <em>(object)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Add the given callable <var>object</var> to the registry.  This object will be
called when an event corresponding to this registry occurs.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-EventRegistry_002edisconnect"></a>Function: <strong>EventRegistry.disconnect</strong> <em>(object)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Remove the given <var>object</var> from the registry.  Once removed, the object
will no longer receive notifications of events.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Here is an example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>def exit_handler (event):
    print (&#34;event type: exit&#34;)
    if hasattr (event, &#39;exit_code&#39;):
        print (&#34;exit code: %d&#34; % (event.exit_code))
    else:
        print (&#34;exit code not available&#34;)

gdb.events.exited.connect (exit_handler)
</pre></div>

<p>In the above example we connect our handler <code>exit_handler</code> to the
registry <code>events.exited</code>.  Once connected, <code>exit_handler</code> gets
called when the inferior exits.  The argument <em>event</em> in this example is
of type <code>gdb.ExitedEvent</code>.  As you can see in the example the
<code>ExitedEvent</code> object has an attribute which indicates the exit code of
the inferior.
</p>
<p>The following is a listing of the event registries that are available and
details of the events they emit:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>events.cont</code></dt>
<dd><p>Emits <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code>.
</p>
<p>Some events can be thread specific when <small>GDB</small> is running in non-stop
mode.  When represented in Python, these events all extend
<code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code>.  Note, this event is not emitted directly; instead,
events which are emitted by this or other modules might extend this event.
Examples of these events are <code>gdb.BreakpointEvent</code> and
<code>gdb.ContinueEvent</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-ThreadEvent_002einferior_005fthread"></a>Variable: <strong>ThreadEvent.inferior_thread</strong></dt>
<dd><p>In non-stop mode this attribute will be set to the specific thread which was
involved in the emitted event. Otherwise, it will be set to <code>None</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Emits <code>gdb.ContinueEvent</code> which extends <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code>.
</p>
<p>This event indicates that the inferior has been continued after a stop. For
inherited attribute refer to <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code> above.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>events.exited</code></dt>
<dd><p>Emits <code>events.ExitedEvent</code> which indicates that the inferior has exited.
<code>events.ExitedEvent</code> has two attributes:
</p><dl>
<dt><a name="index-ExitedEvent_002eexit_005fcode"></a>Variable: <strong>ExitedEvent.exit_code</strong></dt>
<dd><p>An integer representing the exit code, if available, which the inferior 
has returned.  (The exit code could be unavailable if, for example,
<small>GDB</small> detaches from the inferior.) If the exit code is unavailable,
the attribute does not exist.
</p></dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-ExitedEvent_002einferior"></a>Variable: <strong>ExitedEvent.inferior</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A reference to the inferior which triggered the <code>exited</code> event.
</p></dd></dl>

</dd>
<dt><code>events.stop</code></dt>
<dd><p>Emits <code>gdb.StopEvent</code> which extends <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code>.
</p>
<p>Indicates that the inferior has stopped.  All events emitted by this registry
extend StopEvent.  As a child of <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code>, <code>gdb.StopEvent</code>
will indicate the stopped thread when <small>GDB</small> is running in non-stop
mode.  Refer to <code>gdb.ThreadEvent</code> above for more details.
</p>
<p>Emits <code>gdb.SignalEvent</code> which extends <code>gdb.StopEvent</code>.
</p>
<p>This event indicates that the inferior or one of its threads has received as
signal.  <code>gdb.SignalEvent</code> has the following attributes:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-SignalEvent_002estop_005fsignal"></a>Variable: <strong>SignalEvent.stop_signal</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A string representing the signal received by the inferior.  A list of possible
signal values can be obtained by running the command <code>info signals</code> in
the <small>GDB</small> command prompt.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Also emits  <code>gdb.BreakpointEvent</code> which extends <code>gdb.StopEvent</code>.
</p>
<p><code>gdb.BreakpointEvent</code> event indicates that one or more breakpoints have
been hit, and has the following attributes:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-BreakpointEvent_002ebreakpoints"></a>Variable: <strong>BreakpointEvent.breakpoints</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A sequence containing references to all the breakpoints (type 
<code>gdb.Breakpoint</code>) that were hit.

</p></dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-BreakpointEvent_002ebreakpoint"></a>Variable: <strong>BreakpointEvent.breakpoint</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A reference to the first breakpoint that was hit.
This function is maintained for backward compatibility and is now deprecated

</dd>
<dt><code>events.new_objfile</code></dt>
<dd><p>Emits <code>gdb.NewObjFileEvent</code> which indicates that a new object file has

</dd>
<dt><code>events.clear_objfiles</code></dt>
<dd><p>Emits <code>gdb.ClearObjFilesEvent</code> which indicates that the list of object
files for a program space has been reset.

</dd>
<dt><code>events.inferior_call</code></dt>
<dd><p>Emits events just before and after a function in the inferior is

</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-InferiorThread_002ename"></a>Variable: <strong>InferiorThread.name</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The name of the thread.  If the user specified a name using
<code>thread name</code>, then this returns that name.  Otherwise, if an

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-InferiorThread_002eptid"></a>Variable: <strong>InferiorThread.ptid</strong></dt>
<dd><p>ID of the thread, as assigned by the operating system.  This attribute is a
tuple containing three integers.  The first is the Process ID (PID); the second
is the Lightweight Process ID (LWPID), and the third is the Thread ID (TID).
Either the LWPID or TID may be 0, which indicates that the operating system
does not  use that identifier.

<p>The following example demonstrates the usage of these objects and
functions to create a function that will rewind a record to the last
time a function in a different file was executed.  This would typically
be used to track the execution of user provided callback functions in a
library which typically are not visible in a back trace.

    rec = gdb.current_recording ()
    if not rec:

        return

    try:
        position = insn.index (rec.replay_position)
    except:
        position = -1
    try:
        filename = insn[position].sal.symtab.fullname ()

        if filename == current:
            continue

        rec.goto (i)
        return
</pre></div>

<p>Another possible application is to write a function that counts the
number of code executions in a given line range.  This line range can
contain parts of functions or span across several functions and is not
limited to be contiguous.
</p>
<div>
<pre>def countrange (filename, linerange):
    count = 0

<h4>23.3.2.20 CLI Commands In Python</h4>

<a name="index-CLI-commands-in-python"></a>
<a name="index-commands-in-python_002c-CLI"></a>
<a name="index-python-commands_002c-CLI"></a>
<p>You can implement new <small>GDB</small> CLI commands in Python.  A CLI
command is implemented using an instance of the <code>gdb.Command</code>
class, most commonly using a subclass.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Command_002e_005f_005finit_005f_005f"></a>Function: <strong>Command.__init__</strong> <em>(name, <var>command_class</var> <span>[</span>, <var>completer_class</var> <span>[</span>, <var>prefix</var><span>]]</span>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>The object initializer for <code>Command</code> registers the new command
with <small>GDB</small>.  This initializer is normally invoked from the
subclass’ own <code>__init__</code> method.
</p>
<p><var>name</var> is the name of the command.  If <var>name</var> consists of
multiple words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix
commands.  In this case, if one of the prefix commands does not exist,
an exception is raised.
</p>
<p>There is no support for multi-line commands.
</p>
<p><var>command_class</var> should be one of the ‘<samp>COMMAND_</samp>’ constants
defined below.  This argument tells <small>GDB</small> how to categorize the
new command in the help system.
</p>
<p><var>completer_class</var> is an optional argument.  If given, it should be
one of the ‘<samp>COMPLETE_</samp>’ constants defined below.  This argument
tells <small>GDB</small> how to perform completion for this command.  If not
given, <small>GDB</small> will attempt to complete using the object’s
<code>complete</code> method (see below); if no such method is found, an
error will occur when completion is attempted.
</p>
<p><var>prefix</var> is an optional argument.  If <code>True</code>, then the new
command is a prefix command; sub-commands of this command may be
registered.
</p>
<p>The help text for the new command is taken from the Python
documentation string for the command’s class, if there is one.  If no
documentation string is provided, the default value “This command is
not documented.” is used.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="index-don_0027t-repeat-Python-command"></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Command_002edont_005frepeat"></a>Function: <strong>Command.dont_repeat</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>By default, a <small>GDB</small> command is repeated when the user enters a
blank line at the command prompt.  A command can suppress this
behavior by invoking the <code>dont_repeat</code> method.  This is similar
to the user command <code>dont-repeat</code>, see <a href="#Define">dont-repeat</a>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Command_002einvoke"></a>Function: <strong>Command.invoke</strong> <em>(argument, from_tty)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This method is called by <small>GDB</small> when this command is invoked.
</p>
<p><var>argument</var> is a string.  It is the argument to the command, after
leading and trailing whitespace has been stripped.
</p>
<p><var>from_tty</var> is a boolean argument.  When true, this means that the
command was entered by the user at the terminal; when false it means
that the command came from elsewhere.
</p>
<p>If this method throws an exception, it is turned into a <small>GDB</small>
<code>error</code> call.  Otherwise, the return value is ignored.
</p>
<a name="index-gdb_002estring_005fto_005fargv"></a>
<p>To break <var>argument</var> up into an argv-like string use
<code>gdb.string_to_argv</code>.  This function behaves identically to
<small>GDB</small>’s internal argument lexer <code>buildargv</code>.
It is recommended to use this for consistency.
Arguments are separated by spaces and may be quoted.
Example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>print gdb.string_to_argv (&#34;1 2\ \\\&#34;3 &#39;4 \&#34;5&#39; \&#34;6 &#39;7\&#34;&#34;)
[&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2 &#34;3&#39;, &#39;4 &#34;5&#39;, &#34;6 &#39;7&#34;]
</pre></div>

<a name="index-completion-of-Python-commands"></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Command_002ecomplete"></a>Function: <strong>Command.complete</strong> <em>(text, word)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This method is called by <small>GDB</small> when the user attempts
completion on this command.  All forms of completion are handled by
this method, that is, the <tt>TAB</tt> and <tt>M-?</tt> key bindings
(see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>), and the <code>complete</code> command (see <a href="#Help">complete</a>).
</p>
<p>The arguments <var>text</var> and <var>word</var> are both strings; <var>text</var>
holds the complete command line up to the cursor’s location, while
<var>word</var> holds the last word of the command line; this is computed
using a word-breaking heuristic.
</p>
<p>The <code>complete</code> method can return several values:
</p><ul>
<li> If the return value is a sequence, the contents of the sequence are
used as the completions.  It is up to <code>complete</code> to ensure that the
contents actually do complete the word.  A zero-length sequence is
allowed, it means that there were no completions available.  Only
string elements of the sequence are used; other elements in the
sequence are ignored.

</li><li> If the return value is one of the ‘<samp>COMPLETE_</samp>’ constants defined
below, then the corresponding <small>GDB</small>-internal completion
function is invoked, and its result is used.

</li><li> All other results are treated as though there were no available
completions.
</li></ul>
</dd></dl>

<p>When a new command is registered, it must be declared as a member of
some general class of commands.  This is used to classify top-level
commands in the on-line help system; note that prefix commands are not
listed under their own category but rather that of their top-level
command.  The available classifications are represented by constants
defined in the <code>gdb</code> module:

<p>A new command can use a predefined completion function, either by

<p>The following code snippet shows how a trivial CLI command can be
implemented in Python:
</p>
<div>
<pre>class HelloWorld (gdb.Command):
  &#34;&#34;&#34;Greet the whole world.&#34;&#34;&#34;

  def __init__ (self):
    super (HelloWorld, self).__init__ (&#34;hello-world&#34;, gdb.COMMAND_USER)

  def invoke (self, arg, from_tty):
    print (&#34;Hello, World!&#34;)

HelloWorld ()
</pre></div>

<p>The last line instantiates the class, and is necessary to trigger the
registration of the command with <small>GDB</small>.  Depending on how the
Python code is read into <small>GDB</small>, you may need to import the
<code>gdb</code> module explicitly.

<small>GDB/MI</small> <code>^error</code> response.  Only <code>gdb.GdbError</code>
exceptions (or its sub-classes) should be used for reporting errors to
users, any other exception type is treated as a failure of the
<code>invoke</code> method, and the exception will be printed to the error
stream according to the <kbd>set python print-stack</kbd> setting
(see <a href="#set_005fpython_005fprint_005fstack"><kbd>set python print-stack</kbd></a>).
</p>
<p>If this method returns <code>None</code>, then the <small>GDB/MI</small> command will
return a <code>^done</code> response with no additional values.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, the return value must be a dictionary, which is converted
to a <small>GDB/MI</small> <var>result-record</var> (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Output-Syntax">GDB/MI Output Syntax</a>).
The keys of this dictionary must be strings, and are used as
<var>variable</var> names in the <var>result-record</var>, these strings must
comply with the naming rules detailed below.  The values of this
dictionary are recursively handled as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If the value is Python sequence or iterator, it is converted to
<small>GDB/MI</small> <var>list</var> with elements converted recursively.

</li><li> If the value is Python dictionary, it is converted to
<small>GDB/MI</small> <var>tuple</var>.  Keys in that dictionary must be strings,
which comply with the <var>variable</var> naming rules detailed below.
Values are converted recursively.

</li><li> Otherwise, value is first converted to a Python string using
<code>str ()</code> and then converted to <small>GDB/MI</small> <var>const</var>.
</li></ul>

<p>The strings used for <var>variable</var> names in the <small>GDB/MI</small> output
must follow the following rules; the string must be at least one
character long, the first character must be in the set
<code>[a-zA-Z]</code>, while every subsequent character must be in the set
<code>[-_a-zA-Z0-9]</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>An instance of <code>MICommand</code> has the following attributes:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-MICommand_002ename"></a>Variable: <strong>MICommand.name</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A string, the name of this <small>GDB/MI</small> command, as was passed to the
<code>__init__</code> method.  This attribute is read-only.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-MICommand_002einstalled"></a>Variable: <strong>MICommand.installed</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A boolean value indicating if this command is installed ready for a
user to call from the command line.  Commands are automatically
installed when they are instantiated, after which this attribute will
be <code>True</code>.
</p>
<p>If later, a new command is created with the same name, then the
original command will become uninstalled, and this attribute will be
<code>False</code>.
</p>
<p>This attribute is read-write, setting this attribute to <code>False</code>
will uninstall the command, removing it from the set of available
commands.  Setting this attribute to <code>True</code> will install the
command for use.  If there is already a Python command with this name
installed, the currently installed command will be uninstalled, and
this command installed in its place.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The following code snippet shows how a two trivial MI command can be
implemented in Python:
</p>
<div>
<pre>class MIEcho(gdb.MICommand):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Echo arguments passed to the command.&#34;&#34;&#34;

    def __init__(self, name, mode):
        self._mode = mode
        super(MIEcho, self).__init__(name)

    def invoke(self, argv):
        if self._mode == &#39;dict&#39;:
            return { &#39;dict&#39;: { &#39;argv&#39; : argv } }
        elif self._mode == &#39;list&#39;:
            return { &#39;list&#39;: argv }
        else:
            return { &#39;string&#39;: &#34;, &#34;.join(argv) }


MIEcho(&#34;-echo-dict&#34;, &#34;dict&#34;)
MIEcho(&#34;-echo-list&#34;, &#34;list&#34;)
MIEcho(&#34;-echo-string&#34;, &#34;string&#34;)
</pre></div>

<p>The last three lines instantiate the class three times, creating three
new <small>GDB/MI</small> commands <code>-echo-dict</code>, <code>-echo-list</code>, and
<code>-echo-string</code>.  Each time a subclass of <code>gdb.MICommand</code> is
instantiated, the new command is automatically registered with
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>Depending on how the Python code is read into <small>GDB</small>, you may
need to import the <code>gdb</code> module explicitly.
</p>
<p>The following example shows a <small>GDB</small> session in which the above
commands have been added:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb)
-echo-dict abc def ghi
^done,dict={argv=[&#34;abc&#34;,&#34;def&#34;,&#34;ghi&#34;]}
(gdb)
-echo-list abc def ghi
^done,list=[&#34;abc&#34;,&#34;def&#34;,&#34;ghi&#34;]
(gdb)
-echo-string abc def ghi
^done,string=&#34;abc, def, ghi&#34;
(gdb)
</pre></div>

<h4>23.3.2.22 Parameters In Python</h4>

<a name="index-parameters-in-python"></a>
<a name="index-python-parameters"></a>
<a name="index-gdb_002eParameter"></a>
<a name="index-Parameter"></a>
<p>You can implement new <small>GDB</small> parameters using Python.  A new
parameter is implemented as an instance of the <code>gdb.Parameter</code>
class.
</p>
<p>Parameters are exposed to the user via the <code>set</code> and
<code>show</code> commands.  See <a href="#Help">Help</a>.
</p>
<p>There are many parameters that already exist and can be set in
<small>GDB</small>.  Two examples are: <code>set follow fork</code> and
<code>set charset</code>.  Setting these parameters influences certain
behavior in <small>GDB</small>.  Similarly, you can define parameters that
can be used to influence behavior in custom Python scripts and commands.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Parameter_002e_005f_005finit_005f_005f"></a>Function: <strong>Parameter.__init__</strong> <em>(name, <var>command-class</var>, <var>parameter-class</var> <span>[</span>, <var>enum-sequence</var><span>]</span>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>The object initializer for <code>Parameter</code> registers the new
parameter with <small>GDB</small>.  This initializer is normally invoked
from the subclass’ own <code>__init__</code> method.
</p>
<p><var>name</var> is the name of the new parameter.  If <var>name</var> consists
of multiple words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix
parameters.  An example of this can be illustrated with the
<code>set print</code> set of parameters.  If <var>name</var> is
<code>print foo</code>, then <code>print</code> will be searched as the prefix
parameter.  In this case the parameter can subsequently be accessed in
<small>GDB</small> as <code>set print foo</code>.
</p>
<p>If <var>name</var> consists of multiple words, and no prefix parameter group
can be found, an exception is raised.
</p>
<p><var>command-class</var> should be one of the ‘<samp>COMMAND_</samp>’ constants
(see <a href="#CLI-Commands-In-Python">CLI Commands In Python</a>).  This argument tells <small>GDB</small> how to
categorize the new parameter in the help system.
</p>
<p><var>parameter-class</var> should be one of the ‘<samp>PARAM_</samp>’ constants
defined below.  This argument tells <small>GDB</small> the type of the new
parameter; this information is used for input validation and
completion.
</p>
<p>If <var>parameter-class</var> is <code>PARAM_ENUM</code>, then
<var>enum-sequence</var> must be a sequence of strings.  These strings
represent the possible values for the parameter.
</p>
<p>If <var>parameter-class</var> is not <code>PARAM_ENUM</code>, then the presence
of a fourth argument will cause an exception to be thrown.
</p>
<p>The help text for the new parameter includes the Python documentation
string from the parameter’s class, if there is one.  If there is no
documentation string, a default value is used.  The documentation
string is included in the output of the parameters <code>help set</code> and
<code>help show</code> commands, and should be written taking this into
account.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Parameter_002eset_005fdoc"></a>Variable: <strong>Parameter.set_doc</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If this attribute exists, and is a string, then its value is used as
the first part of the help text for this parameter’s <code>set</code>
command.  The second part of the help text is taken from the
documentation string for the parameter’s class, if there is one.
</p>
<p>The value of <code>set_doc</code> should give a brief summary specific to
the set action, this text is only displayed when the user runs the
<code>help set</code> command for this parameter.  The class documentation
should be used to give a fuller description of what the parameter
does, this text is displayed for both the <code>help set</code> and
<code>help show</code> commands.
</p>
<p>The <code>set_doc</code> value is examined when <code>Parameter.__init__</code> is
invoked; subsequent changes have no effect.

</p>
<p>The value of <code>show_doc</code> should give a brief summary specific to
the show action, this text is only displayed when the user runs the
<code>help show</code> command for this parameter.  The class documentation
should be used to give a fuller description of what the parameter
does, this text is displayed for both the <code>help set</code> and

<dd><p>The <code>value</code> attribute holds the underlying value of the
parameter.  It can be read and assigned to just as any other
attribute.  <small>GDB</small> does validation when assignments are made.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>There are two methods that may be implemented in any <code>Parameter</code>
class.  These are:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Parameter_002eget_005fset_005fstring"></a>Function: <strong>Parameter.get_set_string</strong> <em>(self)</em></dt>
<dd><p>If this method exists, <small>GDB</small> will call it when a
<var>parameter</var>’s value has been changed via the <code>set</code> API (for
example, <kbd>set foo off</kbd>).  The <code>value</code> attribute has already
been populated with the new value and may be used in output.  This
method must return a string.  If the returned string is not empty,
<small>GDB</small> will present it to the user.
</p>
<p>If this method raises the <code>gdb.GdbError</code> exception
(see <a href="#Exception-Handling">Exception Handling</a>), then <small>GDB</small> will print the
exception’s string and the <code>set</code> command will fail.  Note,
however, that the <code>value</code> attribute will not be reset in this
case.  So, if your parameter must validate values, it should store the
old value internally and reset the exposed value, like so:
</p>
<div>
<pre>class ExampleParam (gdb.Parameter):
   def __init__ (self, name):
      super (ExampleParam, self).__init__ (name,

      self.value = True
      self.saved_value = True
   def validate(self):
      return False
   def get_set_string (self):
      if not self.validate():
        self.value = self.saved_value
        raise gdb.GdbError(&#39;Failed to validate&#39;)
      self.saved_value = self.value
      return &#34;&#34;

<dd><p><small>GDB</small> will call this method when a <var>parameter</var>’s
<code>show</code> API has been invoked (for example, <kbd>show foo</kbd>).  The
argument <code>svalue</code> receives the string representation of the
current value.  This method must return a string.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>When a new parameter is defined, its type must be specified.  The

<p><small>GDB</small> loads symbols for an inferior from various
symbol-containing files (see <a href="#Files">Files</a>).  These include the primary
executable file, any shared libraries used by the inferior, and any
separate debug info files (see <a href="#Separate-Debug-Files">Separate Debug Files</a>).
<small>GDB</small> calls these symbol-containing files <em>objfiles</em>.
</p>
<p>The following objfile-related functions are available in the

<dd><p>When auto-loading a Python script (see <a href="#Python-Auto_002dloading">Python Auto-loading</a>), <small>GDB</small>
sets the “current objfile” to the corresponding objfile.  This

<h4>23.3.2.26 Accessing inferior stack frames from Python</h4>

<a name="index-frames-in-python"></a>
<p>When the debugged program stops, <small>GDB</small> is able to analyze its call
stack (see <a href="#Frames">Stack frames</a>).  The <code>gdb.Frame</code> class
represents a frame in the stack.  A <code>gdb.Frame</code> object is only valid
while its corresponding frame exists in the inferior’s stack.  If you try
to use an invalid frame object, <small>GDB</small> will throw a <code>gdb.error</code>
exception (see <a href="#Exception-Handling">Exception Handling</a>).
</p>
<p>Two <code>gdb.Frame</code> objects can be compared for equality with the <code>==</code>
operator, like:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) python print gdb.newest_frame() == gdb.selected_frame ()
True
</pre></div>

<p>The following frame-related functions are available in the <code>gdb</code> module:

<dd><p><small>GDB</small> internally keeps a cache of the frames that have been
unwound.  This function invalidates this cache.
</p>
<p>This function should not generally be called by ordinary Python code.
It is documented for the sake of completeness.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>A <code>gdb.Frame</code> object has the following methods:
</p>
<dl>

<dd><p>Returns true if the <code>gdb.Frame</code> object is valid, false if not.
A frame object can become invalid if the frame it refers to doesn’t
exist anymore in the inferior.  All <code>gdb.Frame</code> methods will throw
an exception if it is invalid at the time the method is called.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Frame_002ename"></a>Function: <strong>Frame.name</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns the function name of the frame, or <code>None</code> if it can’t be
obtained.

<h4>23.3.2.27 Accessing blocks from Python</h4>

<a name="index-blocks-in-python"></a>
<a name="index-gdb_002eBlock"></a>

<p>In <small>GDB</small>, symbols are stored in blocks.  A block corresponds
roughly to a scope in the source code.  Blocks are organized
hierarchically, and are represented individually in Python as a
<code>gdb.Block</code>.  Blocks rely on debugging information being
available.
</p>
<p>A frame has a block.  Please see <a href="#Frames-In-Python">Frames In Python</a>, for a more
in-depth discussion of frames.
</p>
<p>The outermost block is known as the <em>global block</em>.  The global
block typically holds public global variables and functions.
</p>
<p>The block nested just inside the global block is the <em>static
block</em>.  The static block typically holds file-scoped variables and
functions.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> provides a method to get a block’s superblock, but there
is currently no way to examine the sub-blocks of a block, or to
iterate over all the blocks in a symbol table (see <a href="#Symbol-Tables-In-Python">Symbol Tables In Python</a>).
</p>
<p>Here is a short example that should help explain blocks:
</p>

<p>A <code>gdb.Block</code> is iterable.  The iterator returns the symbols
(see <a href="#Symbols-In-Python">Symbols In Python</a>) local to the block.  Python programs
should not assume that a specific block object will always contain a
given symbol, since changes in <small>GDB</small> features and
infrastructure may cause symbols move across blocks in a symbol
table.  You can also use Python’s <em>dictionary syntax</em> to access
variables in this block, e.g.:
</p>
<div>
<pre>symbol = some_block[&#39;variable&#39;]  # symbol is of type gdb.Symbol
</pre></div>

<p>The following block-related functions are available in the <code>gdb</code>
module:
</p>
<a name="index-gdb_002eblock_005ffor_005fpc"></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_002eblock_005ffor_005fpc-1"></a>Function: <strong>gdb.block_for_pc</strong> <em>(pc)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the innermost <code>gdb.Block</code> containing the given <var>pc</var>
value.  If the block cannot be found for the <var>pc</var> value specified,
the function will return <code>None</code>.  This is identical to
<code>gdb.current_progspace().block_for_pc(pc)</code> and is included for
historical compatibility.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>A <code>gdb.Block</code> object has the following methods:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Block_002eis_005fvalid"></a>Function: <strong>Block.is_valid</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns <code>True</code> if the <code>gdb.Block</code> object is valid,
<code>False</code> if not.  A block object can become invalid if the block it
refers to doesn’t exist anymore in the inferior.  All other
<code>gdb.Block</code> methods will throw an exception if it is invalid at
the time the method is called.  The block’s validity is also checked
during iteration over symbols of the block.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>A <code>gdb.Block</code> object has the following attributes:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Block_002estart"></a>Variable: <strong>Block.start</strong></dt>

<dd><p>The name of the block represented as a <code>gdb.Symbol</code>.  If the
block is not named, then this attribute holds <code>None</code>.  This

</p>
<p>For ordinary function blocks, the superblock is the static block.
However, you should note that it is possible for a function block to
have a superblock that is not the static block – for instance this
happens for an inlined function.

<h4>23.3.2.28 Python representation of Symbols</h4>

<a name="index-symbols-in-python"></a>
<a name="index-gdb_002eSymbol"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> represents every variable, function and type as an
entry in a symbol table.  See <a href="#Symbols">Examining the Symbol Table</a>.
Similarly, Python represents these symbols in <small>GDB</small> with the
<code>gdb.Symbol</code> object.
</p>
<p>The following symbol-related functions are available in the <code>gdb</code>
module:
</p>
<a name="index-gdb_002elookup_005fsymbol"></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_002elookup_005fsymbol-1"></a>Function: <strong>gdb.lookup_symbol</strong> <em>(name <span>[</span>, block <span>[</span>, domain<span>]]</span>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function searches for a symbol by name.  The search scope can be
restricted to the parameters defined in the optional domain and block
arguments.
</p>
<p><var>name</var> is the name of the symbol.  It must be a string.  The
optional <var>block</var> argument restricts the search to symbols visible
in that <var>block</var>.  The <var>block</var> argument must be a
<code>gdb.Block</code> object.  If omitted, the block for the current frame
is used.  The optional <var>domain</var> argument restricts
the search to the domain type.  The <var>domain</var> argument must be a
domain constant defined in the <code>gdb</code> module and described later
in this chapter.
</p>
<p>The result is a tuple of two elements.
The first element is a <code>gdb.Symbol</code> object or <code>None</code> if the symbol
is not found.
If the symbol is found, the second element is <code>True</code> if the symbol
is a field of a method’s object (e.g., <code>this</code> in C<tt>++</tt>),
otherwise it is <code>False</code>.
If the symbol is not found, the second element is <code>False</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="index-gdb_002elookup_005fglobal_005fsymbol"></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_002elookup_005fglobal_005fsymbol-1"></a>Function: <strong>gdb.lookup_global_symbol</strong> <em>(name <span>[</span>, domain<span>]</span>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function searches for a global symbol by name.
The search scope can be restricted to by the domain argument.
</p>
<p><var>name</var> is the name of the symbol.  It must be a string.
The optional <var>domain</var> argument restricts the search to the domain type.
The <var>domain</var> argument must be a domain constant defined in the <code>gdb</code>
module and described later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>The result is a <code>gdb.Symbol</code> object or <code>None</code> if the symbol
is not found.
</p></dd></dl>

<a name="index-gdb_002elookup_005fstatic_005fsymbol"></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-gdb_002elookup_005fstatic_005fsymbol-1"></a>Function: <strong>gdb.lookup_static_symbol</strong> <em>(name <span>[</span>, domain<span>]</span>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function searches for a global symbol with static linkage by name.
The search scope can be restricted to by the domain argument.
</p>
<p><var>name</var> is the name of the symbol.  It must be a string.
The optional <var>domain</var> argument restricts the search to the domain type.
The <var>domain</var> argument must be a domain constant defined in the <code>gdb</code>
module and described later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>The result is a <code>gdb.Symbol</code> object or <code>None</code> if the symbol
is not found.
</p>
<p>Note that this function will not find function-scoped static variables. To look
up such variables, iterate over the variables of the function’s
<code>gdb.Block</code> and check that <code>block.addr_class</code> is
<code>gdb.SYMBOL_LOC_STATIC</code>.
</p>
<p>There can be multiple global symbols with static linkage with the same
name.  This function will only return the first matching symbol that
it finds.  Which symbol is found depends on where <small>GDB</small> is
currently stopped, as <small>GDB</small> will first search for matching
symbols in the current object file, and then search all other object
files.  If the application is not yet running then <small>GDB</small> will
search all object files in the order they appear in the debug
information.

<dd><p>Similar to <code>gdb.lookup_static_symbol</code>, this function searches for
global symbols with static linkage by name, and optionally restricted
by the domain argument.  However, this function returns a list of all
matching symbols found, not just the first one.
</p>
<p><var>name</var> is the name of the symbol.  It must be a string.
The optional <var>domain</var> argument restricts the search to the domain type.
The <var>domain</var> argument must be a domain constant defined in the <code>gdb</code>
module and described later in this chapter.
</p>
<p>The result is a list of <code>gdb.Symbol</code> objects which could be empty
if no matching symbols were found.
</p>
<p>Note that this function will not find function-scoped static variables. To look
up such variables, iterate over the variables of the function’s

<h4>23.3.2.30 Manipulating line tables using Python</h4>

<a name="index-line-tables-in-python"></a>
<a name="index-gdb_002eLineTable"></a>

<p>Python code can request and inspect line table information from a
symbol table that is loaded in <small>GDB</small>.  A line table is a
mapping of source lines to their executable locations in memory.  To
acquire the line table information for a particular symbol table, use
the <code>linetable</code> function (see <a href="#Symbol-Tables-In-Python">Symbol Tables In Python</a>).
</p>
<p>A <code>gdb.LineTable</code> is iterable.  The iterator returns
<code>LineTableEntry</code> objects that correspond to the source line and
address for each line table entry.  <code>LineTableEntry</code> objects have
the following attributes:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-LineTableEntry_002eline"></a>Variable: <strong>LineTableEntry.line</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The source line number for this line table entry.  This number
corresponds to the actual line of source.  This attribute is not
writable.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-LineTableEntry_002epc"></a>Variable: <strong>LineTableEntry.pc</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The address that is associated with the line table entry where the
executable code for that source line resides in memory.  This
attribute is not writable.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>As there can be multiple addresses for a single source line, you may
receive multiple <code>LineTableEntry</code> objects with matching
<code>line</code> attributes, but with different <code>pc</code> attributes.  The
iterator is sorted in ascending <code>pc</code> order.  Here is a small
example illustrating iterating over a line table.
</p>
<div>
<pre>symtab = gdb.selected_frame().find_sal().symtab
linetable = symtab.linetable()
for line in linetable:
   print (&#34;Line: &#34;+str(line.line)+&#34; Address: &#34;+hex(line.pc))
</pre></div>

<p>This will have the following output:
</p>
<div>
<pre>Line: 33 Address: 0x4005c8L
Line: 37 Address: 0x4005caL
Line: 39 Address: 0x4005d2L
Line: 40 Address: 0x4005f8L
Line: 42 Address: 0x4005ffL
Line: 44 Address: 0x400608L
Line: 42 Address: 0x40060cL
Line: 45 Address: 0x400615L
</pre></div>

<p>In addition to being able to iterate over a <code>LineTable</code>, it also
has the following direct access methods:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-LineTable_002eline"></a>Function: <strong>LineTable.line</strong> <em>(line)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a Python <code>Tuple</code> of <code>LineTableEntry</code> objects for any
entries in the line table for the given <var>line</var>, which specifies
the source code line.  If there are no entries for that source code
<var>line</var>, the Python <code>None</code> is returned.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-LineTable_002ehas_005fline"></a>Function: <strong>LineTable.has_line</strong> <em>(line)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a Python <code>Boolean</code> indicating whether there is an entry in
the line table for this source line.  Return <code>True</code> if an entry
is found, or <code>False</code> if not.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-LineTable_002esource_005flines"></a>Function: <strong>LineTable.source_lines</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a Python <code>List</code> of the source line numbers in the symbol
table.  Only lines with executable code locations are returned.  The
contents of the <code>List</code> will just be the source line entries
represented as Python <code>Long</code> values.

<h4>23.3.2.31 Manipulating breakpoints using Python</h4>

<a name="index-breakpoints-in-python"></a>
<a name="index-gdb_002eBreakpoint"></a>

<p>Python code can manipulate breakpoints via the <code>gdb.Breakpoint</code>
class.
</p>
<p>A breakpoint can be created using one of the two forms of the
<code>gdb.Breakpoint</code> constructor.  The first one accepts a string
like one would pass to the <code>break</code>
(see <a href="#Set-Breaks">Setting Breakpoints</a>) and <code>watch</code>
(see <a href="#Set-Watchpoints">Setting Watchpoints</a>) commands, and can be used to
create both breakpoints and watchpoints.  The second accepts separate Python
arguments similar to <a href="#Explicit-Locations">Explicit Locations</a>, and can only be used to create
breakpoints.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-Breakpoint_002e_005f_005finit_005f_005f"></a>Function: <strong>Breakpoint.__init__</strong> <em>(spec <span>[</span>, type <span>][</span>, wp_class <span>][</span>, internal <span>][</span>, temporary <span>][</span>, qualified <span>]</span>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Create a new breakpoint according to <var>spec</var>, which is a string naming the
location of a breakpoint, or an expression that defines a watchpoint.  The
string should describe a location in a format recognized by the <code>break</code>
command (see <a href="#Set-Breaks">Setting Breakpoints</a>) or, in the case of a
watchpoint, by the <code>watch</code> command
(see <a href="#Set-Watchpoints">Setting Watchpoints</a>).
</p>
<p>The optional <var>type</var> argument specifies the type of the breakpoint to create,
as defined below.
</p>
<p>The optional <var>wp_class</var> argument defines the class of watchpoint to create,
if <var>type</var> is <code>gdb.BP_WATCHPOINT</code>.  If <var>wp_class</var> is omitted, it
defaults to <code>gdb.WP_WRITE</code>.
</p>
<p>The optional <var>internal</var> argument allows the breakpoint to become invisible
to the user.  The breakpoint will neither be reported when created, nor will it
be listed in the output from <code>info breakpoints</code> (but will be listed with
the <code>maint info breakpoints</code> command).
</p>
<p>The optional <var>temporary</var> argument makes the breakpoint a temporary
breakpoint.  Temporary breakpoints are deleted after they have been hit.  Any
further access to the Python breakpoint after it has been hit will result in a
runtime error (as that breakpoint has now been automatically deleted).
</p>
<p>The optional <var>qualified</var> argument is a boolean that allows interpreting
the function passed in <code>spec</code> as a fully-qualified name.  It is equivalent
to <code>break</code>’s <code>-qualified</code> flag (see <a href="#Linespec-Locations">Linespec Locations</a> and
<a href="#Explicit-Locations">Explicit Locations</a>).

<dd><p>This second form of creating a new breakpoint specifies the explicit
location (see <a href="#Explicit-Locations">Explicit Locations</a>) using keywords.  The new breakpoint will
be created in the specified source file <var>source</var>, at the specified
<var>function</var>, <var>label</var> and <var>line</var>.

<dd><p>The <code>gdb.Breakpoint</code> class can be sub-classed and, in
particular, you may choose to implement the <code>stop</code> method.
If this method is defined in a sub-class of <code>gdb.Breakpoint</code>,
it will be called when the inferior reaches any location of a
breakpoint which instantiates that sub-class.  If the method returns
<code>True</code>, the inferior will be stopped at the location of the
breakpoint, otherwise the inferior will continue.
</p>
<p>If there are multiple breakpoints at the same location with a
<code>stop</code> method, each one will be called regardless of the
return status of the previous.  This ensures that all <code>stop</code>
methods have a chance to execute at that location.  In this scenario
if one of the methods returns <code>True</code> but the others return
<code>False</code>, the inferior will still be stopped.
</p>
<p>You should not alter the execution state of the inferior (i.e., step,

<h4>23.3.2.35 Registers In Python</h4>

<p>Python code can request from a <code>gdb.Architecture</code> information
about the set of registers available
(see <a href="#gdbpy_005farchitecture_005fregisters"><code>Architecture.registers</code></a>).
The register information is returned as a
<code>gdb.RegisterDescriptorIterator</code>, which is an iterator that in
turn returns <code>gdb.RegisterDescriptor</code> objects.
</p>
<p>A <code>gdb.RegisterDescriptor</code> does not provide the value of a
register (see <a href="#gdbpy_005fframe_005fread_005fregister"><code>Frame.read_register</code></a>
for reading a register’s value), instead the <code>RegisterDescriptor</code>
is a way to discover which registers are available for a particular
architecture.
</p>
<p>A <code>gdb.RegisterDescriptor</code> has the following read-only properties:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-RegisterDescriptor_002ename"></a>Variable: <strong>RegisterDescriptor.name</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The name of this register.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>It is also possible to lookup a register descriptor based on its name
using the following <code>gdb.RegisterDescriptorIterator</code> function:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-RegisterDescriptorIterator_002efind"></a>Function: <strong>RegisterDescriptorIterator.find</strong> <em>(<var>name</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>Takes <var>name</var> as an argument, which must be a string, and returns a
<code>gdb.RegisterDescriptor</code> for the register with that name, or
<code>None</code> if there is no register with that name.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Python code can also request from a <code>gdb.Architecture</code>
information about the set of register groups available on a given
architecture
(see <a href="#gdbpy_005farchitecture_005freggroups"><code>Architecture.register_groups</code></a>).
</p>
<p>Every register can be a member of zero or more register groups.  Some
register groups are used internally within <small>GDB</small> to control
things like which registers must be saved when calling into the
program being debugged (see <a href="#Calling">Calling Program Functions</a>).
Other register groups exist to allow users to easily see related sets
of registers in commands like <code>info registers</code>
(see <a href="#info_005fregisters_005freggroup"><code>info registers

</p>
<p>The register groups information is returned as a

<a name="Connections-In-Python"></a>

<a name="Connections-In-Python-1"></a>
<h4>23.3.2.36 Connections In Python</h4>
<a name="index-connections-in-python"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> lets you run and debug multiple programs in a single
session.  Each program being debugged has a connection, the connection
describes how <small>GDB</small> controls the program being debugged.
Examples of different connection types are ‘<samp>native</samp>’ and
‘<samp>remote</samp>’.  See <a href="#Inferiors-Connections-and-Programs">Inferiors Connections and Programs</a>.
</p>
<p>Connections in <small>GDB</small> are represented as instances of
<code>gdb.TargetConnection</code>, or as one of its sub-classes.  To get a
list of all connections use <code>gdb.connections</code>
(see <a href="#gdbpy_005fconnections">gdb.connections</a>).
</p>
<p>To get the connection for a single <code>gdb.Inferior</code> read its
<code>gdb.Inferior.connection</code> attribute
(see <a href="#gdbpy_005finferior_005fconnection">gdb.Inferior.connection</a>).
</p>
<p>Currently there is only a single sub-class of
<code>gdb.TargetConnection</code>, <code>gdb.RemoteTargetConnection</code>,
however, additional sub-classes may be added in future releases of
<small>GDB</small>.  As a result you should avoid writing code like:
</p>
<div>
<pre>conn = gdb.selected_inferior().connection
if type(conn) is gdb.RemoteTargetConnection:
  print(&#34;This is a remote target connection&#34;)
</pre></div>

<p>as this may fail when more connection types are added.  Instead, you
should write:
</p>
<div>
<pre>conn = gdb.selected_inferior().connection
if isinstance(conn, gdb.RemoteTargetConnection):
  print(&#34;This is a remote target connection&#34;)
</pre></div>

<p>A <code>gdb.TargetConnection</code> has the following method:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-TargetConnection_002eis_005fvalid"></a>Function: <strong>TargetConnection.is_valid</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return <code>True</code> if the <code>gdb.TargetConnection</code> object is valid,
<code>False</code> if not.  A <code>gdb.TargetConnection</code> will become
invalid if the connection no longer exists within <small>GDB</small>, this
might happen when no inferiors are using the connection, but could be
delayed until the user replaces the current target.
</p>
<p>Reading any of the <code>gdb.TargetConnection</code> properties will throw
an exception if the connection is invalid.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>A <code>gdb.TargetConnection</code> has the following read-only properties:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-TargetConnection_002enum"></a>Variable: <strong>TargetConnection.num</strong></dt>
<dd><p>An integer assigned by <small>GDB</small> to uniquely identify this
connection.  This is the same value as displayed in the ‘<samp>Num</samp>’
column of the <code>info connections</code> command output (see <a href="#Inferiors-Connections-and-Programs">info connections</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-TargetConnection_002etype"></a>Variable: <strong>TargetConnection.type</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A string that describes what type of connection this is.  This string
will be one of the valid names that can be passed to the <code>target</code>
command (see <a href="#Target-Commands">target command</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-TargetConnection_002edescription"></a>Variable: <strong>TargetConnection.description</strong></dt>
<dd><p>A string that gives a short description of this target type.  This is
the same string that is displayed in the ‘<samp>Description</samp>’ column of
the <code>info connection</code> command output (see <a href="#Inferiors-Connections-and-Programs">info connections</a>).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-TargetConnection_002edetails"></a>Variable: <strong>TargetConnection.details</strong></dt>
<dd><p>An optional string that gives additional information about this
connection.  This attribute can be <code>None</code> if there are no
additional details for this connection.
</p>
<p>An example of a connection type that might have additional details is
the ‘<samp>remote</samp>’ connection, in this case the details string can
contain the ‘<samp><var>hostname</var>:<var>port</var></samp>’ that was used to connect
to the remote target.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The <code>gdb.RemoteTargetConnection</code> class is a sub-class of
<code>gdb.TargetConnection</code>, and is used to represent ‘<samp>remote</samp>’
and ‘<samp>extended-remote</samp>’ connections.  In addition to the attributes
and methods available from the <code>gdb.TargetConnection</code> base class,
a <code>gdb.RemoteTargetConnection</code> has the following method:
</p>
<a name="index-maint-packet"></a>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-RemoteTargetConnection_002esend_005fpacket"></a>Function: <strong>RemoteTargetConnection.send_packet</strong> <em>(<var>packet</var>)</em></dt>
<dd><p>This method sends <var>packet</var> to the remote target and returns the
response.  The <var>packet</var> should either be a <code>bytes</code> object, or
a <code>Unicode</code> string.
</p>
<p>If <var>packet</var> is a <code>Unicode</code> string, then the string is encoded
to a <code>bytes</code> object using the <small>ASCII</small> codec.  If the string
can’t be encoded then an <code>UnicodeError</code> is raised.
</p>
<p>If <var>packet</var> is not a <code>bytes</code> object, or a <code>Unicode</code>
string, then a <code>TypeError</code> is raised.  If <var>packet</var> is empty
then a <code>ValueError</code> is raised.
</p>
<p>The response is returned as a <code>bytes</code> object.  For Python 3 if it
is known that the response can be represented as a string then this
can be decoded from the buffer.  For example, if it is known that the
response is an <small>ASCII</small> string:
</p>
<div>
<pre>remote_connection.send_packet(&#34;some_packet&#34;).decode(&#34;ascii&#34;)
</pre></div>

<p>In Python 2 <code>bytes</code> and <code>str</code> are aliases, so the result is
already a string, if the response includes non-printable characters,
or null characters, then these will be present in the result, care
should be taken when processing the result to handle this case.
</p>
<p>The prefix, suffix, and checksum (as required by the remote serial
protocol) are automatically added to the outgoing packet, and removed
from the incoming packet before the contents of the reply are
returned.
</p>
<p>This is equivalent to the <code>maintenance packet</code> command
(see <a href="#maint-packet">maint packet</a>).

the user chooses, new window types are implemented by registering a
factory function with <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p><var>name</var> is the name of the new window.  It’s an error to try to
replace one of the built-in windows, but other window types can be
replaced.
</p>
<p><var>function</var> is a factory function that is called to create the TUI
window.  This is called with a single argument of type
<code>gdb.TuiWindow</code>, described below.  It should return an object
that implements the TUI window protocol, also described below.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>As mentioned above, when a factory function is called, it is passed
an object of type <code>gdb.TuiWindow</code>.  This object has these
methods and attributes:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-TuiWindow_002eis_005fvalid"></a>Function: <strong>TuiWindow.is_valid</strong> <em>()</em></dt>
<dd><p>This method returns <code>True</code> when this window is valid.  When the
user changes the TUI layout, windows no longer visible in the new
layout will be destroyed.  At this point, the <code>gdb.TuiWindow</code>
will no longer be valid, and methods (and attributes) other than
<code>is_valid</code> will throw an exception.
</p>
<p>When the TUI is disabled using <code>tui disable</code> (see <a href="#TUI-Commands">tui disable</a>) the window is hidden rather than destroyed,
but <code>is_valid</code> will still return <code>False</code> and other methods
(and attributes) will still throw an exception.
</p></dd></dl>

as appropriate for the terminal.
</p>
<p>If the <var>full_window</var> parameter is <code>True</code>, then <var>string</var>
contains the full contents of the window.  This is similar to calling
<code>erase</code> before <code>write</code>, but avoids the flickering.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The factory function that you supply should return an object
conforming to the TUI window protocol.  These are the method that can
be called on this object, which is referred to below as the “window
object”.  The methods documented below are optional; if the object
does not implement one of these methods, <small>GDB</small> will not attempt
to call it.  Additional new methods may be added to the window
protocol in the future.  <small>GDB</small> guarantees that they will begin
with a lower-case letter, so you can start implementation methods with
upper-case letters or underscore to avoid any future conflicts.

<h3>23.4 Extending <small>GDB</small> using Guile</h3>
<a name="index-guile-scripting"></a>
<a name="index-scripting-with-guile"></a>

<p>You can extend <small>GDB</small> using the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/">Guile implementation of the Scheme programming language</a>.
This feature is available only if <small>GDB</small> was configured using
<samp>--with-guile</samp>.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Guile-Introduction"></a>

<a name="Guile-Introduction-1"></a>
<h4>23.4.1 Guile Introduction</h4>

<p>Guile is an implementation of the Scheme programming language
and is the GNU project’s official extension language.
</p>
<p>Guile support in <small>GDB</small> follows the Python support in <small>GDB</small>
reasonably closely, so concepts there should carry over.
However, some things are done differently where it makes sense.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> requires Guile version 3.0, 2.2, or 2.0.
</p>
<a name="index-guile-scripts-directory"></a>
<p>Guile scripts used by <small>GDB</small> should be installed in
<samp><var>data-directory</var>/guile</samp>, where <var>data-directory</var> is
the data directory as determined at <small>GDB</small> startup (see <a href="#Data-Files">Data Files</a>).
This directory, known as the <em>guile directory</em>,
is automatically added to the Guile Search Path in order to allow
the Guile interpreter to locate all scripts installed at this location.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Guile-Commands"></a>

<a name="Guile-Commands-1"></a>
<h4>23.4.2 Guile Commands</h4>
<a name="index-guile-commands"></a>
<a name="index-commands-to-access-guile"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> provides two commands for accessing the Guile interpreter:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-guile_002drepl"></a>
<a name="index-gr"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>guile-repl</code></dt>
<dt><code>gr</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>guile-repl</code> command can be used to start an interactive
Guile prompt or <em>repl</em>.  To return to <small>GDB</small>,
type <kbd>,q</kbd> or the <code>EOF</code> character (e.g., <kbd>Ctrl-D</kbd> on
an empty prompt).  These commands do not take any arguments.
</p>
<a name="index-guile"></a>
<a name="index-gu"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>guile <span>[</span><var>scheme-expression</var><span>]</span></code></dt>
<dt><code>gu <span>[</span><var>scheme-expression</var><span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>guile</code> command can be used to evaluate a Scheme expression.
</p>
<p>If given an argument, <small>GDB</small> will pass the argument to the Guile
interpreter for evaluation.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) guile (display (+ 20 3)) (newline)
23
</pre></div>

<p>The result of the Scheme expression is displayed using normal Guile rules.
</p>


<p>If you do not provide an argument to <code>guile</code>, it will act as a
multi-line command, like <code>define</code>.  In this case, the Guile
script is made up of subsequent command lines, given after the
<code>guile</code> command.  This command list is terminated using a line
containing <code>end</code>.  For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) guile
&gt;(display 23)
&gt;(newline)
&gt;end
23
</pre></div>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>It is also possible to execute a Guile script from the <small>GDB</small>
interpreter:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>source <samp>script-name</samp></code></dt>
<dd><p>The script name must end with ‘<samp>.scm</samp>’ and <small>GDB</small> must be configured
to recognize the script language based on filename extension using
the <code>script-extension</code> setting.  See <a href="#Extending-GDB">Extending GDB</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>guile (load &#34;script-name&#34;)</code></dt>
<dd><p>This method uses the <code>load</code> Guile function.
It takes a string argument that is the name of the script to load.
See the Guile documentation for a description of this function.
(see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/guile.html#Loading">Loading</a> in <cite>GNU Guile Reference Manual</cite>).

<a name="Guile-API-1"></a>
<h4>23.4.3 Guile API</h4>
<a name="index-guile-api"></a>
<a name="index-programming-in-guile"></a>

<p>You can get quick online help for <small>GDB</small>’s Guile API by issuing
the command <kbd>help guile</kbd><!-- /@w -->, or by issuing the command <kbd>,help</kbd>
from an interactive Guile session.  Furthermore, most Guile procedures
provided by <small>GDB</small> have doc strings which can be obtained with
<kbd>,describe <var>procedure-name</var></kbd> or <kbd>,d <var>procedure-name</var></kbd>
from the Guile interactive prompt.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Basic-Guile"></a>

<a name="Basic-Guile-1"></a>
<h4>23.4.3.1 Basic Guile</h4>

<a name="index-guile-stdout"></a>
<a name="index-guile-pagination"></a>
<p>At startup, <small>GDB</small> overrides Guile’s <code>current-output-port</code> and
<code>current-error-port</code> to print using <small>GDB</small>’s output-paging streams.
A Guile program which outputs to one of these streams may have its
output interrupted by the user (see <a href="#Screen-Size">Screen Size</a>).  In this
situation, a Guile <code>signal</code> exception is thrown with value <code>SIGINT</code>.
</p>
<p>Guile’s history mechanism uses the same naming as <small>GDB</small>’s,
namely the user of dollar-variables (e.g., $1, $2, etc.).
The results of evaluations in Guile and in GDB are counted separately,
<code>$1</code> in Guile is not the same value as <code>$1</code> in <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> is not thread-safe.  If your Guile program uses multiple
threads, you must be careful to only call <small>GDB</small>-specific
functions in the <small>GDB</small> thread.
</p>
<p>Some care must be taken when writing Guile code to run in
<small>GDB</small>.  Two things are worth noting in particular:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <small>GDB</small> installs handlers for <code>SIGCHLD</code> and <code>SIGINT</code>.
Guile code must not override these, or even change the options using
<code>sigaction</code>.  If your program changes the handling of these
signals, <small>GDB</small> will most likely stop working correctly.  Note
that it is unfortunately common for GUI toolkits to install a
<code>SIGCHLD</code> handler.

</li><li> <small>GDB</small> takes care to mark its internal file descriptors as
close-on-exec.  However, this cannot be done in a thread-safe way on
all platforms.  Your Guile programs should be aware of this and
should both create new file descriptors with the close-on-exec flag
set and arrange to close unneeded file descriptors before starting a
child process.
</li></ul>

<a name="index-guile-gdb-module"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> introduces a new Guile module, named <code>gdb</code>.  All
methods and classes added by <small>GDB</small> are placed in this module.
<small>GDB</small> does not automatically <code>import</code> the <code>gdb</code> module,
scripts must do this themselves.  There are various options for how to
import a module, so <small>GDB</small> leaves the choice of how the <code>gdb</code>
module is imported to the user.
To simplify interactive use, it is recommended to add one of the following
to your ~/.gdbinit.
</p>
<div>
<pre>guile (use-modules (gdb))
</pre></div>

<div>
<pre>guile (use-modules ((gdb) #:renamer (symbol-prefix-proc &#39;gdb:)))
</pre></div>

<p>Which one to choose depends on your preference.
The second one adds <code>gdb:</code> as a prefix to all module functions
and variables.
</p>
<p>The rest of this manual assumes the <code>gdb</code> module has been imported
without any prefix.  See the Guile documentation for <code>use-modules</code>
for more information
(see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/guile.html#Using-Guile-Modules">Using Guile Modules</a> in <cite>GNU Guile Reference Manual</cite>).
</p>
<p>Example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) guile (value-type (make-value 1))
ERROR: Unbound variable: value-type
Error while executing Scheme code.
(gdb) guile (use-modules (gdb))
(gdb) guile (value-type (make-value 1))
int

</pre></div>

<p>The <code>(gdb)</code> module provides these basic Guile functions.

</p>
<p><var>from-tty</var> specifies whether <small>GDB</small> ought to consider this
command as having originated from the user invoking it interactively.
It must be a boolean value.  If omitted, it defaults to <code>#f</code>.
</p>
<p>By default, any output produced by <var>command</var> is sent to
<small>GDB</small>’s standard output (and to the log output if logging is
turned on).  If the <var>to-string</var> parameter is

returned as a string.  The default is <code>#f</code>, in which case the
return value is unspecified.  If <var>to-string</var> is <code>#t</code>, the
<small>GDB</small> virtual terminal will be temporarily set to unlimited width

</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-history_002dref"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>history-ref</strong> <em>number</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a value from <small>GDB</small>’s value history (see <a href="#Value-History">Value History</a>).  The <var>number</var> argument indicates which history element to return.
If <var>number</var> is negative, then <small>GDB</small> will take its absolute value
and count backward from the last element (i.e., the most recent element) to
find the value to return.  If <var>number</var> is zero, then <small>GDB</small> will
return the most recent element.  If the element specified by <var>number</var>
doesn’t exist in the value history, a <code>gdb:error</code> exception will be
raised.
</p>
<p>If no exception is raised, the return value is always an instance of
<code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> (see <a href="#Values-From-Inferior-In-Guile">Values From Inferior In Guile</a>).
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> <small>GDB</small>’s value history is independent of Guile’s.
<code>$1</code> in <small>GDB</small>’s value history contains the result of evaluating
an expression from <small>GDB</small>’s command line and <code>$1</code> from Guile’s

</p>
<p>This function can be useful when implementing a new command
(see <a href="#Commands-In-Guile">Commands In Guile</a>), as it provides a way to parse the
command’s arguments as an expression.
It is also is useful when computing values.
For example, it is the only way to get the value of a

<p>When executing the <code>guile</code> command, Guile exceptions
uncaught within the Guile code are translated to calls to the
<small>GDB</small> error-reporting mechanism.  If the command that called
<code>guile</code> does not handle the error, <small>GDB</small> will
terminate it and report the error according to the setting of
the <code>guile print-stack</code> parameter.
</p>
<p>The <code>guile print-stack</code> parameter has three settings:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>none</code></dt>
<dd><p>Nothing is printed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>message</code></dt>
<dd><p>An error message is printed containing the Guile exception name,
the associated value, and the Guile call stack backtrace at the
point where the exception was raised.  Example:
</p>

ERROR: In procedure memoize-variable-access!:
ERROR: Unbound variable: foo
Error while executing Scheme code.
</pre></div>

<p><small>GDB</small> errors that happen in <small>GDB</small> commands invoked by
Guile code are converted to Guile exceptions.  The type of the
Guile exception depends on the error.
</p>
<p>Guile procedures provided by <small>GDB</small> can throw the standard
Guile exceptions like <code>wrong-type-arg</code> and <code>out-of-range</code>.
</p>
<p>User interrupt (via <kbd>C-c</kbd> or by typing <kbd>q</kbd> at a pagination
prompt) is translated to a Guile <code>signal</code> exception with value
<code>SIGINT</code>.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> Guile procedures can also throw these exceptions:

<a name="index-_003cgdb_003avalue_003e"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> provides values it obtains from the inferior program in
an object of type <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>.  <small>GDB</small> uses this object
for its internal bookkeeping of the inferior’s values, and for
fetching values when necessary.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> does not memoize <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> objects.
<code>make-value</code> always returns a fresh object.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) guile (eq? (make-value 1) (make-value 1))
$1 = #f
(gdb) guile (equal? (make-value 1) (make-value 1))
$1 = #t
</pre></div>

<p>A <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> that represents a function can be executed via
inferior function call with <code>value-call</code>.
Any arguments provided to the call must match the function’s prototype,
and must be provided in the order specified by that prototype.
</p>
<p>For example, <code>some-val</code> is a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> instance
representing a function that takes two integers as arguments.  To
execute this function, call it like so:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(define result (value-call some-val 10 20))
</pre></div>

<p>Any values returned from a function call are <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> objects.
</p>
<p>Note: Unlike Python scripting in <small>GDB</small>,
inferior values that are simple scalars cannot be used directly in
Scheme expressions that are valid for the value’s data type.
For example, <code>(+ (parse-and-eval &#34;int_variable&#34;) 2)</code> does not work.
And inferior values that are structures or instances of some class cannot
be accessed using any special syntax, instead <code>value-field</code> must be used.

<p>The following value-related procedures are provided by the
<code>(gdb)</code> module.

an exception is thrown.  Otherwise the type of the result is determined from
<var>value</var> as described below.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Architectures-In-Guile">Architectures In Guile</a>, for a list of the builtin
types for an architecture.

<dt>Scheme string</dt>
<dd><p>A Scheme string is converted to a string in the current target

Characters that cannot be represented in the current target encoding
are replaced with the corresponding escape sequence.  This is Guile’s
<code>SCM_FAILED_CONVERSION_ESCAPE_SEQUENCE</code> conversion strategy
(see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/manual/guile.html#Strings">Strings</a> in <cite>GNU Guile Reference Manual</cite>).

<dt><a name="index-value_002ddynamic_002dtype"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>value-dynamic-type</strong> <em>value</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the dynamic type of <var>value</var>.  This uses C<tt>++</tt> run-time
type information (<acronym>RTTI</acronym>) to determine the dynamic type of the
value.  If the value is of class type, it will return the class in
which the value is embedded, if any.  If the value is of pointer or
reference to a class type, it will compute the dynamic type of the
referenced object, and return a pointer or reference to that type,
respectively.  In all other cases, it will return the value’s static
type.
</p>
<p>Note that this feature will only work when debugging a C<tt>++</tt> program
that includes <acronym>RTTI</acronym> for the object in question.  Otherwise,
it will just return the static type of the value as in <kbd>ptype foo</kbd>.

<dd><p>Return a new instance of <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> that is the result of

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-value_002ddereference"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>value-dereference</strong> <em>value</em></dt>
<dd><p>For pointer data types, this method returns a new <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> object
whose contents is the object pointed to by <var>value</var>.  For example, if
<code>foo</code> is a C pointer to an <code>int</code>, declared in your C program as
</p>


<p>then you can use the corresponding <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> to access what
<code>foo</code> points to like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(define bar (value-dereference foo))
</pre></div>

<p>The result <code>bar</code> will be a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> object holding the
value pointed to by <code>foo</code>.
</p>
<p>A similar function <code>value-referenced-value</code> exists which also
returns <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> objects corresponding to the values pointed to
by pointer values (and additionally, values referenced by reference
values).  However, the behavior of <code>value-dereference</code>
differs from <code>value-referenced-value</code> by the fact that the
behavior of <code>value-dereference</code> is identical to applying the C
unary operator <code>*</code> on a given value.  For example, consider a
reference to a pointer <code>ptrref</code>, declared in your C<tt>++</tt> program
as
</p>
<div>
<pre>typedef int *intptr;
...
int val = 10;
intptr ptr = &amp;val;
intptr &amp;ptrref = ptr;
</pre></div>

<p>Though <code>ptrref</code> is a reference value, one can apply the method
<code>value-dereference</code> to the <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> object corresponding
to it and obtain a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> which is identical to that
corresponding to <code>val</code>.  However, if you apply the method
<code>value-referenced-value</code>, the result would be a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>
object identical to that corresponding to <code>ptr</code>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(define scm-ptrref (parse-and-eval &#34;ptrref&#34;))
(define scm-val (value-dereference scm-ptrref))
(define scm-ptr (value-referenced-value scm-ptrref))
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> object <code>scm-val</code> is identical to that
corresponding to <code>val</code>, and <code>scm-ptr</code> is identical to that
corresponding to <code>ptr</code>.  In general, <code>value-dereference</code> can
be applied whenever the C unary operator <code>*</code> can be applied
to the corresponding C value.  For those cases where applying both
<code>value-dereference</code> and <code>value-referenced-value</code> is allowed,
the results obtained need not be identical (as we have seen in the above
example).  The results are however identical when applied on
<code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> objects corresponding to pointers (<code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>
objects with type code <code>TYPE_CODE_PTR</code>) in a C/C<tt>++</tt> program.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-value_002dreferenced_002dvalue"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>value-referenced-value</strong> <em>value</em></dt>
<dd><p>For pointer or reference data types, this method returns a new
<code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> object corresponding to the value referenced by the
pointer/reference value.  For pointer data types,
<code>value-dereference</code> and <code>value-referenced-value</code> produce
identical results.  The difference between these methods is that
<code>value-dereference</code> cannot get the values referenced by reference
values.  For example, consider a reference to an <code>int</code>, declared
in your C<tt>++</tt> program as
</p>
<div>
<pre>int val = 10;
int &amp;ref = val;
</pre></div>

<p>then applying <code>value-dereference</code> to the <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> object
corresponding to <code>ref</code> will result in an error, while applying

<var>encoding</var> is the empty string, then either the <code>target-charset</code>
(see <a href="#Character-Sets">Character Sets</a>) will be used, or a language-specific encoding
will be used, if the current language is able to supply one.
</p>
<p>The optional <var>errors</var> argument is one of <code>#f</code>, <code>error</code> or
<code>substitute</code>.  <code>error</code> and <code>substitute</code> must be symbols.
If <var>errors</var> is not specified, or if its value is <code>#f</code>, then the
default conversion strategy is used, which is set with the Scheme function
<code>set-port-conversion-strategy!</code>.
If the value is <code>&#39;error</code> then an exception is thrown if there is any
conversion error.  If the value is <code>&#39;substitute</code> then any conversion
error is replaced with question marks.

</p>
<p>If the optional <var>length</var> argument is given, the string will be
fetched and converted to the given length.
The length must be a Scheme integer and not a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> integer.

<h4>23.4.3.6 Arithmetic In Guile</h4>

<p>The <code>(gdb)</code> module provides several functions for performing
arithmetic on <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> objects.
The arithmetic is performed as if it were done by the target,
and therefore has target semantics which are not necessarily
those of Scheme.  For example operations work with a fixed precision,
not the arbitrary precision of Scheme.
</p>
<p>Wherever a function takes an integer or pointer as an operand,
<small>GDB</small> will convert appropriate Scheme values to perform
the operation.

<a name="index-guile_002c-working-with-types"></a>

<a name="index-_003cgdb_003atype_003e"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> represents types from the inferior in objects of type
<code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>The following type-related procedures are provided by the
<code>(gdb)</code> module.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_003f"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type?</strong> <em>object</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return <code>#t</code> if <var>object</var> is an object of type <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code>.
Otherwise return <code>#f</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-lookup_002dtype"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>lookup-type</strong> <em>name <span>[</span>#:block block<span>]</span></em></dt>
<dd><p>This function looks up a type by its <var>name</var>, which must be a string.
</p>
<p>If <var>block</var> is given, it is an object of type <code>&lt;gdb:block&gt;</code>,
and <var>name</var> is looked up in that scope.
Otherwise, it is searched for globally.
</p>
<p>Ordinarily, this function will return an instance of <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code>.
If the named type cannot be found, it will throw an exception.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dcode"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-code</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the type code of <var>type</var>.  The type code will be one of the
<code>TYPE_CODE_</code> constants defined below.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dtag"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-tag</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the tag name of <var>type</var>.  The tag name is the name after
<code>struct</code>, <code>union</code>, or <code>enum</code> in C and C<tt>++</tt>; not all
languages have this concept.  If this type has no tag name, then
<code>#f</code> is returned.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dname"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-name</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the name of <var>type</var>.
If this type has no name, then <code>#f</code> is returned.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dprint_002dname"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-print-name</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the print name of <var>type</var>.
This returns something even for anonymous types.
For example, for an anonymous C struct <code>&#34;struct {...}&#34;</code> is returned.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dsizeof"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-sizeof</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the size of this type, in target <code>char</code> units.  Usually, a
target’s <code>char</code> type will be an 8-bit byte.  However, on some
unusual platforms, this type may have a different size.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dstrip_002dtypedefs"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-strip-typedefs</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code> that represents the real type of <var>type</var>,
after removing all layers of typedefs.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002darray"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-array</strong> <em>type n1 <span>[</span>n2<span>]</span></em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code> object which represents an array of this
type.  If one argument is given, it is the inclusive upper bound of
the array; in this case the lower bound is zero.  If two arguments are
given, the first argument is the lower bound of the array, and the
second argument is the upper bound of the array.  An array’s length
must not be negative, but the bounds can be.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dvector"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-vector</strong> <em>type n1 <span>[</span>n2<span>]</span></em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code> object which represents a vector of this
type.  If one argument is given, it is the inclusive upper bound of
the vector; in this case the lower bound is zero.  If two arguments are
given, the first argument is the lower bound of the vector, and the
second argument is the upper bound of the vector.  A vector’s length
must not be negative, but the bounds can be.
</p>
<p>The difference between an <code>array</code> and a <code>vector</code> is that
arrays behave like in C: when used in expressions they decay to a pointer
to the first element whereas vectors are treated as first class values.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dpointer"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-pointer</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code> object which represents a pointer to
<var>type</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002drange"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-range</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a list of two elements: the low bound and high bound of <var>type</var>.
If <var>type</var> does not have a range, an exception is thrown.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dreference"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-reference</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code> object which represents a reference to
<var>type</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dtarget"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-target</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code> object which represents the target type
of <var>type</var>.
</p>
<p>For a pointer type, the target type is the type of the pointed-to
object.  For an array type (meaning C-like arrays), the target type is
the type of the elements of the array.  For a function or method type,
the target type is the type of the return value.  For a complex type,
the target type is the type of the elements.  For a typedef, the
target type is the aliased type.
</p>
<p>If the type does not have a target, this method will throw an
exception.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dconst"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-const</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code> object which represents a
<code>const</code>-qualified variant of <var>type</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dvolatile"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-volatile</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code> object which represents a
<code>volatile</code>-qualified variant of <var>type</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dunqualified"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-unqualified</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a new <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code> object which represents an unqualified
variant of <var>type</var>.  That is, the result is neither <code>const</code> nor
<code>volatile</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dnum_002dfields"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-num-fields</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Return the number of fields of <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code> <var>type</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dfields"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-fields</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the fields of <var>type</var> as a list.
For structure and union types, <code>fields</code> has the usual meaning.
Range types have two fields, the minimum and maximum values.  Enum types
have one field per enum constant.  Function and method types have one
field per parameter.  The base types of C<tt>++</tt> classes are also
represented as fields.  If the type has no fields, or does not fit
into one of these categories, an empty list will be returned.
See <a href="#Fields-of-a-type-in-Guile">Fields of a type in Guile</a>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-make_002dfield_002diterator"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-field-iterator</strong> <em>type</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the fields of <var>type</var> as a &lt;gdb:iterator&gt; object.
See <a href="#Iterators-In-Guile">Iterators In Guile</a>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-type_002dfield"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>type-field</strong> <em>type field-name</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return field named <var>field-name</var> in <var>type</var>.
The result is an object of type <code>&lt;gdb:field&gt;</code>.
See <a href="#Fields-of-a-type-in-Guile">Fields of a type in Guile</a>.
If the type does not have fields, or <var>field-name</var> is not a field
of <var>type</var>, an exception is thrown.
</p>
<p>For example, if <code>some-type</code> is a <code>&lt;gdb:type&gt;</code> instance holding
a structure type, you can access its <code>foo</code> field with:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(define bar (type-field some-type &#34;foo&#34;))
</pre></div>

<p><code>bar</code> will be a <code>&lt;gdb:field&gt;</code> object.

Otherwise return <code>#f</code>.

<h4>23.4.3.8 Guile Pretty Printing API</h4>
<a name="index-guile-pretty-printing-api"></a>

<p>An example output is provided (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing">Pretty Printing</a>).
</p>
<p>A pretty-printer is represented by an object of type &lt;gdb:pretty-printer&gt;.
Pretty-printer objects are created with <code>make-pretty-printer</code>.
</p>
<p>The following pretty-printer-related procedures are provided by the
<code>(gdb)</code> module:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-make_002dpretty_002dprinter"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-pretty-printer</strong> <em>name lookup-function</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return a <code>&lt;gdb:pretty-printer&gt;</code> object named <var>name</var>.
</p>
<p><var>lookup-function</var> is a function of one parameter: the value to
be printed.  If the value is handled by this pretty-printer, then
<var>lookup-function</var> returns an object of type
&lt;gdb:pretty-printer-worker&gt; to perform the actual pretty-printing.
Otherwise <var>lookup-function</var> returns <code>#f</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-pretty_002dprinter_003f"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>pretty-printer?</strong> <em>object</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return <code>#t</code> if <var>object</var> is a <code>&lt;gdb:pretty-printer&gt;</code> object.

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-pretty_002dprinter_002denabled_003f"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>pretty-printer-enabled?</strong> <em>pretty-printer</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return <code>#t</code> if <var>pretty-printer</var> is enabled.
Otherwise return <code>#f</code>.

The value returned is unspecified.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>

</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-make_002dpretty_002dprinter_002dworker"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-pretty-printer-worker</strong> <em>display-hint to-string children</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return an object of type <code>&lt;gdb:pretty-printer-worker&gt;</code>.
</p>
<p>This function takes three parameters:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>display-hint</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p><var>display-hint</var> provides a hint to <small>GDB</small> or <small>GDB</small>
front end via MI to change the formatting of the value being printed.
The value must be a string or <code>#f</code> (meaning there is no hint).
Several values for <var>display-hint</var>
are predefined by <small>GDB</small>:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>array</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Indicate that the object being printed is “array-like”.  The CLI
uses this to respect parameters such as <code>set print elements</code> and
<code>set print array</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>map</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Indicate that the object being printed is “map-like”, and that the
children of this value can be assumed to alternate between keys and
values.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>string</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Indicate that the object being printed is “string-like”.  If the
printer’s <code>to-string</code> function returns a Guile string of some
kind, then <small>GDB</small> will call its internal language-specific
string-printing function to format the string.  For the CLI this means
adding quotation marks, possibly escaping some characters, respecting
<code>set print elements</code>, and the like.
</p></dd>
</dl>

</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>to-string</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p><var>to-string</var> is either a function of one parameter, the
<code>&lt;gdb:pretty-printer-worker&gt;</code> object, or <code>#f</code>.
</p>
<p>When printing from the CLI, if the <code>to-string</code> method exists,
then <small>GDB</small> will prepend its result to the values returned by
<code>children</code>.  Exactly how this formatting is done is dependent on
the display hint, and may change as more hints are added.  Also,
depending on the print settings (see <a href="#Print-Settings">Print Settings</a>), the CLI may
print just the result of <code>to-string</code> in a stack trace, omitting
the result of <code>children</code>.
</p>
<p>If this method returns a string, it is printed verbatim.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, if this method returns an instance of <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>,
then <small>GDB</small> prints this value.  This may result in a call to
another pretty-printer.
</p>
<p>If instead the method returns a Guile value which is convertible to a
<code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>, then <small>GDB</small> performs the conversion and prints
the resulting value.  Again, this may result in a call to another
pretty-printer.  Guile scalars (integers, floats, and booleans) and
strings are convertible to <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>; other types are not.
</p>
<p>Finally, if this method returns <code>#f</code> then no further operations
are peformed in this method and nothing is printed.
</p>
<p>If the result is not one of these types, an exception is raised.
</p>
<p><var>to-string</var> may also be <code>#f</code> in which case it is left to
<var>children</var> to print the value.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>children</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p><var>children</var> is either a function of one parameter, the
<code>&lt;gdb:pretty-printer-worker&gt;</code> object, or <code>#f</code>.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> will call this function on a pretty-printer to compute the
children of the pretty-printer’s value.
</p>
<p>This function must return a &lt;gdb:iterator&gt; object.
Each item returned by the iterator must be a tuple holding
two elements.  The first element is the “name” of the child; the
second element is the child’s value.  The value can be any Guile
object which is convertible to a <small>GDB</small> value.
</p>
<p>If <var>children</var> is <code>#f</code>, <small>GDB</small> will act
as though the value has no children.
</p>
<p>Children may be hidden from display based on the value of ‘<samp>set
print max-depth</samp>’ (see <a href="#Print-Settings">Print Settings</a>).
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl>

<p><small>GDB</small> provides a function which can be used to look up the
default pretty-printer for a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-default_002dvisualizer"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>default-visualizer</strong> <em>value</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function takes a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> object as an argument.  If a
pretty-printer for this value exists, then it is returned.  If no such
printer exists, then this returns <code>#f</code>.

<h4>23.4.3.9 Selecting Guile Pretty-Printers</h4>
<a name="index-selecting-guile-pretty_002dprinters"></a>

<p>There are three sets of pretty-printers that <small>GDB</small> searches:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Per-objfile list of pretty-printers (see <a href="#Objfiles-In-Guile">Objfiles In Guile</a>).
</li><li> Per-progspace list of pretty-printers (see <a href="#Progspaces-In-Guile">Progspaces In Guile</a>).
</li><li> The global list of pretty-printers (see <a href="#Guile-Pretty-Printing-API">Guile Pretty Printing API</a>).
These printers are available when debugging any inferior.
</li></ul>

<p>Pretty-printer lookup is done by passing the value to be printed to the
lookup function of each enabled object in turn.
Lookup stops when a lookup function returns a non-<code>#f</code> value
or when the list is exhausted.
Lookup functions must return either a <code>&lt;gdb:pretty-printer-worker&gt;</code>
object or <code>#f</code>.  Otherwise an exception is thrown.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> first checks the result of <code>objfile-pretty-printers</code>
of each <code>&lt;gdb:objfile&gt;</code> in the current program space and iteratively
calls each enabled lookup function in the list for that <code>&lt;gdb:objfile&gt;</code>
until a non-<code>#f</code> object is returned.
If no pretty-printer is found in the objfile lists, <small>GDB</small> then
searches the result of <code>progspace-pretty-printers</code> of the current
program space, calling each enabled function until a non-<code>#f</code> object
is returned.
After these lists have been exhausted, it tries the global pretty-printers
list, obtained with <code>pretty-printers</code>, again calling each enabled
function until a non-<code>#f</code> object is returned.
</p>
<p>The order in which the objfiles are searched is not specified.  For a
given list, functions are always invoked from the head of the list,
and iterated over sequentially until the end of the list, or a
<code>&lt;gdb:pretty-printer-worker&gt;</code> object is returned.
</p>
<p>For various reasons a pretty-printer may not work.
For example, the underlying data structure may have changed and
the pretty-printer is out of date.
</p>
<p>The consequences of a broken pretty-printer are severe enough that
<small>GDB</small> provides support for enabling and disabling individual
printers.  For example, if <code>print frame-arguments</code> is on,
a backtrace can become highly illegible if any argument is printed
with a broken printer.
</p>
<p>Pretty-printers are enabled and disabled from Scheme by calling
<code>set-pretty-printer-enabled!</code>.

<h4>23.4.3.10 Writing a Guile Pretty-Printer</h4>
<a name="index-writing-a-Guile-pretty_002dprinter"></a>

<p>A pretty-printer consists of two basic parts: a lookup function to determine
if the type is supported, and the printer itself.
</p>
<p>Here is an example showing how a <code>std::string</code> printer might be
written.  See <a href="#Guile-Pretty-Printing-API">Guile Pretty Printing API</a>, for details.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(define (make-my-string-printer value)
  &#34;Print a my::string string&#34;
  (make-pretty-printer-worker
   &#34;string&#34;
   (lambda (printer)
     (value-field value &#34;_data&#34;))
   #f))
</pre></div>

<p>And here is an example showing how a lookup function for the printer
example above might be written.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(define (str-lookup-function pretty-printer value)
  (let ((tag (type-tag (value-type value))))
    (and tag
         (string-prefix? &#34;std::string&lt;&#34; tag)
         (make-my-string-printer value))))
</pre></div>

<p>Then to register this printer in the global printer list:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(append-pretty-printer!
 (make-pretty-printer &#34;my-string&#34; str-lookup-function))
</pre></div>

<p>The example lookup function extracts the value’s type, and attempts to
match it to a type that it can pretty-print.  If it is a type the
printer can pretty-print, it will return a &lt;gdb:pretty-printer-worker&gt; object.
If not, it returns <code>#f</code>.
</p>
<p>We recommend that you put your core pretty-printers into a Guile
package.  If your pretty-printers are for use with a library, we
further recommend embedding a version number into the package name.
This practice will enable <small>GDB</small> to load multiple versions of
your pretty-printers at the same time, because they will have
different names.
</p>
<p>You should write auto-loaded code (see <a href="#Guile-Auto_002dloading">Guile Auto-loading</a>) such that it
can be evaluated multiple times without changing its meaning.  An
ideal auto-load file will consist solely of <code>import</code>s of your
printer modules, followed by a call to a register pretty-printers with
the current objfile.
</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, this approach will scale nicely to multiple
inferiors, each potentially using a different library version.
Embedding a version number in the Guile package name will ensure that
<small>GDB</small> is able to load both sets of printers simultaneously.
Then, because the search for pretty-printers is done by objfile, and
because your auto-loaded code took care to register your library’s
printers with a specific objfile, <small>GDB</small> will find the correct
printers for the specific version of the library used by each
inferior.
</p>
<p>To continue the <code>my::string</code> example,
this code might appear in <code>(my-project my-library v1)</code>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(use-modules (gdb))
(define (register-printers objfile)
  (append-objfile-pretty-printer!
   (make-pretty-printer &#34;my-string&#34; str-lookup-function)))
</pre></div>

<p>And then the corresponding contents of the auto-load file would be:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(use-modules (gdb) (my-project my-library v1))
(register-printers (current-objfile))
</pre></div>

<p>The previous example illustrates a basic pretty-printer.
There are a few things that can be improved on.
The printer only handles one type, whereas a library typically has
several types.  One could install a lookup function for each desired type
in the library, but one could also have a single lookup function recognize
several types.  The latter is the conventional way this is handled.
If a pretty-printer can handle multiple data types, then its
<em>subprinters</em> are the printers for the individual data types.
</p>
<p>The <code>(gdb printing)</code> module provides a formal way of solving this
problem (see <a href="#Guile-Printing-Module">Guile Printing Module</a>).
Here is another example that handles multiple types.
</p>
<p>These are the types we are going to pretty-print:
</p>
<div>
<pre>struct foo { int a, b; };
struct bar { struct foo x, y; };
</pre></div>

<p>Here are the printers:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(define (make-foo-printer value)
  &#34;Print a foo object&#34;
  (make-pretty-printer-worker
   &#34;foo&#34;
   (lambda (printer)
     (format #f &#34;a=&lt;~a&gt; b=&lt;~a&gt;&#34;
             (value-field value &#34;a&#34;) (value-field value &#34;a&#34;)))
   #f))

(define (make-bar-printer value)
  &#34;Print a bar object&#34;
  (make-pretty-printer-worker
   &#34;foo&#34;
   (lambda (printer)
     (format #f &#34;x=&lt;~a&gt; y=&lt;~a&gt;&#34;
             (value-field value &#34;x&#34;) (value-field value &#34;y&#34;)))
   #f))
</pre></div>

<p>This example doesn’t need a lookup function, that is handled by the
<code>(gdb printing)</code> module.  Instead a function is provided to build up
the object that handles the lookup.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(use-modules (gdb printing))

(define (build-pretty-printer)
  (let ((pp (make-pretty-printer-collection &#34;my-library&#34;)))
    (pp-collection-add-tag-printer &#34;foo&#34; make-foo-printer)
    (pp-collection-add-tag-printer &#34;bar&#34; make-bar-printer)
    pp))
</pre></div>

<p>And here is the autoload support:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(use-modules (gdb) (my-library))
(append-objfile-pretty-printer! (current-objfile) (build-pretty-printer))
</pre></div>

<p>Finally, when this printer is loaded into <small>GDB</small>, here is the
corresponding output of ‘<samp>info pretty-printer</samp>’:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) info pretty-printer
my_library.so:
  my-library
    foo
    bar
</pre></div>

<a name="index-commands-in-guile"></a>
<a name="index-guile-commands-1"></a>
<p>You can implement new <small>GDB</small> CLI commands in Guile.  A CLI
command object is created with the <code>make-command</code> Guile function,
and added to <small>GDB</small> with the <code>register-command!</code> Guile function.
This two-step approach is taken to separate out the side-effect of adding
the command to <small>GDB</small> from <code>make-command</code>.
</p>
<p>There is no support for multi-line commands, that is commands that
consist of multiple lines and are terminated with <code>end</code>.

<p>The argument <var>name</var> is the name of the command.  If <var>name</var> consists of
multiple words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix
commands.  In this case, if one of the prefix commands does not exist,
an exception is raised.
</p>
<p>The result is the <code>&lt;gdb:command&gt;</code> object representing the command.
The command is not usable until it has been registered with <small>GDB</small>
with <code>register-command!</code>.
</p>
<p>The rest of the arguments are optional.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>invoke</var> is a procedure of three arguments: <var>self</var>,
<var>args</var> and <var>from-tty</var>.  The argument <var>self</var> is the
<code>&lt;gdb:command&gt;</code> object representing the command.
The argument <var>args</var> is a string representing the arguments passed to
the command, after leading and trailing whitespace has been stripped.
The argument <var>from-tty</var> is a boolean flag and specifies whether the
command should consider itself to have been originated from the user
invoking it interactively.  If this function throws an exception,
it is turned into a <small>GDB</small> <code>error</code> call.
Otherwise, the return value is ignored.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>command-class</var> is one of the ‘<samp>COMMAND_</samp>’ constants
defined below.  This argument tells <small>GDB</small> how to categorize the
new command in the help system.  The default is <code>COMMAND_NONE</code>.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>completer</var> is either <code>#f</code>, one of the ‘<samp>COMPLETE_</samp>’
constants defined below, or a procedure, also defined below.
This argument tells <small>GDB</small> how to perform completion
for this command.  If not provided or if the value is <code>#f</code>,
then no completion is performed on the command.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>prefix</var> is a boolean flag indicating whether the new
command is a prefix command; sub-commands of this command may be
registered.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>doc-string</var> is help text for the new command.
If no documentation string is provided, the default value “This command is
not documented.” is used.

<dd><p>If the <var>completer</var> option to <code>make-command</code> is a procedure,
it takes three arguments: <var>self</var> which is the <code>&lt;gdb:command&gt;</code>
object, and <var>text</var> and <var>word</var> which are both strings.
The argument <var>text</var> holds the complete command line up to the cursor’s
location.  The argument <var>word</var> holds the last word of the command line;
this is computed using a word-breaking heuristic.
</p>
<p>All forms of completion are handled by this function, that is,
the <tt>TAB</tt> and <tt>M-?</tt> key bindings (see <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>),
and the <code>complete</code> command (see <a href="#Help">complete</a>).
</p>
<p>This procedure can return several kinds of values:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If the return value is a list, the contents of the list are used as the
completions.  It is up to <var>completer</var> to ensure that the
contents actually do complete the word.  An empty list is
allowed, it means that there were no completions available.  Only
string elements of the list are used; other elements in the

<h4>23.4.3.12 Parameters In Guile</h4>

<a name="index-parameters-in-guile"></a>
<a name="index-guile-parameters"></a>
<a name="index-Parameter-1"></a>
<p>You can implement new <small>GDB</small> <em>parameters</em> using Guile
<a name="DOCF20" href="#FOOT20"><sup>20</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>There are many parameters that already exist and can be set in
<small>GDB</small>.  Two examples are: <code>set follow-fork</code> and
<code>set charset</code>.  Setting these parameters influences certain
behavior in <small>GDB</small>.  Similarly, you can define parameters that
can be used to influence behavior in custom Guile scripts and commands.
</p>
<p>A new parameter is defined with the <code>make-parameter</code> Guile function,
and added to <small>GDB</small> with the <code>register-parameter!</code> Guile function.
This two-step approach is taken to separate out the side-effect of adding
the parameter to <small>GDB</small> from <code>make-parameter</code>.
</p>
<p>Parameters are exposed to the user via the <code>set</code> and
<code>show</code> commands.  See <a href="#Help">Help</a>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-make_002dparameter"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-parameter</strong> <em>name     <span>[</span><span>#:command-class</span> <span>command-class</span><span>]</span><!-- /@w -->     <span>[</span><span>#:parameter-type</span> <span>parameter-type</span><span>]</span><!-- /@w -->     <span>[</span><span>#:enum-list</span> <span>enum-list</span><span>]</span><!-- /@w --> <span>[</span><span>#:set-func</span> <span>set-func</span><span>]</span><!-- /@w -->     <span>[</span><span>#:show-func</span> <span>show-func</span><span>]</span><!-- /@w --> <span>[</span>#:doc doc<span>]</span><!-- /@w -->     <span>[</span><span>#:set-doc</span> <span>set-doc</span><span>]</span><!-- /@w --> <span>[</span><span>#:show-doc</span> <span>show-doc</span><span>]</span><!-- /@w -->     <span>[</span><span>#:initial-value</span> <span>initial-value</span><span>]</span><!-- /@w --></em></dt>
<dd>
<p>The argument <var>name</var> is the name of the new parameter.  If <var>name</var>
consists of multiple words, then the initial words are looked for as prefix
parameters.  An example of this can be illustrated with the
<code>set print</code> set of parameters.  If <var>name</var> is
<code>print foo</code>, then <code>print</code> will be searched as the prefix
parameter.  In this case the parameter can subsequently be accessed in
<small>GDB</small> as <code>set print foo</code>.
If <var>name</var> consists of multiple words, and no prefix parameter group
can be found, an exception is raised.
</p>
<p>The result is the <code>&lt;gdb:parameter&gt;</code> object representing the parameter.
The parameter is not usable until it has been registered with <small>GDB</small>
with <code>register-parameter!</code>.
</p>
<p>The rest of the arguments are optional.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>command-class</var> should be one of the ‘<samp>COMMAND_</samp>’ constants
(see <a href="#Commands-In-Guile">Commands In Guile</a>).  This argument tells <small>GDB</small> how to
categorize the new parameter in the help system.
The default is <code>COMMAND_NONE</code>.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>parameter-type</var> should be one of the ‘<samp>PARAM_</samp>’ constants
defined below.  This argument tells <small>GDB</small> the type of the new
parameter; this information is used for input validation and
completion.  The default is <code>PARAM_BOOLEAN</code>.
</p>
<p>If <var>parameter-type</var> is <code>PARAM_ENUM</code>, then
<var>enum-list</var> must be a list of strings.  These strings
represent the possible values for the parameter.
</p>
<p>If <var>parameter-type</var> is not <code>PARAM_ENUM</code>, then the presence
of <var>enum-list</var> will cause an exception to be thrown.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>set-func</var> is a function of one argument: <var>self</var> which
is the <code>&lt;gdb:parameter&gt;</code> object representing the parameter.
<small>GDB</small> will call this function when a <var>parameter</var>’s value has
been changed via the <code>set</code> API (for example, <kbd>set foo off</kbd>).
The value of the parameter has already been set to the new value.
This function must return a string to be displayed to the user.
<small>GDB</small> will add a trailing newline if the string is non-empty.
<small>GDB</small> generally doesn’t print anything when a parameter is set,
thus typically this function should return ‘<samp>&#34;&#34;</samp>’.
A non-empty string result should typically be used for displaying warnings
and errors.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>show-func</var> is a function of two arguments: <var>self</var> which
is the <code>&lt;gdb:parameter&gt;</code> object representing the parameter, and
<var>svalue</var> which is the string representation of the current value.
<small>GDB</small> will call this function when a <var>parameter</var>’s
<code>show</code> API has been invoked (for example, <kbd>show foo</kbd>).
This function must return a string, and will be displayed to the user.
<small>GDB</small> will add a trailing newline.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>doc</var> is the help text for the new parameter.
If there is no documentation string, a default value is used.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>set-doc</var> is the help text for this parameter’s
<code>set</code> command.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>show-doc</var> is the help text for this parameter’s
<code>show</code> command.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>initial-value</var> specifies the initial value of the parameter.
If it is a function, it takes one parameter, the <code>&lt;gdb:parameter&gt;</code>
object and its result is used as the initial value of the parameter.
The initial value must be valid for the parameter type,
otherwise an exception is thrown.

<h4>23.4.3.15 Accessing inferior stack frames from Guile.</h4>

<a name="index-frames-in-guile"></a>
<p>When the debugged program stops, <small>GDB</small> is able to analyze its call
stack (see <a href="#Frames">Stack frames</a>).  The <code>&lt;gdb:frame&gt;</code> class
represents a frame in the stack.  A <code>&lt;gdb:frame&gt;</code> object is only valid
while its corresponding frame exists in the inferior’s stack.  If you try
to use an invalid frame object, <small>GDB</small> will throw a
<code>gdb:invalid-object</code> exception (see <a href="#Guile-Exception-Handling">Guile Exception Handling</a>).
</p>
<p>Two <code>&lt;gdb:frame&gt;</code> objects can be compared for equality with the
<code>equal?</code> function, like:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) guile (equal? (newest-frame) (selected-frame))
#t
</pre></div>

<p>The following frame-related procedures are provided by the
<code>(gdb)</code> module:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-frame_003f"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>frame?</strong> <em>object</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return <code>#t</code> if <var>object</var> is a <code>&lt;gdb:frame&gt;</code> object.
Otherwise return <code>#f</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-frame_002dvalid_003f"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>frame-valid?</strong> <em>frame</em></dt>
<dd><p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <var>frame</var> is valid, <code>#f</code> if not.
A frame object can become invalid if the frame it refers to doesn’t
exist anymore in the inferior.  All <code>&lt;gdb:frame&gt;</code> procedures will throw
an exception if the frame is invalid at the time the procedure is called.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-frame_002dname"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>frame-name</strong> <em>frame</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the function name of <var>frame</var>, or <code>#f</code> if it can’t be
obtained.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-frame_002darch"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>frame-arch</strong> <em>frame</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the <code>&lt;gdb:architecture&gt;</code> object corresponding to <var>frame</var>’s

</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-frame_002dtype"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>frame-type</strong> <em>frame</em></dt>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>NORMAL_FRAME</code></dt>
<dd><p>An ordinary stack frame.

</dd>
<dt><code>DUMMY_FRAME</code></dt>
<dd><p>A fake stack frame that was created by <small>GDB</small> when performing an
inferior function call.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>INLINE_FRAME</code></dt>
<dd><p>A frame representing an inlined function.  The function was inlined
into a <code>NORMAL_FRAME</code> that is older than this one.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>TAILCALL_FRAME</code></dt>
<dd><p>A frame representing a tail call.  See <a href="#Tail-Call-Frames">Tail Call Frames</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SIGTRAMP_FRAME</code></dt>
<dd><p>A signal trampoline frame.  This is the frame created by the OS when
it calls into a signal handler.

<dd><p>This frame ID looks like it ought to belong to a NEXT frame,
but we got it for a PREV frame.  Normally, this is a sign of
unwinder failure.  It could also indicate stack corruption.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>FRAME_UNWIND_SAME_ID</code></dt>
<dd><p>This frame has the same ID as the previous one.  That means

<h4>23.4.3.16 Accessing blocks from Guile.</h4>

<a name="index-blocks-in-guile"></a>
<a name="index-_003cgdb_003ablock_003e"></a>

<p>In <small>GDB</small>, symbols are stored in blocks.  A block corresponds
roughly to a scope in the source code.  Blocks are organized
hierarchically, and are represented individually in Guile as an object
of type <code>&lt;gdb:block&gt;</code>.  Blocks rely on debugging information being
available.
</p>
<p>A frame has a block.  Please see <a href="#Frames-In-Guile">Frames In Guile</a>, for a more
in-depth discussion of frames.
</p>
<p>The outermost block is known as the <em>global block</em>.  The global
block typically holds public global variables and functions.
</p>
<p>The block nested just inside the global block is the <em>static
block</em>.  The static block typically holds file-scoped variables and
functions.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> provides a method to get a block’s superblock, but there
is currently no way to examine the sub-blocks of a block, or to
iterate over all the blocks in a symbol table (see <a href="#Symbol-Tables-In-Guile">Symbol Tables In Guile</a>).
</p>
<p>Here is a short example that should help explain blocks:
</p>
<div>
<pre>/* This is in the global block.  */
int global;

/* This is in the static block.  */
static int file_scope;

/* &#39;function&#39; is in the global block, and &#39;argument&#39; is
   in a block nested inside of &#39;function&#39;.  */
int function (int argument)
{
  /* &#39;local&#39; is in a block inside &#39;function&#39;.  It may or may
     not be in the same block as &#39;argument&#39;.  */
  int local;

  {
     /* &#39;inner&#39; is in a block whose superblock is the one holding
        &#39;local&#39;.  */
     int inner;

     /* If this call is expanded by the compiler, you may see
        a nested block here whose function is &#39;inline_function&#39;
        and whose superblock is the one holding &#39;inner&#39;.  */
     inline_function ();
  }
}
</pre></div>

<p>The following block-related procedures are provided by the
<code>(gdb)</code> module:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-block_003f"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>block?</strong> <em>object</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return <code>#t</code> if <var>object</var> is a <code>&lt;gdb:block&gt;</code> object.

<dl>

<dd><p>Returns <code>#t</code> if <code>&lt;gdb:block&gt;</code> <var>block</var> is valid,
<code>#f</code> if not.  A block object can become invalid if the block it
refers to doesn’t exist anymore in the inferior.  All other
<code>&lt;gdb:block&gt;</code> methods will throw an exception if it is invalid at
the time the procedure is called.  The block’s validity is also checked
during iteration over symbols of the block.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-block_002dstart"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>block-start</strong> <em>block</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the start address of <code>&lt;gdb:block&gt;</code> <var>block</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-block_002dend"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>block-end</strong> <em>block</em></dt>

<dd><p>Return the name of <code>&lt;gdb:block&gt;</code> <var>block</var> represented as a
<code>&lt;gdb:symbol&gt;</code> object.
If the block is not named, then <code>#f</code> is returned.
</p>
<p>For ordinary function blocks, the superblock is the static block.
However, you should note that it is possible for a function block to
have a superblock that is not the static block – for instance this
happens for an inlined function.
</p></dd></dl>

<h4>23.4.3.19 Manipulating breakpoints using Guile</h4>

<a name="index-breakpoints-in-guile"></a>
<a name="index-_003cgdb_003abreakpoint_003e"></a>

<p>Breakpoints in Guile are represented by objects of type
<code>&lt;gdb:breakpoint&gt;</code>.  New breakpoints can be created with the
<code>make-breakpoint</code> Guile function, and then added to <small>GDB</small> with the
<code>register-breakpoint!</code> Guile function.
This two-step approach is taken to separate out the side-effect of adding
the breakpoint to <small>GDB</small> from <code>make-breakpoint</code>.
</p>
<p>Support is also provided to view and manipulate breakpoints created
outside of Guile.
</p>
<p>The following breakpoint-related procedures are provided by the
<code>(gdb)</code> module:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-make_002dbreakpoint"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-breakpoint</strong> <em>location <span>[</span>#:type type<span>]</span><!-- /@w -->     <span>[</span><span>#:wp-class</span> <span>wp-class</span><span>]</span><!-- /@w --> <span>[</span>#:internal internal<span>]</span><!-- /@w -->     <span>[</span>#:temporary temporary<span>]</span><!-- /@w --></em></dt>
<dd><p>Create a new breakpoint at <var>location</var>, a string naming the
location of the breakpoint, or an expression that defines a watchpoint.
The contents can be any location recognized by the <code>break</code> command,
or in the case of a watchpoint, by the <code>watch</code> command.
</p>
<p>The breakpoint is initially marked as ‘<samp>invalid</samp>’.
The breakpoint is not usable until it has been registered with <small>GDB</small>
with <code>register-breakpoint!</code>, at which point it becomes ‘<samp>valid</samp>’.
The result is the <code>&lt;gdb:breakpoint&gt;</code> object representing the breakpoint.
</p>
<p>The optional <var>type</var> denotes the breakpoint to create.
This argument can be either <code>BP_BREAKPOINT</code> or <code>BP_WATCHPOINT</code>,
and defaults to <code>BP_BREAKPOINT</code>.
</p>
<p>The optional <var>wp-class</var> argument defines the class of watchpoint to
create, if <var>type</var> is <code>BP_WATCHPOINT</code>.  If a watchpoint class is
not provided, it is assumed to be a <code>WP_WRITE</code> class.
</p>
<p>The optional <var>internal</var> argument allows the breakpoint to become
invisible to the user.  The breakpoint will neither be reported when
registered, nor will it be listed in the output from <code>info breakpoints</code>
(but will be listed with the <code>maint info breakpoints</code> command).
If an internal flag is not provided, the breakpoint is visible
(non-internal).
</p>
<p>The optional <var>temporary</var> argument makes the breakpoint a temporary
breakpoint.  Temporary breakpoints are deleted after they have been hit,
after which the Guile breakpoint is no longer usable (although it may be
re-registered with <code>register-breakpoint!</code>).
</p>
<p>When a watchpoint is created, <small>GDB</small> will try to create a
hardware assisted watchpoint.  If successful, the type of the watchpoint
is changed from <code>BP_WATCHPOINT</code> to <code>BP_HARDWARE_WATCHPOINT</code>
for <code>WP_WRITE</code>, <code>BP_READ_WATCHPOINT</code> for <code>WP_READ</code>,
and <code>BP_ACCESS_WATCHPOINT</code> for <code>WP_ACCESS</code>.
If not successful, the type of the watchpoint is left as <code>WP_WATCHPOINT</code>.

<a name="index-lazy-strings-in-guile"></a>
<a name="index-_003cgdb_003alazy_002dstring_003e"></a>

<p>A <em>lazy string</em> is a string whose contents is not retrieved or
encoded until it is needed.
</p>
<p>A <code>&lt;gdb:lazy-string&gt;</code> is represented in <small>GDB</small> as an
<code>address</code> that points to a region of memory, an <code>encoding</code>
that will be used to encode that region of memory, and a <code>length</code>
to delimit the region of memory that represents the string.  The
difference between a <code>&lt;gdb:lazy-string&gt;</code> and a string wrapped within
a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code> is that a <code>&lt;gdb:lazy-string&gt;</code> will be treated
differently by <small>GDB</small> when printing.  A <code>&lt;gdb:lazy-string&gt;</code> is
retrieved and encoded during printing, while a <code>&lt;gdb:value&gt;</code>
wrapping a string is immediately retrieved and encoded on creation.
</p>
<p>The following lazy-string-related procedures are provided by the
<code>(gdb)</code> module:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-lazy_002dstring_003f"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>lazy-string?</strong> <em>object</em></dt>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-lazy_002dstring_002dlength"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>lazy-string-length</strong> <em>lazy-string</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the length of <var>lazy-string</var> in characters.  If the
length is -1, then the string will be fetched and encoded up to the

<dd><p>Return the encoding that will be applied to <var>lazy-string</var>
when the string is printed by <small>GDB</small>.  If the encoding is not
set, or contains an empty string,  then <small>GDB</small> will select the

<p>The optional argument <var>offset</var> specifies the address offset of the

<h4>23.4.3.25 Iterators In Guile</h4>

<a name="index-guile-iterators"></a>
<a name="index-_003cgdb_003aiterator_003e"></a>

<p>A simple iterator facility is provided to allow, for example,
iterating over the set of program symbols without having to first
construct a list of all of them.  A useful contribution would be
to add support for SRFI 41 and SRFI 45.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-make_002diterator"></a>Scheme Procedure: <strong>make-iterator</strong> <em>object progress next!</em></dt>
<dd><p>A <code>&lt;gdb:iterator&gt;</code> object is constructed with the <code>make-iterator</code>
procedure.  It takes three arguments: the object to be iterated over,
an object to record the progress of the iteration, and a procedure to
return the next element in the iteration, or an implementation chosen value
to denote the end of iteration.
</p>
<p>By convention, end of iteration is marked with <code>(end-of-iteration)</code>,
and may be tested with the <code>end-of-iteration?</code> predicate.
The result of <code>(end-of-iteration)</code> is chosen so that it is not
otherwise used by the <code>(gdb)</code> module.  If you are using
<code>&lt;gdb:iterator&gt;</code> in your own code it is your responsibility to
maintain this invariant.
</p>
<p>A trivial example for illustration’s sake:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(use-modules (gdb iterator))
(define my-list (list 1 2 3))
(define iter
  (make-iterator my-list my-list
                 (lambda (iter)
                   (let ((l (iterator-progress iter)))
                     (if (eq? l &#39;())
                         (end-of-iteration)
                         (begin
                           (set-iterator-progress! iter (cdr l))
                           (car l)))))))
</pre></div>

<p>Here is a slightly more realistic example, which computes a list of all the
functions in <code>my-global-block</code>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(use-modules (gdb iterator))
(define this-sal (find-pc-line (frame-pc (selected-frame))))

<h3>23.5 Auto-loading extensions</h3>
<a name="index-auto_002dloading-extensions"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> provides two mechanisms for automatically loading
extensions when a new object file is read (for example, due to the
<code>file</code> command, or because the inferior has loaded a shared
library): <samp><var>objfile</var>-gdb.<var>ext</var></samp> (see <a href="#objfile_002dgdbdotext-file">The <samp><var>objfile</var>-gdb.<var>ext</var></samp> file</a>) and the
<code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> section of modern file formats like ELF
(see <a href="#dotdebug_005fgdb_005fscripts-section">The <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code>
section</a>).  For a discussion of the differences between these two
approaches see <a href="#Which-flavor-to-choose_003f">Which flavor to choose?</a>.
</p>
<p>The auto-loading feature is useful for supplying application-specific
debugging commands and features.
</p>
<p>Auto-loading can be enabled or disabled,
and the list of auto-loaded scripts can be printed.
See the ‘<samp>auto-loading</samp>’ section of each extension language
for more information.

For Python files see <a href="#Python-Auto_002dloading">Python Auto-loading</a>.

<p>When a new object file is read, <small>GDB</small> looks for a file named
<samp><var>objfile</var>-gdb.<var>ext</var></samp> (we call it <var>script-name</var> below),
where <var>objfile</var> is the object file’s name and
where <var>ext</var> is the file extension for the extension language:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<dd><p>Python
</p></dd>
<dt><code><samp><var>objfile</var>-gdb.scm</samp></code></dt>
<dd><p>Guile
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p><var>script-name</var> is formed by ensuring that the file name of <var>objfile</var>
is absolute, following all symlinks, and resolving <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>
components, and appending the <samp>-gdb.<var>ext</var></samp> suffix.
If this file exists and is readable, <small>GDB</small> will evaluate it as a
script in the specified extension language.
</p>
<p>If this file does not exist, then <small>GDB</small> will look for
<var>script-name</var> file in all of the directories as specified below.
(On MS-Windows/MS-DOS, the drive letter of the executable’s leading
directories is converted to a one-letter subdirectory, i.e.
<samp>d:/usr/bin/</samp> is converted to <samp>/d/usr/bin/</samp>, because Windows
filesystems disallow colons in file names.)
</p>
<p>Note that loading of these files requires an accordingly configured
<code>auto-load safe-path</code> (see <a href="#Auto_002dloading-safe-path">Auto-loading safe path</a>).
</p>
<p>For object files using <samp>.exe</samp> suffix <small>GDB</small> tries to load first the
scripts normally according to its <samp>.exe</samp> filename.  But if no scripts are
found <small>GDB</small> also tries script filenames matching the object file without
its <samp>.exe</samp> suffix.  This <samp>.exe</samp> stripping is case insensitive and it
is attempted on any platform.  This makes the script filenames compatible
between Unix and MS-Windows hosts.

platform.
</p>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>SECTION_SCRIPT_ID_PYTHON_FILE = 1</code></dt>
<dt><code>SECTION_SCRIPT_ID_SCHEME_FILE = 3</code></dt>
<dt><code>SECTION_SCRIPT_ID_PYTHON_TEXT = 4</code></dt>
<dt><code>SECTION_SCRIPT_ID_SCHEME_TEXT = 6</code></dt>
</dl>

<a name="Script-File-Entries"></a>
<h4>23.5.2.1 Script File Entries</h4>

<p>If the entry specifies a file, <small>GDB</small> will look for the file first
in the current directory and then along the source search path
(see <a href="#Source-Path">Specifying Source Directories</a>),
except that <samp>$cdir</samp> is not searched, since the compilation
directory is not relevant to scripts.
</p>
<p>File entries can be placed in section <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> with,
for example, this GCC macro for Python scripts.
</p>
<div>
<pre>/* Note: The &#34;MS&#34; section flags are to remove duplicates.  */
#define DEFINE_GDB_PY_SCRIPT(script_name) \
  asm(&#34;\
.pushsection \&#34;.debug_gdb_scripts\&#34;, \&#34;MS\&#34;,@progbits,1\n\
.byte 1 /* Python */\n\
.asciz \&#34;&#34; script_name &#34;\&#34;\n\
.popsection \n\
&#34;);
</pre></div>

<p>For Guile scripts, replace <code>.byte 1</code> with <code>.byte 3</code>.
Then one can reference the macro in a header or source file like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>DEFINE_GDB_PY_SCRIPT (&#34;my-app-scripts.py&#34;)
</pre></div>

<p>The script name may include directories if desired.
</p>
<p>Note that loading of this script file also requires accordingly configured
<code>auto-load safe-path</code> (see <a href="#Auto_002dloading-safe-path">Auto-loading safe path</a>).
</p>
<p>If the macro invocation is put in a header, any application or library
using this header will get a reference to the specified script,
and with the use of <code>&#34;MS&#34;</code> attributes on the section, the linker
will remove duplicates.
</p>
<a name="Script-Text-Entries"></a>
<h4>23.5.2.2 Script Text Entries</h4>

<p>Script text entries allow to put the executable script in the entry
itself instead of loading it from a file.
The first line of the entry, everything after the prefix byte and up to
the first newline (<code>0xa</code>) character, is the script name, and must not
contain any kind of space character, e.g., spaces or tabs.
The rest of the entry, up to the trailing null byte, is the script to
execute in the specified language.  The name needs to be unique among
all script names, as <small>GDB</small> executes each script only once based
on its name.
</p>
<p>Here is an example from file <samp>py-section-script.c</samp> in the <small>GDB</small>
testsuite.
</p>
<div>
<pre>#include &#34;symcat.h&#34;
#include &#34;gdb/section-scripts.h&#34;
asm(
&#34;.pushsection \&#34;.debug_gdb_scripts\&#34;, \&#34;MS\&#34;,@progbits,1\n&#34;
&#34;.byte &#34; XSTRING (SECTION_SCRIPT_ID_PYTHON_TEXT) &#34;\n&#34;
&#34;.ascii \&#34;gdb.inlined-script\\n\&#34;\n&#34;
&#34;.ascii \&#34;class test_cmd (gdb.Command):\\n\&#34;\n&#34;
&#34;.ascii \&#34;  def __init__ (self):\\n\&#34;\n&#34;
&#34;.ascii \&#34;    super (test_cmd, self).__init__ (&#34;
    &#34;\\\&#34;test-cmd\\\&#34;, gdb.COMMAND_OBSCURE)\\n\&#34;\n&#34;
&#34;.ascii \&#34;  def invoke (self, arg, from_tty):\\n\&#34;\n&#34;
&#34;.ascii \&#34;    print (\\\&#34;test-cmd output, arg = %s\\\&#34; % arg)\\n\&#34;\n&#34;
&#34;.ascii \&#34;test_cmd ()\\n\&#34;\n&#34;
&#34;.byte 0\n&#34;
&#34;.popsection\n&#34;
);
</pre></div>

<p>Loading of inlined scripts requires a properly configured
<code>auto-load safe-path</code> (see <a href="#Auto_002dloading-safe-path">Auto-loading safe path</a>).
The path to specify in <code>auto-load safe-path</code> is the path of the file
containing the <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> section.

<h4>23.5.3 Which flavor to choose?</h4>

<p>Given the multiple ways of auto-loading extensions, it might not always
be clear which one to choose.  This section provides some guidance.
</p>
<p>Benefits of the <samp>-gdb.<var>ext</var></samp> way:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Can be used with file formats that don’t support multiple sections.

</li><li> Ease of finding scripts for public libraries.

<p>Scripts specified in the <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> section are searched for
in the source search path.
For publicly installed libraries, e.g., <samp>libstdc++</samp>, there typically
isn’t a source directory in which to find the script.
</p>
</li><li> Doesn’t require source code additions.
</li></ul>

<p>Benefits of the <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> way:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Works with static linking.

<p>Scripts for libraries done the <samp>-gdb.<var>ext</var></samp> way require an objfile to
trigger their loading.  When an application is statically linked the only
objfile available is the executable, and it is cumbersome to attach all the
scripts from all the input libraries to the executable’s
<samp>-gdb.<var>ext</var></samp> script.
</p>
</li><li> Works with classes that are entirely inlined.

<p>Some classes can be entirely inlined, and thus there may not be an associated
shared library to attach a <samp>-gdb.<var>ext</var></samp> script to.
</p>
</li><li> Scripts needn’t be copied out of the source tree.

<p>In some circumstances, apps can be built out of large collections of internal
libraries, and the build infrastructure necessary to install the
<samp>-gdb.<var>ext</var></samp> scripts in a place where <small>GDB</small> can find them is
cumbersome.  It may be easier to specify the scripts in the
<code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code> section as relative paths, and add a path to the
top of the source tree to the source search path.

<h3>23.6 Multiple Extension Languages</h3>

<p>The Guile and Python extension languages do not share any state,
and generally do not interfere with each other.
There are some things to be aware of, however.
</p>
<a name="Python-comes-first"></a>
<h4>23.6.1 Python comes first</h4>

<p>Python was <small>GDB</small>’s first extension language, and to avoid breaking
existing behaviour Python comes first.  This is generally solved by the
“first one wins” principle.  <small>GDB</small> maintains a list of enabled
extension languages, and when it makes a call to an extension language,
(say to pretty-print a value), it tries each in turn until an extension
language indicates it has performed the request (e.g., has returned the
pretty-printed form of a value).
This extends to errors while performing such requests: If an error happens
while, for example, trying to pretty-print an object then the error is
reported and any following extension languages are not tried.

<a name="Interpreters"></a>

<a name="Command-Interpreters"></a>
<h2>24 Command Interpreters</h2>
<a name="index-command-interpreters"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> supports multiple command interpreters, and some command
infrastructure to allow users or user interface writers to switch
between interpreters or run commands in other interpreters.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> currently supports two command interpreters, the console
interpreter (sometimes called the command-line interpreter or <small>CLI</small>)
and the machine interface interpreter (or <small>GDB/MI</small>).  This manual
describes both of these interfaces in great detail.
</p>
<p>By default, <small>GDB</small> will start with the console interpreter.
However, the user may choose to start <small>GDB</small> with another
interpreter by specifying the <samp>-i</samp> or <samp>--interpreter</samp>
startup options.  Defined interpreters include:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>console</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-console-interpreter"></a>
<p>The traditional console or command-line interpreter.  This is the most often
used interpreter with <small>GDB</small>. With no interpreter specified at runtime,
<small>GDB</small> will use this interpreter.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mi</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-mi-interpreter"></a>
<p>The newest <small>GDB/MI</small> interface (currently <code>mi3</code>).  Used primarily
by programs wishing to use <small>GDB</small> as a backend for a debugger GUI
or an IDE.  For more information, see <a href="#GDB_002fMI">The <small>GDB/MI</small>
Interface</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mi3</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-mi3-interpreter"></a>
<p>The <small>GDB/MI</small> interface introduced in <small>GDB</small> 9.1.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mi2</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-mi2-interpreter"></a>
<p>The <small>GDB/MI</small> interface introduced in <small>GDB</small> 6.0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mi1</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-mi1-interpreter"></a>
<p>The <small>GDB/MI</small> interface introduced in <small>GDB</small> 5.1.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<a name="index-invoke-another-interpreter"></a>

<a name="index-interpreter_002dexec"></a>
<p>You may execute commands in any interpreter from the current
interpreter using the appropriate command.  If you are running the
console interpreter, simply use the <code>interpreter-exec</code> command:
</p>
<div>
<pre>interpreter-exec mi &#34;-data-list-register-names&#34;
</pre></div>

<p><small>GDB/MI</small> has a similar command, although it is only available in versions of
<small>GDB</small> which support <small>GDB/MI</small> version 2 (or greater).
</p>
<p>Note that <code>interpreter-exec</code> only changes the interpreter for the
duration of the specified command.  It does not change the interpreter
permanently.
</p>
<a name="index-start-a-new-independent-interpreter"></a>

<p>Although you may only choose a single interpreter at startup, it is
possible to run an independent interpreter on a specified input/output
device (usually a tty).
</p>
<p>For example, consider a debugger GUI or IDE that wants to provide a
<small>GDB</small> console view.  It may do so by embedding a terminal
emulator widget in its GUI, starting <small>GDB</small> in the traditional
command-line mode with stdin/stdout/stderr redirected to that
terminal, and then creating an MI interpreter running on a specified
input/output device.  The console interpreter created by <small>GDB</small>
at startup handles commands the user types in the terminal widget,
while the GUI controls and synchronizes state with <small>GDB</small> using
the separate MI interpreter.
</p>
<p>To start a new secondary <em>user interface</em> running MI, use the
<code>new-ui</code> command:
</p>
<a name="index-new_002dui"></a>
<a name="index-new-user-interface"></a>


<p>The <var>interpreter</var> parameter specifies the interpreter to run.
This accepts the same values as the <code>interpreter-exec</code> command.
For example, ‘<samp>console</samp>’, ‘<samp>mi</samp>’, ‘<samp>mi2</samp>’, etc.  The
<var>tty</var> parameter specifies the name of the bidirectional file the
interpreter uses for input/output, usually the name of a
pseudoterminal slave on Unix systems.  For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) new-ui mi /dev/pts/9
</pre></div>

<p>runs an MI interpreter on <samp>/dev/pts/9</samp>.

<a name="GDB-Text-User-Interface"></a>
<h2>25 <small>GDB</small> Text User Interface</h2>
<a name="index-TUI"></a>
<a name="index-Text-User-Interface"></a>

<p>The <small>GDB</small> Text User Interface (TUI) is a terminal
interface which uses the <code>curses</code> library to show the source
file, the assembly output, the program registers and <small>GDB</small>
commands in separate text windows.  The TUI mode is supported only
on platforms where a suitable version of the <code>curses</code> library
is available.
</p>
<p>The TUI mode is enabled by default when you invoke <small>GDB</small> as
‘<samp>gdb -tui</samp>’.
You can also switch in and out of TUI mode while <small>GDB</small> runs by
using various TUI commands and key bindings, such as <code>tui
enable</code> or <kbd>C-x C-a</kbd>.  See <a href="#TUI-Commands">TUI Commands</a>, and
<a href="#TUI-Keys">TUI Key Bindings</a>.

<a name="TUI-Overview"></a>

<a name="TUI-Overview-1"></a>
<h3>25.1 TUI Overview</h3>

<p>In TUI mode, <small>GDB</small> can display several text windows:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>command</em></dt>
<dd><p>This window is the <small>GDB</small> command window with the <small>GDB</small>
prompt and the <small>GDB</small> output.  The <small>GDB</small> input is still
managed using readline.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>source</em></dt>
<dd><p>The source window shows the source file of the program.  The current
line and active breakpoints are displayed in this window.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>assembly</em></dt>
<dd><p>The assembly window shows the disassembly output of the program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>register</em></dt>
<dd><p>This window shows the processor registers.  Registers are highlighted
when their values change.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The source and assembly windows show the current program position
by highlighting the current line and marking it with a ‘<samp>&gt;</samp>’ marker.
Breakpoints are indicated with two markers.  The first marker
indicates the breakpoint type:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>B</code></dt>
<dd><p>Breakpoint which was hit at least once.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>b</code></dt>
<dd><p>Breakpoint which was never hit.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>H</code></dt>
<dd><p>Hardware breakpoint which was hit at least once.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>h</code></dt>
<dd><p>Hardware breakpoint which was never hit.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The second marker indicates whether the breakpoint is enabled or not:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>+</code></dt>
<dd><p>Breakpoint is enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-</code></dt>
<dd><p>Breakpoint is disabled.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The source, assembly and register windows are updated when the current
thread changes, when the frame changes, or when the program counter
changes.
</p>
<p>These windows are not all visible at the same time.  The command
window is always visible.  The others can be arranged in several
layouts:
</p>
<ul>
<li> source only,

</li><li> assembly only,

</li><li> source and assembly,

</li><li> source and registers, or

</li><li> assembly and registers.
</li></ul>

<p>These are the standard layouts, but other layouts can be defined.
</p>
<p>A status line above the command window shows the following information:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><em>target</em></dt>
<dd><p>Indicates the current <small>GDB</small> target.
(see <a href="#Targets">Specifying a Debugging Target</a>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>process</em></dt>
<dd><p>Gives the current process or thread number.
When no process is being debugged, this field is set to <code>No process</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>function</em></dt>
<dd><p>Gives the current function name for the selected frame.
The name is demangled if demangling is turned on (see <a href="#Print-Settings">Print Settings</a>).
When there is no symbol corresponding to the current program counter,
the string <code>??</code> is displayed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>line</em></dt>
<dd><p>Indicates the current line number for the selected frame.
When the current line number is not known, the string <code>??</code> is displayed.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em>pc</em></dt>
<dd><p>Indicates the current program counter address.

<a name="TUI-Key-Bindings"></a>
<h3>25.2 TUI Key Bindings</h3>
<a name="index-TUI-key-bindings"></a>

<p>The TUI installs several key bindings in the readline keymaps
(see <a href="#Command-Line-Editing">Command Line Editing</a>).
The following key bindings are installed for both TUI mode and the
<small>GDB</small> standard mode.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-C_002dx-C_002da"></a>

<dt><kbd>C-x a</kbd></dt>
<dd><a name="index-C_002dx-A"></a>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-x A</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Enter or leave the TUI mode.  When leaving the TUI mode,
the curses window management stops and <small>GDB</small> operates using
its standard mode, writing on the terminal directly.  When reentering
the TUI mode, control is given back to the curses windows.
The screen is then refreshed.
</p>
<p>This key binding uses the bindable Readline function
<code>tui-switch-mode</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-C_002dx-1"></a>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-x 1</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Use a TUI layout with only one window.  The layout will
either be ‘<samp>source</samp>’ or ‘<samp>assembly</samp>’.  When the TUI mode
is not active, it will switch to the TUI mode.
</p>
<p>Think of this key binding as the Emacs <kbd>C-x 1</kbd> binding.
</p>
<p>This key binding uses the bindable Readline function
<code>tui-delete-other-windows</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-C_002dx-2"></a>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-x 2</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Use a TUI layout with at least two windows.  When the current
layout already has two windows, the next layout with two windows is used.
When a new layout is chosen, one window will always be common to the
previous layout and the new one.
</p>
<p>Think of it as the Emacs <kbd>C-x 2</kbd> binding.
</p>
<p>This key binding uses the bindable Readline function
<code>tui-change-windows</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-C_002dx-o"></a>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-x o</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Change the active window.  The TUI associates several key bindings
(like scrolling and arrow keys) with the active window.  This command
gives the focus to the next TUI window.
</p>
<p>Think of it as the Emacs <kbd>C-x o</kbd> binding.
</p>
<p>This key binding uses the bindable Readline function
<code>tui-other-window</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-C_002dx-s"></a>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-x s</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Switch in and out of the TUI SingleKey mode that binds single
keys to <small>GDB</small> commands (see <a href="#TUI-Single-Key-Mode">TUI Single Key Mode</a>).
</p>
<p>This key binding uses the bindable Readline function
<code>next-keymap</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The following key bindings only work in the TUI mode:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-PgUp"></a>
</dd>
<dt><tt>PgUp</tt></dt>
<dd><p>Scroll the active window one page up.

</dl>

<p>Because the arrow keys scroll the active window in the TUI mode, they
are not available for their normal use by readline unless the command
window has the focus.  When another window is active, you must use
other readline key bindings such as <kbd>C-p</kbd>, <kbd>C-n</kbd>, <kbd>C-b</kbd>
and <kbd>C-f</kbd> to control the command window.

<p>Other keys temporarily switch to the <small>GDB</small> command prompt.
The key that was pressed is inserted in the editing buffer so that
it is possible to type most <small>GDB</small> commands without interaction

SingleKey mode is restored.  The only way to permanently leave
this mode is by typing <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>C-x s</kbd>.
</p>
<a name="index-SingleKey-keymap-name"></a>
<p>If <small>GDB</small> was built with Readline 8.0 or later, the TUI

<p>The TUI itself does not directly support copying/pasting with the
mouse.  However, on Unix terminals, you can typically press and hold
the <tt>SHIFT</tt> key on your keyboard to temporarily bypass
<small>GDB</small>’s TUI and access the terminal’s native mouse copy/paste
functionality (commonly, click-drag-release or double-click to select
text, middle-click to paste).  This copy/paste works with the
terminal’s selection buffer, as opposed to the TUI’s buffer.

<p>The TUI has specific commands to control the text windows.
These commands are always available, even when <small>GDB</small> is not in
the TUI mode.  When <small>GDB</small> is in the standard mode, most
of these commands will automatically switch to the TUI mode.
</p>
<p>Note that if <small>GDB</small>’s <code>stdout</code> is not connected to a
terminal, or <small>GDB</small> has been started with the machine interface
interpreter (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI">The <small>GDB/MI</small> Interface</a>), most of
these commands will fail with an error, because it would not be
possible or desirable to enable curses window management.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>tui enable</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-tui-enable"></a>
<p>Activate TUI mode.  The last active TUI window layout will be used if
TUI mode has previously been used in the current debugging session,
otherwise a default layout is used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tui disable</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-tui-disable"></a>
<p>Disable TUI mode, returning to the console interpreter.
</p>
<a name="info_005fwin_005fcommand"></a></dd>
<dt><code>info win</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-info-win"></a>
<p>List the names and sizes of all currently displayed windows.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tui new-layout <var>name</var> <var>window</var> <var>weight</var> <span>[</span><var>window</var> <var>weight</var>…<span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-tui-new_002dlayout"></a>
<p>Create a new TUI layout.  The new layout will be named <var>name</var>, and
can be accessed using the <code>layout</code> command (see below).
</p>
<p>Each <var>window</var> parameter is either the name of a window to display,
or a window description.  The windows will be displayed from top to
bottom in the order listed.
</p>
<p>The names of the windows are the same as the ones given to the
<code>focus</code> command (see below); additional, the <code>status</code>
window can be specified.  Note that, because it is of fixed height,
the weight assigned to the status window is of no importance.  It is
conventional to use ‘<samp>0</samp>’ here.
</p>
<p>A window description looks a bit like an invocation of <code>tui
new-layout</code>, and is of the form
{<span>[</span><code>-horizontal</code><span>]</span><var>window</var> <var>weight</var> <span>[</span><var>window</var> <var>weight</var>…<span>]</span>}.
</p>
<p>This specifies a sub-layout.  If <code>-horizontal</code> is given, the
windows in this description will be arranged side-by-side, rather than
top-to-bottom.
</p>
<p>Each <var>weight</var> is an integer.  It is the weight of this window
relative to all the other windows in the layout.  These numbers are
used to calculate how much of the screen is given to each window.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) tui new-layout example src 1 regs 1 status 0 cmd 1
</pre></div>

<p>Here, the new layout is called ‘<samp>example</samp>’.  It shows the source
and register windows, followed by the status window, and then finally
the command window.  The non-status windows all have the same weight,
so the terminal will be split into three roughly equal sections.
</p>
<p>Here is a more complex example, showing a horizontal layout:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) tui new-layout example {-horizontal src 1 asm 1} 2 status 0 cmd 1
</pre></div>

<p>This will result in side-by-side source and assembly windows; with the
status and command window being beneath these, filling the entire
width of the terminal.  Because they have weight 2, the source and
assembly windows will be twice the height of the command window.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>layout <var>name</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-layout"></a>
<p>Changes which TUI windows are displayed.  The <var>name</var> parameter
controls which layout is shown.  It can be either one of the built-in
layout names, or the name of a layout defined by the user using
<code>tui new-layout</code>.
</p>
<p>The built-in layouts are as follows:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>next</code></dt>
<dd><p>Display the next layout.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>prev</code></dt>
<dd><p>Display the previous layout.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>src</code></dt>
<dd><p>Display the source and command windows.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>asm</code></dt>
<dd><p>Display the assembly and command windows.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>split</code></dt>
<dd><p>Display the source, assembly, and command windows.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>regs</code></dt>
<dd><p>When in <code>src</code> layout display the register, source, and command
windows.  When in <code>asm</code> or <code>split</code> layout display the
register, assembler, and command windows.

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tui reg <var>group</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-tui-reg"></a>
<p>Changes the register group displayed in the tui register window to
<var>group</var>.  If the register window is not currently displayed this
command will cause the register window to be displayed.  The list of
register groups, as well as their order is target specific. The
following groups are available on most targets:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>next</code></dt>
<dd><p>Repeatedly selecting this group will cause the display to cycle
through all of the available register groups.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>prev</code></dt>
<dd><p>Repeatedly selecting this group will cause the display to cycle
through all of the available register groups in the reverse order to

<p>Change the height of the window <var>name</var> by <var>count</var> lines.
Positive counts increase the height, while negative counts decrease
it.  The <var>name</var> parameter can be the name of any currently visible
window.  The names of the currently visible windows can be discovered
using <kbd>info win</kbd> (see <a href="#info_005fwin_005fcommand">info win</a>).

<h3>25.6 TUI Configuration Variables</h3>
<a name="index-TUI-configuration-variables"></a>

<p>Several configuration variables control the appearance of TUI windows.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>set tui border-kind <var>kind</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-tui-border_002dkind"></a>

</dd>
<dt><code>set tui tab-width <var>nchars</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-tui-tab_002dwidth"></a>
<a name="index-tabset"></a>
<p>Set the width of tab stops to be <var>nchars</var> characters.  This
setting affects the display of TAB characters in the source and
assembly windows.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>set tui compact-source <span>[</span>on<span>|</span>off<span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-set-tui-compact_002dsource"></a>
<p>Set whether the TUI source window is displayed in “compact” form.
The default display uses more space for line numbers and starts the
source text at the next tab stop; the compact display uses only as
much space as is needed for the line numbers in the current file, and
only a single space to separate the line numbers from the source.

<a name="Emacs"></a>

<a name="Using-GDB-under-GNU-Emacs"></a>
<h2>26 Using <small>GDB</small> under <small>GNU</small> Emacs</h2>

<a name="index-Emacs"></a>
<a name="index-GNU-Emacs"></a>
<p>A special interface allows you to use <small>GNU</small> Emacs to view (and
edit) the source files for the program you are debugging with
<small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>To use this interface, use the command <kbd>M-x gdb</kbd> in Emacs.  Give the
executable file you want to debug as an argument.  This command starts
<small>GDB</small> as a subprocess of Emacs, with input and output through a newly
created Emacs buffer.
</p>
<p>Running <small>GDB</small> under Emacs can be just like running <small>GDB</small> normally except for two
things:
</p>
<ul>
<li> All “terminal” input and output goes through an Emacs buffer, called
the GUD buffer.

<p>This applies both to <small>GDB</small> commands and their output, and to the input
and output done by the program you are debugging.
</p>
<p>This is useful because it means that you can copy the text of previous
commands and input them again; you can even use parts of the output
in this way.
</p>
<p>All the facilities of Emacs’ Shell mode are available for interacting
with your program.  In particular, you can send signals the usual
way—for example, <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> for an interrupt, <kbd>C-c C-z</kbd> for a
stop.
</p>
</li><li> <small>GDB</small> displays source code through Emacs.

<p>Each time <small>GDB</small> displays a stack frame, Emacs automatically finds the
source file for that frame and puts an arrow (‘<samp>=&gt;</samp>’) at the
left margin of the current line.  Emacs uses a separate buffer for
source display, and splits the screen to show both your <small>GDB</small> session
and the source.
</p>
<p>Explicit <small>GDB</small> <code>list</code> or search commands still produce output as
usual, but you probably have no reason to use them from Emacs.
</p></li></ul>

<p>We call this <em>text command mode</em>.  Emacs 22.1, and later, also uses
a graphical mode, enabled by default, which provides further buffers
that can control the execution and describe the state of your program.
See <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/Emacs.html#GDB-Graphical-Interface">GDB Graphical Interface</a> in <cite>The <small>GNU</small> Emacs Manual</cite>.
</p>
<p>If you specify an absolute file name when prompted for the <kbd>M-x
gdb</kbd> argument, then Emacs sets your current working directory to where
your program resides.  If you only specify the file name, then Emacs
sets your current working directory to the directory associated
with the previous buffer.  In this case, <small>GDB</small> may find your
program by searching your environment’s <code>PATH</code> variable, but on
some operating systems it might not find the source.  So, although the
<small>GDB</small> input and output session proceeds normally, the auxiliary
buffer does not display the current source and line of execution.
</p>
<p>The initial working directory of <small>GDB</small> is printed on the top
line of the GUD buffer and this serves as a default for the commands
that specify files for <small>GDB</small> to operate on.  See <a href="#Files">Commands to Specify Files</a>.
</p>
<p>By default, <kbd>M-x gdb</kbd> calls the program called <samp>gdb</samp>.  If you
need to call <small>GDB</small> by a different name (for example, if you
keep several configurations around, with different names) you can
customize the Emacs variable <code>gud-gdb-command-name</code> to run the
one you want.
</p>
<p>In the GUD buffer, you can use these special Emacs commands in
addition to the standard Shell mode commands:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><kbd>C-h m</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Describe the features of Emacs’ GUD Mode.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-s</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Execute to another source line, like the <small>GDB</small> <code>step</code> command; also
update the display window to show the current file and location.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-n</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Execute to next source line in this function, skipping all function
calls, like the <small>GDB</small> <code>next</code> command.  Then update the display window
to show the current file and location.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-i</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Execute one instruction, like the <small>GDB</small> <code>stepi</code> command; update
display window accordingly.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-f</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Execute until exit from the selected stack frame, like the <small>GDB</small>
<code>finish</code> command.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-c C-r</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Continue execution of your program, like the <small>GDB</small> <code>continue</code>
command.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-c &lt;</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Go up the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument
(see <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/Emacs.html#Arguments">Numeric Arguments</a> in <cite>The <small>GNU</small> Emacs Manual</cite>),
like the <small>GDB</small> <code>up</code> command.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-c &gt;</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Go down the number of frames indicated by the numeric argument, like the
<small>GDB</small> <code>down</code> command.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>In any source file, the Emacs command <kbd>C-x <span>SPC</span></kbd> (<code>gud-break</code>)
tells <small>GDB</small> to set a breakpoint on the source line point is on.
</p>
<p>In text command mode, if you type <kbd>M-x speedbar</kbd>, Emacs displays a
separate frame which shows a backtrace when the GUD buffer is current.
Move point to any frame in the stack and type <tt>RET</tt> to make it
become the current frame and display the associated source in the
source buffer.  Alternatively, click <kbd>Mouse-2</kbd> to make the
selected frame become the current one.  In graphical mode, the
speedbar displays watch expressions.
</p>
<p>If you accidentally delete the source-display buffer, an easy way to get
it back is to type the command <code>f</code> in the <small>GDB</small> buffer, to
request a frame display; when you run under Emacs, this recreates
the source buffer if necessary to show you the context of the current
frame.
</p>
<p>The source files displayed in Emacs are in ordinary Emacs buffers
which are visiting the source files in the usual way.  You can edit
the files with these buffers if you wish; but keep in mind that <small>GDB</small>
communicates with Emacs in terms of line numbers.  If you add or
delete lines from the text, the line numbers that <small>GDB</small> knows cease
to correspond properly with the code.
</p>
<p>A more detailed description of Emacs’ interaction with <small>GDB</small> is
given in the Emacs manual (see <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/Emacs.html#Debuggers">Debuggers</a> in <cite>The <small>GNU</small>
Emacs Manual</cite>).

<h2>27 The <small>GDB/MI</small> Interface</h2>



<a name="Function-and-Purpose"></a>
<h3>Function and Purpose</h3>

<a name="index-GDB_002fMI_002c-its-purpose"></a>
<p><small>GDB/MI</small> is a line based machine oriented text interface to
<small>GDB</small> and is activated by specifying using the
<samp>--interpreter</samp> command line option (see <a href="#Mode-Options">Mode Options</a>).  It
is specifically intended to support the development of systems which
use the debugger as just one small component of a larger system.
</p>
<p>This chapter is a specification of the <small>GDB/MI</small> interface.  It is written
in the form of a reference manual.
</p>
<p>Note that <small>GDB/MI</small> is still under construction, so some of the
features described below are incomplete and subject to change
(see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Development-and-Front-Ends"><small>GDB/MI</small> Development and Front Ends</a>).

<p>This chapter uses the following notation:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>|</code> separates two alternatives.

<a name="GDB_002fMI-General-Design-1"></a>
<h3>27.1 <small>GDB/MI</small> General Design</h3>
<a name="index-GDB_002fMI-General-Design"></a>

<p>Interaction of a <small>GDB/MI</small> frontend with <small>GDB</small> involves three
parts—commands sent to <small>GDB</small>, responses to those commands
and notifications.  Each command results in exactly one response,
indicating either successful completion of the command, or an error.
For the commands that do not resume the target, the response contains the
requested information.  For the commands that resume the target, the
response only indicates whether the target was successfully resumed.
Notifications is the mechanism for reporting changes in the state of the
target, or in <small>GDB</small> state, that cannot conveniently be associated with
a command and reported as part of that command response.
</p>
<p>The important examples of notifications are:
</p><ul>
<li> Exec notifications.  These are used to report changes in
target state—when a target is resumed, or stopped.  It would not
be feasible to include this information in response of resuming
commands, because one resume commands can result in multiple events in
different threads.  Also, quite some time may pass before any event
happens in the target, while a frontend needs to know whether the resuming
command itself was successfully executed.

</li><li> Console output, and status notifications.  Console output
notifications are used to report output of CLI commands, as well as
diagnostics for other commands.  Status notifications are used to
report the progress of a long-running operation.  Naturally, including
this information in command response would mean no output is produced
until the command is finished, which is undesirable.

</li><li> General notifications.  Commands may have various side effects on
the <small>GDB</small> or target state beyond their official purpose.  For example,
a command may change the selected thread.  Although such changes can
be included in command response, using notification allows for more
orthogonal frontend design.

</li></ul>

<p>There’s no guarantee that whenever an MI command reports an error,
<small>GDB</small> or the target are in any specific state, and especially,
the state is not reverted to the state before the MI command was
processed.  Therefore, whenever an MI command results in an error, 
we recommend that the frontend refreshes all the information shown in 
the user interface.
</p>

<a name="Context-management"></a>

<a name="Context-management-1"></a>
<h4>27.1.1 Context management</h4>

<a name="Threads-and-Frames"></a>
<h4>27.1.1.1 Threads and Frames</h4>

<p>In most cases when <small>GDB</small> accesses the target, this access is
done in context of a specific thread and frame (see <a href="#Frames">Frames</a>).
Often, even when accessing global data, the target requires that a thread
be specified.  The CLI interface maintains the selected thread and frame,
and supplies them to target on each command.  This is convenient,
because a command line user would not want to specify that information
explicitly on each command, and because user interacts with
<small>GDB</small> via a single terminal, so no confusion is possible as 
to what thread and frame are the current ones.
</p>
<p>In the case of MI, the concept of selected thread and frame is less
useful.  First, a frontend can easily remember this information
itself.  Second, a graphical frontend can have more than one window,
each one used for debugging a different thread, and the frontend might
want to access additional threads for internal purposes.  This
increases the risk that by relying on implicitly selected thread, the
frontend may be operating on a wrong one.  Therefore, each MI command
should explicitly specify which thread and frame to operate on.  To
make it possible, each MI command accepts the ‘<samp>--thread</samp>’ and
‘<samp>--frame</samp>’ options, the value to each is <small>GDB</small> global
identifier for thread and frame to operate on.
</p>
<p>Usually, each top-level window in a frontend allows the user to select
a thread and a frame, and remembers the user selection for further
operations.  However, in some cases <small>GDB</small> may suggest that the
current thread or frame be changed.  For example, when stopping on a
breakpoint it is reasonable to switch to the thread where breakpoint is
hit.  For another example, if the user issues the CLI ‘<samp>thread</samp>’ or
‘<samp>frame</samp>’ commands via the frontend, it is desirable to change the
frontend’s selection to the one specified by user.  <small>GDB</small>
communicates the suggestion to change current thread and frame using the
‘<samp>=thread-selected</samp>’ notification.
</p>
<p>Note that historically, MI shares the selected thread with CLI, so 
frontends used the <code>-thread-select</code> to execute commands in the
right context.  However, getting this to work right is cumbersome.  The
simplest way is for frontend to emit <code>-thread-select</code> command
before every command.  This doubles the number of commands that need
to be sent.  The alternative approach is to suppress <code>-thread-select</code>
if the selected thread in <small>GDB</small> is supposed to be identical to the
thread the frontend wants to operate on.  However, getting this
optimization right can be tricky.  In particular, if the frontend
sends several commands to <small>GDB</small>, and one of the commands changes the
selected thread, then the behaviour of subsequent commands will
change.  So, a frontend should either wait for response from such
problematic commands, or explicitly add <code>-thread-select</code> for
all subsequent commands.  No frontend is known to do this exactly
right, so it is suggested to just always pass the ‘<samp>--thread</samp>’ and
‘<samp>--frame</samp>’ options.
</p>
<a name="Language"></a>
<h4>27.1.1.2 Language</h4>

<p>The execution of several commands depends on which language is selected.
By default, the current language (see <a href="#show-language">show language</a>) is used.
But for commands known to be language-sensitive, it is recommended
to use the ‘<samp>--language</samp>’ option.  This option takes one argument,
which is the name of the language to use while executing the command.
For instance:
</p>
<div>
<pre>-data-evaluate-expression --language c &#34;sizeof (void*)&#34;
^done,value=&#34;4&#34;

<h4>27.1.2 Asynchronous command execution and non-stop mode</h4>

<p>On some targets, <small>GDB</small> is capable of processing MI commands
even while the target is running.  This is called <em>asynchronous
command execution</em> (see <a href="#Background-Execution">Background Execution</a>).  The frontend may
specify a preference for asynchronous execution using the
<code>-gdb-set mi-async 1</code> command, which should be emitted before
either running the executable or attaching to the target.  After the
frontend has started the executable or attached to the target, it can
find if asynchronous execution is enabled using the
<code>-list-target-features</code> command.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><code>-gdb-set mi-async <span>[</span>on<span>|</span>off<span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Set whether MI is in asynchronous mode.
</p>
<p>When <code>off</code>, which is the default, MI execution commands (e.g.,
<code>-exec-continue</code>) are foreground commands, and <small>GDB</small> waits
for the program to stop before processing further commands.
</p>
<p>When <code>on</code>, MI execution commands are background execution
commands (e.g., <code>-exec-continue</code> becomes the equivalent of the
<code>c&amp;</code> CLI command), and so <small>GDB</small> is capable of processing
MI commands even while the target is running.
</p>
<a name="index-show-mi_002dasync"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-gdb-show mi-async</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show whether MI asynchronous mode is enabled.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Note: In <small>GDB</small> version 7.7 and earlier, this option was called
<code>target-async</code> instead of <code>mi-async</code>, and it had the effect
of both putting MI in asynchronous mode and making CLI background
commands possible.  CLI background commands are now always possible
“out of the box” if the target supports them.  The old spelling is
kept as a deprecated alias for backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>Even if <small>GDB</small> can accept a command while target is running,
many commands that access the target do not work when the target is
running.  Therefore, asynchronous command execution is most useful
when combined with non-stop mode (see <a href="#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>).  Then,
it is possible to examine the state of one thread, while other threads
are running.
</p>
<p>When a given thread is running, MI commands that try to access the
target in the context of that thread may not work, or may work only on
some targets.  In particular, commands that try to operate on thread’s
stack will not work, on any target.  Commands that read memory, or
modify breakpoints, may work or not work, depending on the target.  Note
that even commands that operate on global state, such as <code>print</code>,
<code>set</code>, and breakpoint commands, still access the target in the
context of a specific thread,  so frontend should try to find a
stopped thread and perform the operation on that thread (using the
‘<samp>--thread</samp>’ option).
</p>
<p>Which commands will work in the context of a running thread is
highly target dependent.  However, the two commands
<code>-exec-interrupt</code>, to stop a thread, and <code>-thread-info</code>,
to find the state of a thread, will always work.

<h4>27.1.3 Thread groups</h4>
<p><small>GDB</small> may be used to debug several processes at the same time.
On some platforms, <small>GDB</small> may support debugging of several
hardware systems, each one having several cores with several different
processes running on each core.  This section describes the MI
mechanism to support such debugging scenarios.
</p>
<p>The key observation is that regardless of the structure of the 
target, MI can have a global list of threads, because most commands that 
accept the ‘<samp>--thread</samp>’ option do not need to know what process that
thread belongs to.  Therefore, it is not necessary to introduce
neither additional ‘<samp>--process</samp>’ option, nor an notion of the
current process in the MI interface.  The only strictly new feature
that is required is the ability to find how the threads are grouped
into processes.
</p>
<p>To allow the user to discover such grouping, and to support arbitrary
hierarchy of machines/cores/processes, MI introduces the concept of a
<em>thread group</em>.  Thread group is a collection of threads and other
thread groups.  A thread group always has a string identifier, a type,
and may have additional attributes specific to the type.  A new
command, <code>-list-thread-groups</code>, returns the list of top-level
thread groups, which correspond to processes that <small>GDB</small> is
debugging at the moment.  By passing an identifier of a thread group
to the <code>-list-thread-groups</code> command, it is possible to obtain
the members of specific thread group.
</p>
<p>To allow the user to easily discover processes, and other objects, he
wishes to debug, a concept of <em>available thread group</em> is
introduced.  Available thread group is an thread group that
<small>GDB</small> is not debugging, but that can be attached to, using the
<code>-target-attach</code> command.  The list of available top-level thread
groups can be obtained using ‘<samp>-list-thread-groups --available</samp>’.
In general, the content of a thread group may be only retrieved only
after attaching to that thread group.
</p>
<p>Thread groups are related to inferiors (see <a href="#Inferiors-Connections-and-Programs">Inferiors Connections and Programs</a>).  Each inferior corresponds to a thread group of a special
type ‘<samp>process</samp>’, and some additional operations are permitted on
such thread groups.

<h3>27.3 <small>GDB/MI</small> Compatibility with CLI</h3>

<a name="index-compatibility_002c-GDB_002fMI-and-CLI"></a>
<a name="index-GDB_002fMI_002c-compatibility-with-CLI"></a>

<p>For the developers convenience CLI commands can be entered directly,
but there may be some unexpected behaviour.  For example, commands
that query the user will behave as if the user replied yes, breakpoint
command lists are not executed and some CLI commands, such as
<code>if</code>, <code>when</code> and <code>define</code>, prompt for further input with
‘<samp>&gt;</samp>’, which is not valid MI output.
</p>
<p>This feature may be removed at some stage in the future and it is
recommended that front ends use the <code>-interpreter-exec</code> command
(see <a href="#g_t_002dinterpreter_002dexec">-interpreter-exec</a>).

<h3>27.4 <small>GDB/MI</small> Development and Front Ends</h3>
<a name="index-GDB_002fMI-development"></a>

<p>The application which takes the MI output and presents the state of the
program being debugged to the user is called a <em>front end</em>.
</p>
<p>Since <small>GDB/MI</small> is used by a variety of front ends to <small>GDB</small>, changes
to the MI interface may break existing usage.  This section describes how the
protocol changes and how to request previous version of the protocol when it
does.
</p>
<p>Some changes in MI need not break a carefully designed front end, and
for these the MI version will remain unchanged.  The following is a
list of changes that may occur within one level, so front ends should
parse MI output in a way that can handle them:
</p>
<ul>
<li> New MI commands may be added.

</li><li> New fields may be added to the output of any MI command.

</li><li> The range of values for fields with specified values, e.g.,
<code>in_scope</code> (see <a href="#g_t_002dvar_002dupdate">-var-update</a>) may be extended.


</li></ul>

<p>If the changes are likely to break front ends, the MI version level
will be increased by one.  The new versions of the MI protocol are not compatible
with the old versions.  Old versions of MI remain available, allowing front ends
to keep using them until they are modified to use the latest MI version.
</p>
<p>Since <code>--interpreter=mi</code> always points to the latest MI version, it is
recommended that front ends request a specific version of MI when launching
<small>GDB</small> (e.g. <code>--interpreter=mi2</code>) to make sure they get an
interpreter with the MI version they expect.
</p>
<p>The following table gives a summary of the released versions of the MI
interface: the version number, the version of GDB in which it first appeared
and the breaking changes compared to the previous version.
</p>
<table>
<thead><tr><th>MI version</th><th>GDB version</th><th>Breaking changes</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td><p>1
</p></td><td><p>5.1
</p></td><td>None</td></tr>
<tr><td><p>2
</p></td><td><p>6.0
</p></td><td><ul>
<li> The <code>-environment-pwd</code>, <code>-environment-directory</code> and
<code>-environment-path</code> commands now returns values using the MI output
syntax, rather than CLI output syntax.

</li><li> <code>-var-list-children</code>’s <code>children</code> result field is now a list, rather
than a tuple.

</li><li> <code>-var-update</code>’s <code>changelist</code> result field is now a list, rather than
a tuple.
</li></ul></td></tr>
<tr><td><p>3
</p></td><td><p>9.1
</p></td><td><ul>
<li> The output of information about multi-location breakpoints has changed in the
responses to the <code>-break-insert</code> and <code>-break-info</code> commands, as well
as in the <code>=breakpoint-created</code> and <code>=breakpoint-modified</code> events.
The multiple locations are now placed in a <code>locations</code> field, whose value
is a list.
</li></ul></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>If your front end cannot yet migrate to a more recent version of the
MI protocol, you can nevertheless selectively enable specific features
available in those recent MI versions, using the following commands:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-fix-multi-location-breakpoint-output</code></dt>
<dd><p>Use the output for multi-location breakpoints which was introduced by
MI 3, even when using MI versions 2 or 1.  This command has no
effect when using MI version 3 or later.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The best way to avoid unexpected changes in MI that might break your front
end is to make your project known to <small>GDB</small> developers and
follow development on <a href="mailto:gdb@sourceware.org">gdb@sourceware.org</a> and
<a href="mailto:gdb-patches@sourceware.org">gdb-patches@sourceware.org</a>.

<a name="index-async-records-in-GDB_002fMI"></a>
<a name="index-GDB_002fMI_002c-async-records"></a>
<p><em>Async</em> records are used to notify the <small>GDB/MI</small> client of
additional changes that have occurred.  Those changes can either be a
consequence of <small>GDB/MI</small> commands (e.g., a breakpoint modified) or a result of
target activity (e.g., target stopped).
</p>
<p>The following is the list of possible async records:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>*running,thread-id=&#34;<var>thread</var>&#34;</code></dt>
<dd><p>The target is now running.  The <var>thread</var> field can be the global
thread ID of the thread that is now running, and it can be
‘<samp>all</samp>’ if all threads are running.  The frontend should assume
that no interaction with a running thread is possible after this
notification is produced.  The frontend should not assume that this
notification is output only once for any command.  <small>GDB</small> may
emit this notification several times, either for different threads,
because it cannot resume all threads together, or even for a single
thread, if the thread must be stepped though some code before letting
it run freely.

<p>The <var>id</var> field identifies the global thread ID of the thread
that directly caused the stop – for example by hitting a breakpoint.
Depending on whether all-stop
mode is in effect (see <a href="#All_002dStop-Mode">All-Stop Mode</a>), <small>GDB</small> may either
stop all threads, or only the thread that directly triggered the stop.
If all threads are stopped, the <var>stopped</var> field will have the
value of <code>&#34;all&#34;</code>.  Otherwise, the value of the <var>stopped</var>
field will be a list of thread identifiers.  Presently, this list will
always include a single thread, but frontend should be prepared to see
several threads in the list.  The <var>core</var> field reports the
processor core on which the stop event has happened.  This field may be absent
if such information is not available.

changes them.  In particular, invoking, directly or indirectly

opaque identifier of the library.  For remote debugging case,
<var>target-name</var> and <var>host-name</var> fields give the name of the

<h4>27.5.7 <small>GDB/MI</small> Ada Exception Information</h4>

<p>Whenever a <code>*stopped</code> record is emitted because the program
stopped after hitting an exception catchpoint (see <a href="#Set-Catchpoints">Set Catchpoints</a>),
<small>GDB</small> provides the name of the exception that was raised via
the <code>exception-name</code> field.  Also, for exceptions that were raised
with an exception message, <small>GDB</small> provides that message via
the <code>exception-message</code> field.

<h3>27.6 Simple Examples of <small>GDB/MI</small> Interaction</h3>
<a name="index-GDB_002fMI_002c-simple-examples"></a>

<p>This subsection presents several simple examples of interaction using
the <small>GDB/MI</small> interface.  In these examples, ‘<samp>-&gt;</samp>’ means that the
following line is passed to <small>GDB/MI</small> as input, while ‘<samp>&lt;-</samp>’ means
the output received from <small>GDB/MI</small>.
</p>
<p>Note the line breaks shown in the examples are here only for
readability, they don’t appear in the real output.

<h4>Setting a Breakpoint</h4>

<p>Setting a breakpoint generates synchronous output which contains detailed
information of the breakpoint.

<p>Please note that ‘<samp>^exit</samp>’ is printed immediately, but it might
take some time for <small>GDB</small> to actually exit.  During that time, <small>GDB</small>
performs necessary cleanups, including killing programs being debugged
or disconnecting from debug hardware, so the frontend should wait till
<small>GDB</small> exits and should only forcibly kill <small>GDB</small> if it
fails to exit in reasonable time.

<p>Create a watchpoint.  With the ‘<samp>-a</samp>’ option it will create an
<em>access</em> watchpoint, i.e., a watchpoint that triggers either on a
read from or on a write to the memory location.  With the ‘<samp>-r</samp>’
option, the watchpoint created is a <em>read</em> watchpoint, i.e., it will
trigger only when the memory location is accessed for reading.  Without
either of the options, the watchpoint created is a regular watchpoint,
i.e., it will trigger when the memory location is accessed for writing.
See <a href="#Set-Watchpoints">Setting Watchpoints</a>.

<p>Note that ‘<samp>-break-list</samp>’ will report a single list of watchpoints and
breakpoints inserted.

<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre> -ada-task-info [ <var>task-id</var> ]
</pre></div>

<p>Reports information about either a specific Ada task, if the
<var>task-id</var> parameter is present, or about all Ada tasks.
</p>
<a name="GDB-Command-28"></a>
<h4><small>GDB</small> Command</h4>

<p>The ‘<samp>info tasks</samp>’ command prints the same information
about all Ada tasks (see <a href="#Ada-Tasks">Ada Tasks</a>).
</p>
<a name="Result-4"></a>
<h4>Result</h4>

<p>The result is a table of Ada tasks.  The following columns are
defined for each Ada task:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>current</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>This field exists only for the current thread.  It has the value ‘<samp>*</samp>’.

</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>task-id</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The identifier that the target uses to refer to the Ada task.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>thread-id</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The global thread identifier of the thread corresponding to the Ada
task.
</p>
<p>This field should always exist, as Ada tasks are always implemented
on top of a thread.  But if <small>GDB</small> cannot find this corresponding
thread for any reason, the field is omitted.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>parent-id</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>This field exists only when the task was created by another task.
In this case, it provides the ID of the parent task.
</p>

<p>Interrupts the background execution of the target.  Note how the token
associated with the stop message is the one for the execution command
that has been interrupted.  The token for the interrupt itself only
appears in the ‘<samp>^done</samp>’ output.  If the user is trying to
interrupt a non-running program, an error message will be printed.
</p>
<p>Note that when asynchronous execution is enabled, this command is
asynchronous just like other execution commands.  That is, first the
‘<samp>^done</samp>’ response will be printed, and the target stop will be
reported after that using the ‘<samp>*stopped</samp>’ notification.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, only the context thread is interrupted by default.
All threads (in all inferiors) will be interrupted if the

<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre> -exec-step-instruction [--reverse]
</pre></div>

<p>Resumes the inferior which executes one machine instruction.  If the
‘<samp>--reverse</samp>’ option is specified, resumes reverse execution of the
inferior program, stopping at the previously executed instruction.
The output, once <small>GDB</small> has stopped, will vary depending on
whether we have stopped in the middle of a source line or not.  In the
former case, the address at which the program stopped will be printed
as well.

<h3>27.14 <small>GDB/MI</small> Stack Manipulation Commands</h3>

<a name="The-_002denable_002dframe_002dfilters-Command"></a>
<h4>The <code>-enable-frame-filters</code> Command</h4>
<a name="index-_002denable_002dframe_002dfilters"></a>



<p><small>GDB</small> allows Python-based frame filters to affect the output of
the MI commands relating to stack traces.  As there is no way to
implement this in a fully backward-compatible way, a front end must
request that this functionality be enabled.
</p>
<p>Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled.
</p>
<p>Note that if Python support has not been compiled into <small>GDB</small>,
this command will still succeed (and do nothing).

<a name="Synopsis-41"></a>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>



<p>Get info on the selected frame.
</p>

<h4><small>GDB</small> Command</h4>

<p>The corresponding <small>GDB</small> command is ‘<samp>info frame</samp>’ or ‘<samp>frame</samp>’
(without arguments).

</pre></div>

<p>Display a list of the arguments for the frames between <var>low-frame</var>
and <var>high-frame</var> (inclusive).  If <var>low-frame</var> and
<var>high-frame</var> are not provided, list the arguments for the whole
call stack.  If the two arguments are equal, show the single frame
at the corresponding level.  It is an error if <var>low-frame</var> is
larger than the actual number of frames.  On the other hand,
<var>high-frame</var> may be larger than the actual number of frames, in
which case only existing frames will be returned.
</p>
<p>If <var>print-values</var> is 0 or <code>--no-values</code>, print only the names of
the variables; if it is 1 or <code>--all-values</code>, print also their
values; and if it is 2 or <code>--simple-values</code>, print the name,
type and value for simple data types, and the name and type for arrays,
structures and unions.  If the option <code>--no-frame-filters</code> is
supplied, then Python frame filters will not be executed.
</p>
<p>If the <code>--skip-unavailable</code> option is specified, arguments that
are not available are not listed.  Partially available arguments
are still displayed, however.
</p>
<p>Use of this command to obtain arguments in a single frame is
deprecated in favor of the ‘<samp>-stack-list-variables</samp>’ command.

<p>If invoked without arguments, this command prints a backtrace for the

levels are between the two arguments (inclusive).  If the two arguments
are equal, it shows the single frame at the corresponding level.  It is
an error if <var>low-frame</var> is larger than the actual number of
frames.  On the other hand, <var>high-frame</var> may be larger than the
actual number of frames, in which case only existing frames will be

<h3>27.15 <small>GDB/MI</small> Variable Objects</h3>


<a name="Introduction-to-Variable-Objects"></a>
<h4>Introduction to Variable Objects</h4>

<a name="index-variable-objects-in-GDB_002fMI"></a>

<p>Variable objects are &#34;object-oriented&#34; MI interface for examining and
changing values of expressions.  Unlike some other MI interfaces that
work with expressions, variable objects are specifically designed for
simple and efficient presentation in the frontend.  A variable object
is identified by string name.  When a variable object is created, the
frontend specifies the expression for that variable object.  The
expression can be a simple variable, or it can be an arbitrary complex
expression, and can even involve CPU registers.  After creating a
variable object, the frontend can invoke other variable object
operations—for example to obtain or change the value of a variable
object, or to change display format.
</p>
<p>Variable objects have hierarchical tree structure.  Any variable object
that corresponds to a composite type, such as structure in C, has
a number of child variable objects, for example corresponding to each
element of a structure.  A child variable object can itself have 
children, recursively.  Recursion ends when we reach 
leaf variable objects, which always have built-in types.  Child variable
objects are created only by explicit request, so if a frontend 
is not interested in the children of a particular variable object, no
child will be created.
</p>
<p>For a leaf variable object it is possible to obtain its value as a
string, or set the value from a string.  String value can be also
obtained for a non-leaf variable object, but it’s generally a string
that only indicates the type of the object, and does not list its
contents.  Assignment to a non-leaf variable object is not allowed.
</p> 
<p>A frontend does not need to read the values of all variable objects each time
the program stops.  Instead, MI provides an update command that lists all
variable objects whose values has changed since the last update
operation.  This considerably reduces the amount of data that must
be transferred to the frontend.  As noted above, children variable
objects are created on demand, and only leaf variable objects have a
real value.  As result, gdb will read target memory only for leaf
variables that frontend has created.
</p>
<p>The automatic update is not always desirable.  For example, a frontend
might want to keep a value of some expression for future reference,
and never update it.  For another example,  fetching memory is
relatively slow for embedded targets, so a frontend might want
to disable automatic update for the variables that are either not
visible on the screen, or “closed”.  This is possible using so
called “frozen variable objects”.  Such variable objects are never
implicitly updated.  
</p>
<p>Variable objects can be either <em>fixed</em> or <em>floating</em>.  For the
fixed variable object, the expression is parsed when the variable
object is created, including associating identifiers to specific
variables.  The meaning of expression never changes.  For a floating
variable object the values of variables whose names appear in the
expressions are re-evaluated every time in the context of the current
frame.  Consider this example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>void do_work(...)
{
        struct work_state state;

        if (...)
           do_work(...);
}
</pre></div>

<p>If a fixed variable object for the <code>state</code> variable is created in
this function, and we enter the recursive call, the variable
object will report the value of <code>state</code> in the top-level
<code>do_work</code> invocation.  On the other hand, a floating variable
object will report the value of <code>state</code> in the current frame.
</p>
<p>If an expression specified when creating a fixed variable object
refers to a local variable, the variable object becomes bound to the
thread and frame in which the variable object is created.  When such
variable object is updated, <small>GDB</small> makes sure that the
thread/frame combination the variable object is bound to still exists,
and re-evaluates the variable object in context of that thread/frame.
</p>
<p>The following is the complete set of <small>GDB/MI</small> operations defined to
access this functionality:
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td><strong>Operation</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-enable-pretty-printing</code></td><td>enable Python-based pretty-printing</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-var-create</code></td><td>create a variable object</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-var-delete</code></td><td>delete the variable object and/or its children</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-var-set-format</code></td><td>set the display format of this variable</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-var-show-format</code></td><td>show the display format of this variable</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-var-info-num-children</code></td><td>tells how many children this object has</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>-var-list-children</code></td><td>return a list of the object’s children</td></tr>

<p>In the next subsection we describe each operation in detail and suggest
how it can be used.

<h4>Description And Use of Operations on Variable Objects</h4>

<a name="The-_002denable_002dpretty_002dprinting-Command"></a>
<h4>The <code>-enable-pretty-printing</code> Command</h4>
<a name="index-_002denable_002dpretty_002dprinting"></a>



<p><small>GDB</small> allows Python-based visualizers to affect the output of the
MI variable object commands.  However, because there was no way to
implement this in a fully backward-compatible way, a front end must
request that this functionality be enabled.
</p>
<p>Once enabled, this feature cannot be disabled.
</p>
<p>Note that if Python support has not been compiled into <small>GDB</small>,
this command will still succeed (and do nothing).
</p>
<p>This feature is currently (as of <small>GDB</small> 7.0) experimental, and
may work differently in future versions of <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<a name="The-_002dvar_002dcreate-Command"></a>
<h4>The <code>-var-create</code> Command</h4>
<a name="index-_002dvar_002dcreate"></a>

<a name="Synopsis-48"></a>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre> -var-create {<var>name</var> | &#34;-&#34;}
    {<var>frame-addr</var> | &#34;*&#34; | &#34;@&#34;} <var>expression</var>
</pre></div>

<p>This operation creates a variable object, which allows the monitoring of
a variable, the result of an expression, a memory cell or a CPU
register.
</p>
<p>The <var>name</var> parameter is the string by which the object can be
referenced.  It must be unique.  If ‘<samp>-</samp>’ is specified, the varobj
system will generate a string “varNNNNNN” automatically.  It will be
unique provided that one does not specify <var>name</var> of that format.
The command fails if a duplicate name is found.
</p>
<p>The frame under which the expression should be evaluated can be
specified by <var>frame-addr</var>.  A ‘<samp>*</samp>’ indicates that the current
frame should be used.  A ‘<samp>@</samp>’ indicates that a floating variable
object must be created.
</p>
<p><var>expression</var> is any expression valid on the current language set (must not
begin with a ‘<samp>*</samp>’), or one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> ‘<samp>*<var>addr</var></samp>’, where <var>addr</var> is the address of a memory cell

</li><li> ‘<samp>*<var>addr</var>-<var>addr</var></samp>’ — a memory address range (TBD)

</li><li> ‘<samp>$<var>regname</var></samp>’ — a CPU register name
</li></ul>

<a name="index-dynamic-varobj"></a>
<p>A varobj’s contents may be provided by a Python-based pretty-printer.  In this
case the varobj is known as a <em>dynamic varobj</em>.  Dynamic varobjs
have slightly different semantics in some cases.  If the
<code>-enable-pretty-printing</code> command is not sent, then <small>GDB</small>
will never create a dynamic varobj.  This ensures backward
compatibility for existing clients.
</p>
<a name="Result-5"></a>
<h4>Result</h4>

<p>This operation returns attributes of the newly-created varobj.  These
are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>name</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The name of the varobj.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>numchild</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The number of children of the varobj.  This number is not necessarily
reliable for a dynamic varobj.  Instead, you must examine the
‘<samp>has_more</samp>’ attribute.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>value</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The varobj’s scalar value.  For a varobj whose type is some sort of
aggregate (e.g., a <code>struct</code>), or for a dynamic varobj, this value
will not be interesting.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>type</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The varobj’s type.  This is a string representation of the type, as
would be printed by the <small>GDB</small> CLI.  If ‘<samp>print object</samp>’
(see <a href="#Print-Settings">set print object</a>) is set to <code>on</code>, the
<em>actual</em> (derived) type of the object is shown rather than the
<em>declared</em> one.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>thread-id</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>If a variable object is bound to a specific thread, then this is the
thread’s global identifier.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>has_more</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>For a dynamic varobj, this indicates whether there appear to be any
children available.  For a non-dynamic varobj, this will be 0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>dynamic</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>This attribute will be present and have the value ‘<samp>1</samp>’ if the
varobj is a dynamic varobj.  If the varobj is not a dynamic varobj,
then this attribute will not be present.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>displayhint</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>A dynamic varobj can supply a display hint to the front end.  The
value comes directly from the Python pretty-printer object’s
<code>display_hint</code> method.  See <a href="#Pretty-Printing-API">Pretty Printing API</a>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Typical output will look like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre> name=&#34;<var>name</var>&#34;,numchild=&#34;<var>N</var>&#34;,type=&#34;<var>type</var>&#34;,thread-id=&#34;<var>M</var>&#34;,
  has_more=&#34;<var>has_more</var>&#34;
</pre></div>


<a name="The-_002dvar_002ddelete-Command"></a>
<h4>The <code>-var-delete</code> Command</h4>
<a name="index-_002dvar_002ddelete"></a>

<a name="Synopsis-49"></a>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>



<p>Deletes a previously created variable object and all of its children.
With the ‘<samp>-c</samp>’ option, just deletes the children.
</p>
<p>Returns an error if the object <var>name</var> is not found.
</p>

<a name="The-_002dvar_002dset_002dformat-Command"></a>
<h4>The <code>-var-set-format</code> Command</h4>
<a name="index-_002dvar_002dset_002dformat"></a>

<a name="Synopsis-50"></a>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre> -var-set-format <var>name</var> <var>format-spec</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Sets the output format for the value of the object <var>name</var> to be
<var>format-spec</var>.
</p>
<a name="g_t_002dvar_002dset_002dformat"></a><p>The syntax for the <var>format-spec</var> is as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre> <var>format-spec</var> →
 {binary | decimal | hexadecimal | octal | natural | zero-hexadecimal}
</pre></div>

<p>The natural format is the default format choosen automatically
based on the variable type (like decimal for an <code>int</code>, hex
for pointers, etc.).
</p>
<p>The zero-hexadecimal format has a representation similar to hexadecimal
but with padding zeroes to the left of the value.  For example, a 32-bit
hexadecimal value of 0x1234 would be represented as 0x00001234 in the
zero-hexadecimal format.
</p>
<p>For a variable with children, the format is set only on the 
variable itself, and the children are not affected.  
</p>
<a name="The-_002dvar_002dshow_002dformat-Command"></a>
<h4>The <code>-var-show-format</code> Command</h4>
<a name="index-_002dvar_002dshow_002dformat"></a>

<a name="Synopsis-51"></a>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>



<p>Returns the format used to display the value of the object <var>name</var>.
</p>



<a name="The-_002dvar_002dinfo_002dnum_002dchildren-Command"></a>
<h4>The <code>-var-info-num-children</code> Command</h4>
<a name="index-_002dvar_002dinfo_002dnum_002dchildren"></a>

<a name="Synopsis-52"></a>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre> -var-info-num-children <var>name</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Returns the number of children of a variable object <var>name</var>:
</p>


<p>Note that this number is not completely reliable for a dynamic varobj.
It will return the current number of children, but more children may
be available.
</p>

<a name="The-_002dvar_002dlist_002dchildren-Command"></a>
<h4>The <code>-var-list-children</code> Command</h4>
<a name="index-_002dvar_002dlist_002dchildren"></a>

<a name="Synopsis-53"></a>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre> -var-list-children [<var>print-values</var>] <var>name</var> [<var>from</var> <var>to</var>]
</pre></div>
<a name="g_t_002dvar_002dlist_002dchildren"></a>
<p>Return a list of the children of the specified variable object and
create variable objects for them, if they do not already exist.  With
a single argument or if <var>print-values</var> has a value of 0 or
<code>--no-values</code>, print only the names of the variables; if
<var>print-values</var> is 1 or <code>--all-values</code>, also print their
values; and if it is 2 or <code>--simple-values</code> print the name and
value for simple data types and just the name for arrays, structures
and unions.
</p>
<p><var>from</var> and <var>to</var>, if specified, indicate the range of children
to report.  If <var>from</var> or <var>to</var> is less than zero, the range is
reset and all children will be reported.  Otherwise, children starting
at <var>from</var> (zero-based) and up to and excluding <var>to</var> will be
reported.
</p>
<p>If a child range is requested, it will only affect the current call to
<code>-var-list-children</code>, but not future calls to <code>-var-update</code>.
For this, you must instead use <code>-var-set-update-range</code>.  The
intent of this approach is to enable a front end to implement any
update approach it likes; for example, scrolling a view may cause the
front end to request more children with <code>-var-list-children</code>, and
then the front end could call <code>-var-set-update-range</code> with a
different range to ensure that future updates are restricted to just
the visible items.
</p>
<p>For each child the following results are returned:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><var>name</var></dt>
<dd><p>Name of the variable object created for this child.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>exp</var></dt>
<dd><p>The expression to be shown to the user by the front end to designate this child.
For example this may be the name of a structure member.
</p>
<p>For a dynamic varobj, this value cannot be used to form an
expression.  There is no way to do this at all with a dynamic varobj.
</p>
<p>For C/C<tt>++</tt> structures there are several pseudo children returned to
designate access qualifiers.  For these pseudo children <var>exp</var> is
‘<samp>public</samp>’, ‘<samp>private</samp>’, or ‘<samp>protected</samp>’.  In this case the
type and value are not present.
</p>
<p>A dynamic varobj will not report the access qualifying
pseudo-children, regardless of the language.  This information is not
available at all with a dynamic varobj.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>numchild</var></dt>
<dd><p>Number of children this child has.  For a dynamic varobj, this will be
0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>type</var></dt>
<dd><p>The type of the child.  If ‘<samp>print object</samp>’
(see <a href="#Print-Settings">set print object</a>) is set to <code>on</code>, the
<em>actual</em> (derived) type of the object is shown rather than the
<em>declared</em> one.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>value</var></dt>
<dd><p>If values were requested, this is the value.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>thread-id</var></dt>
<dd><p>If this variable object is associated with a thread, this is the
thread’s global thread id.  Otherwise this result is not present.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>frozen</var></dt>
<dd><p>If the variable object is frozen, this variable will be present with a value of 1.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>displayhint</var></dt>
<dd><p>A dynamic varobj can supply a display hint to the front end.  The
value comes directly from the Python pretty-printer object’s

<a name="Synopsis-55"></a>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre> -var-info-expression <var>name</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Returns a string that is suitable for presenting this
variable object in user interface.  The string is generally
not valid expression in the current language, and cannot be evaluated.
</p>
<p>For example, if <code>a</code> is an array, and variable object
<code>A</code> was created for <code>a</code>, then we’ll get this output:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) -var-info-expression A.1
^done,lang=&#34;C&#34;,exp=&#34;1&#34;

<p>Here, the value of <code>lang</code> is the language name, which can be
found in <a href="#Supported-Languages">Supported Languages</a>.
</p>
<p>Note that the output of the <code>-var-list-children</code> command also
includes those expressions, so the <code>-var-info-expression</code> command
is of limited use.

<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre> -var-info-path-expression <var>name</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Returns an expression that can be evaluated in the current
context and will yield the same value that a variable object has.
Compare this with the <code>-var-info-expression</code> command, which
result can be used only for UI presentation.  Typical use of
the <code>-var-info-path-expression</code> command is creating a 
watchpoint from a variable object.
</p>
<p>This command is currently not valid for children of a dynamic varobj,
and will give an error when invoked on one.
</p>
<p>For example, suppose <code>C</code> is a C<tt>++</tt> class, derived from class
<code>Base</code>, and that the <code>Base</code> class has a member called
<code>m_size</code>.  Assume a variable <code>c</code> is has the type of
<code>C</code> and a variable object <code>C</code> was created for variable

<div>
<pre> -var-evaluate-expression [-f <var>format-spec</var>] <var>name</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Evaluates the expression that is represented by the specified variable
object and returns its value as a string.  The format of the string
can be specified with the ‘<samp>-f</samp>’ option.  The possible values of 
this option are the same as for <code>-var-set-format</code> 
(see <a href="#g_t_002dvar_002dset_002dformat">-var-set-format</a>).  If the ‘<samp>-f</samp>’ option is not specified,
the current display format will be used.  The current display format 
can be changed using the <code>-var-set-format</code> command.
</p>


<p>Note that one must invoke <code>-var-list-children</code> for a variable
before the value of a child variable can be evaluated.

<pre> -var-assign <var>name</var> <var>expression</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Assigns the value of <var>expression</var> to the variable object specified
by <var>name</var>.  The object must be ‘<samp>editable</samp>’.  If the variable’s
value is altered by the assign, the variable will show up in any
subsequent <code>-var-update</code> list.

<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre> -var-update [<var>print-values</var>] {<var>name</var> | &#34;*&#34;}
</pre></div>

<p>Reevaluate the expressions corresponding to the variable object
<var>name</var> and all its direct and indirect children, and return the
list of variable objects whose values have changed; <var>name</var> must
be a root variable object.  Here, “changed” means that the result of
<code>-var-evaluate-expression</code> before and after the
<code>-var-update</code> is different.  If ‘<samp>*</samp>’ is used as the variable
object names, all existing variable objects are updated, except
for frozen ones (see <a href="#g_t_002dvar_002dset_002dfrozen">-var-set-frozen</a>).  The option
<var>print-values</var> determines whether both names and values, or just
names are printed.  The possible values of this option are the same
as for <code>-var-list-children</code> (see <a href="#g_t_002dvar_002dlist_002dchildren">-var-list-children</a>).  It is
recommended to use the ‘<samp>--all-values</samp>’ option, to reduce the
number of MI commands needed on each program stop.
</p>
<p>With the ‘<samp>*</samp>’ parameter, if a variable object is bound to a
currently running thread, it will not be updated, without any
diagnostic.
</p>
<p>If <code>-var-set-update-range</code> was previously used on a varobj, then
only the selected range of children will be reported.
</p>
<p><code>-var-update</code> reports all the changed varobjs in a tuple named
‘<samp>changelist</samp>’.
</p>
<p>Each item in the change list is itself a tuple holding:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>name</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The name of the varobj.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>value</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>If values were requested for this update, then this field will be
present and will hold the value of the varobj.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>in_scope</samp>’</dt>
<dd><a name="g_t_002dvar_002dupdate"></a><p>This field is a string which may take one of three values:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>&#34;true&#34;</code></dt>
<dd><p>The variable object’s current value is valid.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>&#34;false&#34;</code></dt>
<dd><p>The variable object does not currently hold a valid value but it may
hold one in the future if its associated expression comes back into
scope.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>&#34;invalid&#34;</code></dt>
<dd><p>The variable object no longer holds a valid value.
This can occur when the executable file being debugged has changed,
either through recompilation or by using the <small>GDB</small> <code>file</code>
command.  The front end should normally choose to delete these variable
objects.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>In the future new values may be added to this list so the front should
be prepared for this possibility.  See <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Development-and-Front-Ends"><small>GDB/MI</small> Development and Front Ends</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>type_changed</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>This is only present if the varobj is still valid.  If the type
changed, then this will be the string ‘<samp>true</samp>’; otherwise it will
be ‘<samp>false</samp>’.
</p>
<p>When a varobj’s type changes, its children are also likely to have
become incorrect.  Therefore, the varobj’s children are automatically
deleted when this attribute is ‘<samp>true</samp>’.  Also, the varobj’s update
range, when set using the <code>-var-set-update-range</code> command, is
unset.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>new_type</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>If the varobj’s type changed, then this field will be present and will
hold the new type.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>new_num_children</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>For a dynamic varobj, if the number of children changed, or if the
type changed, this will be the new number of children.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>numchild</samp>’ field in other varobj responses is generally not
valid for a dynamic varobj – it will show the number of children that
<small>GDB</small> knows about, but because dynamic varobjs lazily
instantiate their children, this will not reflect the number of
children which may be available.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>new_num_children</samp>’ attribute only reports changes to the
number of children known by <small>GDB</small>.  This is the only way to
detect whether an update has removed children (which necessarily can
only happen at the end of the update range).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>displayhint</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The display hint, if any.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>has_more</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>This is an integer value, which will be 1 if there are more children
available outside the varobj’s update range.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>dynamic</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>This attribute will be present and have the value ‘<samp>1</samp>’ if the
varobj is a dynamic varobj.  If the varobj is not a dynamic varobj,
then this attribute will not be present.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>new_children</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>If new children were added to a dynamic varobj within the selected
update range (as set by <code>-var-set-update-range</code>), then they will
be listed in this attribute.

<p>Set the frozenness flag on the variable object <var>name</var>.  The
<var>flag</var> parameter should be either ‘<samp>1</samp>’ to make the variable
frozen or ‘<samp>0</samp>’ to make it unfrozen.  If a variable object is
frozen, then neither itself, nor any of its children, are 
implicitly updated by <code>-var-update</code> of 
a parent variable or by <code>-var-update *</code>.  Only
<code>-var-update</code> of the variable itself will update its value and
values of its children.  After a variable object is unfrozen, it is
implicitly updated by all subsequent <code>-var-update</code> operations.  
Unfreezing a variable does not update it, only subsequent
<code>-var-update</code> does.

<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre> -var-set-visualizer <var>name</var> <var>visualizer</var>
</pre></div>

<p>Set a visualizer for the variable object <var>name</var>.
</p>
<p><var>visualizer</var> is the visualizer to use.  The special value
‘<samp>None</samp>’ means to disable any visualizer in use.
</p>
<p>If not ‘<samp>None</samp>’, <var>visualizer</var> must be a Python expression.
This expression must evaluate to a callable object which accepts a
single argument.  <small>GDB</small> will call this object with the value of
the varobj <var>name</var> as an argument (this is done so that the same
Python pretty-printing code can be used for both the CLI and MI).
When called, this object must return an object which conforms to the
pretty-printing interface (see <a href="#Pretty-Printing-API">Pretty Printing API</a>).
</p>
<p>The pre-defined function <code>gdb.default_visualizer</code> may be used to
select a visualizer by following the built-in process
(see <a href="#Selecting-Pretty_002dPrinters">Selecting Pretty-Printers</a>).  This is done automatically when
a varobj is created, and so ordinarily is not needed.
</p>
<p>This feature is only available if Python support is enabled.  The MI
command <code>-list-features</code> (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Support-Commands">GDB/MI Support Commands</a>)
can be used to check this.
</p>
<a name="Example-51"></a>
<h4>Example</h4>

<p>Resetting the visualizer:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb)
-var-set-visualizer V None

<p>Reselecting the default (type-based) visualizer:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb)
-var-set-visualizer V gdb.default_visualizer
^done
</pre></div>

<p>Suppose <code>SomeClass</code> is a visualizer class.  A lambda expression
can be used to instantiate this class for a varobj:

<div>
<pre>(gdb)
-var-set-visualizer V &#34;lambda val: SomeClass()&#34;
^done

<p>This command attempts to read all accessible memory regions in the
specified range.  First, all regions marked as unreadable in the memory
map (if one is defined) will be skipped.  See <a href="#Memory-Region-Attributes">Memory Region Attributes</a>.  Second, <small>GDB</small> will attempt to read the remaining
regions.  For each one, if reading full region results in an errors,
<small>GDB</small> will try to read a subset of the region.
</p>
<p>In general, every single memory unit in the region may be readable or not,
and the only way to read every readable unit is to try a read at
every address, which is not practical.   Therefore, <small>GDB</small> will
attempt to read all accessible memory units at either beginning or the end
of the region, using a binary division scheme.  This heuristic works
well for reading across a memory map boundary.  Note that if a region
has a readable range that is neither at the beginning or the end,
<small>GDB</small> will not read it.
</p>
<p>The result record (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Result-Records">GDB/MI Result Records</a>) that is output of
the command includes a field named ‘<samp>memory</samp>’ whose content is a
list of tuples.  Each tuple represent a successfully read memory block
and has the following fields:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>begin</code></dt>
<dd><p>The start address of the memory block, as hexadecimal literal.
</p>

</pre></div>

<p>This command returns the set of collected objects, register names,
trace state variable names, memory ranges and computed expressions
that have been collected at a particular trace frame.  The optional
parameters to the command affect the output format in different ways.
See the output description table below for more details.
</p>
<p>The reported names can be used in the normal manner to create
varobjs and inspect the objects themselves.  The items returned by
this command are categorized so that it is clear which is a variable,
which is a register, which is a trace state variable, which is a
memory range and which is a computed expression.
</p>
<p>For instance, if the actions were
</p><div>
<pre>collect myVar, myArray[myIndex], myObj.field, myPtr-&gt;field, myCount + 2
collect *(int*)0xaf02bef0@40
</pre></div>

<p>the object collected in its entirety would be <code>myVar</code>.  The
object <code>myArray</code> would be partially collected, because only the
element at index <code>myIndex</code> would be collected.  The remaining
objects would be computed expressions.
</p>
<p>An example output would be:

<p>Return a list containing the names and types for all global variables
taken from the debug information.  The variables are grouped by source
file, and shown with the line number on which each variable is
defined.
</p>
<p>The <code>--include-nondebug</code> option causes the output to include
data symbols from the symbol table.
</p>
<p>The options <code>--type</code> and <code>--name</code> allow the symbols returned
to be filtered based on either the name of the variable, or the type
of the variable.
</p>
<p>The option <code>--max-results</code> restricts the command to return no
more than <var>limit</var> results.  If exactly <var>limit</var> results are
returned then there might be additional results available if a higher
limit is used.

</pre></div>

<p>This command returns information about the source files <small>GDB</small>
knows about, it will output both the filename and fullname (absolute
file name) of a source file, though the fullname can be elided if this
information is not known to <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>With no arguments this command returns a list of source files.  Each
source file is represented by a tuple with the fields; <var>file</var>,
<var>fullname</var>, and <var>debug-fully-read</var>.  The <var>file</var> is the
display name for the file, while <var>fullname</var> is the absolute name
of the file.  The <var>fullname</var> field can be elided if the absolute
name of the source file can’t be computed.  The field
<var>debug-fully-read</var> will be a string, either <code>true</code> or
<code>false</code>.  When <code>true</code>, this indicates the full debug
information for the compilation unit describing this file has been
read in.  When <code>false</code>, the full debug information has not yet
been read in.  While reading in the full debug information it is
possible that <small>GDB</small> could become aware of additional source
files.
</p>
<p>The optional <var>regexp</var> can be used to filter the list of source
files returned.  The <var>regexp</var> will be matched against the full
source file name.  The matching is case-sensitive, except on operating
systems that have case-insensitive filesystem (e.g.,
MS-Windows).  ‘<samp>--</samp>’ can be used before <var>regexp</var> to prevent
<small>GDB</small> interpreting <var>regexp</var> as a command option (e.g. if
<var>regexp</var> starts with ‘<samp>-</samp>’).
</p>
<p>If <code>--dirname</code> is provided, then <var>regexp</var> is matched only
against the directory name of each source file.  If <code>--basename</code>
is provided, then <var>regexp</var> is matched against the basename of each
source file.  Only one of <code>--dirname</code> or <code>--basename</code> may be
given, and if either is given then <var>regexp</var> is required.
</p>
<p>If <code>--group-by-objfile</code> is used then the format of the results is
changed.  The results will now be a list of tuples, with each tuple
representing an object file (executable or shared library) loaded into
<small>GDB</small>.  The fields of these tuples are; <var>filename</var>,
<var>debug-info</var>, and <var>sources</var>.  The <var>filename</var> is the
absolute name of the object file, <var>debug-info</var> is a string with
one of the following values:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>none</code></dt>
<dd><p>This object file has no debug information.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>partially-read</code></dt>
<dd><p>This object file has debug information, but it is not fully read in
yet.  When it is read in later, GDB might become aware of additional
source files.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>fully-read</code></dt>
<dd><p>This object file has debug information, and this information is fully
read into GDB.  The list of source files is complete.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The <var>sources</var> is a list or tuples, with each tuple describing a
single source file with the same fields as described previously.  The
<var>sources</var> list can be empty for object files that have no debug
information.

<p>The <small>GDB</small> equivalent is ‘<samp>info sources</samp>’.
<code>gdbtk</code> has an analogous command ‘<samp>gdb_listfiles</samp>’.

<p>Returns a list of particular features that are supported by the
target.  Those features affect the permitted MI commands, but 
unlike the features reported by the <code>-list-features</code> command, the
features depend on which target GDB is using at the moment.  Whenever
a target can change, due to commands such as <code>-target-select</code>,
<code>-target-attach</code> or <code>-exec-run</code>, the list of target features
may change, and the frontend should obtain it again.

<h4>The <code>-list-thread-groups</code> Command</h4>
<a name="index-_002dlist_002dthread_002dgroups"></a>

<a name="Synopsis-108"></a>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre>-list-thread-groups [ --available ] [ --recurse 1 ] [ <var>group</var> ... ]
</pre></div>

<p>Lists thread groups (see <a href="#Thread-groups">Thread groups</a>).  When a single thread
group is passed as the argument, lists the children of that group.
When several thread group are passed, lists information about those
thread groups.  Without any parameters, lists information about all
top-level thread groups.
</p>
<p>Normally, thread groups that are being debugged are reported.
With the ‘<samp>--available</samp>’ option, <small>GDB</small> reports thread groups
available on the target.
</p>
<p>The output of this command may have either a ‘<samp>threads</samp>’ result or
a ‘<samp>groups</samp>’ result.  The ‘<samp>thread</samp>’ result has a list of tuples
as value, with each tuple describing a thread (see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-Thread-Information">GDB/MI Thread Information</a>).  The ‘<samp>groups</samp>’ result has a list of tuples as value,
each tuple describing a thread group.  If top-level groups are
requested (that is, no parameter is passed), or when several groups
are passed, the output always has a ‘<samp>groups</samp>’ result.  The format
of the ‘<samp>group</samp>’ result is described below.
</p>
<p>To reduce the number of roundtrips it’s possible to list thread groups
together with their children, by passing the ‘<samp>--recurse</samp>’ option
and the recursion depth.  Presently, only recursion depth of 1 is
permitted.  If this option is present, then every reported thread group
will also include its children, either as ‘<samp>group</samp>’ or
‘<samp>threads</samp>’ field.
</p>
<p>In general, any combination of option and parameters is permitted, with
the following caveats:
</p>
<ul>
<li> When a single thread group is passed, the output will typically
be the ‘<samp>threads</samp>’ result.  Because threads may not contain
anything, the ‘<samp>recurse</samp>’ option will be ignored.

</li><li> When the ‘<samp>--available</samp>’ option is passed, limited information may
be available.  In particular, the list of threads of a process might
be inaccessible.  Further, specifying specific thread groups might
not give any performance advantage over listing all thread groups.
The frontend should assume that ‘<samp>-list-thread-groups --available</samp>’
is always an expensive operation and cache the results.

</li></ul>

<p>The ‘<samp>groups</samp>’ result is a list of tuples, where each tuple may
have the following fields:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>id</code></dt>
<dd><p>Identifier of the thread group.  This field is always present.
The identifier is an opaque string; frontends should not try to
convert it to an integer, even though it might look like one.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>type</code></dt>
<dd><p>The type of the thread group.  At present, only ‘<samp>process</samp>’ is a
valid type.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>pid</code></dt>
<dd><p>The target-specific process identifier.  This field is only present
for thread groups of type ‘<samp>process</samp>’ and only if the process exists.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>exit-code</code></dt>
<dd><p>The exit code of this group’s last exited thread, formatted in octal.
This field is only present for thread groups of type ‘<samp>process</samp>’ and
only if the process is not running.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>num_children</code></dt>
<dd><p>The number of children this thread group has.  This field may be
absent for an available thread group.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>threads</code></dt>
<dd><p>This field has a list of tuples as value, each tuple describing a
thread.  It may be present if the ‘<samp>--recurse</samp>’ option is
specified, and it’s actually possible to obtain the threads.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cores</code></dt>
<dd><p>This field is a list of integers, each identifying a core that one
thread of the group is running on.  This field may be absent if
such information is not available.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>executable</code></dt>
<dd><p>The name of the executable file that corresponds to this thread group.
The field is only present for thread groups of type ‘<samp>process</samp>’,
and only if there is a corresponding executable file.
</p>
</dd>

<a name="Synopsis-110"></a>
<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<div>
<pre>-add-inferior [ --no-connection ]
</pre></div>

<p>Creates a new inferior (see <a href="#Inferiors-Connections-and-Programs">Inferiors Connections and Programs</a>).  The created
inferior is not associated with any executable.  Such association may
be established with the ‘<samp>-file-exec-and-symbols</samp>’ command
(see <a href="#GDB_002fMI-File-Commands">GDB/MI File Commands</a>).
</p>
<p>By default, the new inferior begins connected to the same target
connection as the current inferior.  For example, if the current
inferior was connected to <code>gdbserver</code> with <code>target remote</code>,
then the new inferior will be connected to the same <code>gdbserver</code>
instance.  The ‘<samp>--no-connection</samp>’ option starts the new inferior
with no connection yet.  You can then for example use the
<code>-target-select remote</code> command to connect to some other
<code>gdbserver</code> instance, use <code>-exec-run</code> to spawn a local
program, etc.
</p>
<p>The command response always has a field, <var>inferior</var>, whose value
is the identifier of the thread group corresponding to the new
inferior.
</p>
<p>An additional section field, <var>connection</var>, is optional.  This
field will only exist if the new inferior has a target connection.  If
this field exists, then its value will be a tuple containing the
following fields:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>number</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The number of the connection used for the new inferior.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>name</samp>’</dt>

<h2>28 <small>GDB</small> Annotations</h2>

<p>This chapter describes annotations in <small>GDB</small>.  Annotations were
designed to interface <small>GDB</small> to graphical user interfaces or other
similar programs which want to interact with <small>GDB</small> at a
relatively high level.
</p>
<p>The annotation mechanism has largely been superseded by <small>GDB/MI</small>
(see <a href="#GDB_002fMI">GDB/MI</a>).
</p>



<hr/>
<a name="Annotations-Overview"></a>

<a name="What-is-an-Annotation_003f"></a>
<h3>28.1 What is an Annotation?</h3>
<a name="index-annotations"></a>

<p>Annotations start with a newline character, two ‘<samp>control-z</samp>’
characters, and the name of the annotation.  If there is no additional
information associated with this annotation, the name of the annotation
is followed immediately by a newline.  If there is additional
information, the name of the annotation is followed by a space, the
additional information, and a newline.  The additional information
cannot contain newline characters.
</p>
<p>Any output not beginning with a newline and two ‘<samp>control-z</samp>’
characters denotes literal output from <small>GDB</small>.  Currently there is
no need for <small>GDB</small> to output a newline followed by two
‘<samp>control-z</samp>’ characters, but if there was such a need, the
annotations could be extended with an ‘<samp>escape</samp>’ annotation which
means those three characters as output.
</p>
<p>The annotation <var>level</var>, which is specified using the
<samp>--annotate</samp> command line option (see <a href="#Mode-Options">Mode Options</a>), controls
how much information <small>GDB</small> prints together with its prompt,
values of expressions, source lines, and other types of output.  Level 0
is for no annotations, level 1 is for use when <small>GDB</small> is run as a
subprocess of <small>GNU</small> Emacs, level 3 is the maximum annotation suitable
for programs that control <small>GDB</small>, and level 2 annotations have
been made obsolete (see <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/annotate.html#Limitations">Limitations of the Annotation
Interface</a> in <cite>GDB’s Obsolete Annotations</cite>).
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-annotate"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set annotate <var>level</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The <small>GDB</small> command <code>set annotate</code> sets the level of
annotations to the specified <var>level</var>.
</p>

<dt><code>show annotate</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show-annotate"></a>

<p>This chapter describes level 3 annotations.

<p>A simple example of starting up <small>GDB</small> with annotations is:

</pre></div>

<p>Here ‘<samp>quit</samp>’ is input to <small>GDB</small>; the rest is output from
<small>GDB</small>.  The three lines beginning ‘<samp>^Z^Z</samp>’ (where ‘<samp>^Z</samp>’
denotes a ‘<samp>control-z</samp>’ character) are annotations; the rest is
output from <small>GDB</small>.

<a name="Server-Prefix"></a>

<a name="The-Server-Prefix"></a>
<h3>28.2 The Server Prefix</h3>
<a name="index-server-prefix"></a>

<p>If you prefix a command with ‘<samp>server </samp>’ then it will not affect
the command history, nor will it affect <small>GDB</small>’s notion of which
command to repeat if <tt>RET</tt> is pressed on a line by itself.  This
means that commands can be run behind a user’s back by a front-end in
a transparent manner.
</p>
<p>The <code>server </code> prefix does not affect the recording of values into
the value history; to print a value without recording it into the
value history, use the <code>output</code> command instead of the
<code>print</code> command.
</p>
<p>Using this prefix also disables confirmation requests
(see <a href="#confirmation-requests">confirmation requests</a>).

<h3>28.3 Annotation for <small>GDB</small> Input</h3>

<a name="index-annotations-for-prompts"></a>
<p>When <small>GDB</small> prompts for input, it annotates this fact so it is possible
to know when to send output, when the output from a given command is
over, etc.
</p>
<p>Different kinds of input each have a different <em>input type</em>.  Each
input type has three annotations: a <code>pre-</code> annotation, which
denotes the beginning of any prompt which is being output, a plain
annotation, which denotes the end of the prompt, and then a <code>post-</code>
annotation which denotes the end of any echo which may (or may not) be
associated with the input.  For example, the <code>prompt</code> input type
features the following annotations:
</p>
<div>
<pre>^Z^Zpre-prompt
^Z^Zprompt
^Z^Zpost-prompt
</pre></div>

<p>The input types are
</p>

expect this to work well; instead use <code>set height 0</code> to disable
prompting.  This is because the counting of lines is buggy in the
presence of annotations.

<p>This annotation occurs right before <small>GDB</small> responds to an error.

<p>Quit and error annotations indicate that any annotations which <small>GDB</small> was
in the middle of may end abruptly.  For example, if a
<code>value-history-begin</code> annotation is followed by a <code>error</code>, one
cannot expect to receive the matching <code>value-history-end</code>.  One
cannot expect not to receive it either, however; an error annotation
does not necessarily mean that <small>GDB</small> is immediately returning all the way
to the top level.

<h2>29 JIT Compilation Interface</h2>
<a name="index-just_002din_002dtime-compilation"></a>
<a name="index-JIT-compilation-interface"></a>

<p>This chapter documents <small>GDB</small>’s <em>just-in-time</em> (JIT) compilation
interface.  A JIT compiler is a program or library that generates native
executable code at runtime and executes it, usually in order to achieve good
performance while maintaining platform independence. 
</p>
<p>Programs that use JIT compilation are normally difficult to debug because
portions of their code are generated at runtime, instead of being loaded from
object files, which is where <small>GDB</small> normally finds the program’s symbols
and debug information.  In order to debug programs that use JIT compilation,
<small>GDB</small> has an interface that allows the program to register in-memory
symbol files with <small>GDB</small> at runtime.
</p>
<p>If you are using <small>GDB</small> to debug a program that uses this interface, then
it should work transparently so long as you have not stripped the binary.  If
you are developing a JIT compiler, then the interface is documented in the rest
of this chapter.  At this time, the only known client of this interface is the
LLVM JIT.
</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, the JIT interface mirrors the dynamic loader interface.  The
JIT compiler communicates with <small>GDB</small> by writing data into a global
variable and calling a function at a well-known symbol.  When <small>GDB</small>
attaches, it reads a linked list of symbol files from the global variable to
find existing code, and puts a breakpoint in the function so that it can find
out about additional code.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Declarations"></a>

<a name="JIT-Declarations"></a>
<h3>29.1 JIT Declarations</h3>

<p>These are the relevant struct declarations that a C program should include to
implement the interface:
</p>
<div>
<pre>typedef enum
{
  JIT_NOACTION = 0,
  JIT_REGISTER_FN,
  JIT_UNREGISTER_FN
} jit_actions_t;

struct jit_code_entry
{
  struct jit_code_entry *next_entry;
  struct jit_code_entry *prev_entry;
  const char *symfile_addr;
  uint64_t symfile_size;
};

struct jit_descriptor
{
  uint32_t version;
  /* This type should be jit_actions_t, but we use uint32_t
     to be explicit about the bitwidth.  */
  uint32_t action_flag;
  struct jit_code_entry *relevant_entry;
  struct jit_code_entry *first_entry;
};

/* GDB puts a breakpoint in this function.  */
void __attribute__((noinline)) __jit_debug_register_code() { };

/* Make sure to specify the version statically, because the
   debugger may check the version before we can set it.  */
struct jit_descriptor __jit_debug_descriptor = { 1, 0, 0, 0 };
</pre></div>

<p>If the JIT is multi-threaded, then it is important that the JIT synchronize any
modifications to this global data properly, which can easily be done by putting
a global mutex around modifications to these structures.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Registering-Code"></a>

<a name="Registering-Code-1"></a>
<h3>29.2 Registering Code</h3>

<p>To register code with <small>GDB</small>, the JIT should follow this protocol:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Generate an object file in memory with symbols and other desired debug
information.  The file must include the virtual addresses of the sections.

</li><li> Create a code entry for the file, which gives the start and size of the symbol
file.

</li><li> Add it to the linked list in the JIT descriptor.

</li><li> Point the relevant_entry field of the descriptor at the entry.

</li><li> Set <code>action_flag</code> to <code>JIT_REGISTER</code> and call
<code>__jit_debug_register_code</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>When <small>GDB</small> is attached and the breakpoint fires, <small>GDB</small> uses the
<code>relevant_entry</code> pointer so it doesn’t have to walk the list looking for
new code.  However, the linked list must still be maintained in order to allow
<small>GDB</small> to attach to a running process and still find the symbol files.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Unregistering-Code"></a>

<a name="Unregistering-Code-1"></a>
<h3>29.3 Unregistering Code</h3>

<p>If code is freed, then the JIT should use the following protocol:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Remove the code entry corresponding to the code from the linked list.

</li><li> Point the <code>relevant_entry</code> field of the descriptor at the code entry.

</li><li> Set <code>action_flag</code> to <code>JIT_UNREGISTER</code> and call
<code>__jit_debug_register_code</code>.
</li></ul>

<p>If the JIT frees or recompiles code without unregistering it, then <small>GDB</small>
and the JIT will leak the memory used for the associated symbol files.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Custom-Debug-Info"></a>

<a name="Custom-Debug-Info-1"></a>
<h3>29.4 Custom Debug Info</h3>
<a name="index-custom-JIT-debug-info"></a>
<a name="index-JIT-debug-info-reader"></a>

<p>Generating debug information in platform-native file formats (like ELF
or COFF) may be an overkill for JIT compilers; especially if all the
debug info is used for is displaying a meaningful backtrace.  The
issue can be resolved by having the JIT writers decide on a debug info
format and also provide a reader that parses the debug info generated
by the JIT compiler.  This section gives a brief overview on writing
such a parser.  More specific details can be found in the source file
<samp>gdb/jit-reader.in</samp>, which is also installed as a header at
<samp><var>includedir</var>/gdb/jit-reader.h</samp> for easy inclusion.
</p>
<p>The reader is implemented as a shared object (so this functionality is
not available on platforms which don’t allow loading shared objects at
runtime).  Two <small>GDB</small> commands, <code>jit-reader-load</code> and
<code>jit-reader-unload</code> are provided, to be used to load and unload
the readers from a preconfigured directory.  Once loaded, the shared
object is used the parse the debug information emitted by the JIT
compiler.

<h4>29.4.2 Writing JIT Debug Info Readers</h4>
<a name="index-writing-JIT-debug-info-readers"></a>

<p>As mentioned, a reader is essentially a shared object conforming to a
certain ABI.  This ABI is described in <samp>jit-reader.h</samp>.
</p>
<p><samp>jit-reader.h</samp> defines the structures, macros and functions
required to write a reader.  It is installed (along with
<small>GDB</small>), in <samp><var>includedir</var>/gdb</samp> where <var>includedir</var> is
the system include directory.
</p>
<p>Readers need to be released under a GPL compatible license.  A reader
can be declared as released under such a license by placing the macro
<code>GDB_DECLARE_GPL_COMPATIBLE_READER</code> in a source file.
</p>
<p>The entry point for readers is the symbol <code>gdb_init_reader</code>,
which is expected to be a function with the prototype
</p>
<a name="index-gdb_005finit_005freader"></a>
<div>
<pre>extern struct gdb_reader_funcs *gdb_init_reader (void);
</pre></div>

<a name="index-struct-gdb_005freader_005ffuncs"></a>

<p><code>struct gdb_reader_funcs</code> contains a set of pointers to callback
functions.  These functions are executed to read the debug info
generated by the JIT compiler (<code>read</code>), to unwind stack frames
(<code>unwind</code>) and to create canonical frame IDs
(<code>get_frame_id</code>).  It also has a callback that is called when the
reader is being unloaded (<code>destroy</code>).  The struct looks like this
</p>
<div>
<pre>struct gdb_reader_funcs
{
  /* Must be set to GDB_READER_INTERFACE_VERSION.  */
  int reader_version;

  /* For use by the reader.  */
  void *priv_data;

  gdb_read_debug_info *read;
  gdb_unwind_frame *unwind;
  gdb_get_frame_id *get_frame_id;
  gdb_destroy_reader *destroy;
};
</pre></div>

<a name="index-struct-gdb_005fsymbol_005fcallbacks"></a>
<a name="index-struct-gdb_005funwind_005fcallbacks"></a>

<p>The callbacks are provided with another set of callbacks by
<small>GDB</small> to do their job.  For <code>read</code>, these callbacks are
passed in a <code>struct gdb_symbol_callbacks</code> and for <code>unwind</code>
and <code>get_frame_id</code>, in a <code>struct gdb_unwind_callbacks</code>.
<code>struct gdb_symbol_callbacks</code> has callbacks to create new object
files and new symbol tables inside those object files.  <code>struct
gdb_unwind_callbacks</code> has callbacks to read registers off the current
frame and to write out the values of the registers in the previous
frame.  Both have a callback (<code>target_read</code>) to read bytes off the
target’s address space.

<h2>30 In-Process Agent</h2>
<a name="index-debugging-agent"></a>
<p>The traditional debugging model is conceptually low-speed, but works fine,
because most bugs can be reproduced in debugging-mode execution.  However,
as multi-core or many-core processors are becoming mainstream, and
multi-threaded programs become more and more popular, there should be more
and more bugs that only manifest themselves at normal-mode execution, for
example, thread races, because debugger’s interference with the program’s
timing may conceal the bugs.  On the other hand, in some applications,
it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt the program’s execution
long enough for the developer to learn anything helpful about its behavior.
If the program’s correctness depends on its real-time behavior, delays
introduced by a debugger might cause the program to fail, even when the
code itself is correct.  It is useful to be able to observe the program’s
behavior without interrupting it.
</p>
<p>Therefore, traditional debugging model is too intrusive to reproduce
some bugs.  In order to reduce the interference with the program, we can
reduce the number of operations performed by debugger.  The
<em>In-Process Agent</em>, a shared library, is running within the same
process with inferior, and is able to perform some debugging operations
itself.  As a result, debugger is only involved when necessary, and
performance of debugging can be improved accordingly.  Note that
interference with program can be reduced but can’t be removed completely,
because the in-process agent will still stop or slow down the program.
</p>
<p>The in-process agent can interpret and execute Agent Expressions
(see <a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>) during performing debugging operations.  The
agent expressions can be used for different purposes, such as collecting
data in tracepoints, and condition evaluation in breakpoints.
</p>
<a name="Control-Agent"></a><p>You can control whether the in-process agent is used as an aid for
debugging with the following commands:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-agent-on"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set agent on</code></dt>
<dd><p>Causes the in-process agent to perform some operations on behalf of the
debugger.  Just which operations requested by the user will be done
by the in-process agent depends on the its capabilities.  For example,
if you request to evaluate breakpoint conditions in the in-process agent,
and the in-process agent has such capability as well, then breakpoint
conditions will be evaluated in the in-process agent.
</p>
<a name="index-set-agent-off"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set agent off</code></dt>
<dd><p>Disables execution of debugging operations by the in-process agent.  All
of the operations will be performed by <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<a name="index-show-agent"></a>

<a name="In_002dProcess-Agent-Protocol-1"></a>
<h3>30.1 In-Process Agent Protocol</h3>
<a name="index-in_002dprocess-agent-protocol"></a>

<p>The in-process agent is able to communicate with both <small>GDB</small> and
GDBserver (see <a href="#In_002dProcess-Agent">In-Process Agent</a>).  This section documents the protocol
used for communications between <small>GDB</small> or GDBserver and the IPA.
In general, <small>GDB</small> or GDBserver sends commands
(see <a href="#IPA-Protocol-Commands">IPA Protocol Commands</a>) and data to in-process agent, and then
in-process agent replies back with the return result of the command, or
some other information.  The data sent to in-process agent is composed
of primitive data types, such as 4-byte or 8-byte type, and composite
types, which are called objects (see <a href="#IPA-Protocol-Objects">IPA Protocol Objects</a>).
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="IPA-Protocol-Objects"></a>

<a name="IPA-Protocol-Objects-1"></a>
<h4>30.1.1 IPA Protocol Objects</h4>
<a name="index-ipa-protocol-objects"></a>

<p>The commands sent to and results received from agent may contain some
complex data types called <em>objects</em>.
</p>
<p>The in-process agent is running on the same machine with <small>GDB</small>
or GDBserver, so it doesn’t have to handle as much differences between
two ends as remote protocol (see <a href="#Remote-Protocol">Remote Protocol</a>) tries to handle.
However, there are still some differences of two ends in two processes:
</p>
<ol>
<li> word size.  On some 64-bit machines, <small>GDB</small> or GDBserver can be
compiled as a 64-bit executable, while in-process agent is a 32-bit one.
</li><li> ABI.  Some machines may have multiple types of ABI, <small>GDB</small> or
GDBserver is compiled with one, and in-process agent is compiled with
the other one.
</li></ol>

<p>Here are the IPA Protocol Objects:
</p>
<ol>
<li> agent expression object.  It represents an agent expression
(see <a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>).
<a name="agent-expression-object"></a></li><li> tracepoint action object.  It represents a tracepoint action
(see <a href="#Tracepoint-Actions">Tracepoint Action Lists</a>) to collect registers,
memory, static trace data and to evaluate expression.
<a name="tracepoint-action-object"></a></li><li> tracepoint object.  It represents a tracepoint (see <a href="#Tracepoints">Tracepoints</a>).
<a name="tracepoint-object"></a>
</li></ol>

<a name="How-to-Report-Bugs"></a>
<h3>31.2 How to Report Bugs</h3>
<a name="index-bug-reports"></a>
<a name="index-GDB-bugs_002c-reporting"></a>

<p>A number of companies and individuals offer support for <small>GNU</small> products.
If you obtained <small>GDB</small> from a support organization, we recommend you
contact that organization first.
</p>
<p>You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file <samp>etc/SERVICE</samp> in the <small>GNU</small> Emacs
distribution.
</p>
<p>In any event, we also recommend that you submit bug reports for
<small>GDB</small> to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/bugs/">https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/bugs/</a>.
</p>
<p>The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
<strong>report all the facts</strong>.  If you are not sure whether to state a
fact or leave it out, state it!
</p>
<p>Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of the variable you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug is a
stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location where that
name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were different, the contents
of that location would fool the debugger into doing the right thing despite
the bug.  Play it safe and give a specific, complete example.  That is the
easiest thing for you to do, and the most helpful.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix the
bug.  It may be that the bug has been reported previously, but neither
you nor we can know that unless your bug report is complete and
self-contained.
</p>
<p>Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, “Does this ring a
bell?”  Those bug reports are useless, and we urge everyone to
<em>refuse to respond to them</em> except to chide the sender to report
bugs properly.
</p>
<p>To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The version of <small>GDB</small>.  <small>GDB</small> announces it if you start
with no arguments; you can also print it at any time using <code>show
version</code>.

<p>Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in looking for
the bug in the current version of <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
</li><li> The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and
version number.

</li><li> The details of the <small>GDB</small> build-time configuration.
<small>GDB</small> shows these details if you invoke it with the
<samp>--configuration</samp> command-line option, or if you type
<code>show configuration</code> at <small>GDB</small>’s prompt.

</li><li> What compiler (and its version) was used to compile <small>GDB</small>—e.g.
“gcc–2.8.1”.

</li><li> What compiler (and its version) was used to compile the program you are
debugging—e.g.  “gcc–2.8.1”, or “HP92453-01 A.10.32.03 HP
C Compiler”.  For <small>GCC</small>, you can say <kbd>gcc --version</kbd>
to get this information; for other compilers, see the documentation for
those compilers.

</li><li> The command arguments you gave the compiler to compile your example and
observe the bug.  For example, did you use ‘<samp>-O</samp>’?  To guarantee
you will not omit something important, list them all.  A copy of the
Makefile (or the output from make) is sufficient.

<p>If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess wrong
and then we might not encounter the bug.
</p>
</li><li> A complete input script, and all necessary source files, that will
reproduce the bug.

</li><li> A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, “It gets a fatal signal.”

<p>Of course, if the bug is that <small>GDB</small> gets a fatal signal, then we
will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we might
not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well not give us
a chance to make a mistake.
</p>
<p>Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still
say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on, such as, your
copy of <small>GDB</small> is out of synch, or you have encountered a bug in
the C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your copy might
crash and ours would not.  If you told us to expect a crash, then when
ours fails to crash, we would know that the bug was not happening for
us.  If you had not told us to expect a crash, then we would not be able
to draw any conclusion from our observations.
</p>
<a name="index-script"></a>
<a name="index-recording-a-session-script"></a>
<p>To collect all this information, you can use a session recording program
such as <code>script</code>, which is available on many Unix systems.
Just run your <small>GDB</small> session inside <code>script</code> and then
include the <samp>typescript</samp> file with your bug report.
</p>
<p>Another way to record a <small>GDB</small> session is to run <small>GDB</small>
inside Emacs and then save the entire buffer to a file.
</p>
</li><li> If you wish to suggest changes to the <small>GDB</small> source, send us context
diffs.  If you even discuss something in the <small>GDB</small> source, refer to
it by context, not by line number.

<p>The line numbers in our development sources will not match those in your
sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful information to us.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Here are some things that are not necessary:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A description of the envelope of the bug.

<p>Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
changes will not affect it.
</p>
<p>This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way we
will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger
with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples.
We recommend that you save your time for something else.
</p>
<p>Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report <em>instead</em>
of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
less time, and so on.
</p>
<p>However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do this,
report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you used.
</p>
</li><li> A patch for the bug.

<p>A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not omit
the necessary information, such as the test case, on the assumption that
a patch is all we need.  We might see problems with your patch and decide
to fix the problem another way, or we might not understand it at all.
</p>
<p>Sometimes with a program as complicated as <small>GDB</small> it is very hard to
construct an example that will make the program follow a certain path
through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will not be able
to construct one, so we will not be able to verify that the bug is fixed.
</p>
<p>And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why your
patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A test case will
help us to understand.
</p>
</li><li> A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

<p>Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about such
things without first using the debugger to find the facts.
</p></li></ul>

<h2>32 Command Line Editing</h2>

<p>This chapter describes the basic features of the <small>GNU</small>
command line editing interface.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Introduction-and-Notation"></a>

<a name="Introduction-to-Line-Editing"></a>
<h3>32.1 Introduction to Line Editing</h3>

<p>The following paragraphs describe the notation used to represent
keystrokes.
</p>
<p>The text <kbd>C-k</kbd> is read as ‘Control-K’ and describes the character
produced when the <tt>k</tt> key is pressed while the Control key
is depressed.
</p>
<p>The text <kbd>M-k</kbd> is read as ‘Meta-K’ and describes the character
produced when the Meta key (if you have one) is depressed, and the <tt>k</tt>
key is pressed.
The Meta key is labeled <tt>ALT</tt> on many keyboards.
On keyboards with two keys labeled <tt>ALT</tt> (usually to either side of
the space bar), the <tt>ALT</tt> on the left side is generally set to
work as a Meta key.
The <tt>ALT</tt> key on the right may also be configured to work as a
Meta key or may be configured as some other modifier, such as a
Compose key for typing accented characters.
</p>
<p>If you do not have a Meta or <tt>ALT</tt> key, or another key working as
a Meta key, the identical keystroke can be generated by typing <tt>ESC</tt>
<em>first</em>, and then typing <tt>k</tt>.
Either process is known as <em>metafying</em> the <tt>k</tt> key.
</p>
<p>The text <kbd>M-C-k</kbd> is read as ‘Meta-Control-k’ and describes the
character produced by <em>metafying</em> <kbd>C-k</kbd>.
</p>
<p>In addition, several keys have their own names.  Specifically,
<tt>DEL</tt>, <tt>ESC</tt>, <tt>LFD</tt>, <tt>SPC</tt>, <tt>RET</tt>, and <tt>TAB</tt> all
stand for themselves when seen in this text, or in an init file
(see <a href="#Readline-Init-File">Readline Init File</a>).
If your keyboard lacks a <tt>LFD</tt> key, typing <tt>C-j</tt> will

<h3>32.2 Readline Interaction</h3>
<a name="index-interaction_002c-readline"></a>

<p>Often during an interactive session you type in a long line of text,
only to notice that the first word on the line is misspelled.  The
Readline library gives you a set of commands for manipulating the text
as you type it in, allowing you to just fix your typo, and not forcing
you to retype the majority of the line.  Using these editing commands,
you move the cursor to the place that needs correction, and delete or
insert the text of the corrections.  Then, when you are satisfied with
the line, you simply press <tt>RET</tt>.  You do not have to be at the
end of the line to press <tt>RET</tt>; the entire line is accepted
regardless of the location of the cursor within the line.

<h4>32.2.1 Readline Bare Essentials</h4>
<a name="index-notation_002c-readline"></a>
<a name="index-command-editing"></a>
<a name="index-editing-command-lines"></a>

<p>In order to enter characters into the line, simply type them.  The typed
character appears where the cursor was, and then the cursor moves one
space to the right.  If you mistype a character, you can use your
erase character to back up and delete the mistyped character.
</p>
<p>Sometimes you may mistype a character, and
not notice the error until you have typed several other characters.  In
that case, you can type <kbd>C-b</kbd> to move the cursor to the left, and then
correct your mistake.  Afterwards, you can move the cursor to the right
with <kbd>C-f</kbd>.
</p>
<p>When you add text in the middle of a line, you will notice that characters
to the right of the cursor are ‘pushed over’ to make room for the text
that you have inserted.  Likewise, when you delete text behind the cursor,
characters to the right of the cursor are ‘pulled back’ to fill in the
blank space created by the removal of the text.  A list of the bare
essentials for editing the text of an input line follows.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><kbd>C-b</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Move back one character.

</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>(Depending on your configuration, the <tt>Backspace</tt> key be set to
delete the character to the left of the cursor and the <tt>DEL</tt> key set
to delete the character underneath the cursor, like <kbd>C-d</kbd>, rather
than the character to the left of the cursor.)

<h4>32.2.2 Readline Movement Commands</h4>


<p>The above table describes the most basic keystrokes that you need
in order to do editing of the input line.  For your convenience, many
other commands have been added in addition to <kbd>C-b</kbd>, <kbd>C-f</kbd>,
<kbd>C-d</kbd>, and <tt>DEL</tt>.  Here are some commands for moving more rapidly
about the line.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><kbd>C-a</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Move to the start of the line.
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd>C-e</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Move to the end of the line.
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd>M-f</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Move forward a word, where a word is composed of letters and digits.
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd>M-b</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Move backward a word.
</p></dd>
<dt><kbd>C-l</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Clear the screen, reprinting the current line at the top.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Notice how <kbd>C-f</kbd> moves forward a character, while <kbd>M-f</kbd> moves
forward a word.  It is a loose convention that control keystrokes
operate on characters while meta keystrokes operate on words.

<h4>32.2.3 Readline Killing Commands</h4>

<a name="index-killing-text"></a>
<a name="index-yanking-text"></a>

<p><em>Killing</em> text means to delete the text from the line, but to save
it away for later use, usually by <em>yanking</em> (re-inserting)
it back into the line.
(‘Cut’ and ‘paste’ are more recent jargon for ‘kill’ and ‘yank’.)
</p>
<p>If the description for a command says that it ‘kills’ text, then you can
be sure that you can get the text back in a different (or the same)
place later.
</p>
<p>When you use a kill command, the text is saved in a <em>kill-ring</em>.
Any number of consecutive kills save all of the killed text together, so
that when you yank it back, you get it all.  The kill
ring is not line specific; the text that you killed on a previously
typed line is available to be yanked back later, when you are typing
another line.
<a name="index-kill-ring"></a>
</p>
<p>Here is the list of commands for killing text.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><kbd>C-k</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Kill the text from the current cursor position to the end of the line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-d</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Kill from the cursor to the end of the current word, or, if between
words, to the end of the next word.
Word boundaries are the same as those used by <kbd>M-f</kbd>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-<span>DEL</span></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Kill from the cursor the start of the current word, or, if between
words, to the start of the previous word.
Word boundaries are the same as those used by <kbd>M-b</kbd>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>C-w</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Kill from the cursor to the previous whitespace.  This is different than
<kbd>M-<span>DEL</span></kbd> because the word boundaries differ.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Here is how to <em>yank</em> the text back into the line.  Yanking
means to copy the most-recently-killed text from the kill buffer.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><kbd>C-y</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Yank the most recently killed text back into the buffer at the cursor.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><kbd>M-y</kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Rotate the kill-ring, and yank the new top.  You can only do this if
the prior command is <kbd>C-y</kbd> or <kbd>M-y</kbd>.
</p></dd>

<a name="Readline-Arguments"></a>

<a name="Readline-Arguments-1"></a>
<h4>32.2.4 Readline Arguments</h4>

<p>You can pass numeric arguments to Readline commands.  Sometimes the
argument acts as a repeat count, other times it is the <i>sign</i> of the
argument that is significant.  If you pass a negative argument to a
command which normally acts in a forward direction, that command will
act in a backward direction.  For example, to kill text back to the
start of the line, you might type ‘<samp>M-- C-k</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The general way to pass numeric arguments to a command is to type meta
digits before the command.  If the first ‘digit’ typed is a minus
sign (‘<samp>-</samp>’), then the sign of the argument will be negative.  Once
you have typed one meta digit to get the argument started, you can type
the remainder of the digits, and then the command.  For example, to give
the <kbd>C-d</kbd> command an argument of 10, you could type ‘<samp>M-1 0 C-d</samp>’,
which will delete the next ten characters on the input line.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Searching"></a>

<a name="Searching-for-Commands-in-the-History"></a>
<h4>32.2.5 Searching for Commands in the History</h4>

<p>Readline provides commands for searching through the command history
for lines containing a specified string.
There are two search modes:  <em>incremental</em> and <em>non-incremental</em>.
</p>
<p>Incremental searches begin before the user has finished typing the
search string.
As each character of the search string is typed, Readline displays
the next entry from the history matching the string typed so far.
An incremental search requires only as many characters as needed to
find the desired history entry.
To search backward in the history for a particular string, type
<kbd>C-r</kbd>.  Typing <kbd>C-s</kbd> searches forward through the history.
The characters present in the value of the <code>isearch-terminators</code> variable
are used to terminate an incremental search.
If that variable has not been assigned a value, the <tt>ESC</tt> and
<kbd>C-J</kbd> characters will terminate an incremental search.
<kbd>C-g</kbd> will abort an incremental search and restore the original line.
When the search is terminated, the history entry containing the
search string becomes the current line.
</p>
<p>To find other matching entries in the history list, type <kbd>C-r</kbd> or
<kbd>C-s</kbd> as appropriate.
This will search backward or forward in the history for the next
entry matching the search string typed so far.
Any other key sequence bound to a Readline command will terminate
the search and execute that command.
For instance, a <tt>RET</tt> will terminate the search and accept
the line, thereby executing the command from the history list.
A movement command will terminate the search, make the last line found
the current line, and begin editing.
</p>
<p>Readline remembers the last incremental search string.  If two
<kbd>C-r</kbd>s are typed without any intervening characters defining a new
search string, any remembered search string is used.
</p>
<p>Non-incremental searches read the entire search string before starting
to search for matching history lines.  The search string may be
typed by the user or be part of the contents of the current line.

<a name="Readline-Init-File-1"></a>
<h3>32.3 Readline Init File</h3>
<a name="index-initialization-file_002c-readline"></a>

<p>Although the Readline library comes with a set of Emacs-like
keybindings installed by default, it is possible to use a different set
of keybindings.
Any user can customize programs that use Readline by putting
commands in an <em>inputrc</em> file, conventionally in his home directory.
The name of this
file is taken from the value of the environment variable <code>INPUTRC</code>.  If
that variable is unset, the default is <samp>~/.inputrc</samp>.  If that
file does not exist or cannot be read, the ultimate default is
<samp>/etc/inputrc</samp>.
</p>
<p>When a program which uses the Readline library starts up, the
init file is read, and the key bindings are set.
</p>
<p>In addition, the <code>C-x C-r</code> command re-reads this init file, thus
incorporating any changes that you might have made to it.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Readline-Init-File-Syntax"></a>

<a name="Readline-Init-File-Syntax-1"></a>
<h4>32.3.1 Readline Init File Syntax</h4>

<p>There are only a few basic constructs allowed in the
Readline init file.  Blank lines are ignored.
Lines beginning with a ‘<samp>#</samp>’ are comments.
Lines beginning with a ‘<samp>$</samp>’ indicate conditional
constructs (see <a href="#Conditional-Init-Constructs">Conditional Init Constructs</a>).  Other lines
denote variable settings and key bindings.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>Variable Settings</dt>
<dd><p>You can modify the run-time behavior of Readline by
altering the values of variables in Readline
using the <code>set</code> command within the init file.
The syntax is simple:
</p>


<p>Here, for example, is how to
change from the default Emacs-like key binding to use
<code>vi</code> line editing commands:
</p>


<p>Variable names and values, where appropriate, are recognized without regard
to case.  Unrecognized variable names are ignored.
</p>
<p>Boolean variables (those that can be set to on or off) are set to on if
the value is null or empty, <var>on</var> (case-insensitive), or 1.  Any other
value results in the variable being set to off.
</p>

<p>A great deal of run-time behavior is changeable with the following
variables.
</p>
<a name="index-variables_002c-readline"></a>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>bell-style</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-bell_002dstyle"></a>
<p>Controls what happens when Readline wants to ring the terminal bell.
If set to ‘<samp>none</samp>’, Readline never rings the bell.  If set to
‘<samp>visible</samp>’, Readline uses a visible bell if one is available.
If set to ‘<samp>audible</samp>’ (the default), Readline attempts to ring
the terminal’s bell.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>bind-tty-special-chars</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-bind_002dtty_002dspecial_002dchars"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’ (the default), Readline attempts to bind the control
characters   treated specially by the kernel’s terminal driver to their
Readline equivalents.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>blink-matching-paren</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-blink_002dmatching_002dparen"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, Readline attempts to briefly move the cursor to an
opening parenthesis when a closing parenthesis is inserted.  The default
is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>colored-completion-prefix</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-colored_002dcompletion_002dprefix"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, when listing completions, Readline displays the
common prefix of the set of possible completions using a different color.
The color definitions are taken from the value of the <code>LS_COLORS</code>
environment variable.
The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>colored-stats</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-colored_002dstats"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, Readline displays possible completions using different
colors to indicate their file type.
The color definitions are taken from the value of the <code>LS_COLORS</code>
environment variable.
The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>comment-begin</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-comment_002dbegin"></a>
<p>The string to insert at the beginning of the line when the
<code>insert-comment</code> command is executed.  The default value
is <code>&#34;#&#34;</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>completion-display-width</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-completion_002ddisplay_002dwidth"></a>
<p>The number of screen columns used to display possible matches
when performing completion.
The value is ignored if it is less than 0 or greater than the terminal
screen width.
A value of 0 will cause matches to be displayed one per line.
The default value is -1.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>completion-ignore-case</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-completion_002dignore_002dcase"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, Readline performs filename matching and completion
in a case-insensitive fashion.
The default value is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>completion-map-case</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-completion_002dmap_002dcase"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, and <var>completion-ignore-case</var> is enabled, Readline
treats hyphens (‘<samp>-</samp>’) and underscores (‘<samp>_</samp>’) as equivalent when
performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
The default value is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>completion-prefix-display-length</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-completion_002dprefix_002ddisplay_002dlength"></a>
<p>The length in characters of the common prefix of a list of possible
completions that is displayed without modification.  When set to a
value greater than zero, common prefixes longer than this value are
replaced with an ellipsis when displaying possible completions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>completion-query-items</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-completion_002dquery_002ditems"></a>
<p>The number of possible completions that determines when the user is
asked whether the list of possibilities should be displayed.
If the number of possible completions is greater than or equal to this value,
Readline will ask whether or not the user wishes to view them;
otherwise, they are simply listed.
This variable must be set to an integer value greater than or equal to 0.
A negative value means Readline should never ask.
The default limit is <code>100</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>convert-meta</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-convert_002dmeta"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, Readline will convert characters with the
eighth bit set to an <small>ASCII</small> key sequence by stripping the eighth
bit and prefixing an <tt>ESC</tt> character, converting them to a
meta-prefixed key sequence.  The default value is ‘<samp>on</samp>’, but
will be set to ‘<samp>off</samp>’ if the locale is one that contains
eight-bit characters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>disable-completion</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-disable_002dcompletion"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>On</samp>’, Readline will inhibit word completion.
Completion  characters will be inserted into the line as if they had
been mapped to <code>self-insert</code>.  The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>echo-control-characters</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-echo_002dcontrol_002dcharacters"></a>
<p>When set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, on operating systems that indicate they support it,
readline echoes a character corresponding to a signal generated from the
keyboard.  The default is ‘<samp>on</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>editing-mode</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-editing_002dmode"></a>
<p>The <code>editing-mode</code> variable controls which default set of
key bindings is used.  By default, Readline starts up in Emacs editing
mode, where the keystrokes are most similar to Emacs.  This variable can be
set to either ‘<samp>emacs</samp>’ or ‘<samp>vi</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>emacs-mode-string</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-emacs_002dmode_002dstring"></a>
<p>If the <var>show-mode-in-prompt</var> variable is enabled,
this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary
prompt when emacs editing mode is active.  The value is expanded like a
key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and
backslash escape sequences is available.
Use the ‘<samp>\1</samp>’ and ‘<samp>\2</samp>’ escapes to begin and end sequences of
non-printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control
sequence into the mode string.
The default is ‘<samp>@</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>enable-bracketed-paste</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-enable_002dbracketed_002dpaste"></a>
<p>When set to ‘<samp>On</samp>’, Readline will configure the terminal in a way
that will enable it to insert each paste into the editing buffer as a
single string of characters, instead of treating each character as if
it had been read from the keyboard.  This can prevent pasted characters
from being interpreted as editing commands.  The default is ‘<samp>On</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>enable-keypad</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-enable_002dkeypad"></a>
<p>When set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, Readline will try to enable the application
keypad when it is called.  Some systems need this to enable the
arrow keys.  The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>enable-meta-key</code></dt>
<dd><p>When set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, Readline will try to enable any meta modifier
key the terminal claims to support when it is called.  On many terminals,
the meta key is used to send eight-bit characters.
The default is ‘<samp>on</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>expand-tilde</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-expand_002dtilde"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, tilde expansion is performed when Readline
attempts word completion.  The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>history-preserve-point</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-history_002dpreserve_002dpoint"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, the history code attempts to place the point (the
current cursor position) at the
same location on each history line retrieved with <code>previous-history</code>
or <code>next-history</code>.  The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>history-size</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-history_002dsize"></a>
<p>Set the maximum number of history entries saved in the history list.
If set to zero, any existing history entries are deleted and no new entries
are saved.
If set to a value less than zero, the number of history entries is not
limited.
By default, the number of history entries is not limited.
If an attempt is made to set <var>history-size</var> to a non-numeric value,
the maximum number of history entries will be set to 500.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>horizontal-scroll-mode</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-horizontal_002dscroll_002dmode"></a>
<p>This variable can be set to either ‘<samp>on</samp>’ or ‘<samp>off</samp>’.  Setting it
to ‘<samp>on</samp>’ means that the text of the lines being edited will scroll
horizontally on a single screen line when they are longer than the width
of the screen, instead of wrapping onto a new screen line.
This variable is automatically set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’ for terminals of height 1.
By default, this variable is set to ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>input-meta</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-input_002dmeta"></a>
<a name="index-meta_002dflag"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, Readline will enable eight-bit input (it
will not clear the eighth bit in the characters it reads),
regardless of what the terminal claims it can support.  The
default value is ‘<samp>off</samp>’, but Readline will set it to ‘<samp>on</samp>’ if the 
locale contains eight-bit characters.
The name <code>meta-flag</code> is a synonym for this variable.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>isearch-terminators</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-isearch_002dterminators"></a>
<p>The string of characters that should terminate an incremental search without
subsequently executing the character as a command (see <a href="#Searching">Searching</a>).
If this variable has not been given a value, the characters <tt>ESC</tt> and
<kbd>C-J</kbd> will terminate an incremental search.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>keymap</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-keymap"></a>
<p>Sets Readline’s idea of the current keymap for key binding commands.
Built-in <code>keymap</code> names are
<code>emacs</code>,
<code>emacs-standard</code>,
<code>emacs-meta</code>,
<code>emacs-ctlx</code>,
<code>vi</code>,
<code>vi-move</code>,
<code>vi-command</code>, and
<code>vi-insert</code>.
<code>vi</code> is equivalent to <code>vi-command</code> (<code>vi-move</code> is also a
synonym); <code>emacs</code> is equivalent to <code>emacs-standard</code>.
Applications may add additional names.
The default value is <code>emacs</code>.
The value of the <code>editing-mode</code> variable also affects the
default keymap.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>keyseq-timeout</code></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the duration Readline will wait for a character when reading an
ambiguous key sequence (one that can form a complete key sequence using
the input read so far, or can take additional input to complete a longer
key sequence).
If no input is received within the timeout, Readline will use the shorter
but complete key sequence.
Readline uses this value to determine whether or not input is
available on the current input source (<code>rl_instream</code> by default).
The value is specified in milliseconds, so a value of 1000 means that
Readline will wait one second for additional input.
If this variable is set to a value less than or equal to zero, or to a
non-numeric value, Readline will wait until another key is pressed to
decide which key sequence to complete.
The default value is <code>500</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mark-directories</code></dt>
<dd><p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, completed directory names have a slash
appended.  The default is ‘<samp>on</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mark-modified-lines</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-mark_002dmodified_002dlines"></a>
<p>This variable, when set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, causes Readline to display an
asterisk (‘<samp>*</samp>’) at the start of history lines which have been modified.
This variable is ‘<samp>off</samp>’ by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mark-symlinked-directories</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-mark_002dsymlinked_002ddirectories"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, completed names which are symbolic links
to directories have a slash appended (subject to the value of
<code>mark-directories</code>).
The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>match-hidden-files</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-match_002dhidden_002dfiles"></a>
<p>This variable, when set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, causes Readline to match files whose
names begin with a ‘<samp>.</samp>’ (hidden files) when performing filename
completion.
If set to ‘<samp>off</samp>’, the leading ‘<samp>.</samp>’ must be
supplied by the user in the filename to be completed.
This variable is ‘<samp>on</samp>’ by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>menu-complete-display-prefix</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-menu_002dcomplete_002ddisplay_002dprefix"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, menu completion displays the common prefix of the
list of possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling through
the list.  The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.

</dd>
<dt><code>output-meta</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-output_002dmeta"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, Readline will display characters with the
eighth bit set directly rather than as a meta-prefixed escape
sequence.
The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’, but Readline will set it to ‘<samp>on</samp>’ if the
locale contains eight-bit characters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>page-completions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-page_002dcompletions"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, Readline uses an internal <code>more</code>-like pager
to display a screenful of possible completions at a time.
This variable is ‘<samp>on</samp>’ by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>print-completions-horizontally</code></dt>
<dd><p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, Readline will display completions with matches
sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen.
The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>revert-all-at-newline</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-revert_002dall_002dat_002dnewline"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, Readline will undo all changes to history lines
before returning when <code>accept-line</code> is executed.  By default,
history lines may be modified and retain individual undo lists across
calls to <code>readline</code>.  The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show-all-if-ambiguous</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show_002dall_002dif_002dambiguous"></a>
<p>This alters the default behavior of the completion functions.  If
set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, 
words which have more than one possible completion cause the
matches to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell.
The default value is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show-all-if-unmodified</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show_002dall_002dif_002dunmodified"></a>
<p>This alters the default behavior of the completion functions in
a fashion similar to <var>show-all-if-ambiguous</var>.
If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, 
words which have more than one possible completion without any
possible partial completion (the possible completions don’t share
a common prefix) cause the matches to be listed immediately instead
of ringing the bell.
The default value is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>show-mode-in-prompt</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-show_002dmode_002din_002dprompt"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, add a string to the beginning of the prompt
indicating the editing mode: emacs, vi command, or vi insertion.
The mode strings are user-settable (e.g., <var>emacs-mode-string</var>).
The default value is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>skip-completed-text</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-skip_002dcompleted_002dtext"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, this alters the default completion behavior when
inserting a single match into the line.  It’s only active when
performing completion in the middle of a word.  If enabled, readline
does not insert characters from the completion that match characters
after point in the word being completed, so portions of the word
following the cursor are not duplicated.
For instance, if this is enabled, attempting completion when the cursor
is after the ‘<samp>e</samp>’ in ‘<samp>Makefile</samp>’ will result in ‘<samp>Makefile</samp>’
rather than ‘<samp>Makefilefile</samp>’, assuming there is a single possible
completion.
The default value is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>vi-cmd-mode-string</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-vi_002dcmd_002dmode_002dstring"></a>
<p>If the <var>show-mode-in-prompt</var> variable is enabled,
this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary
prompt when vi editing mode is active and in command mode.
The value is expanded like a
key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and
backslash escape sequences is available.
Use the ‘<samp>\1</samp>’ and ‘<samp>\2</samp>’ escapes to begin and end sequences of
non-printing characters, which can be used to embed a terminal control
sequence into the mode string.
The default is ‘<samp>(cmd)</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>vi-ins-mode-string</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-vi_002dins_002dmode_002dstring"></a>
<p>If the <var>show-mode-in-prompt</var> variable is enabled,
this string is displayed immediately before the last line of the primary
prompt when vi editing mode is active and in insertion mode.
The value is expanded like a
key binding, so the standard set of meta- and control prefixes and
backslash escape sequences is available.
Use the ‘<samp>\1</samp>’ and ‘<samp>\2</samp>’ escapes to begin and end sequences of

sequence into the mode string.
The default is ‘<samp>(ins)</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>visible-stats</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-visible_002dstats"></a>
<p>If set to ‘<samp>on</samp>’, a character denoting a file’s type
is appended to the filename when listing possible
completions.  The default is ‘<samp>off</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

</dd>
<dt>Key Bindings</dt>
<dd><p>The syntax for controlling key bindings in the init file is
simple.  First you need to find the name of the command that you
want to change.  The following sections contain tables of the command
name, the default keybinding, if any, and a short description of what
the command does.
</p>
<p>Once you know the name of the command, simply place on a line
in the init file the name of the key
you wish to bind the command to, a colon, and then the name of the
command.
There can be no space between the key name and the colon – that will be
interpreted as part of the key name.
The name of the key can be expressed in different ways, depending on
what you find most comfortable.
</p>
<p>In addition to command names, readline allows keys to be bound
to a string that is inserted when the key is pressed (a <var>macro</var>).
</p>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><var>keyname</var>: <var><span>function-name</span></var> or <var>macro</var><!-- /@w --></dt>
<dd><p><var>keyname</var> is the name of a key spelled out in English.  For example:
</p><div>
<pre>Control-u: universal-argument
Meta-Rubout: backward-kill-word
Control-o: &#34;&gt; output&#34;
</pre></div>

<p>In the example above, <kbd>C-u</kbd> is bound to the function
<code>universal-argument</code>,
<kbd>M-DEL</kbd> is bound to the function <code>backward-kill-word</code>, and
<kbd>C-o</kbd> is bound to run the macro
expressed on the right hand side (that is, to insert the text
‘<samp>&gt; output</samp>’ into the line).
</p>
<p>A number of symbolic character names are recognized while
processing this key binding syntax:
<var>DEL</var>,
<var>ESC</var>,
<var>ESCAPE</var>,
<var>LFD</var>,
<var>NEWLINE</var>,
<var>RET</var>,
<var>RETURN</var>,
<var>RUBOUT</var>,
<var>SPACE</var>,
<var>SPC</var>,
and
<var>TAB</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&#34;<var>keyseq</var>&#34;: <var><span>function-name</span></var> or <var>macro</var><!-- /@w --></dt>
<dd><p><var>keyseq</var> differs from <var>keyname</var> above in that strings
denoting an entire key sequence can be specified, by placing
the key sequence in double quotes.  Some <small>GNU</small> Emacs style key
escapes can be used, as in the following example, but the
special character names are not recognized.
</p>
<div>
<pre>&#34;\C-u&#34;: universal-argument
&#34;\C-x\C-r&#34;: re-read-init-file
&#34;\e[11~&#34;: &#34;Function Key 1&#34;
</pre></div>

<p>In the above example, <kbd>C-u</kbd> is again bound to the function
<code>universal-argument</code> (just as it was in the first example),
‘<samp><kbd>C-x</kbd> <kbd>C-r</kbd></samp>’ is bound to the function <code>re-read-init-file</code>,
and ‘<samp><span>ESC</span> <span>[</span> <span>1</span> <span>1</span> <span>~</span></samp>’ is bound to insert
the text ‘<samp>Function Key 1</samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The following <small>GNU</small> Emacs style escape sequences are available when
specifying key sequences:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code><kbd>\C-</kbd></code></dt>
<dd><p>control prefix
</p></dd>
<dt><code><kbd>\M-</kbd></code></dt>

<dt><code><kbd>\&#34;</kbd></code></dt>
<dd><p><tt>&#34;</tt>, a double quotation mark
</p></dd>
<dt><code><kbd>\&#39;</kbd></code></dt>
<dd><p><tt>&#39;</tt>, a single quote or apostrophe
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition to the <small>GNU</small> Emacs style escape sequences, a second
set of backslash escapes is available:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>\a</code></dt>
<dd><p>alert (bell)
</p></dd>
<dt><code>\b</code></dt>
<dd><p>backspace

<dt><code>\<var>nnn</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value <var>nnn</var>
(one to three digits)

<dt><code>\x<var>HH</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value <var>HH</var>
(one or two hex digits)
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>When entering the text of a macro, single or double quotes must
be used to indicate a macro definition.
Unquoted text is assumed to be a function name.
In the macro body, the backslash escapes described above are expanded.
Backslash will quote any other character in the macro text,
including ‘<samp>&#34;</samp>’ and ‘<samp>&#39;</samp>’.
For example, the following binding will make ‘<samp><kbd>C-x</kbd> \</samp>’
insert a single ‘<samp>\</samp>’ into the line:

<h4>32.3.2 Conditional Init Constructs</h4>

<p>Readline implements a facility similar in spirit to the conditional
compilation features of the C preprocessor which allows key
bindings and variable settings to be performed as the result
of tests.  There are four parser directives used.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>$if</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>$if</code> construct allows bindings to be made based on the
editing mode, the terminal being used, or the application using
Readline.  The text of the test, after any comparison operator,
extends to the end of the line;
unless otherwise noted, no characters are required to isolate it.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>mode</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>mode=</code> form of the <code>$if</code> directive is used to test
whether Readline is in <code>emacs</code> or <code>vi</code> mode.
This may be used in conjunction
with the ‘<samp>set keymap</samp>’ command, for instance, to set bindings in
the <code>emacs-standard</code> and <code>emacs-ctlx</code> keymaps only if
Readline is starting out in <code>emacs</code> mode.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>term</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>term=</code> form may be used to include terminal-specific
key bindings, perhaps to bind the key sequences output by the
terminal’s function keys.  The word on the right side of the
‘<samp>=</samp>’ is tested against both the full name of the terminal and
the portion of the terminal name before the first ‘<samp>-</samp>’.  This
allows <code>sun</code> to match both <code>sun</code> and <code>sun-cmd</code>,
for instance.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>version</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>version</code> test may be used to perform comparisons against
specific Readline versions.
The <code>version</code> expands to the current Readline version.
The set of comparison operators includes
‘<samp>=</samp>’ (and ‘<samp>==</samp>’), ‘<samp>!=</samp>’, ‘<samp>&lt;=</samp>’, ‘<samp>&gt;=</samp>’, ‘<samp>&lt;</samp>’,
and ‘<samp>&gt;</samp>’.
The version number supplied on the right side of the operator consists
of a major version number, an optional decimal point, and an optional
minor version (e.g., ‘<samp>7.1</samp>’). If the minor version is omitted, it
is assumed to be ‘<samp>0</samp>’.
The operator may be separated from the string <code>version</code> and
from the version number argument by whitespace.
The following example sets a variable if the Readline version being used
is 7.0 or newer:
</p><div>
<pre>$if version &gt;= 7.0
set show-mode-in-prompt on
$endif
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>application</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <var>application</var> construct is used to include
application-specific settings.  Each program using the Readline
library sets the <var>application name</var>, and you can test for
a particular value. 
This could be used to bind key sequences to functions useful for
a specific program.  For instance, the following command adds a
key sequence that quotes the current or previous word in Bash:
</p><div>
<pre>$if Bash
# Quote the current or previous word
&#34;\C-xq&#34;: &#34;\eb\&#34;\ef\&#34;&#34;
$endif
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>variable</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <var>variable</var> construct provides simple equality tests for Readline
variables and values.
The permitted comparison operators are ‘<samp>=</samp>’, ‘<samp>==</samp>’, and ‘<samp>!=</samp>’.
The variable name must be separated from the comparison operator by
whitespace; the operator may be separated from the value on the right hand
side by whitespace.
Both string and boolean variables may be tested. Boolean variables must be
tested against the values <var>on</var> and <var>off</var>.
The following example is equivalent to the <code>mode=emacs</code> test described
above:
</p><div>
<pre>$if editing-mode == emacs
set show-mode-in-prompt on
$endif
</pre></div>
</dd>
</dl>

</dd>
<dt><code>$endif</code></dt>
<dd><p>This command, as seen in the previous example, terminates an
<code>$if</code> command.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>$else</code></dt>
<dd><p>Commands in this branch of the <code>$if</code> directive are executed if
the test fails.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>$include</code></dt>
<dd><p>This directive takes a single filename as an argument and reads commands
and bindings from that file.
For example, the following directive reads from <samp>/etc/inputrc</samp>:

</dt>
<dd><p>This function is intended to be bound to the &#34;bracketed paste&#34; escape
sequence sent by some terminals, and such a binding is assigned by default.
It allows Readline to insert the pasted text as a single unit without treating
each character as if it had been read from the keyboard.  The characters
are inserted as if each one was bound to <code>self-insert</code> instead of
executing any editing commands.
</p>
<p>Bracketed paste sets the region (the characters between point and the mark)
to the inserted text. It uses the concept of an <em>active mark</em>: when the
mark is active, Readline redisplay uses the terminal’s standout mode to
denote the region.

<h3>32.5 Readline vi Mode</h3>

<p>While the Readline library does not have a full set of <code>vi</code>
editing functions, it does contain enough to allow simple editing
of the line.  The Readline <code>vi</code> mode behaves as specified in
the <small>POSIX</small> standard.
</p>
<p>In order to switch interactively between <code>emacs</code> and <code>vi</code>
editing modes, use the command <kbd>M-C-j</kbd> (bound to emacs-editing-mode
when in <code>vi</code> mode and to vi-editing-mode in <code>emacs</code> mode).
The Readline default is <code>emacs</code> mode.
</p>
<p>When you enter a line in <code>vi</code> mode, you are already placed in
‘insertion’ mode, as if you had typed an ‘<samp>i</samp>’.  Pressing <tt>ESC</tt>
switches you into ‘command’ mode, where you can edit the text of the
line with the standard <code>vi</code> movement keys, move to previous
history lines with ‘<samp>k</samp>’ and subsequent lines with ‘<samp>j</samp>’, and
so forth.

<h2>33 Using History Interactively</h2>


<p>This chapter describes how to use the <small>GNU</small> History Library interactively,
from a user’s standpoint.  It should be considered a user’s guide.  For
information on using the <small>GNU</small> History Library in your own programs,
see <a href="http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/history.html#Programming-with-GNU-History">Programming with GNU History</a> in <cite>GNU History Library</cite>.

<h3>33.1 History Expansion</h3>
<a name="index-history-expansion"></a>

<p>The History library provides a history expansion feature that is similar
to the history expansion provided by <code>csh</code>.  This section
describes the syntax used to manipulate the history information.
</p>
<p>History expansions introduce words from the history list into
the input stream, making it easy to repeat commands, insert the
arguments to a previous command into the current input line, or
fix errors in previous commands quickly.
</p>

<p>History expansion takes place in two parts.  The first is to determine
which line from the history list should be used during substitution.
The second is to select portions of that line for inclusion into the
current one.  The line selected from the history is called the
<em>event</em>, and the portions of that line that are acted upon are
called <em>words</em>.  Various <em>modifiers</em> are available to manipulate
the selected words.  The line is broken into words in the same fashion
that Bash does, so that several words
surrounded by quotes are considered one word.
History expansions are introduced by the appearance of the
history expansion character, which is ‘<samp>!</samp>’ by default.
</p>
<p>History expansion implements shell-like quoting conventions:
a backslash can be used to remove the special handling for the next character;
single quotes enclose verbatim sequences of characters, and can be used to
inhibit history expansion;
and characters enclosed within double quotes may be subject to history
expansion, since backslash can escape the history expansion character,
but single quotes may not, since they are not treated specially within
double quotes.

<h4>33.1.2 Word Designators</h4>

<p>Word designators are used to select desired words from the event.
A ‘<samp>:</samp>’ separates the event specification from the word designator.  It
may be omitted if the word designator begins with a ‘<samp>^</samp>’, ‘<samp>$</samp>’,
‘<samp>*</samp>’, ‘<samp>-</samp>’, or ‘<samp>%</samp>’.  Words are numbered from the beginning
of the line, with the first word being denoted by 0 (zero).  Words are
inserted into the current line separated by single spaces.
</p>
<p>For example,
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>!!</code></dt>
<dd><p>designates the preceding command.  When you type this, the preceding
command is repeated in toto.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>!!:$</code></dt>
<dd><p>designates the last argument of the preceding command.  This may be
shortened to <code>!$</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>!fi:2</code></dt>
<dd><p>designates the second argument of the most recent command starting with
the letters <code>fi</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Here are the word designators:
</p> 
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>0 (zero)</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <code>0</code>th word.  For many applications, this is the command word.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>The <var>n</var>th word.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>^</code></dt>
<dd><p>The first argument; that is, word 1.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>$</code></dt>
<dd><p>The last argument.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>%</code></dt>
<dd><p>The first word matched by the most recent ‘<samp>?<var>string</var>?</samp>’ search,
if the search string begins with a character that is part of a word.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>x</var>-<var>y</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>A range of words; ‘<samp>-<var>y</var></samp>’ abbreviates ‘<samp>0-<var>y</var></samp>’.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>*</code></dt>
<dd><p>All of the words, except the <code>0</code>th.  This is a synonym for ‘<samp>1-$</samp>’.
It is not an error to use ‘<samp>*</samp>’ if there is just one word in the event;
the empty string is returned in that case.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>x</var>*</code></dt>
<dd><p>Abbreviates ‘<samp><var>x</var>-$</samp>’
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code><var>x</var>-</code></dt>
<dd><p>Abbreviates ‘<samp><var>x</var>-$</samp>’ like ‘<samp><var>x</var>*</samp>’, but omits the last word.
If ‘<samp>x</samp>’ is missing, it defaults to 0.

<p>If a word designator is supplied without an event specification, the
previous command is used as the event.

<a name="Modifiers-1"></a>
<h4>33.1.3 Modifiers</h4>

<p>After the optional word designator, you can add a sequence of one or more
of the following modifiers, each preceded by a ‘<samp>:</samp>’.
These modify, or edit, the word or words selected from the history event.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

The delimiter may be quoted in <var>old</var> and <var>new</var>
with a single backslash.  If ‘<samp>&amp;</samp>’ appears in <var>new</var>,
it is replaced by <var>old</var>.  A single backslash will quote
the ‘<samp>&amp;</samp>’.

substituted, or, if no previous history substitutions took place,
the last <var>string</var>
in a !?<var>string</var><code>[?]</code>
search.
If <var>new</var> is is null, each matching <var>old</var> is deleted.
The final delimiter is optional if it is the last
character on the input line.

<h2>Appendix B Formatting Documentation</h2>

<a name="index-GDB-reference-card"></a>
<a name="index-reference-card"></a>
<p>The <small>GDB</small> 4 release includes an already-formatted reference card, ready
for printing with PostScript or Ghostscript, in the <samp>gdb</samp>
subdirectory of the main source directory<a name="DOCF21" href="#FOOT21"><sup>21</sup></a>.  If you can use PostScript or Ghostscript with your printer,
you can print the reference card immediately with <samp>refcard.ps</samp>.
</p>
<p>The release also includes the source for the reference card.  You
can format it, using TeX, by typing:
</p>


<p>The <small>GDB</small> reference card is designed to print in <em>landscape</em>
mode on US “letter” size paper;
that is, on a sheet 11 inches wide by 8.5 inches
high.  You will need to specify this form of printing as an option to
your <small>DVI</small> output program.
</p>
<a name="index-documentation"></a>

<p>All the documentation for <small>GDB</small> comes as part of the machine-readable
distribution.  The documentation is written in Texinfo format, which is
a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce both
on-line information and a printed manual.  You can use one of the Info
formatting commands to create the on-line version of the documentation
and TeX (or <code>texi2roff</code>) to typeset the printed version.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> includes an already formatted copy of the on-line Info
version of this manual in the <samp>gdb</samp> subdirectory.  The main Info
file is <samp>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git/gdb/gdb.info</samp>, and it refers to
subordinate files matching ‘<samp>gdb.info*</samp>’ in the same directory.  If
necessary, you can print out these files, or read them with any editor;
but they are easier to read using the <code>info</code> subsystem in <small>GNU</small>
Emacs or the standalone <code>info</code> program, available as part of the
<small>GNU</small> Texinfo distribution.
</p>
<p>If you want to format these Info files yourself, you need one of the
Info formatting programs, such as <code>texinfo-format-buffer</code> or
<code>makeinfo</code>.
</p>
<p>If you have <code>makeinfo</code> installed, and are in the top level
<small>GDB</small> source directory (<samp>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git</samp>, in the case of
version 13.0.50.20220321-git), you can make the Info file by typing:
</p>


<p>If you want to typeset and print copies of this manual, you need TeX,
a program to print its <small>DVI</small> output files, and <samp>texinfo.tex</samp>, the
Texinfo definitions file.
</p>
<p>TeX is a typesetting program; it does not print files directly, but
produces output files called <small>DVI</small> files.  To print a typeset
document, you need a program to print <small>DVI</small> files.  If your system
has TeX installed, chances are it has such a program.  The precise
command to use depends on your system; <kbd>lpr -d</kbd> is common; another
(for PostScript devices) is <kbd>dvips</kbd>.  The <small>DVI</small> print command may
require a file name without any extension or a ‘<samp>.dvi</samp>’ extension.
</p>
<p>TeX also requires a macro definitions file called
<samp>texinfo.tex</samp>.  This file tells TeX how to typeset a document
written in Texinfo format.  On its own, TeX cannot either read or
typeset a Texinfo file.  <samp>texinfo.tex</samp> is distributed with GDB
and is located in the <samp>gdb-<var>version-number</var>/texinfo</samp>
directory.
</p>
<p>If you have TeX and a <small>DVI</small> printer program installed, you can
typeset and print this manual.  First switch to the <samp>gdb</samp>
subdirectory of the main source directory (for example, to
<samp>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git/gdb</samp>) and type:
</p>


<p>Then give <samp>gdb.dvi</samp> to your <small>DVI</small> printing program.

</dd>
<dt>iconv</dt>
<dd><p><small>GDB</small>’s features related to character sets (see <a href="#Character-Sets">Character Sets</a>) require a functioning <code>iconv</code> implementation.  If you are
on a GNU system, then this is provided by the GNU C Library.  Some
other systems also provide a working <code>iconv</code>.
</p>
<p>If <small>GDB</small> is using the <code>iconv</code> program which is installed
in a non-standard place, you will need to tell <small>GDB</small> where to
find it.  This is done with <samp>--with-iconv-bin</samp> which specifies
the directory that contains the <code>iconv</code> program.  This program is
run in order to make a list of the available character sets.
</p>
<p>On systems without <code>iconv</code>, you can install GNU Libiconv.  If
Libiconv is installed in a standard place, <small>GDB</small> will
automatically use it if it is needed.  If you have previously
installed Libiconv in a non-standard place, you can use the
<samp>--with-libiconv-prefix</samp> option to <samp>configure</samp>.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small>’s top-level <samp>configure</samp> and <samp>Makefile</samp> will
arrange to build Libiconv if a directory named <samp>libiconv</samp> appears
in the top-most source directory.  If Libiconv is built this way, and
if the operating system does not provide a suitable <code>iconv</code>
implementation, then the just-built library will automatically be used
by <small>GDB</small>.  One easy way to set this up is to download GNU

<h3>C.2 Invoking the <small>GDB</small> <samp>configure</samp> Script</h3>
<a name="index-configuring-GDB"></a>
<p><small>GDB</small> comes with a <samp>configure</samp> script that automates the process
of preparing <small>GDB</small> for installation; you can then use <code>make</code> to
build the <code>gdb</code> program.
</p>
<p>The <small>GDB</small> distribution includes all the source code you need for
<small>GDB</small> in a single directory, whose name is usually composed by
appending the version number to ‘<samp>gdb</samp>’.
</p>
<p>For example, the <small>GDB</small> version 13.0.50.20220321-git distribution is in the
<samp>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git</samp> directory.  That directory contains:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git/configure <span>(and supporting files)</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>script for configuring <small>GDB</small> and all its supporting libraries
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git/gdb</code></dt>
<dd><p>the source specific to <small>GDB</small> itself
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git/bfd</code></dt>
<dd><p>source for the Binary File Descriptor library
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git/include</code></dt>
<dd><p><small>GNU</small> include files
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git/libiberty</code></dt>
<dd><p>source for the ‘<samp>-liberty</samp>’ free software library
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git/opcodes</code></dt>
<dd><p>source for the library of opcode tables and disassemblers
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git/readline</code></dt>
<dd><p>source for the <small>GNU</small> command-line interface
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>There may be other subdirectories as well.
</p>
<p>The simplest way to configure and build <small>GDB</small> is to run <samp>configure</samp>
from the <samp>gdb-<var>version-number</var></samp> source directory, which in
this example is the <samp>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git</samp> directory.
</p>
<p>First switch to the <samp>gdb-<var>version-number</var></samp> source directory
if you are not already in it; then run <samp>configure</samp>.  Pass the
identifier for the platform on which <small>GDB</small> will run as an
argument.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>cd gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git
./configure
make
</pre></div>

<p>Running ‘<samp>configure</samp>’ and then running <code>make</code> builds the
included supporting libraries, then <code>gdb</code> itself.  The configured
source files, and the binaries, are left in the corresponding source
directories.
</p>
<p><samp>configure</samp> is a Bourne-shell (<code>/bin/sh</code>) script; if your
system does not recognize this automatically when you run a different
shell, you may need to run <code>sh</code> on it explicitly:
</p>


<p>You should run the <samp>configure</samp> script from the top directory in the
source tree, the <samp>gdb-<var>version-number</var></samp> directory.  If you run
<samp>configure</samp> from one of the subdirectories, you will configure only
that subdirectory.  That is usually not what you want.  In particular,
if you run the first <samp>configure</samp> from the <samp>gdb</samp> subdirectory
of the <samp>gdb-<var>version-number</var></samp> directory, you will omit the
configuration of <samp>bfd</samp>, <samp>readline</samp>, and other sibling
directories of the <samp>gdb</samp> subdirectory.  This leads to build errors
about missing include files such as <samp>bfd/bfd.h</samp>.
</p>
<p>You can install <code><small>GDB</small></code> anywhere.  The best way to do this
is to pass the <code>--prefix</code> option to <code>configure</code>, and then
install it with <code>make install</code>.
</p>

<a name="Compiling-GDB-in-Another-Directory"></a>
<h3>C.3 Compiling <small>GDB</small> in Another Directory</h3>

<p>If you want to run <small>GDB</small> versions for several host or target machines,
you need a different <code>gdb</code> compiled for each combination of
host and target.  <samp>configure</samp> is designed to make this easy by
allowing you to generate each configuration in a separate subdirectory,
rather than in the source directory.  If your <code>make</code> program
handles the ‘<samp>VPATH</samp>’ feature (<small>GNU</small> <code>make</code> does), running
<code>make</code> in each of these directories builds the <code>gdb</code>
program specified there.
</p>
<p>To build <code>gdb</code> in a separate directory, run <samp>configure</samp>
with the ‘<samp>--srcdir</samp>’ option to specify where to find the source.
(You also need to specify a path to find <samp>configure</samp>
itself from your working directory.  If the path to <samp>configure</samp>
would be the same as the argument to ‘<samp>--srcdir</samp>’, you can leave out
the ‘<samp>--srcdir</samp>’ option; it is assumed.)
</p>
<p>For example, with version 13.0.50.20220321-git, you can build <small>GDB</small> in a
separate directory for a Sun 4 like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>cd gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git
mkdir ../gdb-sun4
cd ../gdb-sun4
../gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git/configure
make
</pre></div>

<p>When <samp>configure</samp> builds a configuration using a remote source
directory, it creates a tree for the binaries with the same structure
(and using the same names) as the tree under the source directory.  In
the example, you’d find the Sun 4 library <samp>libiberty.a</samp> in the
directory <samp>gdb-sun4/libiberty</samp>, and <small>GDB</small> itself in
<samp>gdb-sun4/gdb</samp>.
</p>
<p>Make sure that your path to the <samp>configure</samp> script has just one
instance of <samp>gdb</samp> in it.  If your path to <samp>configure</samp> looks
like <samp>../gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git/gdb/configure</samp>, you are configuring only
one subdirectory of <small>GDB</small>, not the whole package.  This leads to
build errors about missing include files such as <samp>bfd/bfd.h</samp>.
</p>
<p>One popular reason to build several <small>GDB</small> configurations in separate
directories is to configure <small>GDB</small> for cross-compiling (where
<small>GDB</small> runs on one machine—the <em>host</em>—while debugging
programs that run on another machine—the <em>target</em>).
You specify a cross-debugging target by
giving the ‘<samp>--target=<var>target</var></samp>’ option to <samp>configure</samp>.
</p>
<p>When you run <code>make</code> to build a program or library, you must run
it in a configured directory—whatever directory you were in when you
called <samp>configure</samp> (or one of its subdirectories).
</p>
<p>The <code>Makefile</code> that <samp>configure</samp> generates in each source
directory also runs recursively.  If you type <code>make</code> in a source
directory such as <samp>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git</samp> (or in a separate configured
directory configured with ‘<samp>--srcdir=<var>dirname</var>/gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git</samp>’), you
will build all the required libraries, and then build GDB.
</p>
<p>When you have multiple hosts or targets configured in separate
directories, you can run <code>make</code> on them in parallel (for example,
if they are NFS-mounted on each of the hosts); they will not interfere
with each other.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Config-Names"></a>

<a name="Specifying-Names-for-Hosts-and-Targets"></a>
<h3>C.4 Specifying Names for Hosts and Targets</h3>

<p>The specifications used for hosts and targets in the <samp>configure</samp>
script are based on a three-part naming scheme, but some short predefined
aliases are also supported.  The full naming scheme encodes three pieces
of information in the following pattern:
</p>


<p>For example, you can use the alias <code>sun4</code> as a <var>host</var> argument,
or as the value for <var>target</var> in a <code>--target=<var>target</var></code>
option.  The equivalent full name is ‘<samp>sparc-sun-sunos4</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The <samp>configure</samp> script accompanying <small>GDB</small> does not provide
any query facility to list all supported host and target names or
aliases.  <samp>configure</samp> calls the Bourne shell script
<code>config.sub</code> to map abbreviations to full names; you can read the
script, if you wish, or you can use it to test your guesses on
abbreviations—for example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>% sh config.sub i386-linux
i386-pc-linux-gnu
% sh config.sub alpha-linux
alpha-unknown-linux-gnu
% sh config.sub hp9k700
hppa1.1-hp-hpux
% sh config.sub sun4
sparc-sun-sunos4.1.1
% sh config.sub sun3
m68k-sun-sunos4.1.1
% sh config.sub i986v
Invalid configuration `i986v&#39;: machine `i986v&#39; not recognized
</pre></div>

<p><code>config.sub</code> is also distributed in the <small>GDB</small> source
directory (<samp>gdb-13.0.50.20220321-git</samp>, for version 13.0.50.20220321-git).

<h3>C.5 <samp>configure</samp> Options</h3>

also has several other options not listed here.  See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf.html#Running-configure-Scripts">(autoconf)Running

<h3>C.6 System-wide configuration and settings</h3>
<a name="index-system_002dwide-init-file"></a>

<p><small>GDB</small> can be configured to have a system-wide init file and a
system-wide init file directory; this file and files in that directory
(if they have a recognized file extension) will be read and executed at
startup (see <a href="#Startup">What <small>GDB</small> does during startup</a>).
</p>
<p>Here are the corresponding configure options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>--with-system-gdbinit=<var>file</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specify that the default location of the system-wide init file is
<var>file</var>.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>--with-system-gdbinit-dir=<var>directory</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specify that the default location of the system-wide init file directory
is <var>directory</var>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>If <small>GDB</small> has been configured with the option <samp>--prefix=$prefix</samp>,
they may be subject to relocation.  Two possible cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If the default location of this init file/directory contains <samp>$prefix</samp>,
it will be subject to relocation.  Suppose that the configure options
are <samp>--prefix=$prefix --with-system-gdbinit=$prefix/etc/gdbinit</samp>;
if <small>GDB</small> is moved from <samp>$prefix</samp> to <samp>$install</samp>, the system
init file is looked for as <samp>$install/etc/gdbinit</samp> instead of
<samp>$prefix/etc/gdbinit</samp>.

</li><li> By contrast, if the default location does not contain the prefix,
it will not be relocated.  E.g. if <small>GDB</small> has been configured with
<samp>--prefix=/usr/local --with-system-gdbinit=/usr/share/gdb/gdbinit</samp>,
then <small>GDB</small> will always look for <samp>/usr/share/gdb/gdbinit</samp>,
wherever <small>GDB</small> is installed.
</li></ul>

<p>If the configured location of the system-wide init file (as given by the
<samp>--with-system-gdbinit</samp> option at configure time) is in the
data-directory (as specified by <samp>--with-gdb-datadir</samp> at configure
time) or in one of its subdirectories, then <small>GDB</small> will look for the
system-wide init file in the directory specified by the
<samp>--data-directory</samp> command-line option.
Note that the system-wide init file is only read once, during <small>GDB</small>
initialization.  If the data-directory is changed after <small>GDB</small> has
started with the <code>set data-directory</code> command, the file will not be

<h4>C.6.1 Installed System-wide Configuration Scripts</h4>
<a name="index-system_002dwide-configuration-scripts"></a>

<p>The <samp>system-gdbinit</samp> directory, located inside the data-directory
(as specified by <samp>--with-gdb-datadir</samp> at configure time) contains
a number of scripts which can be used as system-wide init files.  To
automatically source those scripts at startup, <small>GDB</small> should be
configured with <samp>--with-system-gdbinit</samp>.  Otherwise, any user
should be able to source them by hand as needed.
</p>
<p>The following scripts are currently available:
</p><ul>
<li> <samp>elinos.py</samp>
<a name="index-elinos_002epy"></a>
<a name="index-ELinOS-system_002dwide-configuration-script"></a>
This script is useful when debugging a program on an ELinOS target.
It takes advantage of the environment variables defined in a standard
ELinOS environment in order to determine the location of the system
shared libraries, and then sets the ‘<samp>solib-absolute-prefix</samp>’
and ‘<samp>solib-search-path</samp>’ variables appropriately.

</li><li> <samp>wrs-linux.py</samp>
<a name="index-wrs_002dlinux_002epy"></a>
<a name="index-Wind-River-Linux-system_002dwide-configuration-script"></a>
This script is useful when debugging a program on a target running
Wind River Linux.  It expects the <code>ENV_PREFIX</code> to be set to
the host-side sysroot used by the target system.

<a name="index-maintenance-commands"></a>
<a name="index-internal-commands"></a>

<p>In addition to commands intended for <small>GDB</small> users, <small>GDB</small>
includes a number of commands intended for <small>GDB</small> developers,
that are not documented elsewhere in this manual.  These commands are
provided here for reference.  (For commands that turn on debugging
messages, see <a href="#Debugging-Output">Debugging Output</a>.)

<dd><p>Translate the given <var>expression</var> into remote agent bytecodes.
This command is useful for debugging the Agent Expression mechanism
(see <a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>).  The ‘<samp>agent</samp>’ version produces an
expression useful for data collection, such as by tracepoints, while
‘<samp>maint agent-eval</samp>’ produces an expression that evaluates directly
to a result.  For instance, a collection expression for <code>globa +
globb</code> will include bytecodes to record four bytes of memory at each
of the addresses of <code>globa</code> and <code>globb</code>, while discarding
the result of the addition, while an evaluation expression will do the
addition and return the sum.
If <code>-at</code> is given, generate remote agent bytecode for <var>location</var>.
If not, generate remote agent bytecode for current frame PC address.

<p>In object files with inter-compilation-unit references, such as those

reader needs to frequently refer to previously read compilation units.
This setting controls how long a compilation unit will remain in the
cache if it is not referenced.  A higher limit means that cached
compilation units will be stored in memory longer, and more total
memory will be used.  Setting it to zero disables caching, which will
slow down <small>GDB</small> startup, but reduce memory consumption.

<a name="index-DWARF-frame-unwinders"></a>
<p>Many targets that support DWARF debugging use <small>GDB</small>’s DWARF
frame unwinders to build the backtrace.  Many of these targets will
also have a second mechanism for building the backtrace for use in
cases where DWARF information is not available, this second mechanism
is often an analysis of a function’s prologue.
</p>
<p>In order to extend testing coverage of the second level stack
unwinding mechanisms it is helpful to be able to disable the DWARF
stack unwinders, this can be done with this switch.
</p>
<p>In normal use of <small>GDB</small> disabling the DWARF unwinders is not
advisable, there are cases that are better handled through DWARF than
prologue analysis, and the debug experience is likely to be better
with the DWARF frame unwinders enabled.
</p>
<p>If DWARF frame unwinders are not supported for a particular target
architecture, then enabling this flag does not cause them to be used.

<h2>Appendix E <small>GDB</small> Remote Serial Protocol</h2>



<hr/>
<a name="Overview"></a>

<a name="Overview-1"></a>
<h3>E.1 Overview</h3>

<p>There may be occasions when you need to know something about the
protocol—for example, if there is only one serial port to your target
machine, you might want your program to do something special if it
recognizes a packet meant for <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>In the examples below, ‘<samp>-&gt;</samp>’ and ‘<samp>&lt;-</samp>’ are used to indicate
transmitted and received data, respectively.
</p>
<a name="index-protocol_002c-GDB-remote-serial"></a>
<a name="index-serial-protocol_002c-GDB-remote"></a>
<a name="index-remote-serial-protocol"></a>
<p>All <small>GDB</small> commands and responses (other than acknowledgments
and notifications, see <a href="#Notification-Packets">Notification Packets</a>) are sent as a
<var>packet</var>.  A <var>packet</var> is introduced with the character
‘<samp>$</samp>’, the actual <var>packet-data</var>, and the terminating character
‘<samp>#</samp>’ followed by a two-digit <var>checksum</var>:
</p>


<a name="index-checksum_002c-for-GDB-remote"></a>
<p>The two-digit <var>checksum</var> is computed as the modulo 256 sum of all
characters between the leading ‘<samp>$</samp>’ and the trailing ‘<samp>#</samp>’ (an
eight bit unsigned checksum).
</p>
<p>Implementors should note that prior to <small>GDB</small> 5.0 the protocol
specification also included an optional two-digit <var>sequence-id</var>:
</p>
<div>
<pre><code>$</code><var>sequence-id</var><code>:</code><var>packet-data</var><code>#</code><var>checksum</var>
</pre></div>

<a name="index-sequence_002did_002c-for-GDB-remote"></a>
<p>That <var>sequence-id</var> was appended to the acknowledgment.  <small>GDB</small>
has never output <var>sequence-id</var>s.  Stubs that handle packets added
since <small>GDB</small> 5.0 must not accept <var>sequence-id</var>.
</p>
<p>When either the host or the target machine receives a packet, the first
response expected is an acknowledgment: either ‘<samp>+</samp>’ (to indicate
the package was received correctly) or ‘<samp>-</samp>’ (to request
retransmission):
</p>
<div>
<pre>-&gt; <code>$</code><var>packet-data</var><code>#</code><var>checksum</var>
&lt;- <code>+</code>
</pre></div>

<p>The ‘<samp>+</samp>’/‘<samp>-</samp>’ acknowledgments can be disabled
once a connection is established.
See <a href="#Packet-Acknowledgment">Packet Acknowledgment</a>, for details.
</p>
<p>The host (<small>GDB</small>) sends <var>command</var>s, and the target (the
debugging stub incorporated in your program) sends a <var>response</var>.  In
the case of step and continue <var>command</var>s, the response is only sent
when the operation has completed, and the target has again stopped all
threads in all attached processes.  This is the default all-stop mode
behavior, but the remote protocol also supports <small>GDB</small>’s non-stop 
execution mode; see <a href="#Remote-Non_002dStop">Remote Non-Stop</a>, for details.
</p>
<p><var>packet-data</var> consists of a sequence of characters with the
exception of ‘<samp>#</samp>’ and ‘<samp>$</samp>’ (see ‘<samp>X</samp>’ packet for additional
exceptions).
</p>
<a name="index-remote-protocol_002c-field-separator"></a>
<p>Fields within the packet should be separated using ‘<samp>,</samp>’ ‘<samp>;</samp>’ or
‘<samp>:</samp>’.  Except where otherwise noted all numbers are represented in
<small>HEX</small> with leading zeros suppressed.
</p>
<p>Implementors should note that prior to <small>GDB</small> 5.0, the character
‘<samp>:</samp>’ could not appear as the third character in a packet (as it
would potentially conflict with the <var>sequence-id</var>).
</p>
<a name="index-remote-protocol_002c-binary-data"></a>
<a name="Binary-Data"></a><p>Binary data in most packets is encoded either as two hexadecimal
digits per byte of binary data.  This allowed the traditional remote
protocol to work over connections which were only seven-bit clean.
Some packets designed more recently assume an eight-bit clean
connection, and use a more efficient encoding to send and receive
binary data.
</p>
<p>The binary data representation uses <code>7d</code> (<small>ASCII</small> ‘<samp>}</samp>’)
as an escape character.  Any escaped byte is transmitted as the escape
character followed by the original character XORed with <code>0x20</code>.
For example, the byte <code>0x7d</code> would be transmitted as the two
bytes <code>0x7d 0x5d</code>.  The bytes <code>0x23</code> (<small>ASCII</small> ‘<samp>#</samp>’),
<code>0x24</code> (<small>ASCII</small> ‘<samp>$</samp>’), and <code>0x7d</code> (<small>ASCII</small>
‘<samp>}</samp>’) must always be escaped.  Responses sent by the stub
must also escape <code>0x2a</code> (<small>ASCII</small> ‘<samp>*</samp>’), so that it
is not interpreted as the start of a run-length encoded sequence
(described next).
</p>
<p>Response <var>data</var> can be run-length encoded to save space.
Run-length encoding replaces runs of identical characters with one
instance of the repeated character, followed by a ‘<samp>*</samp>’ and a
repeat count.  The repeat count is itself sent encoded, to avoid
binary characters in <var>data</var>: a value of <var>n</var> is sent as
<code><var>n</var>+29</code>.  For a repeat count greater or equal to 3, this
produces a printable <small>ASCII</small> character, e.g. a space (<small>ASCII</small>
code 32) for a repeat count of 3.  (This is because run-length
encoding starts to win for counts 3 or more.)  Thus, for example,
‘<samp>0* </samp>’ is a run-length encoding of “0000”: the space character
after ‘<samp>*</samp>’ means repeat the leading <code>0</code> <code>32 <span>-</span> 29 = 3</code><!-- /@w --> more times.
</p>
<p>The printable characters ‘<samp>#</samp>’ and ‘<samp>$</samp>’ or with a numeric value
greater than 126 must not be used.  Runs of six repeats (‘<samp>#</samp>’) or
seven repeats (‘<samp>$</samp>’) can be expanded using a repeat count of only
five (‘<samp>&#34;</samp>’).  For example, ‘<samp>00000000</samp>’ can be encoded as
‘<samp>0*&#34;00</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The error response returned for some packets includes a two character
error number.  That number is not well defined.
</p>
<a name="index-empty-response_002c-for-unsupported-packets"></a>
<p>For any <var>command</var> not supported by the stub, an empty response
(‘<samp>$#00</samp>’) should be returned.  That way it is possible to extend the
protocol.  A newer <small>GDB</small> can tell if a packet is supported based
on that response.
</p>
<p>At a minimum, a stub is required to support the ‘<samp>?</samp>’ command to
tell <small>GDB</small> the reason for halting, ‘<samp>g</samp>’ and ‘<samp>G</samp>’
commands for register access, and the ‘<samp>m</samp>’ and ‘<samp>M</samp>’ commands
for memory access.  Stubs that only control single-threaded targets
can implement run control with the ‘<samp>c</samp>’ (continue) command, and if
the target architecture supports hardware-assisted single-stepping,
the ‘<samp>s</samp>’ (step) command.  Stubs that support multi-threading
targets should support the ‘<samp>vCont</samp>’ command.  All other commands
are optional.

<h3>E.2 Packets</h3>

<p>The following table provides a complete list of all currently defined
<var>command</var>s and their corresponding response <var>data</var>.
See <a href="#File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension">File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension</a>, for details about the File
I/O extension of the remote protocol.
</p>
<p>Each packet’s description has a template showing the packet’s overall
syntax, followed by an explanation of the packet’s meaning.  We
include spaces in some of the templates for clarity; these are not
part of the packet’s syntax.  No <small>GDB</small> packet uses spaces to
separate its components.  For example, a template like ‘<samp>foo
<var>bar</var> <var>baz</var></samp>’ describes a packet beginning with the three ASCII
bytes ‘<samp>foo</samp>’, followed by a <var>bar</var>, followed directly by a
<var>baz</var>.  <small>GDB</small> does not transmit a space character between the
‘<samp>foo</samp>’ and the <var>bar</var>, or between the <var>bar</var> and the
<var>baz</var>.
</p>
<a name="index-thread_002did_002c-in-remote-protocol"></a>
<a name="thread_002did-syntax"></a><p>Several packets and replies include a <var>thread-id</var> field to identify
a thread.  Normally these are positive numbers with a target-specific
interpretation, formatted as big-endian hex strings.  A <var>thread-id</var>
can also be a literal ‘<samp>-1</samp>’ to indicate all threads, or ‘<samp>0</samp>’ to
pick any thread.
</p>
<p>In addition, the remote protocol supports a multiprocess feature in
which the <var>thread-id</var> syntax is extended to optionally include both
process and thread ID fields, as ‘<samp>p<var>pid</var>.<var>tid</var></samp>’.
The <var>pid</var> (process) and <var>tid</var> (thread) components each have the
format described above: a positive number with target-specific
interpretation formatted as a big-endian hex string, literal ‘<samp>-1</samp>’
to indicate all processes or threads (respectively), or ‘<samp>0</samp>’ to
indicate an arbitrary process or thread.  Specifying just a process, as
‘<samp>p<var>pid</var></samp>’, is equivalent to ‘<samp>p<var>pid</var>.-1</samp>’.  It is an
error to specify all processes but a specific thread, such as
‘<samp>p-1.<var>tid</var></samp>’.  Note that the ‘<samp>p</samp>’ prefix is <em>not</em> used
for those packets and replies explicitly documented to include a process
ID, rather than a <var>thread-id</var>.
</p>
<p>The multiprocess <var>thread-id</var> syntax extensions are only used if both
<small>GDB</small> and the stub report support for the ‘<samp>multiprocess</samp>’
feature using ‘<samp>qSupported</samp>’.  See <a href="#multiprocess-extensions">multiprocess extensions</a>, for
more information.

<p>Kill request.

<p>The exact effect of this packet is not specified.
</p>
<p>For a bare-metal target, it may power cycle or reset the target
system.  For that reason, the ‘<samp>k</samp>’ packet has no reply.
</p>
<p>For a single-process target, it may kill that process if possible.
</p>
<p>A multiple-process target may choose to kill just one process, or all
that are under <small>GDB</small>’s control.  For more precise control, use
the vKill packet (see <a href="#vKill-packet">vKill packet</a>).
</p>
<p>If the target system immediately closes the connection in response to
‘<samp>k</samp>’, <small>GDB</small> does not consider the lack of packet
acknowledgment to be an error, and assumes the kill was successful.
</p>
<p>If connected using <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd>, and the target does
not close the connection in response to a kill request, <small>GDB</small>
probes the target state as if a new connection was opened
(see <a href="#g_t_003f-packet">? packet</a>).

<p>The ‘<samp>t</samp>’ action is only relevant in non-stop mode

A stop reply should be generated for any affected thread not already stopped.
When a thread is stopped by means of a ‘<samp>t</samp>’ action,
the corresponding stop reply should indicate that the thread has stopped with
signal ‘<samp>0</samp>’, regardless of whether the target uses some other signal
as an implementation detail.
</p>
<p>The server must ignore ‘<samp>c</samp>’, ‘<samp>C</samp>’, ‘<samp>s</samp>’, ‘<samp>S</samp>’, and

the server must ignore ‘<samp>t</samp>’ actions for threads that are already
stopped.

<p>The correct reply to an unknown ‘<samp>v</samp>’ packet is to return the empty

incorrectly return ‘<samp>OK</samp>’ for unknown ‘<samp>v</samp>’ packets.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>vMustReplyEmpty</samp>’ is used as a feature test to check how
<code>gdbserver</code> handles unknown packets, it is important that this
packet be handled in the same way as other unknown ‘<samp>v</samp>’ packets.
If this packet is handled differently to other unknown ‘<samp>v</samp>’

<p>Insert (‘<samp>Z0</samp>’) or remove (‘<samp>z0</samp>’) a software breakpoint at address
<var>addr</var> of type <var>kind</var>.
</p>
<p>A software breakpoint is implemented by replacing the instruction at
<var>addr</var> with a software breakpoint or trap instruction.  The
<var>kind</var> is target-specific and typically indicates the size of the
breakpoint in bytes that should be inserted.  E.g., the <small>ARM</small> and
<small>MIPS</small> can insert either a 2 or 4 byte breakpoint.  Some
architectures have additional meanings for <var>kind</var>
(see <a href="#Architecture_002dSpecific-Protocol-Details">Architecture-Specific Protocol Details</a>); if no
architecture-specific value is being used, it should be ‘<samp>0</samp>’.
<var>kind</var> is hex-encoded.  <var>cond_list</var> is an optional list of
conditional expressions in bytecode form that should be evaluated on
the target’s side.  These are the conditions that should be taken into
consideration when deciding if the breakpoint trigger should be
reported back to <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>See also the ‘<samp>swbreak</samp>’ stop reason (see <a href="#swbreak-stop-reason">swbreak stop reason</a>)
for how to best report a software breakpoint event to <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>The <var>cond_list</var> parameter is comprised of a series of expressions,
concatenated without separators. Each expression has the following form:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>X <var>len</var>,<var>expr</var></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p><var>len</var> is the length of the bytecode expression and <var>expr</var> is the
actual conditional expression in bytecode form.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The optional <var>cmd_list</var> parameter introduces commands that may be
run on the target, rather than being reported back to <small>GDB</small>.
The parameter starts with a numeric flag <var>persist</var>; if the flag is
nonzero, then the breakpoint may remain active and the commands
continue to be run even when <small>GDB</small> disconnects from the target.
Following this flag is a series of expressions concatenated with no
separators.  Each expression has the following form:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>X <var>len</var>,<var>expr</var></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p><var>len</var> is the length of the bytecode expression and <var>expr</var> is the

<h3>E.4 General Query Packets</h3>
<a name="index-remote-query-requests"></a>

<p>Packets starting with ‘<samp>q</samp>’ are <em>general query packets</em>;
packets starting with ‘<samp>Q</samp>’ are <em>general set packets</em>.  General
query and set packets are a semi-unified form for retrieving and
sending information to and from the stub.
</p>
<p>The initial letter of a query or set packet is followed by a name
indicating what sort of thing the packet applies to.  For example,
<small>GDB</small> may use a ‘<samp>qSymbol</samp>’ packet to exchange symbol
definitions with the stub.  These packet names follow some
conventions:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The name must not contain commas, colons or semicolons.
</li><li> Most <small>GDB</small> query and set packets have a leading upper case
letter.
</li><li> The names of custom vendor packets should use a company prefix, in
lower case, followed by a period.  For example, packets designed at
the Acme Corporation might begin with ‘<samp>qacme.foo</samp>’ (for querying
foos) or ‘<samp>Qacme.bar</samp>’ (for setting bars).
</li></ul>

<p>The name of a query or set packet should be separated from any
parameters by a ‘<samp>:</samp>’; the parameters themselves should be
separated by ‘<samp>,</samp>’ or ‘<samp>;</samp>’.  Stubs must be careful to match the
full packet name, and check for a separator or the end of the packet,
in case two packet names share a common prefix.  New packets should not begin
with ‘<samp>qC</samp>’, ‘<samp>qP</samp>’, or ‘<samp>qL</samp>’<a name="DOCF22" href="#FOOT22"><sup>22</sup></a>.
</p>
<p>Like the descriptions of the other packets, each description here
has a template showing the packet’s overall syntax, followed by an
explanation of the packet’s meaning.  We include spaces in some of the
templates for clarity; these are not part of the packet’s syntax.  No
<small>GDB</small> packet uses spaces to separate its components.
</p>
<p>Here are the currently defined query and set packets:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>QAgent:1</samp>’</dt>
<dt>‘<samp>QAgent:0</samp>’</dt>

</dd>

<dd><a name="index-QAllow-packet"></a>
<p>Specify which operations <small>GDB</small> expects to request of the
target, as a semicolon-separated list of operation name and value
pairs.  Possible values for <var>op</var> include ‘<samp>WriteReg</samp>’,
‘<samp>WriteMem</samp>’, ‘<samp>InsertBreak</samp>’, ‘<samp>InsertTrace</samp>’,
‘<samp>InsertFastTrace</samp>’, and ‘<samp>Stop</samp>’. <var>val</var> is either 0,
indicating that <small>GDB</small> will not request the operation, or 1,
indicating that it may.  (The target can then use this to set up its
own internals optimally, for instance if the debugger never expects to
insert breakpoints, it may not need to install its own trap handler.)

</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> This is the same CRC used in validating separate debug
files (see <a href="#Separate-Debug-Files">Debugging Information in Separate
Files</a>).  However the algorithm is slightly different.  When validating
separate debug files, the CRC is computed taking the <em>least</em>
significant bit of each byte first, and the final result is inverted to
detect trailing zeros.

may be too many active threads to fit into one reply packet, this query
works iteratively: it may require more than one query/reply sequence to
obtain the entire list of threads.  The first query of the sequence will
be the ‘<samp>qfThreadInfo</samp>’ query; subsequent queries in the
sequence will be the ‘<samp>qsThreadInfo</samp>’ query.

<p>In response to each query, the target will reply with a list of one or
more thread IDs, separated by commas.
<small>GDB</small> will respond to each reply with a request for more thread
ids (using the ‘<samp>qs</samp>’ form of the query), until the target responds
with ‘<samp>l</samp>’ (lower-case ell, for <em>last</em>).
Refer to <a href="#thread_002did-syntax">thread-id syntax</a>, for the format of the <var>thread-id</var>
fields.
</p>
<p><em>Note: <small>GDB</small> will send the <code>qfThreadInfo</code> query during the
initial connection with the remote target, and the very first thread ID
mentioned in the reply will be stopped by <small>GDB</small> in a subsequent
message.  Therefore, the stub should ensure that the first thread ID in
the <code>qfThreadInfo</code> reply is suitable for being stopped by <small>GDB</small>.</em>

<a name="qSupported"></a><p>Tell the remote stub about features supported by <small>GDB</small>, and
query the stub for features it supports.  This packet allows
<small>GDB</small> and the remote stub to take advantage of each others’
features.  ‘<samp>qSupported</samp>’ also consolidates multiple feature probes
at startup, to improve <small>GDB</small> performance—a single larger
packet performs better than multiple smaller probe packets on
high-latency links.  Some features may enable behavior which must not
be on by default, e.g. because it would confuse older clients or
stubs.  Other features may describe packets which could be
automatically probed for, but are not.  These features must be
reported before <small>GDB</small> will use them.  This “default
unsupported” behavior is not appropriate for all packets, but it
helps to keep the initial connection time under control with new
versions of <small>GDB</small> which support increasing numbers of packets.

<dt>‘<samp><!-- /@w --></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>An empty reply indicates that ‘<samp>qSupported</samp>’ is not recognized,

</dl>

<p>The allowed forms for each feature (either a <var>gdbfeature</var> in the
‘<samp>qSupported</samp>’ packet, or a <var>stubfeature</var> in the response)
are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp><var>name</var>=<var>value</var></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The remote protocol feature <var>name</var> is supported, and associated
with the specified <var>value</var>.  The format of <var>value</var> depends
on the feature, but it must not include a semicolon.

<p>Whenever the stub receives a ‘<samp>qSupported</samp>’ request, the
supplied set of <small>GDB</small> features should override any previous
request.  This allows <small>GDB</small> to put the stub in a known
state, even if the stub had previously been communicating with
a different version of <small>GDB</small>.

<p>The following values of <var>gdbfeature</var> (for the packet sent by <small>GDB</small>)

<p>Stubs should ignore any unknown values for
<var>gdbfeature</var>.  Any <small>GDB</small> which sends a ‘<samp>qSupported</samp>’
packet supports receiving packets of unlimited length (earlier
versions of <small>GDB</small> may reject overly long responses).  Additional values
for <var>gdbfeature</var> may be defined in the future to let the stub take
advantage of new features in <small>GDB</small>, e.g. incompatible
improvements in the remote protocol—the ‘<samp>multiprocess</samp>’ feature is
an example of such a feature.  The stub’s reply should be independent
of the <var>gdbfeature</var> entries sent by <small>GDB</small>; first <small>GDB</small>
describes all the features it supports, and then the stub replies with
all the features it supports.
</p>
<p>Similarly, <small>GDB</small> will silently ignore unrecognized stub feature
responses, as long as each response uses one of the standard forms.
</p>
<p>Some features are flags.  A stub which supports a flag feature
should respond with a ‘<samp>+</samp>’ form response.  Other features
require values, and the stub should respond with an ‘<samp>=</samp>’
form response.
</p>
<p>Each feature has a default value, which <small>GDB</small> will use if
‘<samp>qSupported</samp>’ is not available or if the feature is not mentioned
in the ‘<samp>qSupported</samp>’ response.  The default values are fixed; a
stub is free to omit any feature responses that match the defaults.
</p>
<p>Not all features can be probed, but for those which can, the probing
mechanism is useful: in some cases, a stub’s internal
architecture may not allow the protocol layer to know some information
about the underlying target in advance.  This is especially common in
stubs which may be configured for multiple targets.

<h3>E.6 Tracepoint Packets</h3>
<a name="index-tracepoint-packets"></a>
<a name="index-packets_002c-tracepoint"></a>

<p>Here we describe the packets <small>GDB</small> uses to implement
tracepoints (see <a href="#Tracepoints">Tracepoints</a>).
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>QTDP:<var>n</var>:<var>addr</var>:<var>ena</var>:<var>step</var>:<var>pass</var>[:F<var>flen</var>][:X<var>len</var>,<var>bytes</var>]<span>[</span>-<span>]</span></samp>’</dt>
<dd><a name="index-QTDP-packet"></a>
<p>Create a new tracepoint, number <var>n</var>, at <var>addr</var>.  If <var>ena</var>
is ‘<samp>E</samp>’, then the tracepoint is enabled; if it is ‘<samp>D</samp>’, then
the tracepoint is disabled.  The <var>step</var> gives the tracepoint’s step
count, and <var>pass</var> gives its pass count.  If an ‘<samp>F</samp>’ is present,
then the tracepoint is to be a fast tracepoint, and the <var>flen</var> is
the number of bytes that the target should copy elsewhere to make room
for the tracepoint.  If an ‘<samp>X</samp>’ is present, it introduces a
tracepoint condition, which consists of a hexadecimal length, followed
by a comma and hex-encoded bytes, in a manner similar to action
encodings as described below.  If the trailing ‘<samp>-</samp>’ is present,
further ‘<samp>QTDP</samp>’ packets will follow to specify this tracepoint’s
actions.

<dt>‘<samp>QTDP:-<var>n</var>:<var>addr</var>:<span>[</span>S<span>]</span><var>action</var>…<span>[</span>-<span>]</span></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Define actions to be taken when a tracepoint is hit.  The <var>n</var> and
<var>addr</var> must be the same as in the initial ‘<samp>QTDP</samp>’ packet for
this tracepoint.  This packet may only be sent immediately after
another ‘<samp>QTDP</samp>’ packet that ended with a ‘<samp>-</samp>’.  If the
trailing ‘<samp>-</samp>’ is present, further ‘<samp>QTDP</samp>’ packets will follow,
specifying more actions for this tracepoint.
</p>
<p>In the series of action packets for a given tracepoint, at most one
can have an ‘<samp>S</samp>’ before its first <var>action</var>.  If such a packet
is sent, it and the following packets define “while-stepping”
actions.  Any prior packets define ordinary actions — that is, those
taken when the tracepoint is first hit.  If no action packet has an
‘<samp>S</samp>’, then all the packets in the series specify ordinary
tracepoint actions.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp><var>action</var>…</samp>’ portion of the packet is a series of
actions, concatenated without separators.  Each action has one of the
following forms:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>R <var>mask</var></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Collect the registers whose bits are set in <var>mask</var>,
a hexadecimal number whose <var>i</var>’th bit is set if register number
<var>i</var> should be collected.  (The least significant bit is numbered
zero.)  Note that <var>mask</var> may be any number of digits long; it may
not fit in a 32-bit word.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>M <var>basereg</var>,<var>offset</var>,<var>len</var></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Collect <var>len</var> bytes of memory starting at the address in register
number <var>basereg</var>, plus <var>offset</var>.  If <var>basereg</var> is
‘<samp>-1</samp>’, then the range has a fixed address: <var>offset</var> is the
address of the lowest byte to collect.  The <var>basereg</var>,
<var>offset</var>, and <var>len</var> parameters are all unsigned hexadecimal
values (the ‘<samp>-1</samp>’ value for <var>basereg</var> is a special case).
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp>X <var>len</var>,<var>expr</var></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>Evaluate <var>expr</var>, whose length is <var>len</var>, and collect memory as
it directs.  The agent expression <var>expr</var> is as described in
<a href="#Agent-Expressions">Agent Expressions</a>.  Each byte of the expression is encoded as a
two-digit hex number in the packet; <var>len</var> is the number of bytes
in the expression (and thus one-half the number of hex digits in the
packet).
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Any number of actions may be packed together in a single ‘<samp>QTDP</samp>’
packet, as long as the packet does not exceed the maximum packet
length (400 bytes, for many stubs).  There may be only one ‘<samp>R</samp>’
action per tracepoint, and it must precede any ‘<samp>M</samp>’ or ‘<samp>X</samp>’
actions.  Any registers referred to by ‘<samp>M</samp>’ and ‘<samp>X</samp>’ actions
must be collected by a preceding ‘<samp>R</samp>’ action.  (The
“while-stepping” actions are treated as if they were attached to a
separate tracepoint, as far as these restrictions are concerned.)

<p>Specify a source string of tracepoint <var>n</var> at address <var>addr</var>.
This is useful to get accurate reproduction of the tracepoints
originally downloaded at the beginning of the trace run.  The <var>type</var>
is the name of the tracepoint part, such as ‘<samp>cond</samp>’ for the
tracepoint’s conditional expression (see below for a list of types), while
<var>bytes</var> is the string, encoded in hexadecimal.
</p>
<p><var>start</var> is the offset of the <var>bytes</var> within the overall source
string, while <var>slen</var> is the total length of the source string.
This is intended for handling source strings that are longer than will
fit in a single packet.
</p>
<p>The available string types are ‘<samp>at</samp>’ for the location,
‘<samp>cond</samp>’ for the conditional, and ‘<samp>cmd</samp>’ for an action command.
<small>GDB</small> sends a separate packet for each command in the action
list, in the same order in which the commands are stored in the list.
</p>
<p>The target does not need to do anything with source strings except
report them back as part of the replies to the ‘<samp>qTfP</samp>’/‘<samp>qTsP</samp>’
query packets.
</p>
<p>Although this packet is optional, and <small>GDB</small> will only send it
if the target replies with ‘<samp>TracepointSource</samp>’ See <a href="#General-Query-Packets">General Query Packets</a>, it makes both disconnected tracing and trace files
much easier to use.  Otherwise the user must be careful that the
tracepoints in effect while looking at trace frames are identical to
the ones in effect during the trace run; even a small discrepancy
could cause ‘<samp>tdump</samp>’ not to work, or a particular trace frame not
be found.

<a name="index-QTDV-packet"></a>
<p>Create a new trace state variable, number <var>n</var>, with an initial
value of <var>value</var>, which is a 64-bit signed integer.  Both <var>n</var>
and <var>value</var> are encoded as hexadecimal values. <small>GDB</small> has
the option of not using this packet for initial values of zero; the
target should simply create the trace state variables as they are
mentioned in expressions.  The value <var>builtin</var> should be 1 (one)
if the trace state variable is builtin and 0 (zero) if it is not builtin.
<small>GDB</small> only sets <var>builtin</var> to 1 if a previous ‘<samp>qTfV</samp>’ or
‘<samp>qTsV</samp>’ packet had it set.  The contents of <var>name</var> is the
hex-encoded name (without the leading ‘<samp>$</samp>’) of the trace state
variable.

</p>
<p>A successful reply from the stub indicates that the stub has found the
requested frame.  The response is a series of parts, concatenated
without separators, describing the frame we selected.  Each part has
one of the following forms:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<p>This packet requests the minimum length of instruction at which a fast
tracepoint (see <a href="#Set-Tracepoints">Set Tracepoints</a>) may be placed.  For instance, on
the 32-bit x86 architecture, it is possible to use a 4-byte jump, but
it depends on the target system being able to create trampolines in
the first 64K of memory, which might or might not be possible for that
system.  So the reply to this packet will be 4 if it is able to
arrange for that.

<p><small>GDB</small> uses this to mark read-only regions of memory, like those

<a name="Relocate-instruction-reply-packet"></a>
<h4>E.6.1 Relocate instruction reply packet</h4>
<p>When installing fast tracepoints in memory, the target may need to
relocate the instruction currently at the tracepoint address to a
different address in memory.  For most instructions, a simple copy is
enough, but, for example, call instructions that implicitly push the
return address on the stack, and relative branches or other
PC-relative instructions require offset adjustment, so that the effect
of executing the instruction at a different address is the same as if
it had executed in the original location.
</p>
<p>In response to several of the tracepoint packets, the target may also
respond with a number of intermediate ‘<samp>qRelocInsn</samp>’ request
packets before the final result packet, to have <small>GDB</small> handle
this relocation operation.  If a packet supports this mechanism, its
documentation will explicitly say so.  See for example the above
descriptions for the ‘<samp>QTStart</samp>’ and ‘<samp>QTDP</samp>’ packets.  The
format of the request is:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<dd>
<p>This requests <small>GDB</small> to copy instruction at address <var>from</var>

<h3>E.7 Host I/O Packets</h3>
<a name="index-Host-I_002fO_002c-remote-protocol"></a>
<a name="index-file-transfer_002c-remote-protocol"></a>

<p>The <em>Host I/O</em> packets allow <small>GDB</small> to perform I/O
operations on the far side of a remote link.  For example, Host I/O is
used to upload and download files to a remote target with its own
filesystem.  Host I/O uses the same constant values and data structure
layout as the target-initiated File-I/O protocol.  However, the
Host I/O packets are structured differently.  The target-initiated
protocol relies on target memory to store parameters and buffers.
Host I/O requests are initiated by <small>GDB</small>, and the
target’s memory is not involved.  See <a href="#File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension">File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension</a>, for more details on the target-initiated protocol.
</p>
<p>The Host I/O request packets all encode a single operation along with
its arguments.  They have this format:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>vFile:<var>operation</var>: <var>parameter</var>…</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p><var>operation</var> is the name of the particular request; the target
should compare the entire packet name up to the second colon when checking
for a supported operation.  The format of <var>parameter</var> depends on
the operation.  Numbers are always passed in hexadecimal.  Negative
numbers have an explicit minus sign (i.e. two’s complement is not
used).  Strings (e.g. filenames) are encoded as a series of
hexadecimal bytes.  The last argument to a system call may be a
buffer of escaped binary data (see <a href="#Binary-Data">Binary Data</a>).
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The valid responses to Host I/O packets are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>F <var>result</var> [, <var>errno</var>] [; <var>attachment</var>]</samp>’</dt>
<dd><p><var>result</var> is the integer value returned by this operation, usually
non-negative for success and -1 for errors.  If an error has occured,
<var>errno</var> will be included in the result specifying a
value defined by the File-I/O protocol (see <a href="#Errno-Values">Errno Values</a>).  For
operations which return data, <var>attachment</var> supplies the data as a
binary buffer.  Binary buffers in response packets are escaped in the
normal way (see <a href="#Binary-Data">Binary Data</a>).  See the individual packet
documentation for the interpretation of <var>result</var> and
<var>attachment</var>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>‘<samp><!-- /@w --></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>An empty response indicates that this operation is not recognized.

<dd><p>Open a file at <var>filename</var> and return a file descriptor for it, or
return -1 if an error occurs.  The <var>filename</var> is a string,

<h3>E.8 Interrupts</h3>
<a name="index-interrupts-_0028remote-protocol_0029"></a>
<a name="interrupting-remote-targets"></a>
<p>In all-stop mode, when a program on the remote target is running,
<small>GDB</small> may attempt to interrupt it by sending a ‘<samp>Ctrl-C</samp>’,
<code>BREAK</code> or a <code>BREAK</code> followed by <code>g</code>, control of which
is specified via <small>GDB</small>’s ‘<samp>interrupt-sequence</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The precise meaning of <code>BREAK</code> is defined by the transport
mechanism and may, in fact, be undefined.  <small>GDB</small> does not
currently define a <code>BREAK</code> mechanism for any of the network
interfaces except for TCP, in which case <small>GDB</small> sends the
<code>telnet</code> BREAK sequence.
</p>
<p>‘<samp>Ctrl-C</samp>’, on the other hand, is defined and implemented for all
transport mechanisms.  It is represented by sending the single byte
<code>0x03</code> without any of the usual packet overhead described in
the Overview section (see <a href="#Overview">Overview</a>).  When a <code>0x03</code> byte is
transmitted as part of a packet, it is considered to be packet data
and does <em>not</em> represent an interrupt.  E.g., an ‘<samp>X</samp>’ packet
(see <a href="#X-packet">X packet</a>), used for binary downloads, may include an unescaped
<code>0x03</code> as part of its packet.
</p>
<p><code>BREAK</code> followed by <code>g</code> is also known as Magic SysRq g.
When Linux kernel receives this sequence from serial port,
it stops execution and connects to gdb.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, because packet resumptions are asynchronous
(see <a href="#vCont-packet">vCont packet</a>), <small>GDB</small> is always free to send a remote
command to the remote stub, even when the target is running.  For that
reason, <small>GDB</small> instead sends a regular packet (see <a href="#vCtrlC-packet">vCtrlC packet</a>) with the usual packet framing instead of the single byte
<code>0x03</code>.
</p>
<p>Stubs are not required to recognize these interrupt mechanisms and the
precise meaning associated with receipt of the interrupt is
implementation defined.  If the target supports debugging of multiple
threads and/or processes, it should attempt to interrupt all 
currently-executing threads and processes.
If the stub is successful at interrupting the
running program, it should send one of the stop
reply packets (see <a href="#Stop-Reply-Packets">Stop Reply Packets</a>) to <small>GDB</small> as a result
of successfully stopping the program in all-stop mode, and a stop reply
for each stopped thread in non-stop mode.
Interrupts received while the
program is stopped are queued and the program will be interrupted when
it is resumed next time.

<a name="Notification-Packets-1"></a>
<h3>E.9 Notification Packets</h3>
<a name="index-notification-packets"></a>
<a name="index-packets_002c-notification"></a>

<p>The <small>GDB</small> remote serial protocol includes <em>notifications</em>,
packets that require no acknowledgment.  Both the GDB and the stub
may send notifications (although the only notifications defined at
present are sent by the stub).  Notifications carry information
without incurring the round-trip latency of an acknowledgment, and so
are useful for low-impact communications where occasional packet loss
is not a problem.
</p>
<p>A notification packet has the form ‘<samp>% <var>data</var> #
<var>checksum</var></samp>’, where <var>data</var> is the content of the notification,
and <var>checksum</var> is a checksum of <var>data</var>, computed and formatted
as for ordinary <small>GDB</small> packets.  A notification’s <var>data</var>
never contains ‘<samp>$</samp>’, ‘<samp>%</samp>’ or ‘<samp>#</samp>’ characters.  Upon
receiving a notification, the recipient sends no ‘<samp>+</samp>’ or ‘<samp>-</samp>’
to acknowledge the notification’s receipt or to report its corruption.
</p>
<p>Every notification’s <var>data</var> begins with a name, which contains no
colon characters, followed by a colon character.
</p>
<p>Recipients should silently ignore corrupted notifications and
notifications they do not understand.  Recipients should restart
timeout periods on receipt of a well-formed notification, whether or
not they understand it.
</p>
<p>Senders should only send the notifications described here when this
protocol description specifies that they are permitted.  In the
future, we may extend the protocol to permit existing notifications in
new contexts; this rule helps older senders avoid confusing newer
recipients.
</p>
<p>(Older versions of <small>GDB</small> ignore bytes received until they see
the ‘<samp>$</samp>’ byte that begins an ordinary packet, so new stubs may
transmit notifications without fear of confusing older clients.  There
are no notifications defined for <small>GDB</small> to send at the moment, but we
assume that most older stubs would ignore them, as well.)
</p>
<p>Each notification is comprised of three parts:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp><var>name</var>:<var>event</var></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The notification packet is sent by the side that initiates the
exchange (currently, only the stub does that), with <var>event</var>
carrying the specific information about the notification, and
<var>name</var> specifying the name of the notification.
</p></dd>
<dt>‘<samp><var>ack</var></samp>’</dt>
<dd><p>The acknowledge sent by the other side, usually <small>GDB</small>, to
acknowledge the exchange and request the event.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The purpose of an asynchronous notification mechanism is to report to
<small>GDB</small> that something interesting happened in the remote stub.
</p>
<p>The remote stub may send notification <var>name</var>:<var>event</var>
at any time, but <small>GDB</small> acknowledges the notification when
appropriate.  The notification event is pending before <small>GDB</small>
acknowledges.  Only one notification at a time may be pending; if
additional events occur before <small>GDB</small> has acknowledged the
previous notification, they must be queued by the stub for later
synchronous transmission in response to <var>ack</var> packets from
<small>GDB</small>.  Because the notification mechanism is unreliable,
the stub is permitted to resend a notification if it believes
<small>GDB</small> may not have received it.
</p>
<p>Specifically, notifications may appear when <small>GDB</small> is not
otherwise reading input from the stub, or when <small>GDB</small> is
expecting to read a normal synchronous response or a
‘<samp>+</samp>’/‘<samp>-</samp>’ acknowledgment to a packet it has sent.
Notification packets are distinct from any other communication from
the stub so there is no ambiguity.
</p>
<p>After receiving a notification, <small>GDB</small> shall acknowledge it by
sending a <var>ack</var> packet as a regular, synchronous request to the
stub.  Such acknowledgment is not required to happen immediately, as
<small>GDB</small> is permitted to send other, unrelated packets to the
stub first, which the stub should process normally.
</p>
<p>Upon receiving a <var>ack</var> packet, if the stub has other queued
events to report to <small>GDB</small>, it shall respond by sending a
normal <var>event</var>.  <small>GDB</small> shall then send another <var>ack</var>
packet to solicit further responses; again, it is permitted to send
other, unrelated packets as well which the stub should process
normally.
</p>
<p>If the stub receives a <var>ack</var> packet and there are no additional
<var>event</var> to report, the stub shall return an ‘<samp>OK</samp>’ response.
At this point, <small>GDB</small> has finished processing a notification
and the stub has completed sending any queued events.  <small>GDB</small>
won’t accept any new notifications until the final ‘<samp>OK</samp>’ is
received .  If further notification events occur, the stub shall send
a new notification, <small>GDB</small> shall accept the notification, and
the process shall be repeated.
</p>
<p>The process of asynchronous notification can be illustrated by the
following example:
</p><div>
<pre>&lt;- <code>%Stop:T0505:98e7ffbf;04:4ce6ffbf;08:b1b6e54c;thread:p7526.7526;core:0;</code>
<code>...</code>
-&gt; <code>vStopped</code>
&lt;- <code>T0505:68f37db7;04:40f37db7;08:63850408;thread:p7526.7528;core:0;</code>
-&gt; <code>vStopped</code>
&lt;- <code>T0505:68e3fdb6;04:40e3fdb6;08:63850408;thread:p7526.7529;core:0;</code>
-&gt; <code>vStopped</code>
&lt;- <code>OK</code>
</pre></div>

<p>The following notifications are defined:
</p><table>
<tbody><tr><td>Notification</td><td>Ack</td><td>Event</td><td>Description</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stop</td><td>vStopped</td><td><var>reply</var>.  The <var>reply</var> has the form of a stop reply, as
described in <a href="#Stop-Reply-Packets">Stop Reply Packets</a>.  Refer to <a href="#Remote-Non_002dStop">Remote Non-Stop</a>,
for information on how these notifications are acknowledged by 
<small>GDB</small>.</td><td>Report an asynchronous stop event in non-stop mode.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<a name="Remote-Non_002dStop"></a>

<a name="Remote-Protocol-Support-for-Non_002dStop-Mode"></a>
<h3>E.10 Remote Protocol Support for Non-Stop Mode</h3>

<p><small>GDB</small>’s remote protocol supports non-stop debugging of
multi-threaded programs, as described in <a href="#Non_002dStop-Mode">Non-Stop Mode</a>.  If the stub
supports non-stop mode, it should report that to <small>GDB</small> by including
‘<samp>QNonStop+</samp>’ in its ‘<samp>qSupported</samp>’ response (see <a href="#qSupported">qSupported</a>).
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> typically sends a ‘<samp>QNonStop</samp>’ packet only when
establishing a new connection with the stub.  Entering non-stop mode
does not alter the state of any currently-running threads, but targets
must stop all threads in any already-attached processes when entering
all-stop mode.  <small>GDB</small> uses the ‘<samp>?</samp>’ packet as necessary to
probe the target state after a mode change.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, when an attached process encounters an event that
would otherwise be reported with a stop reply, it uses the
asynchronous notification mechanism (see <a href="#Notification-Packets">Notification Packets</a>) to
inform <small>GDB</small>.  In contrast to all-stop mode, where all threads
in all processes are stopped when a stop reply is sent, in non-stop
mode only the thread reporting the stop event is stopped.  That is,
when reporting a ‘<samp>S</samp>’ or ‘<samp>T</samp>’ response to indicate completion
of a step operation, hitting a breakpoint, or a fault, only the
affected thread is stopped; any other still-running threads continue
to run.  When reporting a ‘<samp>W</samp>’ or ‘<samp>X</samp>’ response, all running
threads belonging to other attached processes continue to run.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, the target shall respond to the ‘<samp>?</samp>’ packet as
follows.  First, any incomplete stop reply notification/‘<samp>vStopped</samp>’ 
sequence in progress is abandoned.  The target must begin a new
sequence reporting stop events for all stopped threads, whether or not
it has previously reported those events to <small>GDB</small>.  The first
stop reply is sent as a synchronous reply to the ‘<samp>?</samp>’ packet, and
subsequent stop replies are sent as responses to ‘<samp>vStopped</samp>’ packets
using the mechanism described above.  The target must not send
asynchronous stop reply notifications until the sequence is complete.
If all threads are running when the target receives the ‘<samp>?</samp>’ packet,
or if the target is not attached to any process, it shall respond
‘<samp>OK</samp>’.
</p>
<p>If the stub supports non-stop mode, it should also support the
‘<samp>swbreak</samp>’ stop reason if software breakpoints are supported, and
the ‘<samp>hwbreak</samp>’ stop reason if hardware breakpoints are supported
(see <a href="#swbreak-stop-reason">swbreak stop reason</a>).  This is because given the asynchronous
nature of non-stop mode, between the time a thread hits a breakpoint
and the time the event is finally processed by <small>GDB</small>, the
breakpoint may have already been removed from the target.  Due to
this, <small>GDB</small> needs to be able to tell whether a trap stop was
caused by a delayed breakpoint event, which should be ignored, as
opposed to a random trap signal, which should be reported to the user.
Note the ‘<samp>swbreak</samp>’ feature implies that the target is responsible
for adjusting the PC when a software breakpoint triggers, if
necessary, such as on the x86 architecture.

<h3>E.11 Packet Acknowledgment</h3>

<a name="index-acknowledgment_002c-for-GDB-remote"></a>
<a name="index-packet-acknowledgment_002c-for-GDB-remote"></a>
<p>By default, when either the host or the target machine receives a packet,
the first response expected is an acknowledgment: either ‘<samp>+</samp>’ (to indicate
the package was received correctly) or ‘<samp>-</samp>’ (to request retransmission).
This mechanism allows the <small>GDB</small> remote protocol to operate over
unreliable transport mechanisms, such as a serial line.
</p>
<p>In cases where the transport mechanism is itself reliable (such as a pipe or
TCP connection), the ‘<samp>+</samp>’/‘<samp>-</samp>’ acknowledgments are redundant.
It may be desirable to disable them in that case to reduce communication
overhead, or for other reasons.  This can be accomplished by means of the
‘<samp>QStartNoAckMode</samp>’ packet; see <a href="#QStartNoAckMode">QStartNoAckMode</a>.
</p>
<p>When in no-acknowledgment mode, neither the stub nor <small>GDB</small> shall send or
expect ‘<samp>+</samp>’/‘<samp>-</samp>’ protocol acknowledgments.  The packet
and response format still includes the normal checksum, as described in
<a href="#Overview">Overview</a>, but the checksum may be ignored by the receiver.
</p>
<p>If the stub supports ‘<samp>QStartNoAckMode</samp>’ and prefers to operate in
no-acknowledgment mode, it should report that to <small>GDB</small>
by including ‘<samp>QStartNoAckMode+</samp>’ in its response to ‘<samp>qSupported</samp>’;
see <a href="#qSupported">qSupported</a>.
If <small>GDB</small> also supports ‘<samp>QStartNoAckMode</samp>’ and it has not been
disabled via the <code>set remote noack-packet off</code> command
(see <a href="#Remote-Configuration">Remote Configuration</a>),
<small>GDB</small> may then send a ‘<samp>QStartNoAckMode</samp>’ packet to the stub.
Only then may the stub actually turn off packet acknowledgments.
<small>GDB</small> sends a final ‘<samp>+</samp>’ acknowledgment of the stub’s ‘<samp>OK</samp>’
response, which can be safely ignored by the stub.
</p>
<p>Note that <code>set remote noack-packet</code> command only affects negotiation
between <small>GDB</small> and the stub when subsequent connections are made;
it does not affect the protocol acknowledgment state for any current
connection.
Since ‘<samp>+</samp>’/‘<samp>-</samp>’ acknowledgments are enabled by default when a
new connection is established,
there is also no protocol request to re-enable the acknowledgments
for the current connection, once disabled.

<h4>E.13.1 File-I/O Overview</h4>
<a name="index-file_002di_002fo-overview"></a>

<p>The <em>File I/O remote protocol extension</em> (short: File-I/O) allows the
target to use the host’s file system and console I/O to perform various
system calls.  System calls on the target system are translated into a
remote protocol packet to the host system, which then performs the needed
actions and returns a response packet to the target system.
This simulates file system operations even on targets that lack file systems.
</p>
<p>The protocol is defined to be independent of both the host and target systems.
It uses its own internal representation of datatypes and values.  Both
<small>GDB</small> and the target’s <small>GDB</small> stub are responsible for
translating the system-dependent value representations into the internal
protocol representations when data is transmitted.
</p>
<p>The communication is synchronous.  A system call is possible only when 
<small>GDB</small> is waiting for a response from the ‘<samp>C</samp>’, ‘<samp>c</samp>’, ‘<samp>S</samp>’ 
or ‘<samp>s</samp>’ packets.  While <small>GDB</small> handles the request for a system call,
the target is stopped to allow deterministic access to the target’s
memory.  Therefore File-I/O is not interruptible by target signals.  On
the other hand, it is possible to interrupt File-I/O by a user interrupt 
(‘<samp>Ctrl-C</samp>’) within <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
<p>The target’s request to perform a host system call does not finish
the latest ‘<samp>C</samp>’, ‘<samp>c</samp>’, ‘<samp>S</samp>’ or ‘<samp>s</samp>’ action.  That means,
after finishing the system call, the target returns to continuing the
previous activity (continue, step).  No additional continue or step
request from <small>GDB</small> is required.
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) continue
  &lt;- target requests &#39;system call X&#39;
  target is stopped, GDB executes system call
  -&gt; GDB returns result
  ... target continues, GDB returns to wait for the target
  &lt;- target hits breakpoint and sends a Txx packet
</pre></div>

<p>The protocol only supports I/O on the console and to regular files on 
the host file system.  Character or block special devices, pipes,
named pipes, sockets or any other communication method on the host
system are not supported by this protocol.
</p>
<p>File I/O is not supported in non-stop mode.

<h4>E.13.2 Protocol Basics</h4>
<a name="index-protocol-basics_002c-file_002di_002fo"></a>

<p>The File-I/O protocol uses the <code>F</code> packet as the request as well
as reply packet.  Since a File-I/O system call can only occur when
<small>GDB</small> is waiting for a response from the continuing or stepping target, 
the File-I/O request is a reply that <small>GDB</small> has to expect as a result
of a previous ‘<samp>C</samp>’, ‘<samp>c</samp>’, ‘<samp>S</samp>’ or ‘<samp>s</samp>’ packet.
This <code>F</code> packet contains all information needed to allow <small>GDB</small>
to call the appropriate host system call:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A unique identifier for the requested system call.

</li><li> All parameters to the system call.  Pointers are given as addresses
in the target memory address space.  Pointers to strings are given as
pointer/length pair.  Numerical values are given as they are.
Numerical control flags are given in a protocol-specific representation.

</li></ul>

<p>At this point, <small>GDB</small> has to perform the following actions.
</p>
<ul>
<li> If the parameters include pointer values to data needed as input to a 
system call, <small>GDB</small> requests this data from the target with a
standard <code>m</code> packet request.  This additional communication has to be
expected by the target implementation and is handled as any other <code>m</code>
packet.

</li><li> <small>GDB</small> translates all value from protocol representation to host
representation as needed.  Datatypes are coerced into the host types.

</li><li> <small>GDB</small> calls the system call.

</li><li> It then coerces datatypes back to protocol representation.

</li><li> If the system call is expected to return data in buffer space specified
by pointer parameters to the call, the data is transmitted to the
target using a <code>M</code> or <code>X</code> packet.  This packet has to be expected
by the target implementation and is handled as any other <code>M</code> or <code>X</code>
packet.

</li></ul>

<p>Eventually <small>GDB</small> replies with another <code>F</code> packet which contains all
necessary information for the target to continue.  This at least contains
</p>
<ul>
<li> Return value.

</li><li> <code>errno</code>, if has been changed by the system call.

</li><li> “Ctrl-C” flag.

</li></ul>

<p>After having done the needed type and value coercion, the target continues
the latest continue or step action.

of scalar datatypes, pointers to target buffer space in case of compound
datatypes and unspecified memory areas, or pointer/length pairs in case
of string parameters.  These are appended to the <var>call-id</var> as a 
comma-delimited list.  All values are transmitted in ASCII

<dl compact="compact">
<dt>‘<samp>F<var>retcode</var>,<var>errno</var>,<var>Ctrl-C flag</var>;<var>call-specific attachment</var></samp>’</dt>

<p><var>errno</var> is the <code>errno</code> set by the call, in protocol-specific
representation.
This parameter can be omitted if the call was successful.
</p>
<p><var>Ctrl-C flag</var> is only sent if the user requested a break.  In this
case, <var>errno</var> must be sent as well, even if the call was successful.

<h4>E.13.5 The ‘<samp>Ctrl-C</samp>’ Message</h4>
<a name="index-ctrl_002dc-message_002c-in-file_002di_002fo-protocol"></a>

<p>If the ‘<samp>Ctrl-C</samp>’ flag is set in the <small>GDB</small>
reply packet (see <a href="#The-F-Reply-Packet">The F Reply Packet</a>),
the target should behave as if it had
gotten a break message.  The meaning for the target is “system call
interrupted by <code>SIGINT</code>”.  Consequentially, the target should actually stop
(as with a break message) and return to <small>GDB</small> with a <code>T02</code>
packet.
</p>
<p>It’s important for the target to know in which
state the system call was interrupted.  There are two possible cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The system call hasn’t been performed on the host yet.

</li><li> The system call on the host has been finished.

</li></ul>

<p>These two states can be distinguished by the target by the value of the
returned <code>errno</code>.  If it’s the protocol representation of <code>EINTR</code>, the system
call hasn’t been performed.  This is equivalent to the <code>EINTR</code> handling
on POSIX systems.  In any other case, the target may presume that the
system call has been finished — successfully or not — and should behave
as if the break message arrived right after the system call.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> must behave reliably.  If the system call has not been called
yet, <small>GDB</small> may send the <code>F</code> reply immediately, setting <code>EINTR</code> as
<code>errno</code> in the packet.  If the system call on the host has been finished
before the user requests a break, the full action must be finished by
<small>GDB</small>.  This requires sending <code>M</code> or <code>X</code> packets as necessary.
The <code>F</code> packet may only be sent when either nothing has happened
or the full action has been completed.

<h4>E.13.6 Console I/O</h4>
<a name="index-console-i_002fo-as-part-of-file_002di_002fo"></a>

<p>By default and if not explicitly closed by the target system, the file
descriptors 0, 1 and 2 are connected to the <small>GDB</small> console.  Output
on the <small>GDB</small> console is handled as any other file output operation
(<code>write(1, …)</code> or <code>write(2, …)</code>).  Console input is handled
by <small>GDB</small> so that after the target read request from file descriptor
0 all following typing is buffered until either one of the following
conditions is met:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The user types <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd>.  The behaviour is as explained above, and the
<code>read</code>
system call is treated as finished.

</li><li> The user presses <tt>RET</tt>.  This is treated as end of input with a trailing
newline.

</li><li> The user types <kbd>Ctrl-d</kbd>.  This is treated as end of input.  No trailing
character (neither newline nor ‘<samp>Ctrl-D</samp>’) is appended to the input.

</li></ul>

<p>If the user has typed more characters than fit in the buffer given to
the <code>read</code> call, the trailing characters are buffered in <small>GDB</small> until
either another <code>read(0, …)</code> is requested by the target, or debugging
is stopped at the user’s request.

<h4>Integral Datatypes</h4>
<a name="index-integral-datatypes_002c-in-file_002di_002fo-protocol"></a>

<p>The integral datatypes used in the system calls are <code>int</code>, 
<code>unsigned int</code>, <code>long</code>, <code>unsigned long</code>,
<code>mode_t</code>, and <code>time_t</code>.  
</p>
<p><code>int</code>, <code>unsigned int</code>, <code>mode_t</code> and <code>time_t</code> are
implemented as 32 bit values in this protocol.
</p>
<p><code>long</code> and <code>unsigned long</code> are implemented as 64 bit types.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Limits">Limits</a>, for corresponding MIN and MAX values (similar to those
in <samp>limits.h</samp>) to allow range checking on host and target.
</p>
<p><code>time_t</code> datatypes are defined as seconds since the Epoch.
</p>
<p>All integral datatypes transferred as part of a memory read or write of a
structured datatype e.g. a <code>struct stat</code> have to be given in big endian
byte order.

<h4>Pointer Values</h4>

<p>Pointers to target data are transmitted as they are.  An exception
is made for pointers to buffers for which the length isn’t
transmitted as part of the function call, namely strings.  Strings
are transmitted as a pointer/length pair, both as hex values, e.g.
</p>


<p>which is a pointer to data of length 18 bytes at position 0x1aaf.
The length is defined as the full string length in bytes, including
the trailing null byte.  For example, the string <code>&#34;hello world&#34;</code>
at address 0x123456 is transmitted as

<h4>Memory Transfer</h4>

<p>Structured data which is transferred using a memory read or write (for
example, a <code>struct stat</code>) is expected to be in a protocol-specific format 
with all scalar multibyte datatypes being big endian.  Translation to
this representation needs to be done both by the target before the <code>F</code> 
packet is sent, and by <small>GDB</small> before 
it transfers memory to the target.  Transferred pointers to structured
data should point to the already-coerced data at any time.

through memory operations, so it uses the ‘<samp>qXfer:libraries:read</samp>’
packet (see <a href="#qXfer-library-list-read">qXfer library list read</a>) instead.  The remote stub
queries the target’s operating system and reports which libraries
are loaded.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>qXfer:libraries:read</samp>’ packet returns an XML document which
lists loaded libraries and their offsets.  Each library has an
associated name and one or more segment or section base addresses,
which report where the library was loaded in memory.
</p>
<p>For the common case of libraries that are fully linked binaries, the
library should have a list of segments.  If the target supports
dynamic linking of a relocatable object file, its library XML element
should instead include a list of allocated sections.  The segment or
section bases are start addresses, not relocation offsets; they do not
depend on the library’s link-time base addresses.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> must be linked with the Expat library to support XML
library lists.  See <a href="#Expat">Expat</a>.
</p>
<p>A simple memory map, with one loaded library relocated by a single
offset, looks like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;library-list&gt;
  &lt;library name=&#34;/lib/libc.so.6&#34;&gt;
    &lt;segment address=&#34;0x10000000&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;/library&gt;
&lt;/library-list&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Another simple memory map, with one loaded library with three
allocated sections (.text, .data, .bss), looks like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;library-list&gt;
  &lt;library name=&#34;sharedlib.o&#34;&gt;
    &lt;section address=&#34;0x10000000&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;section address=&#34;0x20000000&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;section address=&#34;0x30000000&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;/library&gt;
&lt;/library-list&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The format of a library list is described by this DTD:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;!-- library-list: Root element with versioning --&gt;
&lt;!ELEMENT library-list  (library)*&gt;
&lt;!ATTLIST library-list  version CDATA   #FIXED  &#34;1.0&#34;&gt;

</pre></div>

<p>In addition, segments and section descriptors cannot be mixed within a

<h3>E.15 Library List Format for SVR4 Targets</h3>
<a name="index-library-list-format_002c-remote-protocol-1"></a>

<p>On SVR4 platforms <small>GDB</small> can use the symbol table of a dynamic loader
(e.g. <samp>ld.so</samp>) and normal memory operations to maintain a list of
shared libraries.  Still a special library list provided by this packet is
more efficient for the <small>GDB</small> remote protocol.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>qXfer:libraries-svr4:read</samp>’ packet returns an XML document which lists
loaded libraries and their SVR4 linker parameters.  For each library on SVR4
target, the following parameters are reported:
</p>
<ul>
<li>- <code>name</code>, the absolute file name from the <code>l_name</code> field of
<code>struct link_map</code>.
</li><li>- <code>lm</code> with address of <code>struct link_map</code> used for TLS
(Thread Local Storage) access.
</li><li>- <code>l_addr</code>, the displacement as read from the field <code>l_addr</code> of
<code>struct link_map</code>.  For prelinked libraries this is not an absolute
memory address.  It is a displacement of absolute memory address against
address the file was prelinked to during the library load.
</li><li>- <code>l_ld</code>, which is memory address of the <code>PT_DYNAMIC</code> segment
</li></ul>

<p>Additionally the single <code>main-lm</code> attribute specifies address of
<code>struct link_map</code> used for the main executable.  This parameter is used
for TLS access and its presence is optional.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> must be linked with the Expat library to support XML
SVR4 library lists.  See <a href="#Expat">Expat</a>.
</p>
<p>A simple memory map, with two loaded libraries (which do not use prelink),
looks like this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;library-list-svr4 version=&#34;1.0&#34; main-lm=&#34;0xe4f8f8&#34;&gt;

<h3>E.16 Memory Map Format</h3>
<a name="index-memory-map-format"></a>

<p>To be able to write into flash memory, <small>GDB</small> needs to obtain a
memory map from the target.  This section describes the format of the
memory map.
</p>
<p>The memory map is obtained using the ‘<samp>qXfer:memory-map:read</samp>’
(see <a href="#qXfer-memory-map-read">qXfer memory map read</a>) packet and is an XML document that
lists memory regions.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> must be linked with the Expat library to support XML
memory maps.  See <a href="#Expat">Expat</a>.
</p>
<p>The top-level structure of the document is shown below:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE memory-map
          PUBLIC &#34;+//IDN gnu.org//DTD GDB Memory Map V1.0//EN&#34;
                 &#34;http://sourceware.org/gdb/gdb-memory-map.dtd&#34;&gt;
&lt;memory-map&gt;
    region...
&lt;/memory-map&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Each region can be either:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A region of RAM starting at <var>addr</var> and extending for <var>length</var>
bytes from there:

<div>
<pre>&lt;memory type=&#34;ram&#34; start=&#34;<var>addr</var>&#34; length=&#34;<var>length</var>&#34;/&gt;
</pre></div>


</li><li> A region of read-only memory:

<div>
<pre>&lt;memory type=&#34;rom&#34; start=&#34;<var>addr</var>&#34; length=&#34;<var>length</var>&#34;/&gt;
</pre></div>


</li><li> A region of flash memory, with erasure blocks <var>blocksize</var>
bytes in length:

<div>
<pre>&lt;memory type=&#34;flash&#34; start=&#34;<var>addr</var>&#34; length=&#34;<var>length</var>&#34;&gt;
  &lt;property name=&#34;blocksize&#34;&gt;<var>blocksize</var>&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/memory&gt;
</pre></div>

</li></ul>

<p>Regions must not overlap.  <small>GDB</small> assumes that areas of memory not covered
by the memory map are RAM, and uses the ordinary ‘<samp>M</samp>’ and ‘<samp>X</samp>’
packets to write to addresses in such ranges.

</pre></div>

<p>Each ‘<samp>thread</samp>’ element must have the ‘<samp>id</samp>’ attribute that
identifies the thread (see <a href="#thread_002did-syntax">thread-id syntax</a>).  The
‘<samp>core</samp>’ attribute, if present, specifies which processor core
the thread was last executing on.  The ‘<samp>name</samp>’ attribute, if
present, specifies the human-readable name of the thread.  The content
of the of ‘<samp>thread</samp>’ element is interpreted as human-readable
auxiliary information.  The ‘<samp>handle</samp>’ attribute, if present,
is a hex encoded representation of the thread handle.

<a name="The-GDB-Agent-Expression-Mechanism"></a>
<h2>Appendix F The GDB Agent Expression Mechanism</h2>

<p>In some applications, it is not feasible for the debugger to interrupt
the program’s execution long enough for the developer to learn anything
helpful about its behavior.  If the program’s correctness depends on its
real-time behavior, delays introduced by a debugger might cause the
program to fail, even when the code itself is correct.  It is useful to
be able to observe the program’s behavior without interrupting it.
</p>
<p>Using GDB’s <code>trace</code> and <code>collect</code> commands, the user can
specify locations in the program, and arbitrary expressions to evaluate
when those locations are reached.  Later, using the <code>tfind</code>
command, she can examine the values those expressions had when the
program hit the trace points.  The expressions may also denote objects
in memory — structures or arrays, for example — whose values GDB
should record; while visiting a particular tracepoint, the user may
inspect those objects as if they were in memory at that moment.
However, because GDB records these values without interacting with the
user, it can do so quickly and unobtrusively, hopefully not disturbing
the program’s behavior.
</p>
<p>When GDB is debugging a remote target, the GDB <em>agent</em> code running
on the target computes the values of the expressions itself.  To avoid
having a full symbolic expression evaluator on the agent, GDB translates
expressions in the source language into a simpler bytecode language, and
then sends the bytecode to the agent; the agent then executes the
bytecode, and records the values for GDB to retrieve later.
</p>
<p>The bytecode language is simple; there are forty-odd opcodes, the bulk
of which are the usual vocabulary of C operands (addition, subtraction,
shifts, and so on) and various sizes of literals and memory reference
operations.  The bytecode interpreter operates strictly on machine-level
values — various sizes of integers and floating point numbers — and
requires no information about types or symbols; thus, the interpreter’s
internal data structures are simple, and each bytecode requires only a
few native machine instructions to implement it.  The interpreter is
small, and strict limits on the memory and time required to evaluate an
expression are easy to determine, making it suitable for use by the
debugging agent in real-time applications.
</p>





<hr/>
<a name="General-Bytecode-Design"></a>

<a name="General-Bytecode-Design-1"></a>
<h3>F.1 General Bytecode Design</h3>

<p>The agent represents bytecode expressions as an array of bytes.  Each
instruction is one byte long (thus the term <em>bytecode</em>).  Some
instructions are followed by operand bytes; for example, the <code>goto</code>
instruction is followed by a destination for the jump.
</p>
<p>The bytecode interpreter is a stack-based machine; most instructions pop
their operands off the stack, perform some operation, and push the
result back on the stack for the next instruction to consume.  Each
element of the stack may contain either a integer or a floating point
value; these values are as many bits wide as the largest integer that
can be directly manipulated in the source language.  Stack elements
carry no record of their type; bytecode could push a value as an
integer, then pop it as a floating point value.  However, GDB will not
generate code which does this.  In C, one might define the type of a
stack element as follows:
</p><div>
<pre>union agent_val {
  LONGEST l;
  DOUBLEST d;
};
</pre></div>
<p>where <code>LONGEST</code> and <code>DOUBLEST</code> are <code>typedef</code> names for
the largest integer and floating point types on the machine.
</p>
<p>By the time the bytecode interpreter reaches the end of the expression,
the value of the expression should be the only value left on the stack.
For tracing applications, <code>trace</code> bytecodes in the expression will
have recorded the necessary data, and the value on the stack may be
discarded.  For other applications, like conditional breakpoints, the
value may be useful.
</p>
<p>Separate from the stack, the interpreter has two registers:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>pc</code></dt>
<dd><p>The address of the next bytecode to execute.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>start</code></dt>
<dd><p>The address of the start of the bytecode expression, necessary for
interpreting the <code>goto</code> and <code>if_goto</code> instructions.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Neither of these registers is directly visible to the bytecode language
itself, but they are useful for defining the meanings of the bytecode
operations.
</p>
<p>There are no instructions to perform side effects on the running
program, or call the program’s functions; we assume that these
expressions are only used for unobtrusive debugging, not for patching
the running code.  
</p>
<p>Most bytecode instructions do not distinguish between the various sizes
of values, and operate on full-width values; the upper bits of the
values are simply ignored, since they do not usually make a difference
to the value computed.  The exceptions to this rule are:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt>memory reference instructions (<code>ref</code><var>n</var>)</dt>
<dd><p>There are distinct instructions to fetch different word sizes from
memory.  Once on the stack, however, the values are treated as full-size
integers.  They may need to be sign-extended; the <code>ext</code> instruction
exists for this purpose.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>the sign-extension instruction (<code>ext</code> <var>n</var>)</dt>
<dd><p>These clearly need to know which portion of their operand is to be
extended to occupy the full length of the word.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>If the interpreter is unable to evaluate an expression completely for
some reason (a memory location is inaccessible, or a divisor is zero,
for example), we say that interpretation “terminates with an error”.
This means that the problem is reported back to the interpreter’s caller
in some helpful way.  In general, code using agent expressions should
assume that they may attempt to divide by zero, fetch arbitrary memory
locations, and misbehave in other ways.
</p>
<p>Even complicated C expressions compile to a few bytecode instructions;
for example, the expression <code>x + y * z</code> would typically produce
code like the following, assuming that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> live in
registers, and <code>z</code> is a global variable holding a 32-bit
<code>int</code>:
</p><div>
<pre>reg 1
reg 2
const32 <i>address of z</i>
ref32
ext 32
mul
add
end
</pre></div>

<p>In detail, these mean:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>reg 1</code></dt>
<dd><p>Push the value of register 1 (presumably holding <code>x</code>) onto the
stack.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>reg 2</code></dt>
<dd><p>Push the value of register 2 (holding <code>y</code>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>const32 <i>address of z</i></code></dt>
<dd><p>Push the address of <code>z</code> onto the stack.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ref32</code></dt>
<dd><p>Fetch a 32-bit word from the address at the top of the stack; replace
the address on the stack with the value.  Thus, we replace the address
of <code>z</code> with <code>z</code>’s value.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ext 32</code></dt>
<dd><p>Sign-extend the value on the top of the stack from 32 bits to full
length.  This is necessary because <code>z</code> is a signed integer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>mul</code></dt>
<dd><p>Pop the top two numbers on the stack, multiply them, and push their
product.  Now the top of the stack contains the value of the expression
<code>y * z</code>.
</p>

<h3>F.2 Bytecode Descriptions</h3>

<p>Each bytecode description has the following form:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>add</code> (0x02): <var>a</var> <var>b</var> ⇒ <var>a+b</var></dt>
<dd>
<p>Pop the top two stack items, <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>, as integers; push
their sum, as an integer.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>In this example, <code>add</code> is the name of the bytecode, and
<code>(0x02)</code> is the one-byte value used to encode the bytecode, in
hexadecimal.  The phrase “<var>a</var> <var>b</var> ⇒ <var>a+b</var>” shows
the stack before and after the bytecode executes.  Beforehand, the stack
must contain at least two values, <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>; since the top of
the stack is to the right, <var>b</var> is on the top of the stack, and
<var>a</var> is underneath it.  After execution, the bytecode will have
popped <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> from the stack, and replaced them with a
single value, <var>a+b</var>.  There may be other values on the stack below
those shown, but the bytecode affects only those shown.
</p>
<p>Here is another example:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>const8</code> (0x22) <var>n</var>: ⇒ <var>n</var></dt>
<dd><p>Push the 8-bit integer constant <var>n</var> on the stack, without sign
extension.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>In this example, the bytecode <code>const8</code> takes an operand <var>n</var>
directly from the bytecode stream; the operand follows the <code>const8</code>
bytecode itself.  We write any such operands immediately after the name
of the bytecode, before the colon, and describe the exact encoding of
the operand in the bytecode stream in the body of the bytecode
description.
</p>
<p>For the <code>const8</code> bytecode, there are no stack items given before
the ⇒; this simply means that the bytecode consumes no values
from the stack.  If a bytecode consumes no values, or produces no
values, the list on either side of the ⇒ may be empty.
</p>
<p>If a value is written as <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, or <var>n</var>, then the bytecode
treats it as an integer.  If a value is written is <var>addr</var>, then the
bytecode treats it as an address.
</p>
<p>We do not fully describe the floating point operations here; although
this design can be extended in a clean way to handle floating point
values, they are not of immediate interest to the customer, so we avoid
describing them, to save time.

<h3>F.3 Using Agent Expressions</h3>

<p>Agent expressions can be used in several different ways by <small>GDB</small>,
and the debugger can generate different bytecode sequences as appropriate.
</p>
<p>One possibility is to do expression evaluation on the target rather
than the host, such as for the conditional of a conditional
tracepoint.  In such a case, <small>GDB</small> compiles the source
expression into a bytecode sequence that simply gets values from
registers or memory, does arithmetic, and returns a result.
</p>
<p>Another way to use agent expressions is for tracepoint data
collection.  <small>GDB</small> generates a different bytecode sequence for
collection; in addition to bytecodes that do the calculation,
<small>GDB</small> adds <code>trace</code> bytecodes to save the pieces of
memory that were used.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The user selects trace points in the program’s code at which GDB should
collect data.

</li><li> The user specifies expressions to evaluate at each trace point.  These
expressions may denote objects in memory, in which case those objects’
contents are recorded as the program runs, or computed values, in which
case the values themselves are recorded.

</li><li> GDB transmits the tracepoints and their associated expressions to the
GDB agent, running on the debugging target.

</li><li> The agent arranges to be notified when a trace point is hit.

</li><li> When execution on the target reaches a trace point, the agent evaluates
the expressions associated with that trace point, and records the
resulting values and memory ranges.

</li><li> Later, when the user selects a given trace event and inspects the
objects and expression values recorded, GDB talks to the agent to
retrieve recorded data as necessary to meet the user’s requests.  If the
user asks to see an object whose contents have not been recorded, GDB
reports an error.

</li></ul>

<h3>F.4 Varying Target Capabilities</h3>

<p>Some targets don’t support floating-point, and some would rather not
have to deal with <code>long long</code> operations.  Also, different targets
will have different stack sizes, and different bytecode buffer lengths.
</p>
<p>Thus, GDB needs a way to ask the target about itself.  We haven’t worked
out the details yet, but in general, GDB should be able to send the
target a packet asking it to describe itself.  The reply should be a
packet whose length is explicit, so we can add new information to the
packet in future revisions of the agent, without confusing old versions
of GDB, and it should contain a version number.  It should contain at
least the following information:
</p>
<ul>
<li> whether floating point is supported

</li><li> whether <code>long long</code> is supported

</li><li> maximum acceptable size of bytecode stack

</li><li> maximum acceptable length of bytecode expressions

</li><li> which registers are actually available for collection

</li><li> whether the target supports disabled tracepoints

</li></ul>

<a name="Rationale"></a>

<a name="Rationale-1"></a>
<h3>F.5 Rationale</h3>

<p>Some of the design decisions apparent above are arguable.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><b>What about stack overflow/underflow?</b></dt>
<dd><p>GDB should be able to query the target to discover its stack size.
Given that information, GDB can determine at translation time whether a
given expression will overflow the stack.  But this spec isn’t about
what kinds of error-checking GDB ought to do.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why are you doing everything in LONGEST?</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Speed isn’t important, but agent code size is; using LONGEST brings in a
bunch of support code to do things like division, etc.  So this is a
serious concern.
</p>
<p>First, note that you don’t need different bytecodes for different
operand sizes.  You can generate code without <em>knowing</em> how big the
stack elements actually are on the target.  If the target only supports
32-bit ints, and you don’t send any 64-bit bytecodes, everything just
works.  The observation here is that the MIPS and the Alpha have only
fixed-size registers, and you can still get C’s semantics even though
most instructions only operate on full-sized words.  You just need to
make sure everything is properly sign-extended at the right times.  So
there is no need for 32- and 64-bit variants of the bytecodes.  Just
implement everything using the largest size you support.
</p>
<p>GDB should certainly check to see what sizes the target supports, so the
user can get an error earlier, rather than later.  But this information
is not necessary for correctness.
</p>

</dd>
<dt><b>Why don’t you have <code>&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;=</code> operators?</b></dt>
<dd><p>I want to keep the interpreter small, and we don’t need them.  We can
combine the <code>less_</code> opcodes with <code>log_not</code>, and swap the order
of the operands, yielding all four asymmetrical comparison operators.
For example, <code>(x &lt;= y)</code> is <code>! (x &gt; y)</code>, which is <code>! (y &lt;
x)</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why do you have <code>log_not</code>?</b></dt>
<dt><b>Why do you have <code>ext</code>?</b></dt>
<dt><b>Why do you have <code>zero_ext</code>?</b></dt>
<dd><p>These are all easily synthesized from other instructions, but I expect
them to be used frequently, and they’re simple, so I include them to
keep bytecode strings short.
</p>
<p><code>log_not</code> is equivalent to <code>const8 0 equal</code>; it’s used in half
the relational operators.
</p>
<p><code>ext <var>n</var></code> is equivalent to <code>const8 <var>s-n</var> lsh const8
<var>s-n</var> rsh_signed</code>, where <var>s</var> is the size of the stack elements;
it follows <code>ref<var>m</var></code> and <var>reg</var> bytecodes when the value
should be signed.  See the next bulleted item.
</p>
<p><code>zero_ext <var>n</var></code> is equivalent to <code>const<var>m</var> <var>mask</var>
log_and</code>; it’s used whenever we push the value of a register, because we
can’t assume the upper bits of the register aren’t garbage.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why not have sign-extending variants of the <code>ref</code> operators?</b></dt>
<dd><p>Because that would double the number of <code>ref</code> operators, and we
need the <code>ext</code> bytecode anyway for accessing bitfields.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why not have constant-address variants of the <code>ref</code> operators?</b></dt>
<dd><p>Because that would double the number of <code>ref</code> operators again, and
<code>const32 <var>address</var> ref32</code> is only one byte longer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why do the <code>ref<var>n</var></code> operators have to support unaligned fetches?</b></dt>
<dd><p>GDB will generate bytecode that fetches multi-byte values at unaligned
addresses whenever the executable’s debugging information tells it to.
Furthermore, GDB does not know the value the pointer will have when GDB
generates the bytecode, so it cannot determine whether a particular
fetch will be aligned or not.
</p>
<p>In particular, structure bitfields may be several bytes long, but follow
no alignment rules; members of packed structures are not necessarily
aligned either.
</p>
<p>In general, there are many cases where unaligned references occur in
correct C code, either at the programmer’s explicit request, or at the
compiler’s discretion.  Thus, it is simpler to make the GDB agent
bytecodes work correctly in all circumstances than to make GDB guess in
each case whether the compiler did the usual thing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why are there no side-effecting operators?</b></dt>
<dd><p>Because our current client doesn’t want them?  That’s a cheap answer.  I
think the real answer is that I’m afraid of implementing function
calls.  We should re-visit this issue after the present contract is
delivered.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why aren’t the <code>goto</code> ops PC-relative?</b></dt>
<dd><p>The interpreter has the base address around anyway for PC bounds
checking, and it seemed simpler.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why is there only one offset size for the <code>goto</code> ops?</b></dt>
<dd><p>Offsets are currently sixteen bits.  I’m not happy with this situation
either:
</p>
<p>Suppose we have multiple branch ops with different offset sizes.  As I
generate code left-to-right, all my jumps are forward jumps (there are
no loops in expressions), so I never know the target when I emit the
jump opcode.  Thus, I have to either always assume the largest offset
size, or do jump relaxation on the code after I generate it, which seems
like a big waste of time.
</p>
<p>I can imagine a reasonable expression being longer than 256 bytes.  I
can’t imagine one being longer than 64k.  Thus, we need 16-bit offsets.
This kind of reasoning is so bogus, but relaxation is pathetic.
</p>
<p>The other approach would be to generate code right-to-left.  Then I’d
always know my offset size.  That might be fun.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Where is the function call bytecode?</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>When we add side-effects, we should add this.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why does the <code>reg</code> bytecode take a 16-bit register number?</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>Intel’s IA-64 architecture has 128 general-purpose registers,
and 128 floating-point registers, and I’m sure it has some random
control registers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why do we need <code>trace</code> and <code>trace_quick</code>?</b></dt>
<dd><p>Because GDB needs to record all the memory contents and registers an
expression touches.  If the user wants to evaluate an expression
<code>x-&gt;y-&gt;z</code>, the agent must record the values of <code>x</code> and
<code>x-&gt;y</code> as well as the value of <code>x-&gt;y-&gt;z</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Don’t the <code>trace</code> bytecodes make the interpreter less general?</b></dt>
<dd><p>They do mean that the interpreter contains special-purpose code, but
that doesn’t mean the interpreter can only be used for that purpose.  If
an expression doesn’t use the <code>trace</code> bytecodes, they don’t get in
its way.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why doesn’t <code>trace_quick</code> consume its arguments the way everything else does?</b></dt>
<dd><p>In general, you do want your operators to consume their arguments; it’s
consistent, and generally reduces the amount of stack rearrangement
necessary.  However, <code>trace_quick</code> is a kludge to save space; it
only exists so we needn’t write <code>dup const8 <var>SIZE</var> trace</code>
before every memory reference.  Therefore, it’s okay for it not to
consume its arguments; it’s meant for a specific context in which we
know exactly what it should do with the stack.  If we’re going to have a
kludge, it should be an effective kludge.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b>Why does <code>trace16</code> exist?</b></dt>
<dd><p>That opcode was added by the customer that contracted Cygnus for the
data tracing work.  I personally think it is unnecessary; objects that
large will be quite rare, so it is okay to use <code>dup const16
<var>size</var> trace</code> in those cases.
</p>
<p>Whatever we decide to do with <code>trace16</code>, we should at least leave
opcode 0x30 reserved, to remain compatible with the customer who added
it.

<h2>Appendix G Target Descriptions</h2>
<a name="index-target-descriptions"></a>

<p>One of the challenges of using <small>GDB</small> to debug embedded systems
is that there are so many minor variants of each processor
architecture in use.  It is common practice for vendors to start with
a standard processor core — ARM, PowerPC, or <acronym>MIPS</acronym>, for example —
and then make changes to adapt it to a particular market niche.  Some
architectures have hundreds of variants, available from dozens of
vendors.  This leads to a number of problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li> With so many different customized processors, it is difficult for
the <small>GDB</small> maintainers to keep up with the changes.
</li><li> Since individual variants may have short lifetimes or limited
audiences, it may not be worthwhile to carry information about every
variant in the <small>GDB</small> source tree.
</li><li> When <small>GDB</small> does support the architecture of the embedded system
at hand, the task of finding the correct architecture name to give the
<code>set architecture</code> command can be error-prone.
</li></ul>

<p>To address these problems, the <small>GDB</small> remote protocol allows a
target system to not only identify itself to <small>GDB</small>, but to
actually describe its own features.  This lets <small>GDB</small> support
processor variants it has never seen before — to the extent that the
descriptions are accurate, and that <small>GDB</small> understands them.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> must be linked with the Expat library to support XML
target descriptions.  See <a href="#Expat">Expat</a>.

<a name="Retrieving-Descriptions-1"></a>
<h3>G.1 Retrieving Descriptions</h3>

<p>Target descriptions can be read from the target automatically, or
specified by the user manually.  The default behavior is to read the
description from the target.  <small>GDB</small> retrieves it via the remote
protocol using ‘<samp>qXfer</samp>’ requests (see <a href="#General-Query-Packets">qXfer</a>).  The <var>annex</var> in the ‘<samp>qXfer</samp>’ packet will be
‘<samp>target.xml</samp>’.  The contents of the ‘<samp>target.xml</samp>’ annex are an
XML document, of the form described in <a href="#Target-Description-Format">Target Description Format</a>.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can specify a file to read for the target description.
If a file is set, the target will not be queried.  The commands to
specify a file are:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-set-tdesc-filename"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>set tdesc filename <var>path</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Read the target description from <var>path</var>.
</p>
<a name="index-unset-tdesc-filename"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>unset tdesc filename</code></dt>
<dd><p>Do not read the XML target description from a file.  <small>GDB</small>
will use the description supplied by the current target.
</p>
<a name="index-show-tdesc-filename"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>show tdesc filename</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show the filename to read for a target description, if any.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a name="Target-Description-Format"></a>

<a name="Target-Description-Format-1"></a>
<h3>G.2 Target Description Format</h3>
<a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-XML-format"></a>

<p>A target description annex is an <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>
document which complies with the Document Type Definition provided in
the <small>GDB</small> sources in <samp>gdb/features/gdb-target.dtd</samp>.  This
means you can use generally available tools like <code>xmllint</code> to
check that your feature descriptions are well-formed and valid.
However, to help people unfamiliar with XML write descriptions for
their targets, we also describe the grammar here.
</p>
<p>Target descriptions can identify the architecture of the remote target
and (for some architectures) provide information about custom register
sets.  They can also identify the OS ABI of the remote target.
<small>GDB</small> can use this information to autoconfigure for your
target, or to warn you if you connect to an unsupported target.
</p>
<p>Here is a simple target description:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;target version=&#34;1.0&#34;&gt;
  &lt;architecture&gt;i386:x86-64&lt;/architecture&gt;
&lt;/target&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>This minimal description only says that the target uses
the x86-64 architecture.
</p>
<p>A target description has the following overall form, with [ ] marking
optional elements and … marking repeatable elements.  The elements
are explained further below.
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE target SYSTEM &#34;gdb-target.dtd&#34;&gt;
&lt;target version=&#34;1.0&#34;&gt;
  <span>[</span><var>architecture</var><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><var>osabi</var><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><var>compatible</var><span>]</span>
  <span>[</span><var>feature</var>…<span>]</span>
&lt;/target&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The description is generally insensitive to whitespace and line
breaks, under the usual common-sense rules.  The XML version
declaration and document type declaration can generally be omitted
(<small>GDB</small> does not require them), but specifying them may be
useful for XML validation tools.  The ‘<samp>version</samp>’ attribute for
‘<samp>&lt;target&gt;</samp>’ may also be omitted, but we recommend
including it; if future versions of <small>GDB</small> use an incompatible
revision of <samp>gdb-target.dtd</samp>, they will detect and report
the version mismatch.
</p>
<a name="Inclusion"></a>
<h4>G.2.1 Inclusion</h4>
<a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-inclusion"></a>
<a name="index-XInclude"></a>
<a name="index-_003cxi_003ainclude_003e"></a>

<p>It can sometimes be valuable to split a target description up into
several different annexes, either for organizational purposes, or to
share files between different possible target descriptions.  You can
divide a description into multiple files by replacing any element of
the target description with an inclusion directive of the form:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;xi:include href=&#34;<var>document</var>&#34;/&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>When <small>GDB</small> encounters an element of this form, it will retrieve
the named XML <var>document</var>, and replace the inclusion directive with
the contents of that document.  If the current description was read
using ‘<samp>qXfer</samp>’, then so will be the included document;
<var>document</var> will be interpreted as the name of an annex.  If the
current description was read from a file, <small>GDB</small> will look for
<var>document</var> as a file in the same directory where it found the
original description.
</p>
<a name="Architecture"></a>
<h4>G.2.2 Architecture</h4>
<a name="index-_003carchitecture_003e"></a>

<p>An ‘<samp>&lt;architecture&gt;</samp>’ element has this form:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  &lt;architecture&gt;<var>arch</var>&lt;/architecture&gt;
</pre></div>

<p><var>arch</var> is one of the architectures from the set accepted by
<code>set architecture</code> (see <a href="#Targets">Specifying a Debugging Target</a>).
</p>
<a name="OS-ABI"></a>
<h4>G.2.3 OS ABI</h4>
<a name="index-_003cosabi_003e"></a>

<p>This optional field was introduced in <small>GDB</small> version 7.0.
Previous versions of <small>GDB</small> ignore it.
</p>
<p>An ‘<samp>&lt;osabi&gt;</samp>’ element has this form:
</p>


<p><var>abi-name</var> is an OS ABI name from the same selection accepted by
<code>set osabi</code><!-- /@w --> (see <a href="#ABI">Configuring the Current ABI</a>).
</p>
<a name="Compatible-Architecture"></a>
<h4>G.2.4 Compatible Architecture</h4>
<a name="index-_003ccompatible_003e"></a>

<p>This optional field was introduced in <small>GDB</small> version 7.0.
Previous versions of <small>GDB</small> ignore it.
</p>
<p>A ‘<samp>&lt;compatible&gt;</samp>’ element has this form:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  &lt;compatible&gt;<var>arch</var>&lt;/compatible&gt;
</pre></div>

<p><var>arch</var> is one of the architectures from the set accepted by
<code>set architecture</code> (see <a href="#Targets">Specifying a Debugging Target</a>).
</p>
<p>A ‘<samp>&lt;compatible&gt;</samp>’ element is used to specify that the target
is able to run binaries in some other than the main target architecture
given by the ‘<samp>&lt;architecture&gt;</samp>’ element.  For example, on the
Cell Broadband Engine, the main architecture is <code>powerpc:common</code>
or <code>powerpc:common64</code>, but the system is able to run binaries
in the <code>spu</code> architecture as well.  The way to describe this
capability with ‘<samp>&lt;compatible&gt;</samp>’ is as follows:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  &lt;architecture&gt;powerpc:common&lt;/architecture&gt;
  &lt;compatible&gt;spu&lt;/compatible&gt;
</pre></div>

<a name="Features"></a>
<h4>G.2.5 Features</h4>
<a name="index-_003cfeature_003e"></a>

<p>Each ‘<samp>&lt;feature&gt;</samp>’ describes some logical portion of the target
system.  Features are currently used to describe available CPU
registers and the types of their contents.  A ‘<samp>&lt;feature&gt;</samp>’ element
has this form:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;feature name=&#34;<var>name</var>&#34;&gt;
  <span>[</span><var>type</var>…<span>]</span>
  <var>reg</var>…
&lt;/feature&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Each feature’s name should be unique within the description.  The name
of a feature does not matter unless <small>GDB</small> has some special
knowledge of the contents of that feature; if it does, the feature
should have its standard name.  See <a href="#Standard-Target-Features">Standard Target Features</a>.
</p>
<a name="Types"></a>
<h4>G.2.6 Types</h4>

<p>Any register’s value is a collection of bits which <small>GDB</small> must
interpret.  The default interpretation is a two’s complement integer,
but other types can be requested by name in the register description.
Some predefined types are provided by <small>GDB</small> (see <a href="#Predefined-Target-Types">Predefined Target Types</a>), and the description can define additional composite
and enum types.
</p>
<p>Each type element must have an ‘<samp>id</samp>’ attribute, which gives
a unique (within the containing ‘<samp>&lt;feature&gt;</samp>’) name to the type.
Types must be defined before they are used.
</p>
<a name="index-_003cvector_003e"></a>
<p>Some targets offer vector registers, which can be treated as arrays
of scalar elements.  These types are written as ‘<samp>&lt;vector&gt;</samp>’ elements,
specifying the array element type, <var>type</var>, and the number of elements,
<var>count</var>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;vector id=&#34;<var>id</var>&#34; type=&#34;<var>type</var>&#34; count=&#34;<var>count</var>&#34;/&gt;
</pre></div>

<a name="index-_003cunion_003e"></a>
<p>If a register’s value is usefully viewed in multiple ways, define it
with a union type containing the useful representations.  The
‘<samp>&lt;union&gt;</samp>’ element contains one or more ‘<samp>&lt;field&gt;</samp>’ elements,
each of which has a <var>name</var> and a <var>type</var>:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;union id=&#34;<var>id</var>&#34;&gt;
  &lt;field name=&#34;<var>name</var>&#34; type=&#34;<var>type</var>&#34;/&gt;
  …
&lt;/union&gt;
</pre></div>

<a name="index-_003cstruct_003e"></a>
<a name="index-_003cflags_003e"></a>
<p>If a register’s value is composed from several separate values, define
it with either a structure type or a flags type.
A flags type may only contain bitfields.
A structure type may either contain only bitfields or contain no bitfields.
If the value contains only bitfields, its total size in bytes must be
specified.
</p>
<p>Non-bitfield values have a <var>name</var> and <var>type</var>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;struct id=&#34;<var>id</var>&#34;&gt;
  &lt;field name=&#34;<var>name</var>&#34; type=&#34;<var>type</var>&#34;/&gt;
  …
&lt;/struct&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Both <var>name</var> and <var>type</var> values are required.
No implicit padding is added.
</p>
<p>Bitfield values have a <var>name</var>, <var>start</var>, <var>end</var> and <var>type</var>.
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;struct id=&#34;<var>id</var>&#34; size=&#34;<var>size</var>&#34;&gt;
  &lt;field name=&#34;<var>name</var>&#34; start=&#34;<var>start</var>&#34; end=&#34;<var>end</var>&#34; type=&#34;<var>type</var>&#34;/&gt;
  …
&lt;/struct&gt;
</pre></div>

<div>
<pre>&lt;flags id=&#34;<var>id</var>&#34; size=&#34;<var>size</var>&#34;&gt;
  &lt;field name=&#34;<var>name</var>&#34; start=&#34;<var>start</var>&#34; end=&#34;<var>end</var>&#34; type=&#34;<var>type</var>&#34;/&gt;
  …
&lt;/flags&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The <var>name</var> value is required.
Bitfield values may be named with the empty string, ‘<samp>&#34;&#34;</samp>’,
in which case the field is “filler” and its value is not printed.
Not all bits need to be specified, so “filler” fields are optional.
</p>
<p>The <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> values are required, and <var>type</var>
is optional.
The field’s <var>start</var> must be less than or equal to its <var>end</var>,
and zero represents the least significant bit.
</p>
<p>The default value of <var>type</var> is <code>bool</code> for single bit fields,
and an unsigned integer otherwise.
</p>
<p>Which to choose?  Structures or flags?
</p>
<p>Registers defined with ‘<samp>flags</samp>’ have these advantages over
defining them with ‘<samp>struct</samp>’:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Arithmetic may be performed on them as if they were integers.
</li><li> They are printed in a more readable fashion.
</li></ul>

<p>Registers defined with ‘<samp>struct</samp>’ have one advantage over
defining them with ‘<samp>flags</samp>’:
</p>
<ul>
<li> One can fetch individual fields like in ‘<samp>C</samp>’.

<div>
<pre>(gdb) print $my_struct_reg.field3
$1 = 42
</pre></div>

</li></ul>

<a name="Registers-2"></a>
<h4>G.2.7 Registers</h4>
<a name="index-_003creg_003e"></a>

<p>Each register is represented as an element with this form:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;reg name=&#34;<var>name</var>&#34;
     bitsize=&#34;<var>size</var>&#34;
     <span>[</span>regnum=&#34;<var>num</var>&#34;<span>]</span>
     <span>[</span>save-restore=&#34;<var>save-restore</var>&#34;<span>]</span>
     <span>[</span>type=&#34;<var>type</var>&#34;<span>]</span>
     <span>[</span>group=&#34;<var>group</var>&#34;<span>]</span>/&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The components are as follows:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<dd><p>The register’s name; it must be unique within the target description.
</p>

</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>regnum</var></dt>
<dd><p>The register’s number.  If omitted, a register’s number is one greater
than that of the previous register (either in the current feature or in
a preceding feature); the first register in the target description
defaults to zero.  This register number is used to read or write
the register; e.g. it is used in the remote <code>p</code> and <code>P</code>
packets, and registers appear in the <code>g</code> and <code>G</code> packets
in order of increasing register number.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>save-restore</var></dt>
<dd><p>Whether the register should be preserved across inferior function
calls; this must be either <code>yes</code> or <code>no</code>.  The default is
<code>yes</code>, which is appropriate for most registers except for
some system control registers; this is not related to the target’s
ABI.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>type</var></dt>
<dd><p>The type of the register.  It may be a predefined type, a type
defined in the current feature, or one of the special types <code>int</code>
and <code>float</code>.  <code>int</code> is an integer type of the correct size
for <var>bitsize</var>, and <code>float</code> is a floating point type (in the
architecture’s normal floating point format) of the correct size for
<var>bitsize</var>.  The default is <code>int</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><var>group</var></dt>
<dd><p>The register group to which this register belongs.  It can be one of the
standard register groups <code>general</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>vector</code> or an
arbitrary string.  Group names should be limited to alphanumeric characters.
If a group name is made up of multiple words the words may be separated by
hyphens; e.g. <code>special-group</code> or <code>ultra-special-group</code>.  If no
<var>group</var> is specified, <small>GDB</small> will not display the register in
<code>info registers</code>.

<h3>G.4 Enum Target Types</h3>
<a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-enum-types"></a>

<p>Enum target types are useful in ‘<samp>struct</samp>’ and ‘<samp>flags</samp>’
register descriptions.  See <a href="#Target-Description-Format">Target Description Format</a>.
</p>
<p>Enum types have a name, size and a list of name/value pairs.
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;enum id=&#34;<var>id</var>&#34; size=&#34;<var>size</var>&#34;&gt;
  &lt;evalue name=&#34;<var>name</var>&#34; value=&#34;<var>value</var>&#34;/&gt;
  …
&lt;/enum&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Enums must be defined before they are used.
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;enum id=&#34;levels_type&#34; size=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
  &lt;evalue name=&#34;low&#34; value=&#34;0&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;evalue name=&#34;high&#34; value=&#34;1&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/enum&gt;
&lt;flags id=&#34;flags_type&#34; size=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
  &lt;field name=&#34;X&#34; start=&#34;0&#34;/&gt;
  &lt;field name=&#34;LEVEL&#34; start=&#34;1&#34; end=&#34;1&#34; type=&#34;levels_type&#34;/&gt;
&lt;/flags&gt;
&lt;reg name=&#34;flags&#34; bitsize=&#34;32&#34; type=&#34;flags_type&#34;/&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Given that description, a value of 3 for the ‘<samp>flags</samp>’ register
would be printed as:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) info register flags
flags 0x3 [ X LEVEL=high ]

<h3>G.5 Standard Target Features</h3>
<a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-standard-features"></a>

<p>A target description must contain either no registers or all the
target’s registers.  If the description contains no registers, then
<small>GDB</small> will assume a default register layout, selected based on
the architecture.  If the description contains any registers, the
default layout will not be used; the standard registers must be
described in the target description, in such a way that <small>GDB</small>
can recognize them.
</p>
<p>This is accomplished by giving specific names to feature elements
which contain standard registers.  <small>GDB</small> will look for features
with those names and verify that they contain the expected registers;
if any known feature is missing required registers, or if any required
feature is missing, <small>GDB</small> will reject the target
description.  You can add additional registers to any of the
standard features — <small>GDB</small> will display them just as if
they were added to an unrecognized feature.
</p>
<p>This section lists the known features and their expected contents.
Sample XML documents for these features are included in the
<small>GDB</small> source tree, in the directory <samp>gdb/features</samp>.
</p>
<p>Names recognized by <small>GDB</small> should include the name of the
company or organization which selected the name, and the overall
architecture to which the feature applies; so e.g. the feature
containing ARM core registers is named ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.core</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The names of registers are not case sensitive for the purpose
of recognizing standard features, but <small>GDB</small> will only display
registers using the capitalization used in the description.

<h4>G.5.1 AArch64 Features</h4>
<a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-AArch64-features"></a>

<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.core</samp>’ feature is required for AArch64
targets.  It should contain registers ‘<samp>x0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>x30</samp>’,
‘<samp>sp</samp>’, ‘<samp>pc</samp>’, and ‘<samp>cpsr</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.fpu</samp>’ feature is optional.  If present,
it should contain registers ‘<samp>v0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>v31</samp>’, ‘<samp>fpsr</samp>’,
and ‘<samp>fpcr</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.sve</samp>’ feature is optional.  If present,
it should contain registers ‘<samp>z0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>z31</samp>’, ‘<samp>p0</samp>’
through ‘<samp>p15</samp>’, ‘<samp>ffr</samp>’ and ‘<samp>vg</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.aarch64.pauth</samp>’ feature is optional.  If present,

<h4>G.5.2 ARC Features</h4>
<a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-ARC-Features"></a>

<p>ARC processors are so configurable that even core registers and their numbers
are not predetermined completely.  Moreover, <em>flags</em> and <em>PC</em>
registers, which are important to <small>GDB</small>, are not “core” registers in
ARC.  Therefore, there are two features that their presence is mandatory:
‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arc.core</samp>’ and ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arc.aux</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arc.core</samp>’ feature is required for all targets.  It must
contain registers:
</p>
<ul>
<li>- ‘<samp>r0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>r25</samp>’ for normal register file targets.
</li><li>- ‘<samp>r0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>r3</samp>’, and ‘<samp>r10</samp>’ through ‘<samp>r15</samp>’ for reduced
register file targets.
</li><li>- ‘<samp>gp</samp>’, ‘<samp>fp</samp>’, ‘<samp>sp</samp>’, ‘<samp>r30</samp>’<a name="DOCF23" href="#FOOT23"><sup>23</sup></a>,
‘<samp>blink</samp>’, ‘<samp>lp_count</samp>’, ‘<samp>pcl</samp>’.
</li></ul>

<p>In case of an ARCompact target (ARCv1 ISA), the ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arc.core</samp>’
feature may contain registers ‘<samp>ilink1</samp>’ and ‘<samp>ilink2</samp>’.  While in case
of ARC EM and ARC HS targets (ARCv2 ISA), register ‘<samp>ilink</samp>’ may be present.
The difference between ARCv1 and ARCv2 is the naming of registers <em>29th</em>
and <em>30th</em>.  They are called ‘<samp>ilink1</samp>’ and ‘<samp>ilink2</samp>’ for ARCv1 and
are optional.  For ARCv2, they are called ‘<samp>ilink</samp>’ and ‘<samp>r30</samp>’ and only
‘<samp>ilink</samp>’ is optional.  The optionality of ‘<samp>ilink*</samp>’ registers is
because of their inaccessibility during user space debugging sessions.
</p>
<p>Extension core registers ‘<samp>r32</samp>’ through ‘<samp>r59</samp>’ are optional and their
existence depends on the configuration.  When debugging GNU/Linux applications,
i.e. user space debugging, these core registers are not available.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arc.aux</samp>’ feature is required for all ARC targets.  Here
is the list of registers pertinent to this feature:
</p>
<ul>
<li>- mandatory: ‘<samp>pc</samp>’ and ‘<samp>status32</samp>’.
</li><li>- optional: ‘<samp>lp_start</samp>’, ‘<samp>lp_end</samp>’, and ‘<samp>bta</samp>’.
</li></ul>

ARM targets.
It should contain registers ‘<samp>r0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>r13</samp>’, ‘<samp>sp</samp>’,
‘<samp>lr</samp>’, ‘<samp>pc</samp>’, and ‘<samp>cpsr</samp>’.
</p>
<p>For M-profile targets (e.g. Cortex-M3), the ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.core</samp>’
feature is replaced by ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile</samp>’.  It should contain
registers ‘<samp>r0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>r13</samp>’, ‘<samp>sp</samp>’, ‘<samp>lr</samp>’, ‘<samp>pc</samp>’,
and ‘<samp>xpsr</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.fpa</samp>’ feature is optional.  If present, it
should contain registers ‘<samp>f0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>f7</samp>’ and ‘<samp>fps</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile-mve</samp>’ feature is optional.  If present, it
must contain register ‘<samp>vpr</samp>’.
</p>
<p>If the ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile-mve</samp>’ feature is available, <small>GDB</small>
will synthesize the ‘<samp>p0</samp>’ pseudo register from ‘<samp>vpr</samp>’ contents.
</p>
<p>If the ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.vfp</samp>’ feature is available alongside the
‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.m-profile-mve</samp>’ feature, <small>GDB</small> will
synthesize the ‘<samp>q</samp>’ pseudo registers from ‘<samp>d</samp>’ register
contents.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.xscale.iwmmxt</samp>’ feature is optional.  If present,
it should contain at least registers ‘<samp>wR0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>wR15</samp>’ and
‘<samp>wCGR0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>wCGR3</samp>’.  The ‘<samp>wCID</samp>’, ‘<samp>wCon</samp>’,
‘<samp>wCSSF</samp>’, and ‘<samp>wCASF</samp>’ registers are optional.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.vfp</samp>’ feature is optional.  If present, it
should contain at least registers ‘<samp>d0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>d15</samp>’.  If
they are present, ‘<samp>d16</samp>’ through ‘<samp>d31</samp>’ should also be included.
<small>GDB</small> will synthesize the single-precision registers from
halves of the double-precision registers.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.neon</samp>’ feature is optional.  It does not
need to contain registers; it instructs <small>GDB</small> to display the
VFP double-precision registers as vectors and to synthesize the
quad-precision registers from pairs of double-precision registers.
If this feature is present, ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.arm.vfp</samp>’ must also
be present and include 32 double-precision registers.

through ‘<samp>f31</samp>’) and the altivec registers (‘<samp>vr0</samp>’ through
‘<samp>vr31</samp>’) to present the 128-bit wide registers ‘<samp>vs0</samp>’ through
‘<samp>vs63</samp>’, the set of vector-scalar registers for POWER7.
Therefore, this feature requires both ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.fpu</samp>’ and
‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.altivec</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.spe</samp>’ feature is optional.  It should
contain registers ‘<samp>ev0h</samp>’ through ‘<samp>ev31h</samp>’, ‘<samp>acc</samp>’, and
‘<samp>spefscr</samp>’.  SPE targets should provide 32-bit registers in
‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.core</samp>’ and provide the upper halves in
‘<samp>ev0h</samp>’ through ‘<samp>ev31h</samp>’.  <small>GDB</small> will combine
these to present registers ‘<samp>ev0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>ev31</samp>’ to the
user.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.ppr</samp>’ feature is optional.  It should

64-bit wide.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.linux.pmu</samp>’ feature is optional.  It should
contain registers ‘<samp>mmcr0</samp>’, ‘<samp>mmcr2</samp>’, ‘<samp>siar</samp>’, ‘<samp>sdar</samp>’

server PMU registers provided by <small>GNU</small>/Linux.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.htm.spr</samp>’ feature is optional.  It should
contain registers ‘<samp>tfhar</samp>’, ‘<samp>texasr</samp>’ and ‘<samp>tfiar</samp>’, all
64-bit wide.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.htm.core</samp>’ feature is optional.  It should
contain the checkpointed general-purpose registers ‘<samp>cr0</samp>’ through
‘<samp>cr31</samp>’, as well as the checkpointed registers ‘<samp>clr</samp>’ and
‘<samp>cctr</samp>’.  These registers may all be either 32-bit or 64-bit
depending on the target.  It should also contain the checkpointed
registers ‘<samp>ccr</samp>’ and ‘<samp>cxer</samp>’, which should both be 32-bit
wide.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.htm.fpu</samp>’ feature is optional.  It should
contain the checkpointed 64-bit floating-point registers ‘<samp>cf0</samp>’

checkpointed registers ‘<samp>cvscr</samp>’ and ‘<samp>cvrsave</samp>’, both 32-bit
wide.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.htm.vsx</samp>’ feature is optional.  It should
contain registers ‘<samp>cvs0h</samp>’ through ‘<samp>cvs31h</samp>’.  <small>GDB</small>

registers (‘<samp>cf0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>cf31</samp>’) and the checkpointed
altivec registers (‘<samp>cvr0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>cvr31</samp>’) to present the
128-bit wide checkpointed vector-scalar registers ‘<samp>cvs0</samp>’ through
‘<samp>cvs63</samp>’.  Therefore, this feature requires both
‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.htm.altivec</samp>’ and
‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.htm.fpu</samp>’.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.power.htm.ppr</samp>’ feature is optional.  It should

<h4>G.5.13 RISC-V Features</h4>
<a name="index-target-descriptions_002c-RISC_002dV-Features"></a>

<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.riscv.cpu</samp>’ feature is required for RISC-V
targets.  It should contain the registers ‘<samp>x0</samp>’ through
‘<samp>x31</samp>’, and ‘<samp>pc</samp>’.  Either the architectural names (‘<samp>x0</samp>’,
‘<samp>x1</samp>’, etc) can be used, or the ABI names (‘<samp>zero</samp>’, ‘<samp>ra</samp>’,
etc).
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.riscv.fpu</samp>’ feature is optional.  If present, it
should contain registers ‘<samp>f0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>f31</samp>’, ‘<samp>fflags</samp>’,
‘<samp>frm</samp>’, and ‘<samp>fcsr</samp>’.  As with the cpu feature, either the
architectural register names, or the ABI names can be used.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.riscv.virtual</samp>’ feature is optional.  If present,
it should contain registers that are not backed by real registers on
the target, but are instead virtual, where the register value is
derived from other target state.  In many ways these are like
<small>GDB</small>s pseudo-registers, except implemented by the target.
Currently the only register expected in this set is the one byte
‘<samp>priv</samp>’ register that contains the target’s privilege level in the
least significant two bits.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.riscv.csr</samp>’ feature is optional.  If present, it
should contain all of the target’s standard CSRs.  Standard CSRs are
those defined in the RISC-V specification documents.  There is some
overlap between this feature and the fpu feature; the ‘<samp>fflags</samp>’,
‘<samp>frm</samp>’, and ‘<samp>fcsr</samp>’ registers could be in either feature.  The
expectation is that these registers will be in the fpu feature if the
target has floating point hardware, but can be moved into the csr
feature if the target has the floating point control registers, but no
other floating point hardware.
</p>
<p>The ‘<samp>org.gnu.gdb.riscv.vector</samp>’ feature is optional.  If present,
it should contain registers ‘<samp>v0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>v31</samp>’, all of which
must be the same size.  These requirements are based on the v0.10
draft vector extension, as the vector extension is not yet final.  In
the event that the register set of the vector extension changes for
the final specification, the requirements given here could change for
future releases of <small>GDB</small>.

64-bit wide registers ‘<samp>v0l</samp>’ through ‘<samp>v15l</samp>’, which will be
combined by <small>GDB</small> with the floating point registers ‘<samp>f0</samp>’
through ‘<samp>f15</samp>’ to present the 128-bit wide vector registers
‘<samp>v0</samp>’ through ‘<samp>v15</samp>’.  In addition, this feature should
contain the 128-bit wide vector registers ‘<samp>v16</samp>’ through

<h2>Appendix H Operating System Information</h2>
<a name="index-operating-system-information"></a>

<p>Users of <small>GDB</small> often wish to obtain information about the state of
the operating system running on the target—for example the list of
processes, or the list of open files.  This section describes the
mechanism that makes it possible.  This mechanism is similar to the 
target features mechanism (see <a href="#Target-Descriptions">Target Descriptions</a>), but focuses
on a different aspect of target.
</p>
<p>Operating system information is retrieved from the target via the
remote protocol, using ‘<samp>qXfer</samp>’ requests (see <a href="#qXfer-osdata-read">qXfer osdata read</a>).  The object name in the request should be ‘<samp>osdata</samp>’, and
the <var>annex</var> identifies the data to be fetched.
</p>


<hr/>
<a name="Process-list"></a>

<a name="Process-list-1"></a>
<h3>H.1 Process list</h3>
<a name="index-operating-system-information_002c-process-list"></a>

<p>When requesting the process list, the <var>annex</var> field in the
‘<samp>qXfer</samp>’ request should be ‘<samp>processes</samp>’.  The returned data is
an XML document.  The formal syntax of this document is defined in
<samp>gdb/features/osdata.dtd</samp>.
</p>
<p>An example document is:
</p>
<div>
<pre>&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE target SYSTEM &#34;osdata.dtd&#34;&gt;
&lt;osdata type=&#34;processes&#34;&gt;
  &lt;item&gt;
    &lt;column name=&#34;pid&#34;&gt;1&lt;/column&gt;
    &lt;column name=&#34;user&#34;&gt;root&lt;/column&gt;
    &lt;column name=&#34;command&#34;&gt;/sbin/init&lt;/column&gt;
    &lt;column name=&#34;cores&#34;&gt;1,2,3&lt;/column&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/osdata&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Each item should include a column whose name is ‘<samp>pid</samp>’.  The value
of that column should identify the process on the target.  The
‘<samp>user</samp>’ and ‘<samp>command</samp>’ columns are optional, and will be
displayed by <small>GDB</small>.  The ‘<samp>cores</samp>’ column, if present,
should contain a comma-separated list of cores that this process
is running on.  Target may provide additional columns,
which <small>GDB</small> currently ignores.
</p>
<hr/>
<a name="Trace-File-Format"></a>

<a name="Trace-File-Format-1"></a>
<h2>Appendix I Trace File Format</h2>
<a name="index-trace-file-format"></a>

<p>The trace file comes in three parts: a header, a textual description
section, and a trace frame section with binary data.
</p>
<p>The header has the form <code>\x7fTRACE0\n</code>.  The first byte is
<code>0x7f</code> so as to indicate that the file contains binary data,
while the <code>0</code> is a version number that may have different values
in the future.
</p>
<p>The description section consists of multiple lines of <small>ASCII</small> text
separated by newline characters (<code>0xa</code>).  The lines may include a
variety of optional descriptive or context-setting information, such
as tracepoint definitions or register set size.  <small>GDB</small> will
ignore any line that it does not recognize.  An empty line marks the end
of this section.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>R <var>size</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the size of a register block in bytes.  This is equal to the
size of a <code>g</code> packet payload in the remote protocol.  <var>size</var>
is an ascii decimal number.  There should be only one such line in
a single trace file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>status <var>status</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Trace status.  <var>status</var> has the same format as a <code>qTStatus</code>
remote packet reply.  There should be only one such line in a single trace
file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tp <var>payload</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Tracepoint definition.  The <var>payload</var> has the same format as
<code>qTfP</code>/<code>qTsP</code> remote packet reply payload.  A single tracepoint
may take multiple lines of definition, corresponding to the multiple
reply packets.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tsv <var>payload</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Trace state variable definition.  The <var>payload</var> has the same format as
<code>qTfV</code>/<code>qTsV</code> remote packet reply payload.  A single variable
may take multiple lines of definition, corresponding to the multiple
reply packets.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tdesc <var>payload</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Target description in XML format.  The <var>payload</var> is a single line of
the XML file.  All such lines should be concatenated together to get
the original XML file.  This file is in the same format as <code>qXfer</code>
<code>features</code> payload, and corresponds to the main <code>target.xml</code>
file.  Includes are not allowed.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The trace frame section consists of a number of consecutive frames.
Each frame begins with a two-byte tracepoint number, followed by a
four-byte size giving the amount of data in the frame.  The data in
the frame consists of a number of blocks, each introduced by a
character indicating its type (at least register, memory, and trace
state variable).  The data in this section is raw binary, not a
hexadecimal or other encoding; its endianness matches the target’s
endianness.
</p>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>R <var>bytes</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Register block.  The number and ordering of bytes matches that of a
<code>g</code> packet in the remote protocol.  Note that these are the
actual bytes, in target order, not a hexadecimal encoding.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>M <var>address</var> <var>length</var> <var>bytes</var>...</code></dt>
<dd><p>Memory block.  This is a contiguous block of memory, at the 8-byte
address <var>address</var>, with a 2-byte length <var>length</var>, followed by
<var>length</var> bytes.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>V <var>number</var> <var>value</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Trace state variable block.  This records the 8-byte signed value
<var>value</var> of trace state variable numbered <var>number</var>.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Future enhancements of the trace file format may include additional types
of blocks.

<h2>Appendix J <code>.gdb_index</code> section format</h2>
<a name="index-_002egdb_005findex-section-format"></a>
<a name="index-index-section-format"></a>

<p>This section documents the index section that is created by <code>save
gdb-index</code> (see <a href="#Index-Files">Index Files</a>).  The index section is
DWARF-specific; some knowledge of DWARF is assumed in this
description.
</p>
<p>The mapped index file format is designed to be directly
<code>mmap</code>able on any architecture.  In most cases, a datum is
represented using a little-endian 32-bit integer value, called an
<code>offset_type</code>.  Big endian machines must byte-swap the values
before using them.  Exceptions to this rule are noted.  The data is
laid out such that alignment is always respected.
</p>
<p>A mapped index consists of several areas, laid out in order.
</p>
<ol>
<li> The file header.  This is a sequence of values, of <code>offset_type</code>
unless otherwise noted:

<ol>
<li> The version number, currently 8.  Versions 1, 2 and 3 are obsolete.
Version 4 uses a different hashing function from versions 5 and 6.
Version 6 includes symbols for inlined functions, whereas versions 4
and 5 do not.  Version 7 adds attributes to the CU indices in the
symbol table.  Version 8 specifies that symbols from DWARF type units
(‘<samp>DW_TAG_type_unit</samp>’) refer to the type unit’s symbol table and not the
compilation unit (‘<samp>DW_TAG_comp_unit</samp>’) using the type.

<p><small>GDB</small> will only read version 4, 5, or 6 indices
by specifying <code>set use-deprecated-index-sections on</code>.
GDB has a workaround for potentially broken version 7 indices so it is
currently not flagged as deprecated.
</p>
</li><li> The offset, from the start of the file, of the CU list.

</li><li> The offset, from the start of the file, of the types CU list.  Note
that this area can be empty, in which case this offset will be equal
to the next offset.

</li><li> The offset, from the start of the file, of the address area.

</li><li> The offset, from the start of the file, of the symbol table.

</li><li> The offset, from the start of the file, of the constant pool.
</li></ol>

</li><li> The CU list.  This is a sequence of pairs of 64-bit little-endian
values, sorted by the CU offset.  The first element in each pair is
the offset of a CU in the <code>.debug_info</code> section.  The second
element in each pair is the length of that CU.  References to a CU
elsewhere in the map are done using a CU index, which is just the
0-based index into this table.  Note that if there are type CUs, then
conceptually CUs and type CUs form a single list for the purposes of
CU indices.

</li><li> The types CU list.  This is a sequence of triplets of 64-bit
little-endian values.  In a triplet, the first value is the CU offset,
the second value is the type offset in the CU, and the third value is
the type signature.  The types CU list is not sorted.

</li><li> The address area.  The address area consists of a sequence of address
entries.  Each address entry has three elements:

<ol>
<li> The low address.  This is a 64-bit little-endian value.

</li><li> The high address.  This is a 64-bit little-endian value.  Like
<code>DW_AT_high_pc</code>, the value is one byte beyond the end.

</li><li> The CU index.  This is an <code>offset_type</code> value.
</li></ol>

</li><li> The symbol table.  This is an open-addressed hash table.  The size of
the hash table is always a power of 2.

<p>Each slot in the hash table consists of a pair of <code>offset_type</code>
values.  The first value is the offset of the symbol’s name in the
constant pool.  The second value is the offset of the CU vector in the
constant pool.
</p>
<p>If both values are 0, then this slot in the hash table is empty.  This
is ok because while 0 is a valid constant pool index, it cannot be a
valid index for both a string and a CU vector.
</p>
<p>The hash value for a table entry is computed by applying an
iterative hash function to the symbol’s name.  Starting with an
initial value of <code>r = 0</code>, each (unsigned) character ‘<samp>c</samp>’ in
the string is incorporated into the hash using the formula depending on the
index version:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>Version 4</dt>
<dd><p>The formula is <code>r = r * 67 + c - 113</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Versions 5 to 7</dt>
<dd><p>The formula is <code>r = r * 67 + tolower (c) - 113</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The terminating ‘<samp>\0</samp>’ is not incorporated into the hash.
</p>
<p>The step size used in the hash table is computed via
<code>((hash * 17) &amp; (size - 1)) | 1</code>, where ‘<samp>hash</samp>’ is the hash
value, and ‘<samp>size</samp>’ is the size of the hash table.  The step size
is used to find the next candidate slot when handling a hash
collision.
</p>
<p>The names of C<tt>++</tt> symbols in the hash table are canonicalized.  We
don’t currently have a simple description of the canonicalization
algorithm; if you intend to create new index sections, you must read
the code.
</p>
</li><li> The constant pool.  This is simply a bunch of bytes.  It is organized
so that alignment is correct: CU vectors are stored first, followed by
strings.

<p>A CU vector in the constant pool is a sequence of <code>offset_type</code>
values.  The first value is the number of CU indices in the vector.
Each subsequent value is the index and symbol attributes of a CU in
the CU list.  This element in the hash table is used to indicate which
CUs define the symbol and how the symbol is used.
See below for the format of each CU index+attributes entry.
</p>
<p>A string in the constant pool is zero-terminated.
</p></li></ol>

<p>Attributes were added to CU index values in <code>.gdb_index</code> version 7.
If a symbol has multiple uses within a CU then there is one
CU index+attributes value for each use.
</p>
<p>The format of each CU index+attributes entry is as follows
(bit 0 = LSB):
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>Bits 0-23</dt>
<dd><p>This is the index of the CU in the CU list.
</p></dd>
<dt>Bits 24-27</dt>
<dd><p>These bits are reserved for future purposes and must be zero.
</p></dd>
<dt>Bits 28-30</dt>
<dd><p>The kind of the symbol in the CU.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>0</dt>
<dd><p>This value is reserved and should not be used.
By reserving zero the full <code>offset_type</code> value is backwards compatible
with previous versions of the index.
</p></dd>
<dt>1</dt>
<dd><p>The symbol is a type.
</p></dd>
<dt>2</dt>
<dd><p>The symbol is a variable or an enum value.
</p></dd>
<dt>3</dt>
<dd><p>The symbol is a function.
</p></dd>
<dt>4</dt>
<dd><p>Any other kind of symbol.
</p></dd>
<dt>5,6,7</dt>
<dd><p>These values are reserved.
</p></dd>
</dl>

</dd>
<dt>Bit 31</dt>
<dd><p>This bit is zero if the value is global and one if it is static.
</p>
<p>The determination of whether a symbol is global or static is complicated.
The authorative reference is the file <samp>dwarf2read.c</samp> in
<small>GDB</small> sources.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>This pseudo-code describes the computation of a symbol’s kind and

<p>gdb [OPTIONS] [<var>prog</var>|<var>prog</var> <var>procID</var>|<var>prog</var> <var>core</var>]
</p>
<p>The purpose of a debugger such as <small>GDB</small> is to allow you to see what is
going on “inside” another program while it executes – or what another
program was doing at the moment it crashed.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> can do four main kinds of things (plus other things in support of
these) to help you catch bugs in the act:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Start your program, specifying anything that might affect its behavior.

</li><li> Make your program stop on specified conditions.

</li><li> Examine what has happened, when your program has stopped.

</li><li> Change things in your program, so you can experiment with correcting the
effects of one bug and go on to learn about another.
</li></ul>

<p>You can use <small>GDB</small> to debug programs written in C, C<tt>++</tt>, Fortran and
Modula-2.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> is invoked with the shell command <code>gdb</code>.  Once started, it reads
commands from the terminal until you tell it to exit with the <small>GDB</small>
command <code>quit</code> or <code>exit</code>.  You can get online help from <small>GDB</small> itself
by using the command <code>help</code>.
</p>
<p>You can run <code>gdb</code> with no arguments or options; but the most
usual way to start <small>GDB</small> is with one argument or two, specifying an
executable program as the argument:
</p>


<p>You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:
</p>


<p>You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument or use option
<code>-p</code>, if you want to debug a running process:
</p>
<div>
<pre>gdb program 1234
gdb -p 1234
</pre></div>

<p>would attach <small>GDB</small> to process <code>1234</code>.  With option <samp>-p</samp> you
can omit the <var>program</var> filename.
</p>
<p>Here are some of the most frequently needed <small>GDB</small> commands:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>break [<var>file</var>:][<var>function</var>|<var>line</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Set a breakpoint at <var>function</var> or <var>line</var> (in <var>file</var>).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>run [<var>arglist</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Start your program (with <var>arglist</var>, if specified).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>bt</code></dt>
<dd><p>Backtrace: display the program stack.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>print <var>expr</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Display the value of an expression.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>c</code></dt>
<dd><p>Continue running your program (after stopping, e.g. at a breakpoint).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>next</code></dt>
<dd><p>Execute next program line (after stopping); step <em>over</em> any
function calls in the line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>edit [<var>file</var>:]<var>function</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>look at the program line where it is presently stopped.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>list [<var>file</var>:]<var>function</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>type the text of the program in the vicinity of where it is presently stopped.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>step</code></dt>
<dd><p>Execute next program line (after stopping); step <em>into</em> any
function calls in the line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>help [<var>name</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><p>Show information about <small>GDB</small> command <var>name</var>, or general information
about using <small>GDB</small>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>quit</code></dt>
<dt><code>exit</code></dt>
<dd><p>Exit from <small>GDB</small>.
</p></dd>
</dl>


<p>Any arguments other than options specify an executable
file and core file (or process ID); that is, the first argument
encountered with no
associated option flag is equivalent to a <samp>--se</samp> option, and the second,
if any, is equivalent to a <samp>-c</samp> option if it’s the name of a file.
Many options have
both long and abbreviated forms; both are shown here.  The long forms are also
recognized if you truncate them, so long as enough of the option is
present to be unambiguous.
</p>
<p>The abbreviated forms are shown here with ‘<samp>-</samp>’ and long forms are shown
with ‘<samp>--</samp>’ to reflect how they are shown in <samp>--help</samp>. However,
<small>GDB</small> recognizes all of the following conventions for most options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>--option=<var>value</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>--option <var>value</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-option=<var>value</var></code></dt>

<dt><code>--o <var>value</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-o=<var>value</var></code></dt>
<dt><code>-o <var>value</var></code></dt>

<p>All the options and command line arguments you give are processed
in sequential order.  The order makes a difference when the <samp>-x</samp>
option is used.

<h3>gdbserver man</h3>

<div>
<pre>gdbserver <var>comm</var> <var>prog</var> [<var>args</var>…]

gdbserver –attach <var>comm</var> <var>pid</var>

gdbserver –multi <var>comm</var>
</pre></div>

<p><code>gdbserver</code> is a program that allows you to run <small>GDB</small> on a different machine
than the one which is running the program being debugged.
</p>
<a name="Usage-_0028server-_0028target_0029-side_0029"></a>
<h4>Usage (server (target) side)</h4>

<p>First, you need to have a copy of the program you want to debug put onto
the target system.  The program can be stripped to save space if needed, as
<code>gdbserver</code> doesn’t care about symbols.  All symbol handling is taken care of by
the <small>GDB</small> running on the host system.
</p>
<p>To use the server, you log on to the target system, and run the <code>gdbserver</code>
program.  You must tell it (a) how to communicate with <small>GDB</small>, (b) the name of
your program, and (c) its arguments.  The general syntax is:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver <var>comm</var> <var>program</var> [<var>args</var> ...]
</pre></div>

<p>For example, using a serial port, you might say:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver <samp>/dev/com1</samp> emacs foo.txt
</pre></div>

<p>This tells <code>gdbserver</code> to debug emacs with an argument of foo.txt, and
to communicate with <small>GDB</small> via <samp>/dev/com1</samp>.  <code>gdbserver</code> now
waits patiently for the host <small>GDB</small> to communicate with it.
</p>
<p>To use a TCP connection, you could say:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver host:2345 emacs foo.txt
</pre></div>

<p>This says pretty much the same thing as the last example, except that we are
going to communicate with the <code>host</code> <small>GDB</small> via TCP.  The <code>host:2345</code> argument means
that we are expecting to see a TCP connection from <code>host</code> to local TCP port
2345.  (Currently, the <code>host</code> part is ignored.)  You can choose any number you
want for the port number as long as it does not conflict with any existing TCP
ports on the target system.  This same port number must be used in the host
<small>GDB</small>s <code>target remote</code> command, which will be described shortly.  Note that if
you chose a port number that conflicts with another service, <code>gdbserver</code> will
print an error message and exit.
</p>
<p><code>gdbserver</code> can also attach to running programs.
This is accomplished via the <samp>--attach</samp> argument.  The syntax is:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> <var>pid</var>
</pre></div>

<p><var>pid</var> is the process ID of a currently running process.  It isn’t
necessary to point <code>gdbserver</code> at a binary for the running process.
</p>
<p>To start <code>gdbserver</code> without supplying an initial command to run
or process ID to attach, use the <samp>--multi</samp> command line option.
In such case you should connect using <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd> to start
the program you want to debug.
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver --multi <var>comm</var>
</pre></div>

<a name="Usage-_0028host-side_0029"></a>
<h4>Usage (host side)</h4>

<p>You need an unstripped copy of the target program on your host system, since
<small>GDB</small> needs to examine its symbol tables and such.  Start up <small>GDB</small> as you normally
would, with the target program as the first argument.  (You may need to use the
<samp>--baud</samp> option if the serial line is running at anything except 9600 baud.)
That is <code>gdb TARGET-PROG</code>, or <code>gdb --baud BAUD TARGET-PROG</code>.  After that, the only
new command you need to know about is <code>target remote</code>
(or <code>target extended-remote</code>).  Its argument is either
a device name (usually a serial device, like <samp>/dev/ttyb</samp>), or a <code>HOST:PORT</code>
descriptor.  For example:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) target remote <samp>/dev/ttyb</samp>
</pre></div>

<p>communicates with the server via serial line <samp>/dev/ttyb</samp>, and:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) target remote the-target:2345
</pre></div>

<p>communicates via a TCP connection to port 2345 on host ‘the-target’, where
you previously started up <code>gdbserver</code> with the same port number.  Note that for
TCP connections, you must start up <code>gdbserver</code> prior to using the ‘target remote’
command, otherwise you may get an error that looks something like
‘Connection refused’.
</p>
<p><code>gdbserver</code> can also debug multiple inferiors at once,
described in
<a href="#Inferiors-Connections-and-Programs">Inferiors Connections and Programs</a>.
In such case use the <code>extended-remote</code> <small>GDB</small> command variant:
</p>
<div>
<pre>(gdb) target extended-remote the-target:2345
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>gdbserver</code> option <samp>--multi</samp> may or may not be used in such
case.
</p>
<p>There are three different modes for invoking <code>gdbserver</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Debug a specific program specified by its program name:

<div>
<pre>gdbserver <var>comm</var> <var>prog</var> [<var>args</var>…]
</pre></div>

<p>The <var>comm</var> parameter specifies how should the server communicate
with <small>GDB</small>; it is either a device name (to use a serial line),
a TCP port number (<code>:1234</code>), or <code>-</code> or <code>stdio</code> to use
stdin/stdout of <code>gdbserver</code>.  Specify the name of the program to
debug in <var>prog</var>.  Any remaining arguments will be passed to the
program verbatim.  When the program exits, <small>GDB</small> will close the
connection, and <code>gdbserver</code> will exit.
</p>
</li><li> Debug a specific program by specifying the process ID of a running
program:

<div>
<pre>gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> <var>pid</var>
</pre></div>

<p>The <var>comm</var> parameter is as described above.  Supply the process ID
of a running program in <var>pid</var>; <small>GDB</small> will do everything
else.  Like with the previous mode, when the process <var>pid</var> exits,
<small>GDB</small> will close the connection, and <code>gdbserver</code> will exit.
</p>
</li><li> Multi-process mode – debug more than one program/process:



<p>In this mode, <small>GDB</small> can instruct <code>gdbserver</code> which
command(s) to run.  Unlike the other 2 modes, <small>GDB</small> will not
close the connection when a process being debugged exits, so you can
debug several processes in the same session.
</p></li></ul>

<p>In each of the modes you may specify these options:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>--help</code></dt>
<dd><p>List all options, with brief explanations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>--version</code></dt>
<dd><p>This option causes <code>gdbserver</code> to print its version number and exit.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>--attach</code></dt>
<dd><p><code>gdbserver</code> will attach to a running program.  The syntax is:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver --attach <var>comm</var> <var>pid</var>
</pre></div>

<p><var>pid</var> is the process ID of a currently running process.  It isn’t
necessary to point <code>gdbserver</code> at a binary for the running process.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>--multi</code></dt>
<dd><p>To start <code>gdbserver</code> without supplying an initial command to run
or process ID to attach, use this command line option.
Then you can connect using <kbd>target extended-remote</kbd> and start
the program you want to debug.  The syntax is:
</p>
<div>
<pre>target&gt; gdbserver --multi <var>comm</var>
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>--debug</code></dt>
<dd><p>Instruct <code>gdbserver</code> to display extra status information about the debugging
process.
This option is intended for <code>gdbserver</code> development and for bug reports to
the developers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>--remote-debug</code></dt>
<dd><p>Instruct <code>gdbserver</code> to display remote protocol debug output.
This option is intended for <code>gdbserver</code> development and for bug reports to
the developers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>--debug-file=<var>filename</var></code></dt>
<dd><p>Instruct <code>gdbserver</code> to send any debug output to the given <var>filename</var>.
This option is intended for <code>gdbserver</code> development and for bug reports to
the developers.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>--debug-format=option1<span>[</span>,option2,...<span>]</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Instruct <code>gdbserver</code> to include extra information in each line
of debugging output.
See <a href="#Other-Command_002dLine-Arguments-for-gdbserver">Other Command-Line Arguments for gdbserver</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>--wrapper</code></dt>
<dd><p>Specify a wrapper to launch programs
for debugging.  The option should be followed by the name of the
wrapper, then any command-line arguments to pass to the wrapper, then
<kbd>--</kbd> indicating the end of the wrapper arguments.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>--once</code></dt>
<dd><p>By default, <code>gdbserver</code> keeps the listening TCP port open, so that
additional connections are possible.  However, if you start <code>gdbserver</code>
with the <samp>--once</samp> option, it will stop listening for any further
connection attempts after connecting to the first <small>GDB</small> session.

<h2>Appendix M GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</h2>
<p>Version 3, 29 June 2007
</p>

<div>
<pre>Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre></div>

<a name="Preamble"></a>
<h3>Preamble</h3>

<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.
</p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom
to share and change all versions of a program—to make sure it remains
free software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation,
use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.  You
can apply it to your programs, too.
</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom
of others.
</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.
</p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
</p>
<p>For the developers’ and authors’ protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users’ and
authors’ sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.
</p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the
manufacturer can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the
aim of protecting users’ freedom to change the software.  The
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for
individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the
practice for those products.  If such problems arise substantially in
other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those
domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
freedom of users.
</p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program
could make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL
assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
</p>
<a name="TERMS-AND-CONDITIONS"></a>
<h3>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>

<ol start="0">
<li> Definitions.

<p>“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
</p>
<p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds
of works, such as semiconductor masks.
</p>
<p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.  “Licensees” and
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.
</p>
<p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
an exact copy.  The resulting work is called a “modified version” of
the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.
</p>
<p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.
</p>
<p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.
</p>
<p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user
through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
conveying.
</p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
</p>
</li><li> Source Code.

<p>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  “Object code” means any non-source form
of a work.
</p>
<p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.
</p>
<p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
“Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
</p>
<p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work’s
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.
</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
work.
</p>
</li><li> Basic Permissions.

<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
</p>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the
terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not
control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works for
you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your
copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
</p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.
</p>
</li><li> Protecting Users’ Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.
</p>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such
circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with
respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against
the work’s users, your or third parties’ legal rights to forbid
circumvention of technological measures.
</p>
</li><li> Conveying Verbatim Copies.

<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program’s source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
</p>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
</p>
</li><li> Conveying Modified Source Versions.

<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:
</p>
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li> The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

</li><li> The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7.  This
requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all
notices”.

</li><li> You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This License will
therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms,
to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
are packaged.  This License gives no permission to license the work in
any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have
separately received it.

</li><li> If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.
</li></ol>

<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
“aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation’s users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.
</p>
</li><li> Conveying Non-Source Forms.

<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these
ways:
</p>
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li> Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily
used for software interchange.

</li><li> Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written
offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you
offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used
for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable
cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2) access
to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

</li><li> Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This alternative is
allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you
received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection
6b.

</li><li> Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place
(gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to copy
the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be
on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports
equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions
next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source.
Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain
obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to
satisfy these requirements.

</li><li> Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of
the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under
subsection 6d.

</li></ol>

<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.
</p>
<p>A “User Product” is either (1) a “consumer product”, which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
coverage.  For a particular product received by a particular user,
“normally used” refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
to use, the product.  A product is a consumer product regardless of
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant
mode of use of the product.
</p>
<p>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
solely because modification has been made.
</p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).
</p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
installed.  Access to a network may be denied when the modification
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
network.
</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.
</p>
</li><li> Additional Terms.

<p>“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.
</p>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
</p>
<ol type="a" start="1">
<li> Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms
of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

</li><li> Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices
displayed by works containing it; or

</li><li> Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

</li><li> Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
authors of the material; or

</li><li> Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade
names, trademarks, or service marks; or

</li><li> Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with
contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any
liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those
licensors and authors.
</li></ol>

<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further
restrictions” within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.
</p>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.
</p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
above requirements apply either way.
</p>
</li><li> Termination.

<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).
</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.
</p>
</li><li> Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
</p>
</li><li> Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
</p>
<p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party’s predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
</p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
</p>
</li><li> Patents.

<p>A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor’s “contributor version”.
</p>
<p>A contributor’s “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.
</p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor’s essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.
</p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To “grant” such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.
</p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  “Knowingly relying” means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient’s use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.
</p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.
</p>
<p>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered work if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties
who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by
you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
</p>
</li><li> No Surrender of Others’ Freedom.

<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey
a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree
to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could
satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the Program.
</p>
</li><li> Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.
</p>
</li><li> Revised Versions of this License.

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or
of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If
the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU General
Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.
</p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy’s public
statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to
choose that version for the Program.
</p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.
</p>
</li><li> Disclaimer of Warranty.

<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.
</p>
</li><li> Limitation of Liability.

<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</p>
</li><li> Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

<h3>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h3>

<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.
</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the “copyright” line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
</p>
<div>
<pre><var>one line to give the program&#39;s name and a brief idea of what it does.</var>
Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at
your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program.  If not, see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</pre></div>

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
</p>
<p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
</p>
<div>
<pre><var>program</var> Copyright (C) <var>year</var> <var>name of author</var>
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type ‘<samp>show w</samp>’.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type ‘<samp>show c</samp>’ for details.
</pre></div>

<p>The hypothetical commands ‘<samp>show w</samp>’ and ‘<samp>show c</samp>’ should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program’s commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an “about box”.
</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/</a>.
</p>
<p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.  But

<h2>Appendix N GNU Free Documentation License</h2>
<p>Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
</p>

<div>
<pre>Copyright © 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<a href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre></div>

<ol start="0">
<li> PREAMBLE

<p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
functional and useful document <em>free</em> in the sense of freedom: to
assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible
for modifications made by others.
</p>
<p>This License is a kind of “copyleft”, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
</p>
<p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
</p>
</li><li> APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

<p>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice grants a
world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that
work under the conditions stated herein.  The “Document”, below,
refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a
licensee, and is addressed as “you”.  You accept the license if you
copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission
under copyright law.
</p>
<p>A “Modified Version” of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
</p>
<p>A “Secondary Section” is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document’s overall
subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document is in
part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
</p>
<p>The “Invariant Sections” are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.  If a
section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not
allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may contain zero
Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify any Invariant
Sections then there are none.
</p>
<p>The “Cover Texts” are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.  A Front-Cover Text may
be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.
</p>
<p>A “Transparent” copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revising the document
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart
or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.
An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount
of text.  A copy that is not “Transparent” is called “Opaque”.
</p>
<p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<small>ASCII</small> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> designed for human modification.  Examples
of transparent image formats include <acronym>PNG</acronym>, <acronym>XCF</acronym> and
<acronym>JPG</acronym>.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be
read and edited only by proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or
<acronym>XML</acronym> for which the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are
not generally available, and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
PostScript or <acronym>PDF</acronym> produced by some word processors for
output purposes only.
</p>
<p>The “Title Page” means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, “Title Page” means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work’s title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
</p>
<p>The “publisher” means any person or entity that distributes copies
of the Document to the public.
</p>
<p>A section “Entitled XYZ” means a named subunit of the Document whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, “Endorsements”, or “History”.)  To “Preserve the Title”
of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
section “Entitled XYZ” according to this definition.
</p>
<p>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Document.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.
</p>
</li><li> VERBATIM COPYING

<p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
</p>
<p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
</p>
</li><li> COPYING IN QUANTITY

<p>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
Document’s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
</p>
<p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
</p>
<p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a computer-network location from which the general network-using
public has access to download using public-standard network protocols
a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.
If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an
Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
edition to the public.
</p>
<p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
</p>
</li><li> MODIFICATIONS

<p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
</p>
<ol type="A" start="1">
<li> Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

</li><li> List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five),
unless they release you from this requirement.

</li><li> State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

</li><li> Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

</li><li> Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

</li><li> Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

</li><li> Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document’s license notice.

</li><li> Include an unaltered copy of this License.

</li><li> Preserve the section Entitled “History”, Preserve its Title, and add
to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section Entitled “History” in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

</li><li> Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the “History” section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

</li><li> For any section Entitled “Acknowledgements” or “Dedications”, Preserve
the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
dedications given therein.

</li><li> Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

</li><li> Delete any section Entitled “Endorsements”.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

</li><li> Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled “Endorsements” or
to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

</li><li> Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
</li></ol>

<p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version’s license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
</p>
<p>You may add a section Entitled “Endorsements”, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
</p>
<p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
</p>
<p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
</p>
</li><li> COMBINING DOCUMENTS

<p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.
</p>
<p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
</p>
<p>In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled “History”
in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled
“History”; likewise combine any sections Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
and any sections Entitled “Dedications”.  You must delete all
sections Entitled “Endorsements.”
</p>
</li><li> COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

<p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
</p>
<p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
</p>
</li><li> AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

<p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, is called an “aggregate” if the copyright
resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation’s users beyond what the individual works permit.
When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Document.
</p>
<p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of
the entire aggregate, the Document’s Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.
Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole
aggregate.
</p>
</li><li> TRANSLATION

<p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include
the original English version of this License and the original versions
of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between
the translation and the original version of this License or a notice
or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.
</p>
<p>If a section in the Document is Entitled “Acknowledgements”,
“Dedications”, or “History”, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.
</p>
</li><li> TERMINATION

<p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and
will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.
</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.
</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does
not give you any rights to use it.
</p>
</li><li> FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.
</p>
<p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Document
specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this
License can be used, that proxy’s public statement of acceptance of a
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
Document.
</p>
</li><li> RELICENSING

<p>“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site” (or “MMC Site”) means any
World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.  A
“Massive Multiauthor Collaboration” (or “MMC”) contained in the
site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
site.
</p>
<p>“CC-BY-SA” means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
published by that same organization.
</p>
<p>“Incorporate” means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
in part, as part of another Document.
</p>
<p>An MMC is “eligible for relicensing” if it is licensed under this
License, and if all works that were first published under this License
somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole
or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections,
and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008.
</p>
<p>The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site
under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009,
provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.
</p>

<a name="ADDENDUM_003a-How-to-use-this-License-for-your-documents"></a>
<h3>ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h3>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
</p>
<div>
<pre>  Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
  Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
  under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
  or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
  with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
  Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
  Free Documentation License&#39;&#39;.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts,
replace the “with…Texts.” line with this:
</p>
<div>
<pre>    with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with
    the Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts
    being <var>list</var>.
</pre></div>

<p>If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.
</p>
<p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
