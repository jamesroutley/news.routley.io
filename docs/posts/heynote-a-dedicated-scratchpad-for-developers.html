          <h3>One buffer, many blocks</h3>
          <p>
            At its core, Heynote is a large, persistent text buffer divided into blocks. 
            Creating a new block is as easy as pressing <span><span>⌘</span>-Enter</span>, 
            and pressing <span><span>⌘</span>-A</span> within 
            a block selects the content of just that block.
          </p>
          <p>
            Works great for that Slack message you don&#39;t want to accidentally send, a JSON response 
            from an API you&#39;re working with, notes from a meeting, your daily to-do list, etc.
