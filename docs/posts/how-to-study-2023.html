<h2>1.  Introduction</h2>

&#34;using learning-styles theories in the classroom does not bring an
advantage to students. … There&#39;s increasing evidence that people
[who claim to have learning preferences] act on those beliefs ….
But doing so confers no cognitive advantage.  People believe they have
learning styles, and they try to think in their preferred style, but doing
so doesn&#39;t help them think.&#34; (pp. 28–29)

<b>&#34;Studying&#34; is not the same thing as &#34;doing homework&#34;!</b>

<p>
Studying may <i>include</i> doing homework, but it is also a lot more,
as you will see. </p><p>
I am going to give you some suggestions on how to study efficiently. They

without some individual modifications.</p><p>

2.  Manage Your Time</a></h2><a name="time">

</a><ul><a name="time"></a><a href="http://www.funkywinkerbean.com/" target="_blank">
<img src="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/Funky_Winkerbean-timemgt.gif"/></a>
</ul>
<p>
2.1. School is a full-time job.  And managing your time is important.
</p><ul>
<li>If you have a &#34;real&#34; job after school
that you do just for fun (or for some extra spending money), or if
you participate in extra-curricular activities (whether
school-related or not), keep your priorities
in mind:  
<ul><b>Your education should come first!</b></ul>
</li><li>If you must work (in
order to make ends meet), you should realize the limitations that
this imposes on your study time.
<ul><a href="http://www.phdcomics.com" target="_blank">
<!--<img src="HOWTOSTUDY/phd110306s.gif"></a><br>-->
<img src="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd110306s.gif"/></a></ul>
</li><li>
How much time should you devote to studying?  
A recent
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/che.homework.html" target="_blank">survey
in the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i></a> suggested that students
are not studying enough. So, how much is enough?  
<ul>
<li>
If you assume that
your education is a full-time job, then you should spend about 40
hours/week on it.  Figure that 1 academic credit equals about 1
hour.  So, if you&#39;re taking 15 credits, then you&#39;re spending about 15
hours in class.  Subtracting that from 40 gives you 25 hours that you
should be spending studying at home (or in the library).
</li><li>
You should spread that out over the week.  Suppose you decide to study
Sunday through Thursday evenings, taking Fridays and Saturdays off (from
studying, that is).  Dividing that 25 hours by those 5 days gives you 5
hours of studying per night.  If you think that&#39;s too much, then plan on
studying in the afternoons, too, or some of Saturday.
</li><li>
The above are just rules of thumb.  If you&#39;re taking a 3-credit
independent-study course, but you meet with your instructor only 1 hour/week,
then you should add the extra 2 hours to your at-home study time.  If
you&#39;re working to earn some money, you should subtract your work hours
from your <i>free time</i>, not from your study time!  (If you don&#39;t
want to do that, then you should consider quitting your job or reducing
your course load.)
</li><li>
So, for instance, if you are a part-time student taking (say) 3 courses
worth a total of 9 credits
and working (say) 20 hours per week, then you have 20 hours per week for
your coursework (40 hours in a typical work-week minus 20 hours at your
job).  The 9 credits amount to approximately 9 hours in class.  So,
20 – 9 = 11 hours to spend at home studying.
That works out to about 2.2 hours (2 hours and 12 minutes, to be overly
precise) per day (in a 5-day week, using the assumption about no
studying on Fridays or Saturdays),
or about 0.7 hours (42 minutes) per course for 3
courses.
</li><li>
If that still seems like a lot, consider the difference between
high-school courses and college courses.  The typical high-school course
meets every day, for about 5 hours/week.  But the typical college course
meets only about 3 hours/week, yet is supposed to be more intensive than
its high-school counterpart.  That&#39;s because in college you&#39;re expected
to put more of your own time into studying.

</ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
2.2. Set yourself a grade goal.  If you don&#39;t meet it, cut down on
non-school activities.  (If you can&#39;t, because you&#39;re working for a
living, then consider dropping down to part-time schooling.)

<h3><a name="takenotes">3.1. Take Notes</a></h3><a name="takenotes">
Good studying at home begins with good notes taken in class.  
<p>Just as
different
students may have different learning or studying styles,
different teachers have different
teaching styles (and often these clash with the students&#39; learning styles!):  
</p><ul>
<li>Some teachers lecture, some lead discussions, some
&#34;facilitate&#34; individual work (as in a lab), etc.
</li></ul></a><p><a name="takenotes">
  Consequently,
different classroom settings will require different note-taking
techniques.
But the suggestions here are general enough to work in most situations.

</a><a name="compnotes">
</a></p><h3><a name="compnotes">3.2.  Take Complete Notes</a></h3><a name="compnotes">
The key idea of taking good notes in class is to
<b>write down as much as possible</b>.
There are several reasons to take notes that are as complete as possible:
<ol>
<li>It will force you to pay attention to what&#39;s going on in class.
</li><li>It will keep you awake (!)
</li><li>There will be less that you&#39;ll have to remember.
</li></ol>

<p>
Should you concentrate on <i>taking notes</i> or should you concentrate on
<i>understanding</i> what you are learning?  
</p></a><ul><a name="compnotes">
</a><li><a name="compnotes">Paradoxically, I&#39;d err on the
side of taking notes, not understanding!  
</a><ul><a name="compnotes">
</a><li><a name="compnotes">
Understanding can come later,
when you </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#copy">review your notes</a>.
</li><li>
But if you have incomplete notes, it will be
hard for you to learn what you didn&#39;t take notes on.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<a name="useabbrev">
<h3>3.3. Use Abbreviations</h3>
Taking complete notes will require you to write fairly quickly and, as a
consequence, to <i>use abbreviations</i>.  Here are some that I use (many of
which I borrowed from other students and teachers), to give you an idea of
how you can abbreviate. 
If you send text messages on your cell phone, then you know the sort of
abbreviations I&#39;m talking about. Use them when you take notes in
class!

</a><p><a name="useabbrev">
A related idea is  based on a system of shorthand called </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedwriting" target="_blank">Speedwriting</a>:  There used to be
ads in the New York City subway system that read something like this:
</p><ul>if u cn rd ths, u cn lrn spdwrtg</ul>

<p>
The key idea in abbreviating is to use abbreviations that will make sense
to <i>you</i>. You can put an abbreviation key in the margin of your
notebook for any abbreviations that you make up on the spot.

<a name="neatness">
</a></p><h3><a name="neatness">3.4.  Neatness Doesn&#39;t Count.</a></h3><a name="neatness">
Yet another key idea of note-taking is that you don&#39;t have to be
<i>neat</i>! You only have to be <i>legible enough</i> to be able to read
your notes a few hours (or, at most, a few days) later.  The reason for
this
will become clear </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#copy">later</a>.

<a name="askqns">
<h3>3.5. Ask Questions &amp; Make Comments</h3>
If you have a question or something comes to mind as you&#39;re taking notes,
you have two choices:  
<li>
You can contribute to the class discussion by
asking your question or making your comment.  
</li><li>Or you can jot your question
or comment down in your notes.  
<p>
I suggest always doing the latter, but
also doing the former as often as possible.  
</p></li><li>One reason that you should
always put your question or comment in your notes is so that you won&#39;t
forget it. You can then always bring it up later, either in class or
one-on-one with the teacher or a fellow student.
</li><li>
Another reason, of course, is that if you <i>do</i> bring it up in class,
it should thereby become part of the day&#39;s class notes!  
<p>
One technique
that I use to be able to distinguish my own questions or comments from the
rest of the notes is to put them in the margin and/or to surround them
with big, bold square brackets
<SPAN size="+5">[</SPAN>like this.<SPAN size="+5">]</SPAN>

</p><p>
By the way, if you have a question, especially if you need clarification
of something that the teacher said or wrote (possibly because it was
inaudible or illegible), <i>ask it</i>!  
</p></li><li>Do <i>not</i> be embarrassed about
asking it!  
</li><li>I can guarantee you that there will be at least one other
student in the class (and often many more) who will be extremely grateful
to you for having asked the very same question that they were too
embarrassed to ask. 
</li></a><li><a name="askqns">And they will come to view you as wise and brave for
having asked it.  (So will the teacher!)

<h3>3.6.  Copy Your Notes at Home</h3>
Recall that this section was titled &#34;Take Notes in Class &amp; <i>Rewrite</i>
Them at Home&#34;. 
<p>
The title was <i>not</i> &#34;Take Notes in Class &amp; <i>Study</i> Them
at Home&#34;.  
</p><p>Of course you should study your class notes at home; but just
(re-)<i>reading</i> them is too passive. 
</p><p>
One of the themes of this guide
is that</p><ul><b>STUDYING MUST BE <i>ACTIVE</i></b>.
</ul>
<p>
It is all too easy when
<i>just</i> reading passively to have your mind wander or even to fall
asleep:
</p></a><ul><a name="copy"></a><a href="https://www.gocomics.com/betty/2002/03/20" target="_blank">
<img src="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/betty.notetaking"/></a></ul>
<p>
Moreover, notes are often incomplete or sketchy; just reading
such notes won&#39;t help.  And a few days or months after you take them, they
may very well be illegible or incomprehensible.
Finally, if you don&#39;t do something active with your notes, you run the
risks of having unorganized notes or of misplacing them.

</p><p>
What I suggest is that you <b>study your notes by re-writing them</b>:
</p><ul>
<li>
For each class, buy a separate notebook from the one you take your notes in.
I recommend a &#34;composition&#34; or spiral notebook, not a looseleaf
notebook, for your &#34;permanent&#34; (i.e., re-written) notes.  
</li><li>
Then, as soon as
possible after class (preferably that evening or the next), copy your
notes into your permanent notebook.  
</li></ul>

<p>
The main idea behind re-writing your &#34;raw&#34; class notes (besides making
them more legible and organized) is that the very act of copying them is
one of the best ways of studying them!  Further study of your class notes
can then be done from these &#34;cooked&#34; ones that are neater, more legible,
more organized, and more complete.  I will suggest ways to do this <a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#examstudy">later</a>.

</p><p>
Use this opportunity to fill in gaps
from your memory while they are still fresh in mind.  You may find that
you have questions, perhaps something you missed or don&#39;t understand, or
even a &#34;substantive&#34; question.  If so, good!  Make a note of your
question and ask it in class next time!  

</p><p>
Use this opportunity to
(re-)organize your notes in a more logical or coherent fashion.  You could
write your permanent notes in an outline form if that seems suitable:  You
don&#39;t have to follow any &#34;official&#34; or formal outlining style (e.g.,
using the I.A.1.(a)(i) format or the (sometimes silly) rule that there
must always be at least two subsections, never just one) — after all,
these are <i>your</i> notes.  Personally, I like to number main ideas (and
separate them with a line), using
an &#34;indented bullet&#34; style for details:
</p><pre>1.  Main idea 1
    - detail 1
    - detail 2
      - further detail 2.1
    - detail 3
      - further detail 3.1
      - further detail 3.2
</pre>
<hr/>
<pre>2.  Main idea 2
</pre>
<hr/>
<pre>3.  Main idea 3
</pre>
<hr/>
etc.

<h3>3.7.  Don&#39;t Take Notes on a Computer</h3>
By the way, I do <i>not</i> recommend taking notes on a laptop
computer <i>during class</i>.  
</a></li><li><a name="computer">Certainly you should not do this unless you are a <i>very</i>
good typist and have &#34;compiled&#34; your word-processing or text-editing
program into your fingertips. 
</a></li><li><a name="computer"> (In any case, typing can be very noisy and
disturbing to your fellow students!)  
</a><p><a name="computer">
Also, typing class
notes into a computer file can be inconsistent with my recommendation to
</a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#copy">re-write your class notes</a>.
</p></li><li>Rewriting on a computer might have some advantages in terms of keeping
track of your notes or, especially, searching them.
</li><li>And, of course, you can <i>edit</i> your computer
file later, but editing is not the same as <i>copying</i>,
and I am recommending
copying as a means to studying (for one thing, it forces you to (re-)read
all your notes).  
</li><li>Of course, you <i>can</i> copy your raw notes into a
neater computer file; this may be a matter of taste, but I find that I
have a firmer grasp of what I write if I handwrite it than if I type it.
</li><li>(As Usama Fayyad has said:
computers are &#34;great at bookkeeping
but not yet great at recording impromptu
ideas, thoughts, feelings. For that, paper
is still far superior. You can hold it, fold
it, put it in your pocket, look at it again
later when it&#39;s convenient&#34; (as quoted in
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#swerdlow">Swerdlow 1999</a>: 130).)
</li><li>Moreover, the main use of your notes should be for summarizing them to
make
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#outline">a study guide for exams</a>.
</li><li>In that case, handwritten notes would serve as well as online ones,
especially if you&#39;re tempted to create the summary merely by cutting and
pasting your computer file rather than by rewriting.
<p>
Worse, you may be tempted to use the computer that you&#39;re ostensibly
taking notes on to surf the Internet, look at email, or chat with
friends. Don&#39;t!  (For an interesting debate on this topic, see
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#adams2006">Adams 2006</a>.)
</p><p>
For that matter, turn off your computer in class.  And your iPod.  And
your cell phone.  And your pager.  And anything else that might distract
you.  For reasons why, see:

<b>When should you study or do your homework?</b>
<ul><li>
It&#39;s tempting to put
off your homework to the last minute.
There are at least two good reasons to do your homework as soon
as possible and not put it off till the evening, when it&#39;s not daylight
(although you should certainly take a break between the end 
of the school day and before starting your homework):
	<ol>
	<li>It&#39;s better to get it done and over with, and to leave yourself
enough time to do it all.  
<ul>
<li>If you put it off, you may find that you
have an assignment or two that are going to take you a lot longer than
you thought they would.  
</li><li>If you start early and get your work done
before you relax, you&#39;ll have enough time for even those hard
assignments
(even if it means not having enough time to Facebook or play videogames
or read for fun).  
</li><li>The general principle is:
Don&#39;t eat your dessert first!
</li></ul>
</li><li>You&#39;re more awake during the daytime or after relaxing for, say,
an hour or so after classes end, than you will be at the end of the day
just before going to sleep.

<h3>5.1. Read Actively, Not Passively</h3>
Whatever you have to read  —  whether it&#39;s a text book, a
work of fiction, a poem, an essay, an article from a journal or magazine,
or even a class handout  —  <b>read it slowly and
actively</b>:
</a><ul><a name="active"></a><li><a name="active">
With </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#exception">one major exception</a>, you should not
read passively.  
</li><li>That is, don&#39;t just read the text straight through
without thinking about what you&#39;re reading.  
<ul><a href="https://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/1972/03/28" target="_blank">
<img width="50%" src="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/peanuts.word.a.day.png"/></a></ul>
<p>
If you read without thinking, I guarantee that
your mind will eventually wander off, your eyes will eventually glaze
over, and you will fall asleep—it&#39;s a form of self-hypnosis.
</p><ul><li>
So you must read actively.  
</li><li>To use computer jargon, you must turn the
inert medium of text on paper to an <i>interactive</i> medium, in which you have
a &#34;conversation&#34; with the text, as you might if you could be talking to
the author.  
</li></ul>
</li></ul>


<a name="slow">
<h3>5.2. Read Slowly.</h3>
<p>
&#34;…an undeniable truth:  that in the pursuit of knowledge, slower
can be better.&#34;
</p></a><ul><a name="slow"></a><a href="http://www.gocomics.com/ziggy/2004/11/22" target="_blank">
<img width="15%" src="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/ziggy-slowReading.gif"/></a></ul>
<p>
The first step in reading actively is to read <i>s-l-o-w-l-y</i>.  Here is
an algorithm (i.e., a procedure) for
how to read any text, in any subject, slowly and actively:

</p><ul>
<pre>WHILE there is a next sentence to read, DO:
  BEGIN { while }
    Read it, SLOWLY;
    IF you do not understand it, THEN
      BEGIN { if }
        re-read the previous material, SLOWLY;
        re-read the incomprehensible sentence, SLOWLY;
        IF you still don&#39;t understand it, THEN
           ask a fellow student to explain it;
        IF you still don&#39;t understand it, THEN
           ask your Teaching Assistant (TA) to explain it;
        IF you still don&#39;t understand it, THEN
           ask me;
        IF you are in an upper-level course &amp; you still don&#39;t understand it, THEN
           write a paper about it (!)
      END { if } 
END; { while }
</pre>
</ul><p>
Since there is no next sentence (because the Boolean test in the
WHILE is false), you&#39;ve understood the text!
</p><p>
For those of you who may not be familiar with how to read structured
computer programs such as this one, here&#39;s how it goes:
</p><ul>
<li>
In a &#34;while&#34; statement, if the initial test is false, then the rest of
the statement is not executed.
</li><li>
So, if you are at the beginning or the middle of reading a text, there
<i>will</i> be a &#34;next&#34; sentence, so you <i>do</i> execute the rest of the
statement, which says to read that next sentence slowly, etc.
</li><li>
However, if you have finished reading the entire text (and, hopefully,
have now understood it), then there is <i>no</i> next sentence, so you are
finished!   
</li><li>
(The words in braces, like &#34;{ while }&#34;,
are just computer-programming notation for a comment that is intended
for human readers of a computer program but that is ignored by the
computer.)
</li></ul>
<p>
This algorithm has three major advantages:

</p><ol>
<li>
It forces you to actively think about each sentence you read
before you go on to read the next one.
</li><li>
It slows you down,
so that you don&#39;t read past the point at which you don&#39;t understand.
This is especially important in mathematical and scientific subjects.
</li><li>
It can help you get help from your teacher, because you can show your
teacher exactly where you got lost.  
<ul>
<li>It is always much better to show
your teacher exactly what it is that you don&#39;t understand than
it is to
just say that you don&#39;t understand the material.
</li></ul>
</li><li>
Note that it also provides you an opportunity to interact with your
instructors and fellow students!
</li></ol>
<p>
How do you know whether you understand what you&#39;ve read?  Easy:  After
each sentence, ask yourself &#34;Why?&#34; (Pressley &amp; El-Dinary 1992).

<a name="highlighting">
<h3>5.3.  Highlight the Text in the Margin</h3>
There are some other tricks for active reading.  One, of course, is to
highlight important or interesting passages.  There are several ways to do
this: 
</a><ul><a name="highlighting">
</a><li><a name="highlighting"> The <i>worst</i> is to use a <mark>yellow highlighting marker</mark> (or hot
pink, or whatever color you like). 
</a><ul><a name="highlighting"><li>
The main problem with this is that you
will tend to find almost every sentence to be important or interesting.
</li><li>
As a consequence, every page will become yellow (or hot pink, or
whatever).  
</li><li>
Not only does this defeat the purpose of highlighting — because
if <i>everything</i> has been highlighted, then really <i>nothing</i> has
been! — but the pages of your text will become damp, curl up, and be
generally messy.
</li></a><li><a name="highlighting">
This technique can have other problems, too:
</a><ul><a name="highlighting"></a><a href="http://gocomics.com/betty/" target="_blank">
<img width="45%" src="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/betty.highlighting.gif"/></a></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
A slightly less messy, but equally useless, technique is to use a pen or
pencil to <u>underline</u> important or interesting passages.  
<ul><li>I guarantee
that you will wind up underlining every sentence on every page, and you
will have gained nothing.
</li></ul>

</li><li>
The technique that I suggest is also susceptible to this problem, but has
a built-in way to overcome it, so that you can
re-read the text, highlighting different passages each
time.  
<ul>
<li>
The trick is to <b>highlight a passage by drawing a <i>vertical
line</i> in the margin.</b>
<ul><li>I like to use the right margin and to make my
line a right square bracket: <SPAN size="+20">]</SPAN>  
</li><li>If you want to make it
clear [exactly
where the highlighted passage begins or ends,] you can use small square
brackets in the text,
as I did in this sentence,
along with the vertical line in the margin.
</li><li>
This way, even if you&#39;ve
slipped into the error of highlighting (i.e., vertical-lining)
every sentence on every page, at
least you haven&#39;t ruined the page.  
</li><li>
Moreover, when you re-read the text
 — 
note that I said &#39;when&#39;, not &#39;if&#39; :-)
 — 
you can then use a different
highlighting technique (e.g., underlining) to highlight more important
passages.  
</li><li>Sometimes, I use double brackets in the margin for this second
round of highlighting: <SPAN size="+20">]</SPAN><b>]</b>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>


<a name="marginalnotes">
<h3>5.4. Make Notes in the Margin</h3>
You should also make notes in the margin of the text (<i>if</i> there&#39;s
room, and <i>if</i> the text belongs to you).  
<ul><li>I like to put
cross-references in the margin; e.g., if a passage on p. 20 reminds me in
some way of a passage on p. 10, I&#39;ll write &#34;see p. 10&#34;
in the margin on
p. 20, and &#34;see p. 20&#34; in the margin on p. 10.  
</li><li>Or I&#39;ll put some keyword
in the margin if a passage reminds me of some major idea.  
</li></ul>

<p>
But now suppose that a few months (or a few years) later, you want to find
that interesting passage that related to, say, consciousness; how will you
find it?  
</p><ul><li>
You could, of course, page through the book till you find it,
but what I like to do is to make an index of my marginal comments. 
</li><li>You can
add entries 
(e.g., Consciousness:  10, 20)
to the book&#39;s index if it already has one,
or use a  blank page at the end of the book if it doesn&#39;t have an index.
</li></ul>

</a><a name="notebook">
<h3>5.5.  Keep a Notebook</h3>
Highlighting has the disadvantage that it
can lead you to highlight everything, and margins have the disadvantage
that they are often too
small for making comments.  
</a><ul><a name="notebook"><li>
The best technique for active reading is
to keep a notebook.  
</li><li>In addition to (or instead of) highlighting a
passage, copy it
 — 
<i>verbatim</i>
 — 
into your notebook.  
</li></a><li><a name="notebook">Be sure to begin
your notebook with a full
</a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtowrite.html#citations" target="_blank"> citation</a> to the text
for use in a bibliography, and
be sure to write down the page numbers of each passage that you copy.
</li><li>
Then, write down
 — 
at length and in detail
 — 
your comments on the passage.
</li><li>
(I sometimes like to use a pen for the text and a pencil for my
commentary.) 
</li></ul>

<p>
<a name="ident">
These notes can then be used later if you write a term paper
or research paper that discusses the material in the text.  
</a></p><ul><li><a name="ident">
For that
purpose, it will be useful to number your notes.  
</a></li><li><a name="ident">
I find the following
scheme useful:  Number each notebook
page with a
</a><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22roman+numerals%22" target="_blank">Roman numeral</a>
(I, II, etc.), number each quoted
passage (or stand-alone comment) with an Arabic numeral (1, 2, etc.),
and letter (a, b, etc.) each
comment associated with a quoted passage (or stand-alone comment).  
</li><li>Then
you can refer to each passage with an identifier (like XIV-7-b, i.e.,
comment b about quotation 7, which comment is located on notebook page
XIV) that will
enable you to find it later.

<a name="exception">
<h3>5.6. Read Literature Quickly and Passively the First Time.</h3>
</a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#active">Earlier</a>, I said that there was an exception to this
method of slow and active reading:  
<ul><li>
If the text is a work of literature (a
story, novel, play, poem, etc.), then it is often best to read it once all the
way through without stopping, just as you would read something for fun,
so that you get to know what it&#39;s about and can appreciate it
as a work of literature.  
</li><li>
(If there&#39;s a recording of it, you might find it
helpful to listen to the recording <i>while reading the text</i>. I have
found this especially useful for Shakespeare.)
</li><li>
Then you can use the slow
and active reading techniques for a second (or third, or fourth, or
…) reading when you are studying the text.
</li><li>
Actually, even for non-fiction, it can be useful to read the text
through once, quickly, to get an overview, perhaps making notes if
something strikes you, and then doing the slow and active reading
techniques when you are studying the text.
</li></ul>

<p>
What about film or video versions?  
</p><ul><li>
They can be helpful but, in general,
of course are no substitute for reading.  
</li><li>The exception here is for plays,
which are intended to be seen, not (just) read.  
</li><li>If you do decide to watch
in addition to read, which should you do first?  
<ul><li>I prefer watching first,
reading afterwards.  
</li><li>I have almost always been disappointed by film
adaptations of favorite texts (because they don&#39;t match the mental images
that I construct when I read), but I have almost never been disappointed
by a text after watching a film adaptation.  
</li><li>Besides, if you watch first
and read later, the adaptation can help you visualize what you&#39;re
reading.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<a name="before">
<h3>5.7. Read Before and After Class</h3>
Ideally, you should read a text at least twice:  
</a><ul><a name="before"><li>
Read it (perhaps
quickly) <i>before</i> the class in which it will be discussed, so that
you are familiar with its contents.  
</li></a><li><a name="before">
Then (re-)read it <i>after</i>
class using the </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#slow">slow and active method</a>. 
</li><li>
 If time
permits, you can cut corners by only reading it—slowly
and actively!—<i>after</i> class.

</ul>
<p>
Science and math courses (and some others, such as foreign-language
courses) often require you to do homework exercises or problem sets.  
</p><ul><li>
I strongly recommend that you do <i>not</i> simply do the problems and hand
them in.  
</li><li>
Rather, <b>do them on scrap paper, check them over, and then
<i>copy them neatly</i>.  </b>
</li><li>
Turn in the neat copy (and, of course, be sure
that your name is on it!).
</li><li>
You may
even want to duplicate your work in case the teacher loses it (unlikely)
or doesn&#39;t give it back in time to use it for studying for an exam (this
should only happen in rare circumstances, usually just before an exam
(when the teacher has a lot of things to do),
but it is not unheard of).

And don&#39;t just write down <i>answers</i>.  Write down the problem <i>and</i> the
complete solution showing <i>how</i> you arrived at your answer.

</li><li><a name="choosetopic">Avoid the two extremes of a topic that is so

teacher.

</a><a name="research">
<h3>9.2.  Do Research</h3>
Once you have a topic and have found appropriate resource materials,
</a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#readactively">read
them slowly and actively</a>, and be sure to 
<a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#notebook">keep a  notebook</a>.
</li><li>
I won&#39;t repeat the details of those suggestions here, with one exception:
Be sure to carefully record your sources and the page numbers of any
quotations, so that you can include them in your final report.

<a name="makeoutline">
<h3>9.3.  Make an Outline</h3>
This stage may require several iterations.  
</a></li><li><a name="makeoutline">You should make an
outline and sort your notes into categories that correspond to the main
sections of your outline.  
</a></li><li><a name="makeoutline">But which of these should you do
first?  It doesn&#39;t matter.
<ul><li>
You may have a clear outline in mind, in which case, sorting your notes
will be relatively straightforward (though  you may find that some notes
don&#39;t quite fit or that some suggest a section that you hadn&#39;t initially
thought of).  
</li><li>Or you may need to sort your notes
first, to see which ones go together, and <i>then</i> create an outline
based on the categories you discover during the sorting process.
</li></ul>

<p>
How do you make an outline?  The suggestions that follow work for almost
anything you have to write. 

</p></a></li><li><a name="makeoutline">First, write down a handful of main themes
that you want to discuss (these will be the categories that you sorted
your notes into); describe each using only a few keywords.  
</a></li><li><a name="makeoutline">Decide
in
what order you want to write about them, and then—on a blank piece of
paper—put each at the head of a column, something like this:
<ul>
<u>intro</u>  <u>topic1</u>  <u>topic2</u>  <u>topic3</u>  <u>conclusion</u>
</ul>
<p>
These will be the main sections of your paper.  In addition,
you should always have an
introductory section and a conclusion or summary section.

</p></a></li><li><a name="makeoutline">
Next, in each column, write down the main ideas that you want to include,
again ordering them and using just a few keywords.  
</a><ul><a name="makeoutline"><li>These will be your
subsections.  
</li></a><li><a name="makeoutline">
Under each of these, put the </a><a href="https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html#ident">identifying numbers</a>
of the items in your
notes that you want to include in each subsection.  
<ul><li>
(You may find that you
will need to repeat this process recursively for subsubsections, etc. 
</li><li> If
so, do this when you&#39;re ready to write that subsection, not at the
beginning.  
</li><li>This kind of process is called &#34;top-down design and stepwise
refinement&#34;.)
</li></ul>
</li></ul>

<h3>9.4. Write, Using Your Outline</h3>
</a><ul><a name="write">
</a><a href="http://oceanflynn.wordpress.com/2007/04/21/how-can-i-tell-what-i-think-until-i-see-what-i-say/" target="_blank">
&#34;How can I tell what I think until I see what I say?&#34;</a>
</ul>
<p>
Once you&#39;ve got your outline, start writing, using your outline and notes
as a guide.  
</p></li><li>Don&#39;t spend too much time editing what you write at this
stage.  Just write.  
</li><li>(I should note that some people prefer
<a href="http://wiki.ehow.com/Freewrite" target="_blank">
&#34;free writing&#34;
</a>, in which you <i>don&#39;t</i> spend any time preparing an outline
before you write.  If that works for you, go for it.)

<p>
By the way, it&#39;s always helpful for keeping track of where
you are in your outline, both to you as writer and
to your reader, to give each section and subsection a name, as I have done
in this document.
