    <h1>I can&#39;t use my number pad for 2FA codes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><a href="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Computer-number-pad-with-the-number-7-in-the-top-left-fs8.png" itemprop="https://schema.org/image"></a><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody"><p>This has to be the most infuriating bug report I&#39;ve ever submitted.</p><p>I went to type in my 2FA code on a website - but no numbers appeared on screen. Obviously, I was an idiot and had forgotten to press the NumLock button. D&#39;oh! I toggled it on and typed again. No numbers appeared. I switched to another tab, my numbers appeared when I typed them. So I was reasonably confident that my keyboard was working.</p><p>I swapped back to the 2FA entry and tried again. Still nothing.  Then I tried typing the numbers using the number row on my keyboard. My 2FA code appeared.</p><p>WHAT IN THE SAINTED NAME OF ALPHONSE CHAPANIS IS GOING ON?!?!?</p><p>Developers often use JavaScript to &#34;improve&#34; the standard features of HTML.  For example, using <code>&lt;input type=&#34;number&#34;&gt;</code> has some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/number#accessibility_concerns">accessibility concerns</a> and using <a href="https://css-tricks.com/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-inputmode/#aa-numeric"><code>inputmode=&#34;numeric&#34;</code></a> is great for showing a number key board on mobile, but not much else.</p><p>So a developer wants a reliable way to make sure a user can <em>only</em> type numbers. Fair enough.</p><p>There are two ways to do this - a right way and a wrong way - using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent"><code>KeyboardEvent</code></a>.</p><p>One way is to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key">listen for the character being sent from the keyboard</a> - known as the <code>key</code>.</p><p>The other is to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code">listen for the <em>button</em> being pressed on the keyboard</a> - known as the <code>code</code>.</p><p>A good demo of this is at <a href="https://keyjs.dev/">keyjs.dev</a> - play around with it to see what keyboard buttons your browser can detect.</p><p>When I press 7 on the top row of my keyboard, the key is 7 and the code is <strong><code>Digit7</code></strong>.</p><p>But when I press 7 on my number pad, the key is 7 but the code is <strong><code>Numpad7</code></strong>.</p><p>The JavaScript on the website was rejecting any key code which wasn&#39;t a &#34;Digit&#34;!</p><p>Perhaps I am a weirdo for insisting on both having and using my numpad?  Perhaps developers need to test on something other than MacBooks? Perhaps JavaScript was a mistake and the Web would be better without it?</p><p>Either way, don&#39;t be like that website. Let users type in using whatever keys they like.</p></div></article></div>
