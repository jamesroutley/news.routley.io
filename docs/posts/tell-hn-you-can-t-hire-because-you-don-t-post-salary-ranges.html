    <h1>Tell HN: You can&#39;t hire because you don&#39;t post salary ranges</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>At the start of this year, Colorado has changed to require every job posted to list a salary range. Other states are also beginning to follow suit.<p>I am currently job hunting. I started looking locally, everything lists salary ranges, perfect. I can know which positions to skip and which ones might be a good match right away. No need to waste time with 7 rounds of interviewing only to find out the salary is 50% of what I currently make.</p><p>Now I&#39;ve begun widening my search to remote work, as the idea of commuting to an office in 2022 is completely insane to me.</p><p>Most jobs on nation-wide job boards do not post a salary range. I will not even click on those job postings. It&#39;s simply not worth it.</p><p>Further, after seeing so many positions listed _with_ salary ranges, when I see one without a salary range it makes me feel like you have something to hide and are trying to trick me.</p><p>So the next time your team starts discussing why you can&#39;t seem to hire, maybe ask if you are publicly posting salary ranges on these positions?</p></div></div>
