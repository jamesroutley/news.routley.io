<p>Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak had some harsh words for Tesla’s self-driving effort; he said in an interview that people who want to study “AI trying to kill you” should “get a Tesla.”</p>



<p>Wozniak has somewhat of a love-hate relationship with Tesla. It looks like it’s tilting more toward hate over the last few years, though “hate” is probably too strong of a word.</p>



<p>The Apple cofounder first bought a Model S after he claimed that Tesla CEO Elon Musk reprimanded him in an email exchange for buying a gas guzzler in 2013.</p>



<p>He often publicly commented about his enthusiasm for the electric vehicle and especially his visits to Tesla’s Superchargers.</p>



<p>But he later bought a Chevy Bolt EV and started a debate about <a href="https://electrek.co/2016/09/07/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-says-trading-tesla-model-s-chevy-bolt-ev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">considering making it his daily driver</a>, thus replacing his Tesla. Yet Woz ended up<a href="https://electrek.co/2016/12/16/apple-steve-wozniak-tesla-chevy-bolt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> buying a second Model S</a> after Tesla released Autopilot 2.0., which <a href="https://electrek.co/2017/10/25/tesla-autopilot-attacks-apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-einhorn-media/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the engineer has been critical of over the years</a>.</p>



<p>Now he ramped up his criticism of Tesla’s self-driving effort. When talking about Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s statements promising self-driving capabilities through future software updates during a new CNN interview, Wozniak implied that Tesla vehicles on FSD are trying to “kill” people:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I actually believed those things, and it’s not even close to reality. And boy, if you want a study of AI gone wrong and taking a lot of claims and trying to kill you every chance it can, get a Tesla.</p>
</blockquote>




	<p>It looks like Woz is not scared of <a href="https://electrek.co/2023/04/19/tesla-hires-new-top-lawyer-lead-scary-hardcore-litigation-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla’s “hardcore litigation” team</a>, which has been a bit trigger-happy when it comes to <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/30/tesla-starts-suing-former-customers-defamation-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suing people for defamation</a> lately.</p>



<p>While “trying to kill you” is a bit harsh, the famed engineer is not wrong that there are issues with Tesla’s Full Self-Driving beta, which <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/02/04/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-crash-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have resulted in accidents</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>I think the comment is really tongue-in-cheek because a bad performance from Tesla FSD Beta is not really what people mean when they talk about concerns of AI being fatal to humans, but I think his criticism is still valid.</p>



<p>As he said, he is one of those that believed Musk when he made the FSD promises, and now he is disillusioned about it – that I can relate to.</p>
