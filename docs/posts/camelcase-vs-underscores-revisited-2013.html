		<p>It has been 2 years since I published <a href="https://whathecode.wordpress.com/2011/02/10/camelcase-vs-underscores-scientific-showdown/">“CamelCase vs underscores: Scientific showdown”</a>, and it still is easily the most visited article on this blog. Yesterday alone it got 2,614 views thanks to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5224531">a forum post on Y Combinator</a>, pretty much suppressing my normal visit rates entirely. What is it that makes it such a hot topic? Honestly, it doesn’t interest me that much anymore since there are many more important ways by which to make your code more readable; note it <em>is</em> <strong>code comprehension</strong> we are talking about here, not how fast you can write code! Before I <a href="https://whathecode.wordpress.com/2011/11/13/the-code-formatting-fallacy/">outlined how the entire discussion could be made obsolete by moving away from a textual representation of code</a>, and in my previous post <a href="https://whathecode.wordpress.com/2012/12/02/learning-from-linguistics/">I related software design principles as an act of communication to the cooperative principle in Linguistics</a>. Nonetheless, given the immense interest this article seems to be getting I feel it’s my obligation to report on follow-up research of the previously discussed paper <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5090039&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F5073941%2F5090011%2F05090039.pdf%3Farnumber%3D5090039">“To camelcase or under_score”</a> by Binkley et al. (2009) (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.158.9499&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>In <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5521745&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5521745">“An Eye Tracking Study on camelCase and under_score Identifier Syles”</a> by Sharif and Maletic (2010) (<a href="http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf">PDF</a>) the previous study is replicated but deviates from it in a few points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only programmers are used as subjects.</li>
<li>All of the subjects had experience with both styles and their preference of style was approximately split even among the groups.</li>
<li>Most of the subjects were historically trained in the underscore style. (The opposite was true in the study by Binkley et al.)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_tracking">Eye tracking</a> is used to measure fixation count and rate. Results from previous eye tracking studies in the domain of cognitive psychology imply that camel-cased identifiers should be more difficult to read compared to underscored identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>No difference in accuracy</strong> was reported (as opposed to Binkley et al.), but on average, <strong>camel-cased identifiers took 932ms (20%) longer</strong> than underscored identifiers, in line with the 13,5% longer as reported by Binkley et al. The eye tracking results also give some insight into <em>visual effort</em>. <strong>Camel-cased identifiers require a higher average duration of fixations.</strong></p>
<p>When interested into the details of the studies, don’t forget to read the papers yourself. I linked to them for your convenience, but if the links break you can easily find them by looking up their titles on <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a>.</p>
<p>It seems in general the subject has gotten more attention over the past 2 years in research. You can find relevant resources yourself by checking out the ‘Citing Documents’ of the discussed papers, but here are a few interesting ones:</p>

			I have a PhD in Human-Computer Interaction and am currently working both as a software engineer at iMotions and as a postdoc at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). This blend of research and development is the type of work which motivates and excites me the most. Currently, I am working on a distributed platform which enables researchers to conduct biometric research &#39;in the wild&#39; (outside of the lab environment).

I have almost 10 years of professional software development experience. Prior to academia, I worked for several years as a professional full-stack software developer at a game development company in Belgium: AIM Productions. I liked the work and colleagues at the company too much to give up entirely for further studies, so I decided to combine the two. In 2009 I started studying for my master in Game and Media Technology at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, from which I graduated in 2012.			<a href="https://whatheco.de/author/whathecode/" rel="author">
