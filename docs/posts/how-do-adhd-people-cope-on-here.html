    <h1>Ask HN: How do ADHD people cope on here?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I love HN. I check it out basically for hours every day, for the past 5 years or so.</p><p>But, HN is utter hell too… it’s worse than my addiction to The Guardian.</p><p>I see so many topics I’m interested in, so many cool projects, so I bookmark them. Then I see more and bookmark them too. There’s a never ending number of things I bookmark.</p><p>But the constant reality is that I will never ever be able to do all the things in my brain. It’s a severely frustrating and depressing fact I feel faced with every day. A world of highs and disappointment.</p><p>But I’m totally addicted because there’s just so much new.</p><p>Anyone else with ADHD feel this way or have a healthier outlook about HN?</p></div></div></div>
