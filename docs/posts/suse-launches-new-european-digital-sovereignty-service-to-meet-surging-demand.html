In the last few months, local EU governments, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-city-is-dumping-microsoft-office-and-windows-for-onlyoffice-and-linux-heres-why/">including the city of Lyon in France,</a> the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-german-state-schleswig-holstein-uninstalls-windows/">German state of Schleswig-Holstein</a>, and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-denmark-is-dumping-microsoft-office-and-windows-for-libreoffice-and-linux/">Denmark,</a> have begun their move to Linux and open-source software from <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-11-usage-is-surging-not-so-fast-heres-the-real-story/">Microsoft Windows</a> and Office. Now, Luxembourg-based European open-source powerhouse <a href="https://www.suse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SUSE</a> is offering extensive support to businesses and governments that want to keep their IT infrastructure inside the European Union.</p><p><strong>Also: </strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/7-things-every-linux-beginner-should-know-before-downloading-their-first-distro/"><strong>7 things every Linux beginner should know before downloading their first distro</strong></a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.suse.com/solutions/digital-sovereignty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Sovereignty</a> movement is a big deal in Europe for a reason. Today, over 90% of European data resides on servers operated by non-EU and primarily American companies. This dependency exposes EU entities to data privacy, economic leverage, and potential risks of foreign surveillance.</p><p>As a result, according to tech researcher IDC, <a href="https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=EUR151641724" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">84% of European organizations using cloud technologies are either currently using or planning to use sovereign cloud solutions</a>. Rahiel Nasir, IDC&#39;s research director for European Cloud Strategies, described 2025 as a &#34;watershed year,&#34; with growing geopolitical and economic uncertainties putting digital sovereignty at the forefront for organizations.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linuxs-remarkable-journey-from-one-devs-hobby-to-40-million-lines-of-code-and-counting/">Linux&#39;s remarkable journey from one dev&#39;s hobby to 40 million lines of code - and counting</a></strong></p><p>That&#39;s why SUSE, a global leader in enterprise open-source solutions, has announced the launch of its Sovereign Premium Support package. This comprehensive support service is designed to meet the growing demand for digital sovereignty. </p><!----><p>Specifically, Dirk-Peter (DP) van Leeuwen, SUSE&#39;s CEO, explained: &#34;For some, it&#39;s a brand new story. But for us, <a href="https://www.suse.com/c/championing-digital-sovereignty-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">digital sovereignty</a> is old news. We&#39;ve been enabling it for years for our customers. Along the way, we&#39;ve learned you have to get three main things right: Data, technology, and operations. The last area -- business operations -- is often least looked at, but it&#39;s often the hardest to deliver. Ultimately, it is about the people -- where are they? And how do we ensure we have the scale to deliver business continuity? That&#39;s what we&#39;re addressing with the launch of SUSE Sovereign Premium Support.&#34;</p><p><strong>Also: </strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-put-linux-on-this-8-inch-mini-laptop-and-unlocked-a-new-way-of-computing/"><strong>I put Linux on this 8-inch mini laptop, and unlocked a new way of computing</strong></a></p><p>In practice, SUSE&#39;s Sovereign Premium Support is tailored for enterprises and public sector organizations that require strict data residency, privacy, and operational control within the EU. The service ensures that:</p><ul><li>All support personnel and data are based in the EU, with named premium support engineers and service delivery managers assigned to each customer.</li><li>Customer support data is stored exclusively on EU-located networks and servers, addressing both regulatory and geopolitical concerns.</li><li>Access to sensitive data is strictly limited to EU-based staff, with a commitment to encrypting all data required for troubleshooting.</li></ul><p>This approach directly responds to the evolving landscape of European regulations and the heightened focus on digital independence. While it&#39;s an approach meant specifically for areas such as defense, government, and law enforcement, where compliance and resilience are paramount, it&#39;s being offered to all European organizations. </p><p>As Udo Wuertz, CDO and fellow at the data center company <a href="https://www.fsastech.com/en-eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fsas Technologies Europe</a>, said, SUSE&#39;s &#34;Open by Design, Sovereign by Choice&#34; philosophy, combined with enhanced EU-based support, provides tailored solutions for customers with stringent sovereignty requirements.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/cant-upgrade-your-windows-10-pc-here-are-your-options-before-it-all-ends-in-3-months/">Can&#39;t upgrade your Windows 10 PC? Here are your options before it all ends in 3 months</a></strong></p><p>If this focus sounds paranoid, well, the world has changed. There&#39;s more geopolitical uncertainty today than since the Cold War threatened to get hot. So, for Europeans, SUSE&#39;s new program may be just what they need to feel secure again. SUSE stands ready to help with its Linux, open-source, and cloud offerings. <a href="https://www.suse.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Contact SUSE</a> to learn more about their latest service.</p></div></div></div>
