<span>Key Points</span></p><p><strong>Question</strong> 
    <span>Does a repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) intervention prevent incident myopia among children with premyopia?</span></p><p><strong>Findings</strong> 
    <span>In this randomized clinical trial including 278 school-aged children with premyopia, the incidence of myopia was lower among children receiving RLRL therapy than among controls.</span></p><p><strong>Meaning</strong> 
    <span>Exposure to RLRL is a novel and effective intervention for myopia prevention among children with premyopia, with good user acceptability and safety.</span></p>            
<p><strong>Importance</strong> 
    <span>Myopia is a global concern, but effective prevention measures remain limited. Premyopia is a refractive state in which children are at higher risk of myopia, meriting preventive interventions.</span></p><p><strong>Objective</strong> 
    <span>To assess the efficacy and safety of a repeated low-level red-light (RLRL) intervention in preventing incident myopia among children with premyopia.</span></p><p><strong>Design, Setting, and Participants</strong> 
    <span>This was a 12-month, parallel-group, school-based randomized clinical trial conducted in 10 primary schools in Shanghai, China. A total of 139 children with premyopia (defined as cycloplegic spherical equivalence refraction [SER] of −0.50 to 0.50 diopter [D] in the more myopic eye and having at least 1 parent with SER ≤−3.00 D) in grades 1 to 4 were enrolled between April 1, 2021, and June 30, 2021; the trial was completed August 31, 2022.</span></p><p><strong>Interventions</strong> 
    <span>Children were randomly assigned to 2 groups after grade stratification. Children in the intervention group received RLRL therapy twice per day, 5 days per week, with each session lasting 3 minutes. The intervention was conducted at school during semesters and at home during winter and summer vacations. Children in the control group continued usual activities.</span></p><p><strong>Main Outcomes and Measures</strong> 
    <span>The primary outcome was the 12-month incidence rate of myopia (defined as SER ≤−0.50 D). Secondary outcomes included the changes in SER, axial length, vision function, and optical coherence tomography scan results over 12 months. Data from the more myopic eyes were analyzed. Outcomes were analyzed by means of an intention-to-treat method and per-protocol method. The intention-to-treat analysis included participants in both groups at baseline, while the per-protocol analysis included participants in the control group and those in the intervention group who were able to continue the intervention without interruption by the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p><p><strong>Results</strong> 
    <span>There were 139 children (mean [SD] age, 8.3 [1.1] years; 71 boys [51.1%]) in the intervention group and 139 children (mean [SD] age, 8.3 [1.1] years; 68 boys [48.9%]) in the control group. The 12-month incidence of myopia was 40.8% (49 of 120) in the intervention group and 61.3% (68 of 111) in the control group, a relative 33.4% reduction in incidence. For children in the intervention group who did not have treatment interruption secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence was 28.1% (9 of 32), a relative 54.1% reduction in incidence. The RLRL intervention significantly reduced the myopic shifts in terms of axial length and SER compared with the control group (mean [SD] axial length, 0.30 [0.27] mm vs 0.47 [0.25] mm; difference, 0.17 mm [95% CI, 0.11-0.23 mm]; mean [SD] SER, –0.35 [0.54] D vs –0.76 [0.60] D; difference, –0.41 D [95% CI, –0.56 to –0.26 D]). No visual acuity or structural damage was noted on optical coherence tomography scans in the intervention group.</span></p><p><strong>Conclusions and Relevance</strong> 
    <span>In this randomized clinical trial, RLRL therapy was a novel and effective intervention for myopia prevention, with good user acceptability and up to 54.1% reduction in incident myopia within 12 months among children with premyopia.</span></p><p><strong>Trial Registration</strong>

            <p>This 12-month, 2-group, single-blinded, school-based randomized clinical trial was conducted in Shanghai, China. Children from 10 primary schools were enrolled between April 1, 2021, and June 30, 2021. Examinations were conducted at baseline and at the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up visits. This trial was completed August 31, 2022.

            <p>Eligible participants were primary school students in grades 1 to 4 (aged 6-11 years) with premyopia, defined as a cycloplegic spherical equivalent refraction (SER) of the more myopic eye in the range of −0.50 to 0.50 (inclusive) diopters (D) and having at least 1 parent with an SER in either eye of −3.00 D or less.

                        </div>
            <p>The randomization was stratified by grade and allocated to individuals at a ratio of 1:1. The randomization list was generated using R software, version 3.6 (R Group for Statistical Computing). To avoid stigmatization for being selected or not, children, parents, and teachers were educated on the purpose of the study and randomization. They were also informed of the right to withdraw at any time. Children and their guardians were aware of the study allocation due to the nature of the intervention. Outcome assessors and statisticians were masked.</p>            
            <p>Children in the intervention group received the RLRL intervention, while those in the control group did not. The RLRL intervention was provided by a desktop device (Eyerising, Suzhou Xuanjia Optoelectronics Technology; eFigure 1 in <a data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-supplemental" href="#note-ZOI230304-1">Supplement 2</a>), which consists of semiconductor laser diodes and delivers low-level red light with a mean (SD) wavelength of 650 (10) nm.

                        </div>
            <p>During semesters, children in the intervention group completed treatment at school. During summer and winter vacations, guardians were trained by teachers to supervise the intervention at home. The device was linked to the internet with an automated diary function to record the treatment history. In addition, 2 investigators (X.H. and J.W.) were responsible for the intervention compliance management. School teachers or parents or legal guardians were reminded about the intervention to improve treatment compliance every week.</p>            
            <p>Clinical examinations were performed at baseline and at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up visits. Baseline demographic characteristics were collected via questionnaire; the information was obtained from school teachers with permission from the participants and their guardians.</p>            <p>Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were assessed at 4 m by trained optometrists using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) logMAR chart (Guangzhou Xieyi Weishikang). Axial length (AL) was measured before cycloplegia using the IOLMaster (Carl Zeiss Meditec) and averaged until the maximum error did not exceed 0.05 mm. Cycloplegia was induced half-yearly using 2 drops of 1% cyclopentolate (Alcon) 5 minutes apart. One additional drop was administered 5 minutes later if cycloplegia was insufficient. After an additional 30 minutes, full cycloplegia was present if the pupil diameter reached at least 6 mm and the pupillary reaction to light was absent. Refraction data were measured using an autorefractor (KR8800; Topcon) 3 times after cycloplegia and averaged until the desired precision (0.25 D) was achieved. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans and fundus images were obtained from swept-source OCT (DRI OCT Triton; Topcon) under radiographic scanning (radial 9 mm). Choroidal thickness was obtained automatically from the built-in segmentation software.</p>            
            <p>The primary outcome was the 12-month cumulative incidence of myopia in both groups. Myopia was defined as the cycloplegic SER (sphere plus half of cylinder) of −0.50 D or less in the more myopic eye. Secondary outcomes of the study were the changes in SER, AL, choroidal thickness, UCVA, and BCVA over 1 year. Data from the more myopic eye at baseline were also used for secondary outcomes analysis.</p>            
            <p>At baseline, all children in the intervention group completed 1 session of the RLRL intervention. The children were asked to close their eyes until the bright spot, also known as the <i>afterimage</i>, disappeared, then the duration of the afterimage was documented. If the afterimage duration exceeded 6 minutes, the child was clinically considered too sensitive to the intervention and was excluded (n = 2). In addition, eye discomforts, including but not limited to pain, itching, dryness, dazzling, short-term glare, and flash blindness, were reported to investigators or supervisors. The treatment was stopped immediately if the child in the intervention group had any severe adverse events, including sudden visual loss of 2 or more lines or a scotoma perceived in the center of the viewing field by the child.</p>            <p>Fundus images by swept-source OCT were independently evaluated by 2 accredited senior ophthalmologists. Any fundus abnormality and its grading, including but not limited to vitreomacular traction, macular schisis, macular hole, intraretinal fluid, subretinal fluid, hemorrhage, retinal pigment epithelium proliferation, and atrophy, would be recorded. Any difference between the 2 graders was adjudicated by a third senior ophthalmologist (X.X.).</p>            
            <p>The sample size estimation was conducted based on the assumption of a 2-sided α level of .05, 90% power, and the expected effect size. The incidence of myopia among primary school students with premyopia was approximately 42% per year,<sup><a href="#zoi230304r46" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-references">46</a></sup><sup>,<a href="#zoi230304r48" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-references">48</a></sup><sup>,<a href="#zoi230304r49" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-references">49</a></sup> and the expected reduction was set at 50%. This would require a total of 202 participants. Adjusting for 20% loss to follow-up yielded a total sample size of 254 participants.</p>            
            <p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Outcomes were analyzed by means of an intention-to-treat method and a per-protocol method. The intention-to-treat analysis included participants in both groups at baseline, while the per-protocol analysis included participants in the control group and those in the intervention group who were able to continue the intervention without interruption by the COVID-19 pandemic. A comparison between the 2 groups was performed using the χ<sup>2</sup> test. The unpaired <i>t</i> test was used to compare continuous outcomes with normal distribution, while the nonparametric statistical method was used if otherwise. All <i>P</i> values were from 2-sided tests and results were deemed statistically significant at <i>P</i> &lt; .05.</p>            
            <p>A total of 278 children (28.1%) were included in the trial: 139 children (mean [SD] age, 8.3 [1.1] years; 71 boys [51.1%]) in the intervention group and 139 children (mean [SD] age, 8.3 [1.1] years; 68 boys [48.9%]) in the control group (<a href="#zoi230304f1" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-figure-table">Figure 1</a>; eTable 1 in <a data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-supplemental" href="#note-ZOI230304-1">Supplement 2</a>). <a href="#zoi230304f1" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-figure-table">Figure 1</a> summarizes the number of the participants who completed enrollment, baseline examination, and intervention at each visit.

A total of 65 of 139 children (46.8%) in the intervention group and 73 of 139 children (52.5%) in the control group did not attend the 9-month follow-up visit. For the last 3 months of the study, 32 of 139 children (23.0%) in the intervention group were able to continue the RLRL treatment. Despite this, we continued the trial and tried our best to complete the examination at the 12-month visit.

            <p>The efficacy of a 33.4% to 54.1% relative reduction in the incidence of myopia with the RLRL intervention should be interpreted carefully.

As demonstrated in our subgroup analysis, for the children with premyopia, in particular those whose SER was very close to −0.50 D (the cutoff for myopia), the prophylactic effect was much lower because the intervention was introduced too late.

The effect of RLRL therapy might originate from increasing blood flow and metabolism of the fundus, as well as ameliorating scleral hypoxia, which had been proved to be a promoter for myopia development.<sup><a href="#zoi230304r52" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-references">52</a></sup><sup>,<a href="#zoi230304r53" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-references">53</a></sup></p>            <div>

                            </p>
                        </div>
            <p>Our results showed that the effect of the RLRL intervention on myopia prevention was different among baseline SER groups. The RLRL intervention was more effective among children with an SER of 0.01 to 0.50 D at baseline than those with an SER of −0.50 to 0.00 D at baseline. In 2021, the International Myopia Institute defined premyopia as a refractive state of an eye of +0.75 D or less and more than −0.50 D in children.<sup><a href="#zoi230304r42" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-references">42</a></sup> Based on our data, it might already be too late to treat those with an SER of −0.50 to 0.00 D because their incidence of myopia in 12 months could be as high as 83.1%.<sup><a href="#zoi230304r42" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-references">42</a></sup> Therefore, prophylactic intervention, including RLRL therapy and increased outdoor time, may need to be implemented earlier, at least among those with an SER in the range of 0.01 to 0.50 D, or even earlier.</p>            
            <p>After this 12-month RLRL intervention, no functional damage as indicated by BCVA was observed. No children reported having glare, flash blindness, or afterimages longer than 6 minutes after treatment. An afterimage induced by prior adaptation to a visual stimulus is believed to be due to bleaching of photochemical pigments or neural adaptation in the retina. Participants with an afterimage duration exceeding 6 minutes were clinically considered too sensitive to visual stimulus.<sup><a href="#zoi230304r54" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-references">54</a></sup> No other structural changes were noted in this study, consistent with other RLRL studies.<sup><a href="#zoi230304r36" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-references">36</a></sup><sup>,<a href="#zoi230304r40" data-tab-toggle=".tab-nav-references">40</a></sup></p>            
            <p>This study had several limitations. First, the open-label design may bias the results. Future studies comparing a light treatment simulator with a much lower power should exclude potential placebo effects. Second, because of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai, approximately 70% of the children in the intervention group discontinued treatment from 9 to 12 months. Nevertheless, we tried to maximize the follow-up retention rate for the 12-month visit. Furthermore, children who continued treatment and those who discontinued treatment were well balanced for baseline characteristics. Third, the observed efficacy of the intervention in preventing myopia was generalizable only to the device used in the present study. It is unproven that other wavelengths, power intensities, or frequencies of intervention may have a similar or even better efficacy.</p>            
            <p>This randomized clinical trial found that RLRL is a novel and effective intervention for myopia prevention, with good user acceptability and a 54.1% reduction in incident myopia within 12 months for children with premyopia. Our findings have public health significance, especially for myopia prevention in countries with a high incidence of myopia. More studies are needed to understand the long-term efficacy and safety, optimal intervention dose, and potential underlying mechanisms of the RLRL intervention.</p>
