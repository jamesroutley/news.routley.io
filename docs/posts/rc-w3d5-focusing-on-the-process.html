    <h1>RC W3D5 - Focusing on the process</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_1949435">
    
      <div><p>I enjoy writing Friday posts since it lets me recap the week, plus having the weekend to mull things over.</p><p>In <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/rc-w1d3-building-patience">Week 1</a> of RC, I felt a little down thinking how next year it’ll be 10 years since my first pull request. Over the weekend I spent a bit of time looking through Eli Bendersky’s <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/">blog</a>. I believe I first came across his blog when going through SICP, and later discovered he also had posts on implementing Raft.</p><p>What I hadn’t realized was that he started in blogging in 2003! This got me looking up Patrick McKenzie’s <a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com">blog</a> (aka patio11), who started his blog in 2006. OK so if people I admire for their technical writing started way back, then maybe I’m on the right track.</p><p>In any case, it’s a reminder to focus on the process, not the outcome.</p><p>Reading through blog posts also made me think about how blogs are the more fun read because you feel you’re learning a lot. What’s probably happening is you’re trading off depth for breadth. Perhaps this is why I have a tendency to go deep when there’s an external source of discipline, like a boss or course instructor.</p><p>Maybe it’s time to build that volitional muscle to go deep.</p><p>Going back to Eli, he didn’t just do SICP for a week. He spent <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2008/04/18/sicp-conclusion" title="Link: https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2008/04/18/sicp-conclusion">close to a year</a> working through the whole book, completing 94% of the 356 exercises. He also wrote ~66k words across 52 blog posts. That’s real volitional muscle.</p><p>It&#39;s a great blog - I looked it up over the weekend to read up on <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/haskell-functions-as-functors-applicatives-and-monads/" title="Link: https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/haskell-functions-as-functors-applicatives-and-monads/">functors</a> in Haskell. I then found a <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2018/type-inference/">post</a> on Hindley-Milner. I also discovered a <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/right-and-left-folds-primitive-recursion-patterns-in-python-and-haskell/">post</a> discussing left vs right folds, which goes into it in quite a bit more detail than mine…</p><p>Process. Not outcome.</p><p>It’s half way through my RC half batch. My plans for the remaining 3 weeks: chat more, pair more, write more. I would actually like to spend a bit of time going through Andrej Karpathy videos, and play around with AI-assisted coding. Let’s be a bit more ambitious, here we go.</p><p>Week 4 - Idris, CIS 194 Week 10 (functors)</p><p>Week 5 - Prolog, CIS 194 Week 11 (applicative functors)</p><p>Week 6 - parser combinators, CIS 194 Week 12 (monads)</p><p>Building that volitional muscle to go deep will have to wait.</p></div>
