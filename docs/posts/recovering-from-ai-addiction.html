<p>Welcome to Internet and Technology Addicts Anonymous! We’re glad you’ve found us, and we hope our community can be as helpful to you as it has been for us. <strong>ITAA is a Twelve-Step fellowship of individuals who support each other in recovering from internet and technology addiction.</strong> This includes social media addiction, phone addiction, video addiction, television addiction, gaming addiction, news addiction, pornography addiction, dating apps, online research, online shopping, or any other digital activity that becomes compulsive and problematic. </p>











<p>Regardless of how large or small you feel your problem may be, we encourage you to try attending one of our daily meetings to see whether ITAA can be helpful for you. Our meetings are free and open to anyone who struggles with compulsive internet use. Meetings are safe, secure, and anonymous. ITAA is highly diverse, and our meetings include members of all ages, genders, and ethnicities from around the world.

<p>Despite how new AI is as a technology, it’s just as possible to become addicted as to any other digital behavior. Specifically, AI addiction is the compulsive and harmful use of AI-powered applications. It can involve AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT, video or image generation apps, algorithm-driven social media platforms, AI-powered gaming, AI companions, AI roleplaying, AI-generated pornography, or any other generative AI or LLM (large language model) application that becomes compulsive and harmful. As a subset of <a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/internet-addiction/">internet and technology addiction</a>, AI addiction can lead to changes in the brain that over time compromise our ability to focus, prioritize, regulate our mood, and relate to others. </p>



<p>Those of us who have come to identify as AI addicts experienced several common symptoms. We used AI applications for longer than we intended, despite attempts to control or cut back our use. Even when we were aware of the consequences and wanted to stop, we were unable to do so. We increasingly found our sense of validation and emotional regulation was tied to our use of AI models. When we weren’t connected to our AI applications, we experienced distraction, anxiety, and irritability. We were unable to enjoy and be present with our offline lives. We used AI to alter our moods and escape our problems. Our addictive behaviors jeopardized our relationships, educational pursuits, and career opportunities. We felt shame and demoralization about our use of AI.  </p>



<p>When we first noticed these troubling experiences, we began to acknowledge that something wasn’t right. But many of us still questioned whether we really had an addiction, especially given that this is such a new technology. For those of us still wondering, the following questions may help us better identify whether there are signs of an addiction to AI applications in our lives.</p>



<h2><strong>AI</strong><strong> Addiction Questionnaire:</strong></h2>



<ol>
<li>Do I ever use AI applications to quickly check something and then discover that hours have passed?</li>



<li>Do I ever swear off or set limits around my use of AI, and then break my commitments?</li>



<li>Do I have binges on AI applications that last all day or late into the night?</li>



<li>Do I turn to AI whenever I have a free moment?</li>



<li>Does my use of AI lead me to neglect my personal hygiene, nutritional needs, or physical health?</li>



<li>Do I feel isolated, emotionally absent, distracted, or anxious when I’m not using my AI applications?</li>



<li>Does my use of AI contribute to conflict or avoidance in personal relationships?</li>



<li>Have my digital behaviors jeopardized my studies, finances, or career?</li>



<li>Do I hide or lie about the amount of time I spend using AI or the kinds of AI-generated content I consume? </li>



<li>Do I feel guilt or shame around my use of AI?</li>
</ol>



<p>Nobody should have to suffer due to their technology use. If you’ve answered yes to several of the above questions, we encourage you to consider getting support.</p>











<h2><strong>What are the Effects of AI Addiction?</strong></h2>



<p>AI addiction is a subset of internet addiction disorder (IAD), which was first investigated by the psychologist Dr. Kimberly S. Young, who published the original <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-16534-005">diagnostic criteria</a> for this mental health disorder in 1998. Today there is still an open discussion in the scientific community regarding how to define, qualify, and study the various forms of internet addiction disorder, and the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5-TR) has begun to acknowledge the severity of this class of addictions through its inclusion of <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/internet-gaming">internet gaming disorder</a>. There is <a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/the-doctors-opinion/">widespread consensus</a> from both researchers and clinicians that the problematic and compulsive overuse of the internet, digital media, and smart devices has been rising over the past two decades, and that the prevalence of this behavioral addiction is associated with a variety of mental, emotional, physical, interpersonal, and professional problems.</p>



<p>Perhaps most significantly, the dopamine releases triggered by internet and technology addiction have been shown to cause <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00375/full">structural changes in the brain</a> very similar to the changes experienced in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/adb.12338">people with alcohol or drug addictions</a>. These changes lead to impairments in our <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19904-y">decision-making</a>,<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460318302065?via%3Dihub"> reasoning</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01315-7.pdf?proof=t%2529">reward expectation</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01315-7.pdf?proof=t%2529">executive function</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460318302065?via%3Dihub">cognitive function</a>, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00597/full">emotional processing</a>, and our <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0030253">working memory</a>. A variety of studies have shown that access to <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219115">television and video games</a> decreases <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00262/full">the amount of pain medication</a> needed by <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2082989/">hospital patients</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, the effects of internet and technology addiction are not only reflected in the structure of our brains, but in our daily lives as well. Internet and technology addiction is strongly associated with <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00597/full">impulse control disorder</a>, <a href="https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780199928163.001.0001/med-9780199928163-chapter-28">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563222000231">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://www.oxfordclinicalpsych.com/view/10.1093/med-psych/9780199928163.001.0001/med-9780199928163-chapter-28">increased substance use</a>, and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563222000231">depression</a>. In addition to these co-occurring disorders, it’s associated with a higher risk of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32451650/">cardiometabolic disease</a>, <a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.6704">lower sleep quality</a>, <a href="https://jcsm.aasm.org/doi/10.5664/jcsm.6704">increased fatigue</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24619594/">symptoms of insomnia</a>, all of which are <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30175-1/fulltext#seccestitle120">correlated</a> to a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2938855/">higher mortality rate</a>. Perhaps most tragically of all, individuals with internet and technology addiction have much higher rates of suicidal ideation, planning, and attempts—<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29877640/">roughly three times the average</a>.These findings are cause for serious concern. While some might minimize the impact of internet and technology addiction in comparison to chemical substances, the truth is that internet and technology addiction changes our brains in a manner similar to the effects produced by an addiction to alcohol, heroin, or other drugs.</p>



<h2><strong>Who is at risk for <strong>AI</strong> Addiction?</strong></h2>



<p>AI addiction is a condition that can affect people of all ages, from children and teenagers to those later in life. Our meetings include young adults, college students, working professionals, parents, and retirees, with members of all ages, genders, and ethnicities from around the world. While the risk factors are varied, internet addiction does not discriminate based on age, educational level, socio-economic status, geography, race, or ethnicity. Its negative effects impact not only the addict themselves, but also <a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/for-family-and-friends/">their family members and friends</a>. By damaging our potential, self-esteem, and quality of life, excessive use of artificial intelligence can impair our lives. Additionally, by contributing to depression and suicidal tendencies, our addiction can be life-threatening. Regardless of our background, if our use of AI is causing us to experience distress or difficulties, there are actions we can take to improve our situation and find relief.</p>



<h2><strong>A Solution for <strong>AI</strong> Addiction</strong></h2>



<p>While internet and technology addiction has only begun to receive attention in recent years, the disease of addiction is not new. Millions of people have found sustainable, long-term freedom from their addictive behaviors through mutual aid support groups modeled after Alcoholics Anonymous. A recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/upshot/alcoholics-anonymous-new-evidence.html">systematic review</a> conducted by Stanford public health researchers determined that participation in Alcoholics Anonymous was nearly always found to be more effective than other therapies in achieving continuous abstinence from alcoholism. The AA model has been successfully adapted to help people suffering from a variety of addictions, including narcotics, marijuana, nicotine, sex, pornography, and food, among others.In continuation of this tradition, Internet and Technology Addicts Anonymous applies the proven model of AA to help those who are suffering from an addiction to technology find long-term freedom from their self-destructive behaviors. We share our experience, strength, and hope with each other through <a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/online-meetings/">group meetings</a> and <a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/a-guide-to-outreach-calls-in-itaa/">one-on-one relationships</a>, and we work a recovery program based on the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous. Our meetings are free and anonymous, and we welcome anyone who thinks they may benefit from support to visit one of our meetings.</p>



<h2><strong>How to Recover From AI Addiction</strong></h2>



<p>While there is no permanent or quick cure for AI addiction, there are concrete actions we can take to recover from our compulsive behaviors and restore our emotional and mental wellbeing. We have found the following actions to be of significant help in finding long-term, sustainable freedom from our compulsive and problematic use of AI.</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Attend daily meetings</strong>. In addition to a growing number of<a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/local-internet-addiction-meetings/"> face-to-face meetings</a> around the world, ITAA has<a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/phone-online-meetings/"> daily online meetings</a> where our global fellowship meets to share experience, strength and hope with each other. We are encouraged to try attending six meetings in a short time frame to help decide whether ITAA may be helpful to us.</li>



<li><strong>Make daily outreach calls. </strong>Our impulsive buying dependence drew us into isolation and self-reliance. As we begin to recover, we learn that we can trust others and be vulnerable.<a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/a-guide-to-outreach-calls-in-itaa/"> Calling other members</a> outside of meetings helps us stay connected, supported, and sober, and it gives us an opportunity to share in greater detail than we might during a meeting.</li>



<li><strong>Abstain</strong>. With the help of other members in recovery, we<a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/discovering-sobriety-worksheet-an-introduction-to-internet-addiction-recovery/"> identify and abstain</a> from the specific addictive behaviors which are causing the greatest difficulties in our lives. We recognize that this is a process that unfolds over time, and we make use of the support available to us in ITAA to remain sober one day at a time.</li>



<li><strong>Learn more about the recovery process</strong>. Our website has many<a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/resources/"> resources</a> about the nature of our addiction and how we might best<a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/discovering-sobriety-worksheet-an-introduction-to-internet-addiction-recovery/"> chart our recovery journey</a>,<a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/a-guide-to-withdrawals/"> navigate withdrawal symptoms</a>, and<a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/resources/tools-of-recovery/"> respond to cravings</a>. In addition, there’s a rich body of literature from other 12 Step programs that we can lean on to better inform our healing process and to learn more about the time-tested methods which have helped millions of other addicts recover.</li>



<li><strong>Find a sponsor and work the steps. </strong>We have benefitted from asking somebody we resonate with to informally mentor us as a <a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/sponsorship/">sponsor</a> and working<a href="https://internetaddictsanonymous.org/12-steps-of-itaa/"> the Twelve Steps</a> together with them, which is the vital and transformative basis of our long-term recovery from our addiction. A great way to connect with potential sponsors is to make outreach calls with other members who are sober and working the Steps.</li>



<li><strong>Make use of outside help.</strong> Many members supplement their recovery with a variety of resources beyond ITAA, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychotherapy, group therapy, psychiatry, inpatient or outpatient addiction treatment centers, other 12 Step fellowships, spiritual counsel, or other mental health wellness resources. While we do not endorse any one treatment option or intervention in particular, we encourage all members to avail themselves of any outside help that can support them in their recovery journey. A healthcare or mental health professional may be able to give advice tailored to your situation.</li>
</ol>



<h2><strong>What Does Sobriety From <strong>AI</strong> Addiction Look Like?</strong></h2>



<p>Sobriety in ITAA is a process of discovery that looks different for each of us. As part of this process, we identify and abstain from the specific behaviors which trigger our addiction. We have also found it beneficial to establish a positive vision for our internet and technology use. For example, we may practice using technology purposefully, minimally, or only as necessary. Some of us have found it to completely abstain from AI chatbots and AI tools, while others of us learn how to engage with AI systems only as needed for our work. We treat AI technology with caution and placed greater emphasis on our human interactions, attending ITAA meetings to help use heal from our addiction.</p>



<p>We respect each member’s dignity to discover their own path to recovery, and we work with other experienced members to help define what sobriety means for each of us as individuals. As part of this process, we lean on meetings and phone calls to help maintain our sobriety commitments. Rather than using AI for distraction or to numb our emotions, we seek to use technology as a tool for meeting our goals, living in alignment with our values, and developing flourishing lives.</p>



<h2><strong>Types of Internet Addiction</strong></h2>



<p>While we all suffer from a common disease, it expresses itself in different ways for each of us. The following are some common compulsive internet and technology behaviors.
