    <h1>Linux Text Manipulation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <p>Today, I wanted to make a module for my AwesomeWM status bar that shows the currently playing Spotify song, it’d be nice if it could show something human-readable like this: <em>Wild World by Yusuf/Cat Stevens</em>.</p>
<p>Through a quick search, I found a tiny bash script, <a href="https://gist.github.com/streetturtle/fa6258f3ff7b17747ee3">sp</a>, that does what I need. except the output must be cleaned up.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-title="sp current&#39;s output"><code><span><span>joe</span><span>@popos</span><span>&gt;</span><span> sp current</span></span>
<span><span>Album</span><span>        Tea For The Tillerman (</span><span>Remastered</span><span> 2020)</span></span>
<span><span>AlbumArtist</span><span>  Yusuf / Cat Stevens</span></span>
<span><span>Artist</span><span>       Yusuf / Cat Stevens</span></span>
<span><span>Title</span><span>        Wild World</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>I could ask chatgpt to format this or write a Lua script, but that wouldn’t be much fun, <em>would it?</em> in this article, we’ll learn how to use <code tabindex="0"><span><span>awk</span></span></code>, <code tabindex="0"><span><span>sed</span></span></code> and other commands to get the desired output.


</p><div> <p> Intended Audience </p> <p>  this is intended for people who have used Linux but are otherwise new to the terminal, if you’ve at least created a file from the command line, you’re good to go, I’ll cover everything else throughout the article </p> </div>
<p>If you want to follow along, download the bash script, and experiment with the commands we’ll learn, but that’s not required per se.</p>
<h3 id="mini-problem-1">Mini Problem #1</h3>
<p>To get started <code tabindex="0"><span><span>sp</span><span> current</span></span></code> returns the album name, album artist, song artist, and song title, whereas we only need the artist and title. we can use <code tabindex="0"><span><span>sed</span></span></code> to pick the specific lines we need.</p>
<p>sed works by looping through lines of the input and doing a given action, by default it prints the resulting lines to <abbr title="standard output">stdout</abbr>. we can give sed a file to work with but more commonly you’ll pipe a command into sed, as we’ll do later on.</p>
<blockquote>
<details><summary>What do you mean by <strong><em>pipe</em></strong>? </summary>Generally, in Linux, a command’s input is read from the keyboard and its output (along with any errors) is printed on your screen. we can, however, change this behavior. </details>
</blockquote>
<p>let’s look into sed in more detail</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> sed</span><span> &#39;&#39;</span><span> # no action given, sed will print the lines as is</span></span>
<span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> sed</span><span> &#39;</span><span>s/Cat/Dog/g</span><span>&#39;</span><span> # replace Cat with Dog and print every line</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># the n flag suppresses the automatic printing</span></span>
<span><span># this will replace Cat with Dog but print nothing!</span></span>
<span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> sed</span><span> </span><span>-n</span><span> &#39;</span><span>s/Cat/Dog/g</span><span>&#39;</span><span> </span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># p prints a line</span></span>
<span><span># so this will print each line twice (default + p action)</span></span>
<span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> sed</span><span> </span><span><span>&#39;</span><span>p</span><span>&#39;</span></span></span>
<span><span>  </span></span>
<span><span># if we combine -n with the p action we can do this</span></span>
<span><span># this is equivalent to plain sed &#39;&#39;</span></span>
<span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> sed</span><span> -n</span><span> </span><span><span>&#39;</span><span>p</span><span>&#39;</span></span></span>
<span><span>  </span></span>
<span><span># we can print a specific line too (we&#39;ll need this later!)</span></span>
<span><span># this will print every line AND print the second line an extra time</span></span>
<span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> sed</span><span> &#39;</span><span>2p</span><span>&#39;</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># finally, we can chain actions.</span></span>
<span><span># this substitutes Cat with Dog and prints ONLY the 2nd line, because of the n flag.</span></span>
<span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> sed</span><span> -n</span><span> &#39;</span><span>s/Cat/Dog/g;2p</span><span>&#39;</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>and now—as you may have already figured out—we can print the artist and song name only like so:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> sed</span><span> -n</span><span> &#39;</span><span>3p;4p</span><span>&#39;</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>and we end up with</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Artist       Yusuf/Cat Stevens</span></span>
<span><span>Title        Wild World</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<h3 id="mini-problem-2">Mini Problem #2</h3>
<p>Next, we need to get rid of the column labels, we can use <code tabindex="0"><span><span>cut</span></span></code> for this. As with <code tabindex="0"><span><span>sed</span></span></code>, <code tabindex="0"><span><span>cut</span></span></code> accepts a file as its input, if no file is given it’ll read from <abbr title="standard input">stdin</abbr>.</p>
<p>Here is how we usually work with <code tabindex="0"><span><span>cut</span></span></code>, you give it a delimiter and a set of columns to print, and it will split each line by that delimiter and return the selected columns.</p>
<p>in our case, columns are separated with a space, so we can do the following</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># we&#39;re splitting the input by spaces and picking the 2nd column</span></span>
<span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> cut</span><span> </span><span><span>-d</span><span> &#39;</span><span> &#39;</span></span><span> </span><span>-f2</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>our columns are seperated by multiple spaces though, so cut will treat the empty-ness between each space as its own column, to avoid this we can inject the command <code tabindex="0"><span><span>tr</span></span></code> to trim the extra spaces:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># the s flag specifies what to trim</span></span>
<span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> </span><span><span>tr</span><span> -s</span><span> &#39;</span><span> &#39;</span></span><span> |</span><span> cut</span><span> -d</span><span> &#39;</span><span> &#39;</span><span> -f2</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>But this is still not totally right. if a song’s title contains more than one word we’ll get this</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Artist       Yusuf/Cat Stevens</span></span>
<span><span>Title        Wild World</span></span>
<span><span> </span></span>
<span><span>Yusuf/Cat</span></span>
<span><span>Wild</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p>you can pass <code tabindex="0"><span><span>cut</span></span></code> a column range to print, as in <code tabindex="0"><span><span>cut</span><span> -d</span><span> &#39;</span><span> &#39;</span><span> -f2-4</span></span></code> to select the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th columns, <strong>if the range is open-ended</strong>, <code tabindex="0"><span><span>cut</span></span></code> <strong>will print every column until the end of the line</strong>, so let’s incorporate that into our script.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> tr</span><span> -s</span><span> &#39;</span><span> &#39;</span><span> |</span><span> cut</span><span> -d</span><span> &#39;</span><span> &#39;</span><span> </span><span>-f2-</span><span> |</span><span> sed</span><span> -n</span><span> &#39;</span><span>3p;4p</span><span>&#39;</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>output:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Yusuf/Cat Stevens</span></span>
<span><span>Wild World</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<p><strong>note</strong>: as I’ve shown you <code tabindex="0"><span><span>tr</span></span></code> needs to be applied before <code tabindex="0"><span><span>cut</span></span></code> on the contrary, <code tabindex="0"><span><span>cut</span></span></code> and <code tabindex="0"><span><span>sed</span></span></code> can be swapped because they serve entirely different purposes.</p>
<h3 id="mini-problem-3">Mini Problem #3</h3>
<p>Now, what’s left is to simply join the lines and format them nicely. we can use <code tabindex="0"><span><span>awk</span></span></code> to do this.</p>
<p><code tabindex="0"><span><span>awk</span></span></code> is based on a condition-script model, It’s similar to <code tabindex="0"><span><span>sed</span></span></code> it checks if the current line matches the condition and executes the appropriate script, although I find <code tabindex="0"><span><span>awk</span></span></code> to have a more expressive syntax.</p>
<p>awk scripts are written in quotes like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> awk</span><span> &#39;</span><span>{print $1}</span><span>&#39;</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>let’s look at a few examples. any of these can be passed to awk in quotes.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>{</span><span>print</span><span>} </span><span># no condition given, prints every line.</span></span>
<span><span>  </span></span>
<span><span># NR==1 matches the 1st line only</span></span>
<span><span># thus, this will print the 1st line</span></span>
<span><span>NR</span><span>==</span><span>1</span><span>{</span><span>print</span><span>} </span></span>
<span><span>  </span></span>
<span><span># any subsequent script isn&#39;t part of the condition. </span></span>
<span><span># despite them being on the same line.</span></span>
<span><span># this will print the print every line + the first line again</span></span>
<span><span>NR</span><span>==</span><span>1</span><span>{</span><span>print</span><span>}{</span><span>print</span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span># awk has pre-defined globals corresponding to columns in your input</span></span>
<span><span># this behaves like sed and will print the first column.</span></span>
<span><span>{</span><span>print</span><span> $1</span><span>}</span></span>
<span><span> </span></span>
<span><span># $0 matches the entire line</span></span>
<span><span># this is equivalent to {print}</span></span>
<span><span>{</span><span>print</span><span> $0</span><span>}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Lastly, you can assign globals to variables,</p>
<p>this assigns a to the 1st column of the 1st line and then prints <code tabindex="0"><span><span>x</span></span></code> for every line in the input.
note that the first script only runs once, thus a will stay the same for every line</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>NR</span><span>==</span><span>1</span><span>{x</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span><span>}{</span><span>print</span><span> x}</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>now we can combine everything we know to get this script:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> ...</span><span> |</span><span> awk</span><span> &#39;</span><span>NR==1{a=$0; next}{print $0 &#34; by &#34; a}</span><span>&#39;</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>this does the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>we assign <code tabindex="0"><span><span>a</span></span></code> to the artist name (entire first line)</li>
<li><code tabindex="0"><span><span>skip</span></span></code> tells <code tabindex="0"><span><span>awk</span></span></code> to <em>skip</em> the execution of the second script and to move to the next line</li>
<li>we’re on the second line now so <code tabindex="0"><span><span>NR</span><span>==</span><span>1</span></span></code> isn’t matched and the first script is skipped.</li>
<li>print the song name (<code tabindex="0"><span><span>$0</span></span></code>) then the string literal <code tabindex="0"><span><span>by</span></span></code> then the artist name (content of variable <code tabindex="0"><span><span>a</span></span></code>)</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>Yusuf/Cat Stevens</span></span>
<span><span>Wild World</span></span>
<span><span> </span></span>
<span><span>Wild World by Yusuf/Cat Stevens</span></span>
<span><span></span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>That concludes our script, here is what we ended up with:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>sp</span><span> current</span><span> |</span><span> tr</span><span> -s</span><span> &#39;</span><span> &#39;</span><span> |</span><span> cut</span><span> -d</span><span> &#39;</span><span> &#39;</span><span> -f2-</span><span> |</span><span> sed</span><span> -n</span><span> &#39;</span><span>3p;4p</span><span>&#39;</span><span> |</span><span> awk</span><span> &#39;</span><span>NR==1{a=$0; next}{print $0 &#34; by &#34; a}</span><span>&#39;</span></span>
<span></span></code></pre>
<p>Now this script could be optimized in different ways, but instead of showing you how to do it here, I leave that as <em>an exercise to the reader</em>. here are a couple of things you can do, ranging from easiest to hardest:</p>
<ul>
<li>replace the <code tabindex="0"><span><span>cut</span></span></code> command with an additional <code tabindex="0"><span><span>sed</span></span></code> action</li>
<li>re-write the entire thing from memory</li>
<li>make the script as short as possible</li>
<li>write the entire script in <code tabindex="0"><span><span>awk</span></span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I hope you learned something new today and if you attempt any of these, please share what you did either in the mastodon replies or through an article on your blog. I promise to take a look and I’ll probably learn something myself!</p>  <a href="https://brid.gy/publish/mastodon"></a> </article></div>
