                    <p>The heads up display, or HUD, has the most important camera controls such as lens selection, frame rate, shutter angle, timecode, ISO, white balance, tint, histogram and audio levels. You can adjust settings such as exposure by touching the ISO indicator, or you can change the audio levels simply by touching the audio meters. It&#39;s that easy! Everything is interactive, so if you tap any item you can instantaneously change its settings without having to search through complex menus! You can clear the heads up display to reveal the full screen image by swiping up or down with your finger.</p>

                <p>Creating your Blackmagic ID allows you to have access to Blackmagic Cloud. It’s easy and there’s no charge! Simply tap on Blackmagic Cloud in the media tab to go to the Blackmagic Cloud website to register. Or go to the cloud icon on the Blackmagic Design website. Once you have created your Blackmagic ID you can log in and set up your project library. This is where you create projects to upload to Cloud Storage. With your project library set up, you can then select for Blackmagic Camera to sync directly to Cloud Storage from the app. Invite others using their Blackmagic ID to share the project and instantly collaborate with editors and colorists globally, working on the same project!</p>

                </p>
                <p>When shooting with Blackmagic Camera, the video you capture can be instantly uploaded as a proxy file, followed by the camera originals, and saved to Blackmagic Cloud Storage. These will then automatically sync to all members of the project anywhere in the world. This means you can start editing quickly using your proxies, speeding up your workflow. Media can be constantly added to the project by multiple cameras in different locations which is automatically synced to other project members via Blackmagic Cloud. Everyone can use the proxy media and the colorist or finisher can download the original high res camera originals and render. It’s a fast, seamless and automatic way to collaborate.</p>

                </p>
                <p>The sync bin is the world’s fastest and most innovative way to select the perfect cutaway when doing multi camera shoots. Using the time of day timecode, sync the clips shot on multiple  phones at the same time. Just select the sync bin icon and DaVinci will find all clips that sync to the timeline and display them in a multiview. Simply scroll up and down the timeline and you will see all the clips that sync to the point in the timeline so you can pick the best cutaway. Then click the view with the mouse and then adjust the in and out points to select the cutaway you want. Now use the source overwrite edit mode to add this selected clip to the timeline, perfectly synced to the clip below!</p>
