<p><strong>Context</strong>: I arrived in Brooklyn last week to start a 12 week program at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" target="_blank">Recurse Center</a> (RC). Read more about how it works <a href="https://www.recurse.com/faq" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everything is new; my routines, environment, habits, diet, etc. But for all the stress and uncertainty leading up to this, I can finally say it worked out beautifully. I&#39;m subletting a cozy room with a kind &amp; considerate roommate near Prospect Park, and actually enjoy my 25 min commute via subway each day.</p>
<p>I&#39;m happy here.</p>

<p>At the Recurse Center, days flew by in a frenzied blur of activity as we oriented ourselves to a new lifestyle. Below is a summary of how the first week progressed.</p>
<h2 id="day-1-virtual-welcome">üåê Day 1 - Virtual Welcome</h2><p>Fun fact: I&#39;m part of the largest ever batch at 52 people! Since half are attending remotely, the first day was spent on Zoom doing onboarding, <a href="https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules" target="_blank">learning the social rules</a>, 1:1 introductions via breakout rooms, and learning how to use <a href="https://zulip.com/" target="_blank">Zulip</a> for connecting with the wider community.</p>
<h2 id="day-2-keys-to-the-kingdom">üîë Day 2 - Keys to the Kingdom</h2><p>The first real day at the Hub in Downtown Brooklyn. The building has two floors dedicated to Recursers; one is the general social area with a kitchen, presentation space, art &amp; music room, and more. The other is a quiet working area with a library; my favorite place to be. We were given a tour of the space in groups while munching on bagels &amp; cream cheese. The rest of the day was spent in a flurry of conversations with others about their interests, ambitions, and background. There&#39;s <em>so</em> many brilliant and kind people here, I&#39;m so grateful to share space &amp; time with them.</p>
<h2 id="day-3-blog-day">‚úçÔ∏è Day 3 - Blog Day</h2><p>I&#39;ve decided to make &#34;Writing Wednesdays&#34; a thing, so I added a <a href="https://vincentrolfs.dev/now">Now</a> page that describes what I&#39;m currently focusing on, updated my <a href="https://vincentrolfs.dev/newsletter">newsletter</a> backend to EmailOctopus, and got a draft post written about the time I got jealous of a tire and started eating a lot of butter (stay tuned for that one).</p>
<h2 id="day-4-job-market-facts">üíº Day 4 - Job Market Facts</h2><p>I met with staff at RC&#39;s <a href="https://www.recurse.com/career-services" target="_blank">Career Services</a> to talk about the job market and get a better idea of what lies ahead. I learned a number of very important things this day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote jobs are declining; most of the open positions are for in-person work in cities like LA/NY/Boston.</li>
<li>Technical difficulty in interviewing is at an all-time high, competition is fierce and the bar has been raised considerably.</li>
<li>Typescript is <em>so</em> hot right now.</li>
<li>AI-assisted development experience is expected, Cursor/Claude Code being strongly preferred for most roles.</li>
</ul>
<p>This week I&#39;ll be attending a Freelancers &amp; Contractors meeting with other entrepreneurs to see what that side of the economy looks like. I still have no idea what 2026 holds in store, but finding these facts early will help.</p>
<h2 id="day-5-saying-no">üôÖ Day 5 - Saying No</h2><p>On Friday, we gathered for a Volition class; volition being the power of using one&#39;s will to follow through on projects &amp; ideas. We made a list of everything we <em>wanted</em> to work on, sorted them by various criteria, and were encouraged to make cuts. I slashed my list of projects in half for the sake of focus. It&#39;s hard to realize that your time and energy is limited, especially at a magical place like RC.</p>
<p>I am however very excited for the projects that remain and can&#39;t wait to share them with you.</p>
<h2 id="keep-in-touch">üíå Keep In Touch</h2><p>I don&#39;t plan on doing weekly summaries, but writing is a first-class focus during my time here. If you&#39;d like to stay in the loop, you can checkout my <a href="https://vincentrolfs.dev/now">Now</a> page to see what I‚Äôm up to recently, and you can always sign up for the Friends of Flavius‚Ñ¢ Newsletter below for doodles, photos of Roci, and things I find fascinating.</p>
