    <h1>Ask HN: I&#39;m looking for a good book on the fundamentals of CS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I&#39;m at the beginning of my software dev career, and as I didn&#39;t go to school for anything related (B.Sc. Chemistry), I feel like I really would like to have the fundamentals of CS down. Doubly so as I would like to go into the field of VR, and right now I&#39;m working on my own toy rendering engine, which I feel is really exposing my lack of knowledge...<p>Anyways, any suggestions welcome. Ideally it&#39;d be more digestible than just a plain textbook but I&#39;m open to anything. I imagine either way it&#39;ll be a tough but great read to work through :)</p></td></div></div>
