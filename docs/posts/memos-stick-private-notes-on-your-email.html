    <h1>Memos: stick private notes on your email</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pagefind-body=""> <p>Today we’re launching a new feature at Fastmail: memos.</p> <p>Add a memo to an email to jot down private notes — remind yourself of tasks, record when you paid a bill, capture notes from a side conversation, or anything else!</p> <p>Your memo will stay stuck to the top of the email, so you won’t forget. Want to change it? Just click and type, it saves automatically. It’s super simple, but surprisingly powerful.</p> <p>Memos are private, only visible to you. They are not sent to anyone else in the conversation.</p> <p>When you add a memo it will show up in the message list as well, so you can see at a glance the memos you’ve added to conversations in a label or folder. Here’s a quick look at it in action:</p>  <p>We’ve integrated memos deeply into our search as well. Text in your memos will be matched against words you search for, just like with your messages. You can search for text specifically inside memos with the operator <code>memo:&lt;text&gt;</code>. Or, want to just find all the messages with a memo? Search for <code>has:memo</code>.</p> <p>If you also use another email app to access your Fastmail account, such as Apple Mail or Thunderbird, you’ll still have access to your memos. You’ll find them in the Memos folder, as a reply to the message your memo is attached to.</p> <p>Memos are available in Fastmail now. Please note, if you have turned conversation grouping off, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.fastmail.help/hc/en-us/articles/1500001969861-Conversations#turnoff">turn it back on</a> to use memos. In multi-user accounts, memos cannot be added to messages that are shared with you by another user; you can only add them to your own messages.</p> <p>Not a Fastmail user yet? <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/features/">Discover all our powerful features</a> to make you more productive, or <a href="https://app.fastmail.com/signup/">start your 30-day free trial today</a>.</p> </div></div>
