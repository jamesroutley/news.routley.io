    <h1>Gmail and Yahoo’s 2024 inbox protections and what they mean for email programs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an ongoing effort to secure inboxes, both Gmail and Yahoo have said that they will be enforcing new protection standards for bulk email senders.</p><p>Gmail, who had already announced a cleanup of inactive accounts in May 2023, <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained in a statement</a> that <b>enforcement will begin in February 2024</b>, and they’ll be carefully monitoring senders transmitting more than 5000 messages a day. In a very similar announcement, <a href="https://blog.postmaster.yahooinc.com/post/730172167494483968/more-secure-less-spam" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo explained</a> that they’ll also be targeting the first quarter of 2024.</p><div><div><svg width="280px" height="184px" viewBox="0 -30 280 215" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g id="Homepage-2020" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="Homepage-Desktop-01" transform="translate(-864.000000, -1808.000000)" fill="#FFFFFF"><g id="Quote-Red" transform="translate(0.000000, 1772.000000)"><path d="M1077,12 C1103.99512,12 1144,22.4392548 1144,93.5 C1144,164.560745 1086.96748,220 1028,220 L1028,172 L1028,172 C1059.89781,172 1087.5,142.097776 1087.5,120 C1058.4043,128.935547 1016,116.44552 1016,69.5 C1016,22.5544799 1050.00488,12 1077,12 Z M925,12 C951.995117,12 992,22.4392548 992,93.5 C992,164.560745 934.967484,220 876,220 L876,172 L876,172 C907.897807,172 935.5,142.097776 935.5,120 C906.404297,128.935547 864,116.44552 864,69.5 C864,22.5544799 898.004883,12 925,12 Z" id="Combined-Shape"></path></g></g></g></svg><p>Neil Kumaran, Group Product Manager, Gmail Security &amp; Trust</p></div></div><p>These upcoming standards are probably the most substantial we’ve seen a mailbox provider implement in recent years, but they’re not new. In fact, authentication, easy opt-out, and spam monitoring have been high on the list of <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/blog/email/understanding-email-deliverability/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">email deliverability best practices</a> for quite some time now.</p><p>And while it’s no surprise it has caused some concern among senders, at Sinch Mailgun we suspect requirements like these will soon spread across the industry.</p><p>The most straight forward answer to this question is that, if you haven’t already, you’ll need to get serious about certain email deliverability best practices.</p><p>Both Gmail and Yahoo have highlighted three key changes that senders will need to prioritize if they want to be seen as legitimate senders come 2024:</p><ol><li><p><b>Authenticate their email: </b>Senders will be required to verify their sender identities with standard protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.</p></li><li><p><b>Enable easy unsubscription: </b>Senders will need to implement a single-click unsubscribe link within emails if they haven’t already, to allow recipients to easily opt out.</p></li><li><p><b>Only send emails users want: </b>Gmail and Yahoo are getting serious about spam monitoring and senders will need to ensure they’re keeping below a set spam rate threshold.</p></li></ol><p>These mandates will only affect bulk senders, defined by Google as senders with volumes of 5000 or more messages to Gmail addresses in one day. The announcements don’t specify that a sender must send 5000 messages <i>each</i> day, or within a certain time frame, though. So, <b>it’s important to consider your peak holiday sending habits, and large campaigns when checking if these rules will apply to you. </b><i>You</i> may not think of yourself as a bulk sender, but mailbox providers might disagree.</p><p>As we mentioned before, these requirements are not unexpected or revolutionary changes in the way we should be sending emails, but they’re still not followed by many senders. For example, email authentication has been strongly encouraged for a number of years now. Still, our <a href="https://www.mailgun.com/resources/research/state-of-deliverability-2023/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">State of email deliverability report</a> found that around 40% of senders are either unsure or not implementing both SPF and DKIM, and among those using DMARC, 40% are not sure what their policy is.</p><div><div><svg width="280px" height="184px" viewBox="0 -30 280 215" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g id="Homepage-2020" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="Homepage-Desktop-01" transform="translate(-864.000000, -1808.000000)" fill="#FFFFFF"><g id="Quote-Red" transform="translate(0.000000, 1772.000000)"><path d="M1077,12 C1103.99512,12 1144,22.4392548 1144,93.5 C1144,164.560745 1086.96748,220 1028,220 L1028,172 L1028,172 C1059.89781,172 1087.5,142.097776 1087.5,120 C1058.4043,128.935547 1016,116.44552 1016,69.5 C1016,22.5544799 1050.00488,12 1077,12 Z M925,12 C951.995117,12 992,22.4392548 992,93.5 C992,164.560745 934.967484,220 876,220 L876,172 L876,172 C907.897807,172 935.5,142.097776 935.5,120 C906.404297,128.935547 864,116.44552 864,69.5 C864,22.5544799 898.004883,12 925,12 Z" id="Combined-Shape"></path></g></g></g></svg><p>Neil Kumaran Group Product Manager, Gmail Security &amp; Trust</p></div></div><p>The good news is that both providers have highlighted similar updates in their statements, primarily focused on maintaining higher standards of authentication, simplifying unsubscription from commercial emails, and holding senders under a lower spam rate threshold. Here’s a snapshot of what to expect.</p><div><picture id="f6ad4cca-8148-5ac7-967e-d8c031377d57" contentful_id="4Ft87oPVWBXDqOtqxdC0c" name="Mailgun Gmail Inbox Updates 2024 Image" alternative="Image outlining Gmail inbox update for Feburary 2024 that include authentication expectations, single click unsubscribe, and maintaining a low spam rate." internal="[object Object]" __typename="ContentfulImage" picture="[object Object]" sys="[object Object]"><source srcset="https://images.ctfassets.net/y6oq7udscnj8/10DCm9h2Krzx5VIDcJEHWd/d5439ad30bea24d0951769c6d961d60d/MG-Gmail-Update-1200x630__3_.png?w=300&amp;h=158&amp;q=50&amp;fm=webp 300w,

And how do you implement them?</p><p>Here’s a detailed list:</p><p><a href="https://www.mailgun.com/blog/deliverability/email-authentication-your-id-card-sending/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">Email authentication</a> is the process of securing and confirming your sender identity through certificates and encryption. <b>The Gmail and Yahoo updates focus on validating your sender identity</b>. <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2022,</a> Gmail began to require that senders adopt <i>some form</i> of authentication, which resulted in a <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">75% drop in unauthenticated messages</a> received by Gmail users. But complex problems like spammers, phishers, and malware require equally complex solutions.</p><p>Gmail’s first task for bulk senders is that they authenticate their email by following these <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124" target="_tabs" rel="noopener noreferrer">best practices.</a> The requirement from both Gmail and Yahoo is to set up strong authentication with “SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for your domain.” Previously not a requirement, this move towards implementing DMARC is something Sinch Mailgun’s Jonathan Torres had already predicted in our guide on email security and compliance.</p><div><div><svg width="280px" height="184px" viewBox="0 -30 280 215" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><g id="Homepage-2020" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="Homepage-Desktop-01" transform="translate(-864.000000, -1808.000000)" fill="#FFFFFF"><g id="Quote-Red" transform="translate(0.000000, 1772.000000)"><path d="M1077,12 C1103.99512,12 1144,22.4392548 1144,93.5 C1144,164.560745 1086.96748,220 1028,220 L1028,172 L1028,172 C1059.89781,172 1087.5,142.097776 1087.5,120 C1058.4043,128.935547 1016,116.44552 1016,69.5 C1016,22.5544799 1050.00488,12 1077,12 Z M925,12 C951.995117,12 992,22.4392548 992,93.5 C992,164.560745 934.967484,220 876,220 L876,172 L876,172 C907.897807,172 935.5,142.097776 935.5,120 C906.404297,128.935547 864,116.44552 864,69.5 C864,22.5544799 898.004883,12 925,12 Z" id="Combined-Shape"></path></g></g></g></svg><p>“At some point, mailbox providers may decide to prioritize messages from senders that have DMARC policies set to reject or quarantine, because those are the ones they can verify and trust.
