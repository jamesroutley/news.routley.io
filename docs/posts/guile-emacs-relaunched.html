<p>The Guile-Emacs project seeks to develop new foundations for Emacs to
serve as the basis for the next forty years of development. It
integrates Emacs and Guile by providing a new Elisp implementation based
on Guile&#39;s Lisp-oriented compiler tower and runtime environment.
Guile-Emacs is being developed by a new, publicly-funded democratic
workers cooperative, founded to support development of Guile-Emacs
itself and Free Software in general. We envision Guile and Emacs being
co-developed in a sort of mutualism, along with other components of the
GNU system, and for Emacs to become a central part of what we describe
as &#34;a Lisp machine for the 21st century&#34;, and to help fulfill the
promised role of Lisp outlined in the original GNU Manifesto.</p>

<p>In this talk, I&#39;ll cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>What exactly is Guile-Emacs, in terms of its goals and general
architecture? What is it, and what is it not? Why is Guile in
particular well-suited to the goals of the project?</li>
<li>What is its history and current status? What can one already do with
Guile-Emacs?</li>
<li>What are the immediate tasks for Guile-Emacs development, and how will
they improve Guile-Emacs itself and Emacs in general?</li>
<li>How are our long-term goals for Guile-Emacs connected to the spirit of
Emacs and the GNU Project in general? What do we envision for the
future of GNU Emacs?</li>
<li>How can I get involved with and support this effort?</li>
</ul>


<p>Along the way, we&#39;ll show brief code samples and live demos of Guile&#39;s
Elisp implementation and Guile-Emacs itself.</p>

<p>About the speaker:</p>

<p>Robin Templeton is a free software advocate who enjoys programming
language design and exploring system architecture. Their fascination
with Emacs and Lisp lead them to begin work on the then-hypothetical
Guile-Emacs project during their university studies. If given the
opportunity and interest, they will bless an interested listener with a
treasure trove of obscure Lisp history.</p>

<p>Guile-Emacs seeks to provide new foundations for Emacs, integrating
Emacs and Guile via a new Elisp implementation. We envision a
significant role for Emacs within the GNU Project, becoming a central
part of a &#34;Lisp machine for the 21st century&#34;.</p>
