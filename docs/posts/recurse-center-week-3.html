<p>I am writing this in the last minutes of Sunday (read: now the first minutes of Monday), and I think that’s pretty fitting for the week I’ve had. There was plenty to do and not enough time to do it.</p>
<p>On the plus side, I am socializing a lot more both within RC and beyond it. It isn’t easy to move cities, and it’s nice to finally feel like I’m going with the flow of New York instead of against it.</p>
<p>On the minus side, my mood has fluctuated a lot this week. I’ve had some high highs (I built ResNet from scratch!) and some low lows (I cried more times this week than probably the last several years combined!). I’d settle for less low of lows.</p>
<h2 id="firsts-of-the-week">Firsts of the week</h2>
<p><strong>Eclipse!</strong>. A 6/10.</p>
<p><strong>Models from scratch!</strong>. As a part of <a href="https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0">the ARENA mechanistic interpretability course</a>, I paired with Recursers and we implemented ResNet, DCGAN, autoencoders, and backprop/autograd from scratch this week. It was daunting and exhausting and quite a bit of it is still over my head. But I know where to look to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Partial derivative of a matrix with respect to another matrix!</strong> I felt like an imposter for not being able to remember how to do this in the process of codifying matrix multiplication’s backwards function. Then I realized I never did this in my entire career or mathematics major. My next thought:</p>

<p><strong>Impossible Day!</strong> RC challenges participants to take a day to focus on something that feels entirely impossible and see how far they can get. I spent a day battling XCode and Swift to try to build an iPhone app to do some fancy computer vision stuff.</p>
<p><strong>iPhone app built!</strong> Fancy computer vision stuff TBD, but it only crashes like half the time. And I even left in some helper text so we can all know where the navbar is going for now.</p>

<p><strong>Tulips!</strong> The first tulips the city planted are blossoming in my neighborhood. I was built for this.</p>

<p>I just finished a <a href="https://github.com/zachlipp/sockpuppet-detector/">little dockerized Python web app</a> for a job interview. I had some fun with my test payloads.</p>

<p>Maybe a tie between “how autograd actually works” and “that I can re-implement important neural network architectures from scratch”</p>
<h2 id="side-quest-of-the-week">Side quest of the week</h2>
<p>Prepping for one of my cousins to visit and stay with me for a week! Cleaning, cutting copies of my keys, throwing together an itinerary, etc.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-want-to-do-better-next-week">Things I want to do better next week</h2>
<p>Keep the self talk at least neutral and stay focused.</p>

<p>I am so impressed with the work that’s gone into the ARENA study group. It’s a very challenging course on a very ambitious timeline, and I am very grateful to have had the guidance I have had along the way. Shout out to Dani Balcells, Régis Schiavi, and Changlin Li.</p>
