<h3>A weekly log of my activity at the Recurse Center, a 12-week programming retreat.</h3>

<p>Had a nice chat with Julie, learned a lot about music and music programming! She&#39;s doing cool graphics stuff, and shared a bunch of cool links with me. She also remembered my EmojipastaBot that went viral on reddit, which was a blast from the past.</p>
<p>Tried to optimise the <a href="https://github.com/Kevinpgalligan/sketches/blob/master/src/thesketches/reaction-diffusion.lisp">reaction diffusion animation</a> that Tristan and I made on Friday, which basically consisted of adding type declarations to all the simulation code. It was still pretty slow, though. When I profiled the code, it turned out that the drawing part was the real bottleneck and was taking ~28 times longer than the simulation part! We &#34;manually&#34; draw each pixel as a rectangle, which, under the hood, involves pushing vertices to the GPU. I may look into a faster way of doing it.</p>

<p>Joined the TIC-80 tour given by Quinten, it&#39;s really cool! Was struck by the idea of writing a Forth compiler with WASM as a target, which could then be run on the TIC-80. First I&#39;d better do a Forth interpreter, though.</p>
<p>Ended the day with a long debugging session, finally tracked down the bug that was causing my <code>sketch</code> refactor to break. Though, when I fixed it, it unearthed several more broken behaviours that I&#39;ll have to investigate. Tomorrow I&#39;ll focus on BitTorrent stuff.</p>
<h3 id="tuesday-january-16th">Tuesday, January 16th</h3>
<p>Enjoyed part 2 of the SuperCollider workshop! Was also listening to a cool electronic music playlist that Julie shared with me!</p>
<p>Wrote the skeleton of my BitTorrent client, hopefully I&#39;ll be handshaking with peers tomorrow! The only blocker is that most trackers are communicating over UDP, I&#39;ve only implemented the HTTP tracker protocol, and the HTTP tracker I&#39;ve been testing against was down today.</p>
<p>Had a coffee chat with Alex, enjoyed hearing about his embedded projects! Looking forward to seeing his networked videogame and model train in action.</p>
<p>I read most of <a href="https://ratfactor.com/forth/the_programming_language_that_writes_itself.html">this article</a> about Forth, I&#39;m now pretty excited to write a Forth interpreter/compiler! Especially thinking about how Lisp macros can be used to express the Forth words in a DSL, and how code can be shared between an interpreter and a machine code-generating compiler.</p>
<h3 id="wednesday-january-17th">Wednesday, January 17th</h3>
<p>Figured out the OpenGL bug in my refactoring of the sketch graphics library. The way I had restructured the main class was causing resources to be created without the OpenGL context.</p>
<p>Paired with Christopher to implement socket-based communication with other BitTorrent peers. I haven&#39;t done much byte-shuffling in Common Lisp, and I haven&#39;t done socket programming before, so this has been a slow process. I&#39;ve also discovered that the bytes of an individual peer-to-peer message are not guaranteed to arrive in the same network packet, adding an annoying layer of complexity.</p>
<p>I feel bad that I&#39;ve been the driver in all of my pairing sessions -- I&#39;m almost at the point of begging the next person to let me be the navigator! </p>
<h3 id="thursday-january-18th">Thursday, January 18th</h3>
<p>This morning, I finally submitted a <a href="https://github.com/vydd/sketch/pull/134">pull request</a> to fix a tricky bug in sketch. There are still some small changes required to ensure backwards compatibility, but I&#39;m counting this as a win!!</p>
<p>Today was Impossible Day at RC, where everyone is supposed to attempt something that seems impossible to them. I couldn&#39;t participate, though, because I was traveling to Dublin in the evening for a Lisp meetup. Maybe Friday can be my Impossible Day.</p>
<p>Tried to work on the bus but looking down was making me feel ill, ended up napping instead. Did manage to finish reading <a href="https://ratfactor.com/forth/the_programming_language_that_writes_itself.html">this overly-long article</a> about Forth. Now feeling hyped about writing a Forth interpreter. Also read some Godot articles, inspired by Quinten.</p>
<h3 id="friday-january-19th">Friday, January 19th</h3>
<p>Read through some <a href="https://kidscancode.org/godot_recipes/4.x/">Godot tutorials</a> that Quinten shared, excited to try Godot now! Also read about how other languages can interface with the engine, since that seems like it could be a fun project. They have a C API called GDExtension that has been used to, e.g., make Rust bindings. (This was actually at 3am last night when I couldn&#39;t sleep, lol).</p>
<p>Reed&#39;s enthusiasm for Forth inspired me to shuffle my priorities! Read <a href="https://ratfactor.com/forth/the_programming_language_that_writes_itself.html">this</a> overly-long but entertaining article, and am enjoying the <a href="https://github.com/nornagon/jonesforth/blob/master/jonesforth.S">jonesforth.S</a> literate implementation of Forth. I&#39;ve also started writing a Forth interpreter. The plan is to implement Forth words in the order that they appear in <a href="https://www.forth.com/starting-forth/">Starting Forth</a>.</p>
<p>Coffee chat with Kenneth, talked about shaders and graphics and how to handle motivation at RC.</p>
<p>Tweaked my <a href="https://github.com/vydd/sketch/pull/134/">pull request</a> for the sketch graphics library, trying to ensure backward compatibility even for users who rely too much on the implementation details.</p>
<p>Making a tactical retreat from the BitTorrent client because my motivation was flagging. I think I was overwhelmed by the combined complexity of the client design, the network protocol, and all the new Common Lisp packages I&#39;m being exposed to. Next week I&#39;ll divide the remaining work into tiny chunks and hopefully that will make it feel more approachable.</p>
