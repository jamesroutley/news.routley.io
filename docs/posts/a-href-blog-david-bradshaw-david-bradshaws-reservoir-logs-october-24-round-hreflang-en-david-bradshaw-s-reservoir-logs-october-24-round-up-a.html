  <div>
    <div><p>What seems to have been the first Hen Harrier for at least 25 years and first Hawfinches for seven were the highlights of an exceptional October. The month also saw a Yellow-browed Warbler caught by the ringing team as well as multiple records of Great White Egret, Osprey and Black-necked Grebe. Many of the gaps, too, in the year list were filled with Rook, Rock Pipit, Pheasant and Redpoll all added to the annual total. <br/>
</p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  
  
  <div>
          <div><p>In all, 90 species were recorded across the month with the six additions taking the year list to 143, one ahead of last year and equal to the record total in 2020. It is probably too late to add Garganey and, certainly, Common Redstart to the annual total but Pintail, Common Scoter, Mediterranean Gull, Black Redstart and Brambling could push it up by the year end close to 150.  </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>The flock of 15 <strong>Barnacle Geese</strong> regularly commuted between the reservoirs and Cheshunt with one additional bird refusing to move from its favourite feeding areas around No 5. Two <strong>Wigeon</strong> were seen on the 2nd with another on the 5th. But in general it was a poor month for wildfowl - with low numbers of <strong>Pochard </strong>and no early Goldeneye or Goosanders - although a pair of <strong>Cape Shelduck </strong>caused a ripple of excitement on the 22nd. What was the most embarrassing and inexplicable gap in the year list was closed when a <strong>Pheasant </strong>was found on the 19th. Both male and female were then - as is normal - seen regularly until the end of the month. </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>September&#39;s <strong>Black-necked Grebe</strong> remained on Lockwood and was joined by two more on the 6th with all three remaining for the month. They could be very mobile and were often separate which made counting challenging but suspicions that the total could be higher, at least on some days, were confirmed when four were found on the 29th. It is the biggest group and longest stay by the species in recent years. </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>After last month&#39;s first fly-over <strong>Great White Egrets</strong>. another was seen on the 3rd. It wasn&#39;t until the 27th that one actually put down at the Wetlands with a brief stay on &#39;Cormorant Island&#39; on No 5 before the combined attentions of Magpies and gulls drove it south again. What was likely to be the same bird was seen briefly on High Maynard next day. </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>It was an exceptional month for birds of prey,. LB, who has the advantage of having a loft window overlooking Lockwood, picked out<strong> Ospreys</strong> going south on the 14th and 25th, the third and fourth sightings of the year. <strong>Red Kites</strong> were seen on the 4th, 5th and 13th with <strong>Common Buzzards</strong> on the 6th and 12th.  But the pride of place goes to the stunning, if sadly distant, male <strong>Hen Harrier </strong>seen  and<strong> </strong>photographed by SL on the 2nd. It seems likely to be the rarest bird seen this year at the Wetlands with no one remembering any record this century.  </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>Six species of wader were seen in October - halfway between last year&#39;s eight and 2022&#39;s four. There was a solid passage of <strong>Lapwing</strong> with records on at least six days including a flock of 20 on the 27th. A <strong>Ringed Plove</strong>r was heard on the 15th, a <strong>Black-tailed Godwit </strong>seen on 28th and the sole <strong>Redshank</strong> was on on High Maynard on the 10th. <strong>Common Snipe</strong> put in regular appearances particularly on the East Warwick island . <strong>Common Sandpipers</strong> were recorded throughout the month with a peak count of three on 4th and 9th with one staying at the north end of High Maynard - just like last year&#39;s winterer - until the end of the month.  </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>As usual, there was an October passage of <strong>Jackdaw</strong>, mostly in small numbers but including a flock of 60 on the 11th. The only two Rooks of the year were seen by EDH on the 4th. They remain very scarce at the Wetlands with none seen in 2023. A <strong>Coal Tit</strong>, again a scarce visitor although they seem to be getting slightly more frequent, was seen by PL on the 5th. <strong>Skylarks</strong> also passed over towards the end of the month with six on both the 26th &amp; 27th and 11 on the 31st.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>The ringing team hit gold this month, picking both <strong>Yellow-browed Warbler</strong> and <strong>Firecrest </strong>out of their nets around the No 1 reedbed<strong>. </strong>The Yellow-browed, caught on the 12th, is only the second or third record for the reservoirs. It came during an exceptional influx of these beautiful Siberian visitors into London and across the UK which also saw another unrung bird appear two days later just over the reservoirs&#39; boundary fence on Walthamstow Marsh. To add to the excitement, the team caught a stunning Firecrest - the second record of the year - on the 18th. Unlike the Yellow-browed which disappeared after being released, it was seen with a tit flock on the 1/2/3 path next day. </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>The final summer visitors departed with three <strong>Swallows</strong> on the 1st with a late bird feeding over No 5 on the 20th. The last <strong>House Martins</strong> were 30 counted on the 7th.  Single  <strong>Wheatears</strong> were recorded on the 1st, 5th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th with the last of the month on the 27th. A late <strong>Yellow Wagtai</strong>l was sound recorded over the reservoirs on the 21st. </p>
<p>As the summer visitors leave, they are usually replaced by winter thrushes. But it looked as if October was unusally going to pass without a single <strong>Fieldfare</strong> being recorded before five dropped in to the berry bushes near the Engine House on the 31st.  <strong>Redwing </strong>passage was stronger with several hundred seen and heard going over on the 12th and a few using the reservoirs to feed. Wintering <strong>Stonechats</strong> have taken up residence around the Warwicks with up to four birds seen. </p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  
  <div>
          <div><p>With no Spring records of <strong>Rock Pipit</strong> this year, the bird found over East Warwick by SD on the 5th was the first of the year. It was followed by other records on the 7th, 11th, 20th, 21st and a bird with an injured leg on the 26th &amp; 27th. </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>The last <strong>Hawfinches</strong> seen over the reservoirs were five over Lockwood during the last big influx year in 2017. SD went one better this month when he photographed one over East Warwick on the 20th followed by five more again over Lockwood on the 26th. The same day and reservoir saw DDL pick up the first <strong>Redpoll </strong>of the year, 18 days later than the first record last year. <strong>Siskin</strong> were much more regular with records on or over the reservoirs on at least ten days with 13 on the 31st. </p></div>
