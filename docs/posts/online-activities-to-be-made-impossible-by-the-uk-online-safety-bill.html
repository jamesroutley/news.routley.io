    <h1>Ask HN: Online activities to be made impossible by the UK Online Safety Bill</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I thought it might be interesting to compile a list of things which it might be impossible (or at least very difficult) for a private individual to do under the Online Safety Bill.</p><p>Starters for ten:</p><p>1) Minecraft / MineTest server
2) IRC server
3) Mastodon server
4) BBS
5) ... please continue</p><p>I&#39;m not fully sure about all this - as I understand it, if you allow chat or user generated content, you become a private service provider, and then have a host of responsibilities including annual audits of whether a significant proportion of your users are minors. If they are then you need to use a (commercial?) age verification tool and monitor everything assiduously. Difficult to see most people being able to satisfy those requirements.</p></div></div></div>
