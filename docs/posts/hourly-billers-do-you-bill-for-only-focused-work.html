    <h1>Ask HN: Hourly billers, do you bill for only focused work?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have noticed that trying to bill at higher rates has been becoming more difficult and if I don&#39;t work a full 8 hours it appears that I am slacking off. The vast majority of software engineers do not do 8 hours of actual work, even including meetings.</p><p>However, I sometimes notice other contractors billing a full 40-hour work week and clients not batting an eye.</p><p>Am I being too honest, and should I continue billing for the fifteen minutes I go off reading HN, having lunch, or any other short break?</p><p>Edit: I guess what I meant to say, is lowering my rate by around 25%, but also being less picky on what I should bill so that I can earn the same amount, acceptable?</p></div></div></div>
