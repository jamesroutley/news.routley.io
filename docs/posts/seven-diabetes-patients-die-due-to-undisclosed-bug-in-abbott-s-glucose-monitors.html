    <h1>Seven Diabetes Patients Die Due to Undisclosed Bug in Abbott&#39;s Glucose Monitors</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>I <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/blog/2025/nov/06/juggluco-foss-continuous-glucose-montior-diabetes/">wrote
    last month</a> about my diabetes diagnosis this year and my
  difficult choice to wear a proprietary device (called a
  <acronym title="continuous glucose monitor">CGM</acronym>) on my arm 24/7
  to continuously monitor my glucose levels. Like my friend and colleague,
  Karen M. Sandler — who previously made a much higher-stakes choice to
  receive a proprietary implanted defibrillator to keep her safe given her
  genetic heart condition — I reluctantly chose to attach proprietary
  hardware and software to my body.</p>

<p>The device itself is quite proprietary, but fortunately
    the <acronym title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</acronym>
    community has reverse engineered its activation and data collection
    protocols — creating an Android application that does a better job
    than the manufacturers&#39; proprietary ones<sup><a id="return-juggluco-previous-post" href="#footnote-juggluco-previous-post">0</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Here in the USA, we strangely use capitalism as the center of our health care system. Two major for-profit competing brands of <acronym title="continuous glucose monitor">CGM</acronym> are
  available here.  My diabetes specialist prefers the (ironically named)
  Freestyle Libre Plus from Abbott.  I (also rather strangely) bring a prescription
  for <em>electronics</em> to a pharmacy every month. On 2025-12-03, that pharmacy sent me an alarming text message (shown here). </p>

<h3>Abbott Killed Seven Patients</h3>

<p>After reading that text, I
  found <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/medical-device-recalls-and-early-alerts/early-alert-glucose-monitor-sensor-issue-abbott-diabetes-care">the
  USA <acronym title="Food and Drug Administration">FDA</acronym> announcement</a>.  My spouse cross-referenced the lot numbers while I read them off from all my Freestyle boxes<sup><a id="return-no-match-abbott-site" href="#footnote-no-match-abbott-site">1</a></sup>.  I had indeed recently worn an
impacted device!</p>

<p>Only because my diabetes is so early of a stage was I relatively safe.  The FDA
  reports that Freestyle injured over 700 people  and <strong>killed seven
  people</strong> with this bug.  Specifically, the bug caused the device to falsely report an
  <em>extremely low</em> glucose level.  Advanced stage diabetics use low
  reading information to inform them that they may have too much insulin
  currently.  The usual remedy is to eat something sugary to raise glucose in the blood. 
   Such should be done only with great care, as a false low reading can harm and even kill the patient (who eats a high-sugar-content item while glucose in the blood is, in fact, not low).</p>
  
<p>Proprietary software in medical devices harming patients is not new.  In
  1985,
  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25#Problem_description">Therac-25
  killed three people</a>.  In 2020, hundreds of patients who relied on a financially troubled tech startup found their occular implants suddenly unsupported. Some patients went <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-eye-obsolete">blind as the devices powered down without updates</a>.  There are more examples that I could include here, but rereading these horrific stories is frankly more than I can take right now when I think of fellow diabetes sufferers who were “killed by code” recently..</p>


<h3>Would FOSS Have Saved Patients&#39; Lives?</h3>
                              
<p>It&#39;s hubris for activists to guarantee that harm would be prevented if Freestyle had publicly released the
  hardware specifications and the complete, corresponding source code
  (<abbr>CCS</abbr>).
  <acronym title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</acronym> isn&#39;t immune to bugs —
  even dangerous ones.  However, in the centuries since the Enlightenment, we
  know that the scientific method <em>depends</em> on public disclosure about
  data and wide-reaching peer review of past work.  FOSS (plus a publicly disclosed
  hardware design) wouid allow the millions of hardware and software engineers to
  peer-review the integrity, security, and safety of the devices to which
  patients entrust their lives.  We achieve the promise of humanity when we
  each entrust our safety and health to our entire community — not
  merely a single for-profit entity.</p>

<p>We also will probably never know whether this issue was in hardware or
  software.  The bug disclosure is incredibly vague, and it remains unclear
  how much investigation was done (if any) by government regulators into this
  problem.  As a public policy and public health matter, the
  public <em>deserves to know</em> the technical details (software and
  hardware) of both the functioning device and the failed devices.  NGOs should be permitted to perform
  their own investigations and confirmations of public safety.</p>

<h3>What&#39;s Next?</h3>

<p>Given that the hardware, software, and medical for-profit industries
refuse to put the rights, safety and security of patients first, wrongful
death lawsuits are typically the only way to hold these companies
  accountable.  Yet, there are <em>very few</em> people who have not agreed
Abbott&#39;s toxic terms of their
  proprietary companion application — I guestimate 
that fewer than 1% of
  Freestyle-using patients have used Juggluco from their very start (and
  thus never agreed to Abbott&#39;s terms).  This is significant because Abbott <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/videos/2025-09_Abbott-Freestyle-Libre-Plus-App-Agreement.pdf#page=78">includes a
  comprehensive one-way indemnity for themselves in the terms</a>.  I hope that a
  class action suit begins soon on this matter, but I wonder and worry that
  so much of the class may have signed this indemnity (which may make the road to justice
  bumpier).</p>

<p>Finally, I want to offer that if there is anyone out there who does
  tear-downs of extremely tiny electronic devices, I would be thrilled to
  find a volunteer who would like to see if we can either extract any
  software components from the device, or reverse-engineer the hardware.  I
  have saved and sanitized all of my prior <acronym title="continuous glucose monitors">CGMs</acronym>.
  I&#39;d gladly send one along
  to anyone who wants to give a try at taking them apart. (Contact SFC or <a rel="me" href="https://fedi.copyleft.org/@bkuhn">contact me on the Fediverse (via Mastodon)</a> if you&#39;re available to do this work.)</p>

<p>For my part, I look forward (after the <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/vizio">Vizio</a> trial) to
 sending some patches to
  Juggluco and also getting Juggluco available in F-Droid.  Our best option in the face of
  these powerful medical device companies curtailing our rights is to invest
  our volunteer time into the edges where
  <acronym title="Free and Open Source Software">FOSS</acronym> has
  resiliently worked around the constant roadblocks erected by bad
  actors.</p>

<p><sup><a id="footnote-no-match-abbott-site" href="#return-no-match-abbott-site">1</a></sup> In a fascinating turn of events, at least one of my past monitors (of which I fortitously saved all the boxes with the lot/serial number on them) is listed in <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/189900/download?attachment">the FDA&#39;s spreadsheet</a> as recalled lot, yet the serial number is listed as “ safe to use” on <a href="https://www.freestylecheck.com/us-en/product-lookup.html">Abbott&#39;s webform</a>  🤔 … I&#39;m left wondering how I can trust Abbott to write reliable software stuck into my arm if they can&#39;t even write a web form that cross-references serial numbers to lots correctly 😬. </p>
