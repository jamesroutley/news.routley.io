I’ve noticed this a bit over the weeks, but I have now learned that the convection oven setting on the oven may not be the best setting for cookies and over baked goods. I took my cookies out and I noticed that there was much more browning than I expected. The cookies had also lost the moisture.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1oj3fha">I looked it up and I came across Bob’s Red Mill <a href="https://www.bobsredmill.com/blog/healthy-living/convection-oven-vs-regular-oven/" rel="nofollow">blog</a> that goes into detail about the baking differences between the two settings. I will need to change the order on the selection menu for baking on my oven now!</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1fqi6aw">Also I noticed that my cookies were thinner and spread out more than the recipe showed. I would like to redo these to see if I can have a better understanding of why they weren’t thick and pillowy like in the photo.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div> </div> </article></div>
