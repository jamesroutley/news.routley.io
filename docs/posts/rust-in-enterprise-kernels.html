    <h1>Rust in enterprise kernels</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
At the recently concluded Maintainers Summit, it was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/991062/">generally agreed that the Rust experiment would
continue</a>, and that the path was clear for more Rust code to enter the
kernel.  But the high-level view taken at such gatherings cannot always
account for the difficult details that will inevitably arise as the Rust
work proceeds.  A recent discussion on the nouveau mailing list may have
escaped the notice of many, but it highlights some of the problems that
will have to be worked out as important functionality written in Rust heads
toward the mainline.
</p><h4>The players</h4>
<p>
Some context to begin: the <a href="https://nouveau.freedesktop.org/">nouveau driver</a> handles NVIDIA
GPUs.  It was, for years, the product of a determined reverse-engineering
effort in the absence of any help from NVIDIA; it was <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/366648/">first merged into the mainline</a> for the 2.6.33
release in 2009.  More recently, NVIDIA <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/953144/">has
been changing its tune</a> with regard to free-software support for its
products, and has been helping with nouveau development.  Ben Skeggs, who
has worked on nouveau for years, recently took up employment there.
</p><p>
Nouveau has reached a reasonable level of functionality, but the developers
in the kernel&#39;s DRM (graphics) subsystem are already looking at replacing
it, at least for newer GPUs.  Specifically, the <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/nouveau/Zfsj0_tb-0-tNrJy@cassiopeiae/">Nova project</a> has been
launched to create a new driver for NVIDIA GPUs going forward.  Unlike
nouveau, Nova will be written in Rust.  The developers involved feel that
using Rust is the best way to cope with the firmware interface in newer
GPUs, which can change at any time without notice.  Nova is a relatively
young project that may not be ready to enter the mainline for, possibly,
some years.
</p><p>
An entirely different part of the kernel is the <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/driver-api/vfio.html">Virtual Function I/O
(VFIO) subsystem</a>.  In short, VFIO is an interface for the control of
I/O memory-management units (IOMMUs) that can be used to safely give access
to a device to a user-space process.  The IOMMU will ensure that the device
only has access to the memory belonging to the process using it, preventing
the device from (accidentally or deliberately) overwriting other parts of
the system.  VFIO is often used in systems running virtualized guests; each
guest can be given access to the devices it needs while keeping the system
as a whole secure.
</p><p>
To complete the cast of characters: in late September, Zhi Wang posted <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240922124951.1946072-1-zhiw@nvidia.com">a 23-part patch
set</a> implementing a new &#34;vGPU&#34; functionality for NVIDIA GPUs.  There is
an increasing market for cloud-based systems with GPU access so that we can
all enjoy the benefits of large language models appearing uninvited in
every aspect of our lives.  The vGPU patches make it easy for cloud
providers to give virtual machines access to one or more GPUs and to
arbitrate the use of those GPUs when contention occurs.  NVIDIA clearly
thinks, probably with good reason, that this feature will make its GPUs
more attractive to cloud providers, which are known to purchase a
nontrivial amount of hardware.  Befitting NVIDIA&#39;s more upstream-friendly
approach, all of this work is aimed at the mainline kernel.
</p><h4>Backporting worries</h4>
<p>
This new subsystem, as one might expect, is based on VFIO, meaning that the
interfaces the kernel already exports for virtualized device control will
work with NVIDIA GPUs.  This decision is uncontroversial.  But the vGPU
work also depends on the nouveau driver for access to the hardware, and
makes significant changes to nouveau to add the support it needs.  This
aspect attracted the attention of the developers behind Nova, who were
concerned about basing this functionality on a driver that they are working
to replace.  The plan is that the chipsets to be managed by vGPU will be
driven by Nova, so it is natural to want to see all of this work done there
instead.
</p><p>
Danilo Krummrich <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/ZvErg51xH32b8iW6@pollux">asked</a> what
the strategy for vGPU was in the longer term: &#34;<q>Is this more of a proof
of concept? Do you plan to work on Nova in general and vGPU support for
Nova?</q>&#34; Jason Gunthorpe, who has seemingly had a hand in the design of
the new subsystem, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240923150140.GB9417@nvidia.com">answered</a> that it &#34;<q>is
intended to be a real product that customers would use, it is not a proof
of concept</q>&#34;.  He is hoping to see it merged soon, he said.  He finished
by saying: &#34;<q>As a commercial product this will be backported extensively
to many old kernels and that is harder/impossible if it isn&#39;t exclusively
in C.</q>&#34;
</p><p>
In other words, the new vGPU subsystem will be backported by distributors
(and large-scale users) into &#34;enterprise&#34; kernels that, at their core,
predate the introduction of Rust support into the mainline; Gunthorpe <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240926144057.GZ9417@nvidia.com">estimated</a> that only 10%
of the kernels running on the target systems are based on 6.0 or newer
releases.  Since the initial Rust support only landed in 6.1, and it is far
from complete even now, any sort of Rust dependency will clearly make
backporting vGPU harder, if indeed it can be done at all.  The result could
be that the vGPU subsystem doesn&#39;t find its way into those older kernels at
all, which would be disappointing for many of the people (and companies)
involved.  Thus, Gunthorpe concluded, vGPU must remain based on nouveau for
now, and the Nova project has to somehow live with that.
</p><p>
Krummrich <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/ZvHwzzp2F71W8TAs@pollux.localdomain">acknowledged</a> that
using nouveau for now is a reasonable approach, but worried that the
addition of Nova would lead to a duplication of functionality within the
kernel.  To avoid that, he said, there needed to be an agreement that the
vGPU developers would, in the longer term, commit to helping with Nova
development and the movement of vGPU to a Nova base.  Gunthorpe <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240924164151.GJ9417@nvidia.com">agreed</a> that Nova might
someday become the base for vGPU but pointed out that, while vGPU is a
working driver that may be merged soon, Nova does not yet exist; &#34;<q>let&#39;s
not get too far ahead of ourselves here</q>&#34;.


</p><h4>Disagreement and options</h4>
<p>
What followed was an occasionally heated discussion where the participants
did not always seem to be understanding each other.  Gunthorpe <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240924234737.GO9417@nvidia.com">suggested</a> that a core
driver (written inÂ C) could be created with just enough functionality
to allow higher-level drivers to communicate with the devices; nouveau and
Nova could both sit on top of that core driver.  DRM maintainer Dave
Airlie, though, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/CAPM=9tx+uU=uceg=Zr4N9=Y28j8kHnBVD+J9sf9xkfJ1xtTXEA@mail.gmail.com">insisted</a>
that the lowest levels need to be in Rust:
</p><blockquote>
	The core has to be rust, because NVIDIA has an unstable firmware
	API.  The unstable firmware API isn&#39;t some command marshalling,
	it&#39;s deep down into the depths of it, like memory sizing
	requirements, base message queue layout and encoding, firmware init
	procedures. These are all changeable at any time with no regard for
	upstream development, so upstream development needs to be insulated
	from these as much as possible. Using rust provides that insulation
	layer.
</blockquote>
<p>
He suggested that there could be ways to plan the transition to make life
as easy as possible on the VFIO side.  Gunthorpe <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240925012935.GQ9417@nvidia.com">answered</a> that: &#34;<q>We
can&#39;t have rust in VFIO right now, we don&#39;t have that luxury. This is just
a fact, I can&#39;t change it.</q>&#34;.  He also said that his objection to Rust
in VFIO would be somewhat reduced &#34;<q>if the backporting can be shown to be
solved</q>&#34;.  Perhaps, he said, a minimal core driver could be written in
Rust as an alternative to a C version, and that could be used to see how
hard the backporting problem really is.
</p><p>
With regard to backporting, Greg Kroah-Hartman <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/2024092614-fossil-bagful-1d59@gregkh">advised</a> Gunthorpe
to &#34;<q>never make design decisions based on old ancient commercial kernels
that [don&#39;t] have any relevance to upstream kernel development today</q>&#34;.
If companies are interested in having vGPU support in enterprise kernels,
he said, they should just pay for the backporting of the necessary patches
into those kernels.  Gunthorpe <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/20240926124239.GX9417@nvidia.com">replied</a> that he is not
ready to accept any such dependency until the kernel community has decided
that Rust support is no longer experimental.  He also expressed hope that
the problem would just go away:
</p><blockquote>
	This argument is *way too early*. I&#39;m deeply hoping we never have
	to actually have it, that by the time Nova gets merged Rust will be
	100% ready upstream and there will be no issue. Please? Can that
	happen?
</blockquote>
<p>
The conversation eventually just faded away.  In the short term, there are
no decisions that need to be made; the only way for vGPU to work in current
mainline kernels is to use nouveau, so it would be surprising indeed if it
were not merged in that form.  Even the Nova developers have not argued
against that.  In the longer term, with luck, things will play out as
Gunthorpe hopes and, when Nova is ready to go upstream, the course of
action there will be clear as well.
</p><p>
Perhaps life will not be quite that easy, but there is reason for optimism
anyway.  While the positions on both sides appeared to be absolute, all of
the developers involved have shown interest in finding solutions that would
work for everybody.  There is no disagreement over the long-term goals that
the community is working toward, and there is reason to believe that an
agreement will be found on how to get there.

</p><p>
Some of the themes that came up in this discussion are likely to recur,
though.  <i>Any</i> functionality that is dependent on Rust code is going
to be a challenge to backport to ancient enterprise kernels, so merging
that code may draw opposition, even from developers who are supportive of
Rust in general.  At some point, if the Rust project is going to succeed,
the kernel will have to make that leap.  Expect some further discussions,
though, on just when that point should be reached.<br clear="all"/></p><table>
