    <p><SPAN face="Arial" size="3"><strong>The first Soviet calculators</strong></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The habitual language used today when working with
    calculators only appeared at the beginning of the 70&#39;s. In general, the first models of
    calculators had their own operational language, and the user had to learn the specific
    procedures related to each calculator. Let&#39;s take, for example, the C3-07, the first
    calculator of the Series &#34;C&#34; manufactured by the Leningrad factory
    &#34;Svetlana.&#34;  By the way, as a parentheses, it is interesting to note that
    all calculators produced by the factory &#34;Svetlana&#34; were independent of other
    Russian electronic appliances. All electronic calculators manufactured during those years
    received the common designation  &#34;B3&#34;. The desktop electronic
    clocks received the code &#34;B2&#34;, electronic watches - &#34;B5&#34; (for
    example, B5-207), desktop electronic devices with  vacuum display were identified
    with codes &#34;B6,&#34; &#34;B7,&#34; and so on. The &#34;B&#34; is the  first
    letter of &#34;Home appliances&#34; in Russian.  Svetlana&#39;s calculators where the
    only ones identified with a letter &#34;C&#34; - Svetlana means the light of an electric
    lamp  (CBETLAHA - SVET LAmpochki NAkalivaniya) and is also a popular women&#39;s name in
    Russia.</SPAN></p>
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/C3-07key.jpg" alt="Keyboard of C3-07" width="200" height="177"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Here is the keyboard of the C3-07 calculator. This
    was a very surprising calculator, especially because of its keyboard and display. As it is
    can be seen in the image,  the calculator combined not only the functions [+=]
    and  [-=], but also the multiply-divide functions [X -:-]. Try to guess how to
    multiply and to divide in this calculator. A hint: the calculator does not recognize two
    sequential keystrokes on the same key, only one keystroke is possible for each key. The
    answer is no less than surprising: to  multiply, say 2 by 3, it is necessary to press
    the following keys [2] [X-:-] [3] [+=], while to divide 2 by 3, the following sequence is
    applied: [2] [X-:-] [3]  [-=]. The addition and subtraction is made in a similar way
    (as the one applied in the B3-04 calculator) that is, to perform the difference 2 - 3 the
    following sequence is used: [2] [+=] [3] [-=]. </SPAN></p>
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/C307dig.jpg" alt=" Display of C3-07" width="83" height="125"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Another surprise is the eight elements used to
    build a number in the display as shown in the figure at the left.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Starting with this model, all simple calculators made by
    the Svetlana&#39;s factory operated with exponential numbers up to 10e16-1, even when the
    display had only a capacity of eight or twelve digits. If the result exceeded 8 or 12
    digits (depending on the model), the decimal comma disappeared and  the display
    showed the first 8 or 12 digits of the number.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Speaking about the operational language of early
    calculators, it is necessary to mention that in the B3-02, B3-05 and C3-07 calculators of
    the type &#34;Iskra&#34;, the result of the calculations used all digits of the display
    filling with zeroes the unused positions. It was certainly inconvenient to find on such
    calculators the first (and last) significant digit. By the way, in model C3-07, which was
    mentioned before,  there was an attempt to lessen a little bit this problem by
    applying an unusual method - on this calculator the zero has half of the height. Also,
    these calculators had a very inconvenient, but quite explicable for early calculators,
    feature: the required accuracy of the calculations was set by the number of significant
    digits entered on the first number. For example, to calculate the quotient of division 23
    by 32 to three decimal digits, the number 23 had to be entered with three decimal digits:
    |23,000| [-:-] |32| [=] (0.718). So long as the operator didn&#39;t press the reset button,
    all subsequent calculations were made with three decimal digits, and the decimal point
    would remain fixed in the same position all the time. These calculators, by the way, were
    referred to as &#34;fixed point&#34; calculators.   Later calculators, in
    which the point moved on the display, were referred to as   &#34;floating
    point&#34; calculators. Now, the terminology has changed, and &#34;floating point&#34;
    is used to describe displays where a number is represented by a mantissa at the left and
    the exponent order at the right.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial"><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B309.jpg" alt="Elektronika B3-09M" width="112" height="208"/>One year after development of the first B3-04 pocket
    calculator, appeared the new perfected MK models:  B3-09M, B3-14 and B3-14M. These
    calculators were built with one K145IK2  microprocessor, and one microchip used as
    oscillator clock. The calculator B3-09M is shown at the left. The same casing was also
    used for the B3-14M. These models had already a &#34;standard&#34; operational language
    which included calculations with a constant.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">These calculators could work with a power unit, or with
    four (B3-09M, B3-14M) or three AA batteries (B3-14).</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Although the three calculators used the same chip, they had
    different functionality. In general, &#34;removing&#34; some functions was a typical
    practice in many models of Soviet calculators. For example, the B3-09M calculator did not
    have square root function, and the B3-14M was not good for percent calculations. As an
    additional feature,  the decimal point took the place of a full digit. This made
    easier to read the information, but the last sign digit was lost. Before starting an
    operation (after turning the power on) it was necessary to press the &#34;C&#34; key in
    order to clear the registers.</SPAN></p>
    <hr/>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial" size="3"><strong>The first soviet engineering calculator</strong></SPAN></p>
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B318a.jpg" alt="Elektronika B3-18A" width="160" height="284"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The next huge step in the history of Soviet
    calculators was the development, completed by the end of 1975, of the B3-18, the first
    engineering calculator. As stated in the article &#34;Fantastic Electronics&#34;
    published in &#34;Science and Life&#34; magazine, No. 10, 1976:  &#34;...this
    calculator has crossed the Rubicon of arithmetic, its mathematical capability has stepped
    into trigonometry and algebra. &#34;Elektronika B3-18&#34; is able to raise instantly a
    square and extract a square root, it can raise any number to any degree in just two steps
    within the limits of eight digits, can convert dimensions, calculate the logarithms,
    antilogarithms, and trigonometric functions ... It is difficult to understand the huge
    amount of work that this machine performs in few seconds while it folds huge numbers to
    perform an algebraic or trigonometric operation before lighting the result in the
    display...&#34;</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">And this was true, a huge amount work was made. To make
    this possible, 45,000  transistors, resistors, condensers and conductors were packed
    in a uniform crystal with the size of  5x5.2 mm. This was equivalent to fifty TV sets
    of those years pushed into the square of an arithmetic exercise-book!</SPAN><SPAN face="Arial"> </SPAN><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">  However, the price of such
    calculator was considerable - 220 roubles in 1978.   As an example, in those years
    the salary of an engineer who just graduated from a technical institute was 120 roubles
    per month. But it worth to purchase one. The logarithmic slide rule was no longer
    necessary, and the margin of error was no longer a concern. Now it was possible to throw
    the tables of logarithms into the shelf.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">By the way, a prefix function key &#34;F&#34; was used
    for the first time in this calculator.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Nevertheless it was not possible to include all the desired
    functionality into the microcircuit K145IP7 of the B3-18 calculator. For example, in order
    to evaluate a function in which the Taylor decomposition of a number was required, the
    working register was cleared, and therefore the previous result of the operation was
    erased. In this context it was impossible to make sequential calculations such as 5 + sin
    2. For this purpose it was necessary first to find the sine of 2, and only then add the
    result to  5.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">So the main effort was made, and the result was a good but
    very expensive calculator. In order to make the calculator accessible to the mass segments
    of the population, it was decided  make a cheaper model based on the B3-18A. To avoid
    reinventing the wheel, engineers took the easiest way: removing the prefix key
    &#34;F&#34; and all the function keys from the calculator. So the calculator became a
    simple calculator and was named &#34;B3-25A.&#34;  Only the developers and
    calculator repairmen knew about the secret alteration made to produce the B3-25A...</SPAN></p>
    <hr/>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial" size="3"><strong>The further development of calculators</strong></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">After the B3-18, the B3-19M calculator was developed with
    the participation of engineers from the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic
    (GDR). This calculator used RPN (Reverse Polish Notation). Once the first number is
    entered, pressing the input key pushes the number into the stack <img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B-strel.jpg" alt="Enter number into stack" width="30" height="27"/>, then the second number is
    entered, and only then the required operator key is pressed. The stack in this calculator
    consists of three registers - X, Y and Z. This calculator was the first to accept and
    display numbers in floating point format (with mantissa and exponent). It used a 12-digit
    red LED display.</SPAN></p>
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/C315.jpg" alt="Elektronika C3-15" width="83" height="150"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">In 1977,  another very powerful engineering
    calculator was introduced, the C3-15. This calculator had increased calculation accuracy
    (up to 12 numbers), worked with exponents up to 9.999999999e99, had three registers of
    memory, but most remarkable: worked with algebraic logic. That is, to calculate the
    expression 2 + 3 * 5 it was no longer necessary to calculate first 3 * 5, and then add 2
    to the result. This expression could be written down in a &#34;natural&#34; way: [2] [+]
    [3] [*] [5] [=]. Besides, the calculator supported up to eight levels of brackets. This
    calculator, together with its desktop brother MK-41 were the only ones having a
    &#34;/p/&#34; key. This key was used for calculations under the formula sqrt (x ^ 2 + y
    ^ 2)</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial"><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B326.jpg" alt="Elektronika B3-26" width="150" height="268"/>In 1977, the K145IP11 microprocessor was developed and
    it was used as the basis for a whole series of calculators. The first of them was the well
    known B3-26 calculator (displayed on the right). Then the (B3-09M, B3-14, B3-14M) and
    (B3-18A, B3-25A) calculators were crafted with identical look, just by removing some
    functions.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Based on the B3-26 calculator, the B3-23 (with percents),
    the B3-23A (with square root) and the B3-24G (with memory) were made. By the way, priced
    at 18 roubles,  the B3-23A calculator subsequently became the cheapest Soviet
    calculator. The B3-26 was soon named as MK-26 and so was its brother MK-57 and the MK-57A,
    which had similar functions.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Svetlana&#39;s factory launched model C3-27, which in reality
    did not have success, and soon was replaced by the very popular and cheap model C3-33
    (MK-33).</SPAN></p>
    
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B335.jpg" alt="Elektronika B3-35" width="120" height="217"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">One more direction in  the development of microcalculators were
    the engineering calculators  B3-35 (MK-35) and B3-36 (MK-36). B3-35 differed from
    B3-36 by having a simpler design and costing five roubles less. These calculators were
    able to convert degrees into radians and vice versa,  multiply and divide numbers in
    memory, and also calculate a factorial.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">It was very interesting the way these calculators
    calculated a factorial - simple sort out. The calculation of the  factorial for the
    maximum value of 69 took more than five seconds on the B3-35 calculator. </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">These calculators were very popular in the USSR, although
    they had, on my opinion, a defect: they displayed too few significant figures, as many as
    the precision guaranteed in the manual. They usually had five to six digits for
    transcendental functions. </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The desktop variant MK-45 was based on these calculators.
    By the way, many pocket engineering calculators had their desktop counterparts, for
    example: EPOS 73A (B3-26), MK-41 (C3-15), MKSCH-2 (B3-30), and MK-45 (B3-35, B3-36).</SPAN></p>
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B332.jpg" alt="Elektronika B3-32" width="150" height="248"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The calculator MKSCH-2 - became the standard &#34;school&#34;
    calculator  - Except for some demonstration units, it was produced by the Soviet
    industry for exclusive use at schools. This calculator, as well as the non-RPN  B3-32
    calculator (shown at the left) was able to calculate the roots of a quadratic equation and
    find the roots of a system of two equations with two unknown variables. On its appearance
    this calculator is completely identical to the B3-14 calculator.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">All key inscriptions follow the western standards. For
    example, the key to record a number in memory was designated &#34;STO&#34; instead
    of  &#34;P&#34; or &#34;x - &gt; P&#34;. The key to   recall a number from
    memory was designated &#34;RCL,&#34; and so on.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Despite the capability to handle numbers with large
    exponents, this  calculator used the same eight-digit display of the B3-14
    calculator. The developers decided to display floating point numbers with the mantissa and
    the exponent, leaving room only for five significant digits. To address this
    problem,  the calculator was provided with a &#34;CN&#34; key.  For example,
    if the result of a calculation was the number 1.2345678e-12,   the display showed
    1.2345-12. By pressing [F] [CN],  the display showed 12345678. The decimal point was
    omitted.</SPAN></p>
    <hr/>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial" size="3"><strong>The first Soviet programmable calculator</strong></SPAN></p>
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B321.jpg" alt="Elektronika B3-21" width="150" height="297"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The first Soviet programmable calculator B3-21 (shown at the right)
    was developed by the end of 1977 and sold at the beginning of  1978. It was one large
    step forward. Before, users had to repeat calculations many times, and calculators had a
    maximum of three memory registers. Now users were able to write programs and store
    instructions and numbers in memory. The term &#34;programmable calculator&#34; caused
    awe and some shivering of voice. It was a very expensive calculator - it cost the whole
    350 roubles!  Soon calculators were conferred a mark of quality.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The first models of the Elektronika B3-21 had a red LED
    display. The comma used one full position in the display. Later the display was changed to
    green fluorescent but this made its operation slower by 20 %.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The calculator worked with Reverse Polish Notation, this
    required to enter first the two numbers and then the operator. After entering the first
    number it was necessary to press the upward arrow key <img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B-strel.jpg" alt="ENTER" width="30" height="27"/>. Except for two operational registers X and Y, the calculator had a circular
    stack   consisting of six registers. The stack of numbers was connected to the
    register X. Special keys allowed to move the numbers clockwise and counter-clockwise
    within the circular stack. In addition to the circular stack and the X and Y registers,
    this calculator had seven storage registers (#2  to #8).</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The calculator had two operation prefix keys -
    &#34;F&#34; and &#34;P.&#34; The &#34;F&#34; key was black and the &#34;P&#34; key
    was red. Prefix keys were also used to store and recall numbers from the registers. The
    &#34;P&#34; key was used to store, while the &#34;F&#34; key was used to recall.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">But still the main feature of the  B3-21 calculator
    has not been mentioned yet - the ability to program! The calculator supported 60 steps of
    program, and the addresses were named with a module of six, therefore the addresses had
    the following order: 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 10, 11 and so on. Each key had an operation
    code. The calculator had functions for unconditional transfer, transfer to subroutines,
    and also conditional branching. The branching keys used two  memory locations on the
    calculator - one cell to store the operation code, and another to maintain the branch
    address. The required transfer address was equal to the code corresponding to the transfer
    key minus 1. For example, in order to jump to address 33, it was necessary to press keys
    [BP] and [3] (code 34). The operation codes were taken from a table.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial"><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/Ychoice.jpg" alt="Book &#34;Calculator - your move!&#34;" width="150" height="206"/>Suddenly,
    the first programmable calculator became very popular in Russia. Now the user could not
    only write complex programs, but also play games with the calculator. It was an
    unprecedented innovation!  Literature on engineering programming with the
    programmable calculator started to appear. At the left, a very popular book of those years
    devoted to games and other useful programs for the B3-21..</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial"><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/Mc1103.jpg" alt="Elektronika MC 1103" width="150" height="118"/>The introduction of the programmable calculator B3-21
    allowed to automate production control operations. Several desktop variants of this
    calculator - MK-46, MK-64 and MC1103 (figure on the right) were manufactured. They were
    large desktop calculators with special sockets in the back.  These sockets were
    linked to an additional register 9 used to store the &#34;experiment name&#34; code. In
    these calculators it was possible to input the data  both from the keyboard, and from
    external systems such as gauges, analog-digital converters and other devices. They
    processed the data to carry out operations such as size tolerance in quality control,
    and to print the data and  results with the help of  external systems. The MK-64
    (AKA MC1103) differed from the MK-46 by the availability of a built-in digital-to-analog
    converter. Many  MK-64 calculators were installed in physics laboratories of
    specialized technical schools, as they used to say, to measure the voltage of a battery.</SPAN></p>
    <hr/>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial" size="3"><strong>The most popular Soviet calculator</strong></SPAN></p>
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B334.jpg" alt="Elektronika B3-34" width="152" height="302"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The first programmable calculators B3-21, MK-46
    and MK-64, although worked under the control of a program,  had only two operational
    registers X and Y, and  working with the circular stack was very inconvenient. This
    was changed in 1980 by the programmable calculator B3-34, with fluorescent display
    and  priced at 85 roubles. It was another step forward!  It had a  stack
    based on four registers, 98 steps of program memory, 14 registers of memory instead of the
    seven available on the B3-21, and most importantly - the capability to organize cycles and
    work with index registers. It was a pleasure to work with this calculator.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Soon, in 1982, appeared its analogues, the B3-34 and MK-54,
    with fluorescent display and a more beautiful design, and costing on 20 roubles cheaper at
    the expense of using a  power supply of different type. The desktop variant 
    MK-56 was also developed.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">One behind another,  the most popular scientific and
    technical magazines, such as &#34;Science and Life&#34;, &#34;Engineering - youth&#34;
    and &#34;Chemistry and Life,&#34; started to teach how to work with the
    calculator.  &#34;Science and Life&#34;, started in October 1983 a special section
    named &#34;Man with the calculator&#34;, talking about how to work with the B3-34, and
    including plenty of useful and game programs. The magazine &#34;Engineering -
    Youth&#34;, beginning in 1985 included a column on programming the B3-34 under the name
    &#34;The Calculator - your assistant&#34; <img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/Ip.jpg" alt="The True Truth" width="170" height="88"/>, and then organized the &#34;Club of Electronic
    Games&#34;, which printed the most fascinating and fantastic stories: &#34;The True
    Truth&#34; and &#34;Way to the Earth&#34;, here the readers were given the
    chance &#34;to run into&#34; the engineering of &#34;landing&#34; on a lunar
    surface and carry out a flight back from the Moon to the Earth by a ship, not adapted
    to such lunar flights, called the &#34;Kon-Tiki&#34;.  School kids and adult
    calculator users waited with impatience the next number of &#34;Engineering - Youth&#34;
    to continue their flight back to the Earth...</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">This calculator worked under the Reverse Polish Notation
    system, therefore, after entering the  first number, the <img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B-strel.jpg" alt="ENTER" width="30" height="27"/> key  is pressed, then the second number is
    entered and the corresponding operator key is pressed. For example, to multiply 2 by 3, it
    was necessary to press the keys: <img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B-2.jpg" alt="2 Key" width="30" height="27"/> <img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B-strel.jpg" alt="B-strel.jpg (742 bytes)" width="30" height="27"/> <img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B-3.jpg" alt="3 Key" width="30" height="27"/> <img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B-mul.jpg" alt="Multiply" width="30" height="27"/> (result - 6).  A stack
    consisting of four registers - X, Y, Z, T was used to store the operands. To enter a
    number after obtaining a result and to recall a number from one the memory 
    registers  (0.. 9, A.. D), the content of the X register, which is the display
    register, had to be moved to the Y register, causing Y to move to Z, and Z to T.  
    Registers X and Y were used for most operations requiring operands. </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">In programming mode the code for each command takes one
    cell of memory. Branching commands  (transfers, loops, conditional transfers) take
    two cells. One cell for the operation code , and a second for the transfer address. In
    contrast with the  B3-21, the transfer address  can now be entered directly,
    instead of finding the correspondent operation code in a table. For example, to enter a
    transfer command to address 33 with the B3-21 it was necessary to enter [BP] [3]
    (the  3 key corresponded to code 34), in the B3-34 calculator it was only necessary
    to enter [BP] [3] [3].  Although now one more keystroke is required,  it is no
    longer necessary to look for the operation code in a table.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">More details on how to work with the  B3-34
    calculator, are described on the special page devoted to the use of the  B3-34
    located <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/1061/b334doce.htm">here</a>.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">However, the most interesting aspect of the B3-34
    calculator and its analogues is the availability of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/1061/b334e.htm">undocumented features</a>. 
    These were useful  not only to write programs, but also to build special display
    messages. There are so many undocumented features  that they could deserve writing an
    additional article. </SPAN></p>
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/Mk5261.jpg" alt="Elektronika MK-61 (left), MK-52 (right)" width="200" height="128"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The  B3-34
    calculator and its analogues, the MK-54 and the   desktop MK-56, became so popular,
    that the developers from the &#34;Crystal&#34; Kiev factory  decided to continue
    this line.  In  1985 the new models MK-61 and MK-52 were introduced. They had
    one more memory  register,  5 programs of 97 steps each, and ten additional
    functions. In addition, the MK-52 calculator  had   512 bytes of permanent
    memory, which was not erased when the  power was disconnected.  This memory was
    able to store both programs and data. The  MK-52 calculator also had special sockets
    for the connection of available program modules known as BRP (blocks of memory expansion).
    When designing the BRP blocks the developers again killed two rabbits at once by
    soldering in one block the matrix for two sets of  programs. By connecting a jumper,
    say, in rule 1,  one had the block BRP-3 with a mathematical set of the programs,
    then re-soldering the jumper to  rule 2 - the block became the BRP-2 with 
    astro-navigational functions. Of course, this implied to lose the manufacturer warranty
    since to do that it was necessary to remove a sealed screw. This was divulged in one of
    the issues of  &#34;Science and Life&#34; magazine by a reader who in turn was
    told by one of the &#34;Crystal&#34; developers. I can imagine what would happen to this
    developer.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">By the way, the MK-52 flew to the space in the &#34;Soyuz
    TM-7&#34;, where it was supposed to compute the landing trajectory in case the
    onboard computer would fail.</SPAN></p>
    <hr/>
    <p><SPAN face="Arial" size="3"><strong>Late models of calculators</strong></SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Early calculators consumed a lot of energy from its
    batteries, providing a maximum of two hours of independent work. 220 volts were not always
    available,  and replacement batteries where only  available in large cities.
    Therefore, engineers and developers began to develop calculators with less power
    requirements. By that time, displays based on liquid crystals with low power consumption
    had already been invented.</SPAN></p>
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B330.jpg" alt="Elektronika B3-30" width="120" height="197"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The B3-30 (shown at the left) became the second calculator based on
    liquid crystals after the B3-04. Developed in 1978 and consuming only 8 mW (for
    comparison, the  B3-26 calculator consumed 600 mW),  this calculator had a
    function, unusual for Soviet calculators, to return the inverse of a number. This function
    is now available practically in all modern simple calculators. To calculate 1/5, the
    following sequence was used: [5] [-:-] [=]. In 1979, the  B3-30 calculator was
    replaced by the B3-39 model, in which the microchip used a new low-level logic. The
    power consumption was decreased by eight times to only one mW. This allowed to build this
    calculator without a voltage converter.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">One year after, for the Moscow Olympiads of 1980, the 
    MK-53 calculator was manufactured with an onboard watch,  an alarm clock, and a stop
    watch. This calculator  required one less battery than the B3-39. This became
    possible at the expense of using an even lower level microcircuit, the K145VV3-2, which
    was considered to be &#34;Bodiless&#34;.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">A new milestone in the development of calculators was the
    MK-60 which was powered by a solar cell. In general, this was a simple calculator with one
    memory register, nothing special except for the  solar batteries.</SPAN></p>
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B338.jpg" alt="Elektronika B3-38" width="170" height="135"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">The creativity of the engineers didn&#39;t rest, and deciding that
    miniaturization was important, they developed in 1979 a new super-small, but very
    clever calculator, the B3-38. It included all the last achievements of micro-electronics.
    Its dimensions were the smallest available at the time - 91 x 55 x 5.5 mm. It was
    able  to perform not only scientific, but also statistical calculations. This
    calculator had two prefix keys - F1 and F2. </SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">A similar calculator was introduced in 1982, but with
    larger size, the MK-51. Soon it became very popular, although it had a basic defect - the
    worst power switch ever made. Engineers had decided to include a mechanism consisting
    of a semicircular toddler, which closed the contacts on a wiring attached directly 
    to the printed circuit board. Certainly, with the pass of time the contact points got
    rusted and became defective.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">These calculators used for the first time the &#34;digit
    by digit&#34; (CORDIC) method for the calculation of transcendental functions which has
    replaced the Taylor finite-series approximations of a number. CORDIC was the standard in
    almost all modern calculators all over the world, except at the USSR. In two words,
    the &#34;digit by digit&#34; method allows to calculate an attribute by iteration
    and tabulation. It is characterized by the simplicity in the execution of operations
    (algebraic addition and shift),  the significant similarity of the algorithms
    applied for various functions and, most importantly, for the high speed and accuracy of
    the calculations. The margin of error in calculations for an 8-digit argument was at most
    +/ - 1 in the seventh or eighth digit.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Finally, one of the latest models among engineering
    calculators was the  MK-71 standard calculator powered by solar components. As a
    matter of fact, it was a continuation of the series B3-38 and MK-51. As opposed to the
    B3-38 and MK-51 models,  this calculator, as well as the C3-15,  used an
    algebraic logic with five levels of brackets for calculations.  It also  worked
    with simple fractions, and could display the results in degrees, minutes and
    seconds.  It had hyperbolic functions,  and a mechanism to round-off the result
    to a required accuracy. In addition, it was a ten-digit calculator.</SPAN></p>
    <p><img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/Democalc.jpg" alt="Demonstration Calculator" width="150" height="156"/><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">There is one more direction in the development of
    calculators - the demonstration calculators. As a matter of fact, these were normal
    calculators wired to large displays and magnetic buttons. A hand magnetic pointer was used
    to activate the keys. I only have one photo of the demonstration calculator made on the
    basis of the MK-36. On one occasion I attended a demonstration in my school with a
    calculator compatible with the MK-54 measuring 1.5 meters, but by the end of August it had
    been thrown out on the rubbish dump...</SPAN></p></td>

    <p><strong><SPAN face="Arial" size="3">Calculators bugs and features</SPAN></strong></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">This section is a brief review on errors and special
    features of Soviet calculators. Taking into account the special circumstances of the
    development of Soviet calculators, including the geopolitical aspects, it becomes clear
    that if Soviet engineers developed the calculators not basing the design on a
    level-by-level scanning of the microcircuits of their imported analogues, they were
    constantly introducing some highlights into their work. There were either errors in the
    calculations performed by the calculators or interesting discoveries.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">As an example, the family of calculators belonging to
    series B3-26 (B3-23, B3-24G, MK-57), indicated the availability of a number in the memory
    register by displaying a dot in the leftmost display position. On the other hand, this
    calculator perfectly calculated square roots for negative numbers. The square root of -4
    was reported as -2,  and no error messages were displayed.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">In the B3-32 calculator, when the developers realized that
    there was a dot at the left of the display which was not involved in any operation, they
    decided to involve it. In this model this dot lights up while a key is pressed and turns
    off when it is released. Any more problems to solve?.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">In the calculators of the B3-35 family (B3-36, MK-66,
    MK-45) although the developers implemented the calculation of a factorial by an ordering
    method (1 * 2 * 3 * ...), they  forgot to block the keyboard when an error message
    was displayed, so the user was able to continue the operations with the erroneous results.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">In the B3-21 calculator,  the developers included a
    function <img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B-eix.jpg" alt="e^x" width="30" height="16"/> which stored the sine of the argument in
    the Y register, and the cosine in the X register. Then, by simple division, the user could
    obtain the tangent. Very convenient. However, an error was detected on the first series of
    these calculators: when adding a number containing seven nines in the mantissa and a nine
    in the eighth digit, which is not displayed - to a number larger than four,  an error
    occurs. for example, adding 9.9999999 to 10 yields 120.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">When executing complex operations like getting the sine of
    of a number, one of the registers in the circular stack could be trashed. To check if a
    calculator has this problem, enter [2] [P] [sin] [P] [,]. If the display shows 1. -00,
    then the calculator has the bug.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">In addition, some models perform incorrect jumps to the
    subroutine if a PP operator is entered into a cell of program memory with address 55, 65,
    70, 80, 91 or 92, and an operator with a code equal to the subroutine transfer index is
    executed . This is a little difficult to understand, but if address 55 contains the
    symbols | PP | 9 | 9 | S/P |, instead of jumping to address 93 (code for key | 9 | - 94),
    the calculator fills the register X with the number 99. This could easily cause
    bewilderment and a nervous breakdown to the programmer, who was sure that the program has
    been written correctly.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">Curious users can find in the MK-71 calculator a very
    remarkable feature. The switch for &#34;grades-radians-degrees&#34; falls easily  
    into an intermediate position - between degrees and radians, or between radians and
    grades. Who had hit upon this idea before? At this point, the calculator turns into a very
    unusual mode of calculations reminding the operation of the MK-51 calculator. First, now
    the numbers in the microprocessor have a mantissa of length 8 instead of ten, the missing
    digits are still kept in memory but are no longer visible to the user. Secondly, some
    function keys have a different functionality! The key showing degrees now calculate the
    1/x function when used with the factorial function &#34;F&#34;. The 1/x key - switches
    the method of calculation of trigonometric functions (degrees - radians - grades). The
    display, however, still shows the corresponding &#34;F&#34;, &#34;P&#34;,
    &#34;K&#34; icons! If the &#34;F&#34; key is combined with the 1/x key the calculator
    mode passes to statistical calculations. The &#34;hyp&#34; key now process the
    information in degrees, minutes and seconds, and goes back to its normal mode if the
    &#34;F&#34; key is pressed.  Segments of the leftmost positions in the display are
    used  to indicate that a number is stored into the &#34;P&#34; memory, or the
    inverse (shift, 2nd) mode &#34;F&#34; is active,  or a constant &#34;K&#34; is
    being applied to the calculations.</SPAN></p>
    <p><SPAN size="2" face="Arial">And now, the B3-34, the most common calculator in Russia.
    This calculator has plenty of errors and operational features. Only some of them will be
    described, the ones that once were mentioned in a book as being features  &#34;...
    are a consequence not of errors made by the developers of the microprocessor, but of their
    attempts to find a compromise between the software requests and simplicity of the design.
    &#34; When executing operations under a programmed mode,  the functional operators
    preceding the /-/ operator default to a sign change. After some operators transfer the
    control to the end of a subroutine, instead of returning the control to the V/O operator,
    the next operator is executed. Here such &#34;feature&#34;. The operator X^Y was
    executed incorrectly in order to keep significant figures in the operands. For example it
    is possible to enter [5] [5] [5] [5]  <img src="https://xnumber.com/xnumber/Russian/B-strel.jpg" alt="ENTER" width="30" height="27"/> [X]
    [4] [F] [X^Y]. If 39.062487 is displayed, the operator X^Y is calculated incorrectly.
    These errors were corrected subsequently, but there were errors on building negative
    integer numbers, the MK-61 and MK-52  calculators chose zero as the largest value
    when the function to evaluate the maximum of two numbers [K][max] were used. Take my word,
    &#34;we have&#34; tried.</SPAN></p>
