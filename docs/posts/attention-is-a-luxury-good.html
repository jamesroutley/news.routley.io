    <h1>Attention is a luxury good</h1>

<p>Luxury goods are special: they are scarce and expensive, and they earn us status with some folks because it shows that we paid more than we needed to.</p>



<p>Luxury isn’t about quality, suitability or performance. Luxury isn’t a more accurate watch or a faster processor. Luxury is a marker that we can afford to do something others might consider wasteful.</p>



<p>A Birkin bag is a luxury good, and so is reading an entire non-fiction book, listening to a public radio broadcast or attending a concert when we could stay at home and listen for free.</p>



<p>By ‘wasting’ our attention on nuance, narrative, experiences and everything except the checkbox takeaway, we’re sending a message to ourselves and others. A message about allocating our time to something beyond optimized performance or survival.</p>



<p>If you’ve signed up to offer an attention-luxury good, you undermine it when you also try to make it quick and convenient.</p>
