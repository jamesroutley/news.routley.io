    <h1>Douglas Hofstadter changes his mind on Deep Learning and AI risk</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="block17">
<p id="block18"><strong>D. Hofstadter</strong>: When I started out studying cognitive science
and thinking about the mind and computation, you know, this was
many years ago, around 1960, and I knew how computers worked and
I knew how extraordinarily rigid they were. You made the
slightest typing error and it completely ruined your program.
Debugging was a very difficult art and you might have to run
your program many times in order to just get the bugs out. And
then when it ran, it would be very rigid and it might not do
exactly what you wanted it to do because you hadn&#39;t told it
exactly what you wanted to do correctly, and you had to change
your program, and on and on.</p>
<p id="block19">Computers were very rigid and I grew up with a certain feeling
about what computers can or cannot do. And I thought that
artificial intelligence, when I heard about it, was a very
fascinating goal, which is to make rigid systems act fluid. But
to me, that was a very long, remote goal. It seemed infinitely
far away. It felt as if artificial intelligence was the art of
trying to make very rigid systems behave as if they were fluid.
And I felt that would take enormous amounts of time. I felt it
would be hundreds of years before anything even remotely like a
human mind would be asymptotically approaching the level of the
human mind, but from beneath.</p>
<p id="block20">I never imagined that computers would rival, let alone surpass,
human intelligence. And in principle, I thought they could rival
human intelligence. I didn&#39;t see any reason that they couldn&#39;t.
But it seemed to me like it was a goal that was so far away, I
wasn&#39;t worried about it. But when certain systems started
appearing, maybe 20 years ago, they gave me pause. And then this
started happening at an accelerating pace, where unreachable
goals and things that computers shouldn&#39;t be able to do started
toppling. The defeat of Gary Kasparov by Deep Blue, and then
going on to Go systems, Go programs, well, systems that could
defeat some of the best Go players in the world. And then
systems got better and better at translation between languages,
and then at producing intelligible responses to difficult
questions in natural language, and even writing poetry.</p>
<p id="block21">And my whole intellectual edifice, my system of beliefs... It&#39;s
a very traumatic experience when some of your most core beliefs
about the world start collapsing. And especially when you think
that human beings are soon going to be eclipsed. It felt as if
not only are my belief systems collapsing, but it feels as if
the entire human race is going to be eclipsed and left in the
dust soon. People ask me, &#34;What do you mean by &#39;soon&#39;?&#34; And I
don&#39;t know what I really mean. I don&#39;t have any way of knowing.
But some part of me says 5 years, some part of me says 20 years,
some part of me says, &#34;I don&#39;t know, I have no idea.&#34; But the
progress, the accelerating progress, has been so unexpected, so
completely caught me off guard, not only myself but many, many
people, that there is a certain kind of terror of an oncoming
tsunami that is going to catch all humanity off guard.</p>
<p id="block22">It&#39;s not clear whether that will mean the end of humanity in the
sense of the systems we&#39;ve created destroying us. It&#39;s not clear
if that&#39;s the case, but it&#39;s certainly conceivable. If not, it
also just renders humanity a very small phenomenon compared to
something else that is far more intelligent and will become
incomprehensible to us, as incomprehensible to us as we are to
cockroaches.</p>
