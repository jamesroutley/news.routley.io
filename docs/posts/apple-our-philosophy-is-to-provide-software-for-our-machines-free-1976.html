                  Apple Computer. A truly complete microcomputer system on a single 
                  PC board. Based on the MOS Technology 6502 micro- processor, 
                  the Apple also has a built-in video terminal and sockets for 
                  8K bytes of onboard RAM memory. With the addition of a keyboard 
                  and video monitor, you&#39;ll have an extremely powerful computer 
                  system that can be used for anything from developing programs 
                  to playing games or running BASIC.</SPAN></p>

                  </SPAN></b><SPAN color="#000000">Using the built-in video terminal 
                  and keyboard interface, you avoid all the expense, noise and 
                  mantenance associated with a teletype. And the Apple video terminal 
                  is six times faster than a teletype, which means more throughput 
                  and less waiting. The Apple connects directly to a video monitor 
                  (or home TV with an in- expensive RF modulator) and dis- plays 
                  960 easy to read characters in 24 rows of 40 characters per 
                  line with automatic scrolling. The video display section contains 
                  its own 1K bytes of memory, so all the RAM memory is available 
                  for user programs. And the</SPAN>

                  any ASCII-encoded keyboard.</SPAN></p>
                <p><b><SPAN color="#000000">No More Switches,</SPAN></b><SPAN color="#000000">   Compared 
                  to switches and LED&#39;s, a video terminal can dis- play vast amounts 
                  of information simultaneously. The Apple video terminal can 
                  display the contents of 192 memory locations at once on the 
                  screen. And the fimrware in PROMS enables you to enter,display 
                  and debug programs (all in hex) from the keyboard, ren- dering 
                  a front panel unnecessary. The firmware also allows your programs 
                  to print characters on the display, and since you&#39;ll be looking 
                  at letters and numbers instead of just LED&#39;s, the door is open 
                  to all kinds of alphanumeric software (i.e., Games and BASIC).</SPAN></p>

                  2&#34; tall.And since it is very fast (1500 bits per second), 
                  you can read or write 4 K bytes in about 20 seconds.All timing 
                  is done in software, witch results in crystal-controlled accuracy 
                  and uniformity from unit to unit.</SPAN></p>

                  in a highter level language immediately and without added cost.Also 
                  avialable now are a dis-assembler and many games, with many 
                  software packages,(including a macro assembler) in the works.And 
                  since our philosophy is to provide software for our machines 
                  free or at minimal cost, you won&#39;t be continually paying for 
                  access to this growing software library.</SPAN>
