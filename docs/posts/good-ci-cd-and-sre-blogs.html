    <h1>Good CI/CD and SRE Blogs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Are there any good blogs that focus on CI/CD pipelines and SRE without a ton of fluff?<p>I feel like the space moves fast, and I need a way to keep up with it better. In an ideal world I would want to see best practices for different tools, and pipelines so I can evaluate them and adopt what makes sense.</p></div></div>
