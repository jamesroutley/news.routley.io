    <h1>Planet Money: No Shortages of Labor Stories</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div><div><p>With the effects of the Great Resignation currently playing out in our economy, I really appreciated how this Planet Money <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/17/1065332194/no-shortage-of-labor-stories" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">episode</a> attempted to shine a light on some of the root causes. For one, the episode proposed an alternate name for what the economy has been experiencing: the Great Re-negotiation (I’ll be using this moniker going forward). It better reflects the conversations that have been going on between workers and employers. The Great Resignation puts all of the onus on workers, framing employers as blameless, but in reality both sides have grievances to air.</p><p>The pandemic really forced people to re-evaluate what they value and how much they’re willing to put up with when it comes to their day jobs. With demand for service jobs coming back, many folks realized that the horrendous hours, low pay, and lack of dignity just wasn’t worth it to them. One aspect that a lot of the coverage of the Great Re-negotiation doesn’t talk very much about is the fact that many of those people who are opting to not return to service jobs have been spending their quarantine time working on changing careers. </p><p>There are also many folks who choose to subsist off of their savings; to take a long sabbatical from work. I have a sense of admiration for those in this position; they have truly internalized the notion that money is merely a tool for living, instead of an end in and of itself. I’ve had a fear of unemployment all throughout my career. More specifically, the thought of spending more money than I’m earning; the bathtub can’t be draining faster than the faucet is refilling it. Yet I abhor this phobia of mine. I’m slowly making my way towards a point where I feel mentally, emotionally, and spiritually ok with the bathtub draining faster than the faucet. </p><p>Apart from proposing a better name for what our economy is current going through, this episode also interviewed a co-founder of a small software firm that responded to the Great Re-negotiation by enacting a salary reset: they gave all of their employees the freedom to choose their own salary (though everyone had to justify their respective numbers). This new policy had the effect of greatly improving the overall standards of work, as well as also re-aligning the company’s culture. </p><p>From the employees’ perspective, they were each empowered to work as much as they wanted. That trust had the effect of imbuing all of the firm’s workers with something akin to a founder’s mindset, according to the co-founder who was interviewed. As a result, everyone felt much more of a personal stake in the outcome of what they were building; every employee was driven to make it as good as they possibly could, as a direct response to the high amount of trust they were each afforded. </p><p>I really love this anecdote, as it perfectly aligns with the qualities that make a good manager: the co-founders decided to trust their employees and gave them full reign to each express and implement their own ideas. The whole company became better for it, at the cost of the co-founders’ bottom line (which I think is an entirely worthy tradeoff). </p><p>As of this writing, I work at a workers’ co-op. One thing that I found a bit odd about the hiring process though is that they handle workers’ salaries in the same way as a traditional company, where a new hire’s salary is set based off of some internal salary spreadsheet. Wouldn’t it make more sense to go through a process where the new hire proposes and justifies their own salary? This would empower all workers to put their best foot forward in their work and imbue everyone with a founder’s mindset, which to me seems like exactly what every worker co-op would want to strive for. </p><p>Perhaps I’ll float the idea at work.</p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
