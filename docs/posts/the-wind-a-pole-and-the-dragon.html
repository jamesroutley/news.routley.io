    <h1>The Wind, a Pole, and the Dragon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>
One of my favourite requests for help online comes from the shibboleth-users
group, where <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/shibboleth-users/c/EjvS2Cgio6c/m/m0f69QgXWQAJ">someone Japanese used machine translation to ask about the
following problem</a>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
At often, the goat-time install a error is vomit. To how many times like
the wind, a pole, and the dragon? Install 2,3 repeat, spank, vomit blows
</p>

<pre id="orgf450897">14:14:01.869 - INFO
[edu.internet2.middleware.shibboleth.common.config.profile.JSPErrorHandlerBeanDefinitionParser:45]
Parsing configuration for JSP error handler.
</pre>

<p>
Not precise the vomit but with aspect similar, is vomited concealed in fold of
goat-time lumber? goat-time see like the wind, pole, and dragon? This
insult to father’s stones? JSP error handler with wind, pole, dragon with
intercourse to goat-time? Or chance lack of skill with a goat-time?
</p>

<p>
Please apologize for your stupidity. There are a many thank you
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I have long wanted to figure out exactly how this went so wrong. Some parts are
fairly clear:
</p>

<ul>
<li><i>vomit</i> could come from <i>throw</i> (as in throwing an error) or even just
<i>output</i>.</li>
<li><i>lumber</i> must clearly reference <i>logs</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I have also heard speculation that <i>goat-time</i> means <i>runtime</i>, as in the Java
runtime, perhaps. This means we can already figure out how we got to “vomited
concealed in fold of goat-time lumber” – it’s an error hidden in the runtime
logs.
</p>

<p>
I asked a few <abbr>llm</abbr>s to assist me with the rest, and they universally think
<i>spank</i> is an odd translation of <i>hit</i>, which is apparently used in Japanese to
mean something like <i>execute</i>, and <i>skill</i> could be a mistranslation of
<i>experience</i>.
</p>

<p>
We can start to put together what the message actually means.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Often when trying to install the runtime an error is thrown. <abbr>uninterpretable</abbr> I
have tried reinstalling it three times, but when I run it an exception is thrown.
</p>

<p>
This is not the exact exception but something like that. Is the real error
hidden in the runtime logs? <abbr>uninterpretable</abbr>. <abbr>uninterpretable</abbr> arising due to
interaction with the runtime? Or perhaps my lack of experience with the runtime?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <abbr>llm</abbr>s diverge on the meaning of “insult to father’s stones”. Some suggest
the obvious thing, that it’d correspond to an idiomatic expression of
frustration. Others seem to think it might be about “problems with the ancestral
building blocks”, i.e. software dependencies. I liked that reading, but I have
no idea.
</p>



<p>
Then there’s “the wind, a pole, and the dragon.” I have yet to see anything come
close to a reasonable answer. <abbr>llm</abbr>s produce guesses referring to three parts of
the configuration, variable names, dependencies, colloquialisms, descriptions of
user interface, or abstract descriptions of how quickly things happen (the
wind), a fixed point (a pole), and complexity/power (dragon). But again, I have
no idea.
