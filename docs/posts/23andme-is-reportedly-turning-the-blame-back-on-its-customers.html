He and 23andMe did not respond to Business Insider&#39;s requests for comment.</p><p>Following the breach, the company asked all its users to reset their passwords and set up additional security measures like two-factor authentication, <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.23andme.com/articles/addressing-data-security-concerns" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"><u>according</u></a> to its website. It also noted that it now requires all new and existing customers to log in to their accounts using two-step verification.</p><p>In October, the company said the results of its preliminary investigation showed no indication of a data security incident within its systems. The company has reiterated that through the investigation. </p>
