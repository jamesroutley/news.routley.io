To put it simply, it leaves a very easy to find log with details about the user. With Windows you can read the user&#39;s service login and make new connections with it, thus hijacking the user&#39;s account for VPN usage. This goes for Manual IKEv2 and OpenVPN connections. </p><p>All it takes is an unattended machine for someone to boot another os on and grab the file or take it via a remote access trojan.</p><p>Oh, and it&#39;s also visible to all users.

It seems no one wants to admit just how much they&#39;re being paid to promote these VPNs. </p><p>So let&#39;s napkin math this bad boy. We&#39;ll go with NordVPN, seeing as they have one of the most aggressive affiliate programs worldwide. </p><p>A single sale of their popular 2-year plan nets an affiliate site $28.73 per conversion. <a href="https://www.awin.com/us/how-to-use-awin/how-to-use-affiliate-marketing-to-drive-low-cost-conversions-for-your-brand#:~:text=As%20a%20general%20guideline%2C%20conversion,to%201%25%20are%20considered%20average.&amp;text=As%20mentioned%20earlier%2C%20in%20affiliate,on%20the%20affiliate%20links%20increase.">The industry average for conversion rates for an affiliate site is around 0.5% - 1.0%</a>. Nord hints at a much higher one in their marketing materials, but we&#39;ll use 0.5% for now.  </p><p>If we look at a popular affiliate site that runs multiple affiliates like Kape Technologies&#39; Safety Detectives, which has 3.1M hits a month, we can guestimate a rough payout. </p><p><strong><em>0.5% of 3.1M is 15500 				</em></strong></p><p>We should account for the fact that a lot of their users may be visiting for informational purposes and not for commercial ones. Their bounce rate on SimilarWeb suggests that 73.86% of visitors visit one page before leaving. Let&#39;s say they&#39;re not buying (even though they are potentially converting off a single landing page).</p><p> 73.86% of 3,100,000 = 2,289,660. That leaves us with 810,340 visitors who at least check another page before leaving.</p><p><strong>0.5% of 810, 340 = 4052				</strong></p><h3 id="3-nordvpn-potential-class-action-lawsuit">#3 NordVPN potential class-action lawsuit</h3><p>NordVPN is currently facing a potential class-action lawsuit by Wittels McInturff Palikovic.

Articles utilise fluffy criteria or move the goalposts to ensure the affiliates are never poorly reflected upon. The entire article is often designed to create conversions for their affiliates. </p><p>Reviewers frequently compare the latest affiliate build to an outdated (or defunct) non-affiliate build from several years ago. Non-affiliate listings often lack detail, or correct information.  </p><p><em>*Not a single source found for the links between affiliates showcased a non-affiliate as a better option. Even in areas where the non-affiliate has been proven to be a superior option such as successful real-world tests, lack of breaches, etc. Go through the map and go through each affiliate node, I&#39;ll wait.

As of May 2022 VPNs are estimated to be a $44.6B industry and are predicted to break $77B within 4 years*. <em>Mental</em>.</p><p>To the surprise of absolutely no one, totalitarian governments and censors just can&#39;t help themselves. It is in their nature to snoop and spy. To do a little thought-policing. To surveil the state and whatnot. A direct result of the actions of these dickhead dictators, shows demand for security and safety is ever rising - but the real sad part is it appears the majority of people who then seek a VPN are being duped by shady marketing tactics.</p><p>There&#39;s certainly a very expensive battle going on right now, but our mindset isn&#39;t exactly the status quo. We&#39;ve said this before and we&#39;ll say it again. <a href="https://windscribe.com/blog/were-not-paying-for-one/">We won&#39;t pay for the #1 spot</a>. </p><p>These corporate VPNs are spending millions all in the hopes of squashing independents like us and taking control of the market, and they aren&#39;t afraid to use whatever tactics yield results, ethics be damned. </p><p>*<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/542817/worldwide-virtual-private-network-market/">Source</a></p><h3 id="contributors">CONTRIBUTORS</h3><hr/><p><em>Contributors must prove the accuracy of their claims by providing a source that can prove their statements.
