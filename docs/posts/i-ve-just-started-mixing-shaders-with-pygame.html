I don&#39;t think the music entirely matched, but it still worked.¬†</p>
<p>As for the gameplay, I think the wall jumps are a little un-controllable (just a little), and the respawn mechanics aren&#39;t flawless either.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t really time myself, but it took a good 25 minutes for me to figure¬†it all out (thanks for the puzzle!).</p>
<p>Overall, I really liked it. üëç</p></div></div></div></div><div id="post-7073051" data-post="{&#34;id&#34;:7073051,&#34;user_id&#34;:6881453}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/shad0w-57"></a><div><p>The music is pleasant to hear.</p></div></div></div><div id="post-7072971" data-post="{&#34;id&#34;:7072971,&#34;user_id&#34;:4920356}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/jadenhensley"></a><div><p>Really fun and meditative game. Beautiful aesthetic and calming music. I played this platformer for about 15 minutes and thoroughly explored what seemed to be all of the level, but I definitely enjoyed it. There seems to be no win condition and there are a lot of vertical areas that seems like they should expand the map upward but you cannot go upwards. Those are my only critiques of the game. This game is very successful at immersion.</p></div></div></div><div><div id="post-7073038" data-post="{&#34;id&#34;:7073038,&#34;user_id&#34;:242479}"><div><a href="https://itch.io/profile/dafluffypotato"></a><div><p>Completing the game is a bit of a puzzle.
