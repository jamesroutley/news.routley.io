    <h1>OpenEarable: A new, open-source, Arduino-based platform for ear-based sensing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>OpenEarable is a new, open-source, Arduino-based platform for ear-based sensing applications.</span><span>It supports a series of sensors and actuators: a 9-axis inertial measurement unit, an ear canal pressure and temperature sensor, an inward facing ultrasound microphone as well as a speaker, a push button, and a controllable LED. We demonstrate the versatility of the prototyping platform through a series of example application scenarios. As such, OpenEarable offers a general-purpose, open sensing platform for earable research and development.</span></p><div><p>Developers</p><div><p><img src="https://open-earable.teco.edu/KIT_Logo_final.png"/></p><p><img src="https://open-earable.teco.edu/teco_logo.png"/></p></div></div><p><img/></p></div></div></div>
