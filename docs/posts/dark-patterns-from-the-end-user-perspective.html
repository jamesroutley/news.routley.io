      <span>Abstract:</span>  Online services pervasively employ manipulative designs (i.e., dark patterns)
to influence users to purchase goods and subscriptions, spend more time
on-site, or mindlessly accept the harvesting of their personal data. To protect
users from the lure of such designs, we asked: are users aware of the presence
of dark patterns? If so, are they able to resist them? By surveying 406
individuals, we found that they are generally aware of the influence that
manipulative designs can exert on their online behaviour. However, being aware
does not equip users with the ability to oppose such influence. We further find
that respondents, especially younger ones, often recognise the &#34;darkness&#34; of
certain designs, but remain unsure of the actual harm they may suffer. Finally,
we discuss a set of interventions (e.g., bright patterns, design frictions,
training games, applications to expedite legal enforcement) in the light of our
findings.
