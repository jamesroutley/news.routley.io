    <p>A few weeks ago, I was building a server-side API client. I had written the code and tested it in isolation. Everything looked good. Unfortunately, when I included it in the main service, I started seeing errors.</p>

<p>I decided to try asking an AI tool for suggestions. I gave it the error message and a bunch of context. It gave me a solution with a detailed explanation. The errors went away.</p>

<p>But the solution didn’t sit right with me. It was a bit complex, introducing more layers of code and various protections. The errors were gone, but I couldn’t clearly explain <em>why</em> it worked, and that was bothering me.</p>

<p>While the code was being reviewed, I decided to take another look. I brought back the error and spent some time digging into the stack trace. That’s when I made the discovery: it was an environment issue. All I needed to do was set an environment variable and the issue would be fixed. The AI-provided code had been masking the <em>real</em> issue, quietly suppressing the error, and hiding the truth in its complexity.</p>

<p>Now this is the part of the post where I’m supposed to criticize AI programming tools. I won’t be doing that. This isn’t an AI problem.</p>

<p>I remember the first time I tried to fix a memory leak. Certain iPhone users would load the webpage, interact for a while, and then randomly the webpage would crash. We struggled to diagnose the issue (Safari’s devtools weren’t great at the time). We <em>thought</em> we fixed it several times but the issue kept coming back.</p>

<p>Why? Because we didn’t understand the problem.</p>

<p>We kept digging and eventually we found it: one of our dependencies was storing massive amounts of data on the <code>window</code> object and it wasn’t getting cleaned up. We added a cleanup step and the problem was gone for good.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve adopted a mantra: <strong>you can’t fix a problem you don’t understand</strong>.</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if the “fix” comes from AI, Stack Overflow, or trial-and-error. If I don’t understand the problem, I feel unsettled until I do.</p>
