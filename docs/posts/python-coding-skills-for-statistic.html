    <h1>Python coding skills for statistic</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1852">

		<p>Learning statistics is greatly facilitated by using a computational platform for doing statistics calculations and visualizations. You can do basic stats calculations using pen-and-paper for small datasets, but you’ll need a computer to help you with larger datasets. Common computational platforms for doing statistics include <a href="https://jasp-stats.org/">JASP</a>, <a href="https://www.jamovi.org/">jamovi</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/spss">SPSS</a>, <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, and <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, among many others. You can even do statistics calculations using spreadsheet software like Excel, <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> calc, or <a href="https://sheets.new/">Google Sheets</a>. I believe using <strong>Python is the best computational platform for learning statistics</strong>. Specifically, an interactive notebook environment like JupyterLab provides the best-in-class tools for data visualizations and probability calculations.</p>
<p>But what about learners who are not familiar with Python? Should we abandon non-tech learners and say they can’t learn statistics because they don’t know how to use Python? Naaaah, we ain’t having none of that! Instead, my plan is to <strong>bring non-technical learners up to speed on Python</strong> by teaching them the Python basics that they need to use for statistics. Anyone can learn Python, it’s really not a big deal. I hope to convince you of this fact in this blog post, which is intended as a Python crash-course for the absolute beginner.</p>

<p>I know the prospect of learning Python might seem like a daunting task, but I assure you that it is totally worth it because Python will provide you with all the tools you need to handle the mathematical and procedural complexity inherent to statistics. Using Python will make your statistics learning journey much more intuitive (because of the interactivity) and practical (because of the useful tools). All the math equations we need to describe statistical concepts will become a lot easier to understand once you can express math concepts as Python code you can “play” with. Basically, what I’m saying is that if you accept Python in your heart, you’ll benefit from much reduced suffering on your journey of learning statistics.</p>
<p>This blog post is the first part in a three-part series about why <strong>learning PYTHON+STATS is the most efficient and painless way to learn statistics</strong>. In this post (PART 1 of 3), we’ll introduce the JupyterLab computational platform, show basic examples of Python commands, and introduce some useful libraries for doing data visualizations (Seaborn) and data manipulations (Pandas). The key point I want to convince you of, is that you don’t need to become a programmer to benefit from all the power of the Python ecosystem, <strong>you just need to learn how to use Python as a calculator</strong>.</p>

<h2><span id="interactive-notebook-learning-environments"></span>Interactive notebook learning environments<span></span></h2>
<p>One of the great things about learning Python is the interactivity. In an interactive coding environment, you can write some commands, run the commands, then immediately see the outputs. The immediate link between Python commands and their results makes it easy to try different inputs and make quick changes to the code based on the results you get.</p>
<p>A <strong>Jupyter notebook</strong> is a complete statistical computing environment that allows you to run Python code interactively, generate plots, run simulations, do probability calculations, all in the same place. All the code examples in this blog post were copy-pasted from the <a href="https://github.com/minireference/noBSstatsnotebooks/blob/main/blogposts/python_for_stats.ipynb">notebook</a> shown in Figure 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jupyterlab-screenshot.png"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="840" src="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jupyterlab-screenshot-1024x840.png" alt="" srcset="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jupyterlab-screenshot-1024x840.png 1024w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jupyterlab-screenshot-300x246.png 300w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jupyterlab-screenshot-768x630.png 768w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/jupyterlab-screenshot.png 1243w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></a></p>
<p>I’ve highlighted a few regions in the screenshot so that I can draw your attention to them and explain the “stack” of software that produced this screenshot. Region <strong>(1)</strong> is <strong>JupyterLab Desktop</strong>, which is an application you can download and install locally to run JupyterLab on your computer; region <strong>(2)</strong> is the <strong>JupyterLab</strong> software we use for running Jupyter notebooks; region <strong>(3)</strong> is a particular <strong>notebook</strong> called python_for_stats.ipynb (a document) that is currently opened for editing interactively; region <strong>(4)</strong> is an individual <strong>code cell</strong> that is part of the notebook.</p>
<p><strong>Each cell in a notebook acts like an “input prompt” for the Python calculator</strong>. For example, the code cell <strong>(4)</strong> in the screenshot shows the input expression <code>2.1 + 3.4</code> and the output of this expression <code>5.5</code> displayed below it. This is how all code cells work in a notebook: you type in some Python commands in the code cell, then press the play button (see <strong>(5)</strong> in the screenshot) in the menu bar or use the keyboard shortcut <strong>SHIFT+ENTER</strong>, then you’ll see the result of your Python commands shown on the next line.</p>

<h3><span id="running-jupyter-notebooks-interactively"></span>Running Jupyter notebooks interactively<span></span></h3>
<p>Since Python is a popular programming language used in many domains (education, software, data science, machine learning, etc.), people have developed multiple options for running Python code. Here are some of the ways you can run the Python code in the notebook python_for_stats.ipynb interactively.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JupyterLab</strong>: Use <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/minireference/noBSstatsnotebooks/main?labpath=blogposts/python_for_stats.ipynb">this link</a> (<a href="https://bit.ly/py4stats1">bit.ly/py4stats1</a>) to run the notebook python_for_stats.ipynb on a temporary JupyterLab server in the cloud. The servers are contributed by volunteer organizations (universities and web companies). This is my favorite option for running notebooks, since it doesn’t require installing anything on your computer.</li>
<li><strong>Colab</strong>: Use the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/minireference/noBSstatsnotebooks/blob/main/blogposts/python_for_stats.ipynb">colab link</a> to run python_for_stats.ipynb in a <a href="https://colab.google/">Google Colab</a> web environment.</li>
<li><strong>JupyterLab Desktop</strong>: Download and install the <a href="https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop#readme">JupyterLab Desktop</a> application on your computer. You can then right-click and choose “Save as” to save a copy of the file <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/minireference/noBSstatsnotebooks/main/blogposts/python_for_stats.ipynb">python_for_stats.ipynb</a> on your computer, then open it from within the JupyterLab Desktop application. (See Figure 1).</li>

</ul>
<p>I invite you to use one of the above methods to open the notebook python_for_stats.ipynb and try running the code examples interactively while reading the rest of the blog post.</p>
<h3><span id="why-is-interactivity-important"></span>Why is interactivity important?<span></span></h3>
<p>When learning a new skill, you’ll make a lot of mistakes. If you receive instant feedback about your actions, this makes it much easier to learn the new skill. Imagine having a private tutor looking over your shoulder, and telling you when you make mistakes. That would be nice, right?</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/divide-by-zero-exception.png" alt="" width="328" height="150" srcset="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/divide-by-zero-exception.png 560w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/divide-by-zero-exception-300x137.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px"/></p>
<p>Running Python interactively in a notebook environment offers precisely this experience. Whenever you input some Python command that contains an error, Python will tell you right away by printing an “error message.” The error message tells you what problem occurred and where it occurred (highlighted in yellow). For example, if you try to divide a number by zero, Python will respond with a big red message that tells you this is not possible to do. Like, mathematically impossible. What does dividing a quantity into 0 equal parts mean? If you try <code>3/0</code> on a calculator, it will also complain and show you an error message.</p>
<p>Reading a Python error message gives you hints about how to fix the input so it doesn’t cause an error. In this case there is no fix—just don’t be dividing by zero! This was just a simple example I used to show what an error looks like. Yes I know the red background is very intimidating, as if chastising you for having done something wrong! Once you get used to the “panic” coloring though, you’ll start to appreciate the helpful information that is provided in these error messages. This is just your friendly Python tutor telling you something in your input needs a fix.</p>
<p>Receiving error messages whenever you make mistakes is one of the main reasons why learning Python is so easy. You don’t need to read a lengthy book about Python programming, you can get started by opening a Jupyter notebook and trying some commands to see what happens. The interactive feedback of notebook environments helps many people get into a <a href="https://minireference.com/blog/learning-loops/">learning loop</a> that motivates them to learn more and more.</p>
<h2><span id="what-can-python-do-for-you"></span>What can Python do for you?<span></span></h2>
<p>Python is the #1 most popular language according to the <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE programming language popularity index</a>. Did this happen by chance, or is there something special about Python? Why do people like Python so much? Let’s find out.</p>
<h3><span id="using-python-as-a-calculator"></span>Using Python as a calculator<span></span></h3>
<p><strong>Python is like the best calculator ever!</strong> You can use Python for any arithmetic calculation you might want to do. Each cell in a Jupyter notebook is like the input prompt of a calculator, so if you wanted to add two numbers, you would do it like this:</p>
<pre> In[1]: 2.1 + 3.4
Out[1]: 5.5
</pre>
<p>All the sections in fixed-width font in this blog post contain Python code. Don’t worry if you haven’t seen code before, I’ll make sure to explain what each code block does in the surrounding text so you’ll know what’s going on. In the above code example, the first line <code>In[1]</code> shows the input expression we asked Python to compute, and the line <code>Out[1]</code> shows the output of this expression—the result that Python computed for us. This Python code example is equivalent to entering the number <code>2.1</code> on a calculator, followed by pressing the <code>+</code> button, then entering <code>3.4</code>, and finally pressing the <code>=</code> button. Just like a calculator, Python computed the value of the input expression <code>2.1+3.4</code> and printed the output <code>5.5</code> on the next line.</p>
<p>Instead of working with numbers directly, we can store numbers into variables and specify the arithmetic operation in terms of these variables.</p>
<pre> In[2]: num1 = 2.1
 In[3]: num2 = 3.4
 In[4]: num1 + num2
Out[4]: 5.5
</pre>
<p>The effect of the input line <code>In[2]</code> is to store the number <code>2.1</code> into the new variable named <code>num1</code>. This is called an assignment statement in Python, and it is read from right-to-left: “store <code>2.1</code> into <code>num1</code>“. Assignment statements don’t have any outputs, so this is why there is no <code>Out[2]</code> to show. The input <code>In[3]</code> stores <code>3.4</code> into the variable <code>num2</code>, and again there is no output to display, since this is another assignment statement. The input <code>In[4]</code> asks Python to compute the value of the expression <code>num1 + num2</code>, that is, the sum of the variables <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code>. The result is displayed on the line <code>Out[4]</code>.</p>
<p>Note the computation on line <code>In[4]</code> makes use of the variables <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code> that were defined on the previous lines <code>In[2]</code> and <code>In[3]</code>. <strong>Python is a calculator that remembers previous commands</strong>. When Python evaluates the input line <code>In[n]</code>, the evaluation is done in the context that includes information from all previous inputs: <code>In[1]</code>, <code>In[2]</code>, …, <code>In[n-1]</code>. This is a key paradigm you need to get used to when reading Python code. Every line of Python code runs in a “context” that includes all the commands that preceded it.</p>
<p>I know this sounds complicated, and you might be wondering why I’m inflicting this knowledge upon you in such an early stage of this introduction to Python. You have to trust me on this one—you need to know how to “run” a line of Python code and simulate in your head what it’s going to do. Let’s look at the input line <code>In[4]</code> as an example. I’ll narrate what’s going on from Python’s point of view:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve been asked to evaluate the expression <code>num1 + num2</code> which is the sum of two variables. The first thing I’m going to do is look up what the name <code>num1</code> corresponds to in the current context and I’ll see that <code>num1</code> is a variable we defined earlier when we stored the value 2.1 into it. Similarly, I will look up the name <code>num2</code> and find it has the value <code>3.4</code> because of the assignment statement we made on line <code>In[3]</code>. After these two lookups, I know that <code>num1 + num2</code> refers to the sum of two numbers, and I’ll compute this sum, showing the result on the output line <code>Out[4]</code>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does this make sense? Can you put yourself in Python’s shoes and see how Python interprets the commands it received and runs them?</p>
<hr/>
<p>Let’s look at another code example that shows how we can compute the average of the two numbers <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code>. The average of two numbers is the sum of these numbers divided by two:</p>
<pre> In[5]: (num1 + num2) / 2
Out[5]: 2.75
</pre>
<p>Using math notation, the average of the numbers $x_1$ and $x_2$ is expressed as $(x_1 + x_2)/2$, which is very similar. Note we used the parentheses <code>(</code> and <code>)</code> to tell Python to compute the sum of the numbers first, before dividing by two. I’m showing this example to illustrate the fact that the syntax of the Python expression <code>(num1+num2)/2</code> is very similar to standard math notation $(x_1 + x_2)/2$. If you know the math notation for plus, minus, times, divide, exponent, parentheses, etc. then you already know how the Python operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>**</code> (exponent),<code>(</code> and <code>)</code> work.</p>
<p>Remember that the best way to learn Python is to “play” with Python interactively. If you’re a Python beginner, I highly recommend you follow along all the examples in this blog post in an interactive prompt where you can type in commands and see what comes out. Remember, you can run this notebook by clicking on the <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/minireference/noBSstatsnotebooks/main?labpath=blogposts/python_for_stats.ipynb">JupyterLab binder link</a>, the <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/minireference/noBSstatsnotebooks/blob/main/blogposts/python_for_stats.ipynb">colab link</a>, or by enabling the <strong>Live Code</strong> feature from the rocket menu on the <a href="https://nobsstats.com/blogposts/python_for_stats.html">web version</a>.</p>
<p>In order to make it easy for you to copy-paste code blocks from this blog post into a notebook environment, from now on, I won’t show the input indicators <code>In[n]: </code> and instead show only the input commands. This will allow you to copy-paste commands directly into a Python prompt (Live Code webpage or notebook) and run them for yourself to see what happens. Here is a repeat of the input-output code from the previous code block using the new format.</p>
<pre>(num1 + num2) / 2
# 2.75
</pre>
<p>The input on the first line is the same as the input line <code>In[5]</code> we saw above. The second line shows the output prefixed with the <code>#</code>-character (a.k.a. hash-sign), which is used to denote comments in Python. This means the line <code># 2.75</code> will be ignored by the Python input parser. The text <code># 2.75</code> is only there for reference—it tells human readers what the expected output is supposed to be. Try copy-pasting these lines into a code cell inside your choice of a Python interactive coding environment. Run the code cell to check that you get the expected output 2.75 as indicated in the comment.</p>
<h4><span id="powerful-primitives-and-builtin-functions"></span>Powerful primitives and builtin functions<span></span></h4>
<p>Python is a “high level” programming language, which means it provides convenient data structures and functions for many common calculations. For example, suppose you want to compute the average grade from a list that contains the grades of the students in a class. We’ll assume the class has just four students, to keep things simple.</p>
<p>The math expression for computing the average grade for the list of grades $[g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4]$ is $(g_1 + g_2 + g_3 + g_4) / 4 = (\sum_{i=1}^{i=4} g_i ) / 4$. The symbol $\Sigma$ is the greek letter Sigma, which we use to denote summations. The expression $\sum_{i=1}^{i=4} g_i$ corresponds to the sum of the variables $g_i$ between $i=1$ and $i=4$. This is just fancy math notation for describing the sum $g_1 + g_2 + g_3 + g_4$.</p>
<p>The code example below defines the list <code>grades</code> that contains four numbers, then uses the Python builtin functions <code>sum</code> and <code>len</code> (length) to compute the average of these numbers (the average grade for this group of four students).</p>
<pre>grades = [80, 90, 70, 60]
avg = sum(grades) / len(grades)
avg
# 75.0
</pre>
<p>The first line of the above code block defines a list of four numbers <code>[80,90,70,60]</code> and stores this list of values in the variable named <code>grades</code>. The second line is an assignment statement, where the right hand side computes the sum of the grades divided by the length of the list, which is the formula for computing the average. The result of the sum-divided-by-length calculation is stored into a new variable called <code>avg</code> (short for average). Finally, the third line prints the contents of the variable <code>avg</code> to the screen.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Dear readers, I know all of the descriptions may feel like too much information (TMI), but I assure you learning how to use Python as a calculator is totally worth it. It’s really not that bad, and you’re already ahead in the game. If you were able to follow what’s going on in the above code examples, then you already know one of the most complicated parts of Python syntax: the assignment statement.</p>
<p><strong>Python reading exercise</strong>: revisit all the lines of code above where the symbol <code>=</code> appears, and read them out loud, remembering you must read them from right-to-left: “compute &lt;right hand side&gt; then store the result into &lt;left hand side&gt;”. That’s what the assignment statement does: it evaluates some expression (whatever appears to the right of the =) and stores the result into the place described by the left-hand side (usually a variable name).</p>
<p>There are two more Python concepts I would like to introduce you to: for-loops and functions. After that we’re done, I promise!</p>
<h4><span id="for-loops"></span>For loops<span></span></h4>
<p>The for-loop is a programming concept that allows us to repeat some operation or calculation multiple times. The most common use case of a <code>for</code>-loop is to perform some calculation for each element in a list. For example, we can use a <code>for</code> loop to compute the average of the numbers in the list <code>grades = [80,90,70,60]</code>. Normally, we would compute the average using the expression <code>avg = sum(grades)/len(grades)</code>, but suppose we don’t have access to the function <code>sum</code> for some reason, and so we must compute the sum using a for-loop.</p>
<p>We want to compute the sum 80 + 90 + 70 + 60, which we can also write as 0 + 80 + 90 + 70 + 60, since starting with 0 doesn’t change anything. We can break up this summation into a four-step process, where we add the individual numbers one by one to a running total, as illustrated in Figure 2.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sum-grades-underbraces-1024x247.png" alt="" width="750" height="181" srcset="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sum-grades-underbraces-1024x247.png 1024w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sum-grades-underbraces-300x72.png 300w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sum-grades-underbraces-768x185.png 768w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sum-grades-underbraces-1536x370.png 1536w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sum-grades-underbraces-2048x493.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Step-by-step calculation of the sum of four numbers. In each step we add one new number to the current total. This procedure takes four steps: one step for each number in the list.</p>
<p>Note the operation we perform in each step is the same—we add the current grade to the partial sum of the grades from the previous step.</p>
<p>Here is the Python code that computes the average of the grades in the list <code>grades</code> using a <code>for</code>-loop:</p>
<pre>total = 0
for grade in grades:
    total = total + grade
avg = total / len(grades)
avg
# 75.0
</pre>
<p>The first line defines the variable named <code>total</code> (initially containing <code>0</code>), which we’ll use to store the intermediate values of the sum at different steps. Next, the for loop tells Python to go through the list <code>grades</code> and for each <code>grade</code> in the list, perform the command <code>total = total + grade</code>. Note this statement is indented relative to the other code to indicate it is “inside” the for loop, which means it will be repeated for each element in the list. On the next line we divide the total by the length of the list to obtain the average, which we then display on the fifth line.</p>
<p>A for-loop describes a certain action or actions that you want Python to repeat. In this case, we have a list of grades $[g_1, g_2, g_3, g_4]$, and we want Python to repeat the action “add $g_i$ to the current total” four times, once for each number $g_i$ in the list. The variable <code>total</code> takes on different values while the code runs. Before the start of the for-loop, the variable total contains 0, we’ll refer to this as <code>total0</code>. Then Python starts the for-loop and runs the code block <code>total = total + grade</code> four times, once for each grade in the list grades, which has the effect of changing the value stored in the variable total four times. We’ll refer to the different values of the variable total as total1, total2, total3, and total4. See Figure 3 for the intermediate values of the variable total during the four steps of the for loop.</p>

<p>The key new idea here is that the same line of code <code>total = total + grade</code> corresponds to four different calculations. Visit <a href="https://pythontutor.com/render.html#code=%23%20define%20the%20list%20of%20grades%0Agrades%20%3D%20%5B80,%2090,%2070,%2060%5D%0A%0A%23%20compute%20the%20average%20grade%0Atotal%20%3D%200%0Afor%20grade%20in%20grades%3A%0A%20%20%20%20total%20%3D%20total%20%2B%20grade%0Aavg%20%3D%20total%20/%20len%28grades%29%0A%0Aprint%28avg%29&amp;cumulative=false&amp;curInstr=0&amp;heapPrimitives=nevernest&amp;mode=display&amp;origin=opt-frontend.js&amp;py=3&amp;rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&amp;textReferences=false">this page</a> to see a demonstration of how the variable <code>total</code> changes during the four steps of the for loop. At the end of the for loop, the variable <code>total</code> contains 300 which is the sum of the grades, and calculating <code>total/len(grades)</code> gives us the average grade, which gives the same result as the expression <code>sum(grades)/len(grades)</code> that we used earlier.</p>
<p>If this is the first time you’re seeing a for-loop in your life, the syntax might look a little weird, but don’t worry you’ll get used to it. I want you to know about for-loops because we can use for-loops to generate random samples and gain hands-on experience with statistics concepts like sampling distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. We’ll talk about these in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XusbfJoZ7CQxbeWPPXMM84BA-VeUn8lkPUuUy7RcW8M/edit">PART 2</a> of the series.</p>
<h4><span id="functions"></span>Functions<span></span></h4>
<p>Python is a useful calculator because of the numerous functions it comes with, which are like different calculator buttons you can press to perform computations.</p>
<p>We’ve already seen the function <code>sum</code> that computes the sum of a list of elements. This is one of the builtin Python functions that are available for you to use. You can think of <code>sum</code> as a calculator button that works on lists of numbers. Readers who are familiar with spreadsheet software might have already seen the spreadsheet function <code>SUM(&lt;RANGE\&gt;)</code> which computes the sum for a &lt;RANGE\&gt; of cells in the spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Here are some other examples of Python built-in functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>len</code>: computes the length of a list</li>
<li><code>range(0,n)</code>: creates a list of numbers <code>[0,1,2,3, ..., n-1]</code></li>
<li><code>min</code>/<code>max</code>: finds the smallest/largest value in a list</li>
<li><code>print</code>: prints some value to the screen</li>
<li><code>help</code>: shows helpful documentation</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning Python is all about getting to know the functions that are available to you.</p>
<p>Python also makes it easy to define new functions, which is like adding “custom” buttons to the calculator. For example, suppose we want to define a new button <code>mean</code> for computing the mean (average) of a list of values. Recall the math notation for calculating the average value for the list $[x_1, x_2, x_3, \ldots, x_n]$ is $(\sum_{i=1}^{i=n} x_i)/n$.</p>
<p>To <strong>define a Python function</strong> <code>mean</code> we can use the following code:</p>
<pre>def mean(values):
    total = 0
    for value in values:
        total = total + value
    avg = total / len(values)
    return avg
</pre>
<p>Let’s go through this code example line by line. To define a new Python function, we start with the keyword <code>def</code> followed by the function’s name, we then specify what variables the function expects as input in parentheses. In this case the function <code>mean</code> takes a single input called <code>values</code>. We end the line with the symbol <code>:</code>, which tells us the “body” of the function is about to start. The function body is an indented code block that specifies all the calculations that the function is supposed to perform. The last line in the function body is a <code>return</code> statement that tells us the output of the function. Note we’ve seen the calculations in the body of the function previously, when we computed the average of the list of grades <code>grades = [80,90,70,60]</code> using a <code>for</code>-loop.</p>
<p>The function <code>mean</code> encapsulates the steps of the procedure for calculating the mean and makes it available to us as a “button” we can press whenever we need to compute the mean of some list of numbers.</p>
<p>To <strong>call a Python function</strong>, we write its name followed by the input argument specified in parentheses. To call the function <code>mean</code> on the list of values <code>grades</code>, we use the following code:</p>
<pre>mean(grades)
# 75.0
</pre>
<p>When Python sees the expression <code>mean(grades)</code> it recognizes it as a function call. It then looks for the definition of the function mean and finds the <code>def</code> statement we showed in the previous code block, which tells us what steps need to be performed on the input.</p>
<p>The function <code>mean</code> can compute the average for any list of values, but when we call <code>mean(grades)</code> we are supplying the specific list <code>grades</code> as the input <code>values</code>. In other words, calling a function <code>mean</code> with the input <code>grades</code> is equivalent to the assignment statement <code>values = grades</code>, then running the code instructions in the body of the function. The return statement on the last line of the function’s body tells us the function output value is <code>avg</code>. After the function call is done, the expression mean(grades) gets replaced with the return value of the function, which is the number 75.

<p>Calling a function is like delegating some work to a contractor. You want to know the mean of the numbers in the list grades, so you give this task to the function <code>mean</code>, which does the calculation for you, and returns to you the final value.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Okay that’s it! If you were able to understand the Python code examples above, then you already know the three Python syntax primitives that you need for 90% of statistics calculations. If you want to learn more about Python, take a look at the <strong>Python tutorial</strong> (<a href="https://nobsstats.com/tutorials/python_tutorial.html">Appendix C</a>), which is a beginner-friendly introduction to Python syntax, data types, and builtin functions.</p>
<p><em>But wait there’s more…. I haven’t even shown you the best parts yet!</em></p>
<h3><span id="a-rich-ecosystem-of-python-libraries"></span>A rich ecosystem of Python libraries<span></span></h3>
<p>Python is a popular language because of the numerous functions it comes with. You can “import” various Python modules and functions to do specialized calculations like numerical computing (NumPy), scientific computing (SciPy), data management (Pandas), data visualization (Seaborn), and statistical modelling (statsmodels).</p>
<p>We’ll now briefly mention a few of the Python libraries that are useful when learning statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pandas</strong> is the Swiss army knife of data manipulations. Pandas provides functions for loading data from various formats (CSV files, spreadsheets, databases, etc.). Once you have loaded your data, Pandas provides all the functions you might need for data processing, data cleaning, and descriptive statistics. See below for basic code examples. Check the <a href="https://nobsstats.com/tutorials/pandas_tutorial.html">tutorial</a> and the <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html">docs</a> for more info.</li>
<li><strong>Seaborn</strong> allows you to generate beautiful data visualizations. When working with data, we often want to generate statistical visualizations like strip plots, scatter plots, histograms, bar plots, box plots, etc. The library Seaborn offers functionality for creating such plots and all kinds of other data visualizations. Check out the <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html">gallery of plot examples</a> to get an idea for the types of plots you can generate using Seaborn. See below for basic examples or check the <a href="https://nobsstats.com/tutorials/seaborn_tutorial.html">tutorial</a> and the <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html">docs</a> for more details.</li>
<li><strong>NumPy</strong> and <strong>SciPy</strong> contain all the scientific computing functions you might need. In particular, the module <code>scipy.stats</code> contains all the probability models we use in statistics. We’ll show some examples of probability models in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XusbfJoZ7CQxbeWPPXMM84BA-VeUn8lkPUuUy7RcW8M/edit">PART 2</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Statsmodels</strong> is a statistical modelling library that includes advanced statistical models and pre-defined functions for performing statistical tests.</li>
<li><strong>SymPy</strong> is a library for symbolic math calculations. Using SymPy you can work with math expressions just like when solving math problems using pen and paper. SymPy calculations are useful because functions like <code>solve</code>, <code>simplify</code>, <code>expand</code>, and <code>factor</code> can do the math for you. See the <a href="https://minireference.com/static/tutorials/sympy_tutorial.pdf">tutorial</a> for more info and try some commands in the <a href="https://live.sympy.org/">SymPy live shell</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So yes, Python is just like a calculator, but because it comes with all the above libraries, it’s like the best calculator ever! We’ll now show some examples that highlight the usefulness of the Seaborn library for data visualizations.</p>
<h3><span id="data-visualization-using-seaborn"></span>Data visualization using Seaborn<span></span></h3>
<p>The first part of any statistical analysis is to look at the data. <a href="https://nobsstats.com/notebooks/13_descriptive_statistics.html">Descriptive statistics</a> is a general term we use to refer to all the visualizations and calculations we do based on a sample in order to describe its properties. Statistical plots give us visual summaries for data samples. Examples of such plots include scatter plots, bar plots, box plots, etc. We can easily create all these visual summaries using the Python library Seaborn, which makes statistical plotting very straightforward.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some examples of data visualizations based on a sample of prices, which we will represent as a list of nine values (prices collected at different locations).</p>
<pre>prices = [11.8, 10, 11, 8.6, 8.3, 9.4, 8, 6.8, 8.5]
</pre>
<p>Next we’ll import the module <code>seaborn</code> under the alias <code>sns</code>.</p>
<pre>import seaborn as sns
</pre>
<p>This is called an “import statement” in Python, and its effect is to make all the functions in the seaborn module available by calling them as <code>sns.&lt;functionname\&gt;</code>. We use the alias <code>sns</code> instead of the full module name <code>seaborn</code> to save a few keystrokes.</p>
<p>Statistical plots can be generated by specifying <code>prices</code> as the x-input to one of the seaborn plot-functions. We can use <code>sns.stripplot</code> to generate a strip plot, <code>sns.histplot</code> to generate a histogram, or <code>sns.boxplot</code> to generate a box-plot, as shown below:</p>
<pre>sns.stripplot(x=prices, jitter=0)
# See Figure 4 (a)

sns.histplot(x=prices)
# See Figure 4 (b)

sns.boxplot(x=prices)
# See Figure 4 (c)
</pre>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epricesW_strip_hist_box_plots-1024x225.png" alt="" width="750" height="165" srcset="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epricesW_strip_hist_box_plots-1024x225.png 1024w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epricesW_strip_hist_box_plots-300x66.png 300w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epricesW_strip_hist_box_plots-768x168.png 768w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epricesW_strip_hist_box_plots-1536x337.png 1536w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epricesW_strip_hist_box_plots.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>The plot shown in Figure 4 (a) shows the “raw data,” with each value in the prices list represented as a separate point, whose $x$-location within the graph corresponds to the price. The histogram in Figure 4 (b) shows what happens when we count the numbers of observations in separate “bins.” The higher the bar, the more observations in that bin. Finally, the box-plot in Figure 4 (c) shows the location of the quartiles of the <code>prices</code> data (to be defined shortly).</p>
<p>Data visualization is an essential part of any statistical analysis, and the Seaborn library is a best-in-class tool for doing statistical visualizations: <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxplot.html">box plots</a>, <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html">histograms</a>, <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.scatterplot.html">scatter plots</a>, <a href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.violinplot.html">violin</a><a href="https://twitter.com/anniierau/status/1674496819605241856">plots</a>, etc. Anything you might want to do, there is probably a plot function for it in Seaborn. As a first step to learning Seaborn, you can check out the <strong>Seaborn tutorial</strong> (<a href="https://nobsstats.com/tutorials/seaborn_tutorial.html">Appendix E</a>), which explains the essential Seaborn plotting functions that we use in the book.</p>
<hr/>
<h3><span id="data-manipulations-with-pandas"></span>Data manipulations with Pandas<span></span></h3>
<p>Data is the fuel for statistics. All statistical calculations start with data collection and processing. The Python library Pandas provides lots of helpful functions for data manipulations. Understanding what Pandas can do is best done through examples, so we’ll now show some real-world code examples of using Pandas. We don’t have time to explain all the details, so we’ll use the show-don’t-tell approach in this section.</p>
<h4><span id="electricity-prices-dataset"></span>Electricity prices dataset<span></span></h4>
<p>We’ll use a dataset <a href="https://github.com/minireference/noBSstatsnotebooks/blob/main/datasets/epriceswide.csv">epriceswide.csv</a> which consists of 18 samples of electricity prices collected from charging stations in the East End and the West End of a city. Figure 5 shows the data as appears when viewed online, when opened with a simple text editor, and when viewed using spreadsheet software like LibreOffice Calc.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epriceswide-three-views-1024x537.png" alt="" width="750" height="393" srcset="https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epriceswide-three-views-1024x537.png 1024w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epriceswide-three-views-300x157.png 300w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epriceswide-three-views-768x403.png 768w, https://minireference.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/epriceswide-three-views.png 1367w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"/></p>
<p>We call this data format CSV, which is short for comma-separated values. CSV files are very common in both industry and academia, since they are a very simple data format that can be opened with many software tools.</p>
<h4>Data extraction<span></span></h4>
<p>We can use the function <code>read_csv</code> from the Pandas module to load the data from a CSV file, which can be a local file or a URL (an internet location). Pandas provides other functions like <code>read_excel</code> and <code>read_db_table</code> for loading data from other data formats.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the commands we need to load the data file <a href="https://github.com/minireference/noBSstatsnotebooks/blob/main/datasets/epriceswide.csv">epriceswide.csv</a> from a web URL .</p>
<pre>import pandas as pd
epriceswide = pd.read_csv(&#34;https://nobsstats.com/datasets/epriceswide.csv&#34;)
epriceswide
#    East  West
# 0   7.7  11.8
# 1   5.9  10.0
# 2   7.0  11.0
# 3   4.8   8.6
# 4   6.3   8.3
# 5   6.3   9.4
# 6   5.5   8.0
# 7   5.4   6.8
# 8   6.5   8.5
</pre>
<p>The first line <code>import pandas as pd</code> imported the pandas library under the alias <code>pd</code>. This is similar to how we imported <code>seaborn</code> as <code>sns</code>. The shorter alias will save us some typing. Next we call the function <code>pd.read_csv</code> to load the data, and store the result in a variable called <code>epriceswide</code>, which we then print on the next line. The variable <code>epriceswide</code> contains a Pandas data frame, which is similar to a spreadsheet (a table of values whose rows are numbered and whose columns have names).</p>
<p>The data frame <code>epriceswide</code> contains two columns of prices from the West End and the East End of a city.</p>
<p>I’m interested only in the prices in the West End of the city (the second column). To extract the prices from the West End of the city we use the following Pandas code.</p>
<pre>pricesW = epriceswide[&#34;West&#34;]
pricesW
# 0    11.8
# 1    10.0
# 2    11.0
# 3     8.6
# 4     8.3
# 5     9.4
# 6     8.0
# 7     6.8
# 8     8.5
</pre>
<p>The square brackets syntax has the effect of selecting the data from one of the columns. The variable <code>pricesW</code> corresponds to a Pandas series object, which is similar to a list, but has many useful functions “attached” to it.</p>
<h4><span id="descriptive-statistics-using-pandas"></span>Descriptive statistics using Pandas<span></span></h4>
<p>We can easily compute summary statistics like the mean, the median, the variance, the standard deviation, etc., from any Pandas data frame or series by calling a function of the same name: <code>mean</code>, <code>median</code>, <code>var</code>, <code>std</code>, etc. These numerical summaries are called descriptive statistics, and they are very useful for understanding the characteristics of the dataset.</p>
<p>For example, to see the number of observations in the series <code>pricesW</code>(the sample size), we use the function <code>.count()</code>.</p>
<pre>pricesW.count()
# 9
</pre>
<p>Note the syntax is <code>pricesW.count()</code> and not <code>count(pricesW)</code>. This is because the function <code>count()</code> is “attached” to the <code>pricesW</code> object. Functions attached to objects are called methods. The syntax for calling a method is a little weird, <code>obj.fun()</code>, but the effect is the same as <code>fun(obj)</code>.</p>
<p>To compute the sample mean $\overline{\mathbf{x}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^9 x_i$, we call the <code>.mean()</code> method on <code>pricesW</code>.</p>
<pre>pricesW.mean()
# 9.155555555555557
</pre>
<p>To compute the median (50th percentile), we call the <code>.median()</code> method:</p>
<pre>pricesW.median()
# 8.6
</pre>
<p>To compute the sample standard deviation $s_{\mathbf{x}} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n-1}\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^n \left(x_i – \overline{\mathbf{x}} \right)^2 }$, we call the <code>.std()</code> method:</p>
<pre>pricesW.std()
# 1.5621388471508475
</pre>
<p>Note the standard deviation is a complicated math formula involving subtraction, squaring, summation, divisions, and square root, but we didn’t have to do any of these math operations, since the predefined Pandas function <code>std</code> did the standard deviation calculation for us. Thanks Pandas!</p>
<p>The method <code>.describe()</code> computes all numerical descriptive statistics for the sample in one shot:</p>
<pre>pricesW.describe()
# count     9.000000
# mean      9.155556
# std       1.562139
# min       6.800000
# 25%       8.300000
# 50%       8.600000
# 75%      10.000000
# max      11.800000
</pre>
<p>This result includes the count, the mean, the standard deviation, as well as a “five-number summary” of the data, which consists of the minimum value (0th percentile), the first quartile (25th percentile), the median (50th percentile), the third quartile (75th percentile), and the maximum value (100th percentile).</p>
<h4><span id="data-cleaning-using-pandas"></span>Data cleaning using Pandas<span></span></h4>
<p>Another important class of transformations is data cleaning: making sure data values are expressed in a standardized format, correcting input errors, and otherwise restructuring the data to make it suitable for analysis. Using various filtering and selection functions within Pandas allows you to do most data cleaning operations without too much trouble.</p>
<p>Using Pandas for data loading, data transformations, and data cleaning are useful skills to develop if you want to apply statistics to real-world situations. To learn more about Pandas, I’ll refer you to the <a href="https://nobsstats.com/notebooks/13_descriptive_statistics.html">notebook for Section 1.3</a> which is a condensed crash course on Pandas methods for descriptive statistics, and the <strong>Pandas tutorial</strong> (<a href="https://nobsstats.com/tutorials/pandas_tutorial.html">Appendix D</a>) which contains info about data manipulation techniques.</p>
<h2><span id="how-much-python-do-you-need-to-know"></span>How much Python do you need to know?<span></span></h2>
<p>After all this talk about learning Python, I want to remind you that you don’t need to become a Python programmer! As long as you know how to use Python as a calculator, then you’re in business. Specifically, here are the skills I believe everyone can pick up:</p>
<ul>
<li>run code cells in an interactive notebook environment (using JupyterLab online or on your computer)</li>
<li>know how to open/edit notebooks (I’ve prepared <a href="https://github.com/minireference/noBSstatsnotebooks/tree/main/notebooks">notebooks</a> to accompany each section in the book)</li>
<li>run data visualization code examples (i.e. use basic Seaborn functions)</li>
<li>run code examples for data manipulations (i.e. use Pandas for loading datasets)</li>
<li>experiment by changing parameters in existing simulations</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if you’re an absolute beginner in Python and don’t want to learn Python, you can still benefit from the code examples in the notebooks as a spectator. Just running the code and seeing what happens. You’ll also be able to solve some of the exercises by simply copy-pasting commands.</p>
<p>Once you gain some experience with basic Python commands and learn the common function of the Pandas and Seaborn libraries, you’ll be able to apply these skills to load new datasets and generate your own visualizations. Learning Pandas and Seaborn will allow you to tackle real world datasets, not just the ones prepared for this book.</p>
<p>Your knowledge of basic Python will be very helpful for understanding probability and statistics. Here are some examples of activities that will be available to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the <code>scipy.stats</code> probability models (these are the LEGOs of the XXIst century)</li>
<li>run probability simulations</li>
<li>perform statistical analyses (multi-step procedures with lots of complicated steps)</li>
<li>use Python calculations to verify statistical results like p-values and confidence interval coverage probabilities</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll talk more about these in PART 2 of the blog post series.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize that all these calculations are accessible in “spectator mode” where you run the notebooks to see what happens, without any expectation of writing new code. As you gain more Python experience over time, you’ll be able to modify the code examples and adapt them to solving new problems.</p>
<h2><span id="conclusion"></span>Conclusion<span></span></h2>
<p>I hope the code examples in this blog post convinced you that learning Python is not that complicated. I also hope you take my word for it that knowing how to use Python as a calculator will be very helpful when learning statistics.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XusbfJoZ7CQxbeWPPXMM84BA-VeUn8lkPUuUy7RcW8M/edit">next post</a> (PART 2 of 3) we’ll talk about specific probability and statistics concepts that become easier to understand when you can “play” with them using the Python calculator. Indeed, Python makes working with fancy, complicated, mathy topics like random variables and their probability distributions as easy as playing with LEGOs. We can also use Python to run probability simulations, which can be very helpful for understanding conceptually-difficult concepts like sampling distributions.</p>
<p>In the final post (PART 3 of 3) I’ll describe how the <strong>PYTHON+STATS curriculum</strong> is packaged and delivered in the upcoming textbook <a href="https://nobsstats.com/">No Bullshit Guide to Statistics</a>. I’ve been working on this book for the past 5+ years, continuously optimizing the structure of the book to make it accessible for the average reader. I want every adult learner who wants to learn statistics to have a concise guide to the material, including explanations for how things work “under the hood” in terms of probability calculations.</p>

<h4><span id="ps-why-not-r"></span>PS: Why not R?<span></span></h4>
<p>This question is bound to come up, so I’ll go ahead and answer it preemptively. The R ecosystem (<a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>, <a href="https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/">RStudio</a>, <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">RMarkdown</a>, <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">CRAN packages</a>, <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/">tidyverse</a>, etc.) is also a very good platform for learning statistics. Some might even say R is better than Python, since it is a programming language specially designed for statistics. Certainly, if your goal is to learn advanced statistical techniques, then learning R would be a good choice given the numerous packages available in R. For learning basic statistics, however, R and Python are equally good.</p>
<p>I chose Python for the book because it is an easy language to learn, with minimal syntax rules, and good naming conventions. Python is a general purpose language, which means the Python skills you develop for statistical calculations can be used for all kinds of other tasks beyond statistics including, web programming, data science, and machine learning. Learning Python will make you part of a community of millions of Pythonistas (people who use Python), which makes it very likely you’ll be able to find help whenever you get stuck on a problem, and find lots of learning resources for beginners.</p>
<p>All this being said, I still think R is very useful to know, and I plan to release R notebooks to accompany the book at some point. A multi-language approach would be great for learning, since you see the same concept explained twice, which is good for understanding the underlying statistical principles.</p>
