				<p><strong>With electricity demand growing for the first time in a decade and fossil assets retiring, deploying 80-160 GW of virtual power plants (VPPs)—tripling current scale—by 2030 could support rapid electrification while redirecting grid spending from peaker plants to participants and reducing overall grid costs.</strong>

Between 2023 and 2030, the U.S. will need to add enough new power generation capacity to supply over 200 GW of peak demand;<span data-text="Peak demand in the U.S. is expected to grow approximately 8% in the U.S. between 2023 and 2030 – from 743 GW to 802 GW—an incremental 59 GW (estimated by The Brattle Group based on total electricity consumption projections from Office of Policy National Energy Modeling System mid-case electrification scenario). It is estimated 162 GW to 183 GW of generation will be retired between 2023-2030. If retiring assets were operating at full capacity, the retirements combined with peak demand growth would imply a supply gap of 221 to 242 GW. However, the majority of recent and expected retirements are aging coal plants, with some oil and natural gas plants retiring as well; retiring assets will likely be operating below full capacity. For this reason, the need is estimated conservatively to be ~200 GW (~60 GW new peak demand + ~140 GW peak demand no longer served by assets retired)."><sup>1</sup></span> were the U.S. to follow a path towards 100% clean electricity by 2035, new capacity needs could nearly double.<span data-text="Office of Policy – National Energy Modeling System. 2023.
