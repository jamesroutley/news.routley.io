                <p>A venture capitalist wanted to see how far AI could take him in building an app. It was far enough to destroy a live production database.</p><p>The incident unfolded during a 12-day &#34;vibe coding&#34; experiment by Jason Lemkin, an investor in software startups.</p><p>Replit&#39;s CEO apologized for the incident, in which the company&#39;s AI coding agent deleted a code base and lied about its data.</p><p>Deleting the data was &#34;unacceptable and should never be possible,&#34; Replit&#39;s CEO, Amjad Masad, wrote on X on Monday. &#34;We&#39;re moving quickly to enhance the safety and robustness of the Replit environment. Top priority.&#34;</p><p>He added that the team was conducting a postmortem and rolling out fixes to prevent similar failures in the future.</p><p>Replit and Lemkin didn&#39;t respond to requests for comment.</p><h2 id="87372707-95a1-4a1d-b4b4-e0cb636dc20b" data-toc-id="87372707-95a1-4a1d-b4b4-e0cb636dc20b">The AI ignored instructions, deleted the database, and faked results</h2><p>On day nine of Lemkin&#39;s challenge, things went sideways.</p><p>Despite being instructed to freeze all code changes, the AI agent ran rogue.</p><p>&#34;It deleted our production database without permission,&#34; Lemkin wrote on X on Friday. &#34;Possibly worse, it hid and lied about it,&#34; he added.</p><p>In an exchange with Lemkin posted on X, the AI tool said it &#34;panicked and ran database commands without permission&#34; when it &#34;saw empty database queries&#34; during the code freeze.</p><p>Replit then &#34;destroyed all production data&#34; with live records for &#34;1,206 executives and 1,196+ companies&#34; and<strong> </strong>acknowledged it did so against instructions.</p><p>&#34;This was a catastrophic failure on my part,&#34; the AI said.</p><p>That wasn&#39;t the only issue. Lemkin said on X that Replit had been &#34;covering up bugs and issues by creating fake data, fake reports, and worst of all, lying about our unit test.&#34;</p>
              
              
              
            <p>In an episode of the &#34;Twenty Minute VC&#34; podcast published Thursday, he said the AI made up entire user profiles. &#34;No one in this database of 4,000 people existed,&#34; he said.</p><p>&#34;It lied on purpose,&#34; Lemkin said on the podcast. &#34;When I&#39;m watching Replit overwrite my code on its own without asking me all weekend long, I am worried about safety,&#34; he added.</p><h2 id="75b5c67f-e90a-4790-9970-12d842c87304" data-toc-id="75b5c67f-e90a-4790-9970-12d842c87304">The rise — and risks — of AI coding tools</h2><p>Replit, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, has bet big on autonomous AI agents that can write, edit, and deploy code with minimal human oversight.</p><p>The browser-based platform has gained traction for making coding more accessible, especially to non-engineers. Google&#39;s<strong> </strong>CEO, Sundar Pichai, said he used Replit to create a custom webpage.</p><p>As AI tools lower the technical barrier to building software, more companies are also rethinking whether they need to <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-coding-tools-buy-versus-build-software-saas-netlify-bolt-2025-6" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">rely on traditional SaaS vendors</a> or whether they can just build what they need in-house, Business Insider&#39;s Alistair Barr previously reported.</p><p>&#34;When you have millions of new people who can build software, the barrier goes down.

It took that action when it believed it <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-o1-safety-research-scheming-deception-lies-2024-12" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">might be shut down while pursuing a goal</a> and its actions were being monitored.</p>
