    <h1>Four dead in fire as Tesla doors fail to open after crash</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A devastating accident in Toronto involving a Tesla Model Y resulted in the tragic deaths of four individuals and the miraculous rescue of a young woman. The crash, which occurred on October 24, has raised serious questions about the safety of Tesla’s electronic door mechanisms.</p>



<p>A Tesla Model Y carrying five passengers lost control while traveling at high speed. The vehicle struck a guardrail and subsequently collided with a concrete pillar, bursting into flames upon impact. The collision took place on a local roadway, as confirmed by Toronto Police Duty Inspector Phillip Sinclair during a news conference.</p>



<p>Three men, aged 26, 29, and 32, and a 30-year-old woman were pronounced dead at the scene. A 25-year-old woman survived the horrific accident and was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.</p>



<p>The sole survivor owes her life to the quick actions of Rick Harper, a 73-year-old Canada Post worker, who came upon the burning vehicle. Harper, along with other bystanders, noticed that the passengers were trapped inside the Tesla, unable to open the electronic doors.</p>



<p>Harper recounted to the <a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/she-couldn-t-get-out-deadly-toronto-tesla-fire-draws-attention-to-risk-of-electronic/article_c9313fbe-9ad0-11ef-998a-93ba9a9927d5.html?utm_source=rakuten&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;ranMID=53416&amp;ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-dj2l96o7bRjk1fk9blY9lQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Toronto Star</a>, “You couldn’t open the doors. I would assume the young lady would have tried to open the door from the inside because she was pretty desperate to get out.” Harper grabbed a bar from his truck and handed it to another bystander, who managed to break the back window and pull the young woman to safety.</p>

<p>The Tesla Model Y’s electronic doors, which require power to operate, have come under scrutiny following the accident. Authorities are investigating whether the failure of these doors contributed to the fatalities. Harper mentioned that the thick smoke made it difficult to see the other passengers trapped inside, further complicating rescue efforts.</p>



<p>Tesla has faced criticism in the past for the design of its manual release levers, which are considered poorly designed and unintuitively placed. These emergency measures require intimate knowledge of the car, something that may not be feasible in a panic situation.</p>

<p>The Toronto Police and fire authorities are conducting a thorough investigation into the crash. Deputy Fire Chief Jim Jessop stated that they are examining the possibility that the intensity of the fire was linked to the car’s battery cells.</p>



<p>The crash has also highlighted concerns about the safety of electric vehicles in high-speed collisions. Despite the presence of manual release mechanisms in most Tesla models, the ease of access and usability of these features remain contentious issues.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.tps.ca/media-centre/news-releases/61244/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a>, Inspector Sinclair emphasized that no other vehicles were involved in the crash, and the investigation is ongoing. He also extended gratitude to Harper for his brave actions, stating, “Thanks very much to that bystander. We have been speaking to them, and obviously, they also are deeply affected by this incident, a very horrific scene for that bystander to step in.”</p>



<p>Harper expressed his shock and sorrow after learning about the deaths of the other passengers. “I was totally shocked. It really hit me when I saw the report in the news that four had died,” he told <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/fatal-crash-four-dead-lake-shore-cherry-1.7361751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CBC News</a>. Harper was later informed by detectives that the young woman he rescued was recuperating in the hospital.</p>



<p>This tragic incident has sparked a debate about the safety features of electric vehicles and the necessity for more intuitive emergency mechanisms. As authorities continue their investigation, the focus remains on understanding the causes of the crash and preventing such tragedies in the future.</p>



<p>Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the company is likely to face increased scrutiny over the safety and design of its vehicles’ electronic systems. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential risks associated with advanced automotive technology and the importance of accessible emergency features.</p>
