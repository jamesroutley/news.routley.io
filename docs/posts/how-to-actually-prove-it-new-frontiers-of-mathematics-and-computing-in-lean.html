The magic ingredient here is this weird little tool for planning Lean
projects called <a href="https://github.com/PatrickMassot/leanblueprint">Lean Blueprints</a>.

Blueprints are a mechanism mathematicians have designed for planning
out formalisations of their results. When translating a pen and paper
result into a proof assistant, a mathematician must first encode all
the necessary definitions, helper lemmas and so on before they can
write the proof. The blueprint serves as a mechanism to keep track of
this process.
</p>

<p>
The above image shows an example blueprint, taken from Terrence Tao&#39;s
<a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2023/11/18/formalizing-the-proof-of-pfr-in-lean4-using-blueprint-a-short-tour/">blog post on the PFR formalistion</a>. It&#39;s a graph where the nodes
represent different definitions, lemmas and theorems in the
formalisation. The colour indicates the status of the
formalisation. Green means that it is proven; light blue means that
they can be stated but have not been proven, and the remaining nodes
(black here) are those that can not even be written down yet (they
might be require some definitions to be written down first).
</p>

<p>
The reason this is exciting is because for the first time we have
features for proof assistants that have been developed <i>by
mathematicians</i> <b>for mathematicians</b>, rather than by computer scientists,
as was the case before in proof assistants such as Rocq. Furthermore,
as these formalisations are done in version control, we actually have
unique access to see how the blueprint itself changed over time as the
project was formalised.
</p>

<p>
For example, if we keep track of a single node, we can see how it goes
from not even being ready to be stated (yellow), stated (blue) and
proven (green):
</p>



<p>
If we look at the state of the graph around these nodes, we have
access to a huge amount of data providing unique insights into how
mathematicians go about actually proving stuff and build new tools,
techniques, maybe train a few ML models, to help mathematicians prove
things.
</p>

<p>
To get the ball rolling, I&#39;ve been playing around with extracting this
data from the version control of active Lean formalisations and trying
to plot it out.
