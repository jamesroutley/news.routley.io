<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/details/stackexchange" rel="nofollow noreferrer">data dump</a> usually get refreshed the first weekend of the month, every 3 months.</p>
<p>The current Data dump is still from March. Is there just a problem and it&#39;s delayed like <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/377171/waiting-for-march-2022-dump">in the past</a>?</p>

<h2>The upload to the Internet Archive has been disabled.</h2>
<p>The job that uploads the data dump to Archive.org was disabled on 28 March, and marked to not be re-enabled without approval of senior leadership. Had it run as scheduled, it would have completed on the first Monday after the first Sunday in June.</p>
<p>I mention the timing, as this change long pre-dated the current moderator strike and related policy changes. Some comments have suggested otherwise, so I thought it an important detail.</p>
<h2>Is it going to stay that way?</h2>
<p>Hopefully the Company will provide an answer that includes this.</p>
<p><em>Edit: The following is an excerpt from <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/390040/314146">a different answer</a> provided by <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/1196463/jody-bailey">Jody Bailey, CTO</a> of Stack Overflow:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are looking for ways to gate access to the Dump, APIs, and SEDE, that will allow individuals access to the data while preventing misuse by organizations looking to profit from the work of our community. We are working to design and implement appropriate safeguards and still sorting out the details and timelines. We will provide regular updates on our progress to this group.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How can I access that data?</h2>
<p><a href="https://data.stackexchange.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stack Exchange Data Explorer</a> (aka SEDE) contains a subset of all data for all sites, with PII removed. The same data available in the data dump is also available on SEDE.</p>
<p>SEDE is updated via a weekly full refresh (every weekend). The Data Dump that is uploaded to Archive.org is a dump of the SEDE databases. The weekly SEDE refresh runs, then the data is dumped to XML &amp; 7zipped, then the 7z files are uploaded to the Archive.</p>
<p>SEDE can&#39;t address all the use cases of the Data Dump, nor vice versa. However, there is overlap, and the data is at least queryable.</p>
<hr/><p>
Hopefully any questions around &#34;why&#34; or &#34;what&#39;s next&#34; will be addressed by an official response.

<p>Few things have made me more livid than what we&#39;ve just learned through the <a href="https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/390023/249658">answer given by AMtwo</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The data dump is one of the main reasons why I&#39;m still participating to this day and has been part of the core values of this community. Please restore it, or consult with us to establish some equivalent way to protect and export our contributions as a whole.</strong></p>
<p>I would like to bring the following pieces of history to the foreground. This is an excerpt of Joel Spolsky speaking on the <a href="https://dev.to/stackpodcast/podcast-84" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Stack Overflow podcast #84</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, expropriation of community content that... We created Stack
Overflow to be against it. If there&#39;s anything that&#39;s more in the DNA
of Stack Overflow than that, I don&#39;t know what it is. That&#39;s one of
our most core things. You can see this all over the place in the
design of Stack Overflow.</p>
<p>First of all, from day one, we use the CC-wiki license. And it&#39;s
basically a license, it says that we don&#39;t own the content that&#39;s on
there, which is why we make those database dumps that are available.</p>
<p>Because we wanted to make sure that if no matter what happens,
literally no matter who we sell to, or raise money from, or turn the
site over to, and even if they take Stack Overflow, and make it an
evil site where you have to pay to look at things and there&#39;s pop-up
ads and pop-under ads, and you know, dancing chariots of fire that
cross the screen and punch the monkey, and, man, I can take so many
evil things anyway. And it just becomes a big gigantic spam site.</p>
<p>Doesn&#39;t matter because just take the latest CC-wiki download that we
provided and go start your own site saying, you know what, this is
gonna be the clean version. And I think a lot of people will follow
you. We very, very deliberately built Stack Overflow in a way that there
wouldn&#39;t be any chance of locking and we&#39;re pretty much doing the same
thing with Stack Exchange.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, on the <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2009/06/04/stack-overflow-creative-commons-data-dump/">blog</a>, written by Jeff Atwood in 2009:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The community has selflessly provided all this content in the spirit
of sharing and helping each other. In that very same spirit, we are
happy to return the favor by providing a database dump of public data.</p>

<p><em>We&#39;re probably going to degrade the experience for people within the community who used to use these dumps because we need to somehow get companies to pay us to use this data in a more friendly way.</em></p>

<p><em>Group?</em></p>
<p>Do they mean <em>group</em> as in <em>group of users interested in the dumps</em>? Or, are they that detached with the community that they call these sites <em>groups</em> like you have WhatsApp <em>groups</em>?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I can&#39;t believe this was actually unironically written when they didn&#39;t even bother to tell the community that this was happening.</p>
<p>I guess this is what comes from having employees that no longer interact with the community.</p>
<p>Anyone who seriously trusts SO after all they&#39;ve done deserves to be fooled.</p>

<p>That ship has <em>sailed</em>. OpenAI&#39;s models famously have a knowledge cut-off date of 2021, and few people care. Stack Exchange data is gathered, and fed into these models, via <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">the Common Crawl project</a>. Nobody is using Stack Exchange Data Dumps to train AI models.</p>
<p>Even if you were willing to violate the CC BY-SA licenses (of various versions) under which we contributed all that we have contributed, and release the data dumps under some restrictive license, <em>it would achieve nothing</em>, because these companies are <em>already</em> not respecting the restrictions of the licenses.</p>
<p>Rightly or wrongly (imo, wrongly), <em>All Rights Reserved</em> is being interpreted as legal permission to perform bulk statistical analyses that launder away any hope of attribution, then justify the actions by the fact that attribution becomes technically impossible. Our CC BY-SA license doesn&#39;t stand a chance. If Prosus wants a return on its investment in Stack Overflow, it should consider putting its weight behind getting the &#34;SA&#34; part of the license enforced against the likes of OpenAI. (I&#39;d happily waive 20% of my part of the settlement from a collective-action lawsuit, if you want to profit more directly, and I&#39;m happy to negotiate something higher.)</p>
<p>What you&#39;re doing now is just… destroying the network. For no good reason. I&#39;ve <em>stopped recommending people to Stack Overflow</em> – when normally I would be teaching entire classes full of students how to use it. I am now <a href="https://retrocomputing.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1202/278"><em>actively avoiding contributing Q&amp;A</em></a>, which is a shame, because I&#39;ve got 7 or 8 Q&amp;A pairs tucked away in my drafts folder, meant for Stack Overflow, that I may never have the motivation to polish up now.</p>
<p>What you hope to achieve here is unachievable. Ask your lawyer. Heck, ask on <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/">Law Stack Exchange</a>. What you&#39;re doing is <em>not helping</em>, and you do not know that you do not know that.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Side note: SEDE is already gated behind a Google ReCAPTCHA for not-logged-in users. That&#39;s to prevent people taking down your servers with a trillion high-intensity unauthenticated requests, but it serves this purpose quite competently, too. (If you want to make it slightly stricter, gate un-ReCAPTCHA&#39;d SEDE behind the 15-reputation barrier used for upvoting: we have solid empirical evidence that that&#39;s high enough to make abuse detectable and manageable.)</p>

<p>Stack Overflow senior leadership is working on a strategy to protect Stack Overflow data from being misused by companies building LLMs. While working on this strategy, we decided to stop the dump until we could put guardrails in place.</p>
<p>We are working on setting up the infrastructure to do this correctly in the age of LLMs --- where we continue to be open and share the data with our developer community but work to set up a formal framework for large AI companies that want to leverage the data.</p>
<p>We are looking for ways to gate access to the Dump, APIs, and SEDE,  that will allow individuals access to the data while preventing misuse by organizations looking to profit from the work of our community. We are working to design and implement appropriate safeguards and still sorting out the details and timelines. We will provide regular updates on our progress to this group.</p>
