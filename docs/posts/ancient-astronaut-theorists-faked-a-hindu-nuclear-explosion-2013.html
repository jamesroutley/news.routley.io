<h2><span>How Ancient Astronaut Theorists Faked a Hindu Nuclear Explosion</span></h2>



<div><p><em><strong>Note: </strong>This article was updated in 2013 to include new information.</em></p></div>

<div><SPAN color="#c23b3b"><span>The very spring and root of </span><strong>honesty</strong><span> and virtue lie in the felicity of lighting on good education.</span></SPAN></div>

<div><p>Ancient Astronaut Theorists (AATs for short) have spent fifty years arguing that ancient Hindu texts present firsthand reports of prehistoric nuclear explosions. I have discussed and debunked the case of nuclear weapons in my eBook <a href="https://www.jasoncolavito.com/ancient-atom-bombs.html"><em>Ancient Atom Bombs</em></a>, where a fuller discussion of the claim can be found. <span>However, a major problem with efforts at debunking AATs&#39; claims is that most scientific debunkers focus on, logically enough, the science involved since the most prominent debunkers tend to be physicists, evolutionary biologists, astronomers, etc. Fewer are experts in history and the humanities, which AATs have exploited, basing much of their evidence on ancient texts and artwork that hard scientists are not always able to effectively debunk on the merits of individual cases. </span>Even an archaeologist, by dint of specialization, may not have the broad cross-cultural knowledge to spot the mistake in a quotation from a sacred text from an unfamiliar culture or time period.</p></div>

<blockquote><strong>In the <em>Mausola Purva</em>, we find this singular description, which must have been incomprehensible to nineteenth-century ethnologists though not to us today: “…it was an unknown weapon, an iron thunderbolt, a gigantic messenger of death which reduced to ashes the entire race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable. Their hair and nails fell out; pottery broke without any apparent cause, and the birds turned white. After a few hours, all foodstuffs were infected. The thunderbolt was reduced to a fine dust.”</strong><span>(p. 122)</span><br/></blockquote>

<div><p>According to a Google Book and scholarly database search, the spelling “Mausola Purva” turns up nowhere before the 1963 English translation of the <em>Morning of the Magicians</em>, and all later references with that spelling derive from later writers copying that book without checking the source. The conventional spelling since at least 1807 is Mausala Parva, and it is the sixteenth parva, or division, of the <em>Mahabharata</em>, which one would not know from reading <em>Morning</em>. Similarly, “Curka” is a misspelling of Sakra, another name for Indra, a misspelling found only in <em>Morning </em>and its derivatives. The misspelling occurred because nineteenth century French translations of the <em>Mahabharata</em> transliterated Sakra as Çakra, with the c-cedilla (Ç) having the sound of an “S.” Pauwels and Bergier, or their publisher, mistakenly dropped the cedilla (the small hook) from the Ç, and misread the “a” as a “u.” This error appears in both the 1960 French edition and the 1963 English translation.</p></div>

<blockquote><span>Gurkha, flying a swift and powerful vimana,</span></blockquote>

<div><p>Somehow the god Sakra, mistakenly called “Cukra” in <em>Morning,</em> has now become “Gurkha,” the name of a Nepalese tribe. This, in turn occurred because Erich von Däniken,** or his publisher, mistakenly transliterated Cukra as Gurkha in the German edition of <em>Chariots of the Gods? </em>when summarizing Pauwels and Bergier, possibly due to misreading the word as a French rendering of the famed Nepalese military unites, the Gurkhas. The mistake was carried over into the English edition: “In the same book [the <em>Mahabharata</em>], in what is perhaps the first account of the dropping of an H bomb, it says that Gurkha loosed a single projectile on the triple city from a mighty Vimana.”</p></div>

<blockquote><strong>When the next day came, Camva actually brought forth an iron bolt through which all the individuals in the race of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas became consumed into ashes. Indeed, for the destruction of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, Camva brought forth, through that curse, a fierce iron bolt that looked like a gigantic messenger of death. The fact was duly reported to the king. In great distress of mind, the king (Ugrasena) caused that iron bolt to be reduced into fine powder. </strong><span>(Mausala Parva, sec. 1)</span></blockquote>

<div><p>Note that the supposed “bomb” is actually a bolt (like a scepter), that the king feared the bolt, and the king <em>destroyed it before it could be used.</em></p></div>

<blockquote><strong>Day by day strong winds blew, and many were the evil omens that arose, awful and foreboding the destruction of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas. The streets swarmed with rats and mice. Earthen pots showed cracks or broken from no apparent cause. At night, the rats and mice ate away the hair and nails of slumbering men. […] That chastiser of foes commanded the Vrishnis to make a pilgrimage to some sacred water. The messengers forthwith proclaimed at the command of Kecava that the Vrishnis should make a journey to the sea-coast for bathing in the sacred waters of the ocean.</strong> <span>(Mausala Parva, sec. 2)</span></blockquote>

<div><p>This destruction, incidentally, happens <em>three decades </em>after the destruction of the iron bolt, when the Vrishnis and Andhakas (and I am not making this up) killed each other by beating one another with pots and pans. Not exactly a nuclear bomb. Note that the supposed effect of radiation poisoning recorded in the Pauwels/Bergier/Berlitz/Childress text, the loss of nails, is a complete fabrication. In the original <em>mice and rats</em> ate the nails. Again, hardly a nuclear bomb.</p></div>

<blockquote><strong>While the worlds were thus afflicted, Sakra, surrounded by the Maruts, battled against the three cities by hurling his thunder upon them from every side. When, however, Purandra failed to pierce those cities made impenetrable, O king, by the Creator with his boons, the chief of celestials, filled with fear, and leaving those cities, repaired with those very gods to that chastiser of foes, viz., the Grandsire, for representing unto him the oppressions committed by the Asuras. […] </strong>(Section 33)</blockquote>

<div><p>  Note that Maheswara (Siva), not Sakra (or Cukra or Gurkha), is the driver of the car in the original; and also note that it is the Asuras (evil gods), not the Vrishnis who are the subject of these weapons. Note, too, just how much text it took Pauwels and Bergier to find a half-dozen lines they could string together to supposedly show nuclear weapons. </p></div>
