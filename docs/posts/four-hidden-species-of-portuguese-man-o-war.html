    <h1>Four Hidden Species of Portuguese Man-O&#39;-War</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>Let’s start with the toxic, venomous freak of nature:  the Portuguese man-o’-war.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.visitfyldecoast.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/portuguese-man-of-war-wikipedia-1.jpg" alt="Have you ever seen a Portuguese Man o&#39;War? – Visit Fylde Coast" width="451" height="253"/></p>
<p>The technical term for this is “cryptic diversity”.  It happens a lot, especially with species that aren’t well studied.  It’s biology, yeah?  Look closely, and everything turns out to be more complicated.</p>
<p>This is <em>Nomeus gronovii</em>, the bluebottle fish.  And it’s a parasite on the Portuguese man-o’-war.</p>
<p>The bluebottle survives among the tentacles by being small and very nimble.  It has actually evolved extra vertebrae so that it can twist and weave better!  But at some point, it simply grows too big.  So, only juvenile bluebottles live as parasites.  When they reach a certain size, they swim off and… uhh, we’re not sure, actually.  They seem to be demersal (bottom dwellers) because they turn up in trawl nets sometimes.  But how they live, how they mate, what they eat and what eats them… we have only the vaguest idea.  As far as I can tell, the last paper specifically studying <em>Nomeus gronovii </em>came out in 1983.  Nobody seems to be working on this right now.</p>
