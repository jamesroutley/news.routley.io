    <h1>Ask HN: What less-popular systems programming language are you using?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Less popular or less commonly used ones.</p><p>By that, I mean, not including the usual suspects, such as C, C++, Rust and Go (I know the controversy about the last one being a systems programming language or not).</p><p>I&#39;m asking this because I used C for both application programming and systems programming, early in my career, before I moved to using other languages such as Java and Python.</p><p>And of late, I&#39;ve been wanting to get back to doing some systems programming, but preferably in a more modern language (than C) which is meant for that.</p></div></div></div>
