<p><span data-contrast="auto">We recently notified you that an unauthorized party gained access to a third-party cloud-based storage service, which LastPass uses to store archived backups of our production data. In keeping with our commitment to transparency, we want to provide you with an update regarding our ongoing investigation.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:6,&#34;335551620&#34;:6,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">Based on our investigation to date, we have learned that an unknown threat actor accessed a cloud-based storage environment leveraging information obtained from the incident we previously disclosed in August of 2022. While no customer data was accessed during the August 2022 incident, some source code and technical information were stolen from our development environment and used to target another employee, obtaining credentials and keys which were used to access and decrypt some storage volumes within the cloud-based storage service.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:6,&#34;335551620&#34;:6,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">LastPass production services currently operate from on-premises data centers with cloud-based storage used for various purposes such as storing backups and regional data residency requirements. The cloud storage service accessed by the threat actor is physically separate from our production environment. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:6,&#34;335551620&#34;:6,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To date, we have determined that once the cloud storage access key and dual storage container decryption keys were obtained, the threat actor copied information from backup that contained basic customer account information and related metadata including company names, end-user names, billing addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, and the IP addresses from which customers were accessing the LastPass service. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:6,&#34;335551620&#34;:6,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The threat actor was also able to copy a backup of customer vault data from the encrypted storage container which is stored in a proprietary binary format that contains both unencrypted data, such as website URLs, as well as fully-encrypted sensitive fields such as website usernames and passwords, secure notes, and form-filled data. </span><b><span data-contrast="auto">These encrypted fields remain secured with 256-bit AES encryption and can only be decrypted with a unique encryption key derived from each user’s master password using our Zero Knowledge architecture. As a reminder, the master password is never known to LastPass and is not stored or maintained by LastPass.</span></b><span data-contrast="auto"> The encryption and decryption of data is performed only on the local LastPass client. For more information about our Zero Knowledge architecture and encryption algorithms, please see </span><a href="https://www.lastpass.com/security/zero-knowledge-security"><span data-contrast="auto">here.</span></a><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:6,&#34;335551620&#34;:6,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">There is no evidence that any unencrypted credit card data was accessed. LastPass does not store complete credit card numbers and credit card information is not archived in this cloud storage environment.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:6,&#34;335551620&#34;:6,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">The threat actor may attempt to use brute force to guess your master password and decrypt the copies of vault data they took. Because of the hashing and encryption methods we use to protect our customers, it would be extremely difficult to attempt to brute force guess master passwords for those customers who follow our password </span><a href="https://support.lastpass.com/help/what-is-the-lastpass-master-password-lp070014"><span data-contrast="none">best practices</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">If you use the default settings above, it would take millions of years to guess your master password using generally-available password-cracking technology.

<p><b><span data-contrast="auto">However, it is important to note that if your master password does not make use of the defaults above, then it would significantly reduce the number of attempts needed to guess it correctly.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">For those Business customers who have implemented LastPass Federated Login Services, LastPass maintains our Zero Knowledge architecture and implements a hidden master password to encrypt your vault data. Depending upon the chosen implementation model, this hidden master password is actually a combination of two or more separately-stored, 256 bits or 32 characters long cryptographically-generated random strings that must be specifically combined to use (you can read more about this in our Technical Whitepaper </span><a href="https://support.lastpass.com/download/lastpass-technical-whitepaper"><span data-contrast="auto">here</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">)</span><span data-contrast="auto">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:6,&#34;335551620&#34;:6,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The threat actor did not have access to the key fragments stored in customer Identity Provider’s or LastPass’ infrastructure and they were not included in the backups that were copied that contained customer vaults. Therefore, if you have implemented the Federated Login Services, you do not need to take any additional actions. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:6,&#34;335551620&#34;:6,&#34;335559739&#34;:160,&#34;335559740&#34;:259}"> </span></p>

<p><span data-contrast="auto">In response to the August 2022 incident, we eradicated any further potential access to the LastPass development environment by decommissioning that environment in its entirety and rebuilding a new environment from scratch. We also replaced and further hardened developer machines, processes, and authentication mechanisms. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;201341983&#34;:0,&#34;335551550&#34;:6,&#34;335551620&#34;:6,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0,&#34;335559740&#34;:240}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We have added additional logging and alerting capabilities to help detect any further unauthorized activity including a second line of defense with a leading managed endpoint detection and response vendor to supplement our own team.

<p><span data-contrast="auto">On August 25</span><span data-contrast="auto">th</span><span data-contrast="auto">, 2022, </span><span data-contrast="auto">we notified you about a security incident that was limited to the LastPass Development environment in which some of our source code and technical information was taken</span><span data-contrast="auto">. I wanted to update you on the conclusion of our investigation to provide transparency and peace-of-mind to our consumer and business communities.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We have completed the investigation and forensics process in partnership with Mandiant. Our investigation revealed that the threat actor’s activity was limited to a four-day period in August 2022. During this timeframe, the LastPass security team detected the threat actor’s activity and </span><span data-contrast="none">then contained the incident.  </span><span data-contrast="auto">There is no evidence of any threat actor activity beyond the established timeline. We can also confirm that there is no evidence that this incident involved any access to customer data or encrypted password vaults.   </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Our investigation determined that the threat actor gained access to the Development environment using a developer’s compromised endpoint</span><span data-contrast="none">. </span><span data-contrast="auto">While the method used for the initial endpoint compromise is inconclusive, the </span><span data-contrast="none">threat actor utilized their persistent access to impersonate the developer once </span><span data-contrast="auto">the developer </span><span data-contrast="none">had successfully authenticated using multi-factor authentication. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Although the threat actor was able to access the Development environment, our system design and controls prevented the threat actor from accessing any customer data or </span><span data-contrast="auto">encrypted password vaults</span><span data-contrast="none">. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Firstly, the LastPass Development environment is physically separated from, and has no direct connectivity to, our Production environment. Secondly the Development environment does not contain any customer data or encrypted vaults.  Thirdly, LastPass does not have any access to the master passwords of our customers’ vaults – without the master password, it is not possible for anyone other than the owner of a vault to decrypt vault data as part of our Zero Knowledge security model. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&#34;134233117&#34;:false,&#34;134233118&#34;:false,&#34;335559738&#34;:0,&#34;335559739&#34;:0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">In order to validate code integrity, we conducted an analysis of our source code and production builds and confirm that we see no evidence of attempts of code-poisoning or malicious code injection. </span><span data-contrast="none">Developers do not have the </span><span data-contrast="auto">ability to push </span><span data-contrast="none">source code from the Development environment into Production.
