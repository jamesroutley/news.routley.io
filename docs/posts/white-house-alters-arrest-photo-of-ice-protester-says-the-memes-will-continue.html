<p>Protesters <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=1389002139370676">disrupted services</a> on Sunday at the Cities Church in St. Paul, chanting “ICE OUT” and “Justice for Renee Good.” The St. Paul Pioneer Press <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/19/st-paul-cities-church-protest-doj/">quoted Levy Armstrong</a> as saying, “When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents is almost unfathomable to me.”</p>
<p>The church <a href="https://www.citieschurch.com/leadership">website</a> lists David Easterwood as one of its pastors. Protesters said this is the same David Easterwood who is listed as a defendant in a lawsuit that Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison filed against Noem and other federal officials. The <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2026/docs/00190_DHS_Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> lists Easterwood as a defendant “in his official capacity as Acting Director, Saint Paul Field Office, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”</p>
<p>Levy Armstrong, who is also a former president of the NAACP’s Minneapolis branch, was arrested yesterday morning. Announcing the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href="https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2014344323706302566">wrote</a>, “WE DO NOT TOLERATE ATTACKS ON PLACES OF WORSHIP.” Bondi alleged that Levy Armstrong “played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota.”</p>

<h2>Multiple arrests</h2>
<p>Noem said Levy Armstrong “is being charged with a federal crime under 18 USC 241,” which <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/241">prohibits</a> “conspir[ing] to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.”</p>
<p>“Religious freedom is the bedrock of the United States—there is no first amendment right to obstruct someone from practicing their religion,” Noem wrote.</p>
<p>St. Paul School Board member Chauntyll Allen was also arrested. Attorneys for the Cities Church issued <a href="https://truenorthlegal.org/news/cities-church-attorneys-at-true-north-legal-respond-to-department-of-justice-action">statements</a> supporting the arrests and saying they “are exploring all legal options to protect the church and prevent further invasions.”</p>
<p>A federal magistrate judge initially ruled that Levy Armstrong and Allen could be released, but they were still being held last night after the government “made a motion to stay the release for further review, claiming they might be flight risks,” the Pioneer Press <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/22/the-woman-who-led-a-protest-at-a-minnesota-church-service-has-been-arrested-bondi-says/">wrote</a>.</p>
