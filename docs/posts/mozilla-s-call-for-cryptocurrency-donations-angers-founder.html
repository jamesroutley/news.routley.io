    <h1>Mozilla&#39;s call for cryptocurrency donations angers founder</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A few days ago, Mozilla Foundation invited netizens on Twitter to send in cryptocurrency donations via a new payment service provider.</p>
<p>This move by the Firefox browser maker <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/mozilla/status/1476951030638260225">rapidly drew</a> criticism, including that from Jamie Zawinski – who <a href="https://www.davetitus.com/mozilla/">named</a> the Mozilla project and was one of the original Netscape <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/11/watch-a-vc-use-my-name-to-sell-a-con/">developers</a>.</p>
<p>You can read the blistering thread <a rel="nofollow" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jwz/status/1478022085737803776">here</a> yourself; it gives short shrift to the concept of using cryptocurrencies. Zawinski described the payment processor and digital coins as &#34;planet incinerating.&#34;</p>

    

<p>&#34;Hi, I&#39;m sure that whoever runs [Mozilla&#39;s Twitter] account has no idea who I am, but I founded @mozilla and I&#39;m here to say fuck you and fuck this,&#34; Zawinski wrote, adding that &#34;everyone involved in the project should be witheringly ashamed of this decision.&#34;</p>

        


        

<p>Billy Markus, who co-created Dogecoin, one of the crypto-coins accepted by Mozilla, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1478738029405618176?s=20">observed</a> in response to the general condemnation: &#34;Reading the comments in this thread, as much as I rag on crypto-bros being counterproductive at marketing, the vitriolic, hateful, hyperbolic, hypocritical, sanctimonious whining coming from the anti-crypto people is 1,000x more insufferable than the pro-crypto people.&#34;</p>
<p>As recently as September, Moz&#39;s web-standards lead Tantek Çelik <a rel="nofollow" href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2021Sep/0000.html">slammed</a> cryptocurrencies as being unsustainable, stating:</p>

<p>The Bitcoin-loving <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/laser-eyes-crypto">laser-eye</a> brigade were predictably <a rel="nofollow" href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/mozilla-vs-bitcoin">unhappy</a> with Çelik&#39;s observations.</p>
<p>Zawinski, aka JWZ, who named the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html">CADT model</a> of software development and has a <a href="https://www.jwz.org/blog/tag/dunning-krugerrands/">Dunning-Krugerrands</a> tag on his blog for crypto-cash-related posts, is a reliable source of insight and pithy quotes, such as: &#34;Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &#39;I know, I&#39;ll use regular expressions.&#39; Now they have two problems.&#34;</p>

        

<p>Another gem? &#34;[Perl] combines all the worst aspects of C and Lisp: a billion different sublanguages in one monolithic executable. It combines the power of C with the readability of PostScript.&#34;</p>

<p>Mozilla has accepted crypto-coin <a rel="nofollow" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Donate_Bitcoin&amp;oldid=1105674">donations</a> for years, perhaps as part of its <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/04/waterfox_firefox_fork/">long-ongoing</a> efforts to alienate its own users: it&#39;s only the payment provider that changed lately, it seems.</p>
<p>When we approached Zawinski for comment, he said he was &#34;actually far <i>more</i> depressed at the fact that the Long Now Foundation and Internet Archive have bought into this scam [<i>cryptocurrencies – ed.</i>] than that Mozilla has. Because while at this point Mozilla is a largely rudderless privacy-focused advocacy organization instead of a software project, the Long Now Foundation is putatively all about long-term thinking.&#34;</p>
<p>He added that there was &#34;literally nothing in the modern tech ecosystem more short-sighted than the gambling instrument and ecological disaster that we know as cryptocurrencies.&#34;</p>
<p>We&#39;ve asked Mozilla for comment. ®</p>
