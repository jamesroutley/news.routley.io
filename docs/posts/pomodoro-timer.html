          Pomofocus is a customizable pomodoro timer that works on
          desktop &amp; mobile browser. The aim of this app is to help you
          focus on any task you are working on, such as study,
          writing, or coding. This app is inspired by
          <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pomodoro Technique</a>
          which is a time management method developed by Francesco
          Cirillo.

          The Pomodoro Technique is created by Francesco Cirillo for a
          more productive way to work and study. The technique uses a
          timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25
          minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval
          is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for &#39;tomato&#39;,
          after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a
          university student. -
