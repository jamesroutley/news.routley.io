I&#39;ve been having a repeated conversation lately, where somebody complains to me
about YouTube and my internal response is &#34;it doesn&#39;t have to be like that!&#34;
With a few browser extensions, you can reliably bypass many of the most common
complaints about YouTube and enjoy your video time much better. I&#39;ll show you
how.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-1">

Your browser is your <em>User Agent</em>
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1">
<p>
The web browser is software that you own and control. Firefox, Chrome, and their
various alternatives are mostly open source software that support powerful
modifications in the form of browser extensions.</p>
<p>
The web does not belong to the companies and brands that publish there. They put
a website out there, you download it, and what happens from there is <em>nobody
else&#39;s business.</em> If there&#39;s something you don&#39;t like about a website, like the
font, visual layout, or a barrage of ads, you can use a browser extension to
change the website so that it fits your needs and respects your space.</p>
<p>
Let&#39;s apply this to YouTube, in the context of the complaints I hear most
commonly.</p>

Top YouTube Complaints
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2">
<ol>
<li>The <em>algorithm</em> is trying to push something I&#39;m not interested in

Much of the visual real estate in stock YouTube is given to algorithmic
discovery of video, and they push it on you constantly. What&#39;s worse, it can
get the idea for whatever arbitrary reason that you&#39;re interested in some
particular type of content, and then you&#39;re seeing invitations for that
constantly, without a clear way to prioritize the channels and topics that
you&#39;ve actually subscribed to.</li>
<li>Non-stop barrage of advertisements

YouTube shows ads every few minutes and often at the start and end of a
video. It&#39;s overwhelming, and the companies putting out these ads are not
good faith actors. They want to get you addicted, in debt, and miserable.
Cutting off their ability to push their content in front of you is critical
self-care.</li>
<li>YouTube creators tend to waste your time

From clickbait video titles to sponsored ad reads and constant reminders to
like and subscribe, the average YouTube video is full of anti-patterns that
degrade the watching experience in service of <em>the algorithm.</em></li>
</ol>

Browser Extensions to Tame YouTube
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3">
<p>
Here&#39;s my list of extensions I use, and how each one contributes to a good experience:</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-4">
<h4 id="headline-4">
DeArrow
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4">
<p><a href="https://dearrow.ajay.app/">https://dearrow.ajay.app/</a></p>
<p>
DeArrow has a mission to &#34;make titles accurate and reduce sensationalism. No
more arrows, ridiculous faces, and no more clickbait.&#34; It replaces the gimmicky
thumbnail preview images and the attention-baiting video titles with an actual
representative still frame from the video and a crowd-sourced title, suggested
by one of your fellow viewers. This makes it easier to tell whether you&#39;re
interested in a video before you click and signal to the algorithm that you want
to see more similar content.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-5">
<h4 id="headline-5">
SponsorBlock
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5">
<p><a href="https://sponsor.ajay.app/">https://sponsor.ajay.app/</a></p>
<p>
From the same author as DeArrow, SponsorBlock seamlessly skips over segments of
the video which contain a sponsored ad read. The video skips the minimal amount
so that you don&#39;t miss any content. Optionally, you can also auto-skip animated
intro segments, reminders to like and subscribe, and <a href="https://wiki.sponsor.ajay.app/w/Guidelines">other categories</a> of content
that some viewers find low-value.</p>
<p>
This doesn&#39;t analyze video in real-time to detect sponsored ad reads. It&#39;s based
on data submitted by other users. So if you&#39;re watching a fresh upload, or you
enjoy some niche creators, you might have the opportunity to submit timestamps
for segments to be skipped for the benefit of other users.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-6">
<h4 id="headline-6">
uBlock Origin
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6">
<p><a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">https://ublockorigin.com/</a></p>
<p>
Indispensable for browsing the web, uBlock Origin blocks advertisements on
YouTube and many other websites. This saves you time and Internet bandwidth,
reduces the browser&#39;s memory consumption, and protects your peace.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7">
<h4 id="headline-7">
Unhook
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7">
<p><a href="https://unhook.app/">https://unhook.app/</a></p>
<p>
The Unhook extension gives you the option to remove YouTube features that you&#39;d
rather live without, such as related videos, YouTube Shorts, live chats, the
suggested video wall, and many more. You can even remove YouTube comments
entirely if you don&#39;t enjoy reading them. I personally hate those &#34;end screen
cards&#34; which appear over the final seconds of the video and link you to more
videos. It just encourages you to keep zombie-watching instead of moving on to
something more valuable. Unhook made it easy to turn those off.</p>

Advanced YouTube tinkering: Enhancer for YouTube
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8">
<p><a href="https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube">https://www.mrfdev.com/enhancer-for-youtube</a></p>
<p>
This extension gives you the ability to fiddle with every part of the YouTube
platform, such as choosing which codecs and frame rate you want to use, setting
exact playback speed outside the bounds of what options YouTube usually offers,
and much more. If there&#39;s some small thing about YouTube that bugs you and isn&#39;t
covered by the other extensions, it&#39;s likely that this one can help you out with
some futzing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-9">
<h4 id="headline-9">
Wait, but does it work on mobile?
</h4>
<p>
On Android, Google Chrome doesn&#39;t support extensions. But Firefox does! <a href="https://www.firefox.com/en-US/browsers/mobile/android/">Switch
to mobile Firefox</a> and enjoy superior browsing, including all the extensions above.</p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-10">
<p>
Your video player should respect you. That&#39;s not too much to ask for. It&#39;s a shame
that YouTube (and parent company Google) are so disrespectful, but at least for
the time being we still live in an era where we control our own web browsers and
can modify disrespectful websites to force them to behave.</p>
<p>
Take the opportunity. A better world is, in this specific instance, only a few
button clicks away.</p>
