    <h1>More Subprime Borrowers Are Missing Loan Payments</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
         <p>Consumers with low credit scores are falling behind on payments for car loans, personal loans and credit cards, a sign that the healthiest consumer lending environment on record in the U.S. is coming to an end.</p>
         <p>The share of subprime credit cards and personal loans that are at least 60 days late is rising faster than normal, according to credit-reporting firm  Equifax Inc.  In March, those delinquencies rose month over month for the eighth time in a row, nearing their prepandemic levels.</p>
