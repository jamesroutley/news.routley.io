patent clerk in Bern who received a disappointing annual performance review in

<h3>E.W. DIJKSTRA</h3>

<p><b>&#34;Goto Statement Considered Harmful.&#34;</b> This paper tries to
convince us that the well-known goto statement should be eliminated from our
programming languages or, at least (since I don&#39;t think that it will ever be
eliminated), that programmers should not use it. It is not clear what should
replace it. The paper doesn&#39;t explain to us what would be the use of the
&#34;if&#34; statement without a &#34;goto&#34; to redirect the flow of
execution: Should all our postconditions consist of a single statement, or
should we only use the arithmetic &#34;if,&#34; which doesn&#39;t contain the
offensive &#34;goto&#34;?</p>

<h3>E.F. CODD</h3>

<p><b>&#34;A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.&#34;</b>
This paper proposes that all data in a database be represented in the form of
relations—sets of tuples—and that all the operations relative to
data access be made on this model. Some of the ideas presented in the paper are
interesting and may be of some use, but, in general, this very preliminary work
fails to make a convincing point as to their implementation, performance, and
practical usefulness. The paper?s general point is that the tabular form
presented should be suitable for general data access, but I see two problems
with this statement: expressivity and efficiency.</p>

<h3>A. TURING</h3>

<p><b>&#34;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungs
Problem.&#34;</b> This is a bizarre paper. It begins by defining a computing
device absolutely unlike anything I have seen, then proceeds to show—I
haven&#39;t quite followed the needlessly complicated formalism—that there
are numbers that it can&#39;t compute. As I see it, there are two alternatives that
apply to any machine that will ever be built: Either these numbers are too big
to be represented in the machine, in which case the conclusion is obvious, or
they are not; in that case, a machine that can&#39;t compute them is simply
broken!</p>

<h3>C.E. SHANNON</h3>

<p><b>&#34;A Mathematical Theory of Communication.&#34;</b> This paper is
poorly motivated and excessively abstract. It is unclear for what practical
problem it might be relevant. The author claims that &#34;semantic aspects of
communication are irrelevant to the engineering problems,&#34; which seems to
indicate that his theory is suitable mostly for transmitting gibberish. Alas,
people will not pay to have gibberish transmitted anywhere.</p>

<h3>C.A.R. HOARE</h3>

<p><b>&#34;An Axiomatic Basis for Computer Programming.&#34;</b> I am not sure
I understand this article. It claims to be about programming, but it doesn&#39;t
contain a single line of code.</p>

<h3>R.L. RIVEST, A. SHAMIR, AND L. ADELMAN</h3>

<p><b>&#34;A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key
Cryptosystems.&#34;</b> According to the (very short) introduction, this paper
purports to present a practical implementation of Diffie and Hellman&#39;s
public-key cryptosystem for applications in the electronic mail realm. If this
is indeed the premise, the paper should be rejected both for a failure to live
up to it and for its irrelevance.</p>

<p>Further, as the authors acknowledge, a data encryption standard already
exists, supported by both the US National Bureau of Standards and IBM,
currently the largest computer manufacturer. It is unlikely that any method
that runs counter to this standard will be adopted in any significant degree.
True, the IBM method presents the problem of distributing the encryption key,
but their method is a standard and we must live with it. Instead of creating
nonstandard methods that will soon be dead for lack of users, the authors
should try to extend the standard and devise ways to distribute the encryption
keys securely.</p>
