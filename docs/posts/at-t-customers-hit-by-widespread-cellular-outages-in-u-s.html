We encourage the use of Wi-Fi calling until service is restored,” the company said.</p><p>On X, the company has been responding to customers reporting cell service issues across the country.</p><p>Verizon said Thursday morning that the outages are not affecting their network directly, only customers trying to reach another carrier. </p><p>T-Mobile also said early Thursday that the network didn&#39;t suffer an outage and is operating normally, and Downdetector numbers likely reflect customers attempting to reach users on other networks. </p><p>The outages pose a concern as some people may be unable to call 911 in the case of an emergency. </p><p>San Francisco’s Fire Department <a href="https://twitter.com/SFFDPIO/status/1760618741422072177" target="_blank">said on X</a> that it was aware of an issue affecting AT&amp;T wireless customers from making and receiving phone calls, including 911. </p><p>“The San Francisco 911 center is still operational,” the office said. “If you are an AT&amp;T customer and cannot get through to 911, then please try calling from a landline. If that is not an option then please try to get ahold of a friend or family member who is a customer of a different carrier and ask them to call 911 on your behalf.”</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://twitter.com/ChicagoOEMC/status/1760652962077032706" target="_blank">Chicago&#39;s Office of Emergency Management &amp; Communications</a>, Virginia’s <a href="https://twitter.com/PWCPolice/status/1760639009582367221" target="_blank">Prince William County police department </a>and North Carolina’s <a href="https://twitter.com/CMPD/status/1760624126467981629" target="_blank">Charlotte-Mecklenburg police department </a>have issued warnings on X alerting the public about the outage while acknowledging some customers were briefly unable to contact 911. </p><p>Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said in a statement that the city is gathering information to assist in resolving the issue. </p><p>“Atlanta’s e-911 is able to receive inbound and make outbound calls. We have received calls from AT&amp;T customers that their cellular phones are in SOS mode,” Dickens said. </p><p><em>This is a developing story.
