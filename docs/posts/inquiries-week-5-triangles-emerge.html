    <h1>Inquiries-Week 5: Triangles Emerge</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2><p>In this inquiry, nodes are connected one at a time. How many lines can you draw before a triangle emerges?</p><h3 id="starting-with-four">Starting with Four</h3><p>Let&#39;s start with four nodes - draw them on a sheet of paper. How many lines (called edges) can you draw before a triangle forms with each vertex on a node? (Don&#39;t count triangles that don&#39;t have vertices on a node).</p><figure><img src="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/10/image-26.png" alt="4 points, labeled 0,1,2,3 with 0 on the top, then filled in clockwise." loading="lazy" width="1094" height="1006" srcset="https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/image-26.png 600w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/10/image-26.png 1000w, https://www.fractalkitty.com/content/images/2025/10/image-26.png 1094w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>What is the fewest number of edges you can draw before there <strong>has to</strong> be a triangle? What is the largest number of edges you can draw before there <strong>has to</strong> be a triangle?</p><h3 id="more-numbers">More Numbers</h3><p>Now, play with graphs that have 6, 8, and 10 nodes. There is a tool below. You can either start with all lines and remove some of them, or add lines. Paper works as well.</p>

<h3 id="activity">Activity</h3><ul><li>Play with adding edges in different ways. Look at even and odd numbers of nodes. Examine symmetrical and randomly generated graphs. </li><li>Is there a strategy to maximize or minimize the number of edges you can fit without any triangles emerging?</li><li>What patterns do you notice? What conjectures can you form from your observations and play?</li><li>What other questions can you pose?</li></ul><p>This is a 60+ minute activity. </p><h3 id="exploration-phase-15-30-minutes"><strong>Exploration Phase (15-30 minutes)</strong></h3><p><strong>Playing with a 6-node graph</strong></p><p>Explore a 6-node graph and see what the maximum number of lines is possible without any triangles. Some of the ways learners may approach this:</p><ul><li>Whiteboard group work (virtual or in person)</li><li>Using the <a href="https://inquiries.link/tools/graph-theory/triangles-emerge/full" rel="noreferrer">interactive tool</a> and taking screenshots to share</li><li>Paper and pencil</li><li>No graph - how could you restate the problem and work it without a graph?</li><li>Build a spreadsheet of observations.</li></ul><p>If learners find 9 lines are possible, then try a 4-node graph to note that 4 lines are possible.</p><p>Then try 8 nodes. </p><ul><li>Some may get 12 for an 8-node graph, but more are possible. Here are some questions to help:<ul><li>How do you know that this way of drawing maximizes the number of lines possible?</li><li>What is the smallest number of lines for each graph we&#39;ve looked at? This might tell us how not to draw it.</li><li>If two nodes are connected, what can we say about what other nodes they can connect to? (They can&#39;t both connect to the same node.)</li><li>Splitting the graph into two colors and connecting with different rules that way (only red to blue, or blue to blue, or ...). Be cautious with this nudge - it may reveal too much. Even and odd-numbered nodes also work for this.</li></ul></li></ul><h3 id="conjecture-formation-15-30-minutes"><strong>Conjecture Formation (15-30 minutes)</strong></h3><p>Allow time to write down observations and form conjectures using the even node graphs as a starting point. Give examples of conjectures, if needed, that don&#39;t give away discoveries.</p><p>The table below shows just how many patterns may emerge from adding, subtracting, and playing with the different columns (It&#39;s fun to discover, so the table is just for reference as a facilitator)</p><table>

<p><strong>Possible Conjectures (these are just a few):</strong></p><blockquote>&#34;The number of maximum lines for an even number of nodes is (n/2)(n/2).&#34;</blockquote><blockquote>&#34;The number of maximum lines for an odd number of nodes is (n+1)(n-1)/4.&#34;</blockquote><blockquote>The number of maximum lines to not form a triangle is the number of possible lines minus the (n-1) graph&#39;s maximum number of lines to not form a triangle. </blockquote><blockquote>&#34;Starting with a 3-node graph, the maximum number of lines that don&#39;t form a triangle is {2,4,6,9,12,16,20,...}, where there is adding in the pattern {+2,+2,+3,+3,+4,+4,...}.&#34;</blockquote><blockquote>&#34;For even node graphs, the maximum number of lines is a square number.&#34;</blockquote><blockquote>&#34;The worst way to draw a graph is to connect all of the nodes to a single node.&#34;</blockquote><blockquote>&#34;The best way to draw a graph is to connect all even nodes to odd nodes, and not even to even or odd to odd.&#34;</blockquote><p>Other conjectures related to colorings, such as what makes a cycle of 4, and more, can emerge - go with the flow to see what is discovered.</p><h3 id="discussion-10-20-minutes"><strong>Discussion (10-20 minutes)</strong></h3><p>Share and discuss conjectures, observations, and strategies.</p><p>What patterns emerged? What other strategies or approaches were taken?</p><p>Create a table or document to record observations in various ways. </p><p>Look at all the graphs created! Do any insights emerge when seeing other peoples approaches?</p><h3 id="optional-extensionstry-a-proof-or-variation">Optional Extensions - try a proof or variation</h3><p>Numerous conjectures and observations can arise from this activity; only one proof outline is below. Learners may also find that spending more time in the pattern-finding space suits them well for this activity. Instead of proofs, variations and games can be played with the graphs (don&#39;t make 4, nim-like turns of drawing lines (Sim), colorings, and more). </p><p> One approach is to split the nodes into two groups and make a bipartite graph, where each group can connect to the other, but not to itself. <br/></p><p><strong>Proof-1</strong>: A graph with even nodes can have a maximum of (n² - 1)/4 edges without forming any triangles. </p><ol><li>A triangle forms when two connected nodes both connect to a third node.</li><li>To avoid triangles, split all nodes into two groups (A and B) and only connect nodes between groups, never within a group.</li></ol><ul><ul><li>This prevents triangles because any two connected nodes are in different groups, so that no third node can connect to both.</li></ul></ul><ol start="3"><li>If Group A has k nodes and Group B has (n - k) nodes, the number of edges is k(n - k).</li></ol><ul><ul><li>Or said another way: An edge connects exactly one node from Group A to exactly one node from Group B, so counting all possible pairs gives k(n - k) edges.</li></ul></ul><ol start="4"><li>When k = 1, there are n - 1 edges.
