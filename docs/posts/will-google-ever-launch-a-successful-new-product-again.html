    <h1>Ask HN: Will Google Ever Launch a Successful New Product Again?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Because I&#39;m struggling to think of anything in recent years, and most of the things they do try to launch tend to flop, even if the initial idea is pretty good.</p><p>Meanwhile, all their successful products and services have been around a while now. Search was 1997, Blogger was 1999 (not initially by Google), Gmail was 2004, YouTube and Maps were both 2005, Google Docs was 2006 and both Android and Chrome were 2008. So where&#39;s the next big hit? Is one even possible with Google&#39;s attitude of &#34;if it doesn&#39;t succeed in a few months, kill it&#34;?</p><p>What is likely to be their next successful story out of the things they worked on recently?</p></div></div></div>
