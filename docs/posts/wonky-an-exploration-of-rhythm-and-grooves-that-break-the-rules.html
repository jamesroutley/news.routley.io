	<p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Sometimes straight can get a little boring. Fitting an evenly spaced grid is just one way to think about rhythm. Another is <strong>swing</strong>, where the second note within each beat is intentionally delayed. So, the first note takes up slightly more space, and the second beat takes slightly less than if they were evenly spaced. It’s a common feature of blues and jazz, and the whole band does it, all playing on this new long-short-long-short grid.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

	<p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Swing is defined by delaying that second note, but by how much exactly? The swing examples you just heard are called <strong>triplet swing</strong> because if we divide each beat in 3 parts (called triplets), the groove can be felt as the first and third of those triplets. Ordinarily, the beat would be divided into an even number of parts, and we could play two evenly spaced notes. Dividing the beat into an odd number of parts always results in an uneven feeling, since one note must be slightly longer than the other.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
		</p><p><img src="https://pudding.cool/2023/06/groove/assets/img/swing_diagram.png" alt="Diagram showing different ways of dividing a beat to create different levels of swing. If the beat is divided in three parts, the first and second note will not be evenly split, resulting in a swing feel."/>
		</p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What about other odd divisions? This song’s groove is a <strong>quintuplet swing</strong>, derived by dividing the beat into 5 parts and playing on the first and fourth subdivisions. It’s a subtle difference, but the swing is slightly less steep, it’s closer to straight than the triplet swing.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
		</p><div><div><p><strong>Sequence Start</strong> by Sungazer</p>

	
</div>
		</div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Let’s visualize this a different way. A rotation around this circle represents 1 beat. For a triplet swing, the beat is divided in 3 parts, and notes are played on the first and third, which is as close to even as we can get. Another way you can describe this rhythm is to say it has a 66.6% <strong>swing percentage</strong>, meaning that the first note takes up 66.6% of the beat. The higher the swing percentage, the steeper the swing, the further from straight (50% swing) we get.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->
		</p><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->Depending on how many pieces you divide the beat into, that second note is delayed a different amount. Each of these swings is subtly different, try them out for yourself.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

	</div><p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->As you divide the beat into more pieces, the rhythm inches closer to straight, but never quite reaching it. These grooves have a unique funkiness - caught between a swung and straight feel, they have a lilting, off-kilter feeling. To me it feels like we’re stumbling down a flight of stairs and never quite catching ourselves. This tension is signature to J Dilla’s style.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

	<p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->When most music is straight and even, we develop expectations of where notes should fall. Even a slight deviation can feel bizarre, but that bizarreness is what made J Dilla’s time-feel so compelling. Another technique he used was to <strong>shift</strong> an entire part over ever so slightly on his <a href="https://nmaahc.si.edu/object/nmaahc_2014.139.1" target="_blank">drum machine</a>. It results in this distinctive flam or rubbing effect between instruments that now fall slightly apart from each other.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

	<p><!-- HTML_TAG_START -->What made J Dilla truly groundbreaking was his fusion of these elements — straight, swung, shifted — giving different parts of the groove different time-feels and slight deviations. This creates the looseness, tension, and humanness that defines the innovative time-feel known as <strong>Dilla Time</strong>.<!-- HTML_TAG_END -->

	<div><div>
			<p>Let’s start by swinging the bass. This is called a quintuplet swing (see advanced swing section).</p>
			<p>We’ll actually leave the hi-hat and kick straight. A key feature of Dilla Time is the tension created by differing time-feels happening simultaneously. Now, shift the snare slightly earlier.</p>
