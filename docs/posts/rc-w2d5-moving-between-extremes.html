    <h1>RC W2D5 - Moving between extremes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_1946234">
    
      <div><p>There are times I’m stuck not knowing what to write about, and resign myself to the possibility that the post may end up being just a single paragraph that I forced myself to write. Then I start writing that paragraph and end up with a few paragraphs, and wonder how I resigned myself to writing just one.</p><p>Note to self: next time this happens, read up previous posts and see what comes up (especially since I tend to leave breadcrumbs around).</p><blockquote><p>At times I feel going into Haskell is escapism. Let&#39;s stick to it for a week and see where this goes.</p></blockquote><p>My plan for RC was to learn Haskell. I felt a little demotivated on <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/rc-w1d1-return-to-the-fold">Day 1</a> and resolved to try it out for at least a week (it&#39;s Week 2, I&#39;m still at it). I wondered whether learning Haskell was my form of escapism, since I have a tendency of moving between extremes. Previously I went all out learning about performance. Now I go all out learning about correctness. I start thinking about the possibility of working on correctness. I realize correctness is hard too. Existential crisis on Day 1 of RC.</p><p>I quoted Matt Klein <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/rc-w1d3-building-patience">previously</a> and I can see parallels here. Soft skills don’t come as naturally for me, so I decide to go hard into technical skills. Hard skills is hard too. It’s a good quote, so I’ll share it again here.</p><blockquote><p>One last thing: don&#39;t let anyone tell you that the tech/engineering is the easy part. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s hard. Soft skills are also hard. It&#39;s ALL hard, and both are required to succeed.</p></blockquote><p>It’s common that we swing between extremes. It’s a good thing that we honor the time we have in this world through dedication. However it does get complicated when that dedication itself becomes ingrained in one’s identity in such a way that it’s hard to take an honest look and wonder if we might be doing something for the wrong reasons.</p><p>OK not to play therapist here (perhaps a topic for a different day). I did recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKCmefQdplI">Stutz</a> to a friend recently, and she asked me if it was relatable. I said to watch the first 10 minutes, and if it’s not your thing now but becomes a thing 10 years down the road and you think about watching it again, that 10 minutes would be worth its weight in gold.</p></div>
