    <h1>Microsoft Copilot AI Comes to LG TVs, and Can&#39;t Be Deleted</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft&#39;s Copilot AI chatbot is arguably one of the most controversial add-ons ever implemented in the Windows 11 operating system. However, the controversy doesn&#39;t stop at PC operating systems. It seems to extend to TVs as well. According to Reddit user u/defjam16, his LG TV webOS received an update that installed Microsoft&#39;s Copilot AI app, with no option to remove it. Although users can choose to ignore it, the push for increased AI integration in everyday products is becoming unavoidable, even on TVs. What exactly can a Copilot AI app do in your TV? We don&#39;t know either.</p></div></div>
