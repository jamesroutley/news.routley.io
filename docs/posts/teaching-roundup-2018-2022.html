        <p>I just finished cleaning up some older course websites and (finally!) switching all my stuff to use HTTPS.  In honor of that, here’s a roundup of all the courses I’ve taught in the last four years.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In fall 2018, I designed and taught a grad seminar, <a href="https://decomposition.al/CMPS290S-2018-09/">“Languages and Abstractions for Distributed Programming”</a>.  My students and I wrote a group blog that got some <a href="https://twitter.com/kc_srk/status/1065539993672826880">praise</a>.  Here’s the <a href="https://decomposition.al/blog/2018/12/31/course-retrospective-languages-and-abstractions-for-distributed-programming/">retrospective blog post</a>.</li>
  <li>In fall 2019, at the start of my second year, I designed and taught another grad seminar, <a href="https://decomposition.al/CSE290Q-2019-09/">“SMT Solving and Solver-Aided Systems”</a>. This one has a <a href="https://decomposition.al/blog/2020/09/20/course-retrospective-smt-solving-and-solver-aided-systems/">retrospective blog post</a>, too.</li>
  <li>In winter 2020, I taught <a href="https://decomposition.al/CSE30-2020-01/">“Programming Abstractions: Python”</a>, an almost-introductory, kinda data-sciencey, Python course for undergrads.  The course design and most of the materials I used were based on ones created by my colleague <a href="https://luca.dealfaro.com/">Luca de Alfaro</a>.</li>
  <li>I’ve taught undergrad distributed systems four times: <a href="https://decomposition.al/CMPS128-2019-04/">spring 2019</a>, <a href="https://decomposition.al/CSE138-2020-03/">spring 2020</a>, <a href="https://decomposition.al/CSE138-2021-03/">spring 2021</a>, and <a href="https://decomposition.al/CSE138-2021-09/">fall 2021</a>.  I created my own materials for this course, based on my colleague <a href="https://people.ucsc.edu/~palvaro/">Peter Alvaro</a>’s course design.  The first time I taught the course, I had an optional zine-making project – check out the <a href="https://decomposition.al/CMPS128-2019-04/">delightful zines</a> my students made!  Here’s a <a href="https://decomposition.al/blog/2019/06/29/my-students-made-zines-and-so-can-yours/">blog post about the zine project</a>, which was inspired by <a href="https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~ctaylor/">Cynthia Taylor</a>’s <a href="https://twitter.com/pinkhairedcyn/status/599310967047061504">zine</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/pinkhairedcyn/status/674647900434137090">assignments</a> for her operating systems and networking courses.  Later, <a href="https://www.d.umn.edu/~pahp/">Pete Peterson</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/tastytronic/status/1186762575737954304">adopted the zine project idea for his infosec course</a>, and I eventually <a href="https://decomposition.al/blog/2022/01/31/career-building-reliable-distributed-systems-with-refinement-types/">incorporated the idea into my CAREER grant proposal</a>.</li>
  <li>In <a href="https://decomposition.al/CSE138-2020-03/">spring 2020</a> and <a href="https://decomposition.al/CSE138-2021-03/">spring 2021</a>, I taught my distributed systems course live on Twitch!  I blogged about <a href="https://decomposition.al/blog/2020/03/31/twitch-plays-cse138/">my streaming setup</a> and about <a href="https://decomposition.al/blog/2021/03/30/cse138-returns-to-twitch-today/">how it went</a>.  You can watch all my distributed systems lectures from 2020 and 2021 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/lindseykuperwithasharpie">on YouTube</a>, and I still answer people’s questions in YouTube comments pretty often.  Someday I’ll write up a FAQ.</li>
  <li>I’ve taught graduate distributed systems twice, in <a href="https://decomposition.al/CSE232-2020-10/">fall 2020</a> and <a href="https://decomposition.al/CSE232-2021-09">fall 2021</a>. Both times, I used a <a href="https://decomposition.al/CSE232-2021-09/course-overview.html#in-class-discussion-process">structured in-class discussion process</a> based on an approach developed by Norman Ramsey, Kathleen Fisher, and Matt Ahrens in their courses taught at Tufts.  My students created <a href="https://github.com/lkuper/CSE232-2020-10/wiki">public</a> <a href="https://github.com/lkuper/CSE232-2021-09/wiki">wikis</a> about the papers we read.</li>
  <li>Finally, in spring 2022 I taught <a href="https://ucsc-cse-114a.github.io/spring22/">undergrad programming languages</a> for the first time (!).  My colleague <a href="https://owenarden.github.io/home/">Owen Arden</a> designed this course, which is heavily inspired by PL courses taught by Ranjit Jhala and Nadia Polikarpova at UC San Diego.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that’s the last four years of teaching! In 2022-23, I’m scheduled to teach another grad seminar (maybe about distributed systems verification, but I’ll decide later) in winter, and undergrad PL again in spring.</p>
