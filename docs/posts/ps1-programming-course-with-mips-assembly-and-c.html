                            <p>This course is a deep dive into the world of <strong>PlayStation</strong> programming! We&#39;ll explore the PS1 hardware, understand its sub-components, and learn how to code games using <strong>MIPS assembler</strong> &amp; the <strong>C programming language</strong>. We&#39;ll also learn how to use the official Sony <strong>Psy-Q</strong> libraries on a modern development toolchain to be more productive and push faster 3D polygons out of our console.</p>

                            <p>We are about to enter the 5th generation of 32-bit consoles. This era brings with it many technology milestones, such as the adoption of CPUs based on <strong>RISC architecture</strong> and a preference for coding using a <strong>high-level language</strong> instead of writing games using plain assembly. We will start by learning the basics of MIPS assembly and evolve to use a C compiler with the official Psy-Q library to develop our final project.</p>

                            <p>The original development toolchain was designed for Windows/PC, so you can either use the original 32-bit library on a 32-bit operating system (<strong>Windowx XP</strong>), or you can use a modern C compiler with Visual Studio Code on a 64-bit operating system (<strong>Windows 11</strong>). Emulating a Windows system on <strong>macOS</strong> or <strong>Linux</strong> is also possible!</p>

                        <div>
                            <p>Learning how to create games for the original PlayStation is a great excuse to explore really hardcore <strong>computer science</strong> topics. As we learn different aspects of the 32-bit generation of consoles, we&#39;ll touch important concepts like algorithms, data structures, data compression, machine architecture, fixed-point math, computer graphics, and much (much!) more.</p>
                        </div>

                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>Many new games try to imitate the style and the visuals of old PS1 era using a modern game engine. This is <strong>no imitation</strong>! We&#39;ll be flipping bits on the <strong>OG</strong> PlayStation.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>Many people are surprised that the first part of the course uses <strong>MIPS assembly</strong>. Using an assembler in the early stages of our course allows us to really understand the low-level aspects of the console &amp; really grok how data flow inside the machine.</p>
                        </div>

                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>We&#39;ll then move away from assembly and climb one layer of abstraction up. We&#39;ll work with a <strong>C compiler</strong> paired with the official Sony Psy-Q library. This is where we&#39;ll really glue all the concepts that we learned before to consolidate our knowledge with a final big project.</p>

                            <p>At the end of the course, you&#39;ll have all the tools and the skills you need to grow and evolve on your own. You&#39;ll have a working project running on the PlayStation console and a deep understanding of the theory that underpins the development of PS1 games.</p>
