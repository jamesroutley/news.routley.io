    <p>Literally. A few minutes after the Big Bang, the universe was cool enough for the first elements to spontaneously form, deuterium and helium. That was all that existed for hundreds of millions of years, until the first stars formed, creating</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JdWlSF195Y">a gigantic nuclear furnace / where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees</a></p>

<p>The thing is, even millions of degrees at the pressure of a stellar core is insufficient to fuse that helium into anything heavier. Those reactions need to happen in red giant or larger stars, which probably required the first stars to first <em>die out after burning for billions of years</em>, and gradually created carbon, oxygen, silicon, and so on. Just imagine how weird planetary systems must have been during those first few billion years: every planet a gas giant or small ball of gas.</p>

<p>But that isn’t even the most amazing part. Even in the center of the largest supergiant stars, there isn’t enough temperature and pressure to fuse any element heavier than iron. With an atomic number of 26, that includes all of the cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc in the universe. <em>Those</em> are all created by the fractions of a second where supernovas collapse in on themselves. They are then blasted around the universe with the force of a, uh, supernova.</p>

<p><em>You</em>, of course, would not be able to function without all of the zinc (32 ppm), copper (1 ppm), selenium (0.19 ppm), and iodine (0.16 ppm) inside of you. You probably could not have existed just if the universe were only 5 billion years old. In a very real way, you are made of exploded stars.</p>
