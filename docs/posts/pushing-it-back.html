            <p>(On vacation this month, hence lack of blogging ...)</p>

<p>Apparently archaeologists have discovered <a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2023/09/20/archaeologists-discover-worlds-oldest-wooden-structure/">the eearliest known wooden structure</a> in Kalambo Falls, Zambia: two cut logs bearing tool marks that were shaped and joined to form part of a structure—476,000 years ago. Click through the link above for details as to how they dated it, and why it appears to have survived: it&#39;s being reported in <em>Nature</em> so this looks pretty solid, and it&#39;s a jaw-dropper. Wood tends to rot, and most wooden structures more than a few centuries old are known to archaeology from the holes they leave in the soil rather than from actual structural remains (much like the lack of paleontological evidence of organisms that don&#39;t have a bony skeleton, such as octopi or jellyfish: there are rare imprints but soft tissue seldom fossilizes).</p>

        </div>


        <div id="more">
            <p>This isn&#39;t the only evidence of pre-<em>Sapiens</em> hominids building wooden structures: there&#39;s some suggestion that <em>H. Heidelbergensis</em> may have built small villages in France about 400ky ago: small huts surrounding a long, thin building approximately 15 metres long by 3 metres wide. (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=LXmY3Q8qBngC&amp;pg=PT74&amp;lpg=PT74&amp;dq=homo+heidelbergensis+france+structure+15+meters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OjlUErbR0u&amp;sig=ACfU3U3f24Ipw1Clulwo9bCUefxCtLwblA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwia1Mn6iJX3AhXhg-AKHU3IDek4ChDoAXoECB8QAw#v=onepage&amp;q=homo%20heidelbergensis%20france%20structure%2015%20meters&amp;f=false">Cited here</a> but I can&#39;t follow the link because it&#39;s been hit by Hacker News; it met with considerable disbelief, but the report from Zambia makes it seem more plausible.)</p>

<p>If we posit that wooden structures go back to pre-<em>Sapiens</em> times, then what else could be out there but not obvious to us from this remove? One logical possibility would be written records of some sort, using a substrate that hasn&#39;t survived—prone to waterlogging or insects, modern paper would certainly not survive across tens of kiloyears. Our earliest modern &#34;written&#34; records mostly date to settled cities in relatively arid regions, from Mesopotamia to Egypt, aside from worked stone inscriptions, baked clay tablets (which imply a perceived requirement for permanence), and cave paintings. Textiles are notoriously fragile on a time scale of centuries, for that matter. There&#39;s some evidence of worked beads and jewellery going back up to 70ky; there&#39;s no reason to suspect that fabric may not be similarly old, or even older—it&#39;s simply labour-intensive to manufacture (so scarce to begin with) and doesn&#39;t last much longer than a human lifetime.</p>

<p>Looking around, I see that very few of our artefacts are designed with permanence in mind beyond the scale of a human lifetime. We are reasonably confident that pre-neolithic societies mostly didn&#39;t form permanent agricultural settlements, so their population density remained low and the human tendency to amass possessions would be limited by their ability to carry them without  beasts of burden—further reducing the number of artefacts that could be discovered today. <em>But none of this precludes the possibility of complex societies with buildings, literature, and culture in pre-</em>Sapiens <em>time</em>.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s the opening for fiction about complex societies pretty much any time after genus <em>Homo</em> emerged, two million years ago.</p>

<p>Now for the real question: how far back into deep time do you have to go to posit a non-hominid civilization for which little or no evidence has survived to the present day? </p>

<p>As I already noted, most of our structures are impermanent. Smartphones are designed with a lifespan of 2-6 years in mind: cars for 5-15 years: houses for 30-100 years. Pre-stressed/reinforced concrete only last for decades, as witness the current schools/hospitals scandal in the UK. Most of our civil engineering (bridges, roads, railways, sewers) wears out within a century or so and would be hard to detect after a few millennia. Only a few of our structures (mines, reclaimed low-lying land, dams) are likely to leave an imprint lasting longer: perhaps our most durable relics will be the depleted oil and gas deposits and the cores of abandoned nuclear reactors (which are deposits of unusual isotopes encased in ridiculously durable steel capsules, that could plausibly survive anything short of tectonic subduction as a detectable imprint).</p>

<p>Intelligent dinosaurs: would we be able to detect the imprints of their cities and research hubs? Or, push it forward a few tens of millions of years: what about the giant flightless birds of South America? What if the whales in the sea today are the evolved descendants of a genus that at one time, 40My ago, spawned boat-building tool users and a thalassic civilization that is mostly submerged? How hard would it be to detect an 18th century peak age-of-sail civilization (gunpowder, cast iron cannon, printing presses) at that remove in time?</p>
