    <h1>Recurse Center, day 1</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I left my job two weeks ago. Since then, I’ve been spending less time on the
computer, more time with the cats.</p>
<p>But not <em>no</em> time on the computer. Stephen and I put together
<a href="https://github.com/cceckman/fractal-farlands/">Fractal Overdrive</a>, rendering
fractals incorrectly for aesthetic effect, as a
<a href="https://sigbovik.org/2024/">SIGBOVIK</a> submission; and I made it through the
easy half of addressing a bug in <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sccache/issues/2132">sccache</a>.</p>
<p>And now: today was my first day at <a href="https://recurse.com">the Recurse Center</a>.</p>
<h2 id="known-unknowns">Known unknowns</h2>
<p>I’ve got some things I know I want to work on.</p>
<h3 id="you-are-here">You are here</h3>
<p>I want to write more. (Yes, that makes this the “sorry this blog has been
so quiet” post.)</p>
<p>Along with that, I want to tweak how I build / host / serve this site.
But working on <em>tools and infrastructure</em> is too much fun, so I have to give
myself a budget: no more time working on <em>serving</em> than on <em>writing</em>.
I only get quota once the post goes public– drafts don’t count!</p>
<h3 id="lock-termination-checker">Lock termination checker</h3>
<p>In my last job, we dealt with preemption-disabled code regions
and locks. We relied on code review to check
that the program would eventually reenable preemtion / release the lock –
a human check.</p>
<p>I’d like to make something that can verify this property <em>in situ</em>–
something lighter than “formally specify the whole thing”, more like
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html">LLVM’s thread safety analyzer</a>.</p>
<p>The comment I’ve received more than once about this: “Isn’t that the halting
problem?” Which, almost, it’s related. But think about how the same
conversation goes with human reasoning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> Hey, can you take a look at this code? Will this function terminate?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> <em>thinks</em></p>
<p><strong>Alice:</strong> …you’ve been quiet for five minutes. Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Well… there is a loop here, and I can’t figure out whether
the condition that bounds it will necessarily become true.
So I don’t know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our checker has the option to say “I don’t know”: “I don’t have enough information”,
or “I don’t have enough time”, or “I don’t have an algorithm to solve this”.
The feedback here is for humans, who can decide whether “I don’t know” is a
problem with the checker or the subject.</p>
<p>I think my first step in this will be going through
<a href="https://github.com/banach-space/llvm-tutor">llvm-tutor</a>;
and maybe stepping slightly out of that, to render the control-flow graph
in <a href="https://graphviz.org/">dot</a>.
(Or maybe <a href="https://text-to-diagram.com/">something else</a>, per a tip from
<a href="https://lippingoff.netlify.app/">my batchmate Zach</a>.)</p>
<p>Then the easy version, “always say I don’t know”; the slightly more complex
version, “If the basic blocks form a DAG, say ’terminates’”; and then…</p>
<h3 id="verification-symbolic-execution-type-systems">Verification? Symbolic execution? Type systems?</h3>
<p>In “watching for that stuff in the background”, I’ve seen some more things
I want to learn about.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Formal methods and verification. It sounds like several of
my batchmates have experimence and/or interest in this; I’m looking forward
to learning from and with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Symbolic execution. I read the <a href="https://klee-se.org/">KLEE</a> paper a while
back, but haven’t used it. What can it do?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type systems. Random stuff I’ve read indicates what I might be trying to do
is create (apply? identify?) a
<a href="https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/extending-rusts-effect-system/">nondivergence effect</a>,
also discussed <a href="https://www.fstar-lang.org/tutorial/book/part4/part4_div.html">here</a>.
Maybe I should play around with an effect-oriented language and see what
I learn from it?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="statup-showdown">Statup showdown</h3>
<p>I’ve started some experiments, trying to determine which languages take
the longest to get to “my code”. I have that chart - then the question is,
<em>why</em> do they have these different properties?</p>
<p>The other side of this question: what tools can I use to
debug performance, especially where the kernel is involved? What knobs do
I have to change the performance, especially when most of the system
(language runtime) is outside of my control?</p>
<h2 id="unknown-unknowns">Unknown unknowns</h2>
<p>One of the points that’s been reinforced during the RC orientation is being open
to opportunities. There’s a lot of interesting projects / areas that folks
are or are starting to work on… and I know I’ve got a lot to learn about
a lot of things.</p>
<p>So…maybe I’ll port Fractal Overdrive to WGPU? Or start something in the Godot
engine? Or… just see what else folks need a partner on.</p>
