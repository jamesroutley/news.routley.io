<p>Eleven years after its debut as a <em>Half-Life</em> mod, <em>The Stanley Parable</em> remains one of the most interesting and divisive video games of the early &#39;10s. However players may have felt about that mod or its 2013 standalone Steam launch, it was at least a very unique comedy game.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/the-stanley-parable-review-you-are-in-a-room-there-are-two-doors/">My 2013 review</a> of the Steam version was mostly glowing. It came from a younger Sam Machkovech, a writer still surprised and delighted by concepts in video games like second-person narrative and ludonarrative dissonance.</p>

<p><em>The Stanley Parable</em>, like many other games of its era, explored the illusion of &#34;choice&#34; in video games. Yet <em>TSP</em> stood out. While the &#34;would you kindly&#34; twist in that era&#39;s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/08/bioshock-objectivism-philosophy-analysis/"><em>BioShock</em></a> was meant to heighten the drama, <em>TSP</em> landed in a dark comedy realm. Its script and progression held some similarities to games like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/07/spec-ops-the-lines-lead-writer-on-creating-an-un-heroic-war-story/"><em>Spec Ops: The Line</em></a>, but unlike its peers, <em>TSP</em>&#39;s tendency to surprise players persisted even after they were clued in to the central joke: that their choices were meaningless. Its humor was as much about novelty as it was about exaggerating other games&#39; spins on the concept.</p>
<p>At this point, that comedic well has run dry, right? What else can <em>The Stanley Parable</em> possibly deliver to gamers in 2022, whether they&#39;ve already played the original to completion or missed the game in its first go-round?</p>
<h2>Forgive me for a brief third-person aside</h2>

<p>Sam Machkovech stared at the headline he&#39;d written, one meant to answer this very question. &#34;Review: <em>Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</em> is a mandatory game for comedy fans,&#34; he read to himself. He read both colons aloud as the word &#34;colon&#34; and sighed. &#34;Two colons in a headline,&#34; he said. &#34;We try not to do that at Ars Technica.&#34;</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Sam began to type more words, using the third-person narrative conceit that made the original <em>Stanley Parable</em> game so memorable. &#34;Are people still amused by this?&#34; he asked himself, visibly annoyed that his internal dialogue had bled into the review. Perhaps this isn&#39;t helpful to anyone trying to decide whether to spend $24.99 on a new game launching today on Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch—especially those who didn&#39;t play the original games or read the original review and thus didn&#39;t realize that he was lifting the whole &#34;narrator talks about you to you&#34; schtick of the game.</p>

<p>Or maybe it <em>is</em> useful! Maybe by reading Sam&#39;s interpretation of the concept, Ars Technica&#39;s audience could get a spoiler-free taste of this follow-up game, which includes both old and new content. Sam Machkovech has seen his fair share of complaints about having surprises ruined before someone plays a game or sees a film. &#34;No spoilers,&#34; Sam said aloud to himself in a high-pitched register, perhaps sarcastically.</p>
<p>Sam moved forward with the gimmick, which he believed would charm anyone who enjoyed the original yet would function as a warning for anyone uneasy about dark-comedy visual novels.</p>
<p>Then he read the above paragraph and shook his head. &#34;No, choosing to disobey the narrator is one of the most fun things to do in both the original <em>Stanley Parable</em> and this new follow-up. I should follow suit.&#34;</p>
