<!--

Internal Note (by Pablo): There is 280+ merged MRs in the last two months. This
is just absolutely nuts :D
-->

<p>Fasten your seatbelts, after skipping the monthly progress report in June
because of the
<a href="https://postmarketos.org/blog/2024/06/16/v24.06-release/">v24.06 release</a>, we have at least twice as
much news to share!</p>
<h2 id="homepage"><a href="#homepage">Homepage</a></h2>
<p>First, we obviously updated the homepage. The new design is a collaboration
between <a href="https://gitlab.com/dikasetyaprayogi">Dika</a>,
<a href="https://bewares.it/">Markus</a> and
<a href="https://postmarketos.org/core-contributors/#oliver-smith-ollieparanoid">Oliver</a>. It&#39;s more than just a
design change actually. If you take a close look at the links in the top
navigation bar you may first notice that it isn&#39;t as overloaded with random
links anymore as it used to be. And secondly that there is a new
<em>explore</em> button that more or less lists the <a href="https://postmarketos.org/explore/">links we had there
previously (but now nicely sorted in categories!)</a> as well as a new
<em>team</em> button.</p>
<p><a href="https://postmarketos.org/trusted-contributors/#bryant-mairs-hehim-susurrus">Bryant</a> spent a whole lot
of time and effort on that. The team page shows
<a href="https://postmarketos.org/team">who makes postmarketOS</a>. Who the Core Contributors (renamed from Core
Team for consistency) and Trusted Contributors are and what we are doing in
postmarketOS. What we think about, enjoy doing and where you can find us on
Matrix etc. The teams page also has the purpose to list the contributor groups
and teams we now have, which have grown quite a lot in the last months, in one
easy to read overview. So Bryant figured before we add yet another new button
to the navigation bar, we should first unclutter the navigation bar andâ€¦ while
at it we just did this whole redesign!</p>
<h2 id="organizational"><a href="#organizational">Organizational</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We decided on
  <a href="https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Rules_for_merging">new approval requirements for merging patches</a>.
  This addresses problems with good patches not getting merged, that oftentimes
  were caused by lack of clear understanding of who is supposed to approve and
  merge patches. With further work we plan to automatically assign maintainers
  to new merge requests (like it works in Alpine&#39;s aports). We apologize to
  everybody that had a hard time with the previous review process, and we hope
  this makes the workflow better for everyone. Feel free to reply to
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/postmarketos/-/issues/66">#66</a> if you still experience problems with the new
  workflow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wrote a <a href="https://postmarketos.org/blog/2024/07/17/news-on-grant-applications/">separate blog post</a>
  about postmarketOS being selected for NGI Zero Core funding, as well as how
  the European Commission made a draft in which NGI will not be funded anymore
  in 2025.</p>

<h2 id="pmbootstrap-300_alpha"><a href="#pmbootstrap-300_alpha">pmbootstrap 3.0.0_alpha</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The pmbootstrap
  <a href="https://postmarketos.org/blog/2024/05/19/pmOS-update-2024-05/#pmbootstrap-230-and-feature-freeze">feature freeze</a>
  is over, <a href="https://postmarketos.org/core-contributors/#caleb-connolly-calebccff">Caleb&#39;s</a> big
  pmbootstrap v3 patch series has been merged! This brought massive refactorings
  and improvements, making pmbootstrap easier to maintain and bringing more
  performance and better usability. Read their
  <a href="https://connolly.tech/posts/2024_06_15-pmbootstrap-v3/">blog post</a> for
  details. Thanks to Caleb and everybody who tested pmb v3 already and
  reported/fixed regressions!</li>
<li>Several improvements in code formatting and linting. Thanks,
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/WhyNotHugo">WhyNotHugo</a>,

  Caleb, Oliver!</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/-/merge_requests/2333">kconfigcheck support</a>
  was moved from inline Python to a toml file. This allowed to move the
  kconfig check file to
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/merge_requests/5301">pmaports</a>.
  This makes it much easier to enforce kernel config changes, as we can now
  change the kernel configs at the same time as changing the kernel config
  checks, as well as having different kernel config checks depending on the
  pmaports branch. Thanks Oliver and everybody that took part on the discussion
  that led to this change!</li>
<li>pmbootstrap documentation is now
  <a href="https://docs.postmarketos.org/pmbootstrap/">online</a>! Thanks
  <a href="https://postmarketos.org/trusted-contributors/#robert-eckelmann-longnoserob">Rob</a>
  for getting

  the mirrors configuration was reworked and documented
  (<a href="https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/-/merge_requests/2361">!2361</a>). Thanks, Oliver and Caleb!</li>

  Thanks Rob,

  Luca, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/flamingradian">Richard</a>! It is very cool to see
  how the initial work by Richard and

  resulting in more Qualcomm devices getting sensor support. Truly a team work!</p>

<p>Major initramfs changes to
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/merge_requests/5000">improve logging and the debug console</a>
  as well as using
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/postmarketOS/pmaports/-/merge_requests/5048">udev and refining root/boot partition detection and waiting</a>.
  This has some really nice features, such as holding volume up during boot
  to trigger a log dump. Beware that the size of the initramfs has increased,
  devices that are affected can use <code>postmarketos-initramfs-minimal</code> instead
  (<a href="https://postmarketos.org/edge/2024/06/18/big-chungus-initramfs/">edge blog post</a>). Thanks Caleb
  and Clayton!</p>
