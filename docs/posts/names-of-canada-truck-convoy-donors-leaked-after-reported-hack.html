The spokesperson did not immediately comment on the hack itself.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">The site, however, appeared to be offline. Website visitors were met with a message that it was under maintenance and &#34;we will be back very soon.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">GiveSendGo had previously asserted it was not subject to a Canadian court order that froze these funds.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">A journalist at the Daily Dot digital news outlet said on Twitter that the GiveSendGo site suffered a hack overnight and had its front page briefly replaced by a clip from the movie &#34;Frozen&#34; and a manifesto accusing it of supporting &#34;an insurrection in Ottawa.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Reuters could neither immediately confirm the hack nor the leak claims, although Distributed Denial of Secrets has a long record of hosting leaked data from right-wing organizations, including the far-right Patriot Front and the Oath Keepers.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">DDoS said that because the donor information contained sensitive personal information, it would not be making the data available publicly but would instead be offering it to &#34;journalists and researchers.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">DDoS describes itself as a non-profit devoted to enabling the free transmission of data in the public interest.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">GiveSendGo became a prime conduit for money to the protesters after mainstream crowdfunding platform GoFundMe blocked donations to the self-declared Freedom Convoy.
