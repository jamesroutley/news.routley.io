After 10 years, I got tired of it and moved to Taiwan. I just wanted to go to Asia somewhere.</p><blockquote>When I got to Asia, I figured a unique experience would be to sell everything and start fresh in life with a blog.</blockquote><p><strong>Asianometry started off as a travel blog/channel</strong> <em>(though you can’t see the videos anymore)</em>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyAGySOz60">first videos</a> were on travel, hiking and landmarks, not geopolitics.</p><p>After 4-5 videos, no-one cared and I got like 10-15 views. I realized that <strong>if I wanted to last, I needed to make this enjoyable</strong>. So, I decided to make videos on topics I was interested in.</p><p>At the time <strong>I was a history buff</strong> so I wanted to do videos on World War II and the Chinese Civil War. And that’s how the channel “started” - making very obscure history videos <em>(on Genghis Khan and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-EzSENcXtk">Qing Dynasty</a>)</em> that no-one really cared about but I was interested in.</p><figure><img src="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/image-25.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1294" height="422" srcset="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-25.png 600w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image-25.png 1000w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/image-25.png 1294w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Asianometry&#39;s earliest (published &amp; listed) videos</figcaption></figure><h3 id="how-did-you-get-started">How did you get started?</h3><p><strong>I was very low budget <em>(and still am)</em></strong> as I like to keep overheads low.</p><ul><li>MacBook Air</li><li>Blue Snowball <em>(that my ex-vlogger sister gave me)</em></li><li>iMovie <em>(or even iMovie on my iPhone)</em></li></ul><p>I’d post once every 2 weeks when working in cafes. </p><blockquote>When I just got started, I didn&#39;t realize just how rough making China/Taiwan-related videos would be</blockquote><p>There was either frequent abuse, low-quality spam in the comments or little to no engagement at all.</p><figure><img src="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/image-24.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="872" height="690" srcset="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-24.png 600w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/image-24.png 872w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Examples of comments on Asianometry&#39;s earliest videos</figcaption></figure><blockquote>Asianometry is a product of my <strong>passion for learning and sharing what I learn in an engaging manner</strong>. That’s what kept me going despite the abuse, spam and low engagement.</blockquote><h3 id="how-did-you-get-to-10-100-1000-subscribers-and-ultimately-where-you-are-currently">How did you get to 10, 100, 1000 subscribers and ultimately where you are currently?</h3><p><strong>My first 10 subscribers</strong> came from friends and family. I just posted about my channel on my personal Facebook account to let friends/family know I&#39;m doing &#34;this vlogging thing&#34;. They all subscribed to stay updated on my journey.</p><blockquote>After a year of experimenting with travel and obscure history videos, I had 300 subscribers.</blockquote><p><strong>My first breakthrough</strong> came when I created 4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD_EBrnSNa8">videos on China (and Taiwan)</a> which were picked up by the YouTube algorithm (possibly due to great watch time?). Then, <strong>someone posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aLxf_ZAhJ0">my China-Taiwan video</a> to a right-wing forum</strong> and I went from 300-1500 subscribers extremely quickly.</p><blockquote>Two years after reaching 1K subscribers, I was only at 4K subscribers. <strong>It took a really long time to get to 10K subscribers</strong>. I sensed I needed to change my strategy for coming up with ideas and presenting them</blockquote><p>I realized my passion for history wouldn’t translate into channel growth (or monetization). I needed to pivot away from obscure history videos.</p><p>I decided I wanted to make this YouTube thing work. So, in September 2020, I decided to take a sabbatical from work and focused on producing as many different kinds of videos as possible.</p><p>I started with tech; I made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCnF-i1XDiU">videos relevant to Taiwan&#39;s semiconductor chip shortage</a> that was happening at the time.</p><p>These were a hit. <strong>Producing as many different videos as possible and discovering this niche was what got me to 10K subscribers.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/Screenshot-2022-07-27-145805.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1034" height="695" srcset="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Screenshot-2022-07-27-145805.png 600w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/Screenshot-2022-07-27-145805.png 1000w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/Screenshot-2022-07-27-145805.png 1034w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Semiconductor related videos always performed well</figcaption></figure><p><strong>To get to 100K subscribers</strong>, I tried to focus on the tech/semiconductor niche as much as possible <em>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP7PMmetpyw">since those videos were doing very well</a>)</em>. </p><p>My growth pattern was simple; I just produced more and more videos in an under-served niche, got picked up by the YouTube algorithm and had some of them <a href="https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/what-happened-to-singapores-tsmc.6445628/">organically reposted/viral on forums</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/image-27.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1159" height="842" srcset="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-27.png 600w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image-27.png 1000w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/image-27.png 1159w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>One of Asianometry&#39;s videos being reposted on a Singapore forum (not by Asianometry)</figcaption></figure><p>This strategy hasn&#39;t changed much. But to get to my current subscriber count (~270K subs), I focused on watch time and retaining viewers for as long as possible. </p><blockquote><strong>I realized it&#39;s important to make content I watched myself.</strong> I wouldn&#39;t watch stuff that&#39;s just a guy boringly saying a collection of events. I wanted to know the underlying stories &amp; ideas behind something.</blockquote><p>So I changed my videos from being less <em>&#34;Wikipedia-styled vomit&#34;</em> to being more about story-telling, explaining ideas and problem solving.</p><figure><img src="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/Untitled.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1036" height="788" srcset="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Untitled.png 600w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/Untitled.png 1000w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/Untitled.png 1036w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Older videos (top) vs more recent videos (bottom)</figcaption></figure><p>After this change, watch time doubled and tripled <em>(it was crazy!)</em>. From then on, if a particular topic didn&#39;t have at least 50% watch time, I dumped it. Keeping your viewers on your videos is key to growth.</p><blockquote>As MrBeast says, &#34;<em><strong>If you make content that people genuinely crave, can’t find anywhere else, and actually watch. You’ll blow up.&#34;</strong></em></blockquote><figure><img src="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/image-26.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="499" height="228"/></figure><h3 id="how-much-money-are-you-making-and-howie-explain-the-distribution">How much money are you making (and how - i.e. explain the distribution)?</h3><p>The channel currently averages $3-5K/month from:</p><ul><li><strong>AdSense </strong>(~60%) - $1-3K/month (fluctuates depending on video RPM)</li><li><strong>Patreon </strong>(~40%) - ~$2K/month (quite stable)</li></ul><p><strong>Advertisement income </strong>fluctuates a lot as it&#39;s very hit-driven and geography-driven. Most of my viewer-base is in Asia which has much lower RPMs than other locations. So revenue from AdSense depends on whether a video has gone viral (and racked up more watch-time) or what country the viewers are from.</p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/Asianometry"><strong>Patreon</strong></a> is an extremely stable source of income. I give my Patreons special Discord benefits and early access to videos (often months in advance).</p><figure><img src="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/image-23.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="635" height="702" srcset="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-23.png 600w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/image-23.png 635w"/><figcaption>Asianometry&#39;s Patreon (as at time of posting)</figcaption></figure><p><strong>I do get lots of sponsorship requests but I turn them all down</strong>. Sponsorships are a lot of work and I don&#39;t have the bandwidth/infrastructure to handle it. I have no assistants and still have a day job so I can&#39;t be bothered dealing with invoices, accountants etc. It&#39;s just not fun even though I can unlock a ton of value. Maybe when I have more time, I&#39;ll go for it.</p><p><strong>I also tried releasing merchandise</strong> <strong>but no-one bought it</strong> (despite promoting it on my newsletter). </p><blockquote>This has always been a hobby of mine and <strong>I feel like I’ve been dragged kicking and screaming into monetization</strong>. It isn’t about the money, it’s always been about the enjoyment for me.</blockquote><h3 id="what-does-your-content-creation-process-look-like">What does your content creation process look like?</h3><p><strong>To find ideas</strong>, I start with my interests. If I’m genuinely curious and want to learn, it’s a potential video. Viewers also provide feedback/ideas via email &amp; comments. If the proposed idea’s interesting, I’ll work on it.</p><p>The majority of the time taken to produce a video goes to <strong>research and script-writing</strong>. Research and script-writing (and re-writing) can take from 4 days to 4 weeks. I basically dive into blogs, books, literature, videos etc. until I know the topic backwards.</p><p>Afterwards, it&#39;s all about about <strong>preparing assets</strong> (creating maps, collecting pictures and videos) and <strong>recording</strong>. I&#39;ve found <a href="https://www.storyblocks.com/">Storyblocks</a> makes this way easier but it still takes time.</p><p><strong>Editing </strong>takes up ~30-40% of the time after which I release the video for early access <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Asianometry">Patreons</a> (up to 2 months before release) and then on YouTube.</p><p><strong>I don&#39;t do much to promote videos</strong>. I really just rely on the YouTube algorithm and make the full script available on the <a href="https://asianometry.substack.com/">newsletter</a>. <em>I&#39;ve never reposted a video on forums even though my videos get picked up in a bunch of forums all the time.</em></p><h3 id="if-you-could-go-back-to-square-one-again-what-would-you-do-differently">If you could go back to square one again, what would you do differently?</h3><p><strong>📹 Keep posting videos and never stop</strong>. You can’t lose if you keep posting and working on things you’re interested in. <em>I posted 2 videos a week for the last 2 years - it’s probably the number one reason for my success</em></p><p><strong>😍 Learn why people enjoy your videos and lean into that</strong>. For me it was the quality of my research. But for you, it could be your personality, engagement etc.</p><p><strong>🏄‍♂️ Try new ideas and things you feel you’re not qualified to do</strong>. Your worst case scenario is that no-one watches it. Your best case scenario is discovering a new passion and unlocking growth for your channel.</p><figure><img src="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/image-22.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1293" height="640" srcset="https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/image-22.png 600w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/image-22.png 1000w, https://www.screenlace.com/content/images/2022/07/image-22.png 1293w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Some of Asianometry&#39;s oldest videos were on a variety of different topics</figcaption></figure><p><strong>👀 Focus on watch time.</strong> If viewers aren&#39;t watching &gt;50% of the video, you won’t grow/succeed.

Asianometry wouldn&#39;t be what it is today if I didn’t start like I did.
