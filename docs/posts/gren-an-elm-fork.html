    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><article><h3>A programming language for simple and correct applications</h3><p>Gren is a functional programming language with carefully managed side-effects and a strong static type system. The language consists of a few concepts with human readable names that compose well together, so you can do more with less.</p><p>Programs written in Gren are simple, have few or no runtime exceptions and are fun to work with.</p></article><article><h3>Compiler as an assistant</h3><p>Since side effects and error handling is represented in Gren&#39;s type system, the compiler can catch a lot of errors which are usually only discovered when the program is running in other languages.</p><p>In Gren, a lot of time has been invested in how error messages are presented to you, so that the compiler feels more like a helpful assistant.</p></article><article><h3>Efficiency</h3><p>Gren produces small JavaScript files, and runs surprisingly fast. Applications written in Gren can be both smaller and faster than your average React-based application.</p></article></section></div>
