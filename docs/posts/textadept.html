					<h2>Features</h2>
					<hr/>
					<p>
						Textadept is a fast, minimalist, and remarkably extensible cross-platform text editor.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h3>Fast and Minimalist</h3>
					<p>
						Textadept’s user interface is sleek and simple. Relentlessly optimized for
						speed and minimalism over the years, the editor consists of less than 2000 lines
						of C and C++ code, and less than 4000 lines of <a href="https://lua.org">Lua</a> code.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://orbitalquark.github.io/textadept/images/textadept.png" alt="Textadept"/></p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Cross Platform</h3>
					<p>
						Textadept runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. It also has a terminal version, which
						is ideal for work on remote machines.
					</p>

				</div>
				
				<div>
					<h3>Remarkably Extensible</h3>
					<p>
						Textadept is an ideal editor for programmers who want endless extensibility
						without sacrificing speed or succumbing to code bloat and featuritis. The editor
						gives you complete control over the entire application using the Lua programming
						language. Everything from moving the caret to changing menus and key bindings
						on-the-fly to handling core events is possible. Its potential is vast.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Multiple Language Support</h3>
					<p>
						Being a programmer’s editor, Textadept excels at editing source code. It
						understands the syntax and structure of more than 100 different programming languages
						and recognizes hundreds of file types. Textadept uses this knowledge to make viewing
						and editing code faster and easier. It can also compile and run simple source files.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<h3>Unlimited Split Views</h3>
					<p>
						Both the graphical version and the terminal version of Textadept support unlimited
						vertical and horizontal view splitting, even of the same file.
					</p>
					<p><img src="https://orbitalquark.github.io/textadept/images/splitviews.png" alt="Split Views"/></p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Customizable Themes</h3>
					<p>
						Textadept uses themes to customize its look and feel. It comes with built-in light,
						dark, and terminal themes.
					</p>

					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<h3>Code Autocompletion</h3>
					<p>
						Not only can Textadept autocomplete words in files, but it can also autocomplete
						symbols for programming languages and display API documentation.
					</p>

					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Keyboard Driven</h3>
					<p>
						Textadept can be entirely keyboard driven. The editor defines key bindings for many
						common actions. You can easily reassign existing bindings or create new ones. Keys
						may be chained together or grouped into language-specific keys or key modes.
					</p>
					<h3>Self Contained</h3>
					<p>
						Textadept’s binary packages are self-contained and need not be installed. No
						administrator privileges are required either.
					</p>

				<div>
					<h3>Comprehensive Manual</h3>
					<p>
						Textadept comes with a comprehensive <a href="https://orbitalquark.github.io/textadept/manual.html">user manual</a> in the
						application’s <em>docs/</em> directory. It covers all of Textadept’s
						main features, including installation, usage, configuration, theming, scripting,
						and compilation.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<h3>Exhaustive API Documentation</h3>
					<p>
						Since Textadept is entirely scriptable with Lua, its API is heavily <a href="https://orbitalquark.github.io/textadept/api.html">documented</a>. This documentation is also located in <em>docs/</em>
						and is the ultimate resource on scripting Textadept. (The editor’s Lua
						internals also provide abundant scripting examples.)
					</p>

					<h3>Try It Yourself</h3>
					<p>
						Learn even more about Textadept by downloading and trying
						it out yourself. If you’re not completely satisfied, <a href="https://github.com/orbitalquark/textadept/discussions">contact us</a> or e-mail
						me personally (orbitalquark att triplequasar.com). You may also fork the project,
						submit patches, or <a href="https://orbitalquark.github.io/textadept/thanks.html#sponsors">sponsor a feature</a>. Textadept
						is 100% open source.

				<ul>
					<li>
						Textadept has a <a href="https://orbitalquark.github.io/textadept/changelog.html">proven track record</a>, with at least
						one release every 2 months for 12+ years and no signs of inactivity. Also, as an
						open-source project, the editor remain freely available.
					</li>
					<li>
						Textadept is a real cross-platform desktop application, backed by a world-class editing
						engine that <a href="https://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaRelated.html">dozens</a>
						of editors and IDEs have depended on for <a href="https://www.scintilla.org/ScintillaHistory.html">over 20 years</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Textadept is scriptable in a language that was <em><a href="https://www.lua.org/history.html">carefully designed</a></em> to run on
						any platform at high speed and with a minimal memory footprint. Lua is used <a href="https://www.lua.org/uses.html">everywhere</a> from video games to embedded
						devices. It is easy to <a href="https://www.lua.org/start.html">learn</a> too!
					</li>
					<li>
						Textadept is resource efficient, consuming tens of MB of RAM at startup and hardly
						any CPU while under load. Even with over 30 of its own source files open at once,
						Textadept does not add more than 30MB of RAM to its overall usage and has no input
						lag at all.
					</li>
					<li>
						Textadept does not rely on external packages to provide its functionality and does
						not depend on a package ecosystem to thrive. The editor gives you plenty of the
						tools you need out of the box.
					</li>
					<li>
						Textadept has sensible defaults and does not expect you to spend hours customizing
						it before you can start being productive.
					</li>
					<li>
						With about 30 main source files comprising roughly 6000 lines of heavily documented
						code, Textadept’s internals are remarkably easy to read, understand, keep
						track of, and extend to your liking.
					</li>
					<li>
						Did you see that there is a terminal version in case you need to do work on a
						remote server?
					</li>
					<li>
						Textadept does not track you. It does not attempt to connect to the internet. <em>It
						is just a text editor</em>.
					</li>
