										<p>The top 10% owns 87% of the stocks in this country.</p>
<p>They also own 84% of the private businesses, 44% of real estate and two-thirds of overall wealth.</p>

<p>These numbers have all increased since 1989 as well — total wealth (60.8% to 67.3%), stocks (81.7% to 87.2%), private businesses (78.4% to 84.4%) and real estate (38.2% to 43.9%).</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/consumers/us-economy-strength-rich-spending-2c34a571" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Wall Street Journal</a>, the top 10% also accounts for 50% of all consumer spending:</p>

<p>Three decades ago the top 10% made up 36% of spending.</p>
<p>It’s accelerating this decade:</p>
<p><em>Between September 2023 and September 2024, the high earners increased their spending by 12%. Spending by working-class and middle-class households, meanwhile, dropped over the same period. </em></p>
<p><em>The bottom 80% of earners spent 25% more than they did four years earlier, barely outpacing price increases of 21% over that period. The top 10% spent 58% more.</em></p>
<p>The top 10% is spending way more on an inflation-adjusted basis in the 2020s.</p>
<p>Look at the travel budget for the wealthiest household (via another piece from the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/disney-parks-price-hikes-consumers-0bf4dbd6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WSJ</a>):</p>

<p>The wealthy class exist in a different stratosphere and there are wide-ranging implications here:</p>
<p><strong>Concentration is everywhere. </strong>The stock market is concentrated. So is the economy. This concentration could make markets and the economy riskier but it also makes them harder to handicap.</p>
<p>When you have wealth concentrated in the hands of the few it’s much more difficult to understand what’s going on using metrics that may have worked in the past.</p>
<p>This is why economic anecdotes aren’t very useful when trying to gauge the performance of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if the wealth effect slows? </strong>The top 10% is spending more in part because their financial assets have increased in value substantially. Stocks are up. Housing prices are up. Equity in businesses is up.</p>
<p>The stock market is not the economy, but it seems like the two are now more intertwined than they were in the past.</p>
<p><strong>I’m not sure what stops this. </strong>Wealth inequality is only getting worse in this country and frankly I’m not sure what stops this train. It feels like it’s unsustainable but the rich just keep getting richer.</p>
<p>Short of a financial crisis I don’t really see what slows this trend. Even then I’m not sure there would be much of a long-term impact. If there is a financial crisis, guess who has the means to ride out a storm and buy assets on the cheap? The top 10%.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don’t see wealth inequality getting better any time soon.</p>
<p>I’m fairly confident it’s only going to get worse from here.</p>
