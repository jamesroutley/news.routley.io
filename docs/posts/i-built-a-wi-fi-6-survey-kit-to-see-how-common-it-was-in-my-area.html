    <h1>Show HN: I built a Wi-Fi 6 survey kit to see how common it was in my area</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p id="f6f1">As we recently passed the 1 year anniversary of the IEEE Standards Board’s final approval of <a href="https://www.ieee802.org/11/Reports/802.11_Timelines.htm" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">IEEE 802.11ax in February 2021</a> I’ve been thinking about the rate of adoption — how many devices and networks are out there communicating via Wi-Fi’s newest standard? Personally I was very drawn to 802.11ax’s mandatory use of Management Frame Protection (MFP) and the forward secrecy provided by Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE) and jumped at the chance to upgrade my home Access Point (AP) to take advantage of the standard’s new features. Has there been a big push by manufacturers to sell more secure and faster equipment to consumers? Have consumers, many of which have been spending <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/27/business/economy/covid-parenting-work-time.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">more time at home</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/PI_2021.09.01_COVID-19-and-Tech_FINAL.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">more time online</a>, been looking at new tech to support their new lifestyles? I set out to learn more and try to answer these questions.</p><figure><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/980/1*cMYxQEq2l5gc5_8cDzYc8w.png" width="490" height="538" role="presentation"/></p><figcaption>macOS detailed Wi-Fi network view of an IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) connection.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="9024">What can Wi-Fi Alliance data tell us?</h2><p id="f3e7">IEEE 802.11ax is likely more common recognized as Wi-Fi 6: the marketing term promoted by the Wi-Fi Alliance (WFA) to refer to 6th generation 802.11 technology.

Indeed, given the current number of certifications a quarter of the way into this year, it seems the decline could continue through 2022.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p><img alt="Graph plotting Wi-Fi 5 and Wi-Fi 6 product certifications from 2013 to 2022.

There might only be a 2,280+ Wi-Fi 6 products certified but maybe those products are exceptionally popular and are widely used. I don’t have data to say either way.</p><p id="8d0b">It seems that the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/chip-manufacturers-struggling-meet-demand-151700683.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">global chip shortage</a> could be a reason for the decline in new product certifications, if at least for Wi-Fi 6E. According to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/07/chip_supply_problems_may_affect_wi_fi_6/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">an article</a> by Dan Robinson of The Register, Wi-Fi 6E products might not be taking off because of the lack of endpoint options which in turn might be due to the chip shortage, concerns about spectrum utilization regulations being inconsistent globally, and interference from equipment already operating in the 6 GHz spectrum.</p><p id="7261">These numbers provide some useful macro context but I was curious what the environment around me looked like. I thought that the quickest way to do that was to make a simple Wi-Fi survey kit and check what was collected.</p><h2 id="1a17">Where’s that Wi-Fi?</h2><p id="df1e">My goals were to find a single board computer (SBC) that was relatively inexpensive, small (wallet sized), USB-PD compatible, and of course, able to monitor 802.11ax frames. I ran into some challenges finding hardware with many suitable options being out of stock or too expensive. I ended up going with the DFRobot LattePanda Delta 432 which, at $259 was about the most I’d want to pay for this little project. The computer didn’t have an 802.11ax capable wireless interface but having an <a href="https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000144170/how-to-distinguish-the-differences-between-m-2-cards" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">M.2 A/E-keyed socket</a>, it was easy enough to add a $26 <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/189347/intel-wifi-6-ax200-gig/specifications.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Intel AX200 module</a>. I had a protective case and a portable battery sitting around so all I needed to do was configure the device to collect Wi-Fi frames. I decided to add a GPS receiver to the kit in the instance that I find something interesting that I might later want to check out again.</p><p id="b9b8">Given everything that I wanted the kit to do, <a href="https://www.kismetwireless.net/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Kismet</a> was the perfect tool for the job and rather quickly I had it installed and configured on the LattePanda Delta 432 running Ubuntu 20.04. After performing a few tests at home I set out with the kit on foot to start my survey.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p><img alt="Image showing 93 Wi-Fi channels/channel widths the Kismet program is configured to capture traffic on." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Xf7iWhqOZajD5w-3EaXE4g.png" width="700" height="85"/></p></div><figcaption>The 93 channels/channel widths configured for capture via Kismet.</figcaption></figure><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*IM5FJR8DDszOCpUbHKnkxQ.png" width="700" height="320" role="presentation"/></p></div><figcaption>Web client view of Kismet capture during testing at home.</figcaption></figure><p id="b8c6">In order to maximum my efficiency, I attempted to walk in the most densely populated locations in my area which turned out to be the middle of Washington, DC. My theory was that the greater the human density, the higher likelihood of encountering APs. I also attempted to survey both residential and commercial areas (informed using US Census Bureau and DC Government zoning data).</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*cHomltwz0CNHDHb3Wlw8Lw.png" width="700" height="687" role="presentation"/></p></div><figcaption>I tried to make sense of a DC Government <a href="https://maps.dcoz.dc.gov/images/FullZoningMap_2020-11.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">zoning map</a> to get a good mix of resident, commercial, and mixed use space as I planned a walking survey route. Data source: DC Government.</figcaption></figure><p id="2f56">8.3 miles, 301 MB of captured data, and one averted thunder storm later it was time to begin the analysis. I decided to look for APs specifically instead of client devices (non-AP STA) such as phones, laptops, printers, and IoT devices. I did this for a couple reasons:</p><ul><li id="136d">I figured if I focus on APs I could also get stats on Wi-Fi 6, Wi-Fi 6E, WPA3, and Management Frame Protection (MFP) all in one place via Beacon frames. Also, identifying AP manufacturers and models will likely be easier since the BSSID can likely infer the manufacturer and often times vendor specific data will be present in Beacon frames that can list manufacturer and model information.</li><li id="ecc2">Americans typically tend to replace their smartphones every <a href="https://www.refurb.me/blog/what-is-the-average-replacement-cycle-and-lifespan-of-a-smartphone" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">2–2.5 years</a>. According to ScientiaMobile’s Mobile Overview Report (MOVR) for 2021-Q4 (October-December 2021), at least 17.37% of North American phones are Wi-Fi 6 capable. That number is likely much higher in the United States specifically and grew in 2022-Q4, especially following the top 3 Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) in the country <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/buy-a-free-iphone-13-with-trade-in-everything-to-know-about-verizon-t-mobile-and-at-ts-deals/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">advertising device trade-ins</a> for new phones supporting Wi-Fi 6. If you purchased a phone in the US since <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_note10_and_note10_are_the_first_wifi_certified_6_smartphones-news-39218.php" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">late 2019</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_11" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">early 2020</a> to present there’s a decent chance you are able to use Wi-Fi 6. I think smartphone Wi-Fi 6 adoption has been progressing well. Being able to get quarterly data on device sales and use for phones isn’t typically hard to come by. What I’m curious about is how many phones aren’t able to utilize Wi-Fi 6 because they don’t have any APs to connect to.</li><li id="38d9">Given the rise of <a href="https://www.mist.com/get-to-know-mac-address-randomization-in-2020/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">localized MAC address utilization</a> in mobile client devices like phones, tablets, and laptops, device identification and de-duplication is a bit trickier. Plus, given some of the technical challenges in capturing a specific client/AP Resource Unit (RU), it’s best to avoid the client perspective.</li><li id="da8d">Finding devices and ensuring a good sample will be easier both the collector and collectee aren’t both moving. I expect most APs that I came across to be static from my perspective as I walked by but I think I’ll find some exceptions like in-car Wi-Fi networks and mobile network hotspots.</li><li id="aca2">I have a theory that given the <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1611/1611.00861.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">monetary cost and power cost of more modern Wi-Fi chips</a>, IoT devices likely aren’t driving the adoption of Wi-Fi 6. My thinking is that such equipment likely uses older, less expensive, more abundant, and less speedy Wi-Fi standards like IEEE 802.11b/g/n (if the equipment uses Wi-Fi at all in lieu of Bluetooth Low Energy or Zigbee). The WFA’s data backs this up too — the top three categories of certified products were Routers (1119), Phones (655), and Computers &amp; Accessories (293). A canvas of the top selling home &amp; consumer IoT devices in the United States confirmed my hunch. Only one device I came across supports Wi-Fi 6, the <a href="https://www.developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/device-specifications-fire-tv-streaming-media-player.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max — 1st Gen (2021)</a>.</li></ul><p id="0e43">After settling on Beacon frames only I started preparing the data. I go back and forth on my analysis tools, alternating between using Wireshark itself and exporting the data and exploring it with Microsoft Excel or Jupyter Notebook.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><p><img alt="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Z6JtAzHPp2foBGpQOcEugA.png" width="700" height="816" role="presentation"/></p></div><figcaption>Plotting a random sample of discovered APs that have GPS coordinates in their frame from Kismet (n=3000).</figcaption></figure><h2 id="a50c">Finding High Efficiency (HE) Wi-Fi, efficiently</h2><p id="8a61">During my survey I came across <strong>40,886</strong> unique BSSIDs. Of those, <strong>8,622 (21.09%)</strong> listed HE Capability and HE Operation Information Elements (IEs) in Beacon frames, identifying them as Wi-Fi 6 capable STAs. Effectively, one in five APs I walked by could support Wi-Fi 6. About 16.2% of Wi-Fi 6 capable STAs advertised support for Access Network Query Protocol (ANQP) meaning additional information about the STA such as its venue’s name, domain name, operator’s name, and authentication details could potentially be queried.</p><p id="ecfd">The manufacturers of the Wi-Fi 6 APs that I could definitively resolve are:</p><ul><li id="1f51">ARRIS Group, Inc.

It was a best effort attempt to see what degree of device usage was detectable in a given urban area from a simple survey. There were many variables I didn’t control for and my means of sampling could have been skewed by such things as building occupancy/utilization rates, tenant/owner wealth, day time of capture, collection dwell time, and type of structures present on the route.</li><li id="3649">Due to Wi-Fi 6’s use of Orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) <a href="https://gjermundraaen.com/2020/09/23/my-thoughts-on-802-11ax-ofdma-capturing-in-the-future/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">some data</a> <a href="https://mac-wifi.com/will-we-be-able-to-capture-802-11ax-frames/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">could have</a> been missed by the monitoring card which wasn’t necessarily near the AP or the client device. While this might be true if I was attempting to collect a full, uninterrupted data stream of all AP traffic this isn’t an issue with Beacon frames. It is far more likely that I would have missed networks due to signal attenuation or because Kismet was channel hopping. Given my configuration it takes Kismet about 19 seconds to cycle through all 93 channel/channel-width combinations. In that time I’d cover about 70–90 feet of distance. There were also dwell times as I waited at intersections or for vehicles to enter/leave alleys and garages.</li><li id="2cf7">Kismet was not collecting on all possible channels/channel widths so it is possible some networks (e.g., 160 MHz HE STAs) were missed.</li></ul><p id="d970">I’m including the full list of hardware and software I used to make the survey kit as well as the general directions I used to configure the system.</p><h2 id="8606">Hardware List</h2><ul><li id="73b0"><a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/dfrobot/DFR0544/9586651" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">DFRobot LattePanda Delta 432</a> (Digi-Key)</li><li id="d8d2"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089D4176K/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Anker A1291 737 Power Bank (PowerCore III Elite 26K)</a> (Amazon)</li><li id="8333"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085M7VPDP" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Intel AX200 Wi-Fi 6 (Gig+) Desktop Kit</a> (Amazon)</li><li id="025d"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008200LHW" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">GlobalSat BU-353-S4 USB GPS Receiver</a> (Amazon)</li><li id="f132"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002INQT2" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Pelican 1200 Case</a> (Amazon)</li></ul><h2 id="1c76">Software List</h2><ul><li id="b3c5"><a href="https://www.kismetwireless.net/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Kismet</a></li><li id="c1b4"><a href="https://gpsd.io/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">gpsd</a></li><li id="22f4"><a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Ubuntu (20.04)</a></li></ul><h2 id="ffad">Kit Configuration</h2><p id="fc27"><strong>General System Configuration</strong></p><blockquote><p id="a9b5"># apt update -y</p></blockquote><p id="3e34"><strong>Kismet (/etc/kismet/kismet.conf) — edit</strong></p><blockquote><p id="9dbb">gps=gpsd:host=localhost,port=2947</p></blockquote><p id="5cbf"><strong>udev (/etc/udev/rules.d/80-gps.rules) — create + add</strong></p><blockquote><p id="2f02"><em>SUBSYSTEM==”usb”, ACTION=”add”, ATTRS{idVendor}==”067b”, ATTRS{idProduct}==”2303&#34;, NAME=”gps”</em></p></blockquote><p id="8ed4"><strong>gpsd (/etc/defaults/gpsd) — edit</strong></p><blockquote><p id="35fb">GPSD_OPTIONS=”-D 5 -n /dev/gps1&#34;</p></blockquote><p id="8e4f"><strong>cloud-init (/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml) — create + add</strong></p><blockquote><p id="5200">network:</p></blockquote><p id="84f2"><em>Do you have any questions, comments, constructive feedback, or things to discuss?
