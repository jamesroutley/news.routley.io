<p><strong>A comprehensive daily press review with global news. Fully private, with sources openly curated by our community.</strong></p>

<p>News is broken. We all know it, but we’ve somehow accepted it as inevitable. The endless notifications. The clickbait headlines designed to trigger rather than inform, driven by relentless ad monetization. The exhausting cycle of checking multiple apps throughout the day, only to feel more anxious and less informed than when we started. This isn’t what news was supposed to be.
We can do better, and create what news should have been all along: pure, essential information that respects your intelligence and time.</p>

<h2>Our approach: Signal over noise</h2>

<p><a href="https://kite.kagi.com">Kagi News</a> operates on a simple principle: understanding the world requires hearing from the world. Every day, our system reads thousands of community curated RSS feeds from publications across different viewpoints and perspectives. We then distill this massive information into one comprehensive daily briefing, while clearly citing sources.</p>

<p>We strive for diversity and transparency of resources and welcome your contributions to widen perspectives. This multi-source approach helps reveal the full picture beyond any single viewpoint.</p>

<h2>Design principles that put readers first</h2>

<p><strong>One daily update:</strong> We publish once per day around noon UTC, creating a natural endpoint to news consumption. This is a deliberate design choice that turns news from an endless habit into a contained ritual.</p>

<p><strong>Five-minute complete understanding:</strong> Our briefings cover everything important in just five minutes. No endless scrolling. No attention hijacking. You read, understand, and move on with your day.</p>

<p><strong>Diversity over echo chambers:</strong> Rather than personalizing feeds to match existing preferences, we expose readers to the full spectrum of global perspectives. This approach breaks down information silos instead of reinforcing them.</p>

<p><strong>Privacy by design:</strong> Your reading habits belong to you. We don’t track, profile, or monetize your attention. You remain the customer and not the product.</p>

<p><strong>Community-driven sources:</strong> Our news sources are open source and community-curated through our public GitHub repository. Anyone can propose additions, flag problems, or suggest improvements.</p>

<p><strong>Customizable:</strong> In your settings, you can select and reorder categories to match your interests and priorities. You can also adjust the number of stories shown, as well as dragging to re-order various sections, so that your briefing is focused on the depth and topics that matter most to you.</p>

<p><strong>News in your language:</strong> You can choose your preferred interface and content language. News stories are generated in their original source language, and then translated using Kagi Translate. The default mode shows regional stories in their original language without translation, and all other ones in your browser’s language.</p>

<h2>Technical implementation that respects publishers</h2>

<p>We don’t scrape content from websites. Instead, we use publicly available RSS feeds that publishers choose to provide. Publishers decide what content appears in their feeds; some include full articles, others only titles or summaries. We respect those choices completely. We’re working within the ecosystem publishers have created rather than circumventing their intentions.</p>

The onslaught of information and opinions always felt like a waste of my precious time. This app is on a great track to cut through the noise.”"/></p>
