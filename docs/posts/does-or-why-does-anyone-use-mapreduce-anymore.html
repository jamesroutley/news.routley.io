    <h1>Ask HN: Does (or why does) anyone use MapReduce anymore?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Excluding the Hadoop ecosystem, I see some references to MapReduce in other database and analysis tools (e.g., MatLab). My perception was that Spark completely superseded MapReduce. Are there just different implementations of MapReduce and the one that Hadoop implemented was replaced by Spark?</p></div></div>
