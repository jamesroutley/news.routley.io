    <h1>how to only torrent through a vpn</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How can you make sure that you never accidentally have your torrent client on but your VPN off? You can <strong>restrict the
network interface that your torrent client uses to that of your VPN</strong>.</p><p>To ensure privacy while torrenting legal content, you’ve probably heard the endless ads on podcasts and Youtube for
using a VPN. This article assumes you already have a VPN and know how to turn it on and off.</p><p>A network interface is the point of connection between a computer and a network that may be connected to the rest of the
world. Your VPN will have its own dedicated network interface, and <strong>for some torrent clients, you can specify to only
ever use that network interface for torrent traffic</strong>.</p><p>First, find the network interface used by your VPN as follows:</p><ol><li>Turn off your torrent client and VPN.</li><li>Open a terminal (Terminal App on MacOS, Command Prompt for Windows).</li><li>Run <code>ifconfig</code> (or <code>ipconfig</code> for Windows).</li><li>The short names on the left of the output are your network interfaces. For example, <code>lo0</code> below.</li></ol><pre tabindex="0"><code>❯ ifconfig
lo0: flags=8049&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt; mtu 16384
</code></pre><ol start="5"><li>Turn on your VPN.</li><li>Run <code>ifconfig</code> (or <code>ipconfig</code>) again. There should be a new network interface that wasn’t present before. That is the
network interface for your VPN. Note down the name of that new network interface.</li></ol><p>Now time to tell your torrent client to only ever use that network interface. Note that not all torrent clients support
this action. I’ll show the process for <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/">qBittorrent</a>, which does support it.</p><ol><li>Turn on your VPN.</li><li>Open qBittorrent, then open its Preferences.</li><li>Go to “Advanced”.</li><li>Under the setting Network Interface, select the network interface name used by your VPN and hit “OK”.</li></ol><p>Torrent traffic will now only flow if your VPN is on and connected.</p></div></div>
