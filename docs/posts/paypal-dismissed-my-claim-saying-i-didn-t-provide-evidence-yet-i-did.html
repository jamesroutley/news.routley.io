    <h1>Ask HN: PayPal dismissed my claim, saying I didn&#39;t provide evidence (yet I did)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Hi.<p>I apologize in advance, but it looks like it&#39;s my turn for social media big tech support.</p><p>I had a situation where OVH abused a PayPal authorization to charge me 1200€ for a &#34;private cloud&#34; credit I never asked. OVH refuses to refund me changing the reason for it every time, but well, that&#39;s another topic.</p><p>I filed a PayPal dispute, I added exchanges with OVH as evidence, where they constantly insist on me having this &#34;credit&#34; still available for me to use, and my insisting on not wanting it for any purpose (the 12€ I added were enough for my test) and not having ordered it.</p><p>Finally, PayPal ruled in favor of OVH claiming that I &#34;never provided documentation to prove this credit&#34;.</p><p>Not only I did (OVH messages), but nobody asked me for evidence at any point: I could have provided extra information/screenshots where it is shown. I am positive OVH was requested multiple times for documentation to support their claims, but that was never the case for me, not sure if that&#39;s normal.</p><p>Now I&#39;m stuck with an absurd amount of credit on a cloud service I have no use for (and worse, it expires in a year), and apparently there&#39;s no UI option for me to contest this PayPal ruling. Phoning them I found no option to talk to a person.</p><p>Other than lawyering up and contacting consumer protection organisations, what else is there to do? Anyone at PayPal can give me a hint?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p></div></div>
