    <h1>List animals until failure</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="rules">
        <summary>List as many animals as you can.</summary>
        <p><b>Animals must have Wikipedia articles.</b>
        </p><p><b>You have limited time, but get more time for each animal listed.</b> When the timer runs out, that&#39;s game over.
        </p><p><b>No overlapping terms.</b>
           For example, if you list “bear” and “polar bear”, you get no point (or time bonus) for the latter.
           But you can still get a point for a second kind of bear. Order doesn&#39;t matter.
        </p><p id="visualshint"><b>Ignore the extraneous visuals.</b>
           Focus on naming animals.
