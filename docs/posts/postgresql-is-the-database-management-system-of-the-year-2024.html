Second in the rankings was Snowflake, followed by Microsoft in third place. PostgreSQL has emerged as the most popular database management system over the past year, outpacing all other 423 monitored systems. </p>

<p>Nearly 35 years ago, the database system known as Postgres made its debut. Since then, PostgreSQL has undergone significant transformations, driven by a continuous stream of enhancements that ensure it remains at the cutting edge of DBMS technology, while also offering a dependable and stable platform. PostgreSQL 17, launched in September 2024, introduced additional performance enhancements and expanded replication options, among other improvements. All of this continues to make PostgreSQL one of the most successful open-source projects ever. </p>

<p>Snowflake is the runner up and is a cloud-based data warehousing company that has gained significant traction in recent years. Its unique architecture allows for the separation of storage and compute, providing flexibility and scalability. Snowflake&#39;s support for multi-cloud environments and its data sharing capabilities have made it a popular choice for businesses looking to leverage cloud data warehousing. Snowflake&#39;s rise in the rankings reflects its growing influence and adoption in the industry. </p>

<p>Microsoft&#39;s Azure SQL Database and SQL Server continue to be strong contenders in the DBMS market. Azure SQL Database offers a fully managed relational database with AI-powered performance optimization and scalability. SQL Server, with its hybrid capabilities, allows for seamless integration between on-premises and cloud environments. Microsoft&#39;s commitment to innovation and its comprehensive suite of data services have solidified its position in the top ranks. </p>

<h2><big>Notes to editors</big></h2>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>We calculate the DBMS of the year by subtracting the January 2024 from the January 2025 scores. We use the difference between each DBMS’s score, rather than a percentage growth, which would favor systems with lower popularity at the beginning of the year. The DMBS of the year is an illustration of how much each system increased in popularity during the year. You can read more about our exact <a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking_definition">methodology </a>here, but in short we are ranking popularity of DBMS based on how much people are discussing and communicating about each system, including job offers, professional profile entries and citations on the web. job offers, professional profile entries and citations on the web. </p>
