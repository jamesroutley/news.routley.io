    <h1>Show HN: A 5th order motion planner with PH spline blending, written in Ada</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Prunt is an advanced open-source motion control system targetted at 3D printers.
Prunt includes features not found in other popular open-source systems, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corner blending with user defined deviation.</li>
<li>Constrained and independently adjustable velocity, acceleration, jerk, snap, and crackle.</li>
<li>Pinout data provided by the board to eliminate the need to edit pin mappings in a configuration file.</li>
<li>Built-in GUI for configuration editing without the need to ever edit configuration files directly.</li>
<li>Safer and faster homing by defining maximum overshoot distance instead of speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also sell our own hardware with features not present on most consumer 3D printing hardware:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully isolated USB to protect upstream devices.</li>
<li>Reverse polarity protection.</li>
<li>Protection against electrical shorts to 24V on most exposed pins.</li>
<li>Individual hardware timers for every stepper, allowing for precise step timings.</li>
<li>Support for 2-pin and 4-pin fans on the same ports.</li>
<li>Fail-safe firmware updates, eliminating the need to ever install a jumper.</li>
<li>Hardware counters for high speed fan tachometers.</li>
<li>Soft-start to allow a wider range of power supplies.</li>
<li>PT1000 support without jumpers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently we are selling a small number of units for those who want to beta test our hardware.
These are early units for people that want to mess with new hardware and firmware, theyâ€™re not currently suited to people that want a product that just works.
This is reflected in the price of $100 USD being far below the BOM cost, so expect these to be more expensive in the future, but potentially have issues now.
Send an email to <a href="mailto:liam@prunt3d.com">liam@prunt3d.com</a> if you would like to purchase one of these early units.</p>
