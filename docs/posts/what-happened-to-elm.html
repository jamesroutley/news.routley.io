    <h1>Ask HN: What Happened to Elm?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I remember years ago I spent sometime to learn it as I was curious how a purely functional front-end language feels like, and genuinely thought it had a good chance of being massively adapted in the near future, especially with what seemed like a vibrant community.</p><p>However, I got distracted by a data science career and toolchain. Am in the process of starting my first SaaS as a solo founder and was looking at what languages to use and was surprised to see that Elm...seems dead? As an example I did a search on hackernews and it hardly got mentioned in the last year (both comments and posts!)</p><p>Am wondering if anyone can provide some more light on what happened to the language? Is it a safe bet? And what is a suitable good replacement for it?</p></div></div></div>
