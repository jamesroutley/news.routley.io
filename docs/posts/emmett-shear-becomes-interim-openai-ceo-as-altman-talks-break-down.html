    <h1>Emmett Shear becomes interim OpenAI CEO as Altman talks break down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>After a weekend of negotiations to bring back Sam Altman as OpenAI CEO following his shock firing, the company’s nonprofit board has gone another way entirely and named former Twitch CEO Emmett Shear as interim CEO. Shear will take over as CEO from Mira Murati, who was publicly aligned with Altman. The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/breaking-sam-altman-will-not-return-as-ceo-of-openai?utm_source=ti_app&amp;rc=k5vrz1"><em>The Information</em></a>.</p><p>That’s three CEOs in three days, if you’re keeping track.</p><p>The hiring of Shear appears to close the door on Altman’s exit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired">after he was fired Friday</a> when the board said he had not been “consistently candid in his communications.” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/18/23967199/breaking-openai-board-in-discussions-with-sam-altman-to-return-as-ceo">As we reported Saturday</a>, the board quickly began discussing his return under pressure from investors and the threat of a mass employee walkout. </p><p>On Saturday night, sources told <em>The Verge</em> that the remaining board members had missed a 5PM PT deadline to resign and reinstate Altman and fellow co-founder Greg Brockman or face a slew of staff resignations. After the deadline passed, droves of OpenAI employees started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/19/23968027/why-openai-employees-were-posting-all-those-heart-emojis">posting their support</a> for Altman on social media.</p><p>Altman returned to OpenAI’s office this morning saying it would be the “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/19/23968162/its-the-endgame-for-sam-altmans-potential-return-to-openai">first and last time</a>” he wore a guest badge, implying that he would either return as CEO or not set foot in the building again.</p><p>OpenAI’s profile has skyrocketed since the launch of ChatGPT. The company’s valuation <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-seeks-new-valuation-of-up-to-90-billion-in-sale-of-existing-shares-ed6229e0">reportedly</a> reached $80 to $90 billion in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Altman announced that the service has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948386/chatgpt-active-user-count-openai-developer-conference">over 100 million</a> weekly users.</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p></div></div></div>
