    <h1>Why do cloud providers keep building datacenters in the America&#39;s hottest city?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>With more than a hundred 100F (37.7C) days a year and a persistent drought, on paper Phoenix, Arizona is one of the last places you&#39;d expect to find cloud and colocation providers setting down roots.</p>
<p>Yet, Google has just <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2023/07/10/google-starts-construction-data-center-mesa.html" rel="nofollow">broken ground</a> on a $1 billion, 750,000 square feet datacenter campus in Mesa, east of Phoenix and to the west in Goodyear, Microsoft has a five-datacenter campus under <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/11/microsoft_evaporative_coolers_arizona/">development</a>.</p>
<p>So what gives? Why would two of the largest cloud providers choose to build datacenters — facilities that require copious amounts of land, power, and a huge amount of water — in such a hot and arid place?</p>

    

<p>Say what you will about it being a dry heat, but there&#39;s a lot going for the region, according to Omdia analyst Alan Howard who tracks the datacenter market and also happens to live in Phoenix.</p>
<h3>What a datacenter needs</h3>
<p>Datacenters exist to make money, either by hosting servers in the case of a colo or on-prem facilities or the workloads services themselves in the case of the cloud, and this means a confluence of factors need to align for a location to be economical.</p>
<p>Of course, we can&#39;t talk about construction without touching property cost and tax incentives. As a general rule, datacenter operators like to build where land, operational costs, and taxes are low.</p>

        


        

<p>A state bill <a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/75304" rel="nofollow">signed</a> into law in early 2021, extended tax breaks on the use, installation, assembly, repair or maintenance of datacenter equipment, for most Arizona datacenter valued in excess of $25 million through 2033. However, cheap land and favorable tax incentives aren&#39;t the only thing cloud providers are looking for.</p>
<p>&#34;The tax incentives are clearly appealing… but Arizona isn&#39;t the only state that offers those kinds of tax incentives,&#34; Howard said.</p>

</ul>
<p>Access to power is another important factor. When you consider a cloud datacenter campus might be rated for north of 60 megawatts, saving a fraction of a cent could translate into millions in savings a year. And while at $0.078 a kilowatt-hour, Phoenix&#39;s power isn&#39;t as cheap as Washington State, which is closer to $0.04 a kWh, but it&#39;s still competitive, Howard said.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more attractive, given the recent emphasis around datacenter sustainability, is where Phoenix gets its power from. The state has a pretty healthy mix of nuclear and sustainable power and is home to the largest nuclear power plant, the Palo Verde Generating Station with a net capacity of 32 million megawatt-hours. And while more than half the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/state/print.php?sid=AZ#:~:text=In%202022%2C%2099%25%20of%20Arizona&#39;s,%25)%3A%20and%20wind%20(1%25" rel="nofollow">region&#39;s power</a> still comes from fossil fuels (12 percent coal and 42 percent natural gas), 46 percent comes from other sources.</p>

        

<p>Of course, all the property, tax incentives, and power you ever want won&#39;t do cloud providers much good if it&#39;s in the middle of nowhere. Latency is still a factor and cloud providers like to spread their datacenters out to serve broad geographic regions. In the case of the Phoenix, that&#39;s the American Southwest, which is home to just shy of a <a href="https://cis.org/Population-Immigration-and-Drying-American-Southwest" rel="nofollow">fifth</a> of the US population.</p>
<p>However, proximity won&#39;t do much good if you don&#39;t have adequate connectivity to support them. &#34;Phoenix has a nice dense east-west fiber that makes connectivity in the region very appealing,&#34; Howard explained.</p>
<h3>The water problem</h3>
<p>The crux, of course, is water.</p>
<p>The city&#39;s water supply is located roughly 150 miles away, according to the <a href="https://www.srpnet.com/grid-water-management/water-management/where-water-from" rel="nofollow">Salt River Project</a>. Making matters worse, Arizona is in the midst of the worst <a href="https://www.phoenix.gov/waterservices/resourcesconservation/drought-information" rel="nofollow">drought</a> in more than 110 years, and this is a problem for how datacenter operators like to cool their facilities, which involves evaporating lots of water.</p>
<p>As we learned last year, Google&#39;s datacenters in Dalles, Oregon <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/19/google_datacenters_dalles/">consumed</a> more than a quarter of the city&#39;s water supply — 274.5 million gallons or about 1.2 billion liters —  in 2021.</p>

        

<p>This is usually done using evaporative coolers, which work by passing hot air through what&#39;s essentially a large, damp sponge. As the water evaporates it strips away the heat and cools the air. Evaporative coolers are favored because they tend to use a lot less power than alternative means and only need to be run during the hottest months of the year.</p>
<p>But as we reported in April, Microsoft has had to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/04/11/microsoft_evaporative_coolers_arizona/">abandon</a> the technology at its upcoming datacenters in Goodyear, Arizona in favor of a more water conscious option. But while the software giant pitched the change as a sustainability win, the reality was that the company&#39;s existing datacenters were already putting a strain on the local wastewater plant. The part Microsoft didn&#39;t mention was that alternative cooling methods tend to use quite a bit more power and will need to run year round.</p>
<p>We&#39;re told that Google&#39;s new datacenter in Mesa will follow suit, with a company spokesperson telling <em>The Register</em> that the facility won&#39;t rely on evaporative coolers and therefore should have a negligible impact on local water supplies. ®</p>
