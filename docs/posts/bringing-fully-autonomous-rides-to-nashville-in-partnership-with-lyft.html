    <h1>Bringing fully autonomous rides to Nashville, in partnership with Lyft</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article aria-labelledby="P0-7-title"><div><p>We’re on our way to Music City! We’re excited to bring the magic of Waymo’s fully autonomous ride-hailing service to riders in Nashville, in partnership with Lyft.</p><p>Our generalizable Waymo Driver has become even more capable as we’ve scaled to hundreds of thousands of fully autonomous rides each week across five major U.S. cities. We’ll start fully autonomous operations in Nashville in the coming months, and open to public riders next year. We’ll do so by pairing our world-leading technology and seamless ride-hailing service with Lyft’s proven track record of fleet management through its Flexdrive subsidiary.</p><p>We’re also excited to offer riders in Nashville even more ways to ride with Waymo. Riders will hail via the Waymo app, and as our service grows, riders will also be able to use the Lyft app to match with a Waymo vehicle. We’re thrilled for even more people to have access to our ride-hailing service, as we work towards our mission to be the world’s most trusted driver.</p><p>“We’re delighted to partner with Lyft and launch in Nashville next year, as we continue to scale our Waymo ride-hailing service to more people in more places,” said Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana. “Lyft’s extensive fleet management capabilities through Flexdrive make them an ideal partner for expanding to Nashville. We can’t wait to introduce Music City’s residents and visitors to the convenient, consistent, safe, and magical Waymo experience.”</p><p>&#34;This partnership brings together best-in-class autonomous vehicles with best-in-class customer experience,&#34; said Lyft CEO David Risher. &#34;Waymo has proven that its autonomous technology works at scale. When combined with Lyft&#39;s customer-obsession and world-class fleet management capabilities, it&#39;s two great tastes that go great together.&#34;</p><p>With more than 100 million fully autonomous miles driven on public roads, the <a href="https://waymo.com/safety/impact/"><u>data</u></a> shows Waymo’s technology is significantly safer than human drivers in the areas where we operate. Nashville joins a growing list of cities that will soon have access to Waymo.</p><p>“As families and businesses move to Tennessee in record numbers, our state continues to lead the nation in finding innovative solutions to transportation challenges,&#34; said Governor Bill Lee.<b> </b>&#34;By leveraging private sector technologies like Waymo&#39;s fully autonomous vehicles, we&#39;re exploring possibilities we couldn&#39;t achieve on our own, and further accelerating economic growth. I look forward to Waymo&#39;s launch in The Volunteer State.”</p><p>We’re looking forward to serving the people of Nashville soon.
