    <h1>Scheme Macros I: Modules</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>One of the most powerful—and, for a large part of the programmer community, most dreaded—features of Lisp is its metaprogramming. In this series I&#39;ll attempt to give a few interesting cases for how we can level up our code through the use of macros.</p>
<p>This time we will look at how to implement a module system. Many Lisps already come with a module system out of the box—both <a href="http://trac.sacrideo.us/wg/wiki/ModuleSystems">R7RS</a> and <a href="http://weitz.de/packages.html">Common Lisp</a> provide a facility for packaging and namespacing libraries and modules—, but it is still helpful to know how these abstractions are built and how they look on the inside.</p>
<p>The module system we&#39;re about to implement is a stripped-down, simplified version of the actual <a href="https://github.com/zepto-lang/module">zepto module system</a>. The complete code used in this post can be downloaded <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/assets/modules.zp">here</a>.</p>
<p>This post assumes a certain familiarity with the <code>define-syntax</code> Scheme form.</p>
<h2 id="an-api">An API</h2>
<p>As per usual in my tutorial-style blog posts, we&#39;re going to go the route of first defining an API and then trying to implement it. Let&#39;s look at a simple module and its defining syntax.</p>
<pre><code>(defmodule math
  (export add sub (m :as mul))

  ; Optional requires through a (require ...) form

  (define (op f x y) (f x y))

  (define (add x y) (op + x y))
  (define (sub x y) (op - x y))
  (define (m x y) (op * x y)))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 1: Defining a module.
</p>
<p>Now, the aesthetics of this are obviously in the eye of the beholder, but this system provides us with all of the facilities a module system is generally expected to provide. What about importing defined modules then?</p>
<pre><code>; import functions take the form &lt;namespace&gt;:&lt;function&gt;
; will import everything in the module
(import math)

; will import everything in the module namespaced as m
(import math m)

; will only import the add function from math
(import math:add)

; will only import the add function from math, aliased
(import math:add math:add-renamed)</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 2: Importing from a module.
</p>
<p>These are the basic building blocks we need for importing from a module. We can even rename things if we want to!</p>
<p>This API might not be as simple as it could be, but it is as capable a module system as I usually need. In fact, in many ways it is better than the system zepto has today, because this version has way less cruft and a better user interface, at least in my opinion. We also return the function implementation from the call to <code>import</code>, because we can get it for free<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> and it might be useful.</p>
<p>This concludes our little overview over the API. Let&#39;s get down to business!</p>
<h2 id="here-be-dragons-but-theyre-tame">Here be dragons, but they&#39;re tame</h2>
<p>There are many ways to represent modules in your language. The single most intuitive way to implement them, however, is storing them as a nested hash map in my opinion. The outer keys are the module names, whose values are inner hashmaps of function names to functions.</p>
<p>If we compile the module from Figure 1 manually, we might—in JSON-like notation—end up with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
  &#34;math&#34;: {
    &#34;add&#34;: /* some function representation */,
    &#34;sub&#34;: /* some function representation */,
    &#34;mul&#34;: /* some function representation */
   }
}</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 3: A representation of a module.
</p>
<p>Something interesting is going on here already, because the function <code>m</code> has already been renamed to <code>mul</code>. Why is that? We can be sure that we never refer to it by its old name, because in a perfect world, the module user wouldn&#39;t even know that it was aliased. They&#39;d just see that there is a function called <code>mul</code> in the module.</p>
<p>In zepto, the module system is just one big hashmap called <code>*modules*</code> that we operate on. This gives us no thread safety—although I hope importing modules will never lead to race conditions—, but enables us to write our own module system easily if we have to. It also leaves the possibility of monkey-patching open to the user, although I was never a big fan of that concept. Ruby users might disagree.</p>
<h2 id="defining-a-module">Defining a module</h2>
<p>How do we go from the module definition in Figure 1 to an entry in our hash map, then? Macros, of course. Let&#39;s define a macro <code>defmodule</code> that takes in the definition above and just evaluates the module body in a new scope.</p>
<pre><code>(define-syntax defmodule
  (syntax-rules (export)
    ((module name (export exports ...) body ...)
      (let ()
        body ...))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 4: A module system, well almost.
</p>
<p>The <code>body ...</code> form will expand to the module body, meaning that we evaluate it in a <code>let</code> form that binds no new variables. This is a short trick to define a new scope and assures that the functions don&#39;t leak. If they did, we wouldn&#39;t define much of a module system.</p>
<p>All we need now is to take the exported forms and put them in the hash maps. Their closures will persist, meaning that the non-exported functions and variables will live on without leaking out of their defined scope.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s try to make a skeleton of how we would set the values in the hash map, using zepto&#39;s <code>hash:set!</code> function which updates a hash map&#39;s key-value pair destructively.</p>
<pre><code>(define-syntax defmodule
  (syntax-rules (export)
    ((module name (export exports ...) body ...)
      (let ()
        body ...
        (hash:set! *modules* (-&gt;string &#39;name)
          (make-hash
              ; produce values here
        ))))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 5: An update skeleton.
</p>
<p>The function <code>hash:set!</code> takes three arguments: the hash map, the key—here a string representation of the module name–, and a value. In this case, we know that the value will be a hash map, so I already put the <code>make-hash</code> function in the skeleton. <code>make-hash</code> in zepto can also operate on a list of key-value pairs, which we will leverage. But how do we generate a list of key-value pairs—in this case a list of names and functions?</p>
<p>In this macro, we already have a list of names that we want to export, helpfully called <code>exports</code>. This means that all we have to do is a list transformation, which sounds a lot like an application of <code>map</code>. Using <code>map</code> and the zepto shorthand for unary lambdas <code>$</code>—it will bind the argument to <code>%</code>—we arrive at the following transformation:</p>
<pre><code>(map
  ($ (if (list? %)
       ; the aliasing case
       (list (-&gt;string (caddr %)) (eval (car %)))
       ; the regular case
       (list (-&gt;string %) (eval %))))
  &#39;(exports ...)))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 6: A convoluted list transformation
</p>
<p>This definition packs a punch, so let&#39;s walk through it slowly. An illustrative example to make this clearer can be found in Figure 7. We go over the list in export one by one. In each iteration of the mapping function, the element will be bound to <code>%</code>, as mentioned before. If it is a list, we assume that it is an aliased form—defined as <code>(foo :as bar)</code>—, which means that the list will be a pair of the last element <code>(caddr %)</code> as a string and the implementation of the original name, which we get by evaluating the symbol. If <code>%</code> is not a list, however, we just stringify the symbol for naming it and evaluate it to get the implementation. This might not make immediate sense, and I arrived at it step by step, but this concludes our definition of <code>defmodule</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(exports add sub (m :as mul))
;; =&gt;
&#39;((add &lt;function: add&gt;) (sub &lt;function: sub&gt;)
  (mul &lt;function: m&gt;))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 7: Example inputs and outputs.
</p>
<p>Well, almost. In Figure 1 we also said that we can require other source files, which is not accounted for in this definition. For brevity, I won&#39;t go into a step-by-step derivation of how to do this, but it is included in the implementation that accompanies this post. You can also try to implement it yourself, if you wish, in which case I will give you the following hint to get started: if you want to load in a list of source files, you&#39;ll have to capture the environment, and then map over the files and load them into that environment. An implementation of that is given in lines 27–42 of the file I link to at the beginning of this post.</p>
<h2 id="importing">Importing</h2>
<p>Now we come to the part that makes this system actually usable: importing. Importing is simple: we retrieve the functions we stored earlier and bind them to the appropriate name. There is a renaming import and a non-renaming import in our API, let&#39;s define the renaming import first:</p>
<pre><code>(define-syntax import
  (syntax-rules ()
    ((import name) ; non renaming
      (import name name))
    ((import name as) ; renaming
      ; here be dragons
    )))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 8: We cheated.
</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t that cheating? We used a little trick to make the non-renaming case even simpler, by defining it as the renaming case, “renaming” to the real name. That&#39;s not very interesting, but it reduces code duplication by a lot.</p>
<p>What do we have to do for the renaming case then? If we look at the API for <code>import</code> from Figure 2 again, we realize that there are basically two cases: either we want to import everything from a module or a specific function. We can distinguish between those two cases by checking whether the symbol contains a colon, since this character is reserved as a separator between module and function names<a href="#2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Updating our skeleton to reflect our new insights, we end up with:</p>
<pre><code>(define-syntax import
  (synax-rules ()
    ; the non-renaming case
    ((import name as)
      (let ((strname (if (symbol? &#39;name) 
                        (-&gt;string &#39;name)
                        name)))
        (if (in? strname #\:)
          ; import single function
          ; import module
        )))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 9: A more complete skeleton.
</p>
<p>This looks reasonable, but something important is missing. By using a <code>let</code> expression, we introduce a new scope, which makes defining functions in the <code>if</code> body useless, since it will not be available in the scope above. What we need to do, thus, is capture the environment in the <code>let</code> variable capture. zepto has a mechanism for getting the current environment, <code>current-env</code>. If we bind it to a variable <code>env</code> and pass that on to <code>eval</code>, it will evaluate the expression in the environment.</p>
<p>Equipped with our new knowledge, we can try to implement importing a single function. We will need to split the module and function names, look them up in the module map, and bind the function to the given name, like this:</p>
<pre><code>(define-syntax import
  (syntax-rules ()
    ; the non-renaming case
    ((import name as)
      (let ((env (current-env))
            (strname (if (symbol? &#39;name)
                          (-&gt;string &#39;name)
                          name)))
        (if (in? strname #\:))
          (let* ((split (string:split strname #\:))
                 (_mod  (car fullname))
                 (fun   (cadr fullname)))
            (eval `(define ,(-&gt;symbol &#39;as)
                           ,((*modules* _mod) fun))
                  env))
          ; import module
        )))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 10: We&#39;re getting closer.
</p>
<p>In the above code, we&#39;re basically just piecing together information we already have into a <code>define</code> form and evaluating it in the parent context. This is indeed all we need for importing single functions. People who are not familiar with zepto might be confused by the lookup function: hash maps and vectors are callable and will return the value if given a key as argument, which is why we are applying <code>_mod</code> and <code>fun</code> to the <code>*modules*</code> variable, which houses all of our modules.</p>
<p>Importing a whole module is then just a matter of iterating over the contents of the module, getting the namespacing right, and doing our little evaluation trick to bind the functions. Let&#39;s try that as well.</p>
<pre><code>(define-syntax import
  (syntax-rules ()
    ; the non-renaming case
    ((import name as)
      (let ((env (current-env))
            (strname (if (symbol? &#39;name)
                          (-&gt;string &#39;name)
                          name)))
        (if (in? strname #\:)
          ; import single function
          (hash:kv-map
            ($
              (eval `(define ,(string-&gt;symbol
                                (++ (-&gt;string &#39;as) &#34;:&#34;
                                    (-&gt;string (car %))))
                             ,(cadr %))
                    env))
            (*modules* strname)))))))</code></pre>
<p>
Fig. 11: Importing, completed.
</p>
<p>This is again a tad wordy, but it basically does what was promised: it maps over the key-value pairs in the module—using <code>hash:kv-map</code>—and for each function stitches together a name from the key and the module name or alias, then binds that name to the function—the hash map value. This uses zepto&#39;s <code>$</code> shorthand for unary functions again.</p>
<p>And with this we are done. We have implemented the promised module system. While some bits of the code are a bit gnarly, it&#39;s not overly complex. Most of the time invested is spent on wiring that depends on the input data.</p>
<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>
<p>This has been a wild ride, but we now have a working version of a module system. It is relatively simple and limited, but serves as a good foundation for something that caters better to your needs.</p>
<p>There are a few low-hanging fruit that you could work on to get started making this the truly awesome module system your language deserves, or just as an exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>Try implementing loading required files yourself and see how your solution is different from mine.</li>
<li>Currently loading and importing are two separate steps. Write a <code>require</code> form that unifies the two in a sensible API. Maybe readd that into the former exercise.</li>
<li>Implement extending modules, i.e. being able to add functions to a module after it has been defined. An example for that can be found in the actual <a href="https://github.com/zepto-lang/module">zepto module system</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are definitely achievable, and most of them have been implemented in zepto already, so you can search for solutions if you&#39;re stuck.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading this far! This has been a fairly long blog post; I hope it was worthwhile! As the name suggests, I&#39;m planning to make these posts a series. The next thing I want to cover is generic functions through protocols—commonly known as interfaces or sometimes traits. If that sounds appealing to you, be sure to check back soon! And if you have any other macro ideas that you want me to write about, contact me.</p>

<p><span id="1">1.</span> This is an implementation detail, but as it pertains to the implementation of the API I felt like it should be mentioned.</p>
<p><span id="2">2.</span> This is not enforced by the implementation and purely based on convention.</p>
