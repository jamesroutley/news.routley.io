    <h1>The kind of company I want to be a part of</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The kind of company I want to be a part of...</p><div id="markdown-body">  <p>builds something I’m proud to sign my name on. Actually makes a difference in peoples’ lives. Has smart, humble coworker(s).</p>
<hr/>
<p>But most of all, cares enough to not do <code>(s)</code>.</p>
<p>To me, software should feel like an extension of the user.</p>
<p>Users shouldn’t feel like they’ve been dropped into a cookie cutter template - a cold, hard reminder that this is clunky, soulless machinery removed from their world.</p>
<p>Would a chef who takes pride in their work go through the pain of setting the table, understanding the patron, figuring out the breakfast they love, making the fluffiest pancakes in the world, cream and blueberries <em>exactly</em> the way they like it…<strong>but then carelessly serve it with a straw</strong>?!</p>
<p>How did it go through every function in your company, and nobody cared?</p>
<hr/>
<p>You <em>know</em> how many items are loading.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="javascript"><code><span><span>(minutes </span><span>==</span><span> 1</span><span>) </span><span>?</span><span> &#34;minute&#34;</span><span> :</span><span> &#34;minutes&#34;</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I get it, it’s more code. Too trivial. It’s extra work if you support i18n.</p>
<p><strong>But it’s okay.</strong></p>
<p>Am I overreacting? Maybe.</p>
