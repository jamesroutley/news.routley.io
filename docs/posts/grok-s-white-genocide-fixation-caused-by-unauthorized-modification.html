He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div></div></div></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After xAI’s chatbot Grok spent a few hours on Wednesday telling every X user that would listen that the claim of white genocide in South Africa is highly contentious, the company has blamed the behavior on an “unauthorized modification” to Grok’s code.</p><p>Wednesday’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667179/x-twitter-grok-ai-white-genocide-claims">hours-long outburst</a> saw Grok insert discussion of alleged white genocide in South Africa into various responses on X, no matter the topic. Grok discussed white farmers’ deaths in reply to a video of a cat drinking water, related the song “Kill the Boer” to a question about <em>Spongebob Squarepants</em>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adashtra.bsky.social/post/3lp5pjb5r722c">broke down the issue in full patois</a>. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/667885/grok-ai-white-genocide-sam-altman">got in on the action</a>, poking fun at the rival chatbot’s public breakdown.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/xai/status/1923183620606619649">statement on X</a> the company said that someone had modified the AI bot’s system prompt, “which directed Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic.” That modification “violated xAI’s internal policies and core values,” and the company says it has “conducted a thorough investigation” and is implementing new measures to improve “transparency and reliability.”</p><p>Those measures include publishing Grok’s system level prompts <a href="https://github.com/xai-org/grok-prompts">publicly on GitHub</a>, launching a 24/7 monitoring team to catch issues like this more quickly, and adding “additional checks and measures to ensure that xAI employees can’t modify the prompt without review.”</p><p>xAI has had this problem before. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618109/grok-blocked-elon-musk-trump-misinformation">blamed an unnamed ex-OpenAI employee</a> in February for pushing a change to Grok’s prompts that saw the chatbot disregard any sources that accused Elon Musk or Donald Trump of spreading misinformation. At the time xAI’s head of engineering, Igor Babuschkin, <a href="https://x.com/ibab/status/1893778039634563094">said the employee</a> had been able to make the change “without asking anyone at the company for confirmation.”</p></div></div></div>
