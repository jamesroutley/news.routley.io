    <h1>You are not dumb, you just lack the prerequisites</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-s6cyflhg="">  <p>I always thought I was too “dumb” to understand math. During my school years, it was evident to me that for some kids math was easy, and for others like myself: <strong>painfully difficult.</strong></p>
<p>This belief shadowed me for years, a constant reminder that while believe I am smart… I’m not THAT smart.</p>
<p>Recently, after 150 days immersed in learning math, I had a stark realization.</p>
<p>The struggle wasn’t because I wasn’t capable, but rather, <strong>I was simply missing a shit-ton of pre-requisite knowledge.</strong></p>
<p>It’s like trying to defeat a Elden Ring boss… at level 1.</p>
<p>It’s like walking into a movie halfway through—you can’t understand the plot because you missed the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>The same goes for learning complex subjects like math, CS, whatever.</strong></p>
<p>The gap in comprehension wasn’t due to a lack of ability but rather a gap in prerequisite knowledge.</p>
<p>So here’s a gentle reminder: You’re not dumb—you just might not have all the prerequisites yet.</p>
<h2 id="building-from-the-ground-up">Building from the Ground Up</h2>
<p>Realizing this, I decided to rebuild my math skills from the ground up. I revisited the basics I had glossed over or misunderstood in the past.</p>
<p>Going further back in my material, picking better learning methods and practicing like hell.</p>
<p>This process was slow, often humbling, but it was necessary. Each foundational concept I mastered laid the groundwork for more complex theories and problems.</p>
<h2 id="have-i-turned-that-smart-yet">Have I turned THAT smart yet?</h2>
<p>Hell no. In fact, I’m still pretty dumb. <strong>But I’m slowly getting there.</strong></p>  </div></div>
