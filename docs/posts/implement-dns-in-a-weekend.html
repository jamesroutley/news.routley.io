<p>Hello! Our goal here is to implement a toy DNS resolver.</p>
<p>What’s a DNS resolver? It’s a program that knows how to figure out what the IP
address for a domain is. Here’s what the command line
interface of the resolver we’re going to write looks like:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ python3 resolve.py example.com
93.184.216.34
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The whole thing is about 200 lines of Python, including implementing all of the binary DNS parsing from scratch.</p>
<p>This project is a fun way to learn:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How to parse a binary network protocol like DNS</p></li>
<li><p>How DNS works under the hood (what’s happening behind the scenes when you make a DNS query?)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some bonus exercises if you want to implement a few more of the
features a real DNS resolver would have.</p>
<p>Everything is in a Jupyter notebook, which you can download and run. You can download all the code here:</p>
