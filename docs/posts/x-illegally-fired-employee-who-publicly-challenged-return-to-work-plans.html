The NLRB alleged that X fired Yue after she attempted to organize other Twitter workers who were upset about Musk&#39;s sudden change to the company&#39;s work requirements.</p><p>CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/elon-musk-sets-more-in-office-requirements-at-twitter.html">reported</a> that Musk sent emails to Twitter employees detailing his expectations, going so far as to say &#34;any manager who falsely claims that someone reporting to them is doing excellent work or that a given role is essential, whether remote or not, will be exited from the company.&#34;</p><p>&#34;If you can physically make it to an office and you don&#39;t show up, resignation accepted,&#34; Musk said, according to the NLRB. That led several workers to express &#34;concern and outrage&#34; over the directive to return to the office immediately, according to the original legal charge document that was filed in March.</p><p>Yue then tweeted, &#34;Don&#39;t resign, let him fire you. You gain literally nothing out of resignation.&#34; She also posted in a company Slack channel a message saying, &#34;Don&#39;t be fired. Seriously.&#34;</p><p>Many of Yue&#39;s colleagues responded to her messages, according to the legal charge document. Meanwhile, Musk also directed his management team to scan any online posts and Slack &#34;in order to identify who should be fired,&#34; the document said.</p><p>Five days later, Yue was fired and told that she was violating an unspecified company policy, the legal document said.</p><p>&#34;Ms. Yue alleges that Twitter chose her for layoff in retaliation for her attempt to organize her co-workers not to resign, so they would have better legal footing to challenge any separation from Twitter,&#34; the document said.</p><p>The NLRB alleges that X has &#34;been interfering with, restraining, and coercing employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed&#34; under national labor law.</p><p>A spokesperson for X didn&#39;t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>&#34;After 12 amazing years and 3 weeks of chaos, I&#39;m officially fired by Twitter,&#34; Yue said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/thinkingfish/status/1592522358581264384?lang=en" target="_blank">tweet</a> on Nov. 15. &#34;Never expected I would have stayed this long, and never expected I would be this relieved to be gone.&#34;</p><p>The NLRB said it&#39;s seeking to &#34;Make Yao Yue whole for any direct or foreseeable pecuniary harm, as well as other consequential damages suffered as a result of Respondent&#39;s unlawful conduct&#34; in addition to providing &#34;all other relief as may be just and proper to remedy the unfair labor practices alleged.&#34;</p><p>A hearing on the case is scheduled for Jan. 30, in San Francisco.</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2023/10/05/elon-musk-has-cut-off-the-good-guys-empowered-the-bad-guys-on-x-says-stanfords-alex-stamos.html">Elon Musk has &#34;cut off the good guys, empowered the bad guys&#34; on X</a></p></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107312001"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107312001" data-vilynx-id="7000317952" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107312002-16965101711696510167-31469252091-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1696510606&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Elon Musk has &#39;cut off the good guys, empowered the bad guys&#39; on X, says Stanford&#39;s Alex Stamos"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
