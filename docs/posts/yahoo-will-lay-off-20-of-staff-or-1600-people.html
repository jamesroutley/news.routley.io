				<p id="speakable-summary">Yahoo is laying off 20% of its staff, impacting 1,600 employees in its ad tech business. Yahoo is the parent company to TechCrunch.</p>
<p>Employees were notified on Thursday that 12% of the company (1,000 employees) would be laid off before the end of the day. In six months, another 8% — or 600 people — will be let go. These cuts will impact around half of Yahoo’s ad tech business.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/02/09/yahoo-layoffs-2023-tech-media-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Axios</a>, Yahoo CEO Jim Lanzone said that these layoffs are not a result of economic issues, but rather, they are intentional changes to strengthen the unprofitable Yahoo for Business advertising unit. As a whole, Yahoo is profitable, earning around <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/11/29/yahoo-eyes-stock-trading-amid-growth-push" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$8 billion</a> in yearly revenue.</p>
<p>In November, Yahoo took an almost <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/28/yahoo-gets-25-stake-in-taboola-as-part-of-long-term-advertising-deal/">25% stake</a> in advertising network Taboola, which is now the company’s native advertising partner in a 30-year commercial agreement. Lanzone told Axios that these changes will allow Yahoo to increase competition for ad placements eight times over — but as a result of this transition, Yahoo will shut down native advertising platforms like Gemini and its supply-side platform (SSP). Yahoo will also focus on its demand-side platform (DSP), which will be renamed Yahoo Advertising. This division will focus on deals with Fortune 500 companies.</p>
<p>“Over several years, the strategy of our ads business was to compete in the ad tech industry by offering a ‘unified stack’ consisting of our Demand Side Platform (DSP), Supply Side Platform (SSP) and Native platforms,” a Yahoo spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch. “Despite many years of effort and investment, this strategy was not profitable and struggled to live up to our high standards across the entire stack.”</p>
<p>In 2021, private equity firm Apollo Global Management completed its <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/01/apollo-completes-its-5b-acquisition-of-verizon-media-now-known-as-yahoo/">$5 billion acquisition of Yahoo</a>, which was formerly known as Verizon Media group.</p>
