It also comes ready for customization, also known as &#34;upfitting,&#34; to turn the vehicle into a living or sleeping space.</p><p>Ford is attempting to cash in on the boom in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/27/pandemic-pushes-travelers-to-take-on-the-road-in-rvs.html">sales of recreational trailers and vehicles</a>, or RVs, during the coronavirus pandemic. Ford already is one of the main companies that provides trucks and vans to upfitters to make them into RVs. It also has launched a slew of off-road vehicles in recent years such as the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/ford-begins-shipping-bronco-suvs-for-consumers-.html">Ford Bronco SUVs</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/ford-f-150-tremor-pickup-announced-with-new-off-road-adds.html">F-150 Tremor pickup</a>.</p><p>&#34;We will have more demand than supply, based on all the numbers we see,&#34; Ted Cannis, CEO of the automaker&#39;s Ford Pro commercial vehicle business, told CNBC.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107145002" data-test="InlineImage"><div><div><p>2023 Ford Transit Trail</p><p>Ford</p></div></div></div><div><p>Ford is touting the Transit Trail Van as a gateway into &#34;van life,&#34; a community of travelers who fully or partially live in their vehicles. Photos released Thursday by the automaker show the vehicle immersed in a scenic setting, including a couple who appear to be living by a river.</p><p>The phrase &#34;living in a van down by the river&#34; was made famous by Chris Farley during a 1993 &#34;Saturday Night Live&#34; sketch where he played Matt Foley, a divorced motivational speaker who lives in a van down by the river. He tries to use his situation to motivate two children — played by David Spade and Christina Applegate — to say no to smoking marijuana.</p><p>For a time, Ford CEO Jim Farley had a reference to the bit — and his late cousin — in his Twitter profile: &#34;Mustang and racing fan. Happen to love white vans ...  preferably down by the river.&#34; The auto executive has paid <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/what-to-know-about-fords-incoming-ceo-jim-farley.html">other tributes to his cousin</a> on the social media platform through the use of memes and other media.</p><p>Cannis said there&#39;s no connection between the vehicle and &#34;SNL&#34; sketch. However, he said Jim Farley asked about getting into this segment after a trip to California in 2020.</p><p>&#34;He&#39;s very enamored with the space, but it&#39;s really just coincidence in this case,&#34; Cannis said.</p><p>The 2023 Ford Transit Trail Van will go on sale in the spring, starting at $65,975. That&#39;s about $15,000 more than a base passenger Transit van. The vehicle will be available in three cargo van configurations, including medium- and high-roof models and a high-roof, extended-length version.</p><p>The van will be produced at Ford&#39;s Kansas City Assembly Plant in Missouri. The vehicle does not come standard with a living or sleeping space, but Transit Trail owners will have access to Ford Pro&#39;s network of upfitters and interior installers.</p><p>The vehicle will be sold to consumers as well as commercial upfitters, which Cannis says can spend tens of thousands of dollars customizing such vehicles.</p></div><div id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-107145004" data-test="InlineImage"><div><div><p>The 2023 Transit Trail comes standard with front swivel seats, according to Ford.
