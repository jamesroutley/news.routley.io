    <h1>The Lions Operating System</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><blockquote>LionsOS is currently undergoing active research and
development, it does not have a concrete verification story yet.
It is not expected for LionsOS to be stable at this time, but it
is available for others to experiment with.</blockquote><p>LionsOS is an operating system based on the <a href="https://sel4.systems">seL4 microkernel</a>
with the goal of making the achievements of seL4 accessible. That is,
to provide performance, security, and reliability.</p><p>LionsOS is being developed by the <a href="https://trustworthy.systems">Trustworthy Systems</a> research
group at <a href="https://unsw.edu.au">UNSW Sydney</a> in Australia.</p><img src="https://lionsos.org/lionsos_arch.svg" alt="Architecture of a LionsOS-based system"/><p>It is not a conventional operating system, but contains composable
components for creating custom operating systems that are specific to
a particular task. Components are joined together using the
<a href="https://github.com/seL4/microkit">Microkit</a> tool.</p><p>The principles on which a LionsOS system is built are laid out fully
in the <a href="https://trustworthy.systems/projects/drivers/sddf-design-latest.pdf">sDDF design document</a>; but in brief they
are:</p><ol><li><p>Components are connected by lock-free queues using an efficient
model-checked signalling mechanism.</p></li><li><p>As far as is practical, operating systems components do a single
thing. Drivers for instance exist solely to convert between a
hardware interface and a set of queues to talk to the rest of the
system.</p></li><li><p>Components called
<em>virtualisers</em> handle multiplexing and control, and conversion
between virtual and IO addresses for drivers.</p></li><li><p>Information is shared only where necessary, via the queues, or via
published information pages.</p></li><li><p>The system is static: it does not adapt to changing hardware, and
does not load components at runtime. There is a mechanism for
swapping components <em>of the same type</em> at runtime, to implement
policy changes, or to reboot a virtual machine with a new Linux
kernel.</p></li></ol><p>To be successful, many more components are needed. Pull requests to
the various repositories are welcome. See the
<a href="https://lionsos.org/docs/contributing">page on contributing</a> for more details.</p></article></div>
