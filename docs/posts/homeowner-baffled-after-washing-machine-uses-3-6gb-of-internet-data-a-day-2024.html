    <h1>Homeowner baffled after washing machine uses 3.6GB of internet data a day (2024)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>A tech-savvy San Francisco resident has sparked conversation online after he shared a perplexing discovery about his LG washing machine&#39;s seemingly voracious appetite for data on X (formerly <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/topic/twitter">Twitter</a>).</p><p>In a post with more than 7 million views, Johnie Lee shared a screenshot of his machine&#39;s data usage, which showed around 3.6GB of daily data usage. For context, 3GB of data is the rough equivalent of streaming high-definition video for an hour on a device.</p><p>A spokesperson for LG told <em>Newsweek</em>: &#34;LG has connected with the customer regarding the high-traffic data concern and is actively investigating to understand the root of this unusual occurrence.</p><p>&#34;Following the spike, the washer has shown reduced traffic data. Despite this being an isolated incident, LG remains committed to investigating the underlying cause.&#34;</p><div><p><img id="8338685" clicktodisplay="false" showcredit="true" credit="RossHelen/Getty Images" alt="Washing machine" caption="A picture of a washing machine with a smartphone in the foreground.

The connection to a Wi-Fi network allows the user to operate functions from a smartphone, download additional wash programs, and receive alerts when a load is complete.</p><p>But Lee, a home automation and tech enthusiast, stumbled upon the anomaly while troubleshooting issues with his home network.</p><p>&#34;I had noticed at the beginning of January that my Internet was running a little slow and my network was behaving a little weird,&#34; he told <em>Newsweek</em>. &#34;On January 8, I was looking through the router logs to see what devices were using the most bandwidth. Besides the usual suspects, I noticed that my LG Washing Machine had the fourth-highest usage of data for the week. This was highly suspicious.&#34;</p><p>In September 2023, the U.K.-based consumer awareness publication Which? reported the results of a study into the data our smart devices use and collect. Results found that smart washing machines are collecting a significant amount of user data, including personal information such as date of birth, location, and even access to photos.</p><p>There is no evidence that the data is being sold to third parties, but the prolonged lifespan of washing machines has begun to raise questions about long-term data tracking.</p><div><p><img id="8338688" clicktodisplay="false" showcredit="true" credit="@Johnie/X" alt="Washing machine" caption="A screenshot of the washing machine data that shows around 3.6GB of data use a day." sourcealt="@Johnie/X" sources="[]" fetchpriority="auto" loading="lazy" width="1500" height="1000" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2338688-washing-machine.png?w=1600&amp;quality=75&amp;webp=1 1x" src="https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2338688-washing-machine.png?w=1600&amp;quality=75&amp;webp=1"/></p></div><p>The Which? article said that LG washing machines require users to provide their date of birth to use the associated app, while Samsung and Miele request access to photos and location data. They advised users to review the privacy policies and settings of smart devices, to ensure they fully understand and can potentially limit the data being collected in their home.</p><p>Lee is keen to embrace technological advances in everyday life but was baffled by the behavior of the washing machine and shared what he had found on X, hoping to prompt a laugh or two with his followers.</p><p>&#34;When I discovered the data usage, it was such a surreal moment that I felt like sharing with my small network on X to share in the bafflement and have a collective laugh at my dirty laundry misfortunes,&#34; he said. &#34;I never expected it to blow up the way it did.&#34;</p><p>The unexpected attention prompted a wave of reactions and jokes, touching on issues including AI, bitcoin, privacy, downloadable content (DLC), and the ever-growing impact of technology on our lives.</p><p>Alongside the jokes, the discovery prompted conversation around the trade-offs between privacy and convenience as our lives become increasingly connected with data and data collection.</p></article></div>
