    <h1>A 4k-Room Text Adventure Written by One Human in QBasic No AI</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You stand upon the cusp of the unknown. The Labyrinth of Time’s Edge has erupted into a vast and untamed world of <strong>3,999 handcrafted rooms</strong>, each echoing with new horrors, mysteries, and echoes of forgotten souls. Every corridor tells a story, every shadow hides something waiting to be unearthed. The world has grown so immense that even the most seasoned adventurers will find themselves lost, humbled, and reborn in its depths. The <strong>werewolves, undead, spiders, and spectral ladies</strong> that now wander these halls mark a turning point, a reminder that no map is complete, no victory final. The rules have changed. What you thought you knew about mastery, exploration, and courage will be tested anew. This is no longer just a journey through text; it’s a descent into creation itself, a boundless realm forged in imagination, fear, and faith.</p>
