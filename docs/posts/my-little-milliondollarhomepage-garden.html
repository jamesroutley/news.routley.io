    <h1>My Little MillionDollarHomepage Garden</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Back around the time I convinced my family to switch from a 56 kb/s dial-up modem to
ADSL, the website <a href="http://milliondollarhomepage.com/">milliondollarhomepage.com</a> was
launched, and quickly became an Internet phenomenon, selling pixels for advertising
space on a 1000x1000 canvas. 18 years later, the homepage is still standing, proudly
displaying the Internet billboard of 2005, frozen in time.</p>

<p>Some time ago I bought one of the expired domain names the page points to,
<code>pixels4all.com</code>. In this post I&#39;m exploring this Internet garden.</p>

<h2 id="pixels-for-all">Pixels for all!</h2>

<p>The logo of <code>pixels4all.com</code> is not easy to find. Here&#39;s the full image in all its
glory:</p>

<p>Zooming in a bit:</p>

<p>And more:</p>

<p><img alt="Million Dollar Homepage Zoom 2" src="https://matthieu.io/include/img/pixels4all/mdh-zoom2.png"/></p>

<hr/>

<p>Here it is, our beautiful yellow and red logo:</p>

<p><img alt="Pixels4all logo" src="https://matthieu.io/include/img/pixels4all/pixels4all.png"/></p>

<p>It occupies a real estate of 200 square pixels on the page, or 0.02%, and hence cost
$200 to buy in 2005. I didn&#39;t buy those pixels myself, but I inherited the ad space when
registering the expired domain name years later. It&#39;s not exactly prominent on the page,
but it is what it is.</p>

<h2 id="ten-dollar-copycat">Ten dollar copycat</h2>

<p>A bit about the previous owners.</p>

<p>The OG <code>pixels4all.com</code> appears to be one of the many MillionDollarHomepage copycats,
surfing on the buzz and offering the same concept or similar. The Internet Archive
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050501000000*/http://www.pixels4all.com">gives a few hints</a>
about what used to be there. It was first captured on 2005/12/15, and last on
2006/04/02.</p>

<p><img alt="Pixels4all banner" src="https://matthieu.io/include/img/pixels4all/banner.png"/></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the banner is pretty much all there is to see. Most pictures are missing,
the <code>Buy Pixels</code> link redirects to a login page, and <code>FAQs</code> is not a link. My best bet
is that pixels could be bought for a limited time of 30 days.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also written that 4800 pixels have been sold. This number is consistent across the
few months the website was alive, and gives an estimate of the total revenue: $9.6.</p>

<p>From there, starting at the latest in June 2006, the domain is for sale and displays a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060610134308/http://pixels4all.com/">Sedo.com parking page</a>,
listing it for $500. Later replaced by
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071011171008/http://pixels4all.com/">a GoDaddy parking page</a>,
a new
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140330040834/http://www.pixels4all.com/">Sedo parking page</a>,
an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160118010531/http://www.pixels4all.com/">empty page</a>,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160110091917/http://pixels4all.com/">503</a>,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170912055117/http://pixels4all.com/">404</a>, and finally in
2017 a redirection to <code>?reqp=1&amp;reqr=</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, an URL which hasn&#39;t been archived.</p>

<p>I bought the domain in 2019, and didn&#39;t do much with it until 2022, when I set up a
dummy page behind a server. I was curious to see if there was any traffic, but more on
that later.</p>

<h2 id="my-lovely-neighbours">My lovely neighbours</h2>

<p>So we got a few months of unsuccessful time-based pixel selling in 2006. But enough with
failed businesses, let&#39;s look at how my neighbours are doing.</p>

<p>Thanks to this
<a href="https://binarymoon.github.io/MillionDollarHomepage/">MillionDollarHomepage restoration</a>,
we can browse the websites directly through the Internet Archive<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. My immediate
neighbours are pretty cool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051013054846/http://www.club-millionaire.com/index.php">Club-Millionaire.com</a>.
Pronounced CLUB MILLIONAIRE, and self-described as &#34;for those who believes in endless
opportunities of the Universe of the Internet on the Planet of the Earth&#34;. It&#39;s a kind
of Ponzi scheme but also with pixels for the members? Seems legit, but unfortunately
it doesn&#39;t exist anymore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060617040443/http://www.fairchild.co.uk/default.asp?cookies=no">FairChild.co.uk</a>.
With an interesting redirection mechanism (<code>default.asp</code> -&gt; <code>cookie.asp</code> -&gt;
<code>default.ask?cookies=no</code>), they are &#34;<em>Manufacturers of Industrial Computers And
Webservers Since 1989</em>&#34;. Nowadays, it times out with a Cloudflare page.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050803031129/http://www.etcompany.com/">ETCompany.com</a>.
Selling refurbished notebooks, printers and more hardware from the good old days.
&#34;<em>Offering WHOLESALE PRICES to the PUBLIC since 1993!!!</em>&#34;, but unfortunately in 2023
the domain is for sale, listed at $3695.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050709005703/http://www.laptopblowout.com/">LaptopBlowout.com</a>.
Very similar to the previous one, but with solid deals: &#34;<em>Please, don&#39;t spend your
efforts and time looking for better prices on laptops. Our prices are the Best on the
WEB</em>&#34;. Today the page looks empty but triggers ad-blockers and CORS warnings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060114044200/http://www.awebapart.com/">AWebApart.com</a>.
A landing page for a future website builder. They were all the rage back then! Neat,
it <a href="https://www.awebapart.com/">still exists</a>. It&#39;s my only surviving direct
neighbour, and I certainly enjoy its company.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Wandering a few hundreds of pixels away, some more distant but notable neighbours are a
trip down nostalgia lane. Check out

(nothing less than designer accessories and jewellery for dogs).</p>

<h2 id="bot-traffic">Bot traffic</h2>

<p>The web changed since 2005, and it&#39;s now populated by bots.</p>

<p>I setup a basic <code>index.html</code> behind a web server answering to <code>pixels4all.com</code>, and
collected a year of http logs. There were 86847 http requests made between 2022-08-08
and 2023-08-08, which is small traffic for modern standards, but nonetheless fun to dive
into - I got curious to find out who&#39;s hitting this long dead pixel-selling website.
Unsurprisingly, a fair share of bots and scrapers.</p>

<h3 id="visits-per-day">Visits per day</h3>

<p><img alt="Daily traffic" src="https://matthieu.io/include/img/pixels4all/visits-per-day.png"/></p>

<p>The 23rd of March stands out. 90% of traffic came from the same IP address, located in
Singapore and belonging to the cloud provider Digital Ocean. Interestingly enough, while
that address has tried various well-known URL paths for vulnerabilities before and after
that day, the 3274 requests made the 23rd of March were all for <code>/</code>.</p>

<p>To gather more random stats, I included an image of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Astley">web legend</a> in the <code>index.html</code> served by
<code>pixels4all.com</code>. The URL for that image can be found in the HTML source code.
<code>/rick.jpg</code> was hitâ€¦ 97 times! Parsing HTML and downloading images is rather costly - so
bots scanning for vulnerabilities don&#39;t bother with that (but why whould they).</p>

<h3 id="where-do-they-come-from">Where do they come from?</h3>

<p><img alt="World map of requests per country" src="https://matthieu.io/include/img/pixels4all/geoip-world-map.png"/></p>

<p>Mapping incoming IP addresses to their associated country<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> gives a rough idea of
where they geographically come from. #1 on the chart is the USA with 42k queries, #2 is
China with 12k queries, and #3 Germany with 9k queries. There are 71 different countries
with at least 1 hit.</p>

<p>Of course, this doesn&#39;t say much: web crawling software runs in datacenters and probably
behind VPNs, not necessarily close to the actual users.</p>

<p>To figure out how someone reached a web page, it can be interesting to look at the
<code>Referer</code> http header, which gives information about the previous page that was visited.
However, web browsers will generally not set this header for cross-domain visits (for
privacy concerns), and crawlers don&#39;t have a reason to set it either.</p>

<p>However, ~12% of the requests do have a <code>Referer</code> set. Most of them seem to be
handcrafted as they are missing <code>http[s]</code>: <code>www.google.com</code> or <code>yahoo.com</code> (haha).
Others are parseable URLs on the domain <code>pixels4all.com</code>, but they clearly don&#39;t exist,
for example <code>http://www.pixels4all.com/utility/convert/data/co</code>. I have no idea how it
ended up there. Finally, there are vulnerability exploits in the form of code injections
in SQL<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> or PHP<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>All in all, not much info about where visitors come from. I certainly hope by following
the link from the Million Dollar Homepage!</p>

<h3 id="where-do-they-go">Where do they go?</h3>

<p><img alt="URL paths" src="https://matthieu.io/include/img/pixels4all/url-paths.png"/></p>

<p>Looking at URL paths, the vast majority of requests are for <code>/</code>. And the rest, well,
clearly comes from lists of vulnerable URLs to probe for, such as files which could
contain credentials or misconfigured WordPress administration pages.</p>

<p>Naturally, they all return 404 for my placeholder website. I wonder how fun it&#39;d be to
build a honeypot there by returning fake pages?</p>

<h3 id="mozlila-firefox">Mozlila Firefox</h3>

<p>The last bit of useless information can be found in the <code>User-Agent</code> http header. A user
agent is a string identifying the software making the http request, for example
<code>Internet Explorer</code> or <code>curl</code>.</p>

<p>However, back in the day, web servers were serving different content to different
browsers, due to some features (for example <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>) not being available everywhere,
and they were interpreting the user agent string for that purpose. Browsers didn&#39;t want
to be left behind after implementing such features, so they all started to identify as a
variation of <code>Mozilla</code>. For compatibility reasons, pretty much every browser nowadays
identifies itself as <code>Mozilla/5.0 something something</code>.</p>

<p>So do web crawlers and bots, which are spoofing well-known user agents (for example
Google Chrome&#39;s) to fly under the radar.</p>

<p>That being said, almost 12k requests came with this user agent:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Mozlila/5.0 (Linux; Android 7.0; SM-G892A Bulid/NRD90M; wv) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Chrome/60.0.3112.107 Moblie Safari/537.36
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice the typos? <code>Mozlila</code>, <code>Bulid</code>, <code>Moblie</code>. Bots using this are not exactly subtle,
as <code>Mozlila</code> is a
<a href="https://trunc.org/learning/the-mozlila-user-agent-bot">well known typo in rootkits</a>,
which seems to have been copy-pasted in many tools, such as
<a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2022/10/what-does-the-fox-hack-breaking-down-the-anonymous-fox-f-automatical-script/">those developed by Anonymous Fox</a>.
Interestingly enough, some tools have fixed the typo in <code>Moblie</code> but not in <code>Mozlila</code>.</p>

<h2 id="million-dollar-garden">Million dollar garden</h2>

<p>It&#39;s been fun to dive into the history of a website pretty much nobody ever knew, and
look at the traffic logs despite its dormant state for close to 18 years.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know at this point what I&#39;ll do with the domain name - in the meantime it&#39;s a
nice Internet garden to take care of.</p>
