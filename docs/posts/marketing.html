<p>I know about WeWork for probably 10 years now. Since then times when I lived in San Francisco.</p>
<p>But somehow it never appealed to me. As far as I remember their marketing was always focused on “community” and exclusivity. They even renamed company to be “We”(about people and community) from “WeWork” (about the place to work).</p>
<p>And on top of that marketing message there was always this drama with investors and CEO.</p>
<p>All public image and message from the company was  so strange that I’ve never even checked it.</p>
<p>And then one day in 2023 when I was in New York I needed temporary office with display that I can rent for a day to setup new Mac Studio.</p>
<p>I found WeWork and loved it. Immediately I started using it a lot.</p>
<p>I travel a lot and I found WeWork perfect for that. 15 years ago when I was younger and my income was very low every time I arrived in a new city I would go to McDonald’s. Eg I would arrive in some city via bus at 7am and my checking would be at 15:00. I would just spend time in McDonald’s because they were available everywhere, they were open early, they had place to sit, they had coffee and food and bathrooms. And it was always warm.</p>
<p>10 years ago I switched  McDonald’s for Starbucks. It was even better.</p>
<p>Since 2023 I’m using WeWork and I still cannot believe how good the deal is. I’ve used it New York, London, Miami, Dublin, Warsaw, Lisbon, Munich, Cologne and Mexico City.</p>
<p>It simplified my life a lot. Because now if I arrive to London at 7am I can head straight to WeWork. They have comfortable places to work, they have hot coffee and they have security. I can leave my bags there if I want to go outside and get some food.</p>
<p>I’m still so confused why their marketing never communicated those features of WeWork.</p>
<p>WeWork is basically ubiquitous in large cities. It’s very reliable, Internet is great, booking and entering is so simple. I can go from one city to another and never notice a difference. It’s always there and always works. It solves the real problem I have instead of some abstract thing like enabling “community.”</p>
<h3>Reflections:</h3>
<ul>
<li>stop selling “community”, make and sell utilities or tools.</li>
<li>focus on your narrow and unique proposition and not abstract thing.</li>
</ul>
