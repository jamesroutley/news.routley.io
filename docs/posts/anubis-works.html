        <small>A &#39;domino effect&#39; meme starting with &#39;Amazon takes out my Git server&#39; and ending with &#39;Software deployed by the United Nations&#39;. - Meme generated on imgflip.com</small>
    

    <p>That meme is not an understatement, <a href="https://anubis.techaro.lol">Anubis</a> has been deployed by the United Nations.</p>
<p>For your amusement, here is how the inner monologue of me finding out about this went:</p>
<div><div><p><img alt="Aoi is wut" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut"/></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>What. You can&#39;t be serious, can you?</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"/></p></div><div><p><img alt="Aoi is wut" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/wut"/></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>No, that can&#39;t be a real domain of the United Nations, can it?</p></div></div><div><p><img alt="Cadey is coffee" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/cadey/coffee"/></p></div><div><p><img alt="Aoi is sus" loading="lazy" src="https://stickers.xeiaso.net/sticker/aoi/sus"/></p><div><p><span><a href="https://xeiaso.net/characters#aoi">Aoi</a></span><span></span></p><p>No way. No fucking way. What the heck, how is this real. What is YOUR
LIFE??? God I got the worst 2025 bingo card this year.</p></div></div></div>
<p>I hate to shake my can and ask for donations, but if you are using Anubis and it helps, please <a href="https://patreon.com/cadey">donate on Patreon</a>. I would really love to not have to work in generative AI anymore because the doublethink is starting to wear at my soul.</p>
<p>Also, do I happen to know anyone at UNESCO? I would love to get in touch with their systems administrator team and see if they had any trouble with setting it up. I&#39;m very interested in making it easier to install.</p>
<p>This makes the big deployments that I know about include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Linux Kernel Mailing List archives</li>
<li>FreeBSD&#39;s SVN (and soon git)</li>
<li>SourceHut</li>
<li>FFmpeg</li>
<li>Wine</li>
<li>UNESCO</li>
<li>The Science Olympiad Student Center</li>
<li>Enlightenment (the desktop environment)</li>
</ul>
<p>The conversation I&#39;m about to have with my accountant is going to be one of the most surreal conversations of all time.</p>
<p>The part that&#39;s the most wild to me is when I stop and consider the scale of these organizations. I think that this means that the problem is <em>much worse</em> than I had previously anticipated. I know that at some point YouTube was about to hit &#34;the inversion&#34; where they get more bot traffic than they get human traffic. I wonder how much this is true across most of, if not all of the Internet right now.</p>
<p>I guess this means that I really need to start putting serious amounts of effort into Anubis and the stack around it. The best way that can be ensured is if I can get enough money to survive so I can put my full time effort into it. I may end up hiring people.</p>
<p>This is my life now. Follow me <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xeiaso.net">on Bluesky</a> if you want to know when the domino meme gets more ridiculous!</p>
