					<p><em>Drop the race and gender material from your course and the Plato readings, or teach a different course. You have a day to decide.</em></p>

<p>That’s a paraphrase of what <a href="https://www.martinpeterson.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Martin Peterson</a>, professor of philosophy at Texas A&amp;M University, was told by university officials today  about his upcoming “Contemporary Moral Problems” course, due to start next week.</p>
<p>Here’s the actual email:</p>

<p>“Rule 08.01” refers to <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/11/14/a-mess-at-texas-am/">these recent policy changes</a> at the university. “Kristi” is Department of Philosophy chair <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/philosophy/contact/profiles/kristi-sweet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kristi Sweet</a>, who, I think it’s safe to assume, was merely passing along the verdict of “the <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/contact/leadership-team.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">college leadership team</a>“, headed up by interim dean <a href="https://artsci.tamu.edu/chemistry/contact/profiles/north-simon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Simon North</a>.</p>
<p>(The above email and other documents in this post were provided by Professor Peterson.)</p>
<p>I’m going to pause here just to review:<em><strong> an institution that purports to be a university has told a philosophy professor he is forbidden from teaching Plato. </strong></em></p>
<p>The Plato readings were from the <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1600/1600-h/1600-h.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Symposium</em></a>, particularly passages on Aristophanes’ myth of split humans and Diotima’s ladder of love. The other readings are from <a href="https://faculty.cengage.com/works/9780357798539?_gl=1*m74ubl*_ga*MTg1ODQ3MTk3My4xNzY3NzUyMDU0*_fplc*TjVESzFDNXlxSUl5YjhoZm9uQ3lOb1huU0F1NHE3cTJkU1AlMkJrVWVSam1sQlpqT3hhSVdKJTJCSDhPbld3TjVmS3YlMkJOQmt5SSUyQk9lV1V3Rkw0TlUxOUhsOHZZRU5LZ3RVQ0gyT2Y5ME1NY3ExZlBLb2pENUJEMWh1WUNuY2dkVFElM0QlM0Q.*_gcl_au*MTE3Njg3NTk5MS4xNzY3NzUyMDU0*_ga_1Z1VMVSHXM*czE3Njc3NTIwNTQkbzEkZzEkdDE3Njc3NTIwNTQkajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Ethics: Theory and Contemporary Issues</em></a> (10th edition) by Andrew Fiala and Barbara MacKinnon.</p>
<p>Professor Peterson had been contacted by his chair on December 19th about the review of syllabi for Contemporary Moral Problems courses. Here’s that email:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/peterson-martin-email-syllabus-review-texas.png" alt="" width="1046" height="932" srcset="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/peterson-martin-email-syllabus-review-texas.png 1217w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/peterson-martin-email-syllabus-review-texas-300x267.png 300w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/peterson-martin-email-syllabus-review-texas-1024x912.png 1024w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/peterson-martin-email-syllabus-review-texas-768x684.png 768w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/peterson-martin-email-syllabus-review-texas-400x356.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1046px) 100vw, 1046px"/></p>
<p>Professor Peterson replied to this, submitting his syllabus for what he referred to, correctly, as “mandatory censorship review”.</p>
<p>Among other things, he said, “Please note that my course does not “advocate” any ideology; I teach students how to structure and evaluate arguments commonly raised in discussions of contemporary moral issues.” (See “<a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/11/26/the-charade-of-banning-advocacy/">The Charade of Banning ‘Advocacy’</a>“.) He also reminded his chair and college officials that “the U.S. Constitution protects my course content,” as do the norms of academic freedom.</p>
<p>Here is his full reply:</p>

<p>Here is Professor Peterson’s syllabus (also <a href="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/peterson-martin-syllabus-phil-111-s-2026-texas.pdf">here</a>):</p>

<p>It was clear that Texas A&amp;M’s <a href="https://dailynous.com/2025/11/14/a-mess-at-texas-am/">new policies</a> were going to lead to conflicts with the First Amendment and academic freedom. That the first such conflict involves telling a professor to remove from his syllabus the writings of the person who created what was arguably the west’s first institution of higher education is too perfect an irony, though. This reality is unbelievable.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1 </strong>(1/7/26): Both the <a href="https://aaup-texas.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Texas A&amp;M Chapter of the American Association of University Professors</a> (AAUP) and the <a href="https://www.thefire.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression</a> (FIRE) have issued statements about Texas A&amp;M’s decision regarding Dr. Peterson’s syllabus.</p>
<p>The Texas A&amp;M AAUP <a href="https://aaup-texas.org/blog/f/aaup-texas-am-university-condemns-banning-of-plato" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a>:</p>
<p><em>The AAUP–Texas A&amp;M-College Station Chapter condemns Texas A&amp;M University’s reported decision to censor the teaching of Plato by restricting a professor from covering foundational philosophical texts within his expertise in an undergraduate core course because it addresses race and gender theories. At a public university, this action raises serious legal concerns, including viewpoint discrimination and violations of constitutionally protected academic freedom.</em></p>
<p><em>Beyond the legal implications, the moral stakes are profound. Silencing 2,500-year-old ideas from one of the world’s most influential thinkers betrays the mission of higher education and denies students the opportunity to engage critically with the foundations of Western thought. A research university that censors Plato abandons its obligation to truth, inquiry, and the public trust—and should not be regarded as a serious institution of higher learning. We are deeply saddened to witness the decline of one of Texas’s great universities.</em></p>
<p>FIRE’s Lindsie Rank <a href="https://www.thefire.org/news/texas-am-philosophy-professor-nix-plato-or-be-reassigned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a>:</p>
<p><em>Texas A&amp;M now believes Plato doesn’t belong in an introductory philosophy course. The philosophy department is demanding that professor Martin Peterson remove Platonic readings because they “may” touch on race or gender ideology. He’s been given until the end of the day to comply or be reassigned. This is what happens when the board of regents gives university bureaucrats veto power over academic content. The board didn’t just invite censorship, they unleashed it with immediate and predictable consequences. You don’t protect students by banning 2,400-year-old philosophy.</em></p>
