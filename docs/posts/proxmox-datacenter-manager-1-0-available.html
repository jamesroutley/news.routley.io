<p><strong>VIENNA, Austria – December 04, 2025</strong> –Enterprise software developer Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH (henceforth “Proxmox”) today announced the immediate availability of the stable version 1.0 of Proxmox Datacenter Manager. This new product directly addresses the increasing complexity of operating distributed and large-scaled Proxmox-based environments. Proxmox Datacenter Manager offers a holistic single pane of glass view for the administration, monitoring, and scaling of Proxmox VE and Proxmox Backup Server, with the primary goal of providing administrators with comprehensive and seamless control.</p>
<p>Managing growing data centers, distributed across multiple locations or clusters, consistently presents major challenges for enterprises and teams. A lack of global oversight, fragmented metrics, and the need to perform complex operations manually across various environments can quickly lead to inefficiencies and increased error susceptibility.</p>
<p>Proxmox Datacenter Manager was developed as the strategic answer to this scaling challenge. It bridges the gap between individual Proxmox-based nodes and clusters, providing a unified view of the entire infrastructure. This not only simplifies routine tasks but also enables advanced functionalities that were previously difficult to achieve.</p>
</article>
<h2>Highlights of Proxmox Datacenter Manager 1.0</h2>
<p>Proxmox Datacenter Manager delivers a set of core functions specifically designed for managing complex, enterprise-grade environments:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Centralized overview and metrics aggregation:</strong> Users can connect multiple Proxmox “remotes” (nodes and clusters) and gain a real-time, consolidated overview from a single dashboard. The consolidated dashboard displays the global health status of all Proxmox VE clusters and Proxmox Backup Server instances. It aggregates critical resource usage, including CPU, RAM, and storage I/O, and provides an immediate view of critical key performance indicators (KPIs) and performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and potential issues early on. Data is cached locally, maintaining offline visibility of the last known state.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic, role-based custom views:</strong> With customizable dashboards, IT teams can create highly filtered, targeted overviews based on specific remotes, resource types, or operational tags. Crucially, the Proxmox Datacenter Manager leverages its native role-based access control (RBAC) to grant users access to these tailored views without providing direct access to the underlying virtual machines or hosts. This functionality ensures granular permission management and delivers need-to-know transparency across diverse teams and multi-tenant environments.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-cluster management:</strong> Seamlessly connect to and manage independent Proxmox-based clusters and standalone nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-cluster live migration:</strong> One of the most prominent features is the capability for the live migration of VMs between different clusters. This empowers administrators to perform responsive load shifts and maintenance work without downtime.</li>
<li><strong>Basic VM &amp; container life-cycle management for virtual infrastructure:</strong> Routine administrative tasks such as starting, stopping, or configuring VMs, containers, and storage resources can be executed directly from the central interface. Further, with the included native Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Proxmox Datacenter Manager allows to precisely manage user permissions and centralize task histories and logs to simplify auditing and meeting compliance requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Powerful search functionality:</strong> Version 1.0 comes with a highly intuitive and powerful search functionality. Inspired by query languages like those used in Elasticsearch and GitHub, administrators can instantly filter and locate resources. Data can be filtered by resource type (remote, VM, container), status (stopped, running, etc.) or by custom tags, therefore ensuring that even in infrastructures managing thousands of virtual guests, critical resources and diagnostic data are found with unprecedented speed and precision.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized SDN capabilities (EVPN):</strong> The platform features support for Software-Defined Networking (SDN), enabling the configuration of EVPN zones and VNets across multiple remotes from a single interface, simplifying complex network overlays and network administration in highly scaled environments.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized update management:</strong> Proxmox Datacenter Manager introduces a central Update Management Panel that gives administrators an instant overview of all available updates across their entire Proxmox VE and Proxmox Backup Server infrastructure. Updates can be rolled out directly from the Datacenter Manager interface, simplifying patch management and strengthening the overall security posture. In addition, Datacenter Manager provides unified, secure shell access to all managed remotes from a single console.</li>
<li><strong>Open-source software stack:</strong> Proxmox Datacenter Manager is based on Debian 13.2 “Trixie”, uses a newer Linux kernel version 6.17 as stable default, and includes ZFS 2.3. Furthermore, its core software stack is written in the high-performance Rust programming language, with a responsive user interface built upon the new Rust/Yew Proxmox UI framework, delivering enhanced speed and an optimal user experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#34;The modern infrastructure landscape demands adaptability, from data centers to edge locations. Organizations need tools that evolve alongside their business. Proxmox Datacenter Manager is designed as a key building block within our expanding ecosystem, empowering customers with the right solution for every stage of their journey&#34;, says Tim Marx, COO at Proxmox. &#34;By choosing the Proxmox ecosystem, organizations unlock a wide range of deployment options. From high-performance setups at hyperscalers to distributed branch offices that maintain data sovereignty. Our consistent commitment to openness ensures long-term interoperability and real freedom of choice for customers and partners.&#34;</p>
