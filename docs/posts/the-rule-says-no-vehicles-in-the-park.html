  This is a game about language and rules.  It consists of 27 questions, but
  after the first seven, you can skip to the end.
</p>

<p>
At the end, I&#39;ll tell you how your results compared to those of others,
and discuss why I made this game.

Have you played this game before? </form>
</div><div id="prelude">

<p>Every question is about a hypothetical park.  The park has a rule: &#34;No
vehicles in the park.&#34;  Your job is to determine if this rule has been
violated.</p>

<p>
You might know of some rule in your jurisdiction which overrides local
rules, and allows certain classes of vehicles. Please disregard these
rules; the park isn&#39;t necessarily in your jurisdiction.  Or perhaps
your religion allows certain rules to be overridden.  Again, please
answer the question of whether the rule is violated (not whether
the violation should be allowed).
