    <h1>Meta might be secretly scanning your phone&#39;s camera roll</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="infoCardDek"><div><h3>   Why is Facebook cloud-processing my device&#39;s camera roll?   </h3><p>Meta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven&#39;t posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.   </p><h3>   Where is this feature being tested?   </h3><p>Meta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, &#34;We&#39;re exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person&#39;s camera roll.&#34;   </p><p>The test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it&#39;s not available in <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/ai-terms" rel="noopener nofollow sponsored" target="_blank"><span>Illinois or Texas</span><!----></a></span> due to those states&#39; privacy laws.   </p><h3>   Did Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?   </h3><p>Meta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven&#39;t seen it. Instead, they found the toggles in their settings already switched on by default, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.   </p><figure><div><div><picture><!----> <img src="" alt="Is Meta scanning your camera roll?

The only way to confirm is by <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-protect-your-privacy-from-facebook-and-what-doesnt-work/">downloading your Facebook account data.</a></p><h3>   Why is this a potential privacy issue?   </h3><p>It expands Meta&#39;s reach beyond the content you&#39;ve chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that&#39;s a major red flag and a line they&#39;re not comfortable crossing, understandably so.   </p><p><strong>Also:Â </strong><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/metas-personal-superintelligence-dream-leaves-much-to-the-imagination/"><strong>What Zuckerberg&#39;s &#39;personal superintelligence&#39; sales pitch leaves out</strong></a></p><p>Even if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone&#39;s photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it&#39;s trying to do.   </p><p>How many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they&#39;d just agreed to?   </p><p><em>Editor&#39;s note: This article was updated on Aug. 24, 2025 to clarify that Meta&#39;s camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings</em>.</p></div></div></div>
