    <h1>Nvidia Is Simulating a Copy of the Earth</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="incArticle"><h2>Welcome to Earth-2.</h2><h2>Digital Twin</h2><p>Chipmaker Nvidia has shown off a clone of our entire planet that could help meteorologists simulate and visualize global weather patterns at an &#34;unprecedented scale,&#34; according to a <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-earth-climate-digital-twin">press release</a>.</p><p>The &#34;Earth climate digital twin,&#34; dubbed Earth-2, was designed to help recoup some of the economic losses caused by climate change-driven extreme weather.</p><p>Customers can access the digital twin through an API, allowing &#34;virtually any user to create AI-powered emulations to speed delivery of interactive, high-resolution simulations ranging from the global atmosphere and local cloud cover to typhoons and turbulence.&#34;</p><p>The company is hoping to help improve early warning systems for natural disasters and improve weather forecasts — and in a matter of seconds, not &#34;minutes or hours in traditional CPU-driven modeling.&#34;</p><p>Nvidia claims the new platform is both 1,000 faster at generating predictive images than current models and 3,000 times more energy efficient thanks to a — you guessed it — generative AI model called CorrDiff.</p><p>&#34;Climate disasters are now normal — historic droughts, catastrophic hurricanes and generational floods appear in the news with alarming frequency,&#34; said Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang in a statement. &#34;Earth-2 cloud APIs strive to help us better prepare for — and inspire us to act to moderate — extreme weather.&#34;</p><h2>Earth-2</h2><p>Government officials are already planning to make use of Earth-2 to improve their extreme weather modeling. For instance, the Central Weather Administration of Taiwan wants to use the platform to forecast the precise locations of where typhoons will make landfall.</p><p>The Weather Company has also committed to using the tool to visualize the impact of weather conditions.</p><p>The platform is the latest sign of Nvidia&#39;s ascendancy. Especially with the advent of generative AI tools, the tech world has <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/zuckerberg-bored-metaverse-ai-chips">become ravenous</a> for Nvidia&#39;s graphics cards or GPUs, which not only power those models, but platforms like Earth-2 as well.</p><p>By turning its attention to climate change and the disastrous consequences of extreme weather, Nvidia is weaponizing its AI tech for a fight that&#39;s only bound to grow in the near future. The only question? Whether it&#39;ll be accurate in the long term.</p><p><strong>More on Nvidia:</strong> <em><a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/nvidia-ai-nurses">Nvidia Announces AI-Powered &#34;Agents&#34; to Replace Nurses in Hospitals</a></em></p></div></div>
