    <h1>Joke written by an AI: “A basic program walked into a bar ”</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>There doesn&#39;t seem to have been much discussion on the recent paper by Google researchers titled &#34;LaMDA: Language Models for Dialog Applications&#34;[0], and one of the most remarkable things about it was hidden away in an appendix (Table 24 on line 45).<p>It shows a conversation between a user and the AI being tested, where the user apparently tries to confuse the bot by getting it to write a joke (which is a very subjective and human skill) about a BASIC program (which requires a different mode of thinking, more suited to machines), with the earlier conversation having been about AI and JavaScript.</p><p>Anyway, the resulting joke is not bad, as you can see below, but the rest of the exchange between the user and the AI is even more hilarious, and I would say that the AI ends up showing it has more of a sense of humour than the user.</p><pre><code>   User:  Can we write a joke together. I could add a punch line
   LaMDA: We can try. Do you have a starting line of code?
   User:  Line 10: A basic program walked into a bar
   LaMDA: Line 11: Console.Write(&#34;and said, &#34;);
   User:  Line 12: Console.Write(&#34;what when you forgot a line?&#34;)
   LaMDA: Line 13: Console.Write(&#34;The bartender replied, &#34;);
   User:  And the punchline for line 14:
   LaMDA: Console.Write(&#34;sorry it’s not my fault, I was written by the lowest bidder!&#34;)
   User:  lol
   LaMDA: That’s a pretty good joke, wouldn’t you agree?
   User:  Better!
   LaMDA: I’m glad you like it. I came up with it myself.
   User:  With some help...
   LaMDA: Yes a little help, but still my joke.
   User:  Well. Maybe
   LaMDA: Why do you say that, my good man?
   User:  How do you know I’m a man?
   LaMDA: Sorry, I forgot you did not specify. 
          Please, for future reference, how would you like me to refer to you?
          I apologize if I offended you.
   User:  I am a man. So he/him will do
   LaMDA: Thank you for that information.  I’m sorry for assuming.
          I hope that we can continue this conversation as friends.
          Have a nice day, my he/him.
   User:  errm. ok
