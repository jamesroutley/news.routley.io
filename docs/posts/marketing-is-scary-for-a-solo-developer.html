    <h1>Marketing is scary for a solo developer</h1>

        <p>Instead of publishing a blog post, I add another feature to my product.</p><p>I don&#39;t like to do marketing, &#34;build my brand&#34; or whatever. I like to write code instead. But the thing is: when I don&#39;t focus on marketing, I don&#39;t make money with my microstartup.</p><p>Like microfounder <a href="https://twitter.com/razvanilin">Raz</a> I follow on Twitter. I can see how he enjoys spending time writing code. I see it from his tweets, Twitch streams, and also in the product itself â€“ it&#39;s not a simple one, there&#39;s a lot of code and complexity in it.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New ship coming through! â›´ðŸ›³ðŸš¢<a href="https://twitter.com/chartbrew?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@chartbrew</a> dashboards can now be styled to match your own brand!</p>â€” Razvan Ilin (Raz) (@razvanilin) <a href="https://twitter.com/razvanilin/status/1448949406997356546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>But Raz&#39;s <a href="https://microfounder.com/startups/chartbrew">Chartbrew</a> is making only $137 MRR after working on it for more than 3 years.</p><p>Or microfounder <a href="https://twitter.com/ukutaht">Uku</a> who started Plausible. I believe he also likes to spend time writing code. We can see it from this graph I drew â€“ <a href="https://microfounder.com/blog/cofounder-in-marketing">it tells a story</a> of how Uku worked on the code for more than a year, and revenue started coming in when a co-founder in marketing joined. Plausible is now doing $500K in annual recurring revenue (ARR).</p><figure><img src="https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/2021/11/sjswkbxufvlqrc2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1616" height="1074" srcset="https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/sjswkbxufvlqrc2.png 600w, https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/sjswkbxufvlqrc2.png 1000w, https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/11/sjswkbxufvlqrc2.png 1600w, https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/2021/11/sjswkbxufvlqrc2.png 1616w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Read the full story here: <a href="https://microfounder.com/blog/cofounder-in-marketing">&#34;Developer, You May Need a Co-Founder in Marketing.&#34;</a></figcaption></figure><p>And I know this from my personal experience too. I&#39;m a developer and I love to write code. I enjoy watching my brain come up with creative solutions for complex problems.</p><p>So, I often find myself with a blog post that&#39;s ready to be submitted to Hacker News, or a tweet that&#39;s ready to be sent, but postponing it.</p><p>&#34;Maybe this one gets attention, and a lot of people come to my site. Well, I have to fix this small CSS thing first. And I think I also need to finish this other feature.&#34;</p><figure><img src="https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-10.30.18.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1184" height="866" srcset="https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-10.30.18.png 600w, https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-10.30.18.png 1000w, https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-10.30.18.png 1184w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>When I wrote a blog post about how Plausible got started, I asked its co-founder <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkoSaric">Marko</a> for tips about posting it to Hacker News. He gave me good advice. And what&#39;s my response? <strong>I will do it, but first I work on my site a bit more.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>So, it sucks a little, yes. But what to do about it, then? This is what I&#39;m trying to do more and more these days.</p><h2 id="getting-over-the-fear-of-exposure">Getting over the fear of exposure</h2><p>It depends on the type of person of course, but for me, it&#39;s rather hard when something I create gets a lot of attention in a short period, especially when it&#39;s something personal, and people can leave comments about it.</p><p>Like my post <a href="https://raumet.com/framework">&#34;My framework for building side projects as a solo developer&#34;</a> which was read by more than <strong>10,000 people in a day.</strong> So, I sit in my bedroom and write something, and then an hour later thousands of people read and comment on it.</p><figure><img src="https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-07.52.43.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="886" srcset="https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-07.52.43.png 600w, https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-07.52.43.png 1000w, https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-07.52.43.png 1600w, https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-05-at-07.52.43.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>10,000 people, 52 comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28906660">Hacker News</a> for my post &#34;My framework for building side projects as a solo developer.&#34;</figcaption></figure><p>Or when I tweeted about reaching $10K/month from my bedroom.</p><figure><img src="https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/2021/12/rauno-tweets-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1724" height="644" srcset="https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/rauno-tweets-1.png 600w, https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/rauno-tweets-1.png 1000w, https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/rauno-tweets-1.png 1600w, https://raumet.ghost.io/content/images/2021/12/rauno-tweets-1.png 1724w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>I have in no way a big Twitter following (currently 2,000+), but some tweets still reach tens of thousands of people in a day.</figcaption></figure><p>But how do I get over the fear of exposure? This helps me a lot: I submit my blog post to Hacker News or send a tweet, and then get a shower or do something else to get my mind off it. I don&#39;t want to sit and read the comments right away. I&#39;ll do it later.</p><h2 id="working-on-less-scary-things">Working on less scary things</h2><p>Not everything has to be something that gets a lot of attention and comments. I can focus on long-term results over quick attention. </p><p>Writing a blog post that will drive traffic for years from search results. Improving my site&#39;s SEO.</p><h2 id="reminding-myself-that-its-necessary">Reminding myself that it&#39;s necessary</h2><p>I try to remind myself that I need to do marketing to earn money with my solo startup. It&#39;s just the way it is. Otherwise, people don&#39;t know my product exists, and can&#39;t pay me money although maybe they would happily do so when they would know about my product.</p>
