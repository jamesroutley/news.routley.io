    <h1>What Happens When a Fifteen Year Old Pumps and Dumps with a Net Profit of $800k? (2002)</h1>

<p><b>Case Study: What Happens When a Fifteen Year Old Pumps and Dumps,
Obtaining a Net Profit of Nearly $800,000?<span> 
</span>The SEC Settles for $285,000.<o:p></o:p></b></p>



<p>Jonathan Lebed and
two of his friends came in fourth place in a stock-picking contest sponsored by
CNBC when he was just twelve years old.<span> 
</span>They had managed to turn an imaginary $10,000 into $240,000 during the
first round of the competition.<span>  </span>From
there, Lebed was able to convince his parents to invest money in the stock
market on his behalf.<span>  </span>His parents first
opened an Ameritrade account for him, and upon his mother’s decision to close
that account, his father opened an E*Trade account for him.<span>  </span>During two years of trading, Lebed made a
minimum of 27 trades, and netted nearly $800,000.<span>  </span>The SEC later investigated these 27 trades and eventually
declared eleven of them as illegal trades and forced to Lebed to pay
approximately $272,000 in fines and over $12,000 in interest.<span>  </span>In particular, these eleven trades occurred
during the five and a half month period between August 23, 1999, and February
4, 2000.<span>  </span>While Lebed never admitted or
denied the findings by the SEC, he consented to entry of the findings and the
imposition of sanctions.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[1]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a></p>

<p>The SEC findings
asserted that Lebed would purchase large blocks of thinly traded microcap
stocks, post between 200 and 300 messages on the Yahoo! Finance message boards,
hyping the stocks he had just purchased, and then sell all of the stocks he had
purchased, usually within twenty-four hours of said purchase.<span>  </span>The messages that Lebed posted would predict
marked increases in the stocks value, i.e. he would post comments that this
stock would be the “next stock to gain 1,000%” or that a stock currently
trading at just over a dollar would be trading at more than $20 per share “very
soon.”<span>  </span>In response to Lebed’s messages,
trading volume of these stocks would soar on average from 60,000 shares per day
to over a million shares on the days he posted his messages.<span>   </span>For the eleven trades that the SEC declared
its findings, Lebed realized a net profit of $272,826.<span>  </span>The individual gross profits ranged from
over $11,000 per trade to nearly $74,000.<span> 
</span>Lebed professes that he did nothing wrong – he did nothing different
from Wall Street analysts.<span>  </span>He states
that he learned how people react to the stock market and acted on that
knowledge.<span>  </span>According to Lebed’s
friends, even Lebed’s teachers would follow his advice regarding the stock
market.<span>  </span>While one of Lebed’s friends
lost a significant amount of money on one of the trades Lebed pushed, he states
“[i]n the stock market, you go in knowing you can lose.<span>  </span>We were just doing what Jon was doing, but not
doing as good a job at it.”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[2]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a></p>

<p>Depending on who
you talk to, Lebed was either viewed as a person who knowingly abused the
system and broke the law, or someone who acted no differently than Wall Street
analysts acted and was able to use the system to his advantage, actually
performing no wrong-doing.<span>  </span>Lebed’s own
father stated on 60 Minutes that he was proud of his son and that he hadn’t
done anything wrong.<span>  </span>This belief can
also be evinced by the fact that after Lebed’s first meeting with the SEC,
while his mother closed the Ameritrade account, Lebed’s father opened an
E*Trade account so that Lebed could continue to trade stocks.<span>  </span>The SEC, however, stated that Lebed violated
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the
Exchange Act.<span>  </span>These Acts “prohibit
acts, transactions, practices or course of business that operate as a fraud or
deceit in connection with the offer, purchase or sale of securities, including
misrepresentation and omissions of material fact.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[3]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a><span>  </span>The SEC therefore ordered Lebed pay his fine
and to “cease and desist” from causing any further violation of Section 17(a).</p>

<p>Even the news
articles that covered Lebed’s actions appear split on whether he had done
anything wrong.<span>  </span>While an article
written by Peter Carbonara for Money Magazine<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[4]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a>
appears to favor the SEC decision (albeit wondering why the SEC let Lebed keep
the remaining $500,000 of profit), Michael Lewis, writing for New York Times
Magazine,<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[5]<!--[endif]--></span></span></a>
acknowledges that there were victims who suffered from Lebed’s actions, yet asserts
that the SEC only settled because they believed they would not be able to win
in court, and that its evidence was not as strong as it had alleged. </p>
