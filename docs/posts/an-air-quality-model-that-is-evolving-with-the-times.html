<p>The quality of the air we breathe is among the biggest factors influencing human health and well-being worldwide. Air pollution—from fossil fuel combustion in the power, industrial, residential, and transportation sectors as well as from wildfires, agricultural practices, and many other sources—<a href="https://eos.org/articles/the-complex-relationship-between-hurricanes-air-pollution-and-climate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interacts with the climate</a>, <a href="https://eos.org/articles/wildfire-particulates-raise-cardiopulmonary-health-concerns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exacerbates</a> <a href="https://eos.org/articles/stroke-deaths-rise-life-expectancy-falls-with-polluted-air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countless</a> <a href="https://eos.org/articles/air-pollution-linked-to-adverse-mental-health-effects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical</a> <a href="https://eos.org/research-spotlights/establishing-a-link-between-air-pollution-and-dementia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conditions</a>, and is estimated to cause <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">millions of deaths annually</a>.</p>

<p>Safeguarding public health and combating climate change depend on robust impact assessments and eﬀective policymaking with respect to air quality, which in turn require an accurate understanding of air composition and the processes that control how and why it changes.</p>

<p>For decades, scientists have applied multiscale modeling approaches informed by observations to help advance the understanding and predictability of air quality and its interactions with the climate. Such investigations are becoming more in-depth, more capable of revealing details of the processes at play, and more accessible to broader communities.</p>

<p>Key to the continued success of such approaches is that the models used keep up with advances in scientific knowledge, modeling techniques, and the capabilities of Earth-observing systems and that the valuable features of the models are well recognized by the scientists and decisionmakers who interpret their results.</p>

<p>Here we look back on the history of one such influential model, the pioneering Sulfur Transport and Deposition Model (STEM), and we look forward to how it can keep revealing more about air quality, climate, and other societally important issues.</p>

<h3><strong>Sulfur Model Shows the Way</strong></h3>

<figure><blockquote><p>Development of the Sulfur Transport and Deposition Model (STEM) started in 1976. At the time, fossil fuel consumption was setting records, and effective technologies for scrubbing sulfur species from emissions were not widely implemented.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Development of STEM started in 1976, much earlier than many other contemporary air quality and atmospheric chemistry models. At the time, fossil fuel consumption was setting records, and effective technologies for scrubbing sulfur species from emissions were not widely implemented. The resulting atmospheric <a href="https://eos.org/research-spotlights/effects-of-acid-rain-climate-change-on-freshwater-lakes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sulfur pollution and acid rain</a> caused increasingly negative impacts on humans, infrastructure, and ecosystems. These impacts also raised awareness that air pollution was not just a local problem: Emissions from one place could affect other places hundreds and even thousands of kilometers downwind. STEM was initially designed to help understand the transport, transformation, and removal processes of atmospheric sulfur and to inform emissions reduction strategies [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0004-6981(84)90070-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael and Peters</em></a>, 1984].</p>


<p>Since its creation, STEM has evolved to cover a broader set of key air pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, which also cause regional and even intercontinental problems [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0960-1686(91)90085-L" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael et al.</em></a>, 1991; <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Huang et al.</em></a>, 2017]. Coupled with widely used meteorological models, including multiple versions of the <a href="https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weather Research and Forecasting</a> and <a href="https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/mm5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MM5</a> models, STEM has been adopted to study air quality in the United States and regions in the Arctic, Asia, and South America, contributing to hundreds of peer-reviewed publications. These studies have highlighted the usefulness of such models for addressing a wide range of scientific questions related to the atmospheric distributions of chemicals, quantification of these chemicals’ environmental impacts, and evaluation of environmental mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>By answering these science questions, STEM also has demonstrated the capability of models to support the design and deployment of airborne and ground-based ﬁeld experiments, many of which have been <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JD003117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led by NASA</a> or other agencies. For example, during the 2001 NASA Transport and Chemical Evolution over the Pacific (<a href="https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/missions/tracep/tracep.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TRACE-P</a>) experiment, based out of Hong Kong, STEM forecasts of pollution outflow regions over the Pacific Ocean were used daily to help plan locations for aircraft sampling of air pollutants (Figure 1). Applying STEM in the field by design also enabled its use in interpreting and providing context for collected observations, which in turn helped improve the model [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2002JD003117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael et al.</em></a>, 2003]. The use of air quality models in such forecast applications has since expanded dramatically, and today these models are used operationally at urban, national, and global scales.</p>

<p>STEM has further served scientific communities by advancing satellite missions, such as <a href="https://aura.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aura</a>. It has supported <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2346/background-ozone-a-major-issue-in-us-west/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">novel applications</a> of the main data products from Aura’s onboard sensors [e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JD022993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Huang et al.</em></a>, 2015], for example, and stimulated development and evaluation of <a href="https://asdc.larc.nasa.gov/project/TES/TL2OCSN_8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new retrieval products</a>. And it has contributed to international multimodel intercomparison experiments, including the <a href="https://www.acap.asia/en/research-main/mics-asia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model Inter-Comparison Study for Asia</a> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1352-2310(01)00448-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Carmichael et al.</em></a>, 2002] and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Task Force on Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution</a> [<a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Huang et al.</em></a>, 2017]. These experiments helped provide more robust estimates of air pollution source-receptor relationships and environmental impacts, and they helped scientists better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the various models compared.</p>

<h3><strong>Simplicity, Stability, and Flexibility</strong></h3>

<figure><blockquote><p>The long history and wide applications of STEM have helped shape its main technical strengths.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>The long history and wide applications of STEM have helped shape its main technical strengths. These strengths include its structural simplicity, which allows users to make changes to it easily, and its stability, which is built upon decades of tuning with field and laboratory measurements and other information from past applications. In addition, it features ﬂexible tools to generate chemical boundary conditions and other key inputs as well as advanced data assimilation capability. Of particular note is the development of the <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~asandu/Software/Kpp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kinetic PreProcessor</a> software, which allowed for easily changing the chemical mechanisms used in STEM (and other models) and improved its ability to assimilate observational data [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2004.10.011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Sandu et al.</em></a>, 2005].</p>

<p>These features have enabled researchers using the model to make notable policy-relevant scientific contributions in both the air quality and climate communities and to train dozens of students and early-career scientists globally. Such contributions include using real-world observations to derive surface-atmosphere ﬂuxes of short- and long-lived climate forcers and their precursors—such as nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), carbonyl sulfide (COS), and toxic airborne materials including mercury compounds—and to understand the factors controlling them [e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1164015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Campbell et al.</em></a>, 2008].</p>

<p>STEM also has helped in attributing the effects of aerosols on air quality and climate to emissions from different source sectors (e.g., energy production, industrial processes, transportation, residential sources, and wildfires) and in identifying sources of air pollution as atmospheric circulation and emissions patterns shift under the changing climate [e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Ramanathan and Carmichael</em></a>, 2008; <em>Huang et al.</em>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.01.021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2012</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/2014JD022993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2015</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-17-5721-2017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017</a>].</p>

<p>These studies based on the STEM model have inspired subsequent research and discussions about new applications. For example, they stimulated discussions on using COS as <a href="https://eos.org/features/assessing-a-new-clue-to-how-much-carbon-plants-take-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a proxy for gross primary productivity</a> because of the link between plants’ uptake of COS and CO<sub>2</sub>, which further led to developing and applying satellite-based data products to track COS.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, researchers are continuing to develop methods to reduce uncertainties in estimating how aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions from different regions and source sectors affect health and climate. In part, these efforts involve integrating Earth observations across multiple disciplines to improve process-level constraints used in making these estimates. Observation-driven analyses are also being advanced to improve estimates of background air pollution levels, information that is relevant for updating air quality standards as the climate changes.</p>

<h3><strong>Keeping Current to Stay Relevant</strong></h3>

<figure><blockquote><p>As productive as STEM has been through its history, updating it is necessary to ensure that it remains a robust option for air quality and climate scientists to study our environment and to inform policymaking.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p>Maintaining and enhancing the diversity of models available for air quality science and management are important because significant uncertainties remain in the predictions (and their implications) from individual models. In addition, as productive as STEM has been through its history, updating it (and similar models) is necessary to ensure that it remains a robust option for air quality and climate scientists to study our environment and to inform policymaking and the design of atmospheric observing systems.</p>

<p>Major updates to STEM are ongoing to improve how the model interfaces with up-to-date and next-generation meteorological and land surface modeling systems. These systems include, for example, the <a href="https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/mpas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model for Prediction Across Scales</a>, which can be run at variable resolutions, and the <a href="https://ral.ucar.edu/model/noah-multiparameterization-land-surface-model-noah-mp-lsm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Noah-Multiparameterization land surface model</a>, which can simulate vegetation dynamics under many configurations. Such updates can facilitate improved representations of processes like atmospheric deposition. STEM also will be more closely integrated with regional and global climate models, and it will be applied at progressively finer, satellite-resolved scales of several kilometers or less.</p>

<p>We continue to collect community input on goals and updates for STEM, and suggestions are always welcome. Ideally, STEM (and other chemical transport models) should be adapted to perform on new generations of high-performance supercomputing systems, perhaps in combination with <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/24938/chapter/7#177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commercial cloud computing</a>, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and other technologies.</p>

<p>Additional updates could include capabilities to provide detailed documentation of model elements, features, and steps to execute it, as well as polished postprocessing and visualization routines to help improve the interpretability and communication of model results. Further, models could be updated to support crowdsourced science projects, by integrating data from or feeding data to them, and the design and application of low-cost spaceborne and surface observing systems. User communities should be able to access and contribute easily to synthesized and modernized models and their associated documentation from centralized, open-access platforms.</p>

<p>These updates would allow models like STEM to be implemented over wider spatial and time scales than previously possible and to support studies of emerging topics, such as those <a href="https://eos.org/articles/some-communities-feel-the-effects-of-air-pollution-more-than-others" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">related to environmental justice</a>. Simulations of regional to local air quality as well as of its contributing factors, combined with socioeconomic data, could clarify the picture of <a href="https://eos.org/articles/indias-disadvantaged-groups-face-more-air-pollution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">environmental inequity</a> across an area of interest and help evaluate potential solutions involving migration, relocation, or <a href="https://eos.org/science-updates/converging-on-solutions-to-plan-sustainable-cities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urban</a> or <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/video/what-ecosystem-based-adaptation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ecosystem</a> adaptations.</p>

<p>For decades, the STEM model has proven its value by contributing insights into air quality, climate, and the environment to help shape scientific understanding, science-based policymaking, and software design. With the ongoing and envisioned updates, the model’s usefulness for these purposes will continue for many years to come, and its relevance for new applications will grow.</p>
