<p><span><span>To non-Australians, Vegemite</span> is one of the strangest food products you’re likely to ever encounter.</span> <span>It’s a dark brown, almost black, shiny paste with a pungent scent, and a very strong, almost indescribable taste that is strongly umami and very salty.</span> </p><figure>

<p><span>It is a little like soy sauce in solid form.</span> </p><p><span>We tend to eat it on toast for breakfast.</span> <span><span></span> <span><span>The trick is not to spread it thickly like peanut butter; instead, you take about a quarter of a teaspoon’s worth and scrape it thinly over the entire slice.</span> <span>It also goes very nicely in a toasted cheese sandwich.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span> </span></p><p><span>It sounds unique, but perhaps the strangest thing about it is that it is <em>not:</em> the <span>British have Marmite, which tastes similar but is runnier, Australians have a <em>second</em> yeast extract spread called <span>Promite,<span><span></span> <span><span>In my personal opinion, even better than Vegemite.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span>  the <span>Germans and Swiss have Cenovits and Vitam-R,<span><span></span> <span><span>I haven’t tried either of these.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span>  and a <span>Latvian friend once gave me a jar of a tan-coloured, honey-consistency thick liquid he told me was like Vegemite and I (sadly) found inedible.</span> </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span>This leads to spirited debates about which is best and, like a true Australian, I mock Marmite to the British friend with whom I made Vegemite for this article,<span><span></span> <span><span>Marmite is the <em>inferior</em> product: it is not a solid paste but is runny, and has a slightly less strong taste.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span>  even as he keeps <span>Marmite in his cupboard and would never touch Vegemite.</span> <span>Both of us quietly admit they’re very similar and I have many times bought Marmite when Vegemite was not available.</span> <span><span></span> <span><span>When you live overseas, you make do with what you can get.</span> <span>In Australia, you’d never admit to eating Marmite.</span> <span>But among fraternity of overseas Aussie citizens, there’s an unspoken knowledge that we’ve all lowered ourselves to Marmite from time to time.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span> </span></span></span></p><p><span>But even if thick black pungent salted umami spreads are common, <strong>how are they made?</strong></span> <span>And <strong>what is such a strange spread really made of?</strong></span> </p><p><span>The jar claims to be a ‘yeast extract’, and Aussie rumour had it that it was made from leftovers from making beer.</span> <span>Very Australian.</span> <span>Since it was invented in the 1920s, I personally had a mental image of a specific strain of yeast fermenting to produce some precursor substance, <a href="https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/56560/can-you-make-arbitrary-food-out-of-yeast "><span>Asimov-style</span></a>.</span> </p><p><span>Then my Marmite-loving British friend sent me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukd3lg3Z_Pg ">this video</a>,<span><span></span> <span><span>From the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HowToCookThat "><em><span>How To Cook That</span></em></a> <span>Youtube channel by Ann Reardon.</span> </span> <span></span> </span>  and one afternoon we made it.</span><span> <span><span></span> <span><span>By ‘we made it’, it’s more that I’d casually mentioned I’d like to try, and then at the pub the previous evening he said he had all the ingredients and would I like to join him the next afternoon?</span> <span>In other words: his effort, his ingredients, his kitchen, and I took photos.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span> </span></span></span></p><figure>

<p><span>A homebrewing friend provided:</span></p><figure>
<img src="https://daveon.design/images/vegemite-yeast-slurry.webp"/>
</figure>
<ul>
<li><span>The yeast slurry from the bottom of a batch of beer (from a plain lager)</span></li><li><span>A fermented malt wort made from dry malt mixed with water</span></li></ul>
<p><span>The malt was very liquid and we boiled it down to a thick syrup.</span> <span>You could likely use supermarket malt.</span> </p><figure>
<img src="https://daveon.design/images/vegemite-slurry-liquid-boiling.webp"/><figcaption>Boiling the skimmed yeast slurry liquid.</figcaption><span></span>
</figure>
<p><span>The yeast slurry in Ann Reardon’s video was separated into yeast and liquids via a home-made washing-machine centrifuge.</span> <span>But our slurry had been sitting in my friend’s fridge for a few days, and he simply poured off the top.</span> <span>This liquid, a pale clear tan, we boiled down into a thick, dark brown syrup too.</span> <span>Initially, the kitchen smelled like hot beer, but it soon changed to smell like something recognisable as a Vegemite-like scent.</span> <span><span></span> <span><span>It was not unpleasant—if you like Vegemite—but it was strong, and at some point despite the winter outside every window in the apartment was opened.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span> </span></p><figure>
<img src="https://daveon.design/images/vegemite-boiling-down.webp%20"/><figcaption role="complementary "><span>Left: the malt reducing to a syrup; right: the slurry liquid also being boiled down.</span> </figcaption><span><span></span>
</span></figure><p><span>A good half-liter or more of yeast-slurry-liquid turned into only a couple of tablespoons of dense brown syrup.</span> <span>This is definitely a recipe where large starting volumes are needed, and you won’t get a large quantity result.</span> </p><figure>
<img src="https://daveon.design/images/vegemite-boiled-malt-and-slurry-liquid-2.webp%20"/><figcaption role="complementary "><span>The resulting two syrups: on the left, heavily reduced malt wort to a very dark, sweet, flavourful syrup; on the right, the main Vegemite flavour comes from the boiled-down reduction from the yeast slurry.</span> </figcaption><span><span></span>
</span></figure><p><span>The final major ingredient is nutritional yeast.</span> <span>We mixed several tablespoons with warm water to make a light yellow sludge.</span> <span><span></span> <span><span>The names for the ingredients—slurries, sludges—are as appetizing as many non-Australians claim Vegemite to be.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span> </span></p><h3 id="taste-testing">Taste Testing</h3>
<p><span>A taste test gave:</span></p><ul>
<li><span>Boiled slurry liquid: Vegemite or Marmite overtones, but surprisingly bitter (perhaps the result of hops?)</span> </li><li><span>Boiled, thick malt: unexpectedly, a strong ‘this taste is not Vegemite but is in Vegemite’ response.</span> <span><span></span> <span><span>Vegemite does not taste like malt, and you would never eat Vegemite and think of malt, yet boiled-down malt wort syrup distinctly resembles very sweet Vegemite.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span> </span></li></ul>

<p><img src="https://daveon.design/images/vegemite-mixing-2.webp"/></p></div>
<p><span>The Youtube video has no proportions, and even with large quantities of starting liquids we had only teaspoons of boiled-down results.</span> <span>Taking the entire boiled-down yeast slurry runoff liquid, perhaps three teaspoons or a little more, we added about half a teaspoon of malt, a generous dash of salt<span><span></span> <span><span>Vegemite is very salty.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span>  and about a teaspoon of nutritional yeast sludge.</span> <span>Some vigorous mixing, some adjustment (a tiny bit more malt, plus a bit more salt)<span><span></span> <span><span>Vegemite is <em>very</em> salty.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span>  and we deemed it done.</span> </span></span></p><figure>
<img src="https://daveon.design/images/vegemite-result.webp%20"/><figcaption role="complementary "><span>The appetizingly-coloured result!</span> </figcaption><span><span></span>
</span></figure><p><span>It was not the right colour.</span> <span>Nor did it taste exactly like Vegemite, though it was very close.</span> <span>But the taste was <em>exactly</em> like <span>Marmite!</span> </span></p></section><section><h2 id="taste-tests">Taste Tests</h2>
<p><span>British friend:</span></p><blockquote>
<span>Bang on.</span> <span>Yeah.</span> <span>Feels like you should make it with beer that’s not very hoppy.</span> </blockquote>
<p><span>Friend’s partner:</span></p><blockquote>
<span>Really really close.</span> <span>A little more bitter maybe.</span> </blockquote>
<p><span>My partner:</span></p><blockquote>
<span>It’s softer, and more bitter, than Marmite.</span> <span>Marmite is very sticky, and this lacks the stickiness of Marmite.</span> <span>But it still tastes like Marmite.</span> </blockquote>
<p><span>To me: There was a strong hit of salt and then it fades into distinct Marmite flavour.</span> <span>Then a slight unwanted bitter note.</span> <span>The aftertaste is just like Vegemite.</span> <span>The next day, cold from the fridge, it seemed more sharp in flavour than the previous day.</span> <span>Overall, very in the Vegemite/Marmite family.</span> </p></section></section><section>
<p><span><span>In the same taste-test,</span> we also tried a variant made by our Czech friend who supplied the beer slurry.</span> <span>He was not interested in recreating Vegemite <em>per se,</em> but in creating an umami stock he could use for cooking.</span> <span>So he’d boiled it down with stock cubes and a lot more malt: the colour was right (very dark due to the malt) but it was sweet and very much not Vegemite.</span> </p><p><span>For ours, the main consensus is that there is a hint more bitterness in our Mite than in Vegemite.</span> <span>This may be due to the beer that provided the slurry: it came from a well-hopped lager.</span> <span>Perhaps we need to add more malt to offset the bitterness; it’s a strong flavour though and risks overpowering the key Vegemite notes that come from the boiled-down beer slurry.</span> <span>I’d like to try again using slurry from making a stout or one of the sweeter porters, which may have fewer hops, a darker colour from the roasted grains, and could give a less bitter starting point.</span> </p><p><span>The majority of Australian beer is lager, and if Vegemite uses the most widely available beer remnants, it likely comes from some kind of light, hopped beer.</span> <span>I am curious how they get such a dark colour.</span> </p><p><span>Finally, Wikipedia claims Vegemite is made with celery and onion extracts.</span> <span>I’d like to try again using a stout/sweet porter as basis, and add celery salt and onion powder.</span> </p></section><section>
<p><span><span>What did I get for an afternoon’s</span> worth of watching beery liquids boil down in my friend’s kitchen?</span> <span>I came home with three quarters of a teaspoon of brown runny goop… and somewhat of a fascination for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justus_von_Liebig#Marmite ">how people invented this stuff in the first place</a>.</span> </p><figure>
