    <h1>Ask HN: How did you stop drinking?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I enjoy the act of drinking - literally having a drink, or the feeling right after a drink. I hate how I feel an hour later, the foggy head feeling. I have a hard time saying no to a drink if everyone else is having a drink, I have done it before and am not afraid of what they think, more so, I enjoy having a drink, but I really don’t want to any more. I think it is something I would be better off without, completely but just can’t seem to get there.</p><p>I don’t buy it for weeks at a time, then cave and have a 12 pack in a weekend and feel like garbage most of the time.</p><p>Any tips on cutting out something completely and how to get out of just hating yourself when you fail?</p></div></div></div>
