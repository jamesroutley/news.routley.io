<p>The Tomb of Nefertari, designated as QV66, is located in the Valley of the Queens near Luxor, Egypt. It is the burial site of Nefertari, one of the principal wives of Pharaoh Ramesses II (Ramesses the Great), who reigned in the 19th Dynasty of Egypt&#39;s New Kingdom period. Nefertari, known for her beauty and intelligence, held the prestigious titles of &#34;Great Royal Wife&#34; and &#34;Mistress of the Two Lands.&#34; Her tomb, uncovered in 1904 by the Italian archaeologist Ernesto Schiaparelli, is appreciated for its exquisite and well-preserved wall paintings.</p>
