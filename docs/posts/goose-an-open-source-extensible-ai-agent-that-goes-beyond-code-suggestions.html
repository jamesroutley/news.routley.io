    <h1>Goose: An open-source, extensible AI agent that goes beyond code suggestions</h1>

Thanks a ton for creating this. üôè I have been having way too much fun with it today.</p><div><p><img src="https://github.com/cloud-on-prem.png" alt="Prem Pillai&#39;s profile picture"/></p><div><p>Prem Pillai</p><p><small>Software Engineer</small></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>I wanted to construct some fake data for an API with a large request body and business rules I haven&#39;t memorized. So I told Goose which object to update and a test to run that calls the vendor. Got it to use the errors descriptions from the vendor response to keep correcting the request until it was successful. So good!</p><div><p><img src="https://github.com/jsibbison-square.png" alt="Jarrod Sibbison&#39;s profile picture"/></p><div><p>Jarrod Sibbison</p><p><small>Software Engineer</small></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>I asked Goose to write up a few Google Scripts that mimic Clockwise&#39;s functionality (particularly, creating blocks on my work calendar based on events in my personal calendar, as well as color-coding calendar entries based on type and importance). Took me under an hour. If you haven&#39;t tried Goose yet, I highly encourage you to do so!</p><div><p><img src="https://github.com/maniksurtani.png" alt="Manik Surtani&#39;s profile picture"/></p><div><p>Manik Surtani</p><p><small>Head of Open Source</small></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>If anyone was looking for another reason to check it out: I just asked Goose to break a string-array into individual string resources across eleven localizations, and it performed amazingly well and saved me a bunch of time doing it manually or figuring out some way to semi-automate it.</p><div><p><img src="https://github.com/andrey-bolduzev.png" alt="Andrey Bolduzev&#39;s profile picture"/></p><div><p>Andrey Bolduzev</p><p><small>Android Engineer</small></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>Hi team, thank you for much for making Goose, it&#39;s so amazing. Our team is working on migrating Dashboard components to React components. I am working with Goose to help the migration.</p><div><p><img src="https://github.com/kang-square.png" alt="Kang Huang&#39;s profile picture"/></p><div><p>Kang Huang</p><p><small>Software Engineer</small></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>Wanted to document what I had Goose do -- took about 30 minutes end to end! I created a custom CLI command in the gh CLI library to download in-line comments on PRs about code changes (currently they aren&#39;t directly viewable). I don&#39;t know Go that well and I definitely didn&#39;t know where to start looking in the code base or how to even test the new command was working and Goose did it all for me üòÅ</p><div><p><img src="https://github.com/lily-de.png" alt="Lily Delalande&#39;s profile picture"/></p><div><p>Lily Delalande</p><p><small>Software Engineer</small></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><p>My sister had been asking me for months to help her build a Google Docs extension but I kept putting it off. Today, we hopped on FaceTime and built one in just 30 minutes with Goose!</p><div><p><img src="https://github.com/blackgirlbytes.png" alt="Rizel Scarlett&#39;s profile picture"/></p><div><p>Rizel Scarlett</p><p><small>Developer Advocate</small></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></main></div></div>
