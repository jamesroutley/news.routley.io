<h2>A new era</h2>
<p>&#34;Kids who were in eighth grade at the start of the pandemic will be graduating from high school this year, and this unique cohort has ushered in the lowest rates of substance use we’ve seen in decades,&#34; Miech noted.</p>
<p>For alcohol, use in the past 12 months among eighth graders was at 12.9 percent in 2024, similar to 2023 levels, which are all-time lows. For 10th graders, the rate dropped significantly from 30.6 percent in 2023 to 26.1 percent, and for 12th graders, from 45.7 percent to 41.7 percent—both record lows.</p>
<p>For nicotine vaping, rates fell for 10th graders (from 17.5 percent to 15.4 percent) and remained at low levels for eighth and 12th graders. For marijuana, use remained low for eighth and 10th graders and fell significantly for 12th graders (from 29 percent to 25.8 percent). All three grades are at lows not seen since 1990.</p>
<p>For abstainers from alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine in the prior 30 days, the rate among eighth graders hit 90 percent, up from 87 percent in 2017, when it was first measured. The rate was 80 percent among 10th graders, up from 69 percent in 2017, and 67 percent for 12th graders, up from 53 percent in 2017.</p>
<p>&#34;This trend in the reduction of substance use among teenagers is <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/reported-use-most-drugs-among-adolescents-remained-low-2024">unprecedented</a>,&#34; Nora Volkow, director of NIH’s National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), said. &#34;We must continue to investigate factors that have contributed to this lowered risk of substance use to tailor interventions to support the continuation of this trend.&#34;</p>
