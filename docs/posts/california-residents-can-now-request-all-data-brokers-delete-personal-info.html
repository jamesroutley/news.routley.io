    <h1>California residents can now request all data brokers delete personal info</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
            Please scroll through all terms and conditions to the end before accepting.
        </p><div id="termsBox" tabindex="0" role="document" aria-label="Terms of use (scrollable)" aria-describedby="terms-instructions" b-nn2vph8vmz=""><div b-nn2vph8vmz=""><p b-nn2vph8vmz="">
                    By using the Delete Request and Opt-out Platform (DROP), you agree to the following Terms of Use (Terms) provided by the California Privacy Protection Agency (CalPrivacy, we, us, our).
                </p>
                <h3 b-nn2vph8vmz="">Use of DROP</h3>
                <p b-nn2vph8vmz="">
                    By submitting a deletion request through DROP, you consent to disclosure of your personal information to data brokers for purposes of processing your deletion request pursuant to Civil Code section 1798.99.80 et seq. unless or until you cancel your deletion request. Additionally, you acknowledge that data brokers receiving your deletion request will delete any non-exempt &#34;personal information,&#34; as defined in Civil Code section 1798.140(v), which pertains to you and was collected from third parties or from you in a non-&#34;first party&#34; capacity (i.e., through an interaction where you did not intend or expect to interact with the data broker).
                </p>
                <p b-nn2vph8vmz="">
                    Before submitting a deletion request, you will be required to verify you are a California “resident,” as defined in section 17014 of Title 18 of the California Code of Regulations as that section read on September 1, 2017. Verification is made with assistance from state contracted third-party vendors, including Socure and Login.gov, through the California Identity Gateway.
                </p>
                <p b-nn2vph8vmz="">
                    If you are unable to confirm your California residency through these verification service providers, you may request review of your residency classification pursuant to section 7622 of Title 11 of the California Code of Regulations. You may contact CalPrivacy by visiting this webpage: <a aria-label="https://consumer.drop.privacy.ca.gov/contactus" href="https://consumer.drop.privacy.ca.gov/contactus" b-nn2vph8vmz="">https://consumer.drop.privacy.ca.gov/contactus</a>.
                </p>
                <p b-nn2vph8vmz="">
                    In addition, you will be prompted to provide personal information, such as name, date of birth, and email address. Certain information is required to verify your residency. Otherwise, the type of information and how much you provide is up to you. However, you must only provide true and accurate information about yourself through DROP. Adding personal information about multiple people in the same request is prohibited. Information received will be used and disclosed to facilitate your request to delete and opt-out of the sale/sharing of your personal information maintained by data brokers registered with CalPrivacy. The more personal information you provide, the greater the likelihood of registered data brokers finding the personal information they maintain about you and deleting that information.
                </p>
                <p b-nn2vph8vmz="">
                    Data brokers are required to process deletion requests at least once every 45 days beginning August 1, 2026. Your submission of personal information through DROP is governed by CalPrivacy’s <a aria-label="Privacy Policy" href="https://privacy.ca.gov/privacy-policy/" b-nn2vph8vmz="">Privacy Policy</a> which is incorporated into these Terms by reference.
                </p>
                <h3 b-nn2vph8vmz="">Prohibited uses</h3>
                <p b-nn2vph8vmz="">While using DROP, you agree you will not:</p>
                <ul b-nn2vph8vmz=""><li b-nn2vph8vmz="">(a) use DROP for any fraudulent, unlawful, or prohibited purpose</li>
                    <li b-nn2vph8vmz="">(b) impersonate any person or entity or misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity</li>
                    <li b-nn2vph8vmz="">(c) interfere with or disrupt the operation of DROP, or the servers or networks used to make DROP available, including threatening the integrity or security of DROP</li>
                    <li b-nn2vph8vmz="">(d) restrict, disrupt, interfere, or inhibit any other person from using DROP</li>
                    <li b-nn2vph8vmz="">(e) reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or otherwise exploit for any commercial purposes, any portion of, use of, or access to DROP</li></ul>
                <p b-nn2vph8vmz="">Violating these terms may, on a case-by-case basis, result in restriction of your ability to access and use DROP.</p>

                <h3 b-nn2vph8vmz="">Aiding another person with their request</h3>
                <p b-nn2vph8vmz="">
                    You are only permitted to aid another consumer with their deletion request if that person has authorized you to do so and you meet the requirements described in section 7001(d) of Title 11 of the California Code of Regulations. In addition, the consumer must first have their residency verified as described in the Use of DROP section above. When aiding a consumer with their request, you or the consumer must disclose your full name, email address, and business name if applicable through DROP when prompted. In submitting information on behalf of another person, you certify that you have authorization to do so and that the information you provide is true and correct. Adding personal information about a person who has not authorized you to submit a deletion request on their behalf is prohibited.
                </p>
