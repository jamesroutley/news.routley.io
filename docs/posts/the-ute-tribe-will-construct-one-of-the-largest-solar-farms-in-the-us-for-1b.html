Officials say the project will create more than 500 local jobs for electricians and laborers.</p><p>Officials are planning to break ground on the construction of the Sun Bear Solar Farm later in 2024, with the goal of producing electricity in 2026.

<p>Canigou Group’s director, Justin Passfield, said the project will cost more than $1 billion. Passfield said electricity generated from the solar farm will connect to the Western Area Power Administration power line. Still, it’s unclear what regional entities Canigou will sell the electricity to.</p><p>“We&#39;re thinking about the power needs within Colorado,” said Passfield. “But also, it makes sense not to transmit power too far from where you are. Having said that, we&#39;re going to be producing a large amount of power. So I&#39;m not sure that all of it will be able to be consumed within Colorado.”</p><div data-align-center="">

<p>Ute Mountain Ute Chairman Manuel Heart is excited about job opportunities for Ute Mountain Ute tribal members and the opportunity for the tribe to become a significant player in renewable energy.</p><p><b>“</b>We, as the Ute Mountain Ute tribe, had been a fossil fuel tribe with oil and gas for a long time, probably over 50 years. Today, with the changes in legislation, global warming, and climate change, you can see the impact of what&#39;s happening to our world. So renewable is the new future right now,” said Heart.</p>
