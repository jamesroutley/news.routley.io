                        <p>Employees at Apple&#39;s flagship store in New York have started collecting signatures to unionize, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/04/16/apple-grand-central-station-retail-union-workers-united/" data-analytics-module="body_link">The Washington Post reported.</a></p><p>&#34;Card signing has begun!&#34; the organizers at Grand Central Terminal, known as Fruit Stand Workers United, <a href="https://fsworkersunited.org/" data-analytics-module="body_link">announced on a website dedicated to the union drive</a>. </p><p>The website states that organizers voted by majority on Monday, February 21, to affiliate with Workers United, which is a US-based labor union that has also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-workers-in-buffalo-union-vote-results-2021-12?r=US&amp;IR=T" data-analytics-module="body_link">supported unionizing Starbucks employees.</a></p><p>Employees told The Post that pay has stagnated below inflation and they were unable to hold managers accountable &#34;for alleged unfair or abusive practices.&#34;</p>
                        
                        <p>If the drive is successful, Grand Central would be the first of Apple&#39;s retail stores to organize. At least three others are trying to form a union, The Post said. Apple has around 270 stores in the US. </p><p>To form a union, at least 30% of employees at Grand Central would need to put their names down. The cards are then passed to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), who puts it to a vote. </p><p>&#34;Workers at Apple Stores in the United States are organizing, and you could be part of that effort at Grand Central,&#34; Fruit Stand Workers United website states. &#34;The Workers have the right under the law to organize to demand better wages, benefits, and working conditions from Apple.&#34;</p><p>Apple recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-08/apple-ups-benefits-for-retail-workers-in-tightening-labor-market" data-analytics-module="body_link">ramped up its employee benefits</a> for both full-time and part-time staff. The company doubled sick pay, added vacation, and extended its emergency support of children or elderly family members to its part-time staff. </p>
