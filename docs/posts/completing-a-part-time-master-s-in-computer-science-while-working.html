<p><em>“I’m going to be 29 anyways, so I might as well be 29 with a Master’s.&#34;</em></p>
<p><em>— me 5 years ago debating whether I should take classes</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On June 5, 2017, I started taking classes at Tufts University while working full time. On January 4, 2022, I submitted the final draft of my Master’s thesis. Much like my past self had hoped, I’ve made it 4 years in the future, and I’m done with my Master’s program. At the same time, I’m both very happy I did it and very happy to be done, and I’m going to describe a few thoughts about my experience.</p>
<p>For a quick visualization, this is what my work and school looked like for the last few years:</p>
<p><img src="https://alexanderell.is/posts/mscs/vis.png" alt="A visualization of my last five years as a char with time extending downwards. On the work side, my work goes from tiny company -&gt; small startup -&gt; Google, while on the school side, my classes are listed."/></p>
<p>(Fall 2020 was a busy time for me)</p>
<p>For a little background, I didn’t do any programming in college (though in retrospect I wish I had tried it), instead studying physics, French, and political science. I did a lot of self-studying on my own from roughly January 2015 onwards.</p>

<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>
<p>Overall I took 11 courses, 10 at Tufts and 1 at Oregon State University (online), and completed 2 semesters of a Master’s thesis. In rough order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Structures</li>
<li>Discrete Math</li>
<li>Algorithms</li>
<li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
<li>Theory of Computation</li>
<li>Machine Architecture &amp; Assembly (Oregon State)</li>
<li>Networks</li>
<li>Introduction to Machine Learning</li>
<li>Cloud Computing</li>
<li>Compilers</li>
<li>Debugging Cloud Computing</li>
<li>Thesis (Summer)</li>
<li>Thesis (Fall)</li>
</ul>
