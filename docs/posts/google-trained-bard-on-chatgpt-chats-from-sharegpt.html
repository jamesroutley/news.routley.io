    <p>Traditionally, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_chart">org chart</a> is represented as a tree.
You start at the top with the root of the tree, probably the CEO.
And then everything comes down from there hierarchically.</p>
<p><img src="https://ntietz.com/images/org-chart/org-chart-1.png" alt="image of an org chart"/></p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t have to be that way, though!
We can imagine other topologies for companies which would work differently.
Let&#39;s challenge assumptions one by one and see where we end up.</p>
<p>First, we have one person in charge?
Clearly not, at least in some of the organizations I&#39;ve worked with<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>!
If you have multiple leaders at the top who are not accountable to each other, then you can end up with a <strong>forest</strong> instead of a tree.
This can happen in startups where you have multiple founders with different priorities, not reporting to each other, who each head up a different tree in this little forest.</p>
<p><img src="https://ntietz.com/images/org-chart/org-chart-2.png" alt="image of an org chart"/></p>
<p>That can lead to some fun dysfunction since you have multiple <em>distinct</em> organizations now, which somehow are supposed to work together toward common good.</p>
<p>Another assumption here is that you <em>have one boss</em>.
That&#39;s common, but sometimes you have &#34;dual reporting&#34; where you have multiple bosses.
This happens in matrix structures.
But it can also happen from just plain old dysfunction!
And now the org chart forms a <strong>directed acyclic graph</strong>, or a forest of such.</p>
<p><img src="https://ntietz.com/images/org-chart/org-chart-3.png" alt="image of an org chart"/></p>
<p>Wait, we just made another assumption.
It&#39;s a directed <em>acyclic</em> graph?
Okay, what if we did introduce a cycle?
Now you have a plain old <strong>graph</strong>.</p>
<p>This could happen if one of the founders of the company controls enough voting shares to control the board.
Then you have a cycle: the founders report to the board, but the board reports to <em>that founder</em>, who themselves reports to the board, etc.
This could also happen in a very totally normal situation, like if you hire an intern and then have the CTO report to that intern.</p>
<p><img src="https://ntietz.com/images/org-chart/org-chart-4.png" alt="image of an org chart"/>
<img src="https://ntietz.com/images/org-chart/org-chart-5.png" alt="image of an org chart"/></p>
<p>Okay, another assumption that has just gone unstated in here.
Every manager has multiple direct reports.
We all know that there is a such thing as too many direct reports, because beyond a certain point you don&#39;t have the time or energy to help all of your reports.
Let&#39;s go in the other direction: each manager manages <em>one</em> direct report.
Now we&#39;ve made a <strong>linked list</strong> for our org chart!</p>
<p><img src="https://ntietz.com/images/org-chart/org-chart-6.png" alt="image of an org chart"/></p>
<p>But okay, there&#39;s still a hierarchy.
This isn&#39;t a radical departure!
No, but wait, there&#39;s a twist:
It&#39;s a <strong>doubly linked list</strong>.
Everyone has one &#34;next&#34; direct report and a &#34;previous&#34; direct report (unless they&#39;re at the end of the list).
Functionally, you&#39;re now your boss&#39;s boss, so that&#39;ll teach you to give me a bad performance review.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>You can&#39;t fire me, <em>you&#39;re</em> fired!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each person is, transitively, each other person&#39;s boss.
This keeps the power balance, and there are no problems that could ever arise from this.
Only rainbows and unicorns.</p>
<p><img src="https://ntietz.com/images/org-chart/org-chart-7.png" alt="image of an org chart"/></p>
<p>Or we can just lean into it and make it explicit.
You want to be everyone&#39;s boss?
You&#39;ve got it!
And you&#39;ve also now got everyone as your boss!
We make all these connections explicit, and form a <strong>complete graph</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ntietz.com/images/org-chart/org-chart-8.png" alt="image of an org chart"/></p>
<p>Oh no, chaos!
Who could have predicted!</p>
<p>I guess the traditional organization design has a reason behind it.
There are legitimate quibbles, and I think there are some interesting ideas.
In particular, employee-owned cooperatives give <em>some</em> measure of &#34;the CEO reports to the intern,&#34; and I&#39;m curious if there are any other ideas that change the org chart in <em>productive</em> ways.
Anyone have <em>right</em> answers here?</p>

It has a few trees, some disconnected wholly and some which have dual-reporting shared committees.</p>
