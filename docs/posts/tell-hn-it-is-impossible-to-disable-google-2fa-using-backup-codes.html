    <h1>Tell HN: It is impossible to disable Google 2FA using backup codes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I would like to inform the HN community, if your plan to recover your Google account in the event of losing your phone is to use a 2FA backup code, or SMS recovery, to remove the old 2FA setup and set up a new 2FA code, that that may not be possible.</p><p>My situation:</p><p>I had 2FA set up with my Google Account through Google Authenticator.</p><p>I lost my Google Authenticator settings when I broke my phone.</p><p>I have 2FA backup codes.  These successfully log me into my Google Account.</p><p>In order to disable 2FA, or generate new 2FA backup codes, I need to access the 2FA settings page under the Security tab.  When I try to load the Two-factor authentication page, I am forced to re-authenticate with Google.</p><p>When re-authenticating to access the 2FA page, there is no option to enter a 2FA backup code or SMS verification to pass the 2FA challenge.  The only option under &#34;Choose a way to verify&#34; is to enter a 2FA code.  Entering a backup code instead of a 2FA code returns an error.</p><p>What am I supposed to do in this situation?</p><p>Yes this is a classic &#34;maybe I can get support through public shaming&#34; attempt.  Thanks in advance.</p></div></div></div>
