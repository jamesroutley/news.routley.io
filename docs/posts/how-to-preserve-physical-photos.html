    <h1>How to Preserve Physical Photos</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><section itemprop="articleBody"><div><p>Remember that dusty shoebox of old photos you found in Grandma&#39;s attic? Or that
album from your parents&#39; wedding that&#39;s starting to yellow at the edges? These
aren&#39;t just pictures – they&#39;re time machines, portals to the past, and
irreplaceable pieces of your family&#39;s story. But here&#39;s the kicker: they won&#39;t
last forever unless we step in.</p><p>At Ente, we&#39;re all about preserving memories (digitally, that is), but we know
that those physical snapshots hold a special place in your heart. So, for the
sake of your great-grand kids, let&#39;s roll up our sleeves and dive into the world
of photo preservation.</p><center>

the Library of Congress. Their Civil War photograph preservation project stands
as a testament to the power of proper photo care.</p><p>&#34;These photographs are national treasures,&#34; says Adrienne Lundgren, Senior
Photograph Conservator at the Library of Congress. &#34;They provide an incredible
window into one of the most defining periods of American history.&#34;</p><p>The project has successfully conserved thousands of fragile 150-year-old images,
making them accessible to the public while ensuring their longevity. Some key
achievements include:</p><ul><li>Preserving over 7,000 glass plate negatives from the Civil War era</li><li>Digitizing the entire collection for online access</li><li>Developing new conservation techniques for 19th-century photographic processes</li></ul><p>&#34;Proper storage and digitization have been key to this success,&#34; Lundgren notes.
&#34;These techniques aren&#39;t just for national institutions – many can be applied by
individuals preserving their own family photographs.&#34;</p><p>You can explore the preserved Civil War photographs on the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/civil-war-glass-negatives/about-this-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Library of Congress
website</a>.</p><p>Source: <a href="https://lccn.loc.gov/2011649977" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://lccn.loc.gov/2011649977</a></p><p>Inspired? Let&#39;s get started on preserving your own photographic treasures.</p><h4 id="1-creating-a-safe">1. Creating a safe</h4><p>Your photos need a cozy, stable home. Aim for:</p><ul><li>Temperature: A cool 65-70°F (18-21°C)</li><li>Humidity: A comfy 30-40%</li><li>Location: Think interior closet, not damp basement or stuffy attic</li></ul><p>Pro tip: Got a dehumidifier? Your photos (and your sinuses) will thank you!</p><h4 id="2-picking-a-folder">2. Picking a folder</h4><p>Protect your photos with:</p><ul><li>Acid-free, lignin-free boxes </li><li>Polyethylene, polypropylene, or Mylar sleeves </li><li>Archival-quality albums </li></ul><h4 id="3-handling-with-care">3. Handling with care</h4><ul><li>Channel your inner surgeon: clean hands or cotton gloves</li><li>Hold photos by the edges like they&#39;re priceless artifacts (because they are!)</li><li>No snacking while sorting! (Cheeto fingers are photo enemies)</li></ul><h4 id="4-organizing">4. Organizing</h4><ul><li>Sort by date, person, or event – whatever tells your family&#39;s story best</li><li>Label gently on the back with a soft pencil – your descendants will bless your
name</li><li>Create a digital catalog – spreadsheets can be cool</li></ul><h4 id="5-displaying">5. Displaying</h4><ul><li>Use UV-protective glass in frames</li><li>Keep photos out of direct sunlight</li><li>Rotate your display to give all photos a break</li></ul><p>Better yet, display a high-quality copy and keep the original safely stored.
Best of both worlds!</p><h4 id="6-digital-backups">6. Digital backups</h4><p>Here&#39;s where Ente&#39;s expertise shines! While we&#39;re all about those physical
originals, having a digital backup is like photo insurance.</p><ul><li>Scan at high resolution (at least 600 dpi)</li><li>Save as TIFF for top quality</li><li>Store copies in multiple places</li></ul><h2 id="special-care">Special care</h2><p>Different types of photos need different TLC:</p><ul><li>Black and White: Generally stable, but watch for silver mirroring</li><li>Color: More prone to fading, so keep them in darker storage</li><li>Polaroids: Super sensitive! Individual sleeves and dark storage are a must</li><li>Negatives and Slides: Store separately in format-specific archival materials</li></ul><h2 id="first-aid">First aid</h2><p>For minor issues, try these quick fixes:</p><ul><li>Dusty photos? Gently brush with a soft, clean brush or use compressed air.</li><li>Slightly torn? Apply archival tape to the back (never the front!).</li><li>Curled edges? Flatten between acid-free paper with a light weight on top.</li></ul><p>Always test on a less precious photo first!</p><h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap up</h2><p>Preserving your family photos might seem like a big task, but it&#39;s really about
taking small, consistent steps to protect your legacy. Start with one album, one
box, or even just that one precious photo of your grandparents on their wedding
day.</p><p>Remember, at Ente, we&#39;re all about keeping memories safe in the digital realm.
But we know that those physical photos hold a special kind of magic. By
following this guide, you&#39;re ensuring that the smiles, the awkward hairstyles,
and the love captured in those images will continue to tell your family&#39;s story
for generations to come.</p><hr/><p>Note: This blog post is for informational purposes only. While we strive to
