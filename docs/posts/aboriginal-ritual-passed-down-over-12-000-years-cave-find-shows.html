</div><p>Two slightly burnt, fat-covered sticks discovered inside an Australian cave are evidence of a healing ritual that was passed down unchanged by more than 500 generations of Indigenous people over the last 12,000 years, according to new research.</p>


										      
																																	<p>The wooden sticks, found poking out of tiny fireplaces, showed that the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/ritual/" rel="tag">ritual</a> documented in the 1880s had been shared via oral traditions since the end of the last ice age, a study in the journal <i>Nature Human Behaviour</i> said on Monday.</p>
<p>The discovery was made inside Cloggs Cave in the foothills of the Victorian Alps in Australia&#39;s southeast, in a region long inhabited by the Gunaikurnai people.</p>
<p>When the cave was first excavated in the 1970s, archaeologists discovered the remains of a long extinct giant kangaroo that had previously lived there.</p>
<p>But the Gunaikurnai people were not involved in those digs, &#34;nor were they asked for permission to do research there&#34;, lead study author Bruno David of Monash University told AFP.</p>
<p>Further excavations starting from 2020 included members of the local Gunaikurnai Land and Waters Aboriginal Corporation (GLaWAC).</p>
<p>Carefully digging through the soil, the team found a small stick poking out—then they found another one. Both well-preserved sticks were made from the wood of casuarina trees.</p>
<p>Each one was found in a separate fireplace around the size of the palm of a hand—far too small to have been used for heat or cooking meat.</p>
<p>The slightly charred ends of the sticks had been cut specially to stick into the fire, and both were coated in human or animal fat.</p>
<p>One stick was 11,000 years old and the other 12,000 years old, radiocarbon dating found.</p>

																																						
																																			<h2>&#39;Memoirs of our ancestors&#39;</h2>
<p>&#34;They&#39;ve been waiting here all this time for us to learn from them,&#34; said Gunaikurnai elder Russell Mullett, a co-author of the study and head of GLaWAC.</p>
<p>Mullett spent years trying to find out what they could have been used for, before discovering the accounts of Alfred Howitt, a 19th-century Australian anthropologist who studied Aboriginal culture.</p>
<p>Some of Howitt&#39;s notes had never been published, and Mullett said he spent a long time convincing a local museum to share them.</p>
<p>In the notes, Howitt describes in the late 1880s the rituals of Gunaikurnai medicine men and women called &#34;mulla-mullung&#34;.</p>
<p>One ritual involved tying something that belonged to a sick person to the end of a throwing stick smeared in human or kangaroo fat. The stick was thrust into the ground before a small fire was lit underneath.</p>
<p>&#34;The mulla-mullung would then chant the name of the sick person, and once the stick fell, the charm was complete,&#34; a Monash University statement said.</p>
<p>The sticks used in the ritual were made of casuarina wood, Howitt noted.</p>
<p>Jean-Jacques Delannoy, a French geomorphologist and study co-author, told AFP that &#34;there is no other known gesture whose symbolism has been preserved for such a long time&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;Australia kept the memory of its first peoples alive thanks to a powerful oral tradition that enabled it to be passed on,&#34; Delannoy said.</p>
<p>&#34;However in our societies, memory has changed since we switched to the written word, and we have lost this sense.&#34;</p>
<p>He lamented that the ancient animal paintings found in French caves would probably &#34;never reveal their meaning&#34; in a similar way.</p>
<p>Indigenous Australians are one of the oldest continuous living cultures, and Mullett said the discovery was a &#34;unique opportunity to be able to read the memoirs of our ancestors&#34;.</p>
<p>It was &#34;a reminder that we are a living culture still connected to our ancient past,&#34; he added.</p>
