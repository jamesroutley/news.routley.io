    <h1>Avoid the nightmare bicycle</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In my opinion, one of the most important ideas in product design is to avoid the “nightmare bicycle”.</p>

<p>Imagine a bicycle where the product manager said: “people don’t get math so we can’t have numbered gears. We need labeled buttons for gravel mode, downhill mode, …”</p>

<p>This is the hypothetical “nightmare bicycle” that Andrea diSessa imagines in his book <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262541329/changing-minds/">Changing Minds</a>.</p>

<p>As he points out: it would be terrible! We’d lose the intuitive understanding of how to use the gears to solve any situation we encounter. Which mode do you use for gravel + downhill?</p>

<p>It turns out, anyone can understand numbered gears totally fine after a bit of practice. People are capable!</p>

<p>Along the same lines: one of the worst misconceptions in product design is that a microwave needs to have a button for every thing you could possibly cook: “popcorn”, “chicken”, “potato”, “frozen vegetable”, bla bla bla.</p>

<p>You really don’t! You can just have a time (and power) button. People will figure out how to cook stuff.</p>

<p>Good designs expose systematic structure; they lean on their users’ ability to understand this structure and apply it to new situations. We were born for this.</p>

<p>Bad designs paper over the structure with superficial labels that hide the underlying system, inhibiting their users’ ability to actually build a clear model in their heads.</p>

<p>p.s. Changing Minds is one of the best books ever written about design and computational thinking, you should go read it.</p>
