    <h1>It&#39;s easier than ever to de-censor videos</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last month I asked people to <a href="https://youtu.be/gaV-O6NPWrI?t=297">hack part of my YouTube video</a>, specifically to de-pixelate the contents of a folder I had pixelated starting at the 4:57 mark.</p>

<p>For years, people have used the censor tool to blur or pixelate out parts of videos where there&#39;s sensitive information. And for years, every time I&#39;ve used it, I get a few comments from people saying that&#39;s not a safe way to censor information.</p>

<p>So is that true?</p>

<p>I wanted to find out, so I put a message saying I&#39;d send fifty bucks to anyone who could tell me what it said under the pixelation. And you know what? Less than a day later, <em>three</em> people solved it, using three slightly different techniquesâ€”scary!</p>

<p>This blog post is a lightly edited transcript of the following video:</p>

<h2>How did they do it?</h2>

<p>But how did they do it? I asked each of them, and they were more than happy to share. For most of us who like reverse-engineering or tinkering, it&#39;s fun to share the craft. And even more fun when it&#39;s <em>sanctioned</em> fun. Add on a little monetary reward, and that&#39;s just icing on the cake.</p>

<p>GitHub user KoKuToru was kind enough to share <a href="https://github.com/KoKuToru/de-pixelate_gaV-O6NPWrI">an entire GitHub repo</a> with the process and the code, along with two different ways that user tried to depixlate my footage.</p>

<p>First a <a href="https://github.com/KoKuToru/de-pixelate_gaV-O6NPWrI/tree/master/v1">brute-force attempt</a> to extract aligned images of just the window, with some code using TensorFlow to extract pixel data and aggregate it into a somewhat-fuzzy (but almost clear enough to read) picture:</p>

<p>The idea here is the pixelation is kind of like shutters over a picture. As you move the image beneath, you can peek into different parts of the picture. As long as you have a solid frame of reference, like the window that stays the same size, you can &#39;accumulate&#39; pixel data from the picture underneath.</p>

<p>Due to the slight error in selecting the window by hand, the final result was slightly blotchy. For the second attempt, GIMP was used to get a better window selection algorithm with ffmpeg, and with a slight bit more data (more frames extracted), a perfectly legible result:</p>

<h2>Any way to prevent it?</h2>

<p>Blurring or pixelating video, especially <em>moving</em> video, may lead to similar results as you saw here. Years ago it would&#39;ve required a supercomputer and a PhD to do this stuff. But today, between AI assistance with the trickier bits of coding, and how fast neural networks run on computers, it&#39;s easier and faster than ever to de-pixelate video!</p>

<p>If there&#39;s one thing computers are good at, it&#39;s finding order in seeming chaos, like how modern tools can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7msuhEq1Vz4">pull a clean voice out of a horrible recording</a>.</p>

<p>The more motion in the video, the more data points the reverse engineering has to play with. And thus, the better the confidence in the results.</p>

<p>If I <em>hadn&#39;t</em> moved around my Finder window in the video, I don&#39;t think it would&#39;ve worked. You might get a couple letters right, but it would be very low confidence.</p>

<p>Moving forward, if I <em>do</em> have sensitive data to hide, I&#39;ll place a pure-color mask over the area, instead of a blur or pixelation effect.</p>

<p>Intuitively, blur might do better than pixelation... but that might just be my own monkey brain talking. I&#39;d love to hear more in the comments if you&#39;ve dealt with that kind of image processing in the past.</p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing what people can do with a neural network, ingenuity, and time.</p>

<p>I guess the moral of the story is <em>if you don&#39;t want people to read censored data... don&#39;t post it online</em>.</p>
