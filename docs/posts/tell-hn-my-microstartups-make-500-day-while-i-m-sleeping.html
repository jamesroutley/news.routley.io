    <h1>Tell HN: My Microstartups make $500/day while I&#39;m sleeping</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> Hello everyone,<p>I’m Hari, and I’m a serial Microstartup Maker. 2021 has been an amazing year despite the pandemic where I reached my recent goal of $500/day. Compounding works everywhere, even in microstartups. It took 3 years to reach to $300/day but just 4 months to $500/day. The business model of my microstartups is a mix of App sales, subscriptions, affiliates and ads. I&#39;m now spending just 10% of my time to maintain and fix bugs. My next goal is to reach $600/day.</p><p>My Microstartups Rewind 2021</p><p>* Revenue - $117K/year (67% ▲)</p><p>* Expenses - 3K/year</p><p>* All time high revenue - $15K/month in Dec (18% ▲)</p><p>* Daily goal - $500/day reached in Dec</p><p>Visa List - https://visalist.io</p><p>* Revenue - $50K/year (39% ▲)</p><p>* All time high revenue - $8K/month in Dec</p><p>* Total Users - 2.6M/year</p><p>* Active users - 250K/month</p><p>AnExplorer - https://anexplorer.co</p><p>* Revenue - $50K/year (95% ▲)</p><p>* User growth: 130% ▲ yoy</p><p>* Active users: 350K</p><p>ACrypto - https://acrypto.io</p><p>* Revenue - $10K/year</p><p>* Active users: 30K</p><p>Tech Stack i used:
