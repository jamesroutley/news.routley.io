<p>Roll out the red carpet. Starting today, anyone in Los Angeles can take fully autonomous rides 24/7 with Waymo One – rolling through Santa Monica, Hollywood Boulevard, USC, and everything in between.</p>
<p>Waymo has enjoyed a warm welcome from Angelenos since we began commercial operations in LA earlier this year, with nearly 300,000 people joining our waitlist. We’ve opened our doors to those eager riders over time, who have taken hundreds of thousands of paid trips across the city and highly rated them at 4.7 / 5 stars on average. In fact, riders recently surveyed in LA said that 98% are satisfied with our service and 96% find it useful.</p>
<p>“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” said Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO, Waymo. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”</p>
<p>Riders can now traverse nearly 80 sq miles of LA County, and we intend to grow our service area to cover more of the city in the future. We look forward to welcoming many first-time riders and welcoming back those we’ve served over the last year, as we steadily scale our service over time just as we’ve done in San Francisco and Phoenix.</p>
<p><b>A service for everyone</b></p>
<p>Our LA riders have fully embraced the convenience and freedom of riding with Waymo One. With the Waymo Driver at the wheel, people are reclaiming their time in LA traffic to be more productive – or not – as they wish. Whether it’s taking extra time to run lines before an audition, filming social media videos, or simply taking a beat to relax, Angelenos are increasingly incorporating Waymo into their daily lives.</p>
<p>As we open our doors to more people, we’re working closely with local community partners aligned with our mission to make roads safer and mobility more accessible. For example, we’re proud to work with She is Hope, a nonprofit dedicated to empowering single mothers in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“Riding with Waymo was an incredible experience—smooth, safe, and truly impressive,” said Tisha Janigan, founder of She is Hope. “When I rode alone and with some of our single mother families, we were amazed by the driverless technology and the sense of comfort it provided. Access to Waymo could be a game-changer for women we serve, offering a nonjudgmental, reliable transportation option that prioritizes safety.”</p>

<p>Waymo’s also proud to serve as the Official Ride-Hail Partner of the <a href="https://laautoshow.com/">Los Angeles Auto Show</a>. If you’ll be in town and attending the show running November 22 - December 1, join us to learn more.</p>
<p>We’re eager for more people to experience the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. To ride in LA, SF, or Phoenix, simply download the <a href="https://waymo.com/waymo-one/">Waymo One</a> app and ride today.</p>
