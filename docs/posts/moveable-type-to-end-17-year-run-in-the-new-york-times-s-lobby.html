<p>“Moveable Type,” the public art installation in the New York Times’s lobby, is ending its 17-year run. The Times, which is replacing the exhibit as part of an update to its lobby, will share further details in the coming months. In the meantime, the artwork will remain on view and open to the public on weekdays in the lobby at 620 8th Avenue in Manhattan until mid-August.</p>
<p>Since its installation in 2007, the work has enthralled visitors with its dynamic portrayal of the rhythm of news and communication at The New York Times, blending art, technology, and journalism in an innovative visual narrative. Drawing on the latest content from the Times, the artwork collects and digests news stories, then visually reconstitutes them into constellations of words, phrases, and diagrams that dance across hundreds of small, low-tech screens accompanied by clicks, whirs, and tones.</p>
<p>“In ‘Moveable Type,’ Ben Rubin and Mark Hansen created a dramatic amalgam of technology, sound, and visuals to present a captivating display of content gleaned from our live, digital feed. Facing arrays of 560 charmingly lo-fi fluorescent screens present a dynamic flow of curated fragments from our content, recombined into animated word and image prose poems,” said Tom Bodkin, The New York Times’ former chief creative officer, who originally helped bring the project to the Times.</p>
<p>He continued: “All accompanied by the hypnotic sounds of the electro-mechanics driving the display. The installation exquisitely reflects the scale and transparency of Renzo Piano’s architecture, similarly exhibiting fine craftsmanship along with the integrity of exposed structure. And it delightfully reinterprets our digital content as we transition to new platforms. A reflection of our core values, and a perfect installation for its place and time.”</p>
<p><strong>An artwork for the changing Times</strong></p>
<p>The New York Times entered the 21st century poised to move from its gritty industrial 43rd street facility into a new glass tower two blocks south on Eighth Avenue. At the same time, new technologies had set the stage for the radical transformation of the whole media industry. This was the context in 2003, when The Times’s leadership asked statistician Mark Hansen and artist Ben Rubin to create “Moveable Type” as a bridge between the paper’s 150-year journalistic history and the as-yet uncharted landscape of digital news.</p>
<p><strong>Four months at folding tables in the lobby</strong></p>
<p>Before finalizing their design, Rubin and Hansen spent two years observing and interviewing the journalists, editors, designers, and production staff who perform the daily miracle of putting out an issue of The Times. Then in 2007, as Times employees began moving into their new building, the pair began an extraordinary 4-month residency period programming the artwork in the building’s lobby. “We would show up each morning with a folding table and chairs,” recalls Rubin. “With 560 screens arrayed on two opposing walls, we really needed to be right there.”</p>

<p>Working in such a public space had its challenges, says Hansen. “The place is full of curious reporters, and when they walked past us in the lobby with our laptops, they wanted to know what we were doing there. We loved talking with them.”</p>
<p>David Carr, the late media columnist for The Times, was one of those curious passersby. “You end up with a running narrative,” Carr told NPR’s Brooke Gladstone in a 2007 interview, observing that the artwork offered “bits which are stored and recalled in ones and zeroes by all of us later and assembled into some kind of comprehensible picture of the world that we live in, I think it’s a really great metaphor.”</p>
<p><strong>What’s the next move?</strong></p>
<p>After its removal, The New York Times plans to return “Moveable Type” to the artists. What happens next remains to be determined. “A lot of its meaning comes from its context inside the New York Times Building, so relocating it will be a challenge,” says Rubin.</p>
<p>“We don’t know where it’s going next, but whatever is ahead for the artwork, it has been a gratifying experience,” Hansen continued. “It was a once-in-a-lifetime project!”</p>
