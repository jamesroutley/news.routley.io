    <h1>Rails for Everything</h1>

      <h2>Rails for everything</h2>

      <p><em>Published: 2025-01-01</em></p>

      <p>
        After spending part of my holiday building and deploying a new Rails 8
        application, It&#39;s clearer than ever that Rails is awesome, and it&#39;s
        especially great for small projects with a single developer.
      </p>

      <h3>Guide is good</h3>

      <p>
        The latest
        <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#Rails-philosophy">Getting Started with Rails</a>
        guide is really excellent. There&#39;s a bit of hand waving around
        installing Ruby (which is still more difficult than it needs to be). But
        if you follow it start to finish, you&#39;ll have a Rails app
        <strong>in production</strong>. And it isn&#39;t just
        <code>hello world</code>. Your app will have authentication, caching,
        rich text, continuous integration, and a database. That&#39;s a real
        application.
      </p>

      <p>If you&#39;re brand new to Rails, the guide is the best place to start.</p>

      <h3>SQLite is all you need</h3>

      <p>
        SQlite is a great tool, but its focus on backwards compatibility means
        that it wasn&#39;t ideal for a production database out of the box. You
        <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/04/15/sqlite-on-Rails-the-how-and-why-of-optimal-performance/">had to add some gems</a>
        to get it ready to perform. However
        <a href="https://fractaledmind.github.io/2024/10/16/sqlite-supercharges-Rails/">Rails 8</a>
        deals with that for you, and SQLite is ready for production.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that you SQLite is a more robust choice, you don&#39;t have to worry
        about spinning up a PostgreSQL server. On top of that, with tools like
        <a href="https://dev.37signals.com/solid-cache/">solid cache</a> you
        don&#39;t need to stand up redis either.
      </p>

      <p>Everything is running under Rails and within SQLite. Superb.</p>

      <h3>Easy CI</h3>

      <p>
        After I pushed my initial Rails commit, I got an unexpected email:
        <code>Run failed: CI - main</code>. My first thought was actually a
        malicious actor, but I was wrong.
        <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#continuous-integration-with-github-actions">Rails 8 comes with basic CI config</a>
        and
        <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-your-products/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions">Github comes with 2000 free minutes per month</a>
        of actions usage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from it being really cool to have CI with no effort, 2000 minutes
        of run time is a lot for solo developer!
      </p>

      <h3>Authentication generator</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/heartcombo/devise">Devise</a> is the
        canonical authentication gem. But it hides a lot of complexity and it&#39;s
        not exactly easy to configure correctly, especially for a beginner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rails 8 adds a new authentication generator. It add a simple sign in
        flow for existing users. All you need to do is add a user via the Rails
        console and boom. You can log in.
      </p>

      <p>The generated code is pretty minimal and easy to read about.</p>

      <h3>Easy and fast deploys with Kamal</h3>

      <p>
        I am more than happy to leave deploys to my very smart friends in the
        ops team. To deploy a new Rails 8 app, I just needed to update a few
        items in <code>deploy.yml</code>, follow a few directions, and I had an
        app live! With SSL!
      </p>

      <p>
        Honestly it took less time to get a web app up than it took me to get
        SSL on a Github page.
      </p>

      <p>
        CI + easy deploys might be the best part about Rails 8. Even just using
        the getting started guide, it encourages best practices.
      </p>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>

      <p>
        <a href="https://israilsdead.com/">Rails is not dead</a>; It&#39;s better
        than ever. Try using it to make something new this year.
