						Timelinize <span>(&#34;time-lynn-eyes&#34;)</span> is an open source personal archival suite, designed for modern family history. It organizes all your data onto a single, unified timeline on your own computer.

				<h2>A place for everything...</h2>
				<p>
					Photos, videos, text messages, locations, chats, social media, and more. Timelinize unifies it all.
				</p>
				<p>
					By adding all your data, Timelinize documents your family&#39;s life with more detail and privacy, and gives you a more complete view of your story, than standard photo library and journaling apps.
				</p>

				

				<h2>...and everything at home.</h2>
				<p>
					Most apps store your data &#34;in the cloud&#34; and <i>out of your control</i>. What if you lost access to your Google/Apple/Facebook accounts, or your phone? By bringing that data home to your own computer, Timelinize preserves a richer story than any one app or service can do alone.
				</p>
				<p>
					Timelinize isn&#39;t a replacement for the apps and services you already use, so you don&#39;t need to disrupt your way of life. Instead, it &#34;sits behind&#34; what you already use to become the permanent private archive of your working copy from:

					<h2>The ultimate personal archival suite</h2>

					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Flexible, high-speed imports</h3>
							<p>
								Add millions of data points to your timeline in a matter of minutes. You get full control over background jobs like imports, thumbnails, and embeddings.
							</p>

							<h3>Pictures come alive with motion</h3>
							<p>
								Timelinize supports playing &#34;live photos&#34; (or &#34;motion photos&#34;) for photos taken on Apple, Google, and Samsung devices.
							</p>
						</div>
						<p>
							<figure>

					</div>

						<div>
							<h3>Entity-aware processing</h3>
							<p>
								Timelinize specializes in combining data from multiple sets and sources. It can identify people and other entities across data sources by their attributes. If a person or contact appears in multiple data sets, it will automatically merge them if possible. If not, you can easily merge entities with the click of a button.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>

								<a href="https://lucymcphail.com/resources/images/merge-entities.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://lucymcphail.com/resources/images/merge-entities.jpg"/></a>
								<figcaption>Manually merge duplicate people/contacts in your timeline for optimal comprehension.</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Magically geo-locate data without coordinates</h3>
							<p>
								Because Timelinize is entity-aware, it can project data points onto a map even without coordinate data. If a geolocated point is known for an entity around the same time of others of that entity&#39;s data points, it will appear on the map.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>

								<figcaption>This message from social media has no geocoordinates, but we can still see it on the map when and where it was received.</figcaption>
							</figure>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Make your map pop</h3>
							<p>
								Customize the map to change its theme, layers, and even make it 3D.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<figure>
								<a href="https://lucymcphail.com/resources/images/map-3d.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://lucymcphail.com/resources/images/map-3d.jpg"/></a>

							<h3>See your hot spots at a glance</h3>
							<p>
								The heatmap shows where your data is concentrated. It smoothly blends as you zoom in and out.

							<h3>Combine data sets</h3>
							<p>
								Customize what defines a duplicate item, and how to handle that, with a fine degree of control—perfect for merging separate, disparate data sets.
							</p>
						</div>

								<a href="https://lucymcphail.com/resources/images/import-settings.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://lucymcphail.com/resources/images/import-settings.jpg"/></a>

							</figure>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Unified conversations</h3>
							<p>
								An implicit conversation is discovered when a data source links items and entities with a &#34;sent to&#34; relation. You can easily view conversations between entities across modalities in a single scroll: chats, emails, messages, texts, and more.

					<h2>Features for humans</h2>

					<p>Since I need this to function well for my own family, I have tried to give special attention to less-visible aspects of this application, such as:</p>

					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Advanced location processor</h3>
							<p>
								Timelinize deduplicates, denoises, clusters, and simplifies location data for optimal preservation, with an algorithm that subjectively performs better than Google Maps Timeline.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>CLI and HTTP API</h3>
							<p>
								For nerds like me: you can use Timelinize through its CLI, which mirrors all the functions of the HTTP API used by the frontend.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Semantic search</h3>
							<p>
								Search for pictures and messages by describing them, or find similar items to what you&#39;re viewing.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Thumbnails and transcoding</h3>
							<p>
								All items are stored verbatim, then thumbnails are generated for all images and video media, which are stored separately. Your original data is not modified.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Flexible schema</h3>
							<p>
								The database schema has been meticulously designed and refined to be as adaptable as possible.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h2>A timeline to the future</h2>

					<p>Timelinize will continue to develop and evolve. In the future, I anticipate the following capabilities:</p>

					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Create using your timeline</h3>
							<p>
								Annotate your timeline, write rich stories with live embeddings from your timeline data, or make physical media like photo books (but with more than just photos!).
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Augment with public data</h3>
							<p>
								Add context to your timeline with additional public timelines which have weather, local/regional news, and global events.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Secure data sharing</h3>
							<p>
								Securely and privately share parts of your timeline with trusted friends and family members, directly from your computer to theirs.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Mobile apps and first-class sync</h3>
							<p>
								Right now, Timelinize sits &#34;behind&#34; the apps and platforms you already use. But in the future, you could sync data directly to your timeline as it is originated.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<h2>Meet your personal timeline</h2>

					<p>Collect your data from <a href="https://lucymcphail.com/docs/data-preparation#data-sources">various sources</a>. Import it with a few clicks. Within minutes, explore millions of your data points in several intuitive ways.</p>

					<div>
						<div>
							<h3>Self-contained, portable repositories</h3>
							<p>
								Imported data is copied into your timeline folder, ensuring long-term stability and integrity. Timelines are portable—you can copy them or move them to other devices and computers.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>No proprietary storage scheme</h3>
							<p>
								Your timeline is simply a folder on disk containing a SQLite database alongside your data files. You can freely explore it with other tooling, so you&#39;re not locked into Timelinize.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<h3>Works with data you&#39;re already generating</h3>
							<p>
								Unlike writing a journal, you don&#39;t have to take extra time to create content. You&#39;re already making the data your timeline can display! And it doesn&#39;t replace your current workflow or apps.
							</p>
