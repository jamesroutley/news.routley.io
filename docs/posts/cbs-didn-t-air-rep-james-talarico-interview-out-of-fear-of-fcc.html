    <h1>CBS didn&#39;t air Rep. James Talarico interview out of fear of FCC</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="anchor-a55585">&#34;Late Show&#34; host Stephen Colbert said CBS did not air his Monday  interview with Senate candidate Rep. James Talarico, D-Texas, out of fear of the Federal Communications Commission. </p><p id="anchor-ae5908">Colbert kicked off Monday night&#39;s show by almost immediately mentioning Talarico&#39;s absence. </p><p id="anchor-ee94f5">&#34;He was supposed to be here, but we were told in no uncertain terms by our network&#39;s lawyers, who called us directly, that we could not have him on the broadcast,&#34; Colbert said. &#34;Then, then I was told in some uncertain terms that not only could I not have him on, I could not mention me not having him on. And because my network clearly doesn&#39;t want us to talk about this, let&#39;s talk about this.&#34; </p><p id="anchor-8c5e89">CBS and the FCC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p><section id="anchor-3d6e17" data-testid="embed-widget"></section><p id="anchor-d397a6">“The Late Show” published the unaired interview with Talarico on YouTube. In the interview, Colbert and Talarico discuss the FCC crackdown, including opening a probe into ABC’s “The View,” after Talarico appeared on the show. </p><p id="anchor-779db5">“I think that Donald Trump is worried that we’re about to flip Texas,” Talarico said, which was met with audience applause. “This is the party that ran against cancel culture, and now they’re trying to control what we watch, what we say, what we read. And this is the most dangerous kind of cancel culture, the kind that comes from the top.”</p><p id="anchor-3be595">Talarico accused the Trump administration of “selling out the First Amendment to curry favor with corrupt politicians.”</p><p id="anchor-171594">“A threat to any of our First Amendment rights is a threat to all of our First Amendment rights.” </p><p id="anchor-5fc80a">CBS&#39; move to not air the segment comes as the FCC, the government&#39;s media regulator, and most notably its chairman, Brendan Carr, have been particularly combative with networks that have drawn the ire of the president. </p><p id="anchor-df8614">Trump has for months suggested the FCC could <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-fcc-revoke-tv-broadcast-licenses-over-bad-publicity-rcna232339" target="_blank">revoke the licenses of television broadcasters</a>. More recently, Carr, who was appointed by Trump to lead the FCC, has said that daytime and late-night TV talk shows <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/fcc-late-night-daytime-talk-shows-equal-time-candidate-interviews-rcna255315" target="_blank">must comply with the equal time rule regarding political candidates</a>.</p><p id="anchor-f7fbb1">The FCC&#39;s equal time rule prohibits radio and broadcast channels from hosting political candidates during an election without giving airtime to their opponents. During his show Monday, Colbert highlighted that news interviews and talk show interviews with politicians are exceptions.</p><p id="anchor-02f102">On Jan. 21, Carr released a letter warning networks about the rule, saying that he is considering eliminating exceptions due to the networks&#39; potential partisan motivations. </p><p id="anchor-2a59d8">Colbert fired back at Carr on Monday, accusing the chairman of being motivated by partisan purposes. </p><p id="anchor-4f84ca">&#34;Let&#39;s just call this what it is: Donald Trump&#39;s administration wants to silence anyone who says anything bad about Trump on TV because all Trump does is watch TV,&#34; Colbert joked. </p><p id="anchor-7d8def">This comes months after <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/tv/disneys-abc-pulls-jimmy-kimmel-live-fcc-chair-blasts-hosts-charlie-kir-rcna232033" target="_blank">ABC pulled “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” off the air &#34;indefinitely&#34;</a> after Carr criticized comments the host made about the assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk. </p><p id="anchor-941736">Kimmel accused &#34;the MAGA Gang&#34; of trying to &#34;score political points&#34; by characterizing the suspect &#34;as anything other than one of them.&#34;</p><p id="anchor-c2f2f0">Kimmel&#39;s show was pulled a couple of days later and returned to the air after about a week. </p></div><div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/mirna-alsharif-ncpn1297517" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture" data-flavor="focal" data-original-height="48" data-original-width="48"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2022_46/3581066/mirna-alsharif-byline-jm.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_46/3581066/mirna-alsharif-byline-jm.jpg 1x"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_46/3581066/mirna-alsharif-byline-jm.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"/></picture></a></div><p>Mirna Alsharif is a breaking news reporter for NBC News.</p></div><div><p>Austin Mullen</p><!-- --><p> and </p><!-- --><p>Allie Canal</p><!-- --> <!-- --><p>contributed</p><!-- --><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>
