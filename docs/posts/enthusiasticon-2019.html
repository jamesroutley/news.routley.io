    <h1>EnthusiastiCon 2019</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I’ve got great news for all of you: <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Enthusiasticon.html">EnthusiastiCon</a> is back in 2019! <a href="https://www.enthusiasticon.de/">The website</a> is looking sharper than ever and <a href="https://www.enthusiasticon.de/cfp/">the CFP</a> is open for another two weeks, what more can you ask for?</p>
<p>But before we get ahead of ourselves, a few bits of information for those of you that don’t know EnthusiastiCon yet: EnthusiastiCon is a two-day, single-track conference in Berlin. Its core idea is based on <a href="http://bangbangcon.com/">!!con</a>, which means that talks will only be around 10 minutes long, and about a topic that really excites the speaker. We’ve had talks about topics as diverse as spreadsheets, type systems, LED clothing, machine learning, and self care!</p>
<p>Thanks as always to our sponsors, <a href="https://port-zero.com">Port Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">the Recurse Center</a>, and to our hosts, <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/">ThoughtWorks</a> and <a href="http://co-up.de/">Co-Up</a>!</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
