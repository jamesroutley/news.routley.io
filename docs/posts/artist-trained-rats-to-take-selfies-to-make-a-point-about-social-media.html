They perform for the camera,&#34; he said. &#34;They look cute.&#34;</p><p>The installation is from 2021, but has been the focus of renewed attention after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/science/photography-rats-selfies.html">being featured in the New York Times</a> this week.<strong> </strong></p><p>He built his own version of a Skinner box, a device designed by behavioural scientist B.F. Skinner to conduct learning experiments on rats. </p><p>In the original Skinner box experiments, rats would push a lever to dispense food pellets. In Lignier&#39;s box, when Arthur and Augustin pushed the lever, a camera would snap their picture and display it on a screen in front of them. </p><p>At first, he says, pushing the lever also dispensed a piece of sugar, rewarding selfies with sweets. </p><p>&#34;Then they start to associate, like, an action to pleasure,&#34; Lignier said. &#34;And they start to play more and more with it.&#34;</p><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="On the left, a brown mouse peers out from the corner and looks at the camera while pushing down on a plastic lever with one little pink paw.

At first, he says, humans are incentivized by measurable rewards — namely likes or other engagements on posts.</p><p>But social media can be fickle, and those rewards are intermittent at best. Many behavioural experts and researchers have said that what really keeps people scrolling and posting is dopamine. </p><p>Dopamine is a chemical produced in the brain when we do something pleasurable, like eating, exercising and having sex. It motivates us to continue that pleasurable behaviour, which is why it&#39;s also connected with addiction. </p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2021/aug/22/how-digital-media-turned-us-all-into-dopamine-addicts-and-what-we-can-do-to-break-the-cycle"><u>In an interview with the Guardian</u></a>, addictions expert Anna Lembke, author of <em>Dopamine Nation</em>, called the smartphone a &#34;modern-day hypodermic needle.&#34;</p><p>But while Lignier says <em>Selfie Rats </em>is meant to make us think about what drives our behaviours online, it&#39;s not necessarily a scathing critique of internet culture.</p><p>&#34;Big tech companies design our behaviour,&#34; he said. &#34;But we can still have fun and enjoy it.&#34;</p><p>Arthur and Augustin produced dozens upon dozens of selfies, trying out different angles like real social media pros. But Lignier says they didn&#39;t seem to get any fulfilment from the images themselves.</p><p>&#34;I try to show them the images on the screen, so directly after they took the picture, they can see their own selfie,&#34; he said. &#34;But they don&#39;t recognize themselves, you know.&#34;</p><p>When his beloved collaborators were finished with their modelling job, he says he sent them to his mother&#39;s house in southern France to live out the rest of their short lives in peace and comfort.</p><p>They have since died, he says, and are buried in his mother&#39;s garden, side-by-side.</p><div><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Side-by-side images of rats looking at the camera while pushing down on a small plastic lever." srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7093928.1706138854!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/rat-selfies.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7093928.1706138854!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/rat-selfies.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7093928.1706138854!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/rat-selfies.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7093928.1706138854!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rat-selfies.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.7093928.1706138854!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/rat-selfies.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.7093928.1706138854!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/rat-selfies.jpg"/></p><figcaption>Lignier says he saw the rats as his &#39;collaborators&#39; and &#39;performers.&#39;<!-- --> <!-- -->(Augustin Lignier/augustinlignier.com)</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Interview with Augustin Lignier produced by Kate Swoger</p></div></div></div>
