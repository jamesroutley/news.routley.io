    <h1>Novels should not have blurbs on the back</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>Admire the following opening sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High, high above the North Pole, on the first day of 1969, two professors of English Literature approached each other at a combined velocity of 1200 miles per hour.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus begins the novel <em>Changing Places,</em> by David Lodge. </p>
<p>Isn&#39;t it a great first sentence? Don&#39;t you want to know what the second sentence says?</p>
<p>The best openings of books act like an attack of chloroform. They immediately dose the reader with the atmosphere of the book. </p>
<p>But you know what ruins the effectiveness of a chloroform attack? Advance warning. </p>
<p>All too often, that warning comes from the book itself. An innocent reader, intrigued by a title or a cover, flips the book to the back, and starts to read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Euphoric State University with it&#39;s whitestone, sun-drenched campus and England&#39;s damp red-brick University of Rummidge have an annual professor exchange schemeâ€”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stop! Stop! I don&#39;t want to know about that exchange program! The author hasn&#39;t decided I need to know it yet. That&#39;s a whole five pages of elegant prose dented by a premature disclosure on the part of the marketer. And that&#39;s just the first sentence: if I dare to read on, I might know the plot of the first third of the book before I&#39;ve even opened the first page.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, these blurbs wouldn&#39;t exist. Every reader could have the privilege of diving into a novel with the first sentence, blissfully unaware of what lies ahead.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I have three main gripes with blurbs on novels.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>The first is the one I cited above: the back of the book spoils the book&#39;s introduction. (If you&#39;re lucky! Sometimes the blurb spoils the whole ending, as when an edition of classic book raves of &#34;strong characterization, from the atmospheric beginnings to the tragic ending.&#34;)</p>
<p>The second gripe is more subtle: blurbs change my relationship to the book.</p>
<p>Have you ever been to an art museum which only gives the title of each artwork? Every time I go to a museum without labels, I find myself much more engaged by the artwork. I have no answer key to the painting in front of me; only I can notice the details the painter left on the canvas.</p>
<p>Similarly, reading a book without a description is like walking through a forest without a map. I must explore the space around me, and slowly sink into the environment. Having a book description is like having a satellite photo of the forest: it might help me orient quicker, but also, it makes me judge everything I read in relation to what I know is coming.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Third, I think blurbs unfairly hurt good books that sound boring.</p>
<p>A good blurb exists to convince readers to buy the book, usually by sharing the novel&#39;s premise. A novel with a strong premise is going to sell better, so authors are incentivized to write with intriguing premises.</p>
<p>A good premise isn&#39;t a bad thing in itself, but not all good books have compelling premises. Take <em>War and Peace.</em> What&#39;s it about? Well, a bunch of Russian aristocrats navigate War ... and Peace. I&#39;m sure someone more clever than I could find a good hook, but the book&#39;s form does not lend itself well to pithy summarization. (I&#39;m sure almost every description today would sell it is as a Tolstoy masterpiece, instead of on the plot). </p>
<p>Regardless, <em>War and Peace</em> is a great book, and well worth a read. A world with blurbs disadvantages books that defy easy summing up, or which situate themselves in the most pedestrian of circumstances. Can&#39;t we let each book speak for itself?</p>
<p>Not really, I admit. We still have to choose which books to read. If not blurbs, then what?</p>
<p>I usually read the books that come into my life, either by gift or happenstance. That way, I can worry less about whether I&#39;m initially attracted to any given book, and more whether I enjoy it in the moment. </p>
<p>That&#39;s not a perfect system; I realize it doesn&#39;t work for everyone. Still, I think there are plenty of ways to choose what to read that don&#39;t rely on having two to four paragraphs of summary before you open the first page.</p>
<p>Like reading a blog post that tangentially mentions a book called <em>Changing Places</em> and deciding to read it yourself.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p>
<p><em>Author&#39;s note: I wrote this quickly, and it&#39;s probably all wrong. Let me know how I messed up in the comments, or by emailing me at kai [at] liquidbrain [dot] net.</em></p>
