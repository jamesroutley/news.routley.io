      <p><span>Imagine a smart watch, but from 1984. That sounds like something straight out of a scifi film since the 80s is not exactly known for great advances in personal computing. Well, it’s real, and it is exactly what Seiko created back in the day and was known as the UC-2000 - a “personal information processor” that you can wear on your wrist. As you would expect, it was a novel device that was released for $300, or almost $700 adjusted for inflation.</span></p>

<p><span>It looks like a computer and almost worked like one too, although it can’t technically be called a computer until you dock it on an external keyboard that adds actual computer-like functionalities. </span></p>
<p><span>For the gamers reading, this watch is obviously incapable of running </span><i><span>Crysis. </span></i><span>But what can it do and how did it come to be? Read on to find out.</span></p>

<h2><span>Why Make a Wrist Computer</span></h2>
<p><span>During the dawn of the computing age, western companies focused on making their hardware more powerful and more complex. This is how you got massive computers - it didn’t matter how big a computer became as long as it was more powerful than the last.</span></p>

<p><span>On the other hand, Eastern companies, particularly Japanese ones, focused on making computers smaller and lighter while sacrificing functionality. This is how we got to the Seiko UC-2000: a watch with data entry, translation, and calculation functions that you can wear on your wrist.</span></p>
<p><span>The Seiko smart watch was undoubtedly state of the art technology when it was released, but was there even a demand for such a device?</span></p>

<p><span>Look at this marvel! </span><span>Source: <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/11/14/80s-smartwatch-finally-plays-tetris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hackaday</a></span></p>

<p><span>Seiko marketed it to people who already owned computers. Since you can’t bring your computer with you, this device can be your mini-computer for the day while you’re out and about, which can connect and transmit data to your home computer. It sold well for the first few months, but 2 years later and the UC-2000 was already in the bargain bin, with entire watch + dock bundles selling for 1/3rd of its original price.</span></p>
