    <h1>Not even LinkedIn is that keen on Microsoft&#39;s cloud: Shift to Azure abandoned</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>LinkedIn has abandoned its efforts to migrate its datacenter infrastructure to Microsoft Azure four years after announcing the planned move.</p>
<p>Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNBC <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/14/linkedin-shelved-plan-to-migrate-to-microsoft-azure-cloud.html">reports</a> the effort, codenamed &#34;Blueshift,&#34; had run up against numerous challenges in the years since Microsoft acquired the professional networking site in 2016 for $27 billion.</p>
<p>In a statement to <em>The Register</em>, LinkedIn confirmed its plans to invest in its own datacenters while using Azure services where appropriate.</p>

    

<p>&#34;This includes our running 100 employee-facing applications on Azure, leveraging Azure FrontDoor and ongoing work to consolidate our datacenter locations that are currently spread across multiple buildings under a single roof,&#34; the spokesperson said. &#34;Azure has been crucial to support and scale collaboration and productivity for our teams to deliver value to our members.&#34;</p>

        


        

<p>The decision marks a reversal of LinkedIn&#39;s plans, <a target="_blank" href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2019/building-next-infra">announced</a> in a 2019 blog post, to migrate its workloads to a public cloud. At the time Mohak Shroff, the social network&#39;s SVP of engineering, touted the move as an opportunity to better support the site&#39;s growing membership.</p>
<p>&#34;With the incredible member and business growth we&#39;re seeing, we&#39;ve decided to begin a multi-year migration of all LinkedIn workloads to the public cloud,&#34; he wrote. &#34;Moving to Azure will give us access to a wide array of hardware and software innovations, and unprecedented global scale.&#34;</p>

<p>Over the past few years LinkedIn has deployed some services in Azure. In early 2022, the social network <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2022/accelerating-the-linkedin-experience-with-azure-front-door">tapped up</a> Azure FrontDoor, Microsoft&#39;s content delivery network, which caches commonly accessed content across a global network of edge datacenters reducing the bandwidth and access latencies required to serve users.</p>
<p>However, by mid-2022, CNBC reports, the cracks in LinkedIn&#39;s migration strategy were beginning to show. In a memo last summer, LinkedIn CTO Raghu Hiremagalur reportedly told employees LinkedIn was moving to a hybrid-cloud model with some services running in the cloud and others in the company&#39;s dedicated datacenters.</p>

        

<p>As it turned out, while Azure&#39;s scale may have presented a tantalizing opportunity at first blush, LinkedIn was having a hard time taking advantage of the cloud provider&#39;s software. Sources told CNBC that issues arose when LinkedIn attempted to lift and shift its existing software tools to Azure rather than refactor them to run on the cloud provider&#39;s ready made tools.
