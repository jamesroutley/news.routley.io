<p>Defending your right to modify and repair the software on your electronics has been a cornerstone of Software Freedom Conservancy since its inception.  We defend these rights in a variety of ways: <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2021/oct/28/2021-DMCA-final-exemptions-win/">petitioning the Copyright Office to return our repair and modification rights</a>, investigating <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/help.html">reports people send us where companies are using our member projects&#39; code but aren&#39;t providing the source or repair and modification information that the project&#39;s license requires</a>, <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2019/oct/02/cambium-ubiquiti-gpl-violations/">contacting those companies to remind them of the license requirements</a>, and (eventually, in rare cases after companies ignore our gentle reminders for many months) <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/vizio">filing lawsuits against intransigent companies who refuse to give you the complete source and instructions you deserve</a> (and that they are required to provide by the licenses of the software they freely choose to use).</p>

<p>In the rare cases where Software Freedom Conservancy has been forced to move its enforcement actions from gentle reminders to filing lawsuits, we have used a variety of approaches.  Our lawsuit filed in 2007 against several manufacturers, used copyright law (specifically copyrights in the BusyBox project) to compel those manufacturers to comply with the GPL (<a href="https://sfconservancy.org/news/2010/aug/03/busybox-gpl/">such as Westinghouse</a>).  The lawsuit we filed last year <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/vizio">against Vizio</a> takes an approach more appropriate for widely marketed and available consumer devices.  Namely, the claim in Vizio is a contract claim for third-party beneficiary rights under the GPL, which will allow us (and all other customers who bought Vizio TV&#39;s) to receive the repair and modification instructions to the software more directly.</p>

<p>Since we began enforcing the GPL fifteen years ago, the landscape of GPL violations has deteriorated: GPL&#39;d software now appears in nearly every consumer device smarter than a toaster, and very rarely do the manufacturers even bother to offer source code to users â€” and almost never does the source release meet the requirements of the GPL.  As a result, we at Software Freedom Conservancy continue to dedicate more time and resources to our enforcement efforts.  We seek to ensure that the situation does not get even worse, and we believe that we can improve the situation even more.</p>

<p>The best approach, in our view, is to continue to bring a variety of different types of actions against intransigent violators.  As always, we use litigation and litigation-like means 
as a last resort, but we&#39;ve reached that point with dozens of companies.  There are a variety of types of actions we could take and lawsuits that we could bring, and different ways we can go about preparing for them.  But, to have the full scope of options, we need your help.</p>

<p>As a contributor to copyleft projects, one way that you can help us <strong>right now</strong> is to assign the copyrights of your software freedom works to Software Freedom Conservancy.  As the Vizio suit shows, copyright-based claims will not be the sole focus of our enforcement.  However, there are some key types of products where
copyright claims are ideal.  By assigning your copyrights to us, you can give us the ability to stand up for your software freedom and rights and, more importantly, the rights of your users.  While we understand the FOSS community has some aversions to copyright assignment, we also know that, right now, many developers automatically assign their copyrights to their employers without demanding that their employers stand up for the copyleft rights of their users.  We ask the community to reconsider this common practice, and request
those who haven&#39;t already assigned copyright to their employer to assign their copyrights to us, and we urge those who have entered work-for-hire arrangements with employers ask
those employers to give them back their copyrights immediately.  (See our <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/contractpatch/">ContractPatch</a> project for more information on how to do this.)</p>

<p>Today, we launch our self-service <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/assignment/">Copyright Assignment form</a>.  This new form, carefully vetted by our lawyers, allows you to quickly and easily assign your rights in your code, documentation, and other copyrightable works to Software Freedom Conservancy.  We will use these copyrights to ensure companies follow the copyleft licenses that they use.  You can assign copyrights for projects that are not members of Software Freedom Conservancy too.  We will always enforce them in accordance with <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/copyleft-compliance/principles.html">our Principles</a>, and we will welcome you onto an internal mailing list and regular
meetings to discuss our enforcement efforts.</p>

<p>Through the various software freedom lawsuits we have filed over the years, along with the lawsuits we&#39;ve helped fund, Software Freedom Conservancy has established a track record of tangible enforcement actions. </p>

<p>We are very happy for all the support we&#39;ve received from software freedom activists, developers, and other community members over the years in our software freedom enforcement actions.  We hope you will continue to support us, and encourage others to do so, in <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/donate/">whatever ways you can</a> and, if it makes sense for you, by <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/assignment/">assigning your software freedom works to us</a> so we can ensure the repairability of your electronics (and everyone else&#39;s!) going forward.</p>
