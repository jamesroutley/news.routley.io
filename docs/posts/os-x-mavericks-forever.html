				<h4>In the fall of 2019, I came to a decision. It was time to leave modern macOS behind.</h4>
				<hr/>
				<p><span>A</span> <span>decade prior, switching to OS X had been a revelatory experience, as though the software was working in perfect sync with my mind. That feeling had long since disappeared. Each update seemed to chip away at something I liked about the platform. I needed to switch to a different operating system.</span></p>
				<p>I surveyed the computing landscape. Windows was still fine, and Linux was still Linux. A normal person would have just picked one—but I was apparently not a normal person. I cared far too much about having the <em>perfect</em> computer, and I just couldn&#39;t get that wonderful memory out of my head...</p>
				<p>What follows is partly my journey, and partly a guide for anyone who wants to follow in my footsteps. I don&#39;t know whether I <em>recommend</em> following in my footsteps, because it does take some work, but the results can be wonderful. If you&#39;re ready, here&#39;s how to do it.</p>

				<h3>Macintosh</h3>
				<p>Every Mac released between October 2008 and September 2014 is capable of running Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks. Maybe a friend has something in their closet?</p>
				<p>Some notable models include:</p>
				<h4>Cylindrical &#34;Trash Can&#34; Mac Pro</h4>
				<p>If you don&#39;t need portability, the 2013 Mac Pro&#39;s Xeon processors and dual AMD FirePro GPUs remain extremely powerful in 2025!</p>
				<h4>Mid-2014 11&#34; Macbook Air</h4>
				<p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, the tiny 11&#34; Macbook Air will not win any awards for speed, but it is super easy to pick up and carry around. Apple doesn&#39;t make computers this small anymore.</p>
				<p>This is the laptop I use as a secondary computer while travelling. Make sure to find one with 8 GB of memory!</p>
				<h4>Mid-2014 Retina Macbook Pro</h4>
				<p>If you want something portable but a bit more capable than a Macbook Air, these will run Mavericks beautifully. Beware: you are looking for the model originally released in July of 2014. The &#34;Late 2014&#34; models released the following October do not support Mavericks.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Whatever computer you choose, consider getting the battery replaced if it&#39;s a laptop. You may need to find a repair shop.</p>
				
				<h3>Hackintosh</h3>
				<p>For myself, I built a Hackintosh to serve as my primary workstation. I wanted a system that would be old enough to run Mavericks, but powerful enough that I would never notice its age. Five years in to the experiment, this machine is still much more than sufficiently fast.</p>
				<p>My hardware:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Intel i7 4790K @ 4 GHz</li>
					<li>nVidia GeForce GTX 780 Ti</li>
					<li>Samsung 870 EVO SATA III SSD</li>
					<li>32 GB DDR3 Memory</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The primary limitations are as follows:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>CPU</strong>: Haswell or older.</li>
					<li><strong>GPU</strong>: For nVidia, Kepler or older. For AMD, GCN 1.0 or older.</li>
					<li><strong>Storage</strong>: SATA III. No NVMe drives!</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Full Hackintosh instructions are beyond the scope of this website. However, I&#39;ve put together a <a href="https://github.com/Wowfunhappy/Mavericks-Hackintosh-Collection/releases/download/2025.08.02/Mavericks.Hackintosh.Collection.zip">collection of tools and minimal guide</a> which may work for you, depending on your hardware. This collection is based around the older Clover bootloader, because that&#39;s what I use on my own system.</p>
				<p>Alternately, you can use the modern OpenCore bootloader. <a href="https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/" target="_blank">Dortania&#39;s OpenCore Install Guide</a> is very comprehensive and includes information for older operating systems such as Mavericks.</p>

				<h2 id="why-mavericks">Why Mavericks, specifically?</h2>
				<p><span>O</span><span>nce I had decided to try downgrading my computing life, I needed a single version to settle on. I knew I wanted an operating system from before Apple abandoned the Aqua design language. I find that the classic design&#39;s strong sense of depth and rich color contrast makes my computer a lot more pleasant to use. And for reasons I can&#39;t explain, it also makes window management in particular a lot easier for me.</span></p>
				<p>I experimented with three candidates inside Virtual Machines: OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, and OS X 10.9 Mavericks. Mountain Lion was quickly eliminated:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Speed</strong>. Mountain Lion was noticably slower than Mavericks on the same hardware, particularly in memory-constrained environments. Mavericks supports memory compression, and it makes a big difference! </li>
				<li><strong>Aesthetics</strong>. Mountain Lion borrows many visual elements from early iOS, such as its linen-clad Notification Center and leather-bound Contacts app. I wanted a computer, not an iPhone. The Contacts app in Mavericks is actually closer to the one in Snow Leopard.</li>
				<li><strong>App Compatibility</strong>. Mavericks supports more recent versions of apps like Affinity Photo and VMWare Fusion. iMessage works on Mavericks, as does Zoom. By contrast, I&#39;m not aware of any software that works on Mountain Lion but not Mavericks.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Mountain Lion does have a more capable version of QuickTime, which I ultimately brought over to Mavericks. More on that later.</p>
				<p>Choosing between Mavericks and Snow Leopard was more difficult. Snow Leopard has achieved something of a legendary status in the collective memory of many tech enthusiasts, and it&#39;s an operating system I have personal nostalgia for. Snow Leopard also supports Rosetta, potentially opening up a new library of classic PowerPC apps. However:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Aesthetics</strong>. For the most part, I find Mavericks more visually appealing than Snow Leopard. Both versions share the same broad design language, but Apple made a lot of clever refinements between 2009 and 2013. Snow Leopard does have three visual elements which I unambiguously prefer: the scroll bars, the larger &#34;traffic light&#34; window control buttons, and the darker window chrome. I eventually modded the latter two into Mavericks; Snow Leopard&#39;s scroll bars are alas still stuck in Snow Leopard.</li>
				<li><strong>Missing Features</strong>. In Snow Leopard, you can&#39;t rename the current document from the title bar, or reopen recent documents from the Dock menu. Snow Leopard can&#39;t use emojis—it doesn&#39;t support colored fonts—and its Finder has no concept of multiple tabs. Snow Leopard also lacks autosaving and full screen, and although these features were controversial when they were first introduced, I really appreciate their Mavericks incarnations.</li>
				<li><strong>Web Browsers</strong>. There is no modern mainstream browser engine that works in Snow Leopard.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I do prefer many of Snow Leopard&#39;s default settings, but these can be recreated in Mavericks with a simple post-install script.</p>
				<p>Mavericks it is.</p>

				<h2 id="obtaining">Obtaining Mavericks</h2>
				<p>For some inexplicable reason, Apple&#39;s website does not offer a Mavericks download link. Their <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102662#browser" target="_blank">official list</a> skips straight from Mountain Lion (10.8) to Yosemite (10.10). Perhaps Apple knows that Mavericks is just too good?</p>
				<p>No matter. We can download Mavericks from Apple&#39;s OS Recovery Server. Open the Terminal app on any Mac (press ⌘-space and search for &#34;Terminal&#34;), then type or paste in the following and press return:</p>
				<blockquote>curl mavericksforever.com/get.sh | sh</blockquote>
				<p>If you&#39;re familiar with shell scripts, you may want to read the script before running it. </p>
				<p>A Mavericks DMG image will be downloaded to your current working directory. If you can&#39;t find it, it may be in your home folder. A second file, &#34;create-bootable-installer.command&#34;, will also be created alongside the DMG. To create a bootable Mavericks USB installer, insert a USB drive and open this second file.</p>
				<p>You may already know how to do the rest. Insert the USB drive into a Mavericks-compatible Mac. Turn off the Mac, then turn it on with the option key held down. When asked to select a disk, choose the USB drive.</p>
			</div>

		<div data-on-screen-threshold="20%">

				<h2 id="setup">Initial Setup</h2>
				<p>Whenever I&#39;ve finished installing Mavericks, the first thing I do is open Terminal and run:
				</p><blockquote>curl mavericksforever.com/postinstall.sh | sh</blockquote>
				<p>This script will</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Update Mavericks to the latest version available.</li>
				<li>Change some default settings to resemble Snow Leopard.</li>
				<li>Remove apps and features which don&#39;t work anymore, and would just make me sad if I saw them.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The result of this script represents how I want to be greeted by a fresh Mavericks system.</p>
				
				<h3>Internet</h3>
				
				<h4>Web Browsing</h4>
				<p>We need a modern web browser! Luckily, the incredible i3roly has us covered with Firefox Dynasty, a fully up-to-date version of Firefox modified to work on old versions of OS X. It works just like mainline Firefox, with every website that mainline Firefox does.</p>
				<p>I created a small Preference Pane which makes it easy to download new builds of Firefox Dynasty, and attempts to make Firefox better comform to Apple&#39;s Human Interface Guidelines. All real credit goes to i3roly.</p>
				
				<p>After installing the Preference Pane, I recommend completely deleting the ancient version of Safari included with Mavericks. Safari 9 is <em>not</em> safe to use in 2025!</p>
				<blockquote>sudo rm -r /Applications/Safari.app</blockquote>
				
				<h4>Aqua Proxy</h4>
				<p>Firefox Dynasty covers our web browsing needs, but we&#39;ll still run into trouble with other internet-enabled apps. Dictionary will say it can&#39;t connect to Wikipedia, and Mail will be unable to load many embedded images.</p>
				<p>These problems stem from Mavericks&#39;s outdated implementation of HTTPS/SSL/TLS. To fix them, use Aqua Proxy:</p>
				
				
				
				<p>Aqua Proxy is what&#39;s typically referred to as a local &#34;Man-in-the-Middle Proxy Server&#34;. It sits between you and the internet, captures your computer&#39;s traffic, and modifies it to be compatible with modern servers before sending it on its way.</p>
				
				<h3>Emojis</h3>
				<p>The Unicode Consortium has introduced a lot of new emojis since Mavericks was released. We need to add them to Mavericks!</p>
				
				
				
				<h3>Time Machine</h3>
				<p>This will be short. Please do grab a USB hard drive and use it to set up Time Machine in System Preferences.</p>
				<p>Backups are good, and once Time Machine is set up, you can make a change to your system and then easily undo it later. For example...</p>
				
				<h3>Delete Applications You Don&#39;t Use</h3>
				<p>If you try to drag the Chess app to the trash, Finder will complain that &#34;&#39;Chess&#39; can&#39;t be modified or deleted because it&#39;s required by OS X.&#34; Finder is wrong; Chess is not required, and you can delete it using the Terminal.</p>
				<p>I don&#39;t play Chess. I also don&#39;t use iTunes, don&#39;t own any DVDs, and don&#39;t read Apple iBooks on my computer. So, on a fresh install of Mavericks, I like to open the Terminal and run:</p>
				<blockquote>
				sudo rm -rf &#34;/Applications/Chess.app&#34;</blockquote>
				<p>Don&#39;t you <em>love</em> how hackable everything is? Removing stock apps from the Applications folder is completely safe—nothing will break—and this is <em>your</em> computer, so you should make it your own. You can always restore apps later using Time Machine. Just don&#39;t delete System Preferences, or anything in the Utilities folder.</p>

				<h2 id="security">Security Patches</h2>
				<p>Apple has not released a security patch for Mavericks since 2016. Today, it an inherently vulnerable operating system, and you will need to be a bit careful. Regularly back up your data to cold storage, never use an outdated web browser, and always keep your router&#39;s firmware up-to-date.</p>
				<p>Although they are by no means comprehensive, I&#39;ve also made some security patches you should install:</p>
				
				<p>After installing the Font Security Patch, you <em>must</em> keep <strong>System Preferences</strong> → <strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong> → <strong>General</strong> → <strong>Allow apps downloaded from</strong> set to &#34;Anywhere&#34;, because the patched file has a different code signature.</p>

				<h2 id="accounts">Logging Into Online Services</h2>
				<p>Logging into internet accounts from Mavericks can be a bit tricky sometimes. Here are guides for some common online services:</p>
				
				<h3>Apple Accounts / iCloud</h3>
				<div>
					<div>
						
						<div>
							<div>
								<p>Start by logging in to <strong>System Preferences</strong> → <strong>Internet Accounts</strong> with the standard username and password for your Apple Account. System Preferences will say that &#34;an Apple ID verification code is required&#34; and you should recieve a verification code on one of your other devices.</p>
								<p>Sign in again, but this time, put your password followed by the verification code you recieved into the password field. For example, if your password was <strong>correcthorsebatterystaple</strong> and your verification code was <strong>123456</strong> you would put <strong>correcthorsebatterystaple123456</strong> in the password field.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						
						<div>
							<div>
								<p>Make sure Aqua Proxy is installed. Then:</p>
										<ol>
										<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654" target="_blank">Create an app-specific password</a> for your Apple account</li>
										<li>In <strong>System Preferences</strong> → <strong>Internet Accounts</strong>, click <strong>Add Other Account...</strong></li>
										<li>Select <strong>Add a Mail Account</strong> and click <strong>Create...</strong></li>
										<li>Enter your name, email address ending in @icloud.com, and app password.</li>
										<li>
											Under <strong>Incoming Mail Server Info</strong>, enter:
											<ul>
												<li>Page 1:
													<ul>
														<li>Account Type: IMAP</li>
														<li>Mail Server: localhost</li>
														<li>
															User Name: (your email) @icloud.com@imap.mail.me.com
															<ul>
																<li>Example: <em>johnappleseed@icloud.com@imap.mail.me.com</em></li>
																<li>Your user name should include exactly two @ symbols.</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>Password: (your app password)</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>Page 2:
													<ul>
														<li>Path Prefix: (leave blank)</li>
														<li>Port: 6532</li>
														<li>Use SSL: (disable/uncheck)</li>
														<li>Authentication: Password</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>
											Under <strong>Outgoing Mail Server Info</strong>, enter:
											<ul>
												<li>Page 1:
													<ul>
														<li>SMTP Server: localhost</li>
														<li>
															User Name: (your email) @icloud.com@smtp.mail.me.com
															<ul>
																<li>Example: <em>johnappleseed@icloud.com@smtp.mail.me.com</em></li>
																<li>Again, your user name should include two @ symbols.</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>Password: (your app password)</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
												<li>Page 2:
													<ul>
														<li>Port: 6533</li>
														<li>Use SSL: (disable/uncheck)</li>
														<li>Authentication: Password</li>
													</ul>
												</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									
								</ol>
							</div>
							<p><small>For MobileMe email addresses, substitute &#34;@me.com&#34; for &#34;@icloud.com&#34; above.</small>
						</p></div>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						
						<div>
							<div>
								<p>Wait at least 30 minutes without attempting to sign in to any Apple services. Then:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>In <strong>System Preferences</strong> → <strong>iCloud</strong>, click the box next to <strong>Keychain</strong>. If prompted &#34;Requiring a password to unlock your screen is recommended&#34;, choose &#34;Not Now&#34;. We are not actually going to enable iCloud Keychain.</li>
									<li>Enter the password for your Apple account. System Preferences will say &#34;iCloud Keychain could not be turned on&#34;, which is fine. However, you should recieve a verification code from Apple.</li>
									<li>In the Messages app, sign into iMessage with (1) your Apple ID and (2) your password followed by the verification code you recieved. For example, if your password was <strong>hunter</strong> and your verification code was <strong>654321</strong>, you would enter <strong>hunter654321</strong> in the password field.</li>
								</ol>
								<p>If anything goes wrong, you may need to wait 30 minutes before trying again.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						
						<div>
							<div>
								<p>iCloud Keychain will not work on Mavericks. I recommend using Bitwarden to manage passwords.</p>
								<p>On most Apple accounts, Reminders created in Mavericks will not sync to other Apple devices via iCloud. To use Reminders across multiple devices, I recommend <a href="https://fruux.com/" target="_blank">fruux.com</a>.</p>
								<p>You will not be able to log in to FaceTime on Mavericks.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<h4>Google Accounts</h4>
				<div>
					<div>
						
						<div>
							<div>
								<p>To log in to a Google account from Mavericks, you will need to use an &#34;app password&#34; in lieu of your normal password. Go to <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security" target="_blank">myaccount.google.com/security</a>, select the &#34;app passwords&#34; option, and follow the instructions.</p>
								<p>If you don&#39;t see an option for &#34;app passwords&#34;, you will need to turn on &#34;2-Step Verification&#34; to make it appear. Unfortunately, there is no way to avoid turning on 2-Step Verification.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div>
						
						<div>
							<div>
								<p>For some reason, a small number of Google accounts need to be added to Mavericks in a different way. If you are using an app password but still can&#39;t seem to sign in, follow the below instructions instead. This is usually not necessary and still requires an app password.</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Email
										<ol>
											<li>In <strong>System Preferences</strong> → <strong>Internet Accounts</strong>, click <strong>Add Other Account...</strong></li>
											<li>Select <strong>Add a Mail account</strong></li>
											<li>Enter your full email address and app password where indicated</li>
											<li>When asked which services to enable, deselect everything except Mail</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>Calendar
										<ol>
											<li>In <strong>System Preferences</strong> → <strong>Internet Accounts</strong>, click <strong>Add Other Account...</strong></li>
											<li>Select <strong>Add a CalDAV account</strong></li>
											<li>Enter your full email address and app password where indicated</li>
											<li>Set the <strong>server address</strong> to <strong>apidata.googleusercontent.com</strong></li>
											<li>Enter your full email address and app password where indicated</li>
										</ol>
									</li>

				<h3>QuickTime Player</h3>
				<p>I just love watching videos in QuickTime Player X! It has a beautiful interface which gets out of the way when I don&#39;t need it but comes back exactly when I do.</p>
				<p>Unfortunately, QuickTime works with very few video formats. It used to have a plugin infrastructure, which would have made it possible to add support for new video codecs like VP9 and HEVC—but wouldn&#39;t you know it, Apple removed plugin support beginning with version 10.3 introduced in, wait for it, Mavericks!</p>
				<p>Well, that won&#39;t do! Replace QuickTime 10.3 with this patched version of QuickTime 10.2 from Mountain Lion.</p>
				
				
				
				<h3>Components</h3>
				<p>Now install some components so QuickTime can play more types of media!</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		
		
		
		<div>
			<div>
				<p>With these components installed, QuickTime should be able to play every mainstream video format you come across.</p>
				<p>There is one caveat. Some modern video formats require a lot of processing power to play at full speed. Newer devices use &#34;hardware decoders&#34; built into their chips to play these formats, but Mavericks-era hardware does not have that luxury. Your mileage will vary depending on your computer, the type of video, and the video&#39;s resolution and framerate.</p>
				
				<h3>Downloading Videos</h3>
				<p>Now all we need are videos to play in QuickTime! Here are some ways to get them.</p>
				
				
			</div>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="archives-and-images">Archives &amp; Images</h2>
				<p>Next, let&#39;s make Apple&#39;s other apps work with more types of files. I want to be able to open 7z files in Archive Utility and WebP images in Preview. These apps don&#39;t come with a built-in plugin infrastructure like QuickTime, so we&#39;ll need to install SIMBL.</p>
				
				<p>Now we&#39;re ready to install some SIMBL plugins!</p>
				
				<div>
					<div>
						
						<div>
							<div>
								<h6>Archive Utility</h6>
								<p>For most formats, Archive Utility works by calling command-line programs such as tar or gunzip to do the actual decompression. We can do that too! The plugin tells Archive Utility to use a copy of 7zz included in the bundle to decompress new formats.</p>
								<h6>Preview</h6>
								<p>Preview natively uses QuickLook generators to display iWork and Microsoft Office documents. The QuickLook API is well-documented, and many third-party generators exist, including for all the formats we&#39;d like to work in Preview! Unfortunately, Preview has a built-in whitelist of file types it will display via QuickLook generators. The SIMBL plugin merely adds new formats to this whitelist.</p>
