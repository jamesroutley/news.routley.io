    <h1>LastPass appears to be holding users&#39; passwords hostage</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>LastPass is likely knowingly restricting users from exporting their passwords while putting their new pricing plan into effect. This makes the user have to choose between paying an increased price for LastPass or losing access to all of their online accounts. If this is true, they are in major violation of Article 20 of the GDPR.</p><p>As discussed on <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/software/comments/s053t3/lastpass_is_holding_peoples_data_hostage_and_it/" rel="nofollow noopener">the r/software subreddit</a>, LastPass is using multiple tactics to trap users into their ecosystem:</p><p>&#34;â€¢ Only making the export function available via the desktop browser plugin, despite locking peoples accounts to either Desktop or Mobile after 3 switches between these platforms.</p><p>If this is an intentional tactic being employed by LastPass, they could be subject to administrative fines up to 20,000,000 EUR or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the last financial year (whichever of the two is higher). This also makes it possible for European users to report them to member nations&#39; <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en" rel="nofollow noopener">data protection authorities</a>. They can also be reported to the United Kingdom&#39;s <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/your-personal-information-concerns/" rel="nofollow noopener">Information Commissioner&#39;s Office</a>.</p><p>Recommended open source alternatives to LastPass include <a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/bitwarden--free-password-manager/"><img alt="Small Bitwarden icon" src="https://d4.alternativeto.net/MCUKtvjpO85MSFrNX_J6piwRdKjkNMbbTef9fDyXQkw/rs:fill:40:40:0/g:ce:0:0/YWJzOi8vZGlzdC9pY29ucy9iaXR3YXJkZW4tLWZyZWUtcGFzc3dvcmQtbWFuYWdlcl8xNjY2MzIucG5n.png"/>Bitwarden</a> and <a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/keepass/"><img alt="Small KeePass icon" src="https://d4.alternativeto.net/OE9s4Xam9he2PYMapu7PmLilYKqH0YIhSOqjDix_gjE/rs:fill:40:40:0/g:ce:0:0/YWJzOi8vZGlzdC9pY29ucy9rZWVwYXNzXzk1Mjk5LnBuZw.png"/>KeePass</a>.</p><p>Further coverage:</p></span></p></div>
