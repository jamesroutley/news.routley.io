    <p>I asked Google Gemini a pretty basic developer question. The answer was unremarkable, apart from it mentioning in conclusion that it knows I previously used a tool called Alembic:</p>

<p>Cool, it&#39;s starting to remember things about me. Let&#39;s confirm:</p>

<p>Ok, maybe not yet.</p>
<p>However, clicking &#34;Show thinking&#34; for the above response is absolutely wild:</p>

<p>I know about the “Personal Context” feature now — it’s great. But why is Gemini instructed not to divulge its existence? And why does it decide to lie to cover up violating its privacy policies? I’m starting to believe that “maximally truth-seeking” might indeed be the right north star for AI.</p>
