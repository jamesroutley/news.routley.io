    <h1>Ask HN: What projects do you donate to?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>With the Internet rapidly undergoing its corpocene mass extinction event, the few initiatives trying to keep the web and the software ecosphere habitable depends mostly on individual contributions.</p><p>Traditionally, advertising your charitable contributions might be seen as distasteful virtue signalling for which one has already earned their reward. However, I think in the cultural context of digital initiatives, it’s actually helpful and quite important to show off what you have been donating to, it is a much stronger signal to draw people’s attention to important projects by word of mouth.</p><p>Thus, this thread is intended to be a celebration of your personal contributions to initiatives towards digital freedom.</p><p>Think of it as an “MyAnimeList for donations”, or a “Goodreads for open projects”, list out which projects you <i>personally</i> have your sights on you think are important that other people also hear about.</p><p>Examples:</p><p>- the Blender project: a lifeline to rescue creative professionals from the clutches of artistic bear-bile farms</p><p>- neocities: promoting a return to wholesome hand-reared digital gardens</p><p>- Internet Archive and Wikipedia foundation: for keeping library of Alexandria of collective human memories and knowledge</p><p>- codeberg: provides a safe haven for open source development from being confined to a life inside factory farms.</p></div></div></div>
