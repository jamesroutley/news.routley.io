    <h1>It Is Somebody&#39;s Moral Imperative to Leak &#34;Coyote vs. Acme&#34; to the World</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/coyote-vs-acme-update-offers-warner-bros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an excellent report on The Wrap revealed that</a>, despite initially walking back its decision, Warner Bros. is indeed intent on throwing <em>Coyote vs Acme</em>--a funded, shot and completed motion picture--in the trash. Not because it sucks, but to save some money on taxes.</p><p>It&#39;s not the first time this has happened recently--&#34;content&#34; ranging<a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-streaming-cuts-tax-writeoffs-1850502594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> from Disney TV shows</a> to a <em>Batgirl </em>movie has met with the same fate--but this one stung a little more. Disney and HBO removing TV shows that people had already had a chance to see was one thing, and <em>Batgirl</em><a href="https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/film/batgirl-movie-so-bad-not-releasable-says-dc-studios-3390857#:~:text=&#39;Batgirl&#39;%20movie%20was%20so%20bad%20it%20was%20%E2%80%9Cnot,releasable%E2%80%9D%2C%20says%20DC%20Studios%20boss&amp;text=Leslie%20Grace%20as%20&#39;Batgirl&#39;%20CREDIT,Grace%2C%20Brandon%20Fraser%20and%20J.K." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> </em>was reportedly also very bad</a>, which was another.</p><p>But <em>Coyote vs Acme</em> has been seen by <em>nobody</em>. The movie--directed by Dave Green, written by may December&#39;s Samy Burch, produced by (among others) James Gunn and starring characters that define Warner Bros.&#39; entire existence--was paid for, is finished, is ready to be seen, and now it stands a very real chance of being deleted forever, just to save a company some money.</p><p>It&#39;s an incredibly dystopian situation we all find ourselves in, where art is only made to be fed into a woodchipper to serve shareholders, and it&#39;s one<a href="https://www.looper.com/1161829/hollywood-creatives-are-breathing-fire-over-the-current-trend-of-tv-tax-write-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that&#39;s been covered extensively elsewhere</a>, so I&#39;m not going to get into the reeds over the politics and economics of the decision here.</p><p>What I am going to say, though, is that if you work at Warner Bros., or anywhere related to Warner Bros., and you have any access to this movie whatsoever, it&#39;s your moral imperative to leak it to the world before it&#39;s too late. If Warner Bros. don&#39;t want to release it, and have reportedly blocked attempts for other companies to release it, then what does it matter?</p><p>(<strong>Please note</strong>: I am not a lawyer or law enforcement officer and this does not constitute actual advice).</p><p>As we <em>have </em>covered previously,<a href="https://aftermath.site/there-is-no-piracy-without-ownership" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there is no piracy without ownership</a>. If we can&#39;t buy or rent the thing, and likely never will be able to do so via legal means, then leaking this movie and putting it on torrent sites shouldn&#39;t be seen as stealing, either. By all accounts Warner CEO David Zaslav is happy throwing this movie in the bin, without selling a single theatre ticket or digital rental, so whether we get to see it for free or not doesn&#39;t move that financial needle one bit.</p><p>What leaking the movie <em>would </em>do is save a piece of art that hundreds of people poured their hearts and souls into for months or even <em>years</em>. That shouldn&#39;t be a crime. That&#39;s public service.Â </p></div></div>
