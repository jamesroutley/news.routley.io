    <h1>Ask HN: What&#39;s the best hackable smart TV?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I want to get a second TV which will more or less be a second monitor for my System76 laptop which is plugged into a bunch of music equipment, like a korg midi keyboard, and a novation drum pad, all of which work great with linux.</p><p>I want to buy this TV used. I&#39;m seeing a bunch of Samsung, LG, RCA, Sony, etc on Facebook Marketplace. What a cesspool Facebook has become, right?</p><p>Any suggestions on the best brand or even model for that kind of thing? I don&#39;t really want to battle with a bunch of shit that tries to coerce me to install another app from a streaming provider slash gambling entrypoint.</p><p>I imagine mostly it will just need HDMI to work, and all the TVs will support that. But, I thought maybe there would be a fun brand that offers interesting other options.</p></div></div></div>
