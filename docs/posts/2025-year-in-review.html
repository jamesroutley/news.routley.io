              <p>
                I&#39;ve been meaning to write a year-in-review blog post for 2025
                since before the new year. Now, it&#39;s 18 days into 2026. That is
                approximately 1/20th of a year. In other words, 20 of these
                makes 1 year. That feels weird to think about!
              </p>
              <p>
                I think that I put off writing this until now because,
                subconsciously, a part of me did not want to review this past
                year. Some things happened that were very tough, both in my own
                life and in the world in general. I won&#39;t go into detail about
                political or economic situations in the United States in 2025,
                because you either are already aware of them, or can find out
                from many other sources. But some of them did affect me
                personally in various ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                Meanwhile, in the comparatively microscopic scale of my own
                life, I moved to a new city and executed a job search in a
                less-than-ideal market. Then, in the fall, I experienced the
                death of a friend, a week of incapacitating illness, and the
                engine failure of a vehicle, all within a very short span of
                time. While these things were difficult for me, I don&#39;t lead
                with them to lament, but rather, to acknowledge what happened
                and to hold myself with extra gentleness, and appreciate that I
                am still here, enjoying life and creating things every day.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even though I procrastinated this blog post for weeks, a part of
                me also knew that it would be helpful to look back and recall
                the things that went well over the past year. So I&#39;ll write a
                bit about those things below.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  At the beginning of the year, I spent six weeks doing a coding
                  retreat at
                  <a href="https://www.recurse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recurse Center</a>, where I took time to further develop my programming skills,
                  met lots of really nice and smart people, and built a
                  <a href="https://subtle.cards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtual tarot card app</a>
                  as well as a variety of little experimental things.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Later in the year, coasting on the high of my programming work
                  at Recurse Center, I built myself a custom minimalist
                  journaling app, which runs on a tiny raspberry pi server on my
                  desk.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I delved further into self-hosting, as well as home
                  automation, with some more projects that I definitely spent
                  way too much time on:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Repurposed an e-ink reader as a wall-mounted clock and
                      live calendar/weather display, through the power of linux
                      and python.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Started running home assistant, a very powerful open
                      source home automation app, on a &#34;server&#34; (old
                      computer) in my home.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Established direct local control of various cheap and
                      miscellaneous wifi-controlled light bulbs throughout our
                      home. (No more relying on random companies&#39; cloud servers
                      and abandonware.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Set up a network of small battery-powered buttons and
                      switches, running on the Zigbee radio protocol, which are
                      linked into Home Assistant to control things in our home.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                  Started a new job working at an
                  <a href="https://faruqeedriscollstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">art studio</a>, where I learned about (and helped develop) unique processes
                  for creating mathematical patterns and translating things
                  between the physical and the digital. Also improved my skills
                  with woodworking, which I brought into my home life by making
                  some nice furniture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The people I work for adopted a puppy named Thor, and I watch
                  him all the time, so I consider him a little bit my dog too. I
                  love him and it&#39;s so cool to watch him grow up.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Settled into our new home base of New Haven, Connecticut, met
                  some lovely new people, and set up a home studio that I really
                  enjoy working in.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Did 4 collaborative performances as <em>Reality Orp</em> with
                  my partner (in both life and the band) Andrei. I also did one
                  solo audiovisual performance and one in collaboration with
                  fellow artist
                  <a href="https://leetusman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lee Tusman</a>. So I played 6 shows in total.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I also did 3 talks/workshops, and had one of my video art
                  pieces screened in Croatia.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Read 17 books in total. 6 of them were from
                  <em>The Expanse</em> series by James S. A. Corey, which I
                  ravenously demolished all of starting in late 2024. And 3 were
                  from the <em>Divine Cities</em> trilogy by Robert Jackson
                  Bennett.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Watched 90 movies. Um... Wow. Andrei and I have been on a kick
                  of watching tons of movies together over the past year. It&#39;s a
                  lot of fun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Started a membership at my local makerspace, where I used the
                  laser cutter, wood shop, and printmaking studio.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Made and sent out 5 editions of Mystery Objects for
                  <a href="https://palomakop.tv/zine-club">zine club</a>. I also made several
                  e-zines.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Made my own <a href="https://palomakop.tv/notes/runicon-cypher">font</a> for the
                  first time.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Built some new pages for this website, including
                  <a href="https://palomakop.tv/links">my links page</a> and a new section called
                  <a href="https://palomakop.tv/notes">notes</a>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Moved one of my main email addresses off of Google, and
                  migrated to a custom email domain, to avoid future lock-in. It
                  was a lot of work but I finally took the time to do it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Made a deck of cards of
                  <a href="https://palomakop.tv/notes/arena-cards">my creative ideas</a>. This
                  project straddled the new year, but I&#39;m including it anyway!
                </li>
                <li>
                  Started a biweekly music collaboration project with a friend,
                  for which I&#39;ve made 3 songs so far.
                </li>
                <li>Spent time with people I love.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Sometimes, what we say no to can be just as important, or even
                more important, than what we do. Whether it&#39;s to take time to
                rest, or to make more time to work on things I care about,
                <em>not</em> doing things is a skill I am learning to value more
                and more. So while I&#39;m proud of the things I&#39;ve done, I also
                want to recognize, and even appreciate, the blank spaces in this
                list that only I can see: things I chose not to do at all. I
                want to be intentional about how I spend my time, and make sure
                it aligns with my values. And I think that, over time, I&#39;m
                moving in the right direction in that regard.
              </p>
              <p>
                OK, that&#39;s enough reviewing for now. Time to come back to the
                present, and see what comes next. Onward!
