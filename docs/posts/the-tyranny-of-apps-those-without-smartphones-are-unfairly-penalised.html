    <h1>&#39;The tyranny of apps&#39;: those without smartphones are unfairly penalised</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Michael is in his late 50s and is among the millions of people in the UK who cannot or do not want to use mobile apps, and feels he is being penalised for his choice.</p><p>He does own a smartphone – an Apple iPhone he bought secondhand about three years ago – but says: “I don’t use apps at all. I don’t download them for security reasons.”</p><p>Apps have burrowed their way into seemingly every aspect of our lives and there are lots of reasons why companies are pushing us to use them. With an app, it is often “one click and you’re in”, rather than having to faff around online finding the website and remembering passwords. It is also for the “push notifications” that mobile apps send to grab our attention and get us to buy stuff. Many tech experts also argue that apps are generally more secure than websites and allow banks and others to carry out sophisticated ID verification using face, voice and fingerprint biometrics.</p><p>But millions of people who cannot afford a smartphone or have an older device that does not support some services are increasingly being locked out of deals, discounts and even some vital services, say digital exclusion and pro-cash campaigners.</p><p>They are missing out on everything from savings on their weekly shop, to some of the best interest rates for their cash. And not signing up to the app revolution is making activities including paying for parking and going to concerts increasingly challenging.</p><p>“It’s the tyranny of the apps,” says Ron Delnevo, the chair of the campaign committee at lobby group the <a href="https://www.paymentchoicealliance.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Payment Choice Alliance</a>. “In this country we’re being treated like sheep,” he says. “We’re always being told there’s no alternative.” But when a new smartphone can set you back hundreds of pounds, it is “an expensive passport to participate”, Delnevo says.</p><p>According to the latest data from the telecoms regulator Ofcom, 8% of people aged 16 or over do not have a smartphone, which for the UK translates into just under 4.5 million people. Among those aged 75-plus, the proportion is said to be 28%. Add in all those who don’t or can’t use apps and the total number of people affected is a lot bigger.</p><p>Lots of retailers offer enhanced or exclusive deals to their app users, and some run loyalty schemes through them. This is potentially a big deal as those schemes often give you access to discounts that are not otherwise available.</p><p>“Some people are missing out on lower prices offered by loyalty schemes as they do not have access to phones or smart devices to download apps,” Reena Sewraz, the retail editor at Which? says.</p><p>The consumer group is among those to have highlighted Lidl’s loyalty scheme, Lidl Plus, as one that is only accessible via an app, with an email address also required. That means the “big savings” available via the scheme’s weekly offers – at the time of writing these included 25% off tinned tuna and 20% off microwave rice and grain pouches – plus various coupons and rewards, are off-limits to those who cannot or do not wish to go digital.</p><p>Delnevo says Lidl is “disenfranchising” many of its customers, adding: “The people who probably need the discounts most are the people who can’t afford or don’t have a smartphone.”</p><p>In response, the supermarket chain says the Lidl Plus scheme “forms part of our commitment to providing customers with the best value. Nonetheless, we remain mindful of those who don’t have access to a smartphone or tablet and continue to offer in-store promotions through our ‘pick of the week’ offers.”</p><p>Rival supermarket Asda also runs a scheme, Asda Rewards, where you have to download an app and there is no physical card available. This scheme does not offer price promotions – instead, you earn Asda “pounds” when you shop, which you convert into vouchers to spend in-store and online.</p><p>Some retailers have gone further down the app path than others. The Boots Advantage card scheme, one of the UK’s most popular, still lets you use a physical plastic card, although there are “tailored offers” available via the app.</p><figure id="ab16895f-3f98-4c27-abce-c62853d6e72b" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Customers with pastries and coffee in a Greggs bakery" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23d3e6d6a058e57eb942e300c1f0d54f9cecc3a4/0_233_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="267" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>At Greggs you get a free hot drink just for downloading the app.</span> Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>And at the bakery chain Greggs, you can collect loyalty “stamps” for free food and drink and get “exclusive app-only gifts”. You currently get a free hot drink just for downloading the app.</p><p>Meanwhile, the online clothes retailer Asos and the tools and hardware specialist Screwfix are just two of those that are or have recently been running “app exclusive” campaigns.

In the UK there are thought to be at least 30 different parking apps, and it is not unusual for an individual to have eight to 10 different ones on their phone.</p><p>Many older people have told the charity Age UK that they are “<a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/siteassets/documents/reports-and-publications/reports-and-briefings/offline-and-overlooked-report.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">at the end of their tether</a>” when it comes to paying for parking because they cannot park if an app or mobile is required. “In some cases this has meant missing important appointments like seeing their GP,” it adds.</p><figure id="64e31138-e1f2-4748-b504-3074d91d0c5d" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef4d0b2c9163735a910a40c85d7bebcee1a334e/0_276_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef4d0b2c9163735a910a40c85d7bebcee1a334e/0_276_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef4d0b2c9163735a910a40c85d7bebcee1a334e/0_276_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef4d0b2c9163735a910a40c85d7bebcee1a334e/0_276_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef4d0b2c9163735a910a40c85d7bebcee1a334e/0_276_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef4d0b2c9163735a910a40c85d7bebcee1a334e/0_276_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="PaybyPhone parking meters on a street next to some parked cars" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aef4d0b2c9163735a910a40c85d7bebcee1a334e/0_276_8192_4918/master/8192.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="267.152099609375" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Many older people have told Age UK they cannot park if an app or mobile is required.</span> Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</figcaption></figure><p>The RAC’s head of policy, Simon Williams, says many people are overwhelmed by the multitude of apps they have to use, “when in reality you want one that you like and you’re happy using and that you can use everywhere”.</p><p>Six years ago the Department for Transport started developing a “national parking platform” (NPP) designed to enable drivers to use one app of their choice to pay for all their parking. It has been trialled by a number of councils, but a big question mark hangs over its future as public funding for the project looks likely to be withdrawn.</p><p>Some councils are now permanently getting rid of parking ticket machines that accept debit and credit cards in order to save money (many stopped accepting cash a long time ago).</p><p>The London borough of Barnet is one area where all the council pay and display machines at car parks have just been taken out of service. As of last month, motorists have been greeted with signs telling them to use the PayByPhone app.</p><p>“Withdrawal of the ability to pay by card, following the removal of the payment by cash facility, will disappoint some drivers, especially the elderly, who find it difficult to use the PayByPhone app,” according to <a href="https://www.barnetsociety.org.uk/barnet-council-planning-22-million-in-cuts-and-another-significant-hike-in-council-tax-to-tackle-spending-crisis" data-link-name="in body link">an article on the Barnet Society website</a>.</p><p>A Barnet council spokesperson says: “Pay and display machines were declining in use and in 2023-24 accounted for less than 7% of overall transactions. There are easy alternatives … including the PayByPhone app, phone or text, and cash payments at over 100 local PayPoint retailers.”</p><h2 id="entertainment"><strong>Entertainment</strong></h2><p>Increasingly with gigs and other events, you need to download an app to access your tickets.</p><p>For example, tickets for some events at the O2 arena in London are delivered as a “mobile ID” via the venue’s own app, and you get a barcode which is scanned to let you in.</p><p>This type of app-based mobile ID system is also billed as the only admission method at venues including Ovo Arena Wembley in London and University of Wolverhampton at The Halls.</p><figure id="7c4dbdbb-6569-41cc-b087-6bb1f1696421" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="James Bay sings and plays guitar on stage at the OVO Arena in London" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d01462a76cfed6e254cb9ccd4844cc4a9ec8241/0_342_5318_3192/master/5318.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="267.1004136893569" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>James Bay at the OVO Arena in London, where an app-based system is billed as the only admission method.</span> Photograph: Gus Stewart/Redferns</figcaption></figure><p>That said, the venue websites do usually provide details of how people who do not have a smartphone or cannot download the app can gain entry to their event – but it might involve bringing photo ID and your confirmation email to the box office perhaps 90 minutes before the doors open.</p><p>When it comes to theatre, popular services such as TodayTix offer savings on tickets and can be accessed online, although to take advantage of some of the benefits and offers, such as discounted same-day “Rush” tickets, you need to have the app.</p><h2 id="eating-and-drinking"><strong>Eating and drinking</strong></h2><p>Those who cannot or do not use apps are missing out on some of the best deals for meals, takeaways and pub grub.</p><p>McDonald’s is running a high-profile promotion called Deal Drop, where it offers items at “bargain” prices, such as a classic Big Mac for £1.49 (normally £4.99) and a children’s Happy Meal for £1.99 (normally £3.59) – but all of the discounts are available exclusively with the<strong> </strong>company’s app.</p><p>The fastfood chain Subway runs a loyalty scheme where you earn points that you can convert into “Subway Cash” that can be spent on anything on the menu – but again it is app-only.

For example, saving and investing firm Moneybox primarily provides its services via its app, but says you can access them through other means, including its website.</p><p>Meanwhile, the high street banks sometimes have products or services that are app-only – for example, HSBC’s Global Money service, which lets you convert, spend and send multiple currencies with no bank fees, is only available via the HSBC app.</p></div></div></div>
