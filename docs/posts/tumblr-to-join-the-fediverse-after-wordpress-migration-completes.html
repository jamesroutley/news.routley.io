    <h1>Tumblr to join the Fediverse after WordPress migration completes</h1>

<p id="speakable-summary">Since <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/tumblr-to-add-support-for-activitypub-the-social-protocol-powering-mastodon-and-other-apps/">2022</a>, blogging site Tumblr has been teasing its plans to integrate with the fediverse — the open social web powered by the protocol ActivityPub also used by Mastodon, Threads, Flipboard, and others. Now, the Automattic-owned blogging platform is sharing more information about when and how that integration could actually happen.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the current plan to tie Tumblr into the open social web will come about by way of the site’s planned <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/tumblr-to-move-its-half-a-billion-blogs-to-wordpress/">move to the WordPress infrastructure</a>.</p>







<p>Automattic confirmed to TechCrunch that when the migration is complete, every Tumblr user will be able to federate their blog via ActivityPub, just as every WordPress.com user can today.</p>

<p>The company noted that the migration could also allow for other open web integrations, like giving Tumblr users a way to run other custom plug-ins or themes.</p>

<p>Last summer, Automattic announced it would <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/28/tumblr-to-move-its-half-a-billion-blogs-to-wordpress/">move its half a billion blogs to WordPress</a>, to make it easier for the company to build tools and features that worked across both services, while also allowing Tumblr to take advantage of the open source developments from WordPress.org. </p>

<p>Though the WordPress community itself <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/12/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/">is in a state of upheaval</a>, ultimately running Tumblr’s back end on WordPress would allow for greater efficiencies, while not changing the interface and experience that Tumblr’s user base has grown to love.</p>

<p>Automattic declined to share a time frame as to when the migration would be complete, given its scale, but a rep for the company called the progress so far “exciting.”</p>


<p>Users have been curious about the state of the company’s open social web integrations, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/11/tumblrs-fediverse-integration-is-still-being-worked-on-says-owner-and-automattic-ceo-matt-mullenweg/">Tumblr said in 2023 were still being worked on</a>. Recently, one user asked about the company’s plans in a Q&amp;A on <a href="https://wip.tumblr.com/post/773574776721702912/about-a-year-ago-wordpress-ceo-matt-mullenweg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tumblr’s Work In Progress blog</a>. Here, Tumblr confirmed that fediverse integration was “one big reason” for the migration itself, and that it would “for sure” include support for <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/14/wordpress-blogs-can-now-be-followed-in-the-fediverse-including-mastodon/">WordPress’ existing</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/11/wordpress-com-blogs-can-now-be-followed-on-mastodon-and-other-federated-platforms/">ActivityPub plug-ins</a>, which allow blog owners to sync their posts and participate in the wider open social web.</p>

<p>However, Automattic declined to share if it will at any point consider integration with the AT Protocol, which powers the growing social networking startup Bluesky, another open social web participant.</p>

<p>When asked specifically about how Bluesky might fit into these plans, a spokesperson would only comment on its ActivityPub progress. </p>
