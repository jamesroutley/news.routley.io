You probably do not know that nature has provided an automatic manipulator to correct most spinal and peripheral joint lesions in primates. In common with millions of other so called civilised people you suffer unnecessarily from musculoskeletal problems and are discouraged about how to treat the exponential rise in low back pain throughout the developed world. Humans are one of 200 species of primates.<sup><a href="#B1" rid="B1">1</a></sup> All primates suffer from musculoskeletal problems; nature, recognising this fact, has given primates a way to correct them.</p><p id="__p2">The study of animals in the wild has been a lifelong pursuit. I grew up with tribal people and in 1953-4 commanded a platoon of African soldiers from nine tribes, who taught me to sleep on my side without a pillow so that I could listen out for danger with both ears. I have organised over 14 expeditions all over the world to meet native peoples and study their sleeping and resting postures. They all adopted similar postures and exhibited few musculoskeletal problems. I must emphasise that this is not a comparison of genes or races but of lifestyles. I tried to carry out surveys to collect evidence but they were meaningless, as tribespeople give you the answer they think you want. They often object to having their photographs taken, so I have demonstrated the postures. </p><div><div><h3 id="__sec1title">Summary points</h3><ul><li><p>Forest dwellers and nomads suffer fewer musculoskeletal lesions than “civilised” people</p></li><li><p>Nature&#39;s automatic manipulator during sleep is the kickback against the vertebrae by the ribs when the chest is prevented from movement by the forest floor</p></li><li><p>Various resting postures correct different joints</p></li><li><p>Pillows are not necessary</p></li></ul></div></div></div><div id="__sec2"><h2 id="__sec2title">Some instinctive sleeping postures</h2><p id="__p8">Figure <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119282/figure/F1/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F1" rid-ob="ob-F1" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F1"><span>​</span><span>1</span></a> shows a mountain gorilla lying on the ground on his side without a pillow—a position in which I have also seen chimpanzees and gibbons sleeping—and a Kenya African in a similar position on a palm leaf mattress on a concrete floor.

I think the neck should deviate towards the ground as gravity then shuts the mouth, preventing insects from entering, and a little traction is applied to the cervical spine (fig <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119282/figure/F2/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F2" rid-ob="ob-F2" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F2"><span>​</span><span>2</span></a>, top). When the head is down, the vertebrae are stretched between two anchors and every time the ribs move through breathing the tension is increased, the vertebrae realign themselves, and the movement keeps the joints lubricated. Current thinking is to keep the spine straight by use of a pillow. Has anyone ever seen a gorilla shinning up a tree with a pillow? Note also the plantar flexed foot. A dorsiflexed foot rotates the knee and alters the Q angle (between the resultant pull of the quadriceps muscle and the patella tendon), producing uneven wear and, in time, pain. </p><!--fig ft0--><!--fig mode=article f1--><div id="F2" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F2"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119282/figure/F2/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F2" rid-ob="ob-F2"><!--fig/graphic|fig/alternatives/graphic mode="anchored" m1--></a><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm139779267997424"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&amp;p=PMC3&amp;id=1119282_tetm6245.f2b.jpg" target="tileshopwindow" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.

When the legs are in the reverse recovery position (fig <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119282/figure/F2/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F2" rid-ob="ob-F2" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F2"><span>​</span><span>2</span></a>, bottom), the penis lies on the lower thigh and is protected. In this position the Achilles tendon of the leading foot can be inserted in the gap between the big toe and the first lesser toe to help correct a bunion.</p><p id="__p11">When sleeping in the open in very cold climates and when the ground is wet, humans often resort to sleeping on their shins, like the Tibetan caravaneers photographed by Peter, Prince of Greece and Denmark, in 1938 (fig <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119282/figure/F3/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F3" rid-ob="ob-F3" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F3"><span>​</span><span>3</span></a>). Nature has not covered the anterior border of the tibia and the medial border of the ulna with muscle, so in this position there is only skin and bone in contact with the cold ground and heat loss is reduced. The body is also folded to conserve heat; both ears can listen for danger, be it lion or terrorist; and when the head is down gravity shuts the mouth and it is impossible to snore.  </p><!--fig ft0--><!--fig mode=article f1--><div id="F3" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F3"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119282/figure/F3/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F3" rid-ob="ob-F3"><!--fig/graphic|fig/alternatives/graphic mode="anchored" m1--></a><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm139779263826944"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&amp;p=PMC3&amp;id=1119282_tetm6245.f3.jpg" target="tileshopwindow" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.

In the penis protect position, with the pelvis locked, the spine is rotated and flexed. With the elbows out sideways and the chest on the ground, many spinal lesions can be corrected gently using nature&#39;s automatic manipulator. Animals are clever because they use the radiant heat from the sun to encourage relaxation of their muscles when they adopt this posture. In this photograph note that the dog&#39;s sternum is in full contact with the ground but that of the human is not: this can be easily corrected by rotating the right arm medially to lower the sternum. It has been noted that guide dogs working in towns breathe the same pollutants as humans yet do not have asthma. Could this be because when they lie on their chests the kickback from the upper ribs keeps the corresponding vertebrae mobile, allowing the sympathetic system to work efficiently? </p><!--fig ft0--><!--fig mode=article f1--><div id="F5" co-legend-rid="lgnd_F5"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1119282/figure/F5/" target="figure" rid-figpopup="F5" rid-ob="ob-F5"><!--fig/graphic|fig/alternatives/graphic mode="anchored" m1--></a><div data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm139779266058768"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/core/lw/2.0/html/tileshop_pmc/tileshop_pmc_inline.html?title=Click%20on%20image%20to%20zoom&amp;p=PMC3&amp;id=1119282_tetm6245.f5.jpg" target="tileshopwindow" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" alt="An external file that holds a picture, illustration, etc.
