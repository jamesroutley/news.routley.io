    <h1>Windows users report appearance of unwanted HP app</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Windows users are reporting that Hewlett Packard&#39;s HP Smart application is appearing on their systems, despite them not having any of the manufacturer&#39;s hardware attached.</p>
<p>While Microsoft has remained tight-lipped on what is happening, folks on various social media platforms noted the app&#39;s appearance, which seems to afflict both Windows 10 and Windows 11.</p>
<p>The Windows Update mechanism is used to deploy third-party applications and drivers as well as Microsoft&#39;s updates, and we&#39;d bet someone somewhere has accidentally checked the wrong box.</p>

    

<p>Up to now, the response from affected users has been one of confusion.</p>

        


        

<p>One <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/186xbze/comment/kbcapfh/">noted</a> on Reddit: &#34;I thought that was just me. I didn&#39;t install it, it just appeared on new apps in start menu out of nowhere.&#34;</p>
<p>Another <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/186xbze/comment/kbbkn2b/">said</a>: &#34;I just checked and I had it installed too. Checking the event log for the Microsoft Store shows that it installed earlier today, but I definitely did [not] request or initiate it because I do not have any devices from HP.&#34;</p>

</ul>
<p>And, of course, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows11/comments/186xbze/comment/kbdkztd/">there was the inevitable</a>: &#34;Would it be <b>that</b> hard for Microsoft to just provide an operating system without needless bloat?&#34;</p>
<p>To be clear, not all users are affected. Our test Windows 10 PC was far too busy suggesting that we should take a look at Copilot to bother with the HP Smart app nonsense.</p>

        

<p>WindowsLatest <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2023/11/30/hp-smart-is-auto-installing-on-windows-11-and-windows-10-on-non-hp-machines/">reported</a> the issue occurring on both physical Windows 10 hardware and a Windows 11 virtual machine.</p>
<p>HP Smart is innocuous enough. It&#39;s an application used in conjunction with HP&#39;s printer hardware and can simply be uninstalled.</p>
<p>However, the question is how the application got installed in the first place on a machine with no HP hardware attached or on a network, according to affected users.</p>

        

<p>In a statement to WindowsLatest, Microsoft said it was aware of the reports and it would share more details soon. <em>The Register</em> asked Microsoft to comment and will report back with any response. Â®</p>
