<p>Here is a font i am working on; i hope you like it.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/010stork.png"/></p>
<p>The letterforms are reversed out against a vertically striped background.
In a manner similar to <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/32260/schaefer-versalien">Schaeffer
Versalien</a>.
The graphic effect is inspired-by/stolen-from Schaefer Versalien, but
the letterforms are modified from my found stencil font
<a href="https://drj11.itch.io/arugula-font">Arugula</a>.</p>
<p>Bear in the mind that with a font like this, the parts that are drawn
are the black parts.</p>
<p>So, let&#39;s consider a word like SALTY:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/020salty.png"/></p>
<p>Looks okay? Perhaps you think is fine and there is nothing to comment on.</p>
<p>What about the kerning, in this case between <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong>?
In the good old days of metal type the only kerns were when <code>/f</code> projected
outside the edge of its body.
This would not have been kerned and we were ok with that
(larger wooden type may have been kerned with a saw or a file, but
in this design, the cuts would have to be made to line up the stripes
exactly; tricky business).</p>
<p>Here’s what this particular example looks like without kerning:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/030saltynokern.png"/></p>
<p>I’m not going to go back and forth over the merits of kerning,
i‘m here for the nerdy technical details.</p>
<p>In most, normal, fonts kerning is done with position rules (GPOS lookups);
that doesn’t work here, because if we reposition <strong>T</strong> to
be slightly further left, we get something like this disaster:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/040saltybad.png"/></p>
<p>It looks a bit like <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong> have been clipped, but in fact
they’ve been drawn over. Black parts of <strong>L</strong> overlap
the <strong>T</strong>, and vice versa: black parts of the
<strong>T</strong> overlap <strong>L</strong>.
The effect is what you can see, where <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong> share a space,
the black bars overlap and are solid, obliterating the reversed out
letterforms.</p>
<p>So how do i kern this font, if not with GPOS lookups?</p>
<p>With GSUB lookups! GSUB (for substitution) lookups substitute
one sequence of glyphs for another.
The details can get quite complicated, but the way i use them here
is relatively simple.</p>
<p>I split <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong> into two pieces each, and recombine
the middle two pieces into the drawing of the kerned part.</p>
<p>I’ll illustrate the steps. With glyphs that have been articifically spaced out,
so that you can see each individual glyph.</p>
<p><strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong> as individual glyphs</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/050LTspace.png"/></p>
<p>Each of <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong> is split into two pieces. So we get 4 glyphs:
<code>/L.left</code> <code>/L.right</code> <code>/T.left</code> <code>T.right</code>.
This is done with GSUB lookup rule like <code>sub L by L.left L.right ;</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/060split.png"/></p>
<p>The two middle pieces, <code>/L.right</code> and <code>T.left</code>, get replaced with
what i call a <em>joiner</em> the kerned piece in the middle shared by
both <strong>L</strong> and <strong>T</strong>.</p>
<p>Here the GSUB rules look like <code>sub L.right T.left by L_T.joiner ;</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/070joined.png"/></p>
<p>That’s actually it. The next image is just the previous one without
the extra spacing, and is how it would actually appear.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://home.octetfont.com/blog/image/kerninghard/080LTcomplete.png"/></p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>The pattern of vertical stripes means that kerns can only be a multiple
of the stripe repeat (not quite true, and i have sketched out more
general versions of this, but it <em>is</em> true for this font).</p>
<p>The gaps in the pattern help avoid solid black-to-black joins, which
might work when everything is a vector, but tend to leave sub-1-pixel
gaps when rasterised.
The gaps are also why a glyph isn’t split down the middle to
make the <code>.left</code> and <code>.right</code> parts.
That would leave a sub-1-pixel gap when rejoining.
Better to split at a gap.</p>
<p>The glyph names, used in the rules above, don’t matter at that level,
but i suspect affect the PDF; in particular cutting-and-pasting
from PDF, so there might be some tweaking of names.</p>
<p>For each letter (glyph) that participates in kerning, there
are two more glyphs for its <code>.left</code> and <code>.right</code> parts.
And...</p>
<p>For each <em>kerned pair</em> there is a glyph for its joiner, because
each one is unique.
Those are going to mount up quickly, which suggests kerning
only when strictly necessary.</p>
<p>None of the splits and joiners are drawn by hand, and
none of the GSUB rules are made by hand.
In both cases it is a <em>Small Matter of Programming</em>,
also known as Custom Python Scripts.
The libraries <a href="https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools">fontTools</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/simoncozens/fontFeatures">fontFeatures</a> were <em>invaluable</em> in this.</p>
<p>This font is not yet complete, but right now it is a real font and
really does work like this.
I&#39;ve only kerned <strong>L</strong>, so there’s a few more kerns to do.
And right now is has a very basic alphabet, just A to Z;
i will draw some more letters and a few more decorative items, but
i plan for it to have a fairly small repertoire, partly because the
kerning and the vertical stripe design add to the constraints.</p>
<p>And if you thought kerning was problematic (and hopefully now you do),
consider how accents and other diacritics are going to work. ;)</p>
