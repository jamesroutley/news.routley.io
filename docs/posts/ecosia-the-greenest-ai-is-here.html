    <h1>Ecosia: The greenest AI is here</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>While the AI race is raging, we’ve been building a better alternative. One that’s helpful, private, and optional — and that puts the planet first. </p><h2 id="ai-but-thoughtful">AI, but thoughtful</h2><p>AI-powered chatbots and search tools are fast becoming the way people ask questions online. To meet this moment — and to keep using 100% of our profits for the planet — we’re rolling out two features today, alongside a refreshed look. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.ecosia.org/content/images/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-19.40.54.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1389" srcset="https://blog.ecosia.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-19.40.54.png 600w, https://blog.ecosia.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-19.40.54.png 1000w, https://blog.ecosia.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-19.40.54.png 1600w, https://blog.ecosia.org/content/images/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-19.40.54.png 2168w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>Overviews give you a quick summary at the top of your search results, always with citations so you can explore the original sources yourself.</p><p>Prefer the classic experience? You can turn Overviews off with a single click.</p><p>For more detailed questions or ongoing conversations, try<em> </em>AI Search — an interactive chat mode where you can ask anything, from plant-based recipes to travel ideas. You can also receive eco tips rooted in the latest environmental science, if you choose.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.ecosia.org/content/images/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-19.51.15.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1333" srcset="https://blog.ecosia.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-19.51.15.png 600w, https://blog.ecosia.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-19.51.15.png 1000w, https://blog.ecosia.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-19.51.15.png 1600w, https://blog.ecosia.org/content/images/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-28-at-19.51.15.png 2386w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><p>As a not-for-profit company, we can afford to do things differently. AI Search uses smaller, more efficient models, and we avoid energy-heavy features like video generation altogether. </p><h2 id="ai-that-answers-to-the-planet">AI that answers to the planet</h2><p>Reducing AI’s footprint isn’t enough — we’re here to make a positive impact. That’s why we generate more renewable energy than our AI features use, from 100% clean sources like solar and wind.</p><p>We’ve invested €18M in renewable energy projects — expanding solar parks and adding clean power to the grid. The energy we generate helps displace fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.</p><p>We use tools like the <a href="https://huggingface.co/AIEnergyScore"><u>AI Energy Score</u></a> and <a href="https://ecologits.ai/latest/"><u>Ecologits</u></a> to select efficient models and track their energy use — keeping our process transparent, and ourselves accountable.</p><h2 id="your-data-stays-yours">Your data stays yours</h2><p>Our new features respect your privacy as much as they respect the planet. We collect only what’s necessary to deliver a great product, and not a byte more.</p><p>Earlier this year, we launched an independent <a href="https://blog.ecosia.org/launching-our-european-search-index/"><u>European search index</u></a>, which already powers AI Overviews and some of our search results. Building our own infrastructure gives us more control over the technology, so we can make it greener and more privacy-friendly.</p><p>Unlike Big Tech, we don’t run email, maps, or payment platforms, so we couldn’t piece together your life even if we wanted to. That’s not our business, and it never will be. As a European company, we’re bound by strict privacy laws like the GDPR, which means your data stays yours.</p><p>AI shouldn’t come at the cost of privacy. After all, we’re here for the trees, not your data.</p><h2 id="for-people-and-the-planet">For people and the planet</h2><p>We’re learning as we go, and we’d love your thoughts along the way. Tell us what works, what doesn’t, and what you’d like to see next at <a href="mailto:AI.feedback@ecosia.org"><u>AI.feedback@ecosia.org</u></a>. Together, we can shape a future that’s not just more intelligent, but kinder, too. It’s the smartest thing to do.</p>
