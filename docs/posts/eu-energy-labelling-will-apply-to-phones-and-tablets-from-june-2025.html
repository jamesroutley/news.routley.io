    <h1>EU Energy labelling will apply to phones and tablets from June 2025</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <div><p>Ecodesign requirements will apply to smartphones, feature phones, cordless phones and slate tablets placed on the EU market <strong>from 20 June 2025 onwards</strong>. Energy Labelling requirements will apply from the same date for smartphones and slate tablets. These rules do not apply to tablet computers, to products with flexible main display (roll-up), and to smartphones for high security communication.</p><p>The regulations focus on measures to extend product lifetime (reparability, upgradability, battery life). The increase in average lifetime, e.g. from 3.0 to 4.1 years for a mid-range smartphone, implies a decrease in annual sales, with the same stock. </p><p><strong>Cordless phones</strong> use a landline telecommunications network. A base station forms a radio interface between the network connection (telephone line) and the cordless handset(s). The cradle to recharge the handset can be integrated in the base station or separate. Base station and charging cradle are (continuously) connected to the mains power supply through a power adapter (= external power supply).</p><p><strong>Smartphones and feature phones</strong> use a cellular telecommunications or satellite based network. Feature phones are the first generation mobile phones, not used for internet services, and without the possibility to install third-party Apps. Smartphones have an integrated touch screen between 4 and 7 inch size.</p><p><strong>Slate tablets</strong> have a screen size from 7 to 17.4 inch. They do not have a physically attached keyboard and use an operating system similar to that of smartphones (e.g. IOS, Android). This distinguishes them from tablet computers, that typically use an operating system similar to a desktop computer or notebook (e.g. Windows) and have a (detachable) keyboard. The EIA accounts tablet computers under personal computers.</p><p><em><sup>Source: estimations from the </sup></em><a href="https://circabc.europa.eu/ui/group/418195ae-4919-45fa-a959-3b695c9aab28/library/e2a752ef-c365-41df-8e50-98376e6ca756/details"><em><sup>Ecodesign Impact Accounting Overview Report 2024</sup></em></a></p></div>
