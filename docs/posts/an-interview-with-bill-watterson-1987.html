<h3>The creator of <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>
<p>on cartooning, syndicates, <i>Garfield</i>, Charles Schulz, and 
 editors.<br/></p></h3>
</center>

<i>When</i> Calvin and Hobbes <i>hit the nation&#39;s funny pages in 
 late 1985, it took everybody by surprise. A literate comic 
 strip? By a guy who can draw? About a kid who acts like a real 
 kid? And it&#39;s funny? And it&#39;s from a major syndicate!? The 
 cognoscenti of the graphic narrative form thought they&#39;d died 
 and gone to comic strip heaven.

</i><p><i>But its true. Against heavy odds, one man with a lot of 
 determination and a fierce sense of his craft may have 
 single-handedly given the strips a new lease on their artistic 
 life. It&#39;s been a struggle, but Bill Watterson, like his 
 creation, is the real thing at last.</i>

</p><p>
<b>Andrew Christie:</b> Let&#39;s start with the basics: when, where, 
 why, and how?

</p><p>
<b>Bill Watterson:</b> Well, I don&#39;t know how far back you want 
 to go; I&#39;ve been interested in cartooning all my life. I read 
 the comics as a kid, and I did cartoons for high school 
 publications -- the newspaper and yearbook and such. In college, 
 I got interested in political cartooning and did political 
 cartoons every week for four years at Kenyon College in Gambier, 
 Ohio, and majored in political science there.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> All in Ohio?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yes. I grew up in Chagrin Falls, Ohio.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> What kind of time frame are we talking about?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> I was born in 1958; we moved to Chagrin when I 
 was 6, so from the first grade on, really. My whole childhood was 
 in Chagrin Falls. Right after I graduated from Kenyon, I was 
 offered a job at the <i>Cincinnati Post</i> as their editorial 
 cartoonist in a trial six month arrangement. The agreement was 
 that they could fire me or I could quit with no questions asked 
 if things didn&#39;t work out during the first few months. Sure 
 enough, things didn&#39;t work out, and they fired me, no questions 
 asked.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> What was the problem?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> To this day, I&#39;m not completely sure. My guess 
 is that the editor wanted his own Jeff MacNelly (a Pulitzer 
 winner at 24), and I didn&#39;t live up to his expectations. My 
 Cincinnati days were pretty Kafkaesque. I had lived there all 
 of two weeks, and the editor insisted that most of my work be 
 about local, as opposed to national, issues. Cincinnati has a 
 weird, three-party, city manager-government, and by the time I 
 figured it out, I was standing in the unemployment lines. I didn&#39;t 
 hit the ground running. Cincinnati at that time was also beginning 
 to realize it had major cartooning talent in Jim Borgman, at the 
 city&#39;s other paper, and I didn&#39;t benefit from the comparison.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> I&#39;m not familiar...

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> He&#39;s syndicated through King Features, and had 
 been for a couple years by the time I arrived in Cincinnati. This 
 is an odd story. Borgman graduated from Kenyon College the year 
 before I went there, and it was his example that inspired me to 
 pursue political cartooning. He had drawn cartoons at Kenyon, and 
 landed his job at the <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i> right after 
 graduation. His footsteps seemed like good ones to follow, so I 
 cultivated an interest in politics, and Borgman helped me a lot in 
 learning how to construct an editorial cartoon. Neither of us 
 dreamed I&#39;d end up in the same town on the opposite paper. I don&#39;t 
 know to what extent the comparison played a role in my editor&#39;s 
 not liking my work, but I was very intimidated by working on a 
 major city paper and I didn&#39;t feel free to experiment, really, or 
 to travel down my own path. I very early caught on that the editor 
 had something specific in mind that he was looking for, and I tried 
 to accommodate him in order to get published. His idea was that he 
 was going to publish only my very best work so that I wouldn&#39;t 
 embarress the newspaper while I learned the ropes. As sound as 
 that idea may be from the management standpoint, it was 
 disastrous for me because I was only getting a couple cartoons 
 a week printed.  I would turn out rough idea after rough idea, and 
 he would veto eighty percent of them. As a result I lost all 
 my self-confidence, and his intervention was really unhealthy, I 
 think, as far as letting me experiment and make mistakes, and 
 become a stronger cartoonist for it. Obviously, if he wanted a 
 more experienced cartoonist, he shouldn&#39;t have hired a kid just 
 out of college. I pretty much prostituted myself for six months 
 but I couldn&#39;t please him, so he sent me packing.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Well, it was mercifully brief, then.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yeah, in a way it was; and actually, I think the 
 experience-- now, in hindsight -- was probably a good thing. It 
 forced me to consider how interested I was in political cartooning. 
 After I was fired, I applied to other papers but political 
 cartooning, like all cartooning, is a very tough field to break 
 into. Newspapers are very reluctant to hire their own cartoonists 
 when they can get Oliphant or MacNelly through syndication for a 
 twentieth of the price.

</p><p>
So I wasn&#39;t having any luck getting accepted anyway and it forced 
 me to re-examine what it was that I really wanted to do. In my 
 experience in political cartooning, I was never one of those 
 people who reads the headlines and foams at the mouth with rabid 
 opinion that I&#39;ve just got to get down on paper. I&#39;m interested 
 in the issues but...I don&#39;t know...I guess I just don&#39;t have the 
 killer instinct that I think makes a great political cartoonist. 
 I&#39;d always enjoyed the comics more, and felt that as long as I 
 was unemployed it would be a good chance to pursue that and see 
 what response I could get from a syndicate, as I didn&#39;t have 
 anything to lose at that point. So I drew up a comic strip -- this 
 was in 1980 -- and sent it off and got rejected. I continued that 
 for five years with different comic strip examples &#39;til 
 finally <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> came together. But it&#39;s been a 
 long road.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Were you submitting different strips to different 
 syndicates, or did you go after one syndicate?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> I didn&#39;t know a lot then -- and don&#39;t know a lot 
 now -- as to what the best way to do this is, but my procedure 
 was I would draw up the submission -- a month&#39;s worth of strips, 
 made to look as professional as I could, and send copies to the 
 five major syndicates, and then just sit around and wait for 
 their rejection letters. I would then try to see if I could 
 second guess them or imagine what they were looking for that 
 I could put in my next submission and gradually get a more 
 marketable comic strip. In hindsight, as I say, I&#39;m not convinced 
 that that&#39;s the best way to go about it. Trying to please the 
 syndicates was pretty much the same as what I had ended up doing 
 at the <i>Cincinnati Post</i>, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the way 
 to draw your best material. You should stick with what you enjoy, 
 what you find funny -- that&#39;s the humor that will be the strongest, 
 and that will transmit itself. Rather then trying to find out what 
 the latest trend is, you should draw what is personally interesting.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> So after five years you just quit doing what you&#39;d 
 been doing and did what you wanted to do?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> It was a slow process, and actually what happened 
 is another odd coincidence. One of the strips I&#39;d sent had 
 Calvin and Hobbes as minor characters. Calvin was the little 
 brother of the strip&#39;s main character, and Hobbes was like he is 
 now, a stuffed tiger that came to life in Calvin&#39;s imagination. 
 One of the syndicates suggested that these two characters were the 
 strongest and why didn&#39;t I develop a strip around them? I had 
 thought they were the funniest characters myself, but I was 
 unsure as to whether they could hold their own strip. I was afraid 
 that maybe the key to their wackiness was the contrast between 
 them and the more normal characters in the rest of the strip. I 
 wasn&#39;t sure Calvin and Hobbes would be able to maintain that 
 intensity on their own. But I tried it, and almost immediately it 
 clicked in my mind; it became much easier to write material. Their 
 personalities expanded easily, and that takes a good 75 percent of 
 the work out of it. If you have the personalities down, you 
 understand them and identify with them; you can stick them in any 
 situation and have a pretty good idea of how they&#39;re going to 
 respond. Then it&#39;s just a matter of sanding and polishing up the 
 jokes. But if you&#39;ve got more ambiguous characters or stock 
 stereotypes, the plastic comes through and they don&#39;t work as 
 well. These two characters clicked for me almost immediately and 
 I feel very comfortable working with them. That syndicate, oddly 
 enough, declined my strip, so I started sending it around. 
 Universal expressed an interest in it and wanted to see more work, 
 so I drew another month&#39;s worth of art, sent that to them, and 
 they decided to take it.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b>That&#39;s rather ironic: The syndicate that suggested 
 you bring out those two characters rejected the strip?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yeah.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Who was this?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Well, if you want to rub their noses in it, it 
 was United Features. I was sort of mystified when they rejected 
 the strip. They had given me a development contract, which meant 
 I was to work exclusively with them and rather than completing 
 everything on my own and turning it in to them and having it 
 rejected or accepted, I was working much more directly with the 
 syndicate, turning in smaller batches much more frequently, and 
 getting comments on them. The idea was that they would help me 
 develop the strip and then, assuming that they liked it, it would 
 flow into a normal contract for syndication. I&#39;m not sure exactly 
 what happened; I gather that the sales staff didn&#39;t have much 
 enthusiasm for it, I don&#39;t know--but apparently they couldn&#39;t 
 convince enough people there in high places.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> I would guess, and I don&#39;t know if you share this 
 opinion, but there is probably considerable resistance to a strip 
 that doesn&#39;t have a lot of immediate, apparent marketing 
 potential.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> I think United really looks for the marketing 
 more than some of the other syndicates, and they saw Hobbes as 
 having marketing potential, so I don&#39;t think that was it. I was 
 later offered the chance to incorporate Robotman into my strip. 
 There they had envisioned a character as a product--toylines, 
 television show, everything--and they wanted a strip written 
 around the character. They thought that maybe I could stick it 
 in my strip, working with Calvin&#39;s imagination or something. They 
 didn&#39;t really care too how much I did it, just so long as the 
 character remained intact and would be a very major character...And 
 I turned them down. It really went against my idea of what a comic 
 strip should be. I&#39;m not interested in slamming United Features 
 here. Keep in mind that at the time, it was the only syndicate 
 that had expressed any interest in my work. I remain grateful 
 for their early attention. But there&#39;s a professional issue here. 
 They told me that if I was to insert Robotman into my strip, they 
 would reconsider it, and because the licensing was already in 
 production, my strip would stand a better chance of being 
 accepted. Not knowing if <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> would ever go 
 anywhere, it was difficult to turn down another chance at 
 syndication. But I really recoiled at the idea of drawing 
 somebody else&#39;s character. It&#39;s cartooning by committee, and I 
 have a moral problem with that. It&#39;s not art then.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> I&#39;ve never heard of anything like that before.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yea, well, I think it&#39;s really a crass way to 
 go about it--the Saturday morning cartoons do that now, where they 
 develop the toy and then draw the cartoon around it, and the 
 result is the cartoon is a commercial for the toy and the toy is 
 a commercial for the cartoon. The same thing&#39;s happening now in 
 comic strips; it&#39;s just another way to get the competitive edge. 
 You saturate all the different markets and allow each other to 
 advertise the other, and it&#39;s the best of all possible worlds. 
 You can see the financial incentive to work that way. I just think 
 it&#39;s to the detriment of integrity in comic strip art.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> It may be good business but it would be unfortunate 
 to see that catch on.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yeah, I don&#39;t have a lot of respect for that.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Well, enough of this depressing stuff; let&#39;s talk 
 about <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i>.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Okay.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Is there a Calvin?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> A real one? No.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Is he in some way autobiographical?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Not really. Hobbes might be a little closer to 
 me in terms of personality, with Calvin being more energetic, 
 brash, always looking for life on the edge. He lives entirely 
 in the present, and whatever he can do to make that moment more 
 exciting he&#39;ll just let fly...and I&#39;m really not like that at all.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> You manage a lot of complex shifts between fantasy 
 and reality; between Hobbes as a stuffed tiger and a real-life 
 playmate. He&#39;s frequently involved in what is apparently the real 
 world, doing real things together with Calvin that he couldn&#39;t 
 possibly be doing. Do you think that kind of thing out in advance 
 or does it just come to you when the gag calls for it?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Could you name something specifically? I&#39;m not 
 sure I follow.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Well, when they&#39;re driving down the mountain in 
 their wagon and flying all over the place. You think, after 
 reading the first few strips, that you&#39;ve got the idea; that this 
 is a stuffed tiger and when he and Calvin are alone he becomes 
 real--to Calvin--but then, obviously, when they&#39;re doing things 
 like that in the real world, he has to be more than fantasy.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yeah, it&#39;s a strange metamorphosis. I hate to 
 subject it to too much analysis, but one thing I have fun with is 
 the rarity of things being shown from an adult&#39;s perspective. When 
 Hobbes is a stuffed toy in one panel and alive in the next, I&#39;m 
 juxtaposing the &#34;grown-up&#34; version of reality with Calvin&#39;s 
 version, and inviting the reader to decide which is truer. Most 
 of the time, the strip is drawn simply from Calvin&#39;s perspective, 
 and Hobbes is as real as anyone. So when Calvin is careening down 
 the hillside, I don&#39;t feel compelled to insert reminders that 
 Hobbes is a stuffed toy. I try to get the reader completely swept 
 up into Calvin&#39;s world by ignoring adult perspective. Hobbes, 
 therefore, isn&#39;t just a cute gimmick. I&#39;m not making the strip 
 revolve around the transformation. The viewpoint of the strip 
 fluctuates, and this allows Hobbes to be a &#34;real&#34; character.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> It has a lunatic internal consistency.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yeah, I guess that&#39;s the best way of putting it.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Are you familiar with <i>Krazy Kat</i>?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yes! I love it; I wish I thought that that kind 
 of work were possible today.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Well, it sounds like it is. George Herriman didn&#39;t 
 need to justify his reality, either.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yeah, I agree on that point. I mean the bizarre 
 dialect, the constantly changing backgrounds...In the first place, 
 I don&#39;t know who would put enough energy into their work anymore 
 to do something like that; secondly, and probably more 
 importantly, comic strips are being printed at such a ridiculous 
 size that elimination of dialogue and linework is almost a 
 necessity and you just can&#39;t get that kind of depth. I think 
 of <i>Pogo</i>, another strip that had tremendous dialogue and 
 fantastic backgrounds...Those strips were just complete worlds 
 that the reader would be sucked into. For a few moments a day we 
 could live in Coconino County; the whole thing was entirely there. 
 The dialogue was part of it, the backgrounds were part of it, the 
 characters were off-beat...and you need a little space and time 
 to develop that sort of thing. I know for a fact that nobody&#39;s 
 doing it now and I don&#39;t know that anybody will do it. Garry 
 Trudeau is the only cartoonist with the clout to get his strip 
 published large enough to accomodate extended dialogue. It&#39;s a 
 shame.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Well, let&#39;s talk about your peers for a bit.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> You&#39;re gonna get me in trouble.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> No, no; you can say anything you want.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yeah, that&#39;s what&#39;s going to get me into trouble.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> What about Gary Larson?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> I really like the lunacy of <i>The Far Side</i>. 
 It&#39;s a one-panel strip so it&#39;s a slightly different animal than a 
 four-panel strip like mine. I don&#39;t really compare one-panel 
 strips to four-panels strips because there are different 
 opportunities with each. Larson&#39;s working with one picture and a 
 handful of words, and given that, I think he&#39;s one of the most 
 inventive guys in comics. The four-panel strip has more potential 
 for storyline and character involvement than just a single panel. 
 But I do enjoy his stuff alot.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> What about Jim Davis?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Uh...<i>Garfield</i> 
 is...(long pause)...consistent.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Ooo-kay...

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> <i>U.S. Acres</i> I think is an abomination.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Never seen it.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Lucky you. Jim Davis has his factory in Indiana 
 cranking out this strip about a pig on a farm. I find it an insult 
 to the intelligence, though it&#39;s very successful.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Most insults to the intelligence are. Well, how 
 about the old school, are they holding up their end at all? Johnny 
 Hart? Charles Schulz...?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> That&#39;s an interesting question. I have a 
 tremendous amount of respect for <i>Peanuts</i>. Every now and 
 then I hear that <i>Peanuts</i> isn&#39;t as funny as it was or it&#39;s 
 gotten old or something like that. I think what&#39;s really happened 
 is that Schulz, in <i>Peanuts</i>, changed the entire face of 
 comic strips, and everybody has now caught up to him. I don&#39;t 
 think he&#39;s five years ahead of everybody else like he used to 
 be, so that&#39;s taken some of the edge off it. I think it&#39;s still 
 a wonderful strip in terms of solid construction, character 
 development, the fantasy element...Things that we now take for 
 granted--reading the thoughts of an animal for example--there&#39;s 
 not a cartoonist who&#39;s done anything since 1960 who doesn&#39;t owe 
 Schulz a tremendous debt. Johnny Hart; I admire the simplicity, 
 the way he&#39;s gotten that strip down to the bare essentials; there&#39;s 
 nothing extraneous in the drawing, and the humor is very spartan. 
 It doesn&#39;t grab me, though, because I look for real involvement 
 with characters, and the characters in <i>B.C.</i> are pretty much 
 interchangeable; they&#39;re props for humor. I think his style of 
 humor is mostly in words, not in the characters. I look to strips 
 like <i>Peanuts</i>, where you&#39;re really involved with the 
 characters, you feel that you know them. Iguess that&#39;s why I don&#39;t 
 enjoy <i>B.C.</i> quite as much. It&#39;s better than many, though.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> A lot of golf jokes.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yeah, yeah. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s hard to knock a 
 strip that bangs out a solid joke every day, but I&#39;d like to think 
 more comic strips could be pushing the boundaries. A lot of comic 
 characters are flat and predictable, and a lot of jokes are no 
 more than stupid puns. For most readers, sure, that passes the 
 mustard, but it certainly doesn&#39;t take full advantage of a 
 remarkably versatile medium. I&#39;d like to see cartoonists measuring 
 their work by higher standards than how many papers their strips 
 are in and how much money they make. With four panels, the 
 cartoonist has the opportunity to develop characters and 
 storylines. It can be like writing a novel in daily installments. 
 That&#39;s where the potential of the medium is, and I see very few 
 cartoonists taking advantage of it. <i>Peanuts</i> does it. 
 <i>Bloom County</i>, <i>Doonesbury</i>, and <i>For Better Or For 
 Worse</i> and others, and that&#39;s more or less it. These strips 
 have heart, and an involvement with the characters, so that they&#39;re 
 more than just props to relate a gag. We read about them and sort 
 of go through their life with them. I think that&#39;s taking the 
 strip to a deeper and more significant level. The strips I admire 
 go farther than a gag a day, and take us into a special world.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Would it be the accurate to call Charles Schulz the 
 major influence on you?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Oh yeah. As a child, especially, 
 <i>Peanuts</i> and <i>Pogo</i> were my two biggest influences.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Did you ever see any of Percy Crosby&#39;s 
 <i>Skippy</i>?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> No, never did.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> There are some interesting similarities.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> I&#39;ve had a couple of people write in comparing 
 my work to <i>Barnaby</i> by Crockett Johnson, and that&#39;s another 
 strip I&#39;ve never seen. Or rather, with both of those I think I&#39;ve 
 seen one or two strips in anthologies, but I&#39;ve never seen the 
 work at any length.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> I believe Dover is reprinting two books worth of 
 <i>Barnaby</i> in the next few months. That would be worth your 
 picking up. Also <i>Harold and the Magic Crayon</i>.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> I remember that. The drawings don&#39;t interest 
 me a great deal, but I should look it up just to see what the 
 fuss is about.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Do you see yourself doing this forever?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> I&#39;d like to, yeah, if the market will bear it.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> exclusively?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yeah, I&#39;m really enjoying the work. I feel that 
 the characters have a lot of potential. I&#39;d like to have the 
 opportunity to draw this strip for years and see where it goes. 
 It&#39;s sort of a scary thing now to imagine; these cartoonists who&#39;ve 
 been drawing a strip for twenty years. I can&#39;t imagine coming up 
 with that much material. If I just take it day by day, though, 
 it&#39;s a lot of fun, and I do think I have a long way to go before 
 I&#39;ve exhausted the possibilities.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Do you think you&#39;ll ever need a ghost?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> No, that&#39;s against what I believe about comic 
 strips. In fact, I&#39;d go even further and say I don&#39;t think a strip 
 should ever be continued after the death or retirement of a 
 cartoonist.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Well, you know, a lot of the very good ones used 
 assistants.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yeah, <i>Pogo</i> did. Schulz has a good comment 
 on that: &#34;It&#39;s like Arnold Palmer having someone to hit his chip 
 shots.&#34; I spent five years trying to get this stupid job and now 
 that I have it I&#39;m not going to hire it out to somebody else. The 
 whole pleasure for me is having the opportunity to do a comic 
 strip for a living, and now that I&#39;ve finally got that I&#39;m not 
 going to give it away. It also gives me complete creative control. 
 Any time somebody else has their hand in the ink it&#39;s changing 
 the product, and I enjoy the responsibility for this product. I&#39;m 
 willing to take the blame if the strip goes down the drain, and I 
 want the credit if it succeeds. So long as it has my name on it, 
 I want it to be mine. I don&#39;t know, if you don&#39;t have that kind 
 of investment in it...I guess that&#39;s the difference between looking 
 at it as an art and looking at it as a job. I&#39;m not interested in 
 setting up an assembly line to produce this thing more efficiently. 
 There are certainly people who could letter the strip better than 
 I do; I don&#39;t enjoy lettering very much, but that&#39;s the way I write 
 and that belongs in the strip because the strip is a reflection 
 of me. If cartoonists would look at this more as an art than as 
 a part time job or a get-rich-quick scheme, I think comics overall 
 would be better. I think there&#39;s a tremendous potential to be 
 tapped.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Speaking of creative control, do you ever have 
 a problem with an editor or the syndicate sending a strip back 
 and saying you&#39;re using big words, or you&#39;re getting political...?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Universal is really good about that. I send in 
 roughs to the syndicate, which they okay or veto. If the rough is 
 okayed, I ink it up. I understand this arrangement will continue 
 for the first year or two while I get on my feet. Unlike the other 
 places I&#39;ve worked, though, Universal seems to have some basic 
 respect for what I&#39;m trying to do. Sometimes they&#39;ll axe a strip 
 idea I kind of liked--that&#39;s inevitable when you judge something 
 as subjective as humor--but they&#39;re not altering things, or telling 
 me what to do instead. Either a joke is okay as I have it, or it&#39;s 
 rejected, and I&#39;ve never argued about a decision yet. At the other 
 syndicate, I&#39;d hear, &#34;this is funny, but it&#39;s too wordy,&#34; or 
 &#34;simplify the drawings.&#34; That&#39;s interfering with the craft. And 
 if you give a little credit to the concept of the artist, I think 
 you ought to indulge excesses a bit, because that reflects the 
 personality of the writer. Now if a joke is in bad taste or it&#39;s 
 not funny, okay, that&#39;s a whole different thing, but how you craft 
 a joke is really what the writer&#39;s job is, and I don&#39;t think that 
 technique should be subject to any editorial constraints, and 
 Universal has been tremendous about that.

<b>Christie:</b> So you actually have to draw up more than seven 
 strips a week?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Yeah...unless they&#39;re all really great.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> How much time do you put in?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> I&#39;ve never really measured it out. Obviously the 
 great thing about this job is the complete freedom of the schedule.
 So long as I meet the deadline, they don&#39;t care when I work or 
 how I work. Sometimes I work all day if I&#39;m under a crunch; I 
 take a day off here and there if I have something else pressing 
 or if I&#39;m just tired of what I&#39;m doing...so I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve 
 never sat down to quantify how many hours I actually spend on 
 the strip. I use the deadlines to estimate my progress; each 
 month I know that I have to produce so many strips, and by the 
 end of the month I&#39;ll make sure that I have.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> When you sit down at the drawing table, though, 
 do you do one at a time or just keep going?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> I write separately from the inking up. I&#39;m sure 
 this varies from cartoonist to cartoonist; I find that the writing 
 is the hard part and the drawing is the fun part. I like to 
 separate the two so I can give my full attention to one or the 
 other. Writing it, I&#39;ll sit down and stare into space for an hour 
 and sometimes not come up with a single decent idea, or sometimes 
 no idea at all, and it&#39;s very tempting to go do something else or 
 just draw up a strip, but I find that if I make myself stick to 
 it for another hour I can sometimes come up with several good 
 ideas. And when I get to the drawing, I really enjoy taking a 
 big chunk of time and working on the drawing and nothing else. 
 That allows me to make sure that I&#39;m really challenging the art, 
 making each picture as interesting as I can...stick in a close-up 
 or an odd perspective. This way, the writing doesn&#39;t distract me 
 while I&#39;m drawing and vice versa. I can devote my full attention 
 to each.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> Is that original artwork available to your 
 admirers? Say, people who interview you for prestigious national 
 magazines?

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> No, I&#39;ve decided not to sell or give any of it 
 out. Don&#39;t feel slighted.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> No, no. I would only make such a request because 
 in my opinion, and in the opinion of just about everybody I know, 
 what you&#39;re doing is the best stuff in the papers.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Thank you very much; it&#39;s gratifying to hear 
 that from people who care about comic art. I never know what to 
 make of it when someone writes to say, &#34;<i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> 
 is the best strip in the paper. I like it even more than 
 <i>Nancy</i>.&#34; Ugh.

</p><p>
<b>Christie:</b> That&#39;s Andy Warhol&#39;s favorite strip.

</p><p>
<b>Watterson:</b> Oh, well, that would figure. Maybe he&#39;s the 
 nut writing me.
