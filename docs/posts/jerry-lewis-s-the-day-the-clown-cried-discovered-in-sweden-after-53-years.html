Hearing this, Wachsberger threatened to sue Lewis for breach of contract, which resulted in a fallout between the two that caused Lewis to leave with a rough cut of the film, according to a 2018 feature in <i>The New York Times.</i></p><p id="el-21-N7PHIBCFE5D77FCB3E74WKAFVI">Lewis had mixed feelings about the film, showing fragments of his footage to close friends. However, in his 1982 autobiography, Lewis said “the picture must be seen”.</p><div id="el-22-XG4SDP7YJZGFJJ3L75JCPD7G5E"><figure><picture><source width="800" height="1200" media="(min-width: 1024px)" srcset="https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/XG4SDP7YJZGFJJ3L75JCPD7G5E.jpg?smart=true&amp;auth=1184b9a1d6e572d7bbeb8eaeaf5d9cb85b539359fff54ef9a28d0def0a831bd8&amp;width=800&amp;height=1200"/><source width="600" height="900" media="(min-width: 768px)" srcset="https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/XG4SDP7YJZGFJJ3L75JCPD7G5E.jpg?smart=true&amp;auth=1184b9a1d6e572d7bbeb8eaeaf5d9cb85b539359fff54ef9a28d0def0a831bd8&amp;width=600&amp;height=900"/><source width="400" height="600" media="(min-width: 350px)" srcset="https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/XG4SDP7YJZGFJJ3L75JCPD7G5E.jpg?smart=true&amp;auth=1184b9a1d6e572d7bbeb8eaeaf5d9cb85b539359fff54ef9a28d0def0a831bd8&amp;width=400&amp;height=600"/><img _id="XG4SDP7YJZGFJJ3L75JCPD7G5E" type="image" originalwidth="2048" originalheight="3072" alt="No complete copy of The Day The Clown Cried has ever been confirmed to exist until now.
