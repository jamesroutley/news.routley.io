                <p>Italo Calvino had prescient ideas about computer created literature <a href="https://www.jfki.fu-berlin.de/academics/SummerSchool/Dateien2011/Reading_Assignments/iuli_reader2.pdf">in 1967</a>. Experimental literature and literary criticism were all about formalisms, so it made sense to think about computer programs carrying on the work of writers. I wonder when we will get a writing AI that “turns its own codes completely upside down”!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Having laid down these procedures and entrusted a computer with the task of carrying out these operations, will we have a machine capable of replacing the poet and the author? Just as we already have machines that can read, machines that perform a linguistic analysis of literary texts, machines that make translations and summaries, will we also have machines capable of conceiving and composing poems
and novels?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>What would be the style of a literary automaton? I believe that its true vocation would be for classicism. The test of a poetic-electronic machine would be its ability to produce traditional works, poems with closed metrical forms, novels that follow all the rules.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The true literature machine will be one that itself feels the need to produce disorder, as a reaction against its preceding production of order: a machine that will produce avant-garde work to free its circuits when they are choked by too long a production of classicism. In fact, given that developments in cybernetics lean toward machines capable of learning, of changing their own programs, of developing their own sensibilities and their own needs, nothing prevents us from foreseeing a literature-machine that at a certain point feels unsatisfied with its own traditionalism and starts to propose new ways of writing,  turning its own codes completely upside down.</p>
