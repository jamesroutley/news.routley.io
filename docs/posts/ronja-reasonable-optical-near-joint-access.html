<h2>What is Ronja?</h2>
<p>Ronja (Reasonable Optical Near Joint Access) is an User Controlled Technology (like
Free Software) project of optical point-to-point data link. The device
has 1.4km range and has stable 10Mbps full duplex data rate. Ronja is an
optoelectronic device you can mount on your house and connect your PC,
home or office network with other networks. Or you can use it as a general
purpose wireless link for building any other networking project.</p>

<p>The design is released under the GNU Free Documentation License: you get all
the necessary documentation and construction guides free. The material costs
are very low, about 100 USD.  The operation is immune to interference and quite
reliable - interrupted only by <a href="http://ronja.twibright.com/reliable.php">dense fog.</a></p>

<h2>User Approach</h2>
<p>Output of Ronja project is a design. Twibright Labs&#39; intent is not to
manufacture and sell pieces of hardware, but to solely engage in the
development. Manufacture and selling parts and kits is meant to be performed by
other entities, without explicit licensing requirements.  This is intended to
guard the user against overpricing. Moreover, the freely available complete
source code and building guide helps the user to have transparent control
over quality of the goods he is buying.

</p><p>If you are interested in the device, then visit the homepage, buy components
and make the device yourself. The homepage is mostly a building guide exactly
describing how to do it.  If you run into troubles following the guides, there
is an end-user-oriented support provided in the form of mailing list.</p>

<h2>The device</h2>

<p>One Ronja device is a single long-distance optical transceiver that is
capable of running against the same or compatible device on the other side of
the link. The topology is point-to-point.</p>

<p>Building a Ronja is rather lenghty job (this will hopefully change in
future) that however pays off in a reliable and performant device that is
capable of delivering steady connectivity with little maintenance and can be
run freely without a need of authorities&#39; approval.  Also a possibility of
interference and eavesdropping is negligible. Dropouts are infrequent and determined
solely by weather and are thus foreseeable.</p>

<p>He who wants to enjoy the adrenaline sport of driving primitive retail parts
into flawless coopertaion to provide the uncurbed fullduplex connectivity
experience must withstand these nuisances:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ronja is somewhat labour expensive. Things have been made much easier by
putting the most complicated electronics on a PCB. The cost of parts is
negligible in comparison with the labour, for example the components for the
whole Ronja 10M Metropolis cost just 1500CZK. Further reduction in labour
demands is planned by putting RX and TX on PCB too.</li>
<li>The user must possess certain basic manual skills as soldering, drilling,
painting, and technical drawing/schematic reading. But people without
any previous experience with soldering have built a piece that worked on
the first try!</li>
<li>The user must not cut the corners during the building</li>
</ul>

<p>but there are also certain conveniences:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parts were chosen to be of the widest availability possible and
equivalents are provided where applicable</li>
<li>Innovative approach is used to speed up the work and make it convenient.
Sector codes are present to make the population easy. Drilling is simplified
by drilling templates - just print and no measurement is necessary in the
workshop!
</li><li>The device is based on the KISS rule (Keep It Simple, Stupid) which makes
the device plug-and-play immediately after the building provided the user
hasn&#39;t botched anything.</li>
<li>The design is rugged and overdimensioned to withstand variations in the
components. As a consequence, the resulting device is rock solid in steady
performance and provides outstanding electromagnetic intereference immunity and
electromagnetic compatibility. Withstands -20Â°C as well as direct sunlight
and heat with obvious margin.
During a lightning storm, lightning strike in proximity usually doesn&#39;t
generate even a single lost bit.</li>
<li>In case of device failure (direct lightning strike), the measuring points
can be inspected and bad components replaced without a need to throw the whole
device out.</li> </ul>
