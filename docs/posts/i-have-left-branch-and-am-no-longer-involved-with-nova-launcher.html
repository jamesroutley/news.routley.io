        <p>Hi everyone,</p>
        
        <p>I&#39;m the founder and original developer of Nova Launcher. I&#39;ve been the only one working on Nova for the past year. I needed to let you know that I have left Branch and am no longer involved with Nova Launcher.</p>
        
        <p>For the past several months I have been preparing the Open Source release of Nova Launcher. This work included cleaning up the codebase, reviewing licenses, removing or replacing proprietary code, and coordinating with legal to ensure a proper release. When Branch acquired Nova in 2022, Branch then-CEO and founder Alex Austin made several public commitments to the community about Nova&#39;s future, including statements about open sourcing:</p>

        <div><p>
            &#34;Thanks for the suggestion! I&#39;ll bring it up with Kevin but ultimately [releasing the source code] is his call.&#34;
            </p>
        </div>



        <div><p>
            &#34;If Kevin were to ever leave, it&#39;s contracted that the code will be open sourced and put in the hands of the community.&#34;
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>However I was ultimately asked to stop working on Nova Launcher and the open sourcing effort.</p>
        
        <p>Nova Launcher has been an incredible project and has an incredible community. I&#39;m grateful for the years of support, feedback, and enthusiasm.</p>
