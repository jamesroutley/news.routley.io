						<span>How are monthly contributions calculated?</span>
						<p>
							The monthly contributions are determined by combining the Patreon amount with the total received within a 30-day period from Paypal donations. Please note that this is an estimation and may not be entirely precise due to fees and currency conversions.
						</p>

						<span>How can I display my name in the credits?</span>
						<p>
							We are currently working on the account system, so if you want to be credited, please send us an email to <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#670408091306041327000803081349010812090306130e0809"><span data-cfemail="f3909c9d87929087b3949c979c87dd959c869d9792879a9c9d">[email protected]</span></a> with your Paypal email address and the information required based on your current level. It could be a name or a company name, and a link to your website.

						<span>I just subscribed, why didn&#39;t the fund amount go up?</span>
						<p>
							There is a delay between the moment you subscribe and the moment your contribution is processed. We are working on a update to make this process faster in the future. In the meantime, please be patient and check back in a few hours.

						<span>Why not Patreon?</span>
						<p>
							Patreon has played a crucial role in our journey so far; however, as our project&#39;s needs continue to expand, its scalability is becoming a challenge. Additionally, the combination of Patreon&#39;s fees and VAT charges on donations results in a significant portion of your contributions being lost in the process. By transitioning to our own platform, we will achieve greater independence and ensure that every penny you donate directly fuels the improvement of the Godot Engine.

						<span>How can I cancel my monthly contribution?</span>
						<p>
							To cancel your PayPal membership you have to go to your <a href="https://www.paypal.com/myaccount" target="_blank">PayPal profile</a> and cancel the subscription. If you have any issues, please send us an email to <a href="https://fund.godotengine.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#492a26273d282a3d092e262d263d672f263c272d283d202627"><span data-cfemail="9af9f5f4eefbf9eedafdf5fef5eeb4fcf5eff4fefbeef3f5f4">[email protected]</span></a>.
