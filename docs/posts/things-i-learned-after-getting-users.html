    <h1>Things I learned after getting users</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>last month, i posted about my website <a href="https://basementcommunity.com" target="_blank">basement community</a> on hacker news and it sorta blew up. you can <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34826085" target="_blank">view the post here</a>. it blew up so much, i was totally unprepared for what came with all that traffic, so without further ado, here are 4 things i learned running a website with mostly user-generated content:</p>
<h2 id="1-someone-is-going-to-abuse-your-site">1. someone is going to abuse your site</h2>
<p>this one may sound pretty obvious. you may have heard about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" target="_blank">XSS attacks</a> or maybe even stories of people <a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/gain-ssh-access-servers-by-brute-forcing-credentials-0194263/" target="_blank">brute forcing their way into production servers</a> but what i&#39;m talking about is an attack that you might not even consider when running a social media site: dumb-ass people being really obnoxious</p>
<p>when the site first got a surge of users from hacker news, there was one poster in particular who came to the site, registered a bunch of offensive, racist usernames and proceeded to post and create threads that were just full of dumb slurs. this was definitely a learning experience because i had to act quickly, so i tried a bunch of different methods to get rid of him.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>i banned his account</p>
<ul>
<li>this only worked momentarily. his account was banned, but nothing stopped him from from registering a completely new account and continuing to post racist shit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>i blocked his IP address</p>
<ul>
<li>this worked for a little bit longer, but he proceeded to get on a VPN, and then another when i blocked that IP, then another when i blocked that IP, etc, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>i added a site setting to turn off registrations entirely</p>
<ul>
<li>this was a good band-aid solution, but it wasn&#39;t great. i wanted to capitalize on the traffic that was still coming in, so i later allowed people to register, but flagged their account as &#34;unapproved.&#34; then by hand, i went and manually approved each account i thought was legit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>i created a denylist for usernames</p>
<ul>
<li>this feature came much later, but one of the last things i did to mitigate any more abuse was to create a denylist of words so that people couldn&#39;t register racist or offensive usernames</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="2-you-need-a-performance-monitoring-system">2. you need a performance monitoring system</h2>
<p>this also may seem like a no-brainer, but when hacker news ran the traffic up on basement community, the site did not handle the load well and i had almost zero insight into what was going wrong. are the SQL queries too expensive? was the main document taking too long to load? is there too much JavaScript running? i have no idea. that&#39;s why very shortly after seeing the traffic, i implemented <a href="https://sentry.io" target="_blank">Sentry</a> into both my front-end and back-end code so i can get a full picture on where the problems lie, which leads to my next point</p>
<h2 id="3-your-sql-queries-need-to-be-optimized">3. your SQL queries need to be optimized</h2>
<p>after getting some logs to work with, i noticed almost instantly that a lot of performance issues were stemming from the fact that i had way too many SQL queries running to display a simple page. this is mostly because i relied on a <a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/what-is-an-orm-and-why-you-should-use-it-b2b6f75f5e2a" target="_blank">SQL ORM</a> which in short is a tool that makes writing SQL easier to pick up and faster to develop. the biggest downside is that it might execute 50 queries to your database to get a list of information, when it probably only needs 1, which will cause slowdown.</p>
<p>this was clearly a problem and i have been tackling it in piecemeal - optimizing each page at a time. since the initial rush of traffic, i&#39;m pleased to say that the load times for the site have gotten much better.</p>
<h2 id="4-your-users-might-have-genius-ideas">4. your users might have genius ideas</h2>
<p>finally, the last note i&#39;ll make here is about listening to feedback. since launching the site, some users have suggested pretty smart features that i&#39;ve since implemented, like this back-to-top button to quickly get back to the top of the page:</p>
<p><img alt="back to top button" src="https://files.catbox.moe/pgqyrn.gif"/></p>
<p>or even non-technical features, such as creating a forum for reading, which i&#39;ve <a href="https://basementcommunity.com/forums/13" target="_blank">also added</a>.</p>
<p>point is, listen to your users. they might have better ideas than you!</p>
