                        </span> in an effort to improve working conditions and demand accountability from top executives.</p><p>Workers and activists in more than 20 countries are expected to protest as part of a campaign led by <a href="https://makeamazonpay.com/" data-analytics-module="body_link">&#34;Make Amazon Pay,&#34;</a> a coalition of 70 trade unions and organizations including Greenpeace, Oxfam, and Amazon Workers International.</p><p>Individuals everywhere &#34;from oil refineries, to factories, to warehouses, to data centers, to corporate offices&#34; are expected to participate in the November 26 event, according to the campaign.  </p><p>&#34;The pandemic has exposed how Amazon places profits ahead of workers, society, and our planet,&#34; Make Amazon Pay wrote in a list of demands <a href="https://makeamazonpay.com/" data-analytics-module="body_link">shared on its website</a>. &#34;Amazon takes too much and gives back too little. It is time to Make Amazon Pay.&#34; </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>The protests come amid growing dissent from Amazon employees over working conditions, including long hours, low pay, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-annual-performance-review-process-bonus-salary-2021-4" data-analytics-module="body_link">complex performance review systems</a>. Make Amazon Pay&#39;s demands include increased salaries, better job security, and &#34;suspending the harsh productivity and surveillance regime Amazon has used to squeeze workers.&#34;</p><p>The coalition also calls for a &#34;pay back to society&#34; that includes enhanced sustainability efforts, increased transparency over data and privacy, and ending partnerships with police forces and immigration authorities that are &#34;institutionally racist.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Amazon is not alone in these bad practices but it sits at the heart of a failed system that drives the inequality, climate breakdown, and democratic decay that scar our age,&#34; Make Amazon Pay wrote in its demands. </p><p>In a statement, Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel told Insider that the company is &#34;inventing and investing significantly&#34; in several of the categories the campaign addresses, including climate efforts, like a commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 and pushes to improve competitive wages and benefits. </p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>&#34;These groups represent a variety of interests, and while we are not perfect in any area, if you objectively look at what Amazon is doing in each one of these areas you&#39;ll see that we do take our role and our impact very seriously,&#34; Nantel said. </p><p>The rise of Make Amazon Pay also follows a fraught push for unionization across the company, including most recently at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island which <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/25/1048956134/amazon-warehouse-workers-in-new-york-to-file-for-union-vote" data-analytics-module="body_link">filed for a union vote last month</a>. The e-commerce giant became embroiled in controversy earlier this year after <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-takes-another-swipe-union-alabama-rematch-looms-2021-11-04/" data-analytics-module="body_link">reports surfaced</a> that it allegedly participated in union-busting tactics that may have thwarted a vote at a warehouse in Alabama.</p><p>As part of the Make Amazon Pay effort, the campaign also accused Amazon of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-billionaires-avoid-paying-federal-income-tax-2021-6#:~:text=Amazon%20CEO%20Jeff%20Bezos%20didn,taxes%20through%20legal%20financial%20manipulation." data-analytics-module="body_link">dodging taxes</a>. According to a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax" data-analytics-module="body_link">ProPublica report published in June</a>, its founder Jeff Bezos didn&#39;t pay any income taxes between 2006 and 2018. He is currently the richest person in the world with a net worth of $210.7 billion.</p><p>&#34;During the COVID-19 pandemic, Amazon became a trillion dollar corporation, with Bezos becoming the first person in history to amass $200 billion in personal wealth,&#34; Make Amazon Pay wrote on its website. &#34;Meanwhile, Amazon warehouse workers risked their lives as essential workers, and only briefly received an increase in pay.&#34;</p>
                        
                        
                        
                        <p>Make Amazon Pay was first formed in 2020 and has since helped drive a series of strikes and protests against company policies, particularly as unrest mounted during the pandemic. </p><p>&#34;Amazon&#39;s wealth has increased so much during the pandemic that its owners could pay all 1.3 million of its employees a $690,000 COVID bonus and still be as rich as they were in 2020,&#34; a video states on the Make Amazon Pay website. </p>
