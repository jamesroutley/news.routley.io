                        <p>Modeling and analysis from NREL transportation researchers showed that a small commercial
                           fishing vessel named <em>I Gotta </em>could be retrofitted with a hybrid battery-diesel system. The boat will make history
                           as one of the first low-emissions fishing vessels ever deployed in Alaska. <em>Photo by Eric Jordan</em></p>

               </div>
               
               <p>On a brisk morning next spring, a 46-foot commercial fishing boat will cruise into
                  the cold waters of Sitka, Alaska, and cut the diesel engine. In that moment of near
                  silence, an electric motor will whir to life. This moment will mark a sea change for
                  Sitka&#39;s small-boat commercial fishing industry: a transition to energy-efficient commercial
                  fishing, powered by low- and zero-emissions propulsion systems.
               </p>
               
               <p>The boat in question, a small commercial salmon troller named <em>I Gotta</em>, will make history as one of the first low-emissions fishing vessels ever deployed
                  in Alaska. Using a unique parallel hybrid battery-diesel system, the boat can travel
                  at full speed using its diesel engine, then switch to a battery-electric motor when
                  fishing. In this way, <em>I Gotta</em>’s captain, Eric Jordan, will be able to cut the boat’s fuel use by 80%.
               </p>
               
               <p>Hybridizing the vessel has taken a village—and several years of collaboration. The
                  project began when the Sitka-based <a href="https://www.alfafish.org/">Alaska Longline Fishermen’s Association</a> (ALFA) applied for support from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/about-energy-transitions-initiative-partnership-project">Energy Transitions Initiative Partnership Project</a> (ETIPP) to assess fishing vessel hybridization options. ETIPP paired the association
                  with commercial vehicle researchers from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory
                  (NREL) and Sandia National Laboratories. And <em>I Gotta’</em>s retrofitting has been funded with grant support from AgWest Farm Credit and Acme
                  Seafoods and coordination and data support from Kempy Energetics.
               </p>
               
               <p>But the partnership has goals far greater than hybridizing a single fishing boat.
                  ALFA aims to inspire decarbonization efforts across its entire fleet—and beyond.
               </p>
               
               <h2>Making Headway To Lower-Emissions Operations</h2>
               
               <p>The shift to lower-emissions fishing has been slow to start—but not for lack of interest,
                  said Linda Behnken, ALFA’s executive director.
               </p>
               
               <p>“We tend to be leaders in the climate and environmental space up here,” said Benkhen,
                  who leads ALFA’s Sitka-based cooperative of more than 160 small-boat commercial fishers,
                  each committed to sustaining salmon fishing for future generations. “Our fishermen
                  are really eager to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and their fuel costs.”
               </p>

                  </div> 
                  
               </div>
               
               <p>But, Behnken said, small fishers cannot risk being early adopters of a new technology
                  if it might jeopardize their fishing season, even when high fuel costs eat up as much
                  as 30% of their revenue.
               </p>
               
               <p>To take some of the risk out of the equation, Behnken applied to join ETIPP, a network
                  of regional organizations and DOE national laboratories that helps remote and island
                  communities shift their energy systems toward renewable options.
               </p>
               
               <p>Typically, ETIPP supports land-based communities. “But I thought, ‘Well, we’re a community
                  of fishing boats. Let’s see if they would support us advancing energy efficiency in
                  our fleet,’” Behnken said.
               </p>
               
               <p>ALFA was accepted to the program in 2021, and ETIPP matched the fishing cooperative
                  with NREL and Sandia transportation energy researchers who specialize in technical
                  assistance for commercial vehicle decarbonization.
               </p>
               
               <p>They faced a question: Which technologies would help a small fishing boat cut its
                  fuel dependency without sacrificing speed or range?
               </p>
               
               <p>Using years of operational data from ALFA’s fleet, the NREL and Sandia research team
                  considered potential solutions.
               </p>
               
               <p>“Our teammates from Sandia looked at running the boat off of next-generation fuels
                  like hydrogen, ammonia, and biofuels. We also considered fully battery-electric scenarios
                  and the charging and filling infrastructure that would be needed,” said NREL’s Michael
                  Lammert, a commercial vehicle electrification researcher and the project’s principal
                  investigator. “Once we looked at the data, built the models, and ran the analysis,
                  it became clear that a plug-in hybrid model was the right path forward for this boat.”
               </p>
               
               <p>Together, NREL researchers and ALFA project partners selected the Transfluid hybrid
                  propulsion system that will allow <em>I Gotta</em> to switch between a diesel engine for top speeds and a battery-electric motor to
                  cruise through favored fishing spots. The electricity to run the boat will come from
                  Sitka’s hydroelectric dams, meaning that it will come from 100% renewable sources
                  and therefore significantly reduce the boat’s greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover,
                  <em>I Gotta</em>’s hybrid system will be “smart”—capable of optimizing the use of both the engine
                  and motor—and the boat will be equipped with data loggers to measure the actual achieved
                  fuel efficiency.
               </p>
               
               <p>Each of these investments will help ALFA’s fishers chart a path forward to lower-emissions
                  operations.
               </p>
               
               <h2>Low- and Zero-Emissions Operations To Ripple Across Alaska</h2>
               
               <p>Later this year, ALFA will contract with local boat builders to begin retrofitting <em>I Gotta</em> with its hybrid system. But the work will not stop there. Renewed funding from DOE’s
                  Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy will allow ALFA to begin testing
                  not one but three novel propulsion systems that consider different ways fishing boats
                  travel.

               <p>The first, a series hybrid system, will allow fishing boats the flexibility to travel
                  either short or long distances while minimizing diesel fuel use. The series system
                  uses an electric motor to power the propeller at all boat speeds and a battery to
                  power the motor, allowing boats to travel their typical 10- to 20-mile routes under
                  battery-electric power. These batteries can be charged at a dock using Sitka’s 100%
                  renewable hydroelectric dams. In the rare case that a captain needs to travel hundreds
                  of miles for an extended trip, they can recharge the boat’s batteries with an onboard
                  diesel generator.
               </p>
               
               <p>ALFA will also test a fully battery-electric system for mariculture vessels, which
                  cultivate fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants. These vessels stay within 10 miles
                  of shore and follow regular transit schedules, making them candidates for full electrification.
                  Most importantly, by transitioning these vessels to zero-emissions operations, ALFA
                  will eliminate the risk of fuel spills close to shore or near vulnerable aquatic species.
               </p>
               
               <p>Finally, ALFA will assess an additional parallel hybrid system, like the one chosen
                  for <em>I Gotta</em>, to demonstrate its effectiveness in different operating conditions.
               </p>
               
               <p>Most importantly, local boatbuilders will handle the installations for each vessel,
                  helping Sitkans learn how to install and service low- and zero-emissions systems.
                  ALFA is planning significant outreach, training, and education opportunities to familiarize
                  the Sitka community with opportunities to get involved in the effort and to make the
                  fishing fleet aware of the project.
               </p>
               
               <p>This is all part of Behnken’s vision: to build local expertise in low-emissions propulsion
                  systems, de-risk emerging technologies, and remove the barriers to deep decarbonization
                  of the marine space.
               </p>
               
               <p>“Everybody who fishes up here cares about the ocean. We care about our legacy to the
                  next generation of fishermen and people who live in these coastal communities,” Behnken
                  said. “This isn’t just a way to earn a living—it’s a way of life. And this is a way
                  to honor our deep commitment to the ocean, all while we become better at what we do.”
               </p>
               
               <p>The community of Sitka, Behnken said, is the right place to begin this work. But she
                  also plans for the work to ripple outward into the maritime community as a whole.
               </p>
               
               <p>“Our goal is to inspire decarbonization across more fleets,” she said. “We hope to
                  set an example by walking the walk and showing how it can be done. We’re building
                  local capacity here in Sitka knowing that the lessons we learn here can be applied
                  elsewhere. And we really hope they will.”
