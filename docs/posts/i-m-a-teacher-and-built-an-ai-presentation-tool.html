    <h1>Show HN: I&#39;m a teacher and built an AI presentation tool</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi,
I&#39;m a high school teacher from Australia and I&#39;ve built what I&#39;d like to think is a pretty nifty ChatGPT powered presentation tool for teachers.</p><p>I&#39;d love it if you could have a look at it and give me some of your feedback.</p><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much overlap with the HN crowd and school teachers, but I&#39;ve been coming here for many years and thought I&#39;d post here and see what you all think.</p><p>Check it out if you have a minute and I&#39;d be super happy to hear your feedback too.</p><p><a href="https://www.slidehero.ai/" rel="nofollow">https://www.slidehero.ai/</a></p><p>You can jump in and have a play with the tool all you like ;)</p><p>Cheers, Eli</p></div></div></div>
