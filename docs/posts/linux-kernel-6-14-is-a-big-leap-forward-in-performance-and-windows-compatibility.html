Linux Torvalds confessed that he&#39;d love to have had &#34;<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wg7TO09Si5tTPyhdrLLvyYtVmCf+GGN4kVJ0=Xk=5TE3g@mail.gmail.com/T/#u" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some good excuse for why I didn&#39;t do the 6.14 release yesterday</a> on my regular Sunday afternoon release schedule. …  But no. It&#39;s just pure incompetence. Because absolutely nothing last-minute happened yesterday, and I was just clearing up some unrelated things in order to be ready for the merge window. And in the process just entirely forgot to actually ever cut the release. D&#39;oh.&#34;</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-compile-your-first-linux-kernel-and-3-reasons-why-you-should/">How to compile your first Linux kernel (and 3 reasons why you should)</a></strong></p><p>Despite the minor delay, Linux 6.14 arrives packed with cutting-edge features and improvements to power upcoming Linux distributions, such as the forthcoming <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/ubuntu-25-04-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubuntu 25.04</a> and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/download/?beta" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fedora 42</a>.</p><p>The big news for desktop users is the improved <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-NTSYNC-Driver-Ready" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NTSYNC</a> driver, especially those who like to <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-easily-run-windows-apps-on-linux-with-wine/">play Windows games or run Windows programs on Linux</a>. This driver is designed to emulate Windows NT synchronization primitives. What that feature means for you and me is that it will significantly improve the performance of Windows programs running on <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/with-wine-10-update-run-your-windows-app-on-linux-better-than-ever/">Wine</a> and <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/08F7-5D56-9654-39AF" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Play</a>. </p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/eu-os-takes-a-layered-approach-to-its-new-linux-distro-for-the-public-sector/">EU OS takes a &#39;layered&#39; approach to its new Linux distro for the public sector</a></strong></p><p>Linux gamers are eagerly awaiting this release. YouTube Linux video host Gardiner Bryant proclaimed, &#34;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOjXYsWZuN8" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NTSYNC will change Linux gaming forever.</a>&#34; On Reddit, one poster said, &#34;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1hzmd1u/comment/m6rndsi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NTsync hits all points</a>. It&#39;s fast, portable, robust, and correct. The correctness comes from just straight up implementing Windows style synchronization semantics in a kernel module rather than trying to jury-rig or iterate on the futex/futex2 interface.&#34;</p><p>Gamers always want the best possible graphics performance, so they&#39;ll also be happy to see that Linux now supports recently launched <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-2-28-amd-unveils-next-generation-amd-rdna-4-architectu.html?ref=news.itsfoss.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AMD RDNA 4</a> graphics cards. This approach includes support for the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. Combine this support with the <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpu-drivers/valve-engineers-amd-linux-radv-vulkan-driver-fix-boosted-an-fsr2-demo-sample-app-by-228-percent-on-rdna-2-gpus" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently improved open-source RADV driver</a> and AMD gamers should see the best speed yet on their gaming rigs.</p><!----><p>Of course, the release is not just for gamers. Linux 6.14 also includes several AMD and Intel processor enhancements. These boosts focus on power management, thermal control, and compute performance optimizations. These updates are expected to improve overall system efficiency and performance.</p><p>This release also comes with the <a href="https://github.com/amd/xdna-driver" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AMDXDNA driver</a>, which provides official support for AMD&#39;s neural processing units based on the XDNA architecture. This integration enables efficient execution of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/">AI workloads</a>, such as convolutional neural networks and large language models, directly on supported AMD hardware.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/finally-a-linux-laptop-with-a-brilliant-display-and-performance-that-rivals-my-macbook/">Finally, a Linux laptop with a brilliant display and performance that rivals my MacBook</a></strong></p><p>While <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/rust-in-linux-now-progress-pitfalls-and-why-devs-and-maintainers-need-each-other/">Rust has faced some difficulties in recent months in Linux</a>, more Rust programming language abstractions have been integrated into the kernel, laying the groundwork for future drivers written in Rust. As Greg Kroah-Hartman, the stable Linux kernel maintainer, recently pointed out, with &#34;rust misc driver bindings and other rust changes to make misc drivers actually possible. I think <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.13-char-misc-More-Rust" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this is the tipping point</a>, expect to see way more rust drivers going forward now that these bindings are present.&#34; </p><p>Besides drivers, Miguel Ojeda, <a href="https://rust-for-linux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rust for Linux</a>&#39;s lead developer, said recently that the introduction of the macro for smart pointers with Rust 1.84: derive(CoercePointee) is an &#34;<a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Smart-pointer-and-more-Rust-code-for-the-Linux-kernel-6-14-10250840.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">important milestone on the way to building a kernel that only uses stable Rust</a> functions.&#34; This approach will also make integrating C and Rust code easier. We&#39;re getting much closer to Rust being grafted into Linux&#39;s tree. </p><p>In addition, Linux 6.14 supports Qualcomm&#39;s latest <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8-elite-mobile-platform" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile processor</a>, enhancing performance and stability for devices powered by this chipset. That support means you can expect to see <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/qualcomms-snapdragon-8-elite-chip-will-make-your-phone-less-annoying/">much faster Android-based smartphones</a> later this year.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-4-most-windows-like-linux-distros-to-try-because-change-is-hard/">The 4 most Windows-like Linux distros to try because change is hard</a></strong></p><p>This release includes a patch for the so-called <a href="https://ghostwriteattack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GhostWrite vulnerability</a>, which can be used to root some <a href="https://riscv.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RISC-V processors</a>. This fix will block such attacks.</p><p>Additionally, Linux 6.14 includes improvements for the copy-on-write <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/btrfs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Btrfs file system/logical volume manager</a>. These primarily read-balancing methods offer flexibility for different RAID hardware configurations and workloads. Additionally, support for uncached buffered I/O optimizes memory usage on systems with fast storage devices.</p><p>In short, the Linux kernel 6.14 represents a major step forward in Linux&#39;s evolution, offering a robust set of features that cater to diverse user needs, from gaming enthusiasts to AI researchers and developers. Despite the minor delay in its release, the kernel&#39;s enhancements solidify Linux&#39;s position as a versatile and forward-thinking platform. </p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/whats-the-best-tiling-window-manager-for-a-linux-beginner/">What&#39;s the best tiling window manager for a Linux beginner?</a></strong></p><p>If you want to start tinkering with the kernel today, you can: <a href="https://web.git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tag/?h=v6.14" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Linux 6.14 is now available for download</a>. Looking ahead, Torvalds expects more changes for 6.15 because of a &#34;pending pile of pull requests.&#34;</p></div></div></div>
