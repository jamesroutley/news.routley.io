    <h1>What would a decentralised Uber look like?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemprop="blogPost"><div itemprop="https://schema.org/articleBody">
<p>Uber are undoubtedly a company engaged in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/jul/10/uber-files-leak-reveals-global-lobbying-campaign">extremely dodgy activity</a>. But, on the other had, they&#39;re ridiculously convenient.</p><p>A few months ago, we landed in a foreign country, opened the same Uber app as we used back home, and booked a cab. It just worked. I didn&#39;t need to register for a different version. I didn&#39;t need to create a new account. I didn&#39;t need to add a new credit card.  That&#39;s the sort of seamless experience which can <em>only</em> come from a centralised service.</p><p>But, hey, we&#39;re all moving to a ReDeCentralised Federated Future.  <a href="https://discworld.fandom.com/wiki/Nac_Mac_Feegle"><i lang="sco">Nae king! Nae quin! Nae laird! Nae master! We willna&#39; be fooled again!</i></a> So let&#39;s think about how a decentralised Uber would work.</p><h2 id="broadcast"><a href="#broadcast">Broadcast</a></h2><p>In the days before mobile phones, we could have used something like CB radio.  Broadcast a message to everyone in a few miles saying you want to travel from point A to point B.</p><p>Cabbies, or their agents, could reply to you with their availability and prices.</p><p>But that puts a lot of work on you to manage all the replies. And you have no idea of the driver rating. And you&#39;ll be broadcasting your location to all and sundry.</p><p>And, sadly, modern handsets have no concept of a broadcasting in a P2P manner.</p><h2 id="perhaps-a-little-centralisation"><a href="#perhaps-a-little-centralisation">Perhaps a <em>little</em> centralisation?</a></h2><p>In most parts of the world, taxis are regulated. You don&#39;t want rapists, thieves, and murderers driving you home late at night.  You want a predictable fare calculated by an honest meter.</p><p>So let&#39;s say you have an app which knows your location, and send your request to the taxi-regulation-boards which cover your area. They can then broadcast out the request to all drivers, they confirm the fare, and then send it back to you.</p><p>I guess that <em>could</em> work. Think of all the taxi-regulators as little ActivityPub servers, and the cab drivers getting a stream of requests on their federated timeline.  Your phone could receive &#34;accepts&#34; from multiple drivers and you could pick the one you like.</p><p>But how would your phone know <em>which</em> local taxi services are available?  You would need a <em>centralised</em> list of them!</p><h2 id="foaf-and-signed-claims"><a href="#foaf-and-signed-claims">FOAF and Signed Claims</a></h2><p>One of the supposed advantages of Uber is that it allows participants to rate each other. Passengers don&#39;t want to get in a car with an arsehole. Drivers don&#39;t want to pick up people who litter.</p><p>How would that work without a central entity? Could there be a solution with Verified Credentials? Have all participants write cryptographically signed ratings to a <em>*spits*</em> Blockchain?</p><p><a href="https://ariadne.space/2022/12/03/building-fair-webs-of-trust-by-leveraging-the-ocap-model/">Reputation Systems are hard</a>.</p><h2 id="user-needs"><a href="#user-needs">User Needs</a></h2><p>Of course, before sketching out such a system, it probably helps to sketch out some vague thoughts on what users actually want from a taxi system - and how decentralisation would <em>help</em>.</p><p>Firstly, who are the users?</p><p>As a driver, I don&#39;t want to have multiple phones and apps stuck to my dashboard.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/1po4wi/taxi_in_hong_kong/"><img decoding="async" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/phones.jpeg" alt="Photo of the inside of a Hong Kong taxi. There are about a dozen different phones attached to the dashboard - each running a different app." width="537" height="720"/></a></p><p>As a user, I only want to use a reputable driver. But who determines reputation? What options do I have if something goes wrong?</p><p>Basically - what are the <em>advantages</em> of decentralisation in the taxi space?  Users want competition on price and service - which they don&#39;t get if Uber are a monopoly.  Users also don&#39;t want to deal with dangerous drivers - which is easier to enforce if there is only a single platform.</p><p>Drivers don&#39;t want their livelihood ruined by unjust reviews - how could that be enforced with a decentralised platform?</p><p>We haven&#39;t even got to payments yet!</p><p>Basically, it&#39;s not clear to me that is a compelling user <em>need</em> for decentralisation. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like it as a concept. But I see it as exchanging one set of wicked problems for another.</p><h2 id="does-this-already-exist"><a href="#does-this-already-exist">Does this already exist?</a></h2><p>Well, ish.  There are various different attempts to build federated delivery services and the like.</p><p>But I am very interested in being proved wrong! Is there a decentralised takeaway service I should investigate? Are there federated hairdressers? Does anyone offer an open protocol for domestic cleaners?</p></div></article></div>
