    <h1>Feedback: the feed seems just fine...</h1>
    
    
<p>
Earlier, someone wrote in saying &#34;the RSS feed seems to be broken&#34;, but 
didn&#39;t leave any contact info.  All I have is an IP address and whatever 
the web server logged.  Let&#39;s just see what we got here, and see what&#39;s 
broken and what isn&#39;t.
</p>
<p>
xx:01:29 : requests feed over http with no conditional headers 
(If-Modified-Since, If-None-Match).  Receives entire feed as a result.  
Expected behavior for first fetch.
</p>
<p>
xx:03:53 : requests feed over http again... with no conditional   
headers.  It&#39;s been a hair over two minutes.  The server rejects it 
with a 
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6585#section-4">429</a>
&#34;Too Many Requests&#34;.  Strong signal for a broken feed reader.
</p>
<p>
xx:20:37 : third request over http with no conditional headers (so it 
wants the unchanged feed again, 19 minutes later).  Rejected the same 
way.
</p>
<p>
Then things pivot and hit the &#34;secure&#34; side of the site.  I treat them 
differently for the purposes of throttling, or very bad things would 
happen to feed aggregator places which subscribe to both versions of the 
feed.
</p>
<p>
xx:21:46 : requests feed over https.  Sends no conditional headers.  
Receives entire feed since it&#39;s specifically rigged to not care about 
the earlier http traffic.
</p>
<p>
xx:22:04 : requests feed over https again.  Sends no conditional headers 
despite receiving entire feed 18 seconds earlier.  Is rejected with a 
429.
</p>
<p>
xx:22:11 : requests feed over https a third time, again with no 
conditional headers.  Is rejected with a 429 again.
</p>
<p>
xx:22:18 : fourth request over https, again no conditional headers, is 
again thrown in the bit bucket with a 429.
</p>
<p>
xx:23:13 : fifth request over https, still no conditional headers.
Gets 429.
</p>
<p>
I&#39;d say things are working perfectly... here.  There&#39;s a feed reader 
involved which doesn&#39;t send conditional requests, doesn&#39;t throttle on a 
429, and doesn&#39;t surface HTTP failure codes to the user, but I have no 
control over that.
