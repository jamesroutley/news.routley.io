    <h1>MFB-522 Sample Pack</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p>Over the last month, I borrowed the excellent <a href="https://www.analoguehaven.com/mfb/mfb522/">MFB-522 Drumcomputer</a> from the <a href="https://synthlibrarynyc.org/">Synth Library</a>. The MFB-522 is an all-analogue drum machine that sounds quite similar to the Roland TR-808 except I’ve always thought the hi-hats sounded better.</p>

<p>The unit used to be mine, but I decided more people would get use out of it if I gave it to the Synth Library. But I always regretted not recording its sounds before I did. So when I saw it was available last month, I took to opportunity to check it out :).</p>

<p>You can download the resulting sample pack from my new <a href="https://brian.abelson.live/samples">samples page</a>. I plan on sporadically adding more in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Synth Library, I’ll be hosting another <a href="https://lu.ma/rqxfg8x3">Floating Synth Room</a> later this month featuring the Sequential Circuits Pro-One. Hope to see you there!</p>
