    <h1>MFB-522 Sample Pack</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p>Over the last month, I borrowed the excellent <a href="https://www.analoguehaven.com/mfb/mfb522/">MFB-522 Drumcomputer</a> from the <a href="https://synthlibrarynyc.org/">Synth Library</a>. The MFB-522 is an all-analogue drum machine that’s quite similar to the Roland TR-808 except I’ve always thought the hi-hats sounded better.</p>

<p>I previously owned this unit, but felt more people would get use out of it if I gave it to the Synth Library. However, I always regretted not recording its sounds before I did. So when I saw it was available last month, I took to the opportunity to check it out :).</p>

<p>I ran the samples through a <a href="https://www.soundcraft.com/en-US/products/FX16ii">SoundCraft mixer</a> with a bus that included a <a href="https://warmaudio.com/mic-pre-wa73-eq">Warm Audio WA273-EQ Pre-amp</a> (basically a Neve 1073 clone) and a <a href="https://fmraudio.com/rnc.html">FMR Audio RNC1773 compressor</a>, which served mostly as a limiter. The samples were recorded in stereo but also exported in mono.</p>

<p>You can download the resulting sample pack from my new <a href="https://brian.abelson.live/samples">samples page</a>. I plan on sporadically adding more in the future.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Synth Library, I’ll be hosting another <a href="https://lu.ma/rqxfg8x3">Floating Synth Room</a> later this month featuring the Sequential Circuits Pro-One. Hope to see you there!</p>
