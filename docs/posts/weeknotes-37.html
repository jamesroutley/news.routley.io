<li>hi, hello there, hi! a new week approaches, so here is a new weeknote.</li>
<li>been listening to so much hozier (as per, honestly), especially enjoying <em>through me (the flood)</em>. lucy dacus has a new album out which i should try properly at some point, and not just listen to <em>ankles</em> over and over.</li>
<li>daily writing hasn&#39;t been going amazing; i&#39;ve only written something 3 days this week. i&#39;m going to try and systemise a little. my new pact is to do <strong>at least one 25-minute session of writing a day, with notifications off. i&#39;m allowed to search for stuff if it&#39;s directly relevant but otherwise no bouncing off to other stuff online</strong>. today is the first day and my brain feels a bit crumbly at best but i think it&#39;s better to have a time slot based, rather than output/word count based goal for me. this is especially because i&#39;m trying to make it a practice, and am not writing &#34;for&#34; something, but if any of you regularly writing but not for a &#34;goal&#34; people have word count goals <a href="https://olu.online/contact">get in touch</a>, i&#39;d love to hear how you decided!</li>
<li>realising how few photographs i take is upsetting me a few times every week at the moment. am i taking more photos? well, that would be the sensible thing to do in the face of this feeling, so of course not! i think i&#39;m too much of a homebody, despite that not making sense. there are many cool things in the house, that&#39;s why i like it there/here!</li>
<li>do any of you know any cool card (playing! tarot! like digital versions of cardboard and paper cards!) interaction things online? i want to make some tarot card experiments, inspired by <a href="https://moonlight.world">moonlight</a> which &#34;feel&#34; more like real cards. I feel like games will probably have a lot of this (i am interested in this!) and would especially like to see any examples on the web! <a href="https://olu.online/contact">hit me up!</a></li>
<li>it&#39;s been very sunny! i enjoy cold with sun a lot more than hot with sun, so really bracing for summer, but so far i&#39;m having a good time. no sun-caused headaches yet either.</li>
<li>hoping i manage to make it to the gym next week! i signed up for a kickstart that is 6 weeks, but so far I&#39;ve only made the induction. hopefully i get down at least once a week!</li>
<li>i did, started or scheduled all my tasks i noted down for this week! which doesn&#39;t sound impressive but is to me, my list is usually pretty aspirational accidentally. long may it continue.</li>
<li>struggling a little with what to do for my next <a href="https://olu.online/blog/?q=alphabet-superset">alphabet superset</a> post; i&#39;m working on post m. i&#39;m tempted to write about <a href="https://olu.online/ai">ai/llm</a> stuff and leave not touch it again in the series lol. i feel like everything else isn&#39;t grabbing me, but i&#39;m annoyed by how much brain space, air, water and human and non-human resources its using, both in the media and physically.</li>
<li>thanks for reading, have a great week. ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
