      <b>LL3M uses a team of large language models to write Python code that creates and edits 3D assets in Blender.</b>
      Given user text instructions, the agents are capable of creating expressive shapes from scratch, and realizing
      complex, precise geometric manipulations in code.

      Whereas previous uses of code-writing LLMs for 3D creation have focused on specific subtasks or constrained
      procedural programs and primitives, our method is able to create unconstrained assets with geometry, layout, and
      appearance.

      With high-level code as a 3D representation, our pipeline is natively a loop of iterative refinement and
      co-creation: agents perform automatic code and visual self-critique, and users can provide continuous high-level
      feedback. Further editing avenues are enabled by the clear code and the parameters transparent in the generated
      Blender nodes and structures.

    <h2>Pipeline overview</h2>
    <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig1-workflow.webp" alt="process diagram"/>
    <p>
      <b>Our method includes three phases</b>: initial creation, automatic refinement, and user-guided refinement.
      These are conceptual phases in the creation process; each phase involves different agent roles of its own.
      The first
      phase creates an initial shape, where implausible configurations, like a disconnected backrest, as well as
      simplistic geometry are
      <em>automatically</em> corrected and improved upon by the second phase. Afterwards, our system can accept
      additional edit
      instructions from the user, allowing for <em>interactive</em> and <em>iterative</em> 3D asset generation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Generating and refining iteratively</b> is thus the native mode of operation for LL3M.
      More than just error correction, the pipeline realizes an iterative, coarse-to-fine creation process,
      involving both automatic and user-guided refinement.

    <h2>Gallery</h2>

    <p>
      <b>LL3M is capable of diverse shape generation</b>. The results showcase detailed parts (e.g.
      the windmill architectural features) in intricate arrangements (e.g. the piano keys, the drum kit), and even a
      rich appearance (the skateboard) and material properties (the glossy lamp base). A notable feature of our approach
      is that each mesh is generated through interpretable, editable Blender code.

    <h2>Consistent stylization</h2>
    <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig7-diff-in-same-out.jpg" alt=""/>
    <p>
      Starting from different initial meshes produced by LL3M and the same
      refinement prompt <em>change the style to steampunk</em> LL3M successfully interprets and applies the same
      style concept to each hat. Each stylized mesh produces distinct variations, including both geometric modifications
      and appearance changes.

    <h2>Material editing</h2>
    <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig5-same-in-diff-mat.jpg"/>
    <p>
      Given an initial mesh produced by our system, our system is capable of editing the materials on a specific part of
      the mesh (the blade of the knife), by creating comprehensive procedural materials via shader nodes.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Iterative creation</h2>
    <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig22-humanoid.webp" alt=""/>
    <p>
      LL3M enables multiple successive edits of the same 3D asset. The
      modifications are faithful to the user&#39;s instructions, editing only the specified element while preserving the
      character&#39;s identity.
    </p>

    <h2>Interpretable code</h2>
    <div>
      <p><img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig21-snippet.webp" alt=""/></p><p>
        Our method generates Blender code that is easy to understand and follow. The code
        is well-documented with descriptive comments, clear variable names, and structured logic. This interpretable
        code makes it easy to potentially change variables (e.g. the key width) or even algorithmic logic (e.g. the
        keyboard pattern).
      </p>

    <h2>Transparent parameters</h2>
    <div>
      <p><img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig6-interpretable-slider.webp" alt=""/></p><p>
        By generating shapes through Blender code, LL3M allows intuitive user edits by virtue of the interpretable
        parameters transparent in the code and in the generated Blender nodes and structures.
        For example, when generating a material, our system creates a full set of shader nodes. Users can then
        easily adjust visual attributes, such as tuning the color or stripe pattern directly in Blender to achieve the
        desired output.
      </p>

    <h2>Generality &amp; reuse of code</h2>
    <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig15-intro-highlight.jpg"/>
    <p>
      Despite visual differences, shapes often share high-level code patterns (such as loops, modifiers, and node
      setups) that recur across categories. This shared structure allows the model to transfer knowledge and generate
      diverse, editable, and modular code from a wide range of prompts.
    </p>

    <h2>Scenes &amp; hierarchies</h2>
    <p><img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig13-scene.jpg"/>
      <img src="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~namanh/remoteassets/ll3m/fig19-parenting.jpg"/>
    </p>
    <p>
      LL3M is capable of generating multiple objects and arranging them with appropriate spatial relationships
      within a single scene. Our system achieves this task using complex operations such as instancing and parenting
      relationships to build the scene hierarchy.
