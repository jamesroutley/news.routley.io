    <h1>Nyquest NY8A051H â€“ 1.5 cent microcontroller: weekend die-shot</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>If you was surprised to see <a href="https://zeptobars.com/en/read/wch-ch32v003-risc-v-riscv-microcontroller-10-cent">10-cent microcontroller</a> - <a href="https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/Microcontroller-Units-MCUs-MPUs-SOCs_Nyquest-Tech-NY8A051H_C5143390.html">Nyquest Technology NY8A051H</a> pushes price expectations much, much further down: It&#39;s high volume pricing is just 1.5 cents, and it is currently the cheapest microcontroller in the world* (cheaper than Padauk, holder of previous record). I had to order whopping 20pcs as minimum order, and it was still under 1$. For these 1.5 cents you don&#39;t get much: 1k word of OTP memory and 48 bytes of SRAM, but this might be just enough for many simple applications. And if you need even less and would like to save another fraction of a cent, Nyquest offers a range of simpler 4-bit MCU&#39;s.</p></div></div>
