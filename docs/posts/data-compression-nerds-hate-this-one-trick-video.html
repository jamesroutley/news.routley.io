<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>How one guy in his bedroom (kind of) beat all of PNG&#39;s combined multi-decade effort in one year, and why that&#39;s strange.</p>

<p>For over two decades, PNG has been the state-of-the-art for lossless image compression. But the Quite Okay Image Format is an emerging low-complexity alternative that offers a different perspective on data compression. This is a talk about PNG, JPEG, QOI, and how more complex doesn&#39;t always mean better. Also included: lots of juicy data compression nerdery, including many basics, and an unsurprisingly large amount of maths.</p>
