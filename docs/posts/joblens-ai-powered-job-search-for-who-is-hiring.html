    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>q&amp;a</p><div><p>How does this work?</p><p>One of the superpowers of LLMs is reformatting information from any format X to any other format Y. We leverage this to map all the unstructured job postings into the same unified structure. The new GPT functions feature and the extended context windows are really helpful for this. Instead of having to build a custom NER pipeline, it works very well with GPT out-of-the box.</p></div><div><p>Can I add more sources?</p><p>You&#39;ll be able to fully customize your job sources soon, including the ability to add your preferred companies.</p></div><div><p>What&#39;s next?</p><p>Personalize monitoring for jobs, events, and real estate. Imagine using AI to rate local events from multiple sources based on your preferences, considering factors like your interests and distance from home.</p></div></div></div></div>
