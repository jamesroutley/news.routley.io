  <section><p>As a bitcoin mining enterprise, Riot Platforms runs thousands of computers in the energy-guzzling pursuit of minting digital currency. Recently, however, the company got big bucks from Texas to lower the mining operation&#39;s electricity usage.</p><p>Riot said on Wednesday that the state&#39;s power grid operator paid the company $31.7 million in energy credits in August — or roughly $22 million more than the value of the bitcoin it mined that month — to cut its energy consumption during a record-breaking <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/tag/heatwave/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">heatwave in the state</a>. </p><p>The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the state&#39;s power grid, issues the credits to incentivize companies to reduce activities that might strain the state&#39;s already overloaded energy system.</p>    
  <p>&#34;The effects of these credits significantly lower Riot&#39;s cost to mine bitcoin and are a key element in making Riot one of the lowest cost producers of bitcoin in the industry,&#34; CEO Jason Les said in a <a href="https://www.riotplatforms.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/159/riot-announces-august-2023-production-and-operations-updates#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRiot%20achieved%20a%20new%20monthly,equated%20to%20approximately%201%2C136%20Bitcoin." target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">statement</a>.</p><p>Riot, which is publicly traded, in 2022 reported a loss of more than $500 million on revenue of $259.2 million. In its most recent quarter, it had a loss of roughly $27 million on revenue of $76.7 million.</p>

    

<p>Texas&#39; power grid has faced growing demand from consumers and businesses in recent years as climate change leads to more extreme weather. In 2021, residents faced a blackout <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-power-outage-storm-climate-change/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">when a snowstorm knocked out</a></span> coal and gas facilities, nuclear plants, and wind turbines.</p><p>The strain on the grid persists. On Wednesday, Texas officials <a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/local/ercot-moves-out-of-emergency-operations-after-energy-emergency-alert-level-2-issued-wednesday" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">declared an emergency</a> as sky-high temperatures again threatened to trigger rolling blackouts across the state. ERCOT asked that residents and business owners conserve energy between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m., according to <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/ercot-calls-on-texans-to-conserve-energy-thursday-evening/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http="">CBS News Texas</a></span>.</p><p>&#34;Operating reserves are expected to be low this afternoon due to continued high temperatures, high demand, low wind, &amp; declining solar power generation into the afternoon &amp; evening hours,&#34; the group said in a <a href="https://publish.twitter.com/?query=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FERCOT_ISO%2Fstatus%2F1699816672549326924&amp;widget=Tweet" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">post </a>on X (formerly known as Twitter).</p><p>Bitcoin mining, in which virtual transactions are verified on a computer network in exchange for a certain amount of bitcoin, is highly energy-intensive. Bitcoin consumes roughly 110 Terawatt Hours per year, or 0.55% of global electricity production — roughly equivalent to that consumed by Sweden, <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbnsi/cbeci" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">data</a> from the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance shows.</p>

    
    

<p>Riot did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  </p><h2>Public concerns</h2><p>Heavy energy consumption from bitcoin mining has caused a stir in Texas, with some people expressing anger that their tax dollars are subsidizing energy credits for miners. Residents of Navarro County, Texas, started a petition last year opposing a bitcoin mining facility in their area. </p><p>&#34;This factory-that-produces-nothing will affect every single citizen of Navarro County and MUST BE STOPPED,&#34; reads the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/no-to-riot-bitcoin-mine-in-navarro-county" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">petition</a>, which has amassed nearly 1,200 signatures. &#34;We do NOT want this enormous burden on our already fragile infrastructure.&#34;</p><p>Some Texas lawmakers have also grown wary of cryptocurrency mining. In April, the state&#39;s senate passed a <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/88R/billtext/pdf/SB01751I.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">bill</a> that would limit incentives for miners participating in the state&#39;s energy grid load-reduction program. </p><p>For now, the credits are a boon for Riot and other bitcoin miners whose profits have dried up during a cryptocurrency market downturn deepened by the collapse of exchange FTX last fall.</p>
