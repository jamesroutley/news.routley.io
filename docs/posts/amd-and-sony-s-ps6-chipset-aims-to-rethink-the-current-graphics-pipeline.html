    <h1>AMD and Sony&#39;s PS6 chipset aims to rethink the current graphics pipeline</h1>

          <p>It feels like it was just yesterday that Sony hardware architect Mark Cerny was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/sonys-ps4-successor-sports-3d-audio-tech-faster-ssd-storage/">first teasing Sony&#39;s &#34;PS4 successor&#34;</a> and its &#34;enhanced ray-tracing capabilities&#34; powered by new AMD chips. Now that we&#39;re <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/playstation-5-review-more-of-a-generational-hop-than-a-leap/">nearly five full years into the PS5 era</a>, it&#39;s time for Sony and AMD to start teasing the new chips that will power what Cerny calls &#34;a future console in a few years&#39; time.&#34;</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw">a quick nine-minute video posted Thursday</a>, Cerny sat down with Jack Huynh, the senior VP and general manager of AMD&#39;s Computing and Graphics Group, to talk about &#34;Project Amethyst,&#34; a co-engineering effort between both companies that was <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136">also teased back in July</a>. And while that Project Amethyst hardware currently only exists in the form of a simulation, Cerny said that the &#34;results are quite promising&#34; for a project that&#39;s still in the &#34;early days.&#34;</p>
<h2>Mo’ ML, fewer problems?</h2>
<p>Project Amethyst is focused on going beyond traditional rasterization techniques that don&#39;t scale well when you try to &#34;brute force that with raw power alone,&#34; Huynh said in the video. Instead, the new architecture is focused on more efficient running of the kinds of machine-learning-based neural networks behind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amds-fsr-4-upscaling-is-exclusive-to-90-series-radeon-gpus-wont-work-on-other-cards/">AMD&#39;s FSR upscaling technology</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/sony-announces-ps5-pro-a-700-graphics-workhorse-available-nov-7/">Sony&#39;s similar PSSR system</a>.</p>

<p>My good friend and fellow gamer <a href="https://twitter.com/cerny?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@cerny</a> and I recently reflected on our shared journey — symbolized by these two pieces of amethyst, split from the same stone.</p>
<p>Project Amethyst is a co-engineering effort between <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PlayStation</a> and… <a href="https://t.co/De9HWV3Ub2">pic.twitter.com/De9HWV3Ub2</a></p>
<p>— Jack Huynh (@JackMHuynh) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>While that kind of upscaling currently helps let GPUs pump out 4K graphics in real time, Cerny said that the &#34;nature of the GPU fights us here,&#34; requiring calculations to be broken up into subproblems to be handled in a somewhat inefficient parallel process by the GPU&#39;s individual compute units.</p>
<p>To get around this issue, Project Amethyst uses &#34;neural arrays&#34; that let compute units share data and process problems like a &#34;single focused AI engine,&#34; Cerny said. While the entire GPU won&#39;t be connected in this manner, connecting small sets of compute units like this allows for more scalable shader engines that can &#34;process a large chunk of the screen in one go,&#34; Cerny said. That means Project Amethyst will let &#34;more and more of what you see on screen... be touched or enhanced by ML,&#34; Huynh added.</p>
