    <h1>Designing for non-rectangular browser windows</h1>

<p>How I miss the days when phone manufacturers were innovative. Nowadays everything is just a boring black rectangle.</p><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How to end a frontend developer&#39;s career <a href="https://t.co/AYsI0pghh5">pic.twitter.com/AYsI0pghh5</a></p><p>‚Äî Tawanda Nyahuyeüë®‚Äçüíª (@towernter) <a href="https://twitter.com/towernter/status/1522461031615848450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 6, 2022</a></p></blockquote><p>I imagine that this (concept) device would probably just put the browser only on one row / column. Probably sensible, but utterly BORING!</p><p>Let&#39;s imagine a few bonkers devices.  Here&#39;s a daft concept phone with a punch-hole camera cutting out its screen.</p><p><img src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Phone-Corner-Camera.jpg" alt="Mock up of a phone with a huge camera jutting out of its corner." width="640" height="427"/></p><p>What would text scrolling look like on that? Well, it&#39;s pretty easy to mock up!</p><p>The code to do this is pretty damn simple!</p><p>First, set a function to trigger whenever the body is scrolled. Then shove a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in at the top.</p><pre><code>&lt;body onscroll=&#34;moveCircle()&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div id=&#34;tl&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
</code></pre><p>Next, draw a <code>shape-outside</code> of a circle. This will wrap the text around a quarter circle.</p><pre><code>#tl {
  shape-outside: circle(20% at 0px 0px);
  width: 10em;
  height: 100%;
  float: left;
}
</code></pre><p>Finally, the Javascript which runs whenever the page is scrolled. It moves the circle so its centre stays in the top-left of the physical screen.</p><pre><code>function moveCircle() { 
   document.getElementById(&#34;tl&#34;).style.shapeOutside = &#34;circle(20% at 0px &#34; + window.pageYOffset + &#34;px)&#34;; 
}
</code></pre><p>That&#39;s it!</p><p>What if your phone&#39;s notch was MASSIVE and you wanted to scroll text around it?</p><p>Again, this uses <code>shape-outside</code> but this time feeding it a polygon:</p><pre><code>document.getElementById(&#34;tl&#34;).style.shapeOutside =
    &#34;polygon(0 &#34; + (150 + window.pageYOffset) + &#34;px, 100px &#34; + 
            (150 + window.pageYOffset) + &#34;px, 100px &#34; + (300 + window.pageYOffset) + &#34;px)&#34;; 
</code></pre><p>CNN once posited that <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/05/opinion/curran-lampe-mobile-phones/">the smartphone of the future could be triangluar</a></p><p>What would it be like to read text on such a device?<br/></p><p>Hell. it would be hell.</p><p>OK, let&#39;s go utterly ridiculous. What if that L-shaped phone could open and close <em>while</em> you were reading and scrolling? It&#39;d look something like this:</p><p>Weird, right?</p><p>Imagine you&#39;re on DEEP SPACE NINE where all the Cardassian screens are oval shaped.</p><p>With a bit of bashing about with polygons, you can sort-of make that happen.</p><p>I&#39;m not even going to give the iCarly Pear Phone a go!</p><h2 id="omg-these-are-all-horrible"><a href="#omg-these-are-all-horrible">OMG! THESE ARE ALL HORRIBLE!</a></h2><p>Yes. We&#39;re mostly used to text filling a rectangular space. And it is rare that the material we read on changes shape.</p><p>But it doesn&#39;t have to be that way. The technology is here to make non-rectangular screens a reality. There are plenty of smart-watches with circular faces - but we can go so far beyond that.</p><p>There&#39;s an excellent paper called &#34;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2858036.2858057">Investigating Text Legibility on Non-Rectangular Displays</a>&#34; which looks at the usability of weirdly-shaped displays.  I hope it becomes required reading if / when screens start getting interesting again.</p><h2 id="bonus-video"><a href="#bonus-video">Bonus Video</a></h2><p>Here&#39;s a video talking about how GUIs will adapt to non-rectangular displays.</p></div></div>
