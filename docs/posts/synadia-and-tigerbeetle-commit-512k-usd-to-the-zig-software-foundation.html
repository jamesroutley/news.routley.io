    <h1>Synadia and TigerBeetle Commit $512k USD to the Zig Software Foundation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
<p>Synadia and TigerBeetle have together pledged a combined <strong>$512,000 USD</strong> to the <strong>Zig Software Foundation (ZSF)</strong> over the next two years, demonstrating a shared belief in Zig’s potential to shape the next era of high-performance, reliable, and maintainable software.</p>
<h2 id="synadias-mission-connecting-everything">Synadia’s Mission: Connecting Everything</h2>
<p>At <strong>Synadia</strong>, we help some of the world’s largest enterprises design and scale innovative architectures across cloud regions, cloud providers, and all the way to the far edge. Often described as a “decentralized nervous system,” we enable secure, reliable communication between services and data, no matter the environment or topology - so our customers can deliver incredible digital products and experiences.</p>
<p>From the beginning, our mission has been bold yet simple: to <strong>connect everything</strong>. Built on top of <a href="http://NATS.io">NATS.io</a>, our platform enables organizations to modernize, digitize, and extend their systems all the way to the edge. Synadia’s technology enables organizations to build and scale microservices, streaming and telemetry platforms, and event sourcing systems, while leveraging modern data primitives such as key-value and object stores anywhere within those systems.</p>
<p>Our customers span industries from <strong>financial services</strong> and <strong>e-commerce</strong> to <strong>gaming</strong>, <strong>manufacturing</strong>, <strong>industrial IoT</strong>, <strong>connected and autonomous vehicles</strong>, <strong>energy systems</strong>, and <strong>embodied AI</strong>. They continually challenge us to push the limits of what’s possible - delivering secure, real-time communications and data movement anywhere with minimal overhead.</p>

<p>Beyond the language itself, the most impressive aspect of Zig has been the quality of projects built with it: <strong>TigerBeetle</strong>, <strong>Bun</strong>, <strong>Ghostty</strong>, and others. Among these, <strong>TigerBeetle</strong> stands out.</p>
<p>I first met <strong>Joran Dirk Greef</strong>, TigerBeetle’s founder, at the first <em>Distributed Systems Conference</em> in Cape Town, which they hosted. Since then, I’ve had the chance to see how Joran and his team approach engineering for their financial database product, guided by their philosophy called <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md">“TigerStyle.”</a> It focuses on correctness, clarity, and reliability — values that deeply resonate with us at Synadia and our customers.</p>
<p>Our goals align closely. Synadia is building industrial-grade solutions designed for smaller, more efficient, and deterministic deployments. Like TigerBeetle, we believe software should be predictable, simple, and trustworthy by design.</p>
<p>When Joran and I met again in New York recently, he told me TigerBeetle would be increasing its support for the Zig Foundation and asked whether Synadia would like to join forces. I didn’t have to think twice. There’s no better company or person to partner with in supporting Zig.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-the-zig-software-foundation">Supporting the Zig Software Foundation</h2>
<p>We are grateful to <strong>Andrew Kelley</strong>, the founder and president of the Zig Software Foundation, whose leadership continues to inspire developers building serious systems software. Andrew’s cohesive and focused vision mirrors how we operate at Synadia.</p>
<p>We’re proud to support <strong>Andrew</strong>, <strong>Loris Cro</strong>, and <strong>the entire Zig community</strong> as they continue to advance the state of systems programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Zig’s approach to control, performance, and simplicity is redefining what’s possible in modern systems software. We’re honored to contribute alongside TigerBeetle to help the Zig Foundation continue this vital work.”
— Derek Collison, Founder &amp; CEO, Synadia</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re delighted to stand with Synadia in supporting Zig’s growth. Together, we believe Zig will play a foundational role in the next generation of reliable distributed systems.”
— Joran Dirk Greef, Founder &amp; CEO, TigerBeetle</p>
