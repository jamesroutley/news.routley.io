    <p>12 February, 2023</p>
    <p>I have explained what I’m about to do in different ways to many different people over the past few weeks. Sometimes I say I’m going on an extended vacation, but it’s more than that. Other times I say I’m going on sabbatical, and that sounds weird because I’m not in academia; engineers don’t take sabbaticals. Often times I express that I’m making a career shift, though clearly not a seismic one since I’m not leaving my job. No matter how I swing it, this is the truth: I’m going to spend the next six weeks interacting remotely with creative and curious programmers of all skill levels, as we embark on our individual and self-guided journeys to program at the edge of our abilities.</p>
<p>I’ve never been great at explaining myself, and the paths I’ve taken in life have been anything but typical. Nobody at my organization had heard of the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> before I announced that I would be disappearing for several weeks to do this thing, which in hindsight is an even better reason to go and do it.</p>
<p>“I heard you were doing a coding bootcamp,” more than one person has said to me. “It’s kind of like that,” I reply. But it isn’t really. One pays thousands of dollars for a bootcamp, which usually has a pre-defined curriculum, a certificate of completion that can be added to one’s resume, as well as some form of temporary community of students who are doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Recurse Center isn’t that. It’s a strong and permanent community with a motto of, “never graduate!” and they have no predefined curriculum or certificates. Any curriculum or goals are meant to be completely self-derived, with the core tenants being to flex one’s volitional muscles, work at the edge of your ability, and to learn generously.</p>
<p>For me, the biggest draw of Recurse Center is getting to work with and learn from others. My self-perceived weakness as a programmer is the fact that nearly all the work I’ve done to date has been a solo endeavor. This isn’t to say I’m a poor team player; I’ve been a leader of and a member of successful teams in my career for years. But the ins and outs of collaborating on software projects are quite different. I think software engineers have considerably better collaboration tools &amp; practices than the rest of us. This makes me both want to be a software engineer, and perhaps bring these practices back to the non-software world.</p>
<p>One of the things that excites me most about my time at the Recurse Center is that I get to structure it exactly how I choose. For me, this means sticking to a consistent schedule every day. Waking up early, meditation, and an hour alone with Donald Knuth’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112247.The_Art_of_Computer_Programming_Volume_1">The Art of Computer Programming</a> . This is followed by daily check-ins with my colleagues at 8 AM, after which the real work can begin.</p>
<p>I’ll finish the programming day by around 3 PM, and take time to exercise and clear my head. The rest of the afternoon will be for taking hikes with my daughter and my dog, and for being with family. To me, all of this sounds like a dream vacation.</p>
<p>What’s missing from this daily routine, of course, is what happens in the middle: what the heck am I actually going to <em>do</em>?</p>
<h2 id="will-it-make-me-a-better-programmer">Will it Make me a Better Programmer?</h2>
<p>This is one question I’ve been advised to ask when choosing an activity. As it stands, I already have more projects in mind and subjects I’d like to explore than I’ll have time for in six weeks. Multiply this by the dozens of insanely bright and creative people I’ll be interacting with daily, and their own projects and curiosities, and it will be easy to become overwhelmed. As one recurser said to me, people spend the first few weeks just figuring out what’s going on, what everyone else is doing.</p>
<p>So how to go about gauging whether an activity is worth doing? A few questions I’ll be asking myself:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Will this make me a better programmer?</strong> Yes, it’s very subjective, and that’s the point. Intuition is allowed to be a strong driver here.</li>
<li><strong>Is this pushing me to the edge of my ability</strong>? Do I feel slightly intimidated by it? Can I maybe not do it? Then it’s worth doing.</li>
<li><strong>Am I working on this alone or with others?</strong> Pair programming is an important part of Recurse Center, and as mentioned above, collaboration with others, whether real-time or asynchronous, is one of the main areas I want to improve. Nearly everyone who finishes Recurse Center says they wish they had done more pair programming.</li>
<li><strong>Will I have the opportunity to work on this skill in a professional context?</strong> If the answer is yes, I should consider waiting until I return to my real job to pursue it. I should use the time in Recurse Center to work on skills that may not make “professional sense” in the short-term.</li>
<li><strong>Will this help me learn generously?</strong> If not pushing me to the edge of my own ability, working with others and helping them find their edge is a good use of time. Sharing insights and lessons learned is part of learning together.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-table-of-time">The Table of Time</h2>
<p>I have a habit of tracking my time in somewhat excruciating detail. I <a href="https://github.com/blairfrandeen/titr">built a command line app for this purpose</a>, which I plan to augment during my time at Recurse Center. I’ll use this as another tool to create a big-picture plan for how I’ll spend my time, and aim to stick to that plan as closely as is reasonable.</p>
<p>I look at this in a few different lenses: overall percentage of time spent, total hours, and average daily hours. I took some time to tune the table below to match what I personally feel would constitute success:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>There are six weeks, and there are 40 hours in a week. Realistically that represents a minimum amount of time that I will put into this, and it also means that I don’t consider myself a failure if I don’t do any more than that.</p>
<p>I’ve aligned my goals here strongly towards the social aspects of this retreat, with over 50% of my time dedicated to activities that involve others. Of course, this introvert can’t help but dedicate healthy amounts of time for reflection and individual deep work.</p>
<h2 id="turning-point">Turning Point</h2>
<p>When my boss asked me what I wanted to work on when I returned, I told her that I will be firmly on the spectrum between “never want to touch a computer again” and “don’t want to do anything but program.” I’m guessing I’ll land on the latter half of that spectrum. What I am almost certain of is that I will see programming, my career, and how these two fit together in a much different light when I finish my time at the Recurse Center.</p>
<p>I’m about to embark on a leg of my journey that I won’t soon forget. I’m ready for this experience to transform me in ways that I never expected. If I’m on the right track, tomorrow will mark a significant turning point in my career towards work that I find more meaningful and fulfilling.</p>
