<p><em>Nature</em> has retracted a 2002 paper from the lab of Catherine Verfaillie purporting to show a type of adult stem cell could, under certain circumstances, “contribute to most, if not all, somatic cell types.” </p>



<p>The retracted article, “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature00870">Pluripotency of mesenchymal stem cells derived from adult marrow</a>,” has been <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1024602878849692040">controversial since its publication</a>. Still, it has been cited nearly 4,500 times, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science – making it by far <a href="https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-leaderboard/top-10-most-highly-cited-retracted-papers/">the most-cited retracted paper ever</a>.</p>



<p>In 2007, <em>New Scientist</em> reported on questions about <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325915-200-flawed-stem-cell-data-withdrawn/">data in the <em>Nature</em> paper</a> and <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19325964-600-fresh-questions-on-stem-cell-findings/">another</a> of Verfaille’s <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/98/9/2615/53471/Purification-and-ex-vivo-expansion-of-postnatal">articles in <em>Blood</em></a>. <em>Nature </em><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05812">published a correction</a> that year. </p>



<p>The errors the authors corrected “do not alter the conclusions of the Article,” they wrote in the notice. </p>



<p>The University of Minnesota-Twin Cities in Minneapolis, where Verfaillie worked when the <em>Nature</em> paper was published, in 2008 found the <em>Blood</em> paper <a href="https://archive.ph/20120712090732/http://jobs.chronicle.com/article/U-of-Minnesota-Panel-Says/41756/">contained falsified images</a>, but Verfaillie was not responsible for the manipulations. <em>Blood</em> <a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/113/10/2370/24360/Reyes-M-Lund-T-Lenvik-T-Aguiar-D-Koodie-L">retracted the article</a> in 2009 at the request of the authors. </p>



<p>Verfaillie moved to KU Leuven, where she is now an <a href="https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/person/00048658">emeritus professor</a>. She has not responded to our request for comment. </p>



<p>KU Leuven conducted an investigation of Verfaillie’s work in 2019-2020, after Elisabeth Bik posted questions about the data in her papers, including <a href="https://pubpeer.com/publications/DF95522E3585E37663CAD1972E70BD#">the one from 2002 in <em>Nature</em></a>, on PubPeer. The <a href="https://nieuws.kuleuven.be/en/content/2020/ku-leuven-completes-research-on-possible-breach-of-research-integrity">university found</a> “no breach of research integrity in the publications investigated.” </p>



<p>Bik tweeted about the retraction: </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OMG <a href="https://twitter.com/Nature?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Nature</a> just retracted one of the Verfaillie papers <a href="https://twitter.com/UMNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UMNews</a>, 4.5 years after I reported it.</p>— Elisabeth Bik (@MicrobiomDigest) <a href="https://twitter.com/MicrobiomDigest/status/1802841374427087297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The notice mentions two image duplications Bik wrote about on PubPeer. Because the authors could not retrieve the original images, it states: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>the Editors no longer have confidence that the conclusion that multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs) engraft in the bone marrow is supported.</p>



<p>Given the concerns above the Editors no longer have confidence in the reliability of the data reported in this article.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to the notice, most of the authors, including Verfaillie, agreed with the retraction. She now has four retractions, by <a href="http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx#?auth%3dVerfaillie%252c%2bCatherine%2bM">our count</a>.</p>
