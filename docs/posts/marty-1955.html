    <h1>Marty (1955)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p>Watched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_(film)"><em>Marty</em></a> last night, a low-key story about a lonely butcher in the Bronx. I loved the back-and-forth between the title character and his friend trying to figure out what to do on a Saturday night, the characters of his mother and aunt, and this line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ma, whaddaya want from me? Whaddaya want from me? I’m miserable enough as it is. All right, so I’ll go to the Stardust Ballroom. I’ll put on a blue suit, and I’ll go. And you know what I’m gonna get for my trouble? Heartache. A big night of heartache.</p>
