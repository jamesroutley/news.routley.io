      <p>A while back I had the opportunity to work with Common Lisp professionally. As has happened to many before and after me, a lot of the powerful features of Common Lisp and its implementations made me a little drunk on power for a while, but I quickly recovered.</p>
<p>Some things stuck with me, however. Among them was <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/m_setf_.htm#setf"><code>setf</code></a>, which feels similar yet different to another concept that I quite adore: <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Lets_Build_Lenses_in_Carp.html">Lenses</a>.</p>
<p>As with lenses and many other concepts before them, I decided to try to understand <code>setf</code> more deeply by implementing it in Carp. <a href="https://github.com/carp-lang/Carp/pull/1192">The final pull request</a> to the Carp standard library got rejected—by myself, no less!—, but <a href="https://github.com/carpentry-org/setf/">the library lives on</a>!</p>
<p>In this blog post, we’re going to look at how to implement <code>setf</code> together. It’s going to be an interesting riff on what we did when we implemented <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Carp_and_derive_II:_This_Time_Its_Personal.html"><code>derive</code></a>.</p>
<p>Sit tight, and grab a drink! It’s follow-along time!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-setf-anyway">What is <code>setf</code>, anyway?</h2>
<p>To know how to implement it, maybe we should get acquainted with <code>setf</code> first.</p>
<p>To understand <code>setf</code>, we should first talk about “places”. Places are the name for the getter functions that we use as descriptors to tell <code>setf</code> what to update. For instance, we could do:</p>
<pre><code>(def x [1 2 3])
(setf (nth &amp;x 1) 4) ; =&gt; [1 4 3]</code></pre>
<p>The place here would be <code>nth</code>. The magic here is that, by convention, the setter is named after an existing getter function, so it feels as if <code>setf</code> magically knows how to transform a getter into a setter.</p>
<p>You can also register your own places. For Carp, I chose to implement three such functions:</p>
<pre><code>; register-place takes a name and a function that,
; given the arguments, knows how to transform them
; into a call to the setter
(register-place &#39;nth
                (fn [args] `(Array.aset! %@args)))

; register-simple-place is a simple abstraction
; that takes a name and the function that it
; should be rewritten to
(register-simple-place &#39;nth &#39;Array.aset!)

; register-struct-places takes a type and creates
; places for all its members
(register-struct-places &#39;Vector2)

(let-do [x (Vector2.init 1 2)]
  (setf (Vector2.x &amp;x) 10)
  x) ; =&gt; (Vector2 10 2)</code></pre>
<p>Given these parameters, implementing <code>setf</code> should be easy! Let’s do this!</p>
<h2 id="implementing-setf">Implementing <code>setf</code></h2>
<p>First, we need a place—no pun intended—to store our places. Since it’s going to be a mapping from names to functions, a hashmap seems like a good data structure. Let’s call it <code>places</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(defdynamic places {})</code></pre>
<p>Next up, let’s define the registration functions.</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic register-place [name builder]
  (set! places (Map.put places name builder)))

(defndynamic register-simple-place [name setter]
  (register-place name
                  (fn [args] (cons setter args))))</code></pre>
<p><code>register-place</code> will simply update the <code>places</code> map. <code>register-simple-place</code> will build upon this by building a function that just puts the setter in front of all the arguments received.</p>
<p>As might be expected, <code>register-struct-places</code> is a little more involved.</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic register-struct-places [t]
  (map
    (fn [member]
      (let [name (car member)
            getter (Symbol.prefix t name)
            setter (Symbol.prefix t
                                  (Symbol.concat [
                                    &#39;set- name &#39;!
                                  ]))]
        (register-simple-place getter setter)))
    (members t)))</code></pre>
<p>In the end, we just iterate over the members of the type and use <code>register-simple-place</code> to tie together the getters and setters that the compiler autogenerates for us. For a <code>Vector</code> type with an <code>x</code> coordinate, for instance, the appropriate pair will be <code>Vector.x</code> and <code>Vector.set-x</code>.</p>
<p>For convenience, we define a function to get a place from the map:</p>
<pre><code>(defndynamic get-place [n]
    (Map.get places n))</code></pre>
<p>This is really just a simple wrapper around map retrieval.</p>
<p>Now that we have all the plumbing for registration in place, we can finally implement the main event, i.e. the <code>setf</code> macro. It is the most intricate part of the puzzle, but most of its complexity comes from error handling. As such, let’s look at a naïve implementation first:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro setf [place val]
   (let [setter (get-place (car place))]
      (setter (cons-last val (cdr place)))))</code></pre>
<p>We get the setter function, and then apply it to the rest of the form, with the new value appended. This means that <code>(setf (nth &amp;x 1) 10)</code> will be given to the setter registered under <code>nth</code> as <code>(&amp;x 1 10)</code>. This happens to match the signature of <code>Array.aset!</code> perfectly, so we can register it as a pass-through, i.e. a <code>simple-place</code>.</p>
<p>Now, to enable setting variables, we use a trick: we transform it into a list or <code>(sym &lt;variable&gt;)</code> and register <code>set!</code> as a <code>simple-place</code>, meaning that <code>(setf x 10)</code> will first be transformed to <code>(setf (sym x) 10)</code>, and then to <code>(set! x 10)</code>. To enable that behavior, we have to change <code>setf</code> a little:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro setf [place val]
  (let [place (if (symbol? place) `(sym %place) place)
        setter (get-place (car place))]
    (setter (cons-last val (cdr place)))))</code></pre>
<p>Alright, all that’s left is handling errors gracefully. First, let’s make sure we give a good error message when a place isn’t known:</p>
<pre><code>(defmacro setf [place val]
  (let [place (if (symbol? place) `(sym %place) place)
        key (car place)
        setter? (get-place key)]
    (if (= nil setter?)
        (macro-error
          (list
            &#34;I didn’t find a `setf` place for &#34; key
            &#34;. Is it defined?&#34;))
        (setter? (cons-last val (cdr place))))))</code></pre>
<p>Since <code>Map.get</code> will return <code>nil</code> when the key doesn’t exist, we can just check for that and move on. Now there is only one error case left that we have to deal with: garbage input.</p>
<pre><code>(defdynamic malformed (gensym-with &#39;place-malformed))

(defmacro setf [place val]
  (let [place (if (symbol? place) `(sym %place) place)
        key (if (and (list? place)
                     (not (empty? place))
                     (symbol? (car place)))
               (car place)
               malformed)
        setter? (get-place key)]
    (cond
      (= key malformed)
        (macro-error
          (list
            &#34;The `setf` place &#34; place
            &#34; is malformed. Expected a list or symbol.&#34;))
      (= nil setter?)
        (macro-error
          (list
            &#34;I didn’t find a `setf` place for &#34; key
            &#34;. Is it defined?&#34;))
        (setter? (cons-last val (cdr place))))))</code></pre>
<p>We introduce a special symbol to signal that the place that was put in was not a non-empty list that starts with a symbol. Any non-empty list that has a symbol as its first element could potentially be a valid place, anything else is invalid.</p>
<p>And that’s all we need to do to define <code>setf</code>!</p>

<p>If you followed my <a href="https://blog.veitheller.de/Carp_and_derive_II:_This_Time_Its_Personal.html"><code>derive</code></a> journey, a lot of the ground we covered today should be familiar territory. If you didn’t—and also if you did!—, I hope you enjoyed our little journey, maybe learned a thing or two, and got inspired to play around with the concepts a bit on your own time.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>
