<p data-block-key="3pdd9">I tag blog posts rather erratically, and keep meaning to go back and systematically taxonomize my thousands of past posts. One thing that <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2021/switched-to-a-new-blogging-platform/">my new blogging platform</a> includes is another way to highlight particular posts for attention: individual &#34;collections&#34; of posts listed on <a href="http://harihareswara.net/collections/">the &#34;Collections&#34; page</a>, which is prominently linked on the top navbar of the site.</p><p data-block-key="53eo">Last week I went through about nine years&#39; worth of archives to add posts to a few collections, which you might enjoy browsing:</p><ul><li data-block-key="fcarl"><a href="http://harihareswara.net/collections/sometimes-silly-ideas/">Sometimes-silly ideas</a>: I often dream up business or project ideas. Often theyâ€™re silly. Often I have no intention of executing on these ideas. Feel free to implement them. Caution: several are probably pretty bad!</li><li data-block-key="9bvlj"><a href="http://harihareswara.net/collections/fundamental-ways-i-think-about-things/">Fundamental ways I think about things</a>: These posts illustrate some of the underlying beliefs, habits, and approaches that undergird how I reason and act.</li><li data-block-key="4f1oj"><a href="http://harihareswara.net/collections/detailed-instructions/">Detailed instructions</a>: Systematic how-to explanations on a variety of topics.</li></ul><p data-block-key="ec8du">Also, for some of you, because of some missing or misconfigured redirect rules, my <a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/rss/">RSS</a> and <a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/atom/">Atom</a> feeds broke last year, argh. I have now remedied that and a few category-specific RSS feeds, so that&#39;s why you&#39;ve suddenly gotten my recent posts in your feedreader. Sorry for the hiatus and the clutter! And I am working to switch over to full-text feeds at some point, soon, I hope.</p>
