        <p>Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, have developed a new, easily manufacturable solid-state thermoelectric refrigeration technology with nano-engineered materials that is twice as efficient as devices made with commercially available bulk thermoelectric materials. As global demand grows for more energy-efficient, reliable and compact cooling solutions, this advancement offers a scalable alternative to traditional compressor-based refrigeration.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59698-y">paper published in Nature Communications</a> on May 21, 2025, a team of researchers from APL and refrigeration engineers from Samsung Research demonstrated improved heat-pumping efficiency and capacity in refrigeration systems attributable to high-performance nano-engineered thermoelectric materials invented at APL known as controlled hierarchically engineered superlattice structures (CHESS).</p><p>The CHESS technology is the result of 10 years of APL research in advanced nano-engineered thermoelectric materials and applications development. Initially developed for national security applications, the material has also been used for <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/230727a-apl-noninvasive-cold-restoration-phantom-limbs">noninvasive cooling therapies</a> for prosthetics and won an <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/230823a-apl-wins-2023-rd100-award">R&amp;D 100 award</a> in 2023.</p><p>“This real-world demonstration of refrigeration using new thermoelectric materials showcases the capabilities of nano-engineered CHESS thin films,” said <a href="https://www.jhuapl.edu/about/people/rama-venkatasubramanian" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc615f1f-adba-4f68-a69a-0ac674735d98" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Rama Venkatasubramanian">Rama Venkatasubramanian</a>, principal investigator of the joint project and chief technologist for thermoelectrics at APL. “It marks a significant leap in cooling technology and sets the stage for translating advances in thermoelectric materials into practical, large-scale, energy-efficient refrigeration applications.”</p>
