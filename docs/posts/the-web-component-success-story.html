    <h1>The Web Component Success Story</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-content="" data-astro-cid-rnrqlda2=""> <p>Tom MacWright wrote a short post wondering <a href="https://macwright.com/2024/01/24/on-web-components" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">why we don‚Äôt see prominent applications using web components</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://macwright.com/2024/01/24/on-web-components" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">On Web Components</span>  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://macwright.com/css/favicon.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">macwright.com/2024/01/24/on-web-components</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs a fair question!
It‚Äôs easy to see the success of frameworks like React and Rails: just look at the thousands of websites built with them.
What does the web component success story look like?</p>
<p>Contrary to some people, I don‚Äôt see web components on their own as a huge productivity boon for individual websites.
Once you‚Äôve bought into a particular set of technologies, it makes sense to use it for as much as you can.
If you have a React app, you‚Äôd be justifiably skeptical of introducing a second way to build components!</p>
<p>Rather, the biggest benefits I see are <em>collective</em>, cutting across the industry as a whole.
I think web components can make the entire web more accessible.
They have the potential to unify currently fragmented communities, including various JavaScript frameworks <em>and</em> those who avoid them.</p>
<p>I know that‚Äôs an audacious pitch, but bear with me.</p>
<h3 id="javascript-framework-interop">JavaScript Framework Interop</h3>
<p>Whenever I write about web components, I see pushback from people in the JavaScript community who seem to think that I want replace to JavaScript frameworks.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre in that camp, let me assuage those fears: the web component success story emphatically does <em>not</em> involve rewriting every React app using web components.
As I‚Äôll continue to say, web components and JavaScript frameworks are <em>complementary</em> (as opposed to <em>competing</em>) technologies.
In fact, I think JavaScript framework apps will be one of the most common places in which web components are used!</p>
<p>Does that mean we‚Äôll all start writing web components in addition to React components?
Not at all.
When I say that web components will be used in JavaScript framework apps, I‚Äôm talking about third-party libraries.</p>
<p>JavaScript frameworks are tools, all tools have tradeoffs, yada yada, let‚Äôs skip the preamble.
I want to talk about one specific weakness of JavaScript frameworks: interoperability, or the lack thereof.
Almost without exception, each framework can only render components written for that framework specifically.</p>
<p>As a result, the JavaScript community tends to fragment itself along framework lines.
Switching frameworks has a high cost, especially when moving to a less popular one; it means leaving most of the third-party ecosystem behind.</p>
<p>That switching cost stunts framework innovation by heavily favoring incumbents with large ecosystems.
It‚Äôs hard to create new frameworks, because each one has to start its own ecosystem from scratch.
We keep rebuilding the same set of primitives over and over and over again.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs a famous Joel Spolsky blog post about <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">why capitalistic tech companies contribute to open source</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.joelonsoftware.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/11969842.jpg?fit=400%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Strategy Letter V</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">When I was in college I took two intro economics courses: macroeconomics and microeconomics.

Briefly: every product has <em>substitutes</em> (products that can replace it) and <em>complements</em> (products that can be used alongside it).
The big takeaway is that ‚Äù<strong>smart companies try to commoditize their products‚Äô complements</strong>‚Äù.
In other words, they try to make it so that their own product has a proprietary advantage, while the products used alongside it are all cheap and interchangeable.</p>
<p>Back to JavaScript frameworks.
React and Svelte are substitutes, while React and Radix are complements.
As a library author, the way to commoditize your complement is to make it work with as many frameworks as possible.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-reactnative" id="user-content-fnref-reactnative" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup>
And unlike in Native Land ‚Äî where people have collectively spent billions of dollars over decades developing write-once run-anywhere environments ‚Äî the web has one built in.</p>
<p>Maybe you‚Äôve heard of it?
It‚Äôs called HTML, and it works with <a href="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">every Javascript framework</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/images/card.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Custom Elements Everywhere</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Making sure frameworks and custom elements can be BFFs üçª</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/images/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">custom-elements-everywhere.com</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>.
For all their warts, the fact that web components get this interoperability for free is a <em>ridiculously powerful advantage</em>, and libraries that don‚Äôt exploit it are leaving a lot of potential users on the table.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a concrete example.
<a href="https://www.xyflow.com" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">xyflow</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://www.xyflow.com" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://xyflow.com/img/og/xyflow.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Node Based UIs for React and Svelte ‚Äì xyflow</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Powerful open source libraries for building node-based UIs with React or Svelte.

It was originally called React Flow, but the maintainers renamed it when they added Svelte support.
<a href="https://www.xyflow.com/blog/why-svelte-flow" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">They had to put in a ton of work just to support that <em>one</em>  extra framework</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://www.xyflow.com/blog/why-svelte-flow" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://xyflow.com/img/og/xyflow.jpg" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Why Svelte Flow? ‚Äì xyflow</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">xyflow - Customizable library for rendering workflows, diagrams and node-based UIs.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://xyflow.com/img/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">www.xyflow.com/blog/why-svelte-flow</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>!
And if you use Vue, Angular, Solid, Qwik or Ember, you‚Äôre still out of luck.</p>
<p>React has enjoyed continued success because it has a moat of fantastic third-party libraries: Radix, React Aria, React Three Fiber, Framer Motion and xyflow, among many others.
Web components have the potential to give us that same ecosystem ‚Äî but for <em>every</em> framework.</p>
<h3 id="islands-of-interactivity">Islands of Interactivity</h3>
<p>Of course, plenty of websites don‚Äôt use JavaScript frameworks.
Hypermedia-centric approaches (read: how websites were built before circa 2010) are making a resurgence, led by libraries such as htmx.</p>
<p>Many websites like this still incorporate highly dynamic elements.
Often, these take the form of rich widgets that are missing from HTML, like menus and combo boxes.
Sometimes they‚Äôre even more complicated, like interactive diagrams in articles.
The modern term for these dynamic regions within an otherwise static page is ‚Äúislands of interactivity‚Äù, but the pattern has existed for a long time.</p>
<p>Embedding these islands within the larger page has always been kinda awkward.
The process remains mostly unchanged from the days of jQuery plugins, relying on a complex choreography of HTML classes, CSS selectors and JavaScript function calls.
The bulk of the setup happens in a separate JavaScript file, far away from the HTML where the component will live on the page.</p>
<p>Web components invert that process.
They allow islands to be instantiated in the same way as any other element: by writing a tag name in the page‚Äôs markup.
As I wrote in <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/the-website-vs-web-app-dichotomy-doesnt-exist/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">The Website vs. Web App Dichotomy Doesn‚Äôt Exist</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/the-website-vs-web-app-dichotomy-doesnt-exist/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/og/the-website-vs-web-app-dichotomy-doesnt-exist.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">The Website vs. Web App Dichotomy Doesn&#39;t Exist | jakelazaroff.com</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">A one-dimensional spectrum can&#39;t sufficiently capture the tradeoffs involved in web development.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">jakelazaroff.com/words/the-website-vs-web-app-dichotomy-doesnt-exist/</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>, web components allow developers to declaratively add dynamic behavior to HTML itself.</p>
<p>What makes web components particularly good companions for hypermedia-oriented libraries is the way they interact with other parts of the page.
While JavaScript framework components tend to do so by invoking callback functions, web components instead embrace one of the web‚Äôs core idioms: events. <sup><a href="#user-content-fn-target" id="user-content-fnref-target" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup>
Indeed, Carson Gross‚Äôs essay <a href="https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-friendly-scripting/#events" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Hypermedia-Friendly Scripting</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-friendly-scripting/#events" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">&lt;/&gt; htmx ~ Hypermedia-Friendly Scripting</span>  <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://htmx.org/favicon.ico#events" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-friendly-scripting/#events</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a> neatly outlines this use case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A JavaScript-based component that triggers events allows for hypermedia-oriented JavaScript libraries, such as htmx, to listen for those events and trigger hypermedia exchanges. This, in turn, makes any JavaScript library a potential hypermedia control, able to drive the Hypermedia-Driven Application via user-selected actions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an example, here‚Äôs a TIL I wrote on <a href="https://til.jakelazaroff.com/htmx/load-modal-content-when-shoelace-dialog-opens/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">using htmx and the Shoelace web component library to load the content of a dialog when it opens</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://til.jakelazaroff.com/htmx/load-modal-content-when-shoelace-dialog-opens/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://til.jakelazaroff.com/og/htmx/load-modal-content-when-shoelace-dialog-opens.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">[htmx] Load modal content when a Shoelace dialog opens | Today I Learned</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">A collection of useful things I&#39;ve learned.</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://til.jakelazaroff.com/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">til.jakelazaroff.com/htmx/load-modal-content-when-shoelace-dialog-opens/</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"> <use href="/icons.svg#share"></use> </svg> </span> </a>.
Notice how the whole process ‚Äî from instantiating the dialog component, to requesting the content when the modal opens, to inserting it into the appropriate place in the DOM ‚Äî is controlled declaratively via markup.</p>

This debate is getting more and more intense every day, bringing division in a community that used to be immune to this kind of ‚Äúwars‚Äù.

This talk is my attempt to bring peace between the two fronts. To help these two opposite factions to understand and listen to each other, see the counterpart&#39;s points of views. To find the good things they have in common, and learn something from that.

<h3 id="no-more-silos">No More Silos</h3>
<p>These sound like separate problems, but they‚Äôre actually two sides of the same coin.
With web components, the library that works in every JavaScript framework <em>also</em> works as an island of interactivity on a static webpage.
Even HTML web components fit into both niches.</p>
<p>Brad Frost has called for <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-global-design-system/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">a global design system</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/a-global-design-system/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""> <img src="https://bradfrost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/CleanShot-2023-11-02-at-13.53.24.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""/> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">A Global Design System</span> <span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">TL;DR: This is a call to action to create a Global Design System that provides the world&#39;s web designers &amp; developers a library of common UI components.

It‚Äôs an ambitious goal, and from where I stand web components are by far the best way to achieve it.</p>
<p>Web components won‚Äôt take web development by storm, or show us the One True Way to build websites.
They don‚Äôt need to dethrone JavaScript frameworks.
We probably won‚Äôt even all learn how to write them!</p>
<p>What web components <em>will</em> do ‚Äî at least, I hope ‚Äî is let us collectively build a rich ecosystem of dynamic components that work with any web stack.
No more silos.
That‚Äôs the web component success story.</p>
