    <h1>Ask HN: Can web scraping be the basis of a viable business model?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I&#39;m a data engineer at heart, and I never did or enjoyed front-end work. Having said that I always was happy to code and evolve crawlers and web scrapers. Now I&#39;ve taken some time off from work and gigs and I&#39;m working on a  side-project  I&#39;ve been hacking for some time.<p>Without getting into the details yet: it aims to make web data collection a little bit easier for non-devs. I&#39;ll soon have an MVP and will start pitching to investors: aiming for an open-source business model (after a few months of stealth development) and eventually a typical SaaS offering for extra functionality.</p><p>At this point I&#39;m trying to consolidate and counter the steel-man counter-arguments I should expect from investors.  The most obvious one: as one can imagine, the product it&#39;s not magic and, after a certain point it does require some manual work from the customer, hence this is an aspect I should prepare for.</p><p>I have done some preliminary analysis of the space of potential competitors (think import.io, Apify, Zyte/ScarpingHub, etc.) and described opportunities for differentiation. What I&#39;m afraid of is getting sidetracked in a discussion of &#34;um, this is web scraping and it&#39;s hard to make a business on top of it&#34;.</p><p>I understand that there&#39;s not much context now and one could easily say &#34;well yeah, anything could be possible with a good team, product...&#34;, but I&#39;m reaching out to the HN community to gather some considerations, mental models and pointers, I may not think of myself at this point.</p></td></div></div>
