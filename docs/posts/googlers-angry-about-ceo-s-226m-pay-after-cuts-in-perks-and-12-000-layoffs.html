<p>Following <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/google-cuts-12000-jobs-the-largest-layoff-in-the-companys-history/">Google&#39;s layoff</a> of 12,000 employees and other cost-cutting moves, employees are reportedly expressing anger about CEO Sundar Pichai&#39;s $226 million pay package.</p>
<p>&#34;In the weeks since Pichai&#39;s annual compensation was made public, internal Google platforms have filled with conversations and memes slamming the CEO for taking a pay bump while slashing costs elsewhere,&#34; <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/03/google-employees-complain-about-ceo-sundar-pichais-pay-raise.html">CNBC reported yesterday</a>. CNBC&#39;s report said internal memes shared by employees also criticized Google owner Alphabet&#39;s recent <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2023Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf">authorization of a $70 billion</a> stock repurchase program, the same amount as <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2022Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf">last year</a>. Pichai is the CEO of both Alphabet and Google.</p>
<p>According to CNBC, one &#34;popular meme showed an image of <em>Shrek</em> character Lord Farquaad with the text &#39;Sundar accepting $226 million while laying off 12k Googlers, cutting perks, and destroying morale and culture.&#39;&#34; It also included the Farquaad quote, &#34;some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice I am willing to make.&#34;</p>
<p>The median Alphabet employee was paid $279,802 in 2022. Although Alphabet lists Pichai&#39;s 2022 compensation as $226 million, most of it will vest over three years, and the amount could change. The total value is lower than the triennial award he got for the previous three-year period.</p>
<h2>“We respect shareholders more than Googlers”</h2>
<p>One meme with over 700 likes read, &#34;$70 billion in buybacks shows we respect external shareholders more than Googlers,&#34; according to CNBC. There were also reportedly memes &#34;comparing Pichai to Apple CEO Tim Cook, who in January received over a 40 percent cut from his 2022 target total compensation.&#34;</p>
<p>Cook <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/apple-ceo-tim-cook-to-take-40-pay-cut-this-year/">requested a pay cut</a> that dropped his target compensation to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000130817923000019/laap2023_def14a.htm">$49 million</a> in 2023. In 2022, Cook&#39;s target compensation was $84 million, but he ended up receiving $99.4 million.</p>
<p>CNBC said it viewed over a dozen memes shared in Google&#39;s internal discussion forums, including one &#34;with more than 1,200 likes [that] referred to comments from finance chief Ruth Porat, who wrote last month in a rare companywide email that the company is making &#39;multi-year&#39; cuts to employee services.&#34;</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>&#34;Ruth&#39;s cost savings applied to everyone… except our hardworking VPs and CEO,&#34; the meme reportedly said. The spending cuts announced by Porat <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/03/google-to-cut-down-on-employee-laptops-services-and-staplers-to-save.html">reportedly target</a> office supplies, laptop replacements, fitness classes, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-cfo-signals-more-spending-cuts-to-meet-savings-targets-3c4b9722">snack bars, cafeterias</a>, and more.</p>
<p>When contacted by Ars, a Google spokesperson declined to comment on the report of employee complaints.</p>
<p>After Google&#39;s January announcement of 12,000 layoffs, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-layoffs-shatter-aura-of-stability-abundance-allhands-meeting-2023-1">Pichai reportedly said</a> in a meeting with staff that Google executives would take a &#34;very significant reduction in their annual bonus.&#34; Pichai wrote in an <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/message-ceo/january-update/">email to employees</a> that &#34;I take full responsibility for the decisions that led us here,&#34; saying that over the past two years the company &#34;hired for a different economic reality than the one we face today.&#34; Alphabet had 190,234 employees at the end of 2022.</p>
<p>In Q1 2023, Alphabet <a href="https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2023Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf">reported</a> revenue of $69.8 billion and net income of $15.1 billion, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/alphabet-googl-q1-earnings-report-2023.html">outperforming analysts&#39; expectations</a>.</p>
<h2>CEO-to-worker pay ratio of 808:1</h2>
<p>Pichai&#39;s compensation includes a $218 million stock award that was granted in December 2022 and will vest over three years, according to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000130817923000736/lgoog2023_def14a.htm">regulatory filing</a>. The amount could change in value depending on the company&#39;s stock performance. Pichai&#39;s total pay in 2021 was listed as $6.3 million, and in 2020 it was $7.4 million.</p>
<p>Pichai&#39;s listed annual pay varies significantly because of the large stock awards he&#39;s granted once every three years. His 2019 pay was <a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/at-280m-alphabet-s-sundar-pichai-is-2019-s-highest-paid-us-info-tech-ceo-59872469">$280.6 million</a> and his 2016 pay was <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/28/google-ceo-sundar-pichais-compensation-doubled-in-2016-to-200-million.html">about $200 million</a>.</p>
<p>Alphabet reported that Pichai&#39;s 2022 compensation was 808 times more than the median employee&#39;s. &#34;Given that CEO equity awards are currently made on a triennial cadence, while our broad-based employee equity awards are typically made on an annual cadence, the pay ratio can fluctuate significantly across years. For example, our 2020 pay ratio was 27:1; our 2021 pay ratio was 21:1; and our 2022 pay ratio is 808:1,&#34; Alphabet&#39;s filing said.</p>
<p>Alphabet&#39;s CEO-to-employee ratio was <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000130817920000203/lgoog2020_def14a.htm">1,085:1 in 2019</a>, when Pichai was awarded $280.6 million and the median salary was $258,708. Apple reported a pay ratio in 2022 of 1,177:1. Apple&#39;s ratio is likely to drop in 2023 because of Cook&#39;s pay cut.</p>
<p>In a December 2022 <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000119312522310153/d441338d8k.htm">filing</a>, Alphabet said that the &#34;vesting of a significant portion of the award will depend on Alphabet&#39;s total shareholder return (relative to S&amp;P 100 companies), and this performance-based equity may not vest at all.&#34; Alphabet also said it increased the proportion of &#34;performance stock units&#34; in Pichai&#39;s pay package from 43 percent to 60 percent, and changed the S&amp;P 100 percentile target from the 50th percentile to the 55th percentile.</p>
<p>These changes will &#34;further align Mr. Pichai&#39;s compensation to long-term shareholder value creation and Alphabet&#39;s stock performance relative to the S&amp;P 100 over the applicable performance periods,&#34; the company said.</p>
