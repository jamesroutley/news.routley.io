<p>“The wall is a result of the hostile policy pursued by the USA and South Korea against unification,” exclaims Kim Chang Yun, a trusted colonel of the Korean People’s Army with over forty years service. Within earshot, I was otherwise preoccupied gazing intently down the twin barrels of 1990’s finest binoculars, panning for refracted light resembling that of the Concrete Wall, North Korea’s own fabled Loch Ness Monster.</p>
<p>I was on the front line of Korea’s Demilitarized Zone inside a cold stone bunker preceded by a crumbling overgrown trench laced with moss. To my left, a sandbagged outpost situated on the high ground manned by three Korean People’s Army soldiers, one was resting, leant up against a mounted machine gun.</p>
<p>Together, we all stared across into South Korea. The enemy. At least for the duration of my visit. Do as the Romans do, it’s never felt quite so important. By being inside North Korea it was my legal obligation.</p>
<p>“Do you see it?” I asked a fellow tourist, seeking solace in a majority decision.</p>
<p>“Not yet” he responded, optimistically.</p>
<p>What’s the big deal anyway? It’s just a wall, I hear you thinking. Well, the Concrete Wall spans 240 kilometres across the entire Korean peninsula, cutting it in half. Built by South Korea, it’s said to physically <em>segregate</em> the North <em>from</em> the South. The wall is 5-8 metres high, 10-19 metres thick and dotted with military establishments and lookouts. Think the Great Wall of China, except in Korea, and as relevant today as the one in China many moons ago.</p>
<p>Interestingly, North Korea’s exclusive news source named KCNA claims that the wall can only be seen from the North Korean side.</p>
<p>Whatever that means.</p>
<p>Yet, this was a claim backed equally by each of my five North Korean guides.</p>
