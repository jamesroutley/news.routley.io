  There&#39;s a corner of the Internet where people have been reclaiming
  their digital independence by hosting their own websites and
  promoting the idea of owning your own content—it&#39;s called the
  IndieWeb.  This community has its
  own <a href="https://indieweb.org/">website</a>, IRC channels,
  social media presence, etc.  This movement promotes the idea that
  individuals should control their own digital presence through
  personal websites.  But every time this topic comes up in online
  discussions, someone inevitably claims that the IndieWeb hasn&#39;t
  taken off!
</p>
<p>
  I feel that such claims about the IndieWeb not &#34;taking off&#34; are
  either stating the obvious or, if that&#39;s not the intention,
  completely missing the point.  It&#39;s like saying that gardening
  hasn&#39;t taken off because most people buy their vegetables at the
  supermarket.  The IndieWeb doesn&#39;t need to &#34;take off&#34; to be valuable
  to those who participate in it.  Maintaining a personal website is
  about owning your digital presence, embracing creative freedom, and
  expressing your individuality!  It&#39;s not about appealing to the
  masses!
</p>
<p>
  I remember how, in the early 2000s, I used to spend my spare time
  learning HTML and writing my website, one HTML tag at a time.
  Writing a few lines of code in a text editor and then watching the
  browser render that code into a vibrant web page full of colours and
  images felt like an art form.  It was doubly fun to find other
  netizens who shared that same joy of maintaining and publishing
  their websites.  The IndieWeb is about preserving that hacker
  culture where websites are crafted and hosted not for mass appeal
  but for the sheer joy of creation and sharing with like-minded
  individuals.
</p>
<p>
  The IndieWeb doesn&#39;t need to go mainstream to be meaningful.  It&#39;s a
  celebration of a more personal, decentralised, and creative world
  wide web.  For those of us who still care about these values, it is
  already meaningful.
