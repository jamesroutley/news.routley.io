    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Context:
        </strong>
      
      A child with symptoms placing him within the autism spectrum and with urine biochemical markers consistent with fungal (<i>Aspergillus</i>) colonization of the gastrointestinal tract was first treated with the antifungal probiotic <i>Saccharomyces boulardii.</i> A dramatic Herxheimer reaction provided strong clinical indications that mold colonization might be a factor in causing autism in this child.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Objective:
        </strong>
      
      The child&#39;s physician (Baker) wished to try a more potent antifungal therapy, itraconazole, in an attempt to reverse the child&#39;s autism since itraconazole is an especially effective agent against <i>Aspergillus</i> species.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Setting:
        </strong>
      
      The child was treated as an outpatient by the physician who had first diagnosed the child with an autism spectrum disorder.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Participant:
        </strong>
      
      A child with an autism spectrum disorder.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Intervention:
        </strong>
      
      The major intervention was increasing doses of the antifungal drug itraconazole. However, the Sporanox<sup>®</sup> brand of itraconazole gave the best results. The child was monitored twice weekly with liver function tests which remained normal throughout the therapy.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Results:
        </strong>
      
      The child had a complete recovery from all the symptoms of autism and in addition developed excellent academic, athletic, and musical skills. The recovery coincided with a marked reduction of urine markers of <i>Aspergillus</i> colonization.
    </p>
  

  


              
                


  
    <p>
      
        <strong>
          Conclusions:
        </strong>
      
      Escalation of the dose of itraconazole resulted in a complete loss of all symptoms of autism over the course of three months. This rapid complete reversal of autism is consistent with several articles proposing mold in general and <i>Aspergillus</i> specifically as a potential major cause of autism.
