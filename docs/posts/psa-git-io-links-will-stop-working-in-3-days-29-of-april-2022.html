    <h1>PSA: Git.io links will stop working in 3 days (29 of April 2022)</h1>

<p>Effective Friday, April 29, 2022 all links on git.io will stop redirecting. Please update any existing links that make use of the git.io URL service immediately.</p>
<p><a href="https://git.io/">Git.io</a> is a URL shortening website that GitHub created in <a href="https://github.blog/2011-11-10-git-io-github-url-shortener/">2011</a> for redirecting to GitHub domains like github.com and github.io. What began as an experiment was only lightly documented and was not widely adopted.</p>
<p>In January 2022, we announced that <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2022-01-11-git-io-no-longer-accepts-new-urls/">git.io was becoming read-only</a>. As notified in January, we shared our plans to deprecate the service. Out of an abundance of caution due to the security of the links redirected with the current git.io infrastructure, we have decided to accelerate the timeline. We will be removing all existing link redirection from git.io on April 29, 2022.</p>
<p>Developers should immediately make use of one of the many URL shortening services available with greater functionality than the git.io service provided.</p>
