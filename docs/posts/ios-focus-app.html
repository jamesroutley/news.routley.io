	<p>I’m working on an app to solve a tiny frustration I have with iOS.</p>
<p>iOS’s new-ish “focus” feature lets you create a notification allow- or deny-list while in a “focus” mode. Meanwhile, “Screen Time” lets you block applications entirely, based on daily time limits or a nightly “Downtime” mode.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup></p>
<p>But what I’d like to do is allow-/deny-list entire apps on demand (a la <a href="https://selfcontrolapp.com/">SelfControl</a> — which helped me get through college), all from quick settings. There are a few apps that fill this gap, but they’re all subscription based. Fair enough, get paid, but I don’t need a ton of features and slick UI here.</p>
<p>Most of my iOS experience has been focused on developer productivity and CI — so these are some notes on getting started in app development in 2023.</p>
<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>
<p>I’ve been moving towards managing all of my development tooling with nix, but Xcode can’t be installed via nix (as far as I can tell — I imagine there are licensing issues), and Xcode really wants to manage the entire Swift toolchain. So no nix flakes here.</p>
<p>At a previous job I used <a href="https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple">bazel</a> to build a large iOS codebase, but that feels overkill for a project with single-digit source files. Plus, <code>.pbxproj</code> merge conflicts aren’t too bad when you’re developing solo.</p>
<h4 id="code-formatting">Code formatting</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/apple/swift-format">swift-format</a> is nice. I built it from source and threw it in <code>~/bin</code>.</p>
<p>To format all swift code in a directory (<code>-i</code>n place, <code>-r</code>ecursively):</p>
<pre is:raw="" tabindex="0"><code><span><span>$</span><span> </span><span>swift-format</span><span> </span><span>-i</span><span> </span><span>-r</span><span> </span><span>.</span></span></code></pre>
<h4 id="swiftui">SwiftUI</h4>
<p>I’m watching a few videos from <a href="https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/">a Stanford course</a> to get up to speed on SwiftUI and how it fits into general app architecture.</p>
