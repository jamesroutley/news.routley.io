    <h1>Call for Participation to Chaos Computer Club’s 37C3</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-container">
<h2>The Event</h2>
<p>The Chaos Communication Congress is the Chaos Computer Club’s (CCC) annual symposium and hacker party.</p>
<p>During four days between Christmas and New Year’s Eve, thousands of hackers, technology freaks, artists, and utopians get together in Hamburg to communicate, learn from each other, and party together.</p>
<p>The Congress is the longest running German IT security conference, the biggest European hacker gathering and grew into one of the most important conferences on digital transformation. We focus on topics such as information technology, digital security, making, and breaking. We engage in creative, sceptical discourse on the interaction between technology and society.</p>
<h2>Dates &amp; deadlines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>6 November 2022 (23:59 UTC): Deadline for submissions,</li>
    <li>27 November 2022: Notification of acceptance,</li>
    <li>27 - 30 Dezember 2022: Chaos Communication Congress.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tracks</h2>
<p>37C3 lectures are organized by tracks, each track is curated by a team of experts in the respective field. Please choose one of the tracks below when submitting.</p>

<h2>Art &amp; Beauty</h2>
<p>The quote &#34;you can create art and beauty with a computer&#34; formulated by Steven Levis in 1984 in his hacker ethics is the leitmotif for the Art &amp; Beauty track. The focus here is on artistic practices (including literature, comics, film &amp; audiovisual media, music, games, theater, dance, performance, and painting) that (critically) engage with new technologies and their social impact.</p>
<p>We welcome submissions that use computers, coding, and networks to expand the possibilities of art; or demonstrate that the principles and practices of hacker culture contribute to constructive and unforeseen perspectives in artistic contexts. We also welcome submissions that present a theoretical reflection on the impact of new technologies on artistic practices and forms of expression.</p>

<h2>Ethics, Politics &amp; Society</h2>
<p>The Ethics, Society &amp; Politics track focuses on the societal, ethical and political implications of technology, and on all aspects of digital life. We especially invite talks with regard to:</p>
<ul><li>Technology and Climate Change,</li>
<li>Platform regulation,</li>
<li>Civic disobedience in the digital sphere,</li>
<li>Emerging technologies – let&#39;s shape the unknown!</li></ul>
<p>Activist, phantastic, solidaric, and non-commercial ideas, concepts and stories are very welcome. If you shape society and technology with positive energy, this is the track for you.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>The Hardware track is all about development and creative use of things that allow the digital to make an impression on the physical.</p>
<p>On the one hand our focus is on the whole process from architecture, planning, creation and debugging of everything ranging from textiles, musical instruments, robots, integrated circuits, means of transporting for people and mate, launching stuff into space, alternative energy supplies to medical tools - all things hands-on.</p>
<p>On the other hand we must balance building new hardware with sustaining a liveable planet. So please tell us your stories about the expansion, repair and regaining sovereign use of technology, and as always we like to hear about liberation of proprietary systems - from decapped smart-card to the firmware of your toaster to a modified agricultural machine.</p>
<p>Of course we&#39;re also up for a surprise: Hit us with all the things we can&#39;t imagine - and of course rockets!</p>

<h2>Science</h2>
<p>The multiple and interwoven crises of the present dominate public attention. Unfortunately, they often leave little room for a (self-)critical look at the very details that are essential for good solutions. The sciences offer a multitude of approaches, ideas and theories that can help us all cope with the crises and that will be with us in the future. Numerous, fascinating developments combine science and technology. Artificial intelligences are processing medical data or deliver entirely new protein structures. Quantum computing is getting closer to practical use with each passing year. Social sciences offer insights into how we live together in a changing world. The science track offers time and space for all of these scientific topics - and far beyond. Whether you&#39;re working at research centers, universities, or in the garage: If you explore and evaluate interesting and important developments from a scientific point of view, share your knowledge and submit a relevant presentation topic!</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>For this track, we are looking for content demonstrating the influence of security aspects on users, machines and society. We would therefore like to request technical submissions focusing on security problems and solutions in both, hardware and software.</p>

<p>If you want to share your discoveries with thousands of fellow security enthusiasts, if you have developed new solutions to previously unsolved problems, or if you have found uncommon problems which we knew nothing about, then this is the right track for you.</p>

<p>This year, we are looking for content that focuses on IT security and resilience in times of global uncertainty. The pandemic changed the way people live and work: collaborative working from home office, using insecure endpoints via the cloud became possible and enables remote access to central infrastructure. In the course of the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine, economy and society also became aware of how vulnerable both, this beautiful new technology but also our old critical infrastructure, is. We are looking forward to submissions that address those challenges and complex attack surfaces, but also take on the special care and responsibility that dealing with computers and the Internet requires.</p>

<p>This includes topics from mathematics, networks, operating systems, web technologies, memory (mis)management, cryptography, programming languages, hardware design and other fields.</p>

<h2>The pandemic</h2>
<p>We know as much as you do regarding what the possible legal restrictions on events could mean for the Congress, but will <a href="https://events.ccc.de/">keep you informed on our events blog</a>.</p>
<p>Our organization teams are working on a pandemic safety concept, which will be published here before the submission deadline.</p>
<p>Please state in your submission, if you would only participate in a face-to-face event.</p>

<h2>Online submissions only</h2>
<p>Please submit your talk to our conference planning system at <a href="https://frab.cccv.de/en/37c3/cfp">https://frab.cccv.de/en/37c3/cfp</a>. Lectures are 40 or 60 minutes by default.</p>
<p>Simply follow the instructions there. If you plan to submit anything other than a lecture, want to present longer than 60 minutes, or just have any questions regarding the submission, you are welcome to contact us via mail at 37c3-content(at)cccv.de.</p>
<h2>Submission guidelines</h2>
<p>Please send us a description of your suggested talk that is as complete as possible. The description is the main criterium for acceptance or rejection, so please ensure that it is as clear and complete as possible. Quality comes before quantity. Due to the non-commercial nature of the event, presentations which aim to market or promote commercial products or entities will be rejected without consideration.</p>
<p>Since most participants find (or don’t find) a lecture by its title, it’s important to keep it precise, accessible and comprehensible. Our teams will keep a keen eye on title and subtitle and make suggestions to change them if necessary, so please avoid insider jokes and stereotypes. It would be a shame if we would have to reject an otherwise excellent submission because the title does not tell much about the actual content.</p>
<p>As it is likely that there will be multiple submissions on the same topic, please show us exactly why your talk should be part of the conference. Remember that the teams are diversely staffed, and not every reviewer knows every submitter and their background. Please write something about yourself, your research, and your motivation. It does not matter if the talk has been held at another conference somewhere on this planet, as long as it is up to date and relevant.</p>
<p>Talks should be either 30 minutes long plus 10 minutes for questions and answers or 45 minutes long plus 15 minutes for questions and answers. Longer slots are possible if absolutely necessary, but should be an exception. Please take our limited amount of presentation time into consideration, check how much time you really need to bring home your points and then tell us the proposed length of your talk.</p>
<h2>Travel, costs &amp; visa</h2>
<p>The Chaos Communication Congress is a non-commercial event where neither the organisers nor the speakers are being paid. As an accepted speaker for a full talk, you get free admission, though. If necessary, we are able to provide limited support for travel costs. If you need help applying for a visa, such as an official invitation to present to the German embassy, please make sure to let the content team know well in advance. Please be aware that the visa application procedure may take up to six weeks.</p>
