    <h1>Element (Matrix) adds video/voice rooms</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today’s update sees <strong>Video Rooms entering beta</strong> in Element, and <strong>a new search experience </strong>exiting beta! You can’t say we don’t spoil you 😉!</p><h2 id="video-rooms"><strong>Video Rooms</strong></h2><p>We’ve all been in situations where arranging a video call is way too formal. The hassle of messaging multiple people, seeing who is around, solving calendar puzzles to find a time which works for everyone...<br/></p><p>This has been a long time coming and, frankly, we’re really excited to be introducing <strong>Video Rooms </strong>to you. It’s a major step towards richer video (and soon voice) rooms!<br/></p><p>Here’s some ways to use it:<br/></p><p>✅ A new way to hang out with groups of people for more casual chats in your communities</p><p>✅ More water cooler discussions at work</p><p>✅ A fun way to hang out with friends</p><h2 id="starting-a-video-room">Starting a Video Room</h2><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2022/07/Start-Video-Room-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Start-Video-Room-2.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/Start-Video-Room-2.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2022/07/Start-Video-Room-2.png 1440w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>How to create a new Video Room</figcaption></figure><p>To enable Video Rooms, please go to labs which you can find in settings. While we’re in beta, <strong>starting</strong> a Video Room is limited to Element Web &amp; Desktop. You can create one the same way you create a Room and likewise they can be named, used and shared however you like! But please be aware that anyone can broadcast in a Video Room, so we recommend only inviting people you trust.<br/></p><h2 id="joining-a-video-room">Joining a Video Room</h2><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2022/07/Video-Room-With-Chat-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/Video-Room-With-Chat-3.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/Video-Room-With-Chat-3.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2022/07/Video-Room-With-Chat-3.png 1410w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>What it looks like in action!</figcaption></figure><p>Video Rooms appear and behave like a normal room in the room list until you join.<br/></p><p>On Element Web &amp; Desktop, once you join a Video Room they provide a full-screen video experience with a chat timeline on the side, stick to the top of your room list, and use Picture in Picture to keep you connected while you browse the rest of your chats.<br/></p><p>On Element iOS &amp; Android, while we’re in beta Video Rooms behave the same as an ongoing group call.</p><h2 id="what-s-next"><strong>What’s next?</strong><br/></h2><p>We’ve built Video Rooms backed by Jitsi (the same technology used by group calls in Element today) so we can learn more about using them sooner. Once <a href="https://element.io/blog/element-call-beta-2-encryption-spatial-audio-walkie-talkie-mode-and-more/">Element Call</a> is out of beta, we’ll pivot Video Rooms to use that instead for a more native user experience, end-to-end encryption, voice only rooms and to <em>finally</em> unlock features like <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/5993">push to talk</a>.<br/></p><p>Until then - we’d love your feedback after taking Video Rooms for a spin.</p><hr/><h2 id="that-s-not-all-new-search-is-out-of-beta-on-web-and-desktop-"><strong>That’s not all - new Search is out of beta on web and desktop!</strong><br/></h2><p>We&#39;ve been working on our new full-screen room search feature since December, and we&#39;re excited to say that it&#39;s finally ready for action!  <br/></p><p>This is a major step forwards in terms of providing quick and easy access to all the conversations and Spaces that you&#39;re in, with a beautiful snappy UI to help you find what you&#39;re looking for.  <br/></p><p>Huge thanks to everyone who&#39;s beta-tested it over the last 6 months!</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2022/07/ezgif-3-eed13a75b1.gif" alt=""/></figure><p>We’re excited about the update because:<br/></p><p>🔎 It makes search really quick and easy! To open the new search interface, you can either use the Ctrl+K shortcut or just click on the search box in the left panel.<br/></p><p>🔎 You also have quick access to your recently viewed rooms classic breadcrumbs and, for the first time, recent searches; giving you a shortcut to your previous search results.<br/></p><p>🔎 Don’t worry if you can’t see what you’re looking for - just type your word into the search to find it in your DMs, Rooms and Spaces. And it will even show you other suggested rooms in your Spaces!</p><h2 id="introducing-filters">Introducing filters<br/></h2><p>What if you want to find a Room you haven’t joined yet, or start a conversation with someone new? We’ve got you covered!</p><p>If you know that you’re looking for a new public room or person, you can now click on the “Public Rooms” or “People” filters to show only those results.</p><p>Advanced users will still be able to add other homeservers and search for rooms by selecting “public rooms” and then using the drop-down list...</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2022/07/search-with-filters@2x.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/07/search-with-filters@2x.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/07/search-with-filters@2x.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/07/search-with-filters@2x.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/07/search-with-filters@2x.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/><figcaption>Search made easier!</figcaption></figure><h2 id="what-does-the-future-hold">What does the future hold?<br/></h2><p>Adding a dedicated search dialog and filters has opened up endless possibilities for new search functionality.</p><p>We have lots in the pipeline! We’ll flag when these and other new features go live, so you don’t have to &#39;search&#39; them out… 😉<br/></p></div></div>
