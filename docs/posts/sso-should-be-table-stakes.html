    <h1>SSO should be table stakes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>On its face, SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) is the perfect feature to push your bigger customers into your
enterprise tier.</p>

<p>Your small customers won’t care about it, but your bigger ones are often required to use it by their security
departments.</p>

<p>If you’re a new SaaS founder and you want to maximize your revenue, I recommend you create an enterprise tier, put SSO
in it, and charge 2-5x your normal pricing. Even with no other benefits, some customers will be forced to choose this option.</p>

<p>People will get a little mad at you, but not much, because <a href="https://sso.tax/">just about everyone does this</a>.</p>

<p>(Another reason this move is so popular is because offering SSO costs close to nothing after a little automation, so
this price increase is all profit.)</p>

<p>When we were baby bootstrappers, we did exactly this. We put SSO in our enterprise tier, charged ~2x for it, and made a
bunch of money.</p>

<p>The thing was, we always felt kind of gross about it.</p>

<p>SSO support is a critical security feature. As the experts at Latacora <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2020/03/12/the-soc-starting.html">say</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You need an inventory of your applications, a single place to disable access for users, and a way to force 2FA in as
many places as possible. The alternative is madness. Every CSO we’ve asked has SSO in their top 5 ‘first things they’d
do at a new company.’</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Withholding SSO from our customers made their organizations demonstrably less secure. We could have flipped a switch and
fixed this at ~no cost to ourselves, but instead we charged a huge premium for it. This always felt a little gray hat to
me. Not quite “I’ve encrypted your data and demand you send me Bitcoin,” but not something I’d be proud to bring up at
Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>Back then, we were trying to make sure our company survived, and every dollar mattered to us (particularly because
we’re self-funded). We held our noses and did the thing because it was highly profitable and everyone else was
doing it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, our business is now profitable enough that we can stop making this crummy tradeoff.</p>

<p><strong>As of today, we’re adding SSO to every Tuple plan at no additional charge.</strong></p>

<p>In the short-term, this decision will almost certainly cost us money.</p>

<p>In the long-term, we hope to attract customers who appreciate our prioritization of security over chasing every dollar.</p>

<p>Already, this decision has had a pleasant side-effect – it’s forced us to offer <a href="https://tuple.app/enterprise">better benefits</a> to entice customers into our enterprise tier: service level agreements, active user pricing, custom terms of service, tiered discounts,
and better auditing and control. We’ve still got work to do here, but I’m excited to sign up customers who are
attracted to these features, rather than repulsed by the idea of less secure user accounts.</p>

<p>If you’re a Tuple customer, you can find instructions for enabling SSO for your team <a href="https://tuple.app/sso_setup?utm_source=blog&amp;utm_campaign=sso-goes-free">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re not a customer, please consider <a href="https://production.tuple.app/signups/new?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=sso-goes-free">becoming one</a> to help replace those sweet enterprise dollars we likely just
incinerated.</p>
