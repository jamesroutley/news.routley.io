<p>Last April, Meta <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/04/red-table-talk-canceled-mina-lefevre-exits-facebook-watch-ends-originals-meta-1235337005/">revealed</a> that it would no longer support original shows, like Jada Pinkett Smith&#39;s <em>Red Table Talk</em> talk show, on Facebook Watch. Meta&#39;s streaming business that was once viewed as competition for the likes of YouTube and Netflix is effectively dead now; Facebook doesn&#39;t produce original series, and Facebook Watch is no longer available as a video-streaming app.</p>
<p>The streaming business&#39; demise has seemed related to cost cuts at Meta that have also included layoffs. However, recently unsealed court documents in an antitrust suit against Meta [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Klein-v.-Meta-Platforms.pdf">PDF</a>] claim that Meta has squashed its streaming dreams in order to appease one of its biggest ad customers: Netflix.</p>
<h2>Facebook allegedly gave Netflix creepy privileges</h2>
<p>As spotted via <a href="https://gizmodo.com/facebooks-streaming-watch-killed-sell-netflix-ads-1851367876?utm_source=vip">Gizmodo</a>, a letter was filed on April 14 in relation to a class-action antitrust suit that was filed by Meta customers, accusing Meta of anti-competitive practices that harm social media competition and consumers. The letter, made public Saturday, asks a court to have Reed Hastings, Netflix&#39;s founder and former CEO, respond to a subpoena for documents that plaintiffs claim are relevant to the case. The original complaint filed in December 2020 [<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/complaint.pdf">PDF</a>] doesn’t mention Netflix beyond stating that Facebook “secretly signed Whitelist and Data sharing agreements” with Netflix, along with “dozens” of other third-party app developers. The case is still ongoing.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The letter alleges that Netflix&#39;s relationship with Facebook was remarkably strong due to the former&#39;s ad spend with the latter and that Hastings directed &#34;negotiations to end competition in streaming video&#34; from Facebook.</p>
<p>One of the first questions that may come to mind is why a company like Facebook would allow Netflix to influence such a major business decision. The litigation claims the companies formed a lucrative business relationship that included Facebook allegedly giving Netflix access to Facebook users&#39; private messages:</p>
<blockquote><p>By 2013, Netflix had begun entering into a series of “Facebook Extended API” agreements, including a so-called “Inbox API” agreement that allowed Netflix programmatic access to Facebook’s users&#39; private message inboxes, in exchange for which Netflix would “provide to FB a written report every two weeks that shows daily counts of recommendation sends and recipient clicks by interface, initiation surface, and/or implementation variant (e.g., Facebook vs. non-Facebook recommendation recipients). ... In August 2013, Facebook provided Netflix with access to its so-called “Titan API,” a private API that allowed a whitelisted partner to access, among other things, Facebook users&#39; “messaging app and non-app friends.&#34;</p></blockquote>
<p>Meta <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/12/default-end-to-end-encryption-on-messenger/#:~:text=This%20means%20that%20nobody%2C%20including,more%20secure%20chats%20in%20Messenger.">said</a> it rolled out end-to-end encryption &#34;for all personal chats and calls on Messenger and Facebook&#34; in December. And in 2018, Facebook <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/11/17177842/facebook-advertising-ads-explained-mark-zuckerberg">told Vox</a> that it doesn&#39;t use private messages for ad targeting. But a few months later, The New York Times, citing &#34;hundreds of pages of Facebook documents,&#34; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/12/report-facebook-let-companies-get-even-more-data-than-previously-known/">reported that</a> Facebook &#34;gave Netflix and Spotify the ability to read Facebook users’ private messages.&#34;</p>
<p>Meta didn&#39;t respond to Ars Technica&#39;s request for comment. The company told Gizmodo that it has standard agreements with Netflix currently but didn&#39;t answer the publication&#39;s specific questions.</p>
