						<h2>What is it?</h2>
						<p>kv4p HT is a homebrew VHF radio that makes your phone capable of voice and text communication completely off-grid with at least a Technician class amateur radio license.</p> 
						<p>The radio simply plugs into the USB C port on your Android smartphone and transforms it into a fully-fledged handheld radio transceiver.
						It&#39;s completely open source (<a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html#license-text" target="_new">GPL3</a>): the Android app, ESP32 firmware, PCB designs, and 3D printer files.</p>
						<p>It&#39;s small enough to fit in your pocket and take anywhere, and since it has no internal battery
						it&#39;s the perfect radio to put in a go-bag or your car&#39;s glove compartment.</p>
						<p><b>NOTE:</b> kv4p HT is an open source project you build yourself and has absolutely no warranty, or guarantees on functionality or reliability! That said, have fun. :)</p>
