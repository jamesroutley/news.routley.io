     <div><div><p>I always liked <a href="https://3.14.by/en/read/toshiba-libretto-50ct">small laptops</a> and phones - but for some reason they fell out of favor of manufacturers (&#34;bigger is more better&#34;). Now if one wanted to get tiny laptop - one of the few opportunities would have been to fight for old Sony UMPC&#39;s on ebay which are somewhat expensive even today. Recently Raspberry Pi/CM4-based tiny laptops started to appear - especially <a href="https://www.clockworkpi.com/home-devterm">clockwork</a> products are neat, but they are not foldable like a laptop. When in summer of 2023 Sipeed announced <a href="https://sipeed.com/licheepi4a">Lichee Console 4A</a> based on RISC-V SoC - I preordered it immediately and in early January I finally received it. Results of my testing, currently uncovered issues are below.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
