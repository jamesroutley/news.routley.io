    <h1>Frankfurt rail work damaged fibre, causes global Lufthansa check-in system fault</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Lufthansa spokesperson reported on Wednesday a company-wide system fault, with massive delays and disruptions in flights at Frankfurt Airport resulting from the failure.</p>

<p><a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/en/german-government-opposes-lufthansa-executive-bonuses/a-64178439">Lufthansa</a> said construction work on a rail line in Frankfurt was to blame for the massive IT failure. Currently, the breakdown is presumed to have been caused by a cable getting slit during rail construction work on the Frankfurt S-Bahn. Deutsche Bahn stated it immediately informed Telekom about the damage and apologized to affected travelers for the inconvenience caused. </p>

<p>Lufthansa cited a statement by Telekom saying that the complete fixing of the cable disruptions would likely take until Wednesday afternoon. </p>

<h2>IT meltdown causes Frankfurt Airport mayhem</h2>

<p>Frankfurt Airport operator Fraport said flights were allowed to now land after a day of chaos. Lufthansa said IT systems were rebooting and that &#34;there are departures from Frankfurt again.&#34;</p>

<p>All of Lufthansa&#39;s departures from Frankfurt Airport were earlier stopped, as systems for check-in and boarding were interrupted. Hundreds of flights were cancelled. </p>

<p>German air traffic control was temporarily re-routing all aircrafts landing in Frankfurt Airport to other destinations such as Cologne, Düsseldorf and Nürnberg because of the breakdown. The measure was intended to prevent the hub from filling up, an air traffic control spokesperson confirmed. </p>

<p>Take-offs, on the other hand, were still possible in Frankfurt. Lufthansa&#39;s second-biggest hub, Munich, was not restricted by air traffic control at this point in time. If problems persisted, this could become an option, a spokesperson of air traffic control said. </p><figure><img data-format="MASTER_LANDSCAPE" data-id="64711068" data-url="https://static.dw.com/image/64711068_${formatId}.jpg" alt="Passengers stand in line at Lufthansa check-in counters amid IT chaos at Frankfurt Airport"/><figcaption>The system failure disrupted travel planes, leaving international passengers stranded in Frankfurt<small>Image: Arne Dedert/dpa/picture alliance</small></figcaption></figure>

<p>International flights were also affected by the failure, leading to many passengers potentially missing their connecting flights. </p>

<h2>Other German airports seemingly unaffected</h2>

<p>Passengers and aircraft staff alike were stranded at <a href="https://payments.posthaven.com/en/frankfurt-airport-cancels-flights-as-security-staff-strike/a-61132149">Frankfurt Airport</a>. A spokesperson in Frankfurt said that the company was intensively working on a solution. Other airports in Germany seemed to be less affected. </p>

<p>Reuters reported that Lufthansa&#39;s shares were down by 1.2% following the system fault.</p><div><h2 aria-label="Embedded video — Lufthansa struggles to man its flights"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20"><g fill-rule="evenodd"><path d="M14.114 7.599H13.5l.002 4.706h.601l4.582 3.25-.005-11.11zM11.084 4.444l-9.007.002-1.336.797.002 9.514 1.334.793 9.007.006 1.509-.799-.004-9.516z"></path></g></svg>Lufthansa struggles to man its flights</h2><video id="video-64665800" controls="" playsinline="" preload="none" poster="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-id="64665800" data-posterurl="https://static.dw.com/image/46698353_605.jpg" data-duration="02:46"><source src="https://hlsvod.dw.com/i/vps/webvideos/ENG/2023/BUSI/BUSIENG230210_QWIPERSONALWEB_01SM_,AVC_512x288,AVC_960x540,AVC_1280x720,AVC_1920x1080,.mp4.csmil/master.m3u8" type="application/x-mpegURL"/><source src="https://tvdownloaddw-a.akamaihd.net/vps/webvideos/ENG/2023/BUSI/BUSIENG230210_QWIPERSONALWEB_01SM_AVC_1920x1080.mp4" type="video/mp4"/><p>To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that <a href="https://videojs.com/html5-video-support/" target="_blank">supports HTML5 video</a></p></video></div>
