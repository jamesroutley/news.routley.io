					Bytebeat music (or one-liner music) was invented in September 2011.
					They&#39;re generally a piece of rhythmic and somewhat melodic music with no score, no instruments, and no real oscillators.
					It&#39;s simply a single-line formula that defines a waveform as a function of time, processed (usually) 8000 times per second, resulting in an audible waveform with a 256-step resolution from silence (0) to full amplitude (256).
					If you put that formula into a program with a loop that increments time variable (t), you can generate the headerless unsigned 8 bit mono 8kHz audio stream on output, like in this application.
					Since these directly output a waveform, they have great performance in compiled languages and can often be ran on even the weakest embedded devices.</article>
