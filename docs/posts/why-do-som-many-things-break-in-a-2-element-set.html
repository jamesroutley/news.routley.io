    <h1>Why do som many things break in a 2 element set?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>The math jargon for a set where you can implement a 4 function calculator
\((+,-,*,/)\) is a <em>field</em>. Fields can have a finite number of elements, and
such fields always have a prime power number of elements, aka \(p^k\) where \(p\) is prime and \(k\) is a natural number.</p>

<p>Many results are not true if the underlying field has exactly 2 elements. The
reason why:</p>

<p>\(x = -x\) \(x + x = -x + x\) \(2x = 0\)</p>

<p>The final formula is taken to mean that \(x\) is zero. But there’s another interpretation.</p>

<p>What if 2 = 0?</p>

<p>In a field with 2 elements, this is true. Moreover, \(x = -x\) is a tautology AKA always true AKA worthless. \(-1 \mod 2 = 1\) and \(0 \mod 2 = 0\).</p>

<p>This is <em>only</em> when the underlying field has 2 elements. A 2 element set is exceptional because negation doesn’t actually do anything.</p>
