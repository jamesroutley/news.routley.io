<p>Enbridge, a Canadian energy company, just announced it’s moving forward with an 815-megawatt (MW) solar project called Sequoia in Texas. When it’s done, it’ll be one of the largest solar farms in North America. The project’s price tag is a hefty $1.1 billion.</p>



<p>Enbridge’s Sequoia, around 150 miles west of Dallas, has already landed long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with AT&amp;T and <a href="https://electrek.co/guides/toyota/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toyota</a>, ensuring most of its output is sold for years to come. This deal was highlighted in Enbridge’s <a href="https://www.enbridge.com/media-center/news/details?id=123833&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third-quarter report</a> on Friday.</p>



<p>Sequoia will be built in two phases, with power expected to start flowing in 2025 and 2026. Enbridge says it’s taken steps to reduce risks by securing equipment and procurement contracts in advance. Permits and purchase orders are also locked down.</p>



<p>Toyota’s PPA with Enbridge’s Texas solar project is part of Toyota’s broader push toward sustainability, as the automaker aims to achieve net zero by 2035 and match 45% of its purchased power with renewable electricity by 2026 as it still clings to its “diverse powertrain strategy.”</p>
