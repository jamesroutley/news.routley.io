We’ve invested a lot of time and resources building moderation tools and other infrastructure to protect the youngest members of our community. We’re also aware of the tradeoffs that come with managing an online platform. Our mission is to build an open and decentralized protocol for public conversation, and we believe in empowering users with more choices and control over their experience. We work with regulators around the world on child safety—for example, Bluesky follows the UK&#39;s Online Safety Act, where age checks are required only for specific content and features.</p>
<p>Mississippi&#39;s approach would fundamentally change how users access Bluesky. The Supreme Court’s recent <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/25a97_5h25.pdf">decision</a> leaves us facing a hard reality: comply with Mississippi’s age assurance <a href="https://legiscan.com/MS/text/HB1126/id/2988284">law</a>—and make <em>every</em> Mississippi Bluesky user hand over sensitive personal information and undergo age checks to access the site—or risk massive fines. The law would also require us to identify and track which users are children, unlike our approach in other regions. We think this law creates challenges that go beyond its child safety goals, and creates significant barriers that limit free speech and disproportionately harm smaller platforms and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Unlike tech giants with vast resources, we’re a small team focused on building decentralized social technology that puts users in control. Age verification systems require substantial infrastructure and developer time investments, complex privacy protections, and ongoing compliance monitoring — costs that can easily overwhelm smaller providers. This dynamic entrenches existing big tech platforms while stifling the innovation and competition that benefits users.</p>
<p>We believe effective child safety policies should be carefully tailored to address real harms, without creating huge obstacles for smaller providers and resulting in negative consequences for free expression. That’s why until legal challenges to this law are resolved, we’ve made the difficult decision to block access from Mississippi IP addresses. We know this is disappointing for our users in Mississippi, but we believe this is a necessary measure while the courts review the legal arguments.</p>
<p>Here’s more on our decision and what comes next.</p>
<h2>Why We’re Doing This</h2>
<p>Mississippi’s <a href="https://legiscan.com/MS/text/HB1126/id/2988284">HB1126</a> requires platforms to implement age verification for all users before they can access services like Bluesky. That means, under the law, we would need to verify every user’s age and obtain parental consent for anyone under 18. The potential penalties for non-compliance are substantial — up to $10,000 per user. Building the required verification systems, parental consent workflows, and compliance infrastructure would require significant resources that our small team is currently unable to spare as we invest in developing safety tools and features for our global community, particularly given the law&#39;s broad scope and privacy implications.</p>
<h2>Our Concerns About Mississippi’s Approach</h2>
<p>While we share the goal of protecting young people online, we have concerns about this law’s implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broad scope: The law requires age verification for all users, not just those accessing age-restricted content, which affects the ability of everyone in Mississippi to use Bluesky.</li>
<li>Barriers to innovation: The compliance requirements disadvantage newer and smaller platforms like Bluesky, which do not have the luxury of big teams to build the necessary tooling. The law makes it harder for people to engage in free expression and chills the opportunity to communicate in new ways.</li>
<li>Privacy implications: The law requires collecting and storing sensitive personal information from all users, including detailed tracking of minors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What We’re Doing</h2>
<p>Starting today, if you access Bluesky from a Mississippi IP address, you’ll see a message explaining why the app isn’t available. This block will remain in place while the courts decide whether the law will stand.</p>
<h2>How This Differs From Our Approach in Other Places</h2>
<p>Mississippi’s new law and the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA) are very different. Bluesky <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/07-10-2025-age-assurance">follows</a> the OSA in the UK. There, Bluesky is still accessible for everyone, age checks are required only for accessing certain content and features, and Bluesky does not know and does not track which UK users are under 18. Mississippi’s law, by contrast, would block everyone from accessing the site—teens and adults—unless they hand over sensitive information, and once they do, the law in Mississippi requires Bluesky to keep track of which users are children.</p>
<h2>Other Apps on the Protocol</h2>
<p>This decision applies only to the Bluesky app, which is one service built on the AT Protocol. Other apps and services may choose to respond differently. We believe this flexibility is one of the strengths of decentralized systems—different providers can make decisions that align with their values and capabilities, especially during periods of regulatory uncertainty. We remain committed to building a protocol that enables openness and choice.</p>
<h2>What’s Next</h2>
<p>We do not take this decision lightly. Child safety is a core priority, and in this evolving regulatory landscape, we remain committed to building an open social ecosystem that protects users while preserving choice and innovation. We’ll keep you updated as this situation develops.</p></div></section></section></div></div></div>
