	A few years ago, I lived in Santa Monica, California, right on the beach.
</p><p>
	There’s a great bike path that goes along the ocean for seven and a half miles.
	So, fifteen miles round trip.
	On weekday afternoons, it’s almost empty.
	It’s perfect for going full speed.
</p><p>
	So a few times a week, I’d get on <a href="https://surlybikes.com/bikes/straggler">my bike</a> and go as fast as I could for the fifteen-mile loop.
	I mean really full-on, 100 percent, head-down, red-faced sprinting.
</p><p>
	I’d finish exhausted and look at the time:
<strong>
	forty-three minutes.
</strong>
	Every time.
	Maybe a minute more on a really windy day, but basically always forty-three minutes.
</p><p>
	After a few months, I noticed I was getting less enthusiastic about this bike ride.
	I think I had mentally linked it with being completely exhausted.
</p><p>
	So one day I decided <strong>I would do the same ride, but just chill</strong>.
	Take it easy, nice and slow.
	OK, not <em>super</em> slow, but dialing it back to about 50 percent of my usual effort.
</p><p>
	And ahhh… what a nice ride.
	I was relaxed and smiling and looking around.
	I was barely giving it any effort.
</p><p>
	I saw two dolphins in the water.
	A pelican flew right over me in Marina del Rey.
	When I looked up to say “wow!” he shit in my mouth.
	I can still remember that taste of digested shellfish.
	I had to laugh at the novelty of it.
</p><p>
	I’m usually so damn driven, always doing everything as intensely as I can.
	It was so nice to take it easy for once.
	I felt I could do this forever, without any exhaustion.
</p><p>
	When I finished, I looked at the time: <strong>forty-five minutes.</strong>
</p><p>
	Wait — what?!?
	How could that be?
	Yep.
	I double-checked: forty-five minutes, as compared to my usual forty-three.
</p><p>
	So apparently all of that exhausting, red-faced, full-on push-push-push I had been doing had given me only a <strong>4 percent</strong> boost.
	I could just take it easy and get <strong>96 percent of the results</strong>.
</p><p>
	And what a difference in experience!
	To go the <em>same</em> distance, in about the <em>same</em> time, but one way leaves me exhausted, and the other way, rejuvenated.
</p><p>
	I think of this often.
	When I notice that I’m all stressed out about something or driving myself to exhaustion, I remember that bike ride and try dialing back my effort by 50 percent.
	It’s been amazing how often everything gets done just as well and just as fast, with what <em>feels</em> like half the effort.
</p><p>
	Which then makes me realize that half of my effort wasn’t effort at all, but just unnecessary stress that made me <em>feel</em> like I was doing my best.
