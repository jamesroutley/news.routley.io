<td>Electric Circuit Analysis deals with the fundamentals of electrical circuits, their components and the mathematical tools used to represent and analyse electrical circuits. By the end of the course, the student will be able to confidently analyse and build simple electrical circuits. Parts of this course include: Circuit Variables, Circuit Elements, Simple Resistive Circuits, Techniques of Circuit Analysis, Kirchhoff&#39;s Voltage Law problems, Kirchhoff&#39;s Current Law problems, Nodal Analysis problems, Mesh Analysis problems. The course comprises a total of about 25 pages with a high layout design quality. Course creators from other disciplines can use this course for ideas about organisation, layout and design of wiki courses. The course itself is suitable for non-specialists from secondary education upwards.
