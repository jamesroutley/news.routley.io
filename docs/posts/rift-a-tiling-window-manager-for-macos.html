    <h1>Show HN: Rift â€“ A tiling window manager for macOS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><div dir="auto">

  <p dir="auto">Rift is a tiling window manager for macOS that focuses on performance and usability. </p>

<p dir="auto">Rift is in active development but is still generally stable. There is no official release yet; expect ongoing changes.</p>

<p dir="auto">Issues and PRs are very welcome.</p>

<p dir="auto">Aerospace worked well for me, but I missed animations and the ability to use fullscreen on one display while working on the other. I also prefer leveraging private/undocumented APIs as they tend to be more reliable (due to the OS being built on them and all the public APIs) and performant.
<sup><sup>for more on why rift exists and what rift strives to do, see the <a href="https://github.com/acsandmann/rift/blob/main/manifesto.md">manifesto</a></sup></sup></p>

<p dir="auto">Rift began as a fork (and is licensed as such) of <a href="https://github.com/glide-wm/glide">glide-wm</a> but has since diverged significantly. It uses private APIs reverse engineered by yabai and other projects. It is not affiliated with glide-wm or yabai.</p>
