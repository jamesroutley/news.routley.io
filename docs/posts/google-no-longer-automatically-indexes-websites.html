    <h1>Google no longer automatically indexes websites?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

				<p><span>Can you please take a few minutes today, go to Google, and search for your website using the site search filter? (EX: site:mysite.com) Do you have about the right number of pages showing up, or just a few pages, or worse yet – none?</span></p>
<p><span>The reason I am asking you to do this is that I’ve noticed recently that Google no longer automatically indexes websites, and thus is not sending traffic to those sites.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are a few examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>A couple months a new client came to me and asked me why her 4-month-old website wasn’t showing up in Google. It was in Bing and DuckDuckGo, but not Google. (I fixed this, but I neve did find the cause.)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>Yesterday I helped out someone on Reddit who could not figure out why his two-month-old website had not been indexed by Google. (I told him to submit a sitemap in </span><a href="https://search.google.com/search-console/about"><span>Search Console</span></a><span>, and see if that helped.)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>This morning I discovered that a site where I am the volunteer webmaster had not been indexed by Google. The site is a year old, perfectly functional, and I had already submitted a sitemap in Search Console, and yet even though Google has a sitemap showing 9 pages, Google had only indexed the home page. (DDG had indexed the entire site.)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Folks, I have been a web designer since 2016, and before that I was a blogger for 6 plus years. I have been deeply interested in Google SEO since 2010, and in all that time I’ve never heard of Google not indexing a site. Oh, sure, sometimes the website owner sets a noindex tag (accidents happen) but I have never heard of Google failing to index a site for no reason.</span></p>
<p><span>Google used to just index every site whether you wanted them to or not. That’s why the </span><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/block-indexing"><span>noindex</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/att_a_rel.asp"><span>nofollow</span></a><span> tags even exist, to give website owners more control over what Google did on their site.</span></p>
<p><span>This is so unheard of that I honestly didn’t use to bother to check whether a site shows up in Google unless I was asked to do so. I’ve literally never needed to do that when working on SEO (it would be like making sure gravity still works). in fact, <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide?visit_id=638210478876261619-1340147501&amp;rd=1">Google’s own help pages</a> say that you can pretty much assume that Google will index your site.</span></p>
<p><span>So if you have time today, you really should make sure that your site is showing up in Google. If Google neglected to index your site, you’re missing out on traffic.</span></p>
<p><strong>So how do you fix this?</strong></p>
<p>TBH, I am not sure. I would have thought that submitting a sitemap would fix this issue, but that didn’t help with the convention website. So what I am currently trying as a solution is using the “URL Inspection” feature in Search Console to force Google to index each page. It’s time and labor intensive, but I don’t have another option.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: The URL Inspection feature does work to get pages added to Google search results, and that is a relief. Alas, Google is only indexing the specific page I put into URL Inspection, which means I still have to solve this one page at a time. That is going to suck for anyone who has this problem with a huge site containing hundreds of pages.</p>
