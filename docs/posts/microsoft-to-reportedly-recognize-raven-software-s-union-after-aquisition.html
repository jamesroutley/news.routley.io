				<p> Microsoft will recognize Game Workers United, the union formed from QA staffers from Raven Software, when the tech giant acquired Activision Blizzard later next year. In a roundtable, Xbox boss Phil Spencer told the Xbox Game Studios staff that he supported unions and will work with Game Workers United. </p>
<p> THEYGAMER DAY PARTY – GET YOUR LIFE! </p>
<p> “We understand the right of employees to form unions”, said Spencer during the annual meeting at the all. In an interview with the former CEO, Spencer admitted that he’d never really dealt with a unionized workforce before, but both he and the Xbox general counsel had been “spending a lot of time to educate people on unions.” </p>
<p> Rapport: The Game Industry’s Relationships to Alcohol are related: Report: The Game Industry is very close to play. </p>
<p> “Until the deal is close,” says Spencer. Microsoft has proposed the acquisition of Activision Blizzard – the largest in videogame history – worth 70m$. The acquisition will run from November 23 to October. “We think that employee rights are something that can be formed in relation to company workers.” </p>
<p> The call of duty maker Raven Software recently resigned after months of battle with Activision management. That fight began last winter after an outsister were fired, leading those who remained to strike in protest. That strike finally led to an unofficial union vote against Activision Blizzard, which was refused to recognize, and thus organised the effort to advance the national labor union decision. With that vote ended, the vast majority of Ravens QA staff supported unionization. </p>
<p> Activision Blizzard avoided an extra expense to keep the company’s efforts at Raven’s organization, hiring a union-busting law firm and spreading the QA staff through multiple departments, enabling them to communicate. Activision Blizzard, according to the Labor Relations Board, illegally threatened employees after discussing their work conditions with their coworkers and implemented social media rules that violated workers’ rights. </p>
<p> Though the NLRB acknowledged the original record, Activision Blizzard’s recent statement shows that the publisher’s relationship with Game Workers United will be disputed. </p>
