    <h1>Show HN: Polytomic Connect – API for two-way ETL and data syncs with customers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello HN, we’re Ghalib and Nathan from Polytomic. Today we’re launching our second product, Polytomic Connect: <a href="https://www.polytomic.com/connect">https://www.polytomic.com/connect</a> (documentation here: <a href="https://apidocs.polytomic.com">https://apidocs.polytomic.com</a>).</p><p>Connect is an API you can use in your own products to either pull your customers’ data into your own systems, or push data from your own systems to your customers’, or both. We have first-class support for data warehouses too. And there&#39;s a self-hosted deployment option.</p><p>You can set up automatic data syncs in any direction between data warehouses, databases (including CDC streaming), cloud applications (e.g. Salesforce, Zendesk, etc), spreadsheets, cloud storage (S3 etc), and arbitrary APIs and webhooks. We take care of authentication, automatically pushing updates, type conversions, rate limits, scaling to handle large volumes, monitoring, and alerting.</p><p>You can also sync updates from custom queries powered by data models you define as well join data across disparate systems (e.g. HubSpot + Stripe + Airtable) to sync fields from them in one payload to any destination.</p><p>You can see demo videos and code examples for a small subset of use cases here: <a href="https://apidocs.polytomic.com/guides/code-examples/overview">https://apidocs.polytomic.com/guides/code-examples/overview</a>.</p><p>We’d love to take your comments and feedback! Happy to answer questions too.</p></div></div></div>
