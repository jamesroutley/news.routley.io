This can lead to Aids (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and the body struggling to fight off infection.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In a statement, the man said: &#34;When I was diagnosed with HIV in 1988, like many others, I thought it was a death sentence.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I never thought I would live to see the day that I no longer have HIV.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, he was given the therapy not for his HIV, but because he developed the blood cancer leukaemia at the age of 63.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The man&#39;s medical team decided he needed a bone marrow transplant to replace his cancerous blood cells. By coincidence, the donor was resistant to HIV.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The virus gets into our body&#39;s white blood cells by using a microscopic doorway - a protein called CCR5.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, some people, including the donor, have CCR5 mutations that bolt the door shut and keep out HIV.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Cure-remains-Holy-Grail"><span role="text">Cure remains &#39;Holy Grail&#39;</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>The City of Hope patient was closely monitored after the transplant, and levels of the HIV became undetectable in his body.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He has now been in remission for more than 17 months.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We were thrilled to let him know that his HIV is in remission and he no longer needs to take antiretroviral therapy that he had been on for over 30 years,&#34; said Dr Jana Dickter, an infectious diseases doctor at City of Hope.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The first time this happened was in 2011 when Timothy Ray Brown - known as the Berlin Patient - became the first person in the world to be cured of HIV.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>There have now been three similar cases in the past three years.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The City of Hope patient is both the oldest patient to be treated in this way and the one who has lived with HIV for the longest time.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, bone marrow transplants are not going to revolutionise HIV treatment for the 38 million people in the world currently infected.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Dr Dickter told me: &#34;It&#39;s a complex procedure with significant potential side effects. So, it&#39;s not really a suitable option for most people living with HIV.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, researchers are looking at ways of targeting the CCR5 doorway using gene therapy as a potential treatment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The case was reported at the Aids 2022 conference in Montreal, Canada.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Commenting on the findings, Prof Sharon Lewin, president-elect of the International Aids Society, said: &#34;A cure remains the Holy Grail of HIV research.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She said there had been a &#34;handful of individual cure cases before&#34; and they provided &#34;continued hope for people living with HIV, and inspiration for the scientific community.&#34;</p></div><section data-component="tag-list"></section></article></div></div>
