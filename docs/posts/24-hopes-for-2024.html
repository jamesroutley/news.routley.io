    <p>My <a href="https://olu.online/23-hopes-for-2023">23 hopes for 2023</a> didn&#39;t all come true. I&#39;d say overall it was a pretty rough year for me in some ways, with high highs and monotonous lows, but hey, it ended on a redemptive and positive note!</p>
<p>I&#39;d say I achieved 12/23. Half really isn&#39;t bad.</p>
<p>For 2024 (once again, not wishing for world peace here, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5h01PJcHXdg">we all know what happens</a> when you do that):</p>
<ol>
<li>I hope to finish &#34;my year of make do&#34;, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7Sle1TCJSI">a challenge</a> proposed by leena norms, a YouTuber. Too long, didn&#39;t watch explanation: no buying clothes (save for categories impractical to me like bras, shoes, socks and pants), but you can make as many as you like! So far I&#39;ve successfully sewn 2.75 garments (nearly finished the Zadie Jumpsuit!) so we&#39;ll see how we go!</li>
<li>I hope to finish <a href="https://www.couchtobarbell.com/">LIFTOFF: Couch to Barbell</a>. Keep putting it off because I didn&#39;t enjoy being perceived in the gym, but I am hoping the habit will stick this time!</li>
<li>I hope to write more, maybe for YouTube, definitely here. Maybe a book?! Maybe a course?! We shall see.</li>
<li>I hope to start learning Yoruba. I would like to be able to understand basic conversations in it, and/or be able to read simple books.</li>
<li>I want more hyperlocal community, in every sense.</li>
<li>I want more online community, in every sense.</li>
<li>I hope to make my bedroom a beautiful, functional and comfortable space to be in, rather than a place to put my stuff.</li>
<li>I want to sing, dance and listen to music more.</li>
<li>I want to start masking again regularly in public areas.</li>
<li>I want to learn to swim.</li>
<li>I&#39;d like to go to a sword fighting class.</li>
<li>I&#39;d like to try a martial art class.</li>
<li>I hope to try and do morning pages at least once a week, build up to doing them regularly.</li>
<li>I&#39;d like to do some Twitch streaming on tech ethics stuff, with guests. My throat really hurt the time I tried to talk non-stop about Lensa and AI ethics for an hour, so I&#39;ve learnt my lesson.</li>
<li>I kind of hope to reckon more with consumer boycotts, consumerism, big tech and social justice. I don&#39;t know what my answer will be, but I know I have a lot more grace for the idea that there is no one &#34;utopia&#34; or technique, trick or system that will make everyone happy forever.</li>
<li>I hope to live more by my values - experimentation, rapport, joy, courage, sustainability and justice - by doing things rather than just thinking or writing about them.</li>
<li>I hope to be quicker to do something in general, even if the doing is asking a serious question or having a discussion, in all spheres of life.</li>
<li>I want to read specs and finally hit metal (aka browser implementation stuff I assume I don&#39;t care about) on JS, HTML, CSS. This is a big hope I&#39;ve hoped for years, so we&#39;ll see, lol.</li>
<li>I hope to be both less worried and less weird about social rejection.</li>
<li>I hope I&#39;m able to do more published writing this year in general, I want to pitch more.</li>
<li>I hope I get a tattoo this year.</li>
<li>I hope to get good at an instrument this year; ideally ukulele (I&#39;ve been playing it on and off for over a decade) but will take other instruments.</li>
<li>I hope I remember the lessons I learnt in 2023.</li>
<li>I hope I grow in 2024.</li>
</ol>
