I like the Acquired podcast, but am looking for reading deeper than it.</p><p>Iâ€™m reading The Big Rich about the oil boom in Texas and like it. I also liked Barbarians at the Gate about how private equity got created and how deals went down.</p><p>Less interested in people and character studies. More interested in  the mechanics of how things that we take for granted actually got built and what the world they were made in was like.</p></div></div></div>
