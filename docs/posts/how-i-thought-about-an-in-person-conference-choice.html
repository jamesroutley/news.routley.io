<p data-block-key="mkzv4">Will I go to PyCon in person this year? Today is the day I decided  whether to go; I had booked plane tickets and a hotel room, and was  running out of time to cancel them without incurring fees. So here&#39;s how  I thought about it: benefits, risks, and how much I could mitigate  those risks.</p><h3 data-block-key="8ka8p">Benefits</h3><p data-block-key="406gn">The biggest benefit to going to PyCon in person would be that I&#39;d be able to participate in <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/events/packaging-summit/">the Packaging Summit</a>. I&#39;d represent <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/new-packaging-security-funding-nyu/7792/">the work that we&#39;re doing through NYU on better securing the Python packaging toolchain</a>,  and -- through live discussion -- better understand the state of  packaging, what other people and institutions are working on, and so on.  There&#39;s no remote participation for this event, though I&#39;ve been  assured that folks will take thorough notes to share afterwards.</p><p data-block-key="141a9">Second to that: I&#39;d have ad hoc and wide-ranging conversations with  friends, acquaintances, and colleagues I haven&#39;t talked with for ages,  or have only talked with online. This would emotionally refresh and  nourish me, and intellectually I&#39;d benefit from hearing their stories  and discussing things I don&#39;t yet know I want to discuss. In case  there&#39;s conflict between me and any of my open source colleagues, live  conversations could ease things and strengthen our trust foundations to  mitigate future conflict. And conversations might lead to business  opportunities. Some of this I can get by other means, pinging them and  setting up videocalls, but the medium can get exhausting. And I wouldn&#39;t  get the serendipitous alchemy that can happen in unplanned groups.</p><p data-block-key="2h2r9">Most irreplaceably: I&#39;d have ad hoc conversations with people I don&#39;t  know yet. I need this because I don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t know, and  people drawn to the same event but from wildly different contexts might  open my world to perspectives and opportunities I&#39;ve never thought of  before. And we might become friends! This might happen via the expo  floor, in the hallway, and at mixer and Birds of a Feather events. At  some previous COVID-era PyCons, PyCon has provided a virtual meetup  function that let online attendees mingle in spontaneous group  videocalls, but it looks like that is not happening this year.</p><p data-block-key="bp104">If I were to participate in <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/events/development-sprints/">the development sprints</a>  then I could make progress on projects I care about, recruit more  participants, and have a low-pressure environment to demonstrate and  learn what it&#39;s like to work with specific other people on stuff -- that  last data point is really hard to get in other ways, and can be an  important stepping stone to other partnerships.</p><p data-block-key="5a5bf">I&#39;d get to visit Salt Lake City again. I have visited with family but never by myself, and would like to explore it a bit.</p><p data-block-key="9jo06">I would gather some information if I went to talks, and might be  inspired by keynotes. Talks are usually recorded for later viewing, but  rarely glitches happen and recordings aren&#39;t available.</p><h3 data-block-key="a45hh">Risks</h3><p data-block-key="cs2rt">It is still a bad idea to get COVID-19, and I still don&#39;t want to get  it. I am vaccinated and boosted, so if I catch COVID my chances of  having to go to the hospital or dying are lower than if I weren&#39;t  (though <a href="https://www.healthsystemtracker.org/brief/covid19-and-other-leading-causes-of-death-in-the-us/">in February, 15% of adult COVID-19 deaths in the US were among people who were vaccinated with booster</a>). My likely course would be a week of feeling awful and maybe some more weeks of feeling gross. But, as <a href="https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1515751550433443840">doctor and science communicator Bob Wachter breaks it down</a>,</p><blockquote data-block-key="32hrj">my biggest worry is that of Long Covid (LC), which I now think of in two fairly distinct buckets:</blockquote><p data-block-key="h5s0">I also don&#39;t want to give it to anyone else, especially my spouse,  and especially people who are less protected by vaccines or who have  less ability to protect themselves (such as customer service personnel).</p><p data-block-key="dfgdh">Specifically with this PyCon: the timing is difficult. If I catch  COVID on this trip and need to rest and recover, there are some specific  things in the next few weeks I won&#39;t be able to do. For example,  Leonard and I have special plans we&#39;d have to cancel. And one of my best  friends here in New York has a newborn and I&#39;m one of the people who&#39;s  on call to help out, and I would have to let her down. If my recovery  takes several weeks, I&#39;ll have to miss <a href="http://wiscon.net/">WisCon in late May</a>,  which would be particularly bad because WisCon and the Otherwise Award  are counting on me being there as the benefit auctioneer.</p><p data-block-key="e4r8p">And the BA.2 subvariant is causing an uptick in cases in the US in general, <a href="https://deq.utah.gov/water-quality/sars-cov-2-sewage-monitoring">including in Salt Lake City as measured by wastewater data</a>.</p><h3 data-block-key="8upco">Ways to mitigate risks</h3><p data-block-key="4tu68">My assessment is that the riskiest activities would be unmasked or  partially-unmasked social settings indoors, and ill-ventilated social  settings indoors.</p><p data-block-key="58gnu"><b>Other people&#39;s practices</b>: PyCon has mitigated risks with its <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/attend/health-safety-guidelines/">health and safety policy</a>.  All attendees must wear masks, and loose cloth masks don&#39;t count. And  all attendees must be recently vaccinated or vaccinated and boosted.  Both these steps reduce transmission risk. However, in the shared areas  of the conference venue, <a href="https://pycon.blogspot.com/2022/04/important-venue-information-update.html">another convention will be sharing space with us and they have no known vaccination or mask requirement</a>. And I believe neither of the convention hotels has a mask mandate in common areas such as the elevator.</p><p data-block-key="d7oq0"><b>Flight</b>: I live in New York City and flying to Salt Lake City  is, for me at this time, the only feasible way to get there and back.  Now that the US has no mask mandate for people on flights or in airports  (and has never had a COVID vaccination mandate for domestic flights), I  would be depending on one-way masking (I wear a mask even though others  don&#39;t) to keep me safe, from the moment I walk into the airport in New  York City till the moment I get into my hotel room in Salt Lake City. I  own a <a href="https://www.microcovid.org/blog/masks#modified-p100-respirators">P100 respirator</a>  and know from experience that I can wear it for several hours at a  stretch without difficulty, but going ~8 hours without eating or  drinking anything might be difficult. (N95s aren&#39;t as effective, but I  could switch to them once the plane is inflight and the high-efficiency  ventilation comes on. I have been thinking about getting N99s but hadn&#39;t  gotten around to it yet.)</p><p data-block-key="9ccga"><b>Eating</b>: To avoid taking masks off in indoor spaces with other  people, I would not eat indoors with anyone else. Or I could decide to  only do so after everyone in the room had taken an antigen test that  came out negative, which would probably only work with takeout or room  service in my or the friend&#39;s hotel room. This mitigation would reduce  the social benefits of going to the convention since so much social  availability revolves around shared meals, and lots of restaurants don&#39;t  have any outdoor dining options, plus it&#39;s forecasted to be a bit  chilly this weekend in Salt Lake City. I would reduce to a minimum time  spent in rooms with other people, especially crowded rooms, especially  when others have their masks off: so, no <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/events/pyladies-auction/">PyLadies Auction</a>, no indoor lunches, no opening reception, and so on.</p><p data-block-key="6irec">For eating, I&#39;d depend on outdoor dining, takeout/curbside pickup  from restaurants, bringing my own snacks from NYC or buying them in a  local grocery store, and eating in my room or outside (e.g. on benches  outside the venue or in local parks).</p><p data-block-key="b7fq2"><b>Ventilation</b>: Thanks to the <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2022/attend/health-safety-guidelines/">PyCon health and safety reports</a>,  I&#39;m reasonably assured of the ventilation in at least one hotel&#39;s  rooms. The Salt Palace (the convention center) probably has pretty high  ceilings. The worst moments for ventilation would probably be in the  airport, boarding and leaving the plane, sitting on the runway, and  maybe in crowded moments at the venue. I&#39;ve bought an Aranet 4 carbon  dioxide monitor (<a href="https://cleanaircrew.org/aranet4coupon/">Aranet 4 discount coupon</a>), which can be configured to update its reading once a minute, on the theory that CO2 levels are a reasonable proxy for unfiltered human exhalation and thus COVID danger levels. A high CO2  reading would prompt me to go from an N95 mask to a P100, or to leave.  I&#39;d also want to bring extra AA batteries for the monitor.</p><p data-block-key="4r2cs">To avoid indoor crowds, instead of spending a lot of time in the  venue, I&#39;d regularly go into the hallway, find people to have  conversations with, and invite them outside for walks or seated chats  outside the venue.</p><p data-block-key="ds3ms"><b>Testing</b>: One way to mitigate the risk would be for the  conference to mandate at-the-door testing, every day, for each attendee.  PyCon is not doing at-the-door testing. So I&#39;d do frequent antigen  testing myself. If you have US health insurance, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/how-to-get-your-at-home-OTC-COVID-19-test-for-free">you  are entitled to eight free over-the-counter antigen tests, per month,  per person in your household, covered by your health insurance</a>. You  can submit receipts for reimbursement -- or, big pharmacy chains like  CVS and Walgreens have the ability to put it through your insurance like  a prescription, so you pay nothing out of pocket. You have time to go  get your April tests between now and PyCon; bring them with you to Salt  Lake City.</p><p data-block-key="rfr6"><b>If I caught it</b>: As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/30/well/live/ba2-omicron-covid.html">the <i>New York Times</i> suggests in &#34;A New Wave of Covid-19 Is Coming. Here’s How to Prepare.&#34;</a>:  make a plan to get antiviral drug treatment if you need it, because  taking Paxlovid and molnupiravir early mitigate COVID symptoms and  (probably) long-term effects:</p><blockquote data-block-key="bfda3">&#34;For the pills to be most effective, you need to  start taking them within five days of the start of your symptoms, so  it’s important to have a plan for getting a prescription and knowing  which pharmacy can fill it&#34;</blockquote><p data-block-key="epqmh"><a href="https://aspr.hhs.gov/TestToTreat/Pages/default.aspx">Test-to-Treat</a>  is a program happening now in the US: &#34;Through this program, people are  able to get tested and – if they are positive and treatments are  appropriate for them – receive a prescription from a health care  provider, and have their prescription filled all at one location.&#34; <a href="https://covid-19-test-to-treat-locator-dhhs.hub.arcgis.com/">The Test-to-Treat locator says</a> there&#39;s a Salt Lake City location: <a href="https://fourthstreetclinic.org/hours-location/">Fourth Street Clinic, Wasatch Homeless Health Care, 409 West 400 South</a>, a 15-minute walk from the convention area. However, this location is not open on weekends. There&#39;s <a href="https://www.cvs.com/store-locator/west-valley-city-ut-pharmacies/5557-west-4100-south-west-valley-city-ut-84120/storeid=10424">a CVS at 5557 West 4100 South, West Valley City, UT 84120</a>  which is a 20-minute cab ride away, and which looks to be open on  weekends -- but then you have to endanger the cabdriver (which you can  mitigate by opening the windows and wearing an N95 mask).</p><p data-block-key="8l6uj">And, as the NYT points out, &#34;Make sure you have extra funds or plenty  of room on your credit card in case you need to extend your trip to  recover from Covid.&#34;</p><p data-block-key="t673">Upon getting home I would isolate in some fashion for maybe 3-5 days,  probably partially in a hotel and partly in our apartment. I&#39;d probably  test every day with an antigen test and go for a <a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/covid-19-testing-sites/">free city-provided PCR test</a> a few times during that period. And if I test positive then I&#39;d <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/covid/treatments-available.pdf">pursue antiviral treatment</a>  and see if Leonard could go stay with friends or in a hotel for a bit.  (NYC used to have a program to give free hotel rooms to people with  COVID or household members who didn&#39;t want to catch it, but <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/helpnownyc/get-help/covid-19-hotel-program.page">that&#39;s now over</a>.)</p><h3 data-block-key="bs9br">I&#39;m not going</h3><p data-block-key="90ch0">While writing this post, I&#39;ve cancelled my hotel room and air ticket.  The patchwork mitigations I could employ to protect myself and others from the most-transmissible-ever edition of COVID-19 would substantially reduce  the social benefits of the con, and be pretty exhausting. I am choosing,  with significant regret, to decline one irreplaceable experience so I  can save my risk budget for a few others (especially serving as  Otherwise auctioneer at WisCon and helping my friend with her newborn). </p>
