    <h1>Show HN: XR2000: A science fiction programming challenge</h1>

    <p>Today I’m releasing the <strong>XR2000</strong>: A programming challenge with extensive science fiction backstory. This is a project I’ve long wanted to make, and it has slowly come to life in the last few years.</p>
<p>I love a good puzzle or game that involves programming. Over the years I found a couple of these games that were particularly fun. These really inspired me to start the XR2000. Before explaining more about my new challenge, I want to mention (and recommend) these games.</p>
<h2 id="tis-100">TIS-100</h2>
<p>This is one of the weirdest games ever. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/">TIS-100</a> that lets you write assembly code for a fictional cpu. There is a complete manual documenting the CPU instructions and all peripherals. It really got me hooked on legacy computing and assembly programming.</p>
<h2 id="space-traders">Space Traders</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://spacetraders.io">Space Traders</a> you control a spaceship through a REST API. The game is mainly focused on trading (as the name suggests) and involves closely monitoring and analyzing market prices. It’s a great challenge for learning a new programming language or programming in general. The simulation has remarkable depth.</p>
<h2 id="protohackers">Protohackers</h2>
<p><a href="https://protohackers.com">Protohackers</a> is not a game but more a programming challenge like <a href="https://adventofcode.com">AoC</a> but focussed on backend and protocols. It really makes you dive into the depths of tcp, udp and sockets.</p>
<h2 id="and-now-something-different">And now something different</h2>
<p>I decided to create a challenge that combines a science fiction story with a programming challenge. The programming challenge so far is mostly focussed on binary protocols, and some cryptography.</p>
<p>The story is far from finished. There are lots of ideas on continuing the story, expanding the fictional universe and including more low level / assembly techniques. So let’s call this chapter 1. More might follow depending on the success of this first part. So let’s get ready to…</p>
<h2 id="dive-in">Dive in!</h2>
