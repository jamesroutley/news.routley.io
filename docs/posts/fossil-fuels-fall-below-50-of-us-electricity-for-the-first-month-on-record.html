    <h1>Fossil fuels fall below 50% of US electricity for the first month on record</h1>

            <p><span>The milestone is the result of a long term decline of fossil generation in the US power sector, with wind and solar growing substantially over the last decade. Ten years ago, in March 2015, fossil generation still provided 65% of US electricity generation. Wind and solar generation stood at just 5.7%. Since then, the share of wind and solar power has more than quadrupled.</span></p>
<p><span>Solar power is set to account for </span><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64586"><span>more than half</span></a><span> of new generating capacity installed in the US in 2025, with more than a third of new solar panels going to Texas. Solarâ€™s rise has been extraordinary. Ten years ago, in March 2015, solar power accounted for just 1% of US electricity generation. By March 2025, this had grown to 9.2%.</span></p>
<p><span>Last month Ember published a special report, </span><a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/us-electricity-2025-special-report/"><span>US Electricity 2025</span></a><span>, on the changes and trends in the US power sector last year. It found that solar was the fastest and largest growing source of electricity in the US in 2024. Wind and solar power combined rose to a record 17% of the US electricity mix in 2024, overtaking coal for the first time which accounted for 15%.</span></p>
