    <h1>Problems at Roblox</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><strong>Roblox</strong><span> (NYSE: RBLX — $38.3 billion) is a platform for children generally between six and fourteen to play online. It is also the leading platform for pedophiles. Roblox ex-employees, Roblox developers, Roblox award winners, and Roblox users have been linked to a wide array of misconduct. Roblox’s former social media manager ran a pornographic blog while employed by the company. Roblox’s official Twitter account retweeted content made by a self-described pedophile. Multiple major Roblox developers have been banned after being exposed for pedophilia. Moreover, Roblox allegedly shut down its own community forum after it became inundated with links to illegal child porn sites and Roblox’s current head of content moderation previously followed a “furry porn” account. The company has engaged in litigation and intimidation to help conceal allegations of pedophilia on the platform. There are real-world consequences.</span></p><p><span>For example, 29-year-old convicted pedophile Owain Thomas “groomed 150 children to engage in sexual activity </span><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/paedophile-groomed-150-children-engage-16258877" rel="">using Roblox</a><span>.” 60 of those children were under the age of 13 and in many cases Owain Thomas used Roblox’s in-game currency, Robux, to solicit children. In one case Owain Thomas “paid a 10-year-old victim 400 Robux to perform a sexual act while he watched him on a webcam.” A lawyer called the volume of abuse “possibly </span><a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/paedophile-groomed-150-children-engage-16258877" rel="">unprecedented</a><span>.”</span></p><p><span>In September 2020, 48-year-old registered sex offender Clinton McElroy was arrested after convincing an eight-year-old girl “into sending sexually explicit videos in exchange for </span><a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/paedo-used-roblox-online-game-22744501" rel="">Robux</a><span>.” McElroy “was previously convicted in 2018 of commercial sexual exploitation of a 14-year-old child.”</span></p><p><span>In June 2021, 18-year-old Ron Machluf was indicted for </span><a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/18-year-old-indicted-for-luring-underage-girls-online-using-roblox-671550" rel="">using Roblox</a><span> “to lure and commit sexual offenses against several girls between the ages of 7 and 12.” According to the charges, Machluf would contact girls on the game&#39;s chat and offer Robux in exchange for partially nude photos.</span></p><p><span>In July 2021, 23-year-old Terrence Barto was arrested for “indecent solicitation of a child, violation of sex offender registry and grooming” after “he contacted a 12-year-old boy in Texas </span><a href="https://www.daily-journal.com/news/crime/man-charged-with-soliciting-juvenile-through-roblox/article_d5459446-eb22-11eb-8fdc-1f1054f1f8d9.html" rel="">via Roblox</a><span>.” At the time Barto joined Roblox he was already a convicted sex offender in Washington state. In response, Roblox said, “We continually develop cutting-edge technologies to ensure the Roblox platform remains a safe and fun space for players all over the world.&#34;</span></p><p><span>In August 2021, 61-year-old John Mathew Piecuch was indicted after posing as a 13-year-old boy </span><a href="https://www.wbal.com/article/529726/3/california-man-indicted-for-child-exploitation-in-carroll-county-involving-gaming-platform-roblox" rel="">on Roblox</a><span>. He “contacted a 12-year-old girl and requested sexually explicit photos of her and her 5-year-old sibling.” Following the arrest, the Carroll County Sherriff’s Office put out an alert to warn parents that Roblox “is widely used by elementary-aged children.”</span></p><p><span>On January 24, 2022, Roblox’s founder and CEO, David Baszucki, </span><a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2022/01/2021-year-review-letter-ceo/" rel="">published</a><span> a “year in review” and outlined Roblox’s future priorities. The letter had a section devoted to “Expanding Digital Opportunities for Brands” but mentioned “safety” only once.</span></p><p><span>Two days later, Sarasota County police released a </span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21190231/21012801pca_redacted1-1.pdf" rel="">redacted probable cause affidavit</a><span> against 45-year-old Patrick Penczak “on seven felony charges involving crimes against children” including “lewd and lascivious battery on a child.” Penczak allegedly “impersonated a teenage girl” on Roblox to meet his victims and “sent electronic [Roblox] gift cards in exchange for nude photos.”</span></p><p><span>Roblox </span><a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407444339348-Safety-Civility-at-Roblox" rel="">claims</a><span> to have “a large, expertly trained team with thousands of members dedicated to protecting our users and monitoring 24/7 for inappropriate content.” That may not be enough.</span></p><p><span>For example, a mom uploaded </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a38v1NKm57Q&amp;ab_channel=WIRED" rel="">a video</a><span> showing a Roblox world with inappropriate background music including the lyrics: &#34;Let&#39;s go camping, let me touch you!&#34; &#34;16-minutes of touchy tension.&#34; &#34;Haha, I tied you up.&#34; &#34;You can cry, I just hit harder. You&#39;re wrong, now speed up faster.&#34; &#34;I rape just for my pleasure.”</span></p><p>The parent added in her video description: “This is appalling and heinous. SHUT ROBLOX DOWN!”</p><p><span>In June 2021, an anonymous Twitch streamer </span><a href="https://twitchstats.net/amp/clip/TemperedChillyQuailPJSugar-OK2D2xkCpHvgtTnN" rel="">uploaded</a><span> a clip titled “Roblox pedophile meetup!” One user wrote, “I don’t like double digits.”</span></p><p>Some of the content on Roblox is far more disturbing.</p><p><span>An August 2020 </span><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90539906/sex-lies-and-video-games-inside-roblox-war-on-porn" rel="">investigation</a><span> by </span><em>Fast Company</em><span> easily located inappropriate Roblox rooms like the one shown below. Clicking one of the signs can invite other plays to engage in inappropriate actions.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow"

href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/roblox-tos-update-banning-kissing-and-handholding-leaves-players-baffled-1670339/" rel="">updated its terms of service</a><span> to ban animations of “handholding or other romantic gestures.” That has not done much.</span></p><p><span>For example, a December 2021 video “I became a stripper </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCM2UYeVeiY&amp;ab_channel=Dopestudioz" rel="">on Roblox</a><span>” shows numerous children playing in an inappropriate environment.</span></p><p><span>Two weeks ago, another video was uploaded </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6seauSMyjCY&amp;ab_channel=feenova" rel="">titled</a><span> “ROBLOX STRIP CLUBS HAVE VOICE CHAT NOW!?” The video has over 10,000 views and a top commenter wrote, “These games are about to be crazy.”</span></p><p>In a game that claims to ban “handholding or other romantic gestures,” children can now role-play as strippers with real audio and currency. How?</p><p><span>One reason may be Roblox’s perplexing head of safety and moderation, Bob Pieron. According to his LinkedIn, Mr. Pieron manages “a team of over 800 agents around the world” in Roblox’s Trust &amp; Safety department. In 2018, YouTuber Ruben Sim </span><a href="https://youtu.be/y0BH8KXUQRQ?t=118" rel="">published</a><span> a video about Mr. Pieron’s social media activity and showed that he followed a “furry porn” account that made fantasy cartoons and sexualized cartoon animals. Mr. Pieron later changed his Twitter handle. A Bear Cave review of Mr. Pieron’s new </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BobNobleDragon" rel="">Twitter account</a><span> uncovers further peculiarities.

Roblox’s tweet remains up.</p><p>Roblox’s problem with pedophilia runs deep in its developer community as well.</p><p><span>For example, Roblox shut down its own community forum in 2017 after it was overrun with content from pedophiles including “an infamous post made by user ‘jaredpogi123kaba’… which linked to an illegal child sexual abuse site” according to a Roblox </span><a href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Forums" rel="">history site</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Another example is “</span><a href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Community:MisterObvious" rel="">MisterObvious</a><span>” a major Roblox developer who won a “Bloxy award” from Roblox for being one of the best developers in the Roblox community. The YouTuber Ruben Sim later published videos, audio, and text screenshots showing “MisterObvious” sending and soliciting inappropriate content from underage girls. In addition, in April 2017 he filed a police report and in June 2017 uploaded a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSm1NxGJKmI&amp;ab_channel=RubenSim" rel="">video on YouTube</a><span> with over a million views covering the allegations.

Instead, </span><em>People Make Games</em><span> published a new December 2021 investigation with disturbing findings including messages between a 24-year-old Roblox game developer and a 12-year-old girl. </span><a href="https://youtu.be/8Mr4a84prMc?t=308" rel="">Screenshots</a><span> show that the developer, who used a variety of pseudonyms, allegedly offered to drive to her home and suggested she could “just jump out the window and I’ll take you somewhere nice.” Despite complaints to Roblox, this developer’s high-earning Sonic the Hedgehog themed Roblox games were not suspended until December 2021 when SEGA (the company that owns the Sonic trademark) filed a copyright infringement complaint.</span></p><p>Roblox users publishing YouTube video investigations to expose Roblox developer pedophiles is disturbingly common.</p><p><span>For example, on January 12, 2022, an anonymous teenager </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=3yFblHNU7MU&amp;ab_channel=Jax" rel="">published</a><span> an investigation into Roblox developer Andrew Whicker, who allegedly sent and solicited inappropriate content from a 14-year-old.

One week later, the anonymous Youtuber </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEjWcIyhtmQ&amp;ab_channel=Jax" rel="">published</a><span> screenshots showing that another Roblox developer “LambdaCrux” solicited and sent inappropriate photos from underage Roblox users. Following the video “LambdaCrux” deleted his Roblox account.</span></p><p>On Roblox, children are publishing their own investigations to create publicity to help expose Roblox pedophiles to get Roblox to take action.</p><p>Children should not be responsible for hunting down child abusers in their own game.

Robux can be bought for roughly one cent ($0.01 USD) and developers can redeem Robux directly with Roblox for roughly one-third of one cent ($0.0035). Other non-official sites pay higher rates.  </p><p>Items bought with Robux can be resold in Roblox’s marketplace and some trade for thousands of dollars.
