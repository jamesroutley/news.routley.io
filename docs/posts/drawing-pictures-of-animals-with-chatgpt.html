    <h1>Drawing pictures of animals with ChatGPT</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><header><p><date>Sunday, January 29th 2023</date></p></header><p>IÔªø asked ChatGPT to draw some pictures for me by producing the SVG code to &#34;sketch&#34; out my requests.</p><p>fWÔªøhat did I ask for?</p><ul><li>A cat</li><li>A dog</li><li>An elephant</li><li>A walrus</li><li>A monkey</li><li>The Mona Lisa</li><li>A smiley face</li><li>A smiley face with arms (I&#39;ll explain)</li><li>The words &#34;Hello World&#34;</li></ul><p>WÔªøhat learned is that ChatGPT is... not at great at this. That or it has <em>really</em> interesting interpretation of some of these things. If you want something approaching visual accuracy and usability, you&#39;ll probably want to use another tool like <a href="https://george.mand.is/2022/07/new-elmo-fire-memes-with-dall-e-2/">DALL-E</a>. There are probably better tools out there that generate actual SVGs. I&#39;ve heard them mentioned in various newsletters and papers but not actually stumbled across one I could use in the wild yet.</p><p>CÔªøonsider this my digital refrigerator upon which I am hanging young ChatGPT&#39;s best artistic efforts.</p><p>HÔªøere&#39;s the cat:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/3896b80958dd38fda90ce78f7420e4397fd1ad8d/4a029/media/cat.png" alt="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of a cat" title="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of a cat"/></p><p>TÔªøhis was the first images I requested. I laughed when I saw the output and thought &#34;Well... okay. I guess that&#39;s an extremely minimal interpretation of a cat.&#34;</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8b51236240353c59dc5f4e5984c2a3da5992950f/b5ea5/media/dog.png" alt="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of a dog" title="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of a dog"/></p><p>Oooh, now it&#39;s getting interesting! I feel like I&#39;m seeing an obvious head, maybe the points at the bottom of the three &#34;hills&#34; could be the four arms or paws or something.</p><p>WÔªøhen I asked for an elephant, I started to notice a pattern:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/ff251f9401164780476310a82ef79eaad60298e4/98a5c/media/elephant.png" alt="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of an elephant" title="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of an elephant"/></p><p>This one was somehow even <em>more</em> abstract than the dog. The same &#34;hills&#34; and weird, iris-less and puil-less &#34;eye&#34; shape floating in the bottom remained.</p><p>BÔªøecause I still think about the adorable <a href="https://youtu.be/kn4iw6-48zM">walruses</a> I saw in <a href="https://george.mand.is/2022/06/svalbard-land-of-reindeer-unique-visa-policies-and-inexplicably-pineapples/">Svalbard</a> last summer, I decided to ask ChatGPT to draw a walrus next:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f57daced883355a14e1ce1da18778078be244545/8b122/media/walrus.png" alt="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of a walrus" title="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of a walrus"/></p><p>IÔªø&#39;ve concluded maybe ChatGPT just thinks all animals (except for cats) have weird all-seeing eyes and hilltop shapes as their base. Weirdly I feel like I could almost squint and imagine this one as a single-tusked walrus, poking its head out of the water, taking a break from scouring the seabed for clams.</p><p>IÔªø decided to try a very different kind of animal and went for a monkey:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e3b8f6b2a6f0e909a34196de34aa5a212986b8ba/cd2a9/media/monkey.png" alt="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of a monkey" title="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of a monkey"/></p><p>IÔªø had to double-check my prompt and make sure I hadn&#39;t made a mistake, because at first glance I thought this looked <em>exactly</em> like the elephant ChatGPT had given me earlier. Upon closer inspection, it basically was, except everything had been &#34;condensed&#34; a little bit, and some of the shapes in the base were subtly different.</p><p>I decided to try something harder and ask for the Mona Lisa next:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9b79da9a4d247303a82c5f0bc023cefa18a620e4/8eaf5/media/mona-lisa.png" alt="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of the Mona Lisa" title="ChatGPT&#39;s SVG rendering of the Mona Lisa"/></p><p>I&#39;m not quite sure we captured her enigmatic smile here, but it&#39;s definitely more... symmetrical than the walrus?</p><p>IÔªø should pause here to note that I did try wilder, more surrealistic prompts‚Äîthey type I&#39;m used to submitting to DALL-E. When I asked for a monkey riding a rhino like a cowboy I got this in response:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e240bb5f47cfc4bac494f48107422ed4fba76b95/4e4cc/media/limited-creativity-svgs.png" alt="Screenshot of ChatGPT explaining to me why it can&#39;t render an SVG of a monkey riding a rhino like a cowboy." title="Screenshot of ChatGPT explaining to me why it can&#39;t render an SVG of a monkey riding a rhino like a cowboy."/></p><p>KÔªøudos to knowing your limits, I suppose.</p><p>AÔªøfter that I asked for something I assumed it would be able to give me‚Äîa yellow smiley face. I audibly laughed when I saw the render, as I was reminded of probably one of the first time I&#39;d used MS Paint or something as a kid:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/092526478fb4a853d59cbc99387972dcdece1e81/39e2c/media/smiley-face.png" alt="ChatGPT drawing a yellow smiley face" title="ChatGPT drawing a yellow smiley face"/></p><p>IÔªø asked for it to draw the same thing but with arms next. My hope was to try and recreate these little <a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/743beb832bb40fd1e378c298c6c4ea46c3d27ee0e88fa9ad62cbe3fba8a12f8c/68747470733a2f2f64333377756272666b69306c36382e636c6f756466726f6e742e6e65742f616266376138333039346165373034306163306432356465323834386139626665303833323863362f31613963652f6d656469612f6d65732f6d652d7465616368696e672e6a7067">finger puppets</a> I&#39;ve used for years as avatars and in Zoom backdrops for many years:</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e9bfcbef8587c18a9a1052f97f2ddee7ec71ebf1/bc22a/media/smiley-face-arms.png" alt="ChatGPT drawing a yellow smiley face with arms" title="ChatGPT drawing a yellow smiley face with arms"/></p><p>&#34;ÔªøA&#34; for effort, I guess.</p><p>FÔªøinally, I decided to throw a curve ball and ask it to render an SVG drawing the words &#34;Hello World.&#34; DALL-E is famously bad with text and I wondered how it would handle this.</p><p>TÔªøhe very first rendition included the <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> element, which I&#39;d forgotten is part of the SVG spec. Ha! That is probably the most &#34;correct&#34; answer here, but not what I wanted. I adjusted my prompt asking for the same thing but explicitly requesting that ChatGPT <strong>not</strong> use that element.</p><p>Not only did it return a new SVG using <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> elements instead, but it gave me a surprisingly confident-sounding explanation of how the code is accomplishing this!</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e0d701b5c512626e99608054ba4d37eade261875/b2e3d/media/hello-world-explained.png" alt="ChatGPT explaining how its outputted SVG code renders the phrase SVG using quadratic Bezier curves" title="ChatGPT explaining how its outputted SVG code renders the phrase SVG using quadratic Bezier curves"/></p><p>IÔªøt said:</p><pre><code>This code creates the text &#34;Hello World&#34; by using three path elements, each with a different set of quadratic Bezier curves (Q) which forms the letters in the phrase. The first path is for the word &#34;Hello&#34;, the second path is for the word &#34;World&#34; and the third one is for the baseline. The fill attribute is set to none and the stroke attribute is set to black and stroke-width is 2.
Please note that this is a more complex example, you can find more detailed svg codes for text by searching the internet, and you can customize the code to match your needs. Also this is not a scalable method for text as vou will need to manually adiust the path for different font sizes.
</code></pre><p>IÔªø opened the SVG with eager anticipation to reveal:</p><p>![ChatGPT drawing the words &#34;Hello World&#34; with quadratic Bezier curves](/media/hello-world.png &#34;ChatGPT drawing the words \&#34;Hello World\&#34; with quadratic Bezier curves&#34;)</p><p>I guess my takeaway from all of this: while the relative safety of traditional computer engineering jobs (Ôªøamong others) may be challenged as large language models evolve, job security for SVG clipart artists feels relatively safe from the onslaught of AI üòÇ</p><p>AÔªøt least for now.</p><p>üòê</p><p>PÔªøS‚Äîfor the curious, you can view and download all of the SVGs here in a GitHub repo:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/georgemandis/chatgpt-svgs">https://github.com/georgemandis/chatgpt-svgs</a></li></ul></section></article></div></div>
