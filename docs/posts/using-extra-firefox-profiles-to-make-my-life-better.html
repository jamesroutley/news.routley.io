    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Using extra Firefox profiles to make my life better</h2>

	<p><small>October 19, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>At the moment I have two main browser instances, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/ChromeWalkingAwayII">both using Firefox</a>. My primary browsing is in <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/WhyCustomFirefoxII">my customized
Firefox</a>, with <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/Firefox104AddonsUnchanged">assorted strict settings and
extensions</a> that result in it mostly not
running JavaScript, <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/NotLoggedIn">being logged in to places</a>, and
so on. Since <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/NoJavascriptIsNotEasy">browsing with JavaScript off can be annoying</a>, I have a second Firefox instance that&#39;s
my &#39;just make it work&#39; browser; it runs JavaScript, accepts and
gives back all of those cookies, and so on, and then it throws
cookies and everything away when I close it.</p>

<p>(I implement this second stock Firefox environment not with a profile
but by changing the <code>$HOME</code> environment variable before I run this
Firefox. Firefox on Unix helpfully respects <code>$HOME</code> and having the
two environments be completely separate avoids various potential
problems.)</p>

<p>This second &#39;JavaScript&#39; Firefox environment is what I normally use
when I need to log in to sites I don&#39;t like (especially if they
want to use JavaScript, which they usually do); I log in, do whatever,
and close the browser, flushing my login session along with all of
the other cookies. However, for my sins I use a number of websites
that require both JavaScript and logins, and that have annoying or
painful login procedures. These sites do things such as requiring
multi-factor authentication every time with a physical token, or
sending email every time I log in (or just a tediously long and
slow multi-step login process). As a result I want to log in to
them as infrequently as possible, which means keeping their login
cookies.</p>

<p>(For some of these sites, I also don&#39;t want to casually browse other
places while logged in to them, because they have some degree of
important privileges. Otherwise, for some sites I could start my
JavaScript Firefox environment at the start of the day and only
exit it at the end, letting cookies and so on accumulate (only)
over the course of the day. It&#39;s not perfect, but it is lazy.)</p>

<p>My solution to this is a set of additional profiles in the &#39;JavaScript&#39;
Firefox setup, one per annoying website. Each profile gets a standard
set of Firefox addons, of which the critical ones are uBlock
Origin and Cookie AutoDelete. In each profile, I set Cookie AutoDelete
to keep the necessary cookies for the particular website (or related
set of them), and then clean up everything else. Those additional
cookies come from various things, including me browsing off that
site by following links on it. It generally takes a little bit of
initial work to figure out what sites need their cookies retained,
but once that&#39;s set up, all of these profiles have been stable and
trouble-free.</p>

<p>(In theory I could try to put limits of what websites can use
JavaScript in these profiles, but in practice it&#39;s too much of
a pain in the rear.)</p>

<p>In theory perhaps I could use something like <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Firefox Multi-Account
Containers</a>
for this, but I prefer separate profiles. They&#39;re probably more
work to set up in the beginning, but I feel more confident about
what they&#39;re doing and how various aspects interact with each other.
Profiles are definitely completely separate from each other, including
for extension settings and so on. Containers, well, it depends.</p>

<h3>Sidebar: my usual Firefox addons for these profiles</h3>

<p>In addition to uBlock Origin and Cookie AutoDelete, I also add Foxy
Gestures (which is a critical part of my Firefox experience), Cookie
Quick Manager, and generally Certainly Something (for TLS certificate
viewing). Some of these profiles have accumulated additional addons
over time, usually ones that mitigate tracking. These days I also
install <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxBookmarkletButtonsNotes">my bookmarklet buttons</a>
(for <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxReadablePraise">readable</a> and <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/web/FirefoxBookmarkletButtonsNotes">fixed</a>).</p>
