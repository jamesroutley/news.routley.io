  <h2>
    The world’s fastest and most energy-efficient 60TB SSD 
  </h2>

      
    <div><p>The Micron 6550 ION SSD is the world’s first 60TB PCIe Gen5 data center SSD, built to deliver unparalleled performance, energy efficiency and density. It’s ideal for meeting the increasing demands of AI workloads in AI data lakes, high-performance computing (HPC), big data and analytics environments. </p>
<p>With capacity up to 61.44TB, the 6550 ION SSD provides the high capacity needed for growing AI workloads while delivering best-in-class performance and up to 20% lower SSD power consumption than competitive SSDs.<sup><a href="#fn1" target="_self">1,2,3</a></sup> Its best-in-class power efficiency for AI workloads helps enable increased data center savings and sustainability.<sup><a href="#fn1" target="_self">4</a></sup></p>
<p>As the first 60TB SSD in an E3.S form factor, the 6550 ION SSD provides industry-leading storage density and helps customers reduce their data center footprint up to 67%. </p>
<p>The 6550 ION SSD is also equipped with OCP 2.5 intelligent management capabilities, helping bring cloud-scale capabilities to enterprise data centers.<sup><a href="#fn1" target="_self">5</a></sup> Designed for end-to-end security, it safeguards data with features like SED, SPDM 1.2 and secure encrypted environment (SEE).<sup><a href="#fn1" target="_self">6 </a></sup></p>
