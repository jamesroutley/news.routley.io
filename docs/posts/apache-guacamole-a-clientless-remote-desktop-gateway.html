    <h1>Apache Guacamole: a clientless remote desktop gateway</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <li>
        <h2>Access your computers from <em>anywhere</em></h2>
        <p>Because the Guacamole client is an HTML5 web application, use of your computers is not tied to any one device or location. <strong>As long as you have access to a web browser, you have access to your machines.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Keep your desktop in the cloud</h2>
        <p>Desktops accessed through Guacamole need not physically exist. With both Guacamole and a desktop operating system hosted in the cloud, you can combine the convenience of Guacamole with the resilience and flexibility of cloud computing.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Free and open source</h2>
        <p>Apache Guacamole is and will always be <strong>free and open source software</strong>. It is licensed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>, and is actively maintained by a community of developers that use Guacamole to access their own development environments.</p>
        <p>We feel this sets us apart from other remote desktop solutions, and gives us a <a href="https://guacamole.apache.org/open-source/">distinct advantage</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Built on a well-documented API</h2>
        <p>Apache Guacamole is built on its own stack of core APIs which are <a href="https://guacamole.apache.org/api-documentation/">thoroughly documented</a>, including basic tutorials and conceptual overviews in the <a href="https://guacamole.apache.org/doc/gug/">online manual</a>. These APIs allow Guacamole to be tightly integrated into other applications, whether they be open source or proprietary.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h2>Community and commercially supported</h2>
        <p>Community support for Apache Guacamole is available through <a href="https://guacamole.apache.org/support/#mailing-lists">the project&#39;s public mailing lists</a>. Dedicated commercial support is also available through <a href="https://guacamole.apache.org/support/#commercial-support">third party companies</a>.</p>
