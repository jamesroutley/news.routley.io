<p>New Raspberry Pi OS April update removes the default Pi user</p>
<h3>Why have these changes been made?</h3>
<p>According to the blog post the changes have been due to new legislation forbidding default users in the software. One of these countries is the Raspberry Pi Foundations home country, England. Companies can be fined up to 10 Million pounds or 4% of their global revenue, as well as 20 thousand pounds a day. The law was introduced to reduce the number of cyberattacks on unsecured devices with default credentials. You can find more information about this legislation here: <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59400762">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59400762</a></p>
