<p><a href="https://medium.com/plans?dimension=post_audio_button&amp;postId=e7371d2bb892&amp;source=upgrade_membership---post_audio_button----------------------------------"></a>So today I am going to generate something in the 3D Program blender. I really want a day to reflect on what I am doing — maybe this weekend. For now I am just keeping up the pace.</p>



<p id="c8b2">I had to do some basic modifications on my system — namely installing the blender python module that I had to build from <a href="https://wiki.blender.org/wiki/Building_Blender/Mac" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">source</a> — ugh — pain.</p>



<p id="f8ee">It is taking too long so I am going another direction. I am generating a python script to help me document these experiments!</p>

<p id="c425"><em>generate a python script that creates a template to document daily experiments with chatgpt generating code</em></p>
</blockquote>







<p id="1538">Creating a Python script to document daily experiments with ChatGPT generating code is a helpful way to keep track of your work and the results you obtain. Below is a simple Python script template that you can use as a starting point. This script uses the <code>input()</code> function to take notes on your experiments and stores them in a text file for future reference:import os</p>



<p id="113f">This script provides a menu where you can choose to log an experiment or quit the program. When you log an experiment, it records the current date and time along with your experiment description into the <code>experiment_log.txt</code> file. You can customize the log file’s name and structure to suit your preferences.</p>



<p id="f57c">To use the script:</p>



<ol>
<li>Save it as a Python (.py) file.</li>



<li>Run the script.</li>



<li>Follow the prompts to log your daily experiments and notes.</li>
</ol>



<p id="d72f">This simple template can be expanded to include more features like tagging, categories, or additional metadata to make it more comprehensive based on your needs.</p>







<p id="0045">I wanted to modify this script to collect more data and output as markdown — I am writing this in obsidian or nvim.</p>







<blockquote>
<p id="3aeb"><em>modify this script to output markdown and to collect the following data about an experiment: an image, a github link, an optional youtube link, a list of prompts and results (formated with code markdown), and initial summary and inspiration, and a final analysis and conclusion.</em></p>
</blockquote>







<blockquote>
<p id="46c2"><em>To modify the script to output Markdown and collect more detailed information about an experiment, including an image, GitHub link, YouTube link, prompts, results, and additional descriptions, you can use the following modified script:</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>import os</p>



<p id="b56b">This script will collect and organize more detailed information for each experiment, including prompts, results, initial summary, inspiration, and final analysis and conclusion. It generates a Markdown file (<code>experiment_log.md</code>) for documentation.</p>



<p id="cbb4">Remember to install any necessary libraries for rendering images or including links to your GitHub and YouTube pages, as those functionalities are not included in the basic script.</p>

<p id="bb62">Take a look at the experiment log in the <a href="https://github.com/msrobot0/llmlexperiments/tree/main/October23/18" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">github repository for experiment 5</a>. It needs some work, but I think it will really help me save time in documenting these experiments!</p>
