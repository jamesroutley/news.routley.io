          <div><div><p>The local <strong>mute swans (above)</strong> have provided a veritable soap opera over the years and there has been a recent development. A new pair arrived at the end of the month, and as usual were met with an unfriendly reception from our regular breeding pair. The breeding pair usually have no trouble ejecting new arrivals but this time the new pair stood up to them, and the following morning just the new pair were here. They both have orange darvic rings on the right leg and from reading one of them, 4GKP, the bird was ringed at Walthamstow in June this year. It remains to be seen whether this new pair will now be a permanent fixture.</p>
<p><strong>Kingfishers</strong> have been a regular feature here outside the breeding season for the last few years and we have been getting near-daily visits all through September.<strong> Sparrowhawk</strong> are similarly regular, and although <strong>kestrels</strong> have become less common in recent years, we did have another visit on the 19<sup>th</sup> from a bird which flew around the Skyline Tower.</p>
<p>Although <strong>reed buntings</strong> are here during the breeding season and also overwinter here, there is always a period in autumn when they go missing. They seem to have returned now though, with a few sightings in the last week of September. The similar-looking but only distantly related <strong>house sparrow (below)</strong> have had a very good breeding year here, and up to fifty birds can sometimes be seen around the bird feeders in the reed-bed near the roundhouse.</p>
