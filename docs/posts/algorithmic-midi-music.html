<p>There are a lot of things I Want to write about today</p>



<p> First I have been making algorithmic music – I take a midi file and then I process it a number of times. It’s not a genetic algorithm really, but it is evolutionary. There are three elements that change, the notes, the tempo, and the force the note is played (velocity). I can take these notes individually or in segments (bars for example), or chords (as another example).  I can fix or two elements and let the third float.   What room is there for randomness.  John Cage used the IChing.  I am reading about Olson and projective verse. What is poetry but the breath between two words. </p>
