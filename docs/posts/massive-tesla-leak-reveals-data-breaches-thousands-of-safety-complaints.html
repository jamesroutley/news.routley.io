    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>Tesla has failed to adequately protect data from customers, employees and business partners and has received thousands of customer complaints regarding the carmaker’s driver assistance system, <a href="https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html" data-link-name="in body link">Germany’s Handelsblatt has reported</a>, citing 100 gigabytes of confidential data leaked by a whistleblower.</p><p>The Handelsblatt report said customer data could be found “in abundance” in a data set labelled “Tesla Files”.</p><p>The files include tables containing more than 100,000 names of former and current employees, including the social security number of the Tesla CEO, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk" data-component="auto-linked-tag" data-link-name="in body link">Elon Musk</a>, along with private email addresses, phone numbers, salaries of employees, bank details of customers and secret details from production, according to Handelsblatt.</p><p>The breach would violate the GDPR, the newspaper said.</p><p>The Guardian has not independently verified the documents.</p><p>The data protection office in Brandenburg, which is home to Tesla’s European gigafactory, described the data leak as “massive”.</p><p>“I can’t remember such a scale,” the Brandenburg data protection officer, Dagmar Hartge, said.</p><p>If such a violation was proved, Tesla could be fined up to 4% of its annual sales, which could be €3.26bn ($3.5bn).</p><p>Citing the leaked files, the newspaper also reported about large numbers of customer complaints regarding the Tesla’s driver assistance programs, with about 4,000 complaints on sudden acceleration or phantom braking.</p><p>The German union IG Metall said the revelations were “disturbing” and called on Tesla to inform employees about all data protection violations and promote a culture in which staff could raise problems and grievances openly and without fear.</p><p>“These revelations ... fit with the picture that we have gained in just under two years,” said Dirk Schulze, IG Metall incoming district manager for Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony.</p><p>Handelsblatt quoted a lawyer for Tesla as saying a “disgruntled former employee” had abused their access as a service technician, adding that the company would take legal action against the individual it suspected of the leak.</p><p>The data protection watchdog for the Netherlands said on Friday it was aware of possible Tesla data protection breaches.</p><p>“We are aware of the Handelsblatt story and we are looking into it,” said a spokesperson for the AP data watchdog in the Netherlands, where Tesla’s European headquarters is located.</p><p>The agency declined all comment on whether it might launch or have launched an investigation, citing policy.
