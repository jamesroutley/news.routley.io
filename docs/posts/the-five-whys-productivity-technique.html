    <h1>The &#34;five whys&#34; productivity technique</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              <p>We all strive to be more productive. But does that mean waking up at the crack of dawn for a morning workout, and squeezing in 3 hours on your side-hustle, all before starting work? </p><p>Definitely not. At least, not for everyone! </p><p>Being more productive means being smarter about how you spend your time. That means you can get more done in less time, and take on high-impact projects… instead of spending time on unimportant, time-consuming tasks. </p><p>Being productive also means you <em>complete</em> tasks — nothing feels better than crossing something off your to-do list! And of course, being productive means you can spend more time doing things you enjoy: like spending time with family and friends, honing a skill, enjoying a hobby, or furthering your career. </p><p>When your productivity takes a nosedive, it adds stress and anxiety, as you don&#39;t have enough time to accomplish your goals and do what really matters to you. Understanding <em>why</em> your productivity is flailing will help you get back on track.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.tuzzit.com/en/creator/sakichi_toyoda">5 Whys technique</a> was developed in the 1930s by Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of the automotive manufacturer Toyota Industries. The idea is simple: ask &#34;why&#34; 5 times, until you get to the root cause of your issue. It&#39;s not dissimilar to a kid who exasperates their parents by continually repeating &#34;why&#34;... but the benefits can be transformative!</p><p>The goal of the 5 Whys problem-solving method is to <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/how-to-learn-from-mistakes-faster/">reach the root cause of an issue faster</a> — and to drill down to counter measures. </p><p><strong>Solutions</strong> solve for symptoms, and they might be short-term fixes; whereas <strong>counter measures </strong>propose a preventative response to the problem — ensuring it doesn&#39;t recur in the long term.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/11/01_The-5-Whys.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1200" height="1054" srcset="https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/01_The-5-Whys.png 600w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/01_The-5-Whys.png 1000w, https://blog.superhuman.com/content/images/2021/11/01_The-5-Whys.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h2 id="step-1-define-the-problem">Step 1: Define the problem</h2><p>Your goal is to find the root of your productivity issues.  </p><p>Your starting point is defining the problem: &#34;I&#39;m always busy, but I don&#39;t feel productive with my time.&#34;</p><h2 id="step-2-ask-why-5-times">Step 2: Ask why… 5 times</h2><p>Rephrase the problem you&#39;ve just defined as a &#34;Why&#34; question. </p><p><em>WHY #1: Why am I always busy but I don’t feel productive with my time?&#34;</em></p><p><em>WHY #2 Why do I get distracted easily by email?</em></p><p><em>WHY #3 Why am I constantly tempted to check my email, rather than work on important projects?</em></p><p><em>WHY #4 Why do I want to be very responsive?</em></p><p><em>WHY #5 Why don&#39;t I want to miss important email, and have urgent messages sitting unread?</em></p><p>Note: You don&#39;t have to stop at 5. If you think you can keep going deeper, do. </p><p><em>WHY #6: Why am I worried my manager or colleagues will think I&#39;m not doing my job effectively? </em></p><h2 id="step-3-address-the-root-cause-of-the-issue">Step 3: Address the root cause of the issue</h2><p>Now that you&#39;ve established the root cause of your low productivity — your worries about hitting the quarter&#39;s difficult goals — you can set counter measures to avoid feeling blocked and distracted by the pressure of these goals. For example:</p><ul><li>Speaking with your manager about setting achievable goals, or revisiting the goals you set at the beginning of the quarter.</li><li>Aligning with your team about communication norms, so you don&#39;t feel under pressure to check your email constantly. </li></ul><h2 id="step-4-tackle-secondary-factors">Step 4: Tackle secondary factors</h2><p>Through the 5 Whys process, you can identify the root cause of your productivity issue, as well as secondary factors. </p><p>In our example, email isn&#39;t the <em>root</em> of the productivity problem, but it&#39;s a distracting time waster (more on that later). There are ways to tackle this: email power users use <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/9-ways-to-get-through-your-inbox-twice-as-fast/">these techniques to reduce inbox anxiety and get through email twice as fast</a>.

Your phone offers a weekly review of your screen time usage — or you can use an app like <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> to keep tabs on your desktop usage.</li><li>Turn off notifications and set time blockers on your social media so that you can only access your accounts during certain times, or for a limited amount of time every day (similar to parental blocks). <a href="https://blog.superhuman.com/how-procrastination-makes-you-even-more-productive/">Intentional procrastination can make you even more productive</a>... as long as it&#39;s time-boxed!</li><li>Apps like <a href="https://offtime.app/index.php">Offtime</a> block distracting apps like social media. Or <a href="https://www.flipdapp.co/">Flipd</a> can block your phone for a predetermined amount of time, so you cannot access it while you&#39;re busy with work or family. </li></ul><p>Even with a crystal-clear understanding of the root causes of your productivity problem, <a href="https://toggl.com/track/time-wasters/">time wasters</a> can consume your time and derail your progress.  </p><p>For example, social media can be a delightful break for your brain... but sometimes you fall down a rabbit hole of memes and cute cat videos, and spend much longer than you intended. We spend an average of <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/433871/daily-social-media-usage-worldwide/#:~:text=How%20much%20time%20do%20people,minutes%20in%20the%20previous%20year.">145 minutes</a> (or almost 2.5 hours) per day on social media, and even more hours checking and responding to email. </p><p>The result? You&#39;re under even more time pressure, and further away from achieving your goals. Here&#39;s how to squash 6 common time wasters. </p><h2 id="6-time-wasters">6 time wasters</h2><p><strong>1. Meetings with no agenda</strong></p><p><strong>2. Wasting time on busywork</strong></p><p><strong>3. Poor communication</strong></p><p><strong>4. Forever planning</strong></p><p><strong>5.

After all, you need to respond to email from your boss, team, or clients. But sorting through newsletters or sales promotions can kill your productivity. </p><p>So how can you remain productive while limiting the time it takes to work through email? You need an email client that removes distractions by separating the most important email (from humans) from newsletters. And one that lets you fly through emails quickly and efficiently, so you can save valuable time. </p><p>Superhuman was designed to provide a seamless email experience while helping you maximize your productivity.
