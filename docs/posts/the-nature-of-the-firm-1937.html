<p>&#34;<b>The Nature of the Firm</b>&#34; (1937) is an article by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Coase" title="Ronald Coase">Ronald Coase</a>. It offered an economic explanation of why individuals choose to form partnerships, companies and other business entities rather than trading bilaterally through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract" title="Contract">contracts</a> on a market. The author was awarded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences" title="Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences">Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences</a> in 1991 in part due to this paper.  Despite the honor, the paper was written when Coase was an undergraduate and he described it later in life as &#34;little more than an undergraduate essay.&#34;<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>

<h2><span id="Summary">Summary</span><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Nature_of_the_Firm&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1" title="Edit section: Summary">edit</a><span>]</span></span></h2>
<p>Given that production could be carried on without any organization, Coase asks, &#34;Why and under what conditions should we expect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firm" title="Firm">firms</a> to emerge?&#34; Since modern firms can only emerge when an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur" title="Entrepreneur">entrepreneur</a> of some sort begins to hire people, Coase&#39;s analysis proceeds by considering the conditions under which it makes sense for an entrepreneur to seek hired help instead of contracting out for some particular task.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>The traditional economic theory of the time suggested that, because the market is &#34;efficient&#34; (that is, those who are best at providing each good or service most cheaply are already doing so), it should always be cheaper to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing" title="Outsourcing">contract out</a> than to hire.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Coase noted, however, that there are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_costs" title="Transaction costs">transaction costs</a> to using the market; the cost of obtaining a good or service via the market is actually more than just the price of the good. Other costs, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_cost" title="Search cost">search</a> and information costs, bargaining costs, keeping <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_secret" title="Trade secret">trade secrets</a>, and policing and enforcement costs, can all potentially add to the cost of procuring something via the market. This suggests that firms will arise when they can arrange to produce what they need internally, and somehow avoid these costs.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>There is a natural limit to what can be produced internally, however. Coase notices &#34;decreasing returns to the entrepreneur function&#34;, including increasing overhead costs and increasing propensity for an overwhelmed manager to make mistakes in resource allocation.  This is a countervailing cost to the use of the firm.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-3"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Coase argues that the size of a firm (as measured by how many contractual relations are &#34;internal&#34; to the firm and how many &#34;external&#34;) is a result of finding an optimal balance between the competing tendencies of the costs outlined above.  In general, making the firm larger will initially be advantageous, but the decreasing returns indicated above will eventually kick in, preventing the firm from growing indefinitely.
</p><p>Other things being equal (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceteris_paribus" title="Ceteris paribus">ceteris paribus</a>), a firm will tend to be larger:
</p>
<ul><li>the less the costs of organizing and the slower these costs rise with an increase in the transactions organized.</li>
<li>the less likely the entrepreneur is to make mistakes and the smaller the increase in mistakes with an increase in the transactions organized.</li>
<li>the greater the lowering (or the less the rise) in the supply price of factors of production to firms of larger size.</li></ul>
<p>The first two costs will increase with the spatial distribution of the transactions organized and the dissimilarity of the transactions. This explains why firms tend to either be in different geographic locations or to perform different functions. Additionally, technology changes that mitigate the cost of organizing transactions across space will cause firms to be larger—the advent of the telephone and cheap air travel, for example, would be expected to increase the size of firms. On a related note the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">internet</a> and related modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_Communication_technology" title="Information and Communication technology">information and communication technologies</a> seem to lead to the existence of so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_organization" title="Virtual organization">virtual organizations</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-4"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>Coase does not consider non-contractual relationships, as between friends or family.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-5"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup>

<p>In 1991, Coase was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank (Bank of Sweden) Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.  His paper provided a breakthrough on the significance of transaction costs and property rights for the institutional structure and functioning of the economy.<sup id="cite_ref-nome_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-nome-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>The paper has had an outsized impact on the field of microeconomics, particularly in essentially inventing the body of research that deals with the theory of the firm. The paper has been cited more than 40,000 times as of March 2019, according to Google Scholar.
</p><p>This article was famously referred by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yochai_Benkler" title="Yochai Benkler">Yochai Benkler</a> in his article &#34;Coase&#39;s Penguin, or, Linux and The Nature of the Firm&#34;,<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> where he links Coase&#39;s essay to the emergence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production" title="Commons-based peer production">commons-based peer production</a> communities using the Internet. In particular, Benkler considers the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commons-based_peer_production" title="Commons-based peer production">commons-based peer production</a> a third alternative co-ordination mechanism for economic transactions besides the dichotomy composed by markets and hierarchies. In the article&#39;s title, ‘penguin’ refers to the logo of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" title="Linux">Linux</a> operating system, invoking the challenge that it poses to Coase&#39;s work by working through different mechanisms than those present in markets and firms. Resolving this challenge, according to Benkler, lies in substituting the role of transaction costs in Coase&#39;s work with the concept of information opportunity costs when explaining the emergence of commons-based peer production.  
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank" title="World Bank">World Bank</a>&#39;s 2019 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Development_Report" title="World Development Report">World Development Report</a> on <i>The Changing Nature of Work</i><sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> suggests that firms and production processes become less vertically integrated as technology makes it cheaper to resort to the open market to complete portions of the production process.
</p><p>The paper continues to inspire new areas of inquiry. For example, on its 80th anniversary, an homage was paid to it by extending its logic to the field of blockchains.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
