    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>~*~ © Code Storage by the Pierre Computer Company, Inc. ~*~</p><p>Use Code Storage to programatically create Git repositories and manage them with a simple API. No more rate limits, complicated auth-flows, or other limitations. Just create repos whenever you need them, and start pushing.</p><p>Perfect for AI-driven coding platforms, agentic frameworks, and more. Code Storage is an API-first Git infrastructure layer built to meet the highest standards of speed, scale, and reliability.</p><p>Use our ultra low-latency Git cloud to read/write files from anywhere – bringing classic Git workflows like branches, commits, and merge strategies as well as novel concepts like ephemeral branches, in-memory writes, cold storage, grep, and more directly into your product.</p><p>Whether you&#39;re building a new codegen platform, agentic framework, or just storing code-like artifacts that change over time, let us handle the infrastructure so you can focus on your product.</p><div><pre><code><span>const</span> store  = <span>new</span> <span>GitStorage</span>({ <span>name</span>: <span>&#39;test&#39;</span>, key });
<span>const</span> repo   = <span>await</span> store.<span>createRepo</span>(<span>&#39;repo&#39;</span>);
<span>const</span> remote = <span>await</span> repo.<span>getRemoteUrl</span>(); </code></pre></div><h2>Performance &amp; Scale</h2><p>Code Storage is designed for modern workloads: Vibe Coding platforms generating 1m+ new repos a day, AI copilots writing thousands of commits per session, teams branching and merging in real time, and apps syncing code across devices.</p><ul><li><span>60x faster clones than all r2/s3-based storage solutions</span></li><li><span>Sharded on top of distributed Git ref storage and replicated 3+ times for availability</span></li><li><span>Colocated near your agents or managed directly on your hardware</span></li><li><span>Warm and Cold storage solutions for maximum latency control over stale and hot repositories.</span></li></ul><p>Our customers routinely move from tens of seconds of latency (sandboxes + r2 or GitHub sync engines) to sub-second read/writes after switching to Code Storage.</p><h2>Reliability &amp; Uptime</h2><p>Your users expect their code to always be there.
