    <h1>Nvidia’s latest GPU drivers can upscale old blurry YouTube videos</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nvidia is releasing new GPU drivers today that will upscale old blurry web videos on RTX 30- and 40-series cards. <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/02/28/rtx-video-super-resolution/">RTX Video Super Resolution</a> is a new AI upscaling technology from Nvidia that works inside Chrome or Edge to improve any video in a browser by sharpening the edges of objects and reducing video artifacts.</p><p>Nvidia will support videos between 360p and 1440p up to 144Hz in frame rate and upscale all the way up to 4K resolution. This impressive 4K upscaling has previously only been available <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402819/nvidia-shield-tv-update-4k-upscaling-remote-customize">on Nvidia’s Shield TV</a>, but recent advances to the Chromium engine have allowed Nvidia to bring this to its latest RTX 30- and 40-series cards.</p><p>As this works on any web video, you could use it to upscale content from Twitch or even streaming apps like Netflix where you typically have to pay extra for 4K streams. Given this technique was already impressive on the Shield TV, we’re bound to see plenty of examples of where this can be applied to improve old and blurry YouTube videos.</p><p>Nvidia has been using AI techniques for years to improve games and videos, with its Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) system being the most widely used. Nvidia also launched a driver last year that included <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884124/nvidia-deep-learning-dynamic-super-resolution-game-ready-driver-ai-upscaling">Deep Learning Dynamic Super Resolution</a> (DLDSR) to render games at a higher resolution than your monitor can handle to improve image quality. Nvidia also launched its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/12/23552606/nvidia-broadcast-1-4-eye-contact-ai-generation-webcam">Eye Contact feature for Nvidia Broadcast</a> last month, which uses AI to make it appear like you’re making eye contact during video calls.</p></div></div></div>
