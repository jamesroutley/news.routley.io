    <h1>Nvidia’s latest GPU drivers can upscale old blurry YouTube videos</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="bsf_rt_marker"><div data-url="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/02/28/rtx-video-super-resolution/" data-title="Pixel Perfect: RTX Video Super Resolution Now Available for GeForce RTX 40 and 30 Series GPUs" data-hashtags=""><p>Streaming video on PCs through Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers is getting a GeForce RTX-sized upgrade today with the release of RTX Video Super Resolution (VSR).</p>
<p>Nearly 80% of internet bandwidth today is streaming video. And 90% of that content streams at 1080p or lower, including from popular sources like Twitch.tv, YouTube, Netflix, Disney+ and Hulu.</p>
<p>However, when viewers use displays higher than 1080p — as do many PC users — the browser must scale the video to match the resolution of the display. Most browsers use basic upscaling techniques, which result in final images that are soft or blurry.</p>
<p>With RTX VSR, GeForce RTX 40 and 30 Series GPU users can tap AI to upscale lower-resolution content up to 4K, matching their display resolution. The AI removes blocky compression artifacts and improves the video’s sharpness and clarity.</p>
<p>Just like putting on a pair of prescription glasses can instantly snap the world into focus, RTX Video Super Resolution gives viewers on GeForce RTX 40 and 30 Series PCs a clear picture into the world of streaming video.</p>
<p>RTX VSR is available now as part of the latest GeForce Game Ready Driver, which delivers the best experience for new game launches like <i>Atomic Heart </i>and <i>THE FINALS </i>closed beta.</p>
<h2><b>The Evolution of AI Upscaling</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/02/03/what-is-ai-upscaling/">AI upscaling</a> is the process of converting lower-resolution media to a higher resolution by putting low-resolution images through a deep learning model to predict the high-resolution versions. To make these predictions with high accuracy, a neural network model must be trained on countless images at different resolutions.</p>

Using AI to upscale streamed video makes lower-resolution images fit with unrivaled crispness.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The deployed AI model can then take low-resolution video and produce incredible sharpness and enhanced details that no traditional scaler can recreate. Edges look sharper, hair looks scruffier and landscapes pop with striking clarity.</p>
<p>In 2019, an early version of this technology was released with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/shield-tv/">SHIELD TV</a>. It was a breakthrough that improved streamed content targeted for TVs, mostly ranging from 480p to 1080p, and optimized for a 10-foot viewing experience.</p>
<p>PC viewers are typically seated much closer than TV viewers to their displays, requiring a higher level of processing and refinement for upscaling. With GeForce RTX 40 and 30 Series GPUs, users now have extremely powerful AI processors with Tensor Cores, enabling a new generation of AI upscaling through RTX VSR.</p>
<h2><b>How RTX Video Super Resolution Works</b></h2>
<p>RTX VSR is a breakthrough in AI pixel processing that dramatically improves the quality of streamed video content beyond edge detection and feature sharpening.</p>
<p>Blocky compression artifacts are a persistent issue in streamed video. Whether the fault of the server, the client or the content itself, issues often become amplified with traditional upscaling, leaving a less pleasant visual experience for those watching streamed content.</p>

<p>RTX VSR reduces or eliminates artifacts caused by compressing video — such as blockiness, ringing artifacts around edges, washout of high-frequency details and banding on flat areas — while reducing lost textures. It also sharpens edges and details.</p>
<p>The technology uses a deep learning network that performs upscaling and compression artifact reduction in a single pass. The network analyzes the lower-resolution video frame and predicts the residual image at the target resolution. This residual image is then superimposed on top of a traditional upscaled image, correcting artifact errors and sharpening edges to match the output resolution.</p>
<p>The deep learning network is trained on a wide range of content with various compression levels. It learns about types of compression artifacts present in low-resolution or low-quality videos that are otherwise absent in uncompressed images as a reference for network training. Extensive visual evaluation is employed to ensure that the generated model is effective on nearly all real-world and gaming content.</p>

<h2><b>Getting Started</b></h2>
<p>RTX VSR requires a GeForce RTX 40 or 30 Series GPU and works with nearly all content streamed in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>The feature also requires updating to the latest <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/game-ready-drivers/">GeForce Game Ready Driver</a>, available today, or the next <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/studio/">NVIDIA Studio Driver</a> releasing in March. Both Chrome (version 110.0.5481.105 or higher) and Edge (version 110.0.1587.56) have updated recently to support RTX VSR.</p>
<p>To enable it, launch the NVIDIA Control Panel and open “Adjust video image settings.” Check the super resolution box under “RTX video enhancement” and select a quality from one to four — ranging from the lowest impact on GPU performance to the highest level of upscaling improvement.</p>
