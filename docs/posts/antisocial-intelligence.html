    <h1>Antisocial Intelligence</h1>

                    <p>I used ChatGPT the other day to optimize some software I&#39;m working on.</p>
<p>I asked it for a particular kind of data structure and an algorithm that could efficiently associate and query sparse
ranges with data, and it gave me a solution. It described a data structure and gave me an implementation that
mostly worked. With a few minor adjustments, the benchmark I was trying to make faster got about 90% faster.</p>
<p>I had a problem and I solved it quickly with AI. A technological success story! Hooray!</p>

<p>Except it wasn&#39;t: <strong>it made me feel shitty</strong>. AI robbed me of asking my friends for help.</p>

<p>If I had run into this problem a few years ago, it would&#39;ve likely gone differently:</p>
<ul>
<li>I would have asked my programming friends for help</li>
<li>They would have helped point me in the right direction</li>
<li>I would have then worked through the problem and been excited to share the results</li>
<li>I would have felt good and thanked them</li>
<li>They would feel good about having helped me</li>
</ul>
<p>Instead, I was handed a solution from a network of glorified water heaters.</p>

<p>About 25 years ago, I befriended a community of indie game developers. I was a teenager who just had gotten access to
the Internet and I wanted to make video games. Looking around the web, I found some programmers who made games and game
making tools together.</p>
<p>I asked dumb questions, made silly games, shared what I learned, helped each other, and as a result I became a better
programmer.</p>
<p>Over the years, I stayed in contact with them, and after my first job out of college I ended up working with some of
them in real life at a company called IMVU.</p>
<p>Working with them was an experience I look back on fondly. We worked well together, learned from each other, and kept
pushing each other. I think of the years I spent at IMVU as formative stepping stones for my skills and career.</p>
<p>I was very lucky to have found that group at that time. And that luck was created and strengthened by asking dumb
questions, making silly games, sharing what I learned, and helping each other.</p>
<p>And I would not have grown as much without them.</p>
<a id="ai-is-antisocial-intelligence" href="#ai-is-antisocial-intelligence"><h2>AI is antisocial intelligence</h2></a>
<p>And now we have LLMs: tools that let you avoid the discomfort of asking for help.</p>
<p>These tools are impressive, but they rob us of this discomfort. Asking for help and offering help is what strengthens
bonds between people.</p>
<p>And without these bonds, what are we?</p>

<p>I used to think of myself as a &#34;self-taught&#34; programmer, but that is a lie. I learned from my friends by asking
questions and sharing what I&#39;ve made.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the same sentiment Arnold Schwarzenegger shares <a href="https://youtu.be/RJsvR_gSEjg?si=Ez08FiPHqLERuf6_&amp;t=1062">in his speech at the University of
Houston</a>:</p>
<p><em>&#34;As soon as you understand that you are here because of a lot of helpâ€”then you also understand that now is time to
help others. That&#39;s what this is all about, you&#39;ve got to help others. Don&#39;t just think about yourself. Help others.&#34;</em></p>
