<p>(A true story.)</p>
<p>Philip (President): Our factory is underutilized by 10%. Either we start building more of our backlog or we lay people off. I&#39;d rather keep everyone busy, build inventory, and get ahead of the curve before the busy season. How can we do that?</p>
<p>Lee (Operations Manager): Company policy restricts us from building more than 3 months of backlog. If you just change that to 4 months, we&#39;ll have plenty of work.</p>
<p>Philip: Done. Now how do we implement that?</p>
<p>Lee: I&#39;m not really sure. I think we&#39;d have to change a setting in the legacy software.</p>
<p>David (IT Director): No problem. It&#39;s probably one line of code in our core routine. Fill out a ticket and submit it to IT Services.</p>
<p>Judy (IT Admin): I&#39;m assigning this request Ticket# 129281. But it still needs the section on Business Impact completed and Director approval.</p>
<p>David: It&#39;s for Philip. It we don&#39;t do this right away, we&#39;ll have to have a layoff.</p>
<p>Judy: OK, then I&#39;ll fill out that section myself and put this on the fast track.</p>
<p>2 days later.</p>
<p>David: What&#39;s the status of 129281?</p>
<p>Judy: It&#39;s the first Enhancement in the Developer Queue, after 14 Bug Reports.</p>
<p>David: Forget the queue. Mark it urgent and send it to Ed immediately.</p>
<p>1 hour later.</p>
<p>Ed (programmer): On line 1252 of Module ORP572, I changed the hard-coded variable MonthsOfBacklog from &#34;3&#34; to &#34;4&#34;. I unit tested this successfully and ran 2 batch test runs. The Operations work queue increased 10% as expected. This is good to go. I just submitted it to Code Review and moved in to Homer for User Acceptance Testing.</p>
<p>Shirley (Code Review): It is now against company policy to have any hard-coded variables. You will have to make this a record in the Parameters file. Also, there are 2 old Debug commands, an unassigned variable warning message, and a hard-coded Employee ID that will all have to be fixed before this module can be moved to production.</p>
<p>Ed: Fuck that shit.</p>
<p>Shirley: That may very well be true. But since you were assigned ORP572, you are responsible for fixing preexisting errors that violate new company policy. I cannot promote this as it is.</p>
<p>2 hours later.</p>
<p>Ed: OK, done. I just resubmitted it to Code Review.</p>
<p>Julie (IT Testing): Homer is not available for User Acceptance Testing because Fred is running a controlled test for month-end accounting close. Use Marge instead.</p>
<p>Ed: I don&#39;t have access to Marge.</p>
<p>Julie: Then contact Joe in IT Security. He&#39;ll get you permissions.</p>
<p>2 hours later.</p>
<p>Joe (IT Security): I cannot grant you access to Marge without David&#39;s signature. He&#39;s out of town. Can this wait until Monday?</p>
<p>Ed: I don&#39;t think so. Philip wants this right away. Get him to grant access.</p>
<p>Shirley: Your new Parameters record &#34;MonthsOfDemand&#34; needs a better name. The offshore programmers won&#39;t understand what this means. Also, it should have an audit trail of changes.</p>
<p>Ed: What policy is that?</p>
<p>Shirley: It&#39;s not exactly written down anywhere. The offshore team is 3 months late updating the wiki, but I assure you, all new Parameter records must satisfy new naming requirements and keep audit trails.</p>
<p>1 day later:</p>
<p>Ed: I renamed the Parameters record &#34;MonthsOfDemand&#34; to &#34;SelectedMonthsOfBacklogDemand&#34; and added Module PAR634 to maintain that record and its audit trail. I have submitted it to Code Review.</p>
<p>Tony (IT Testing): I see 129281 on Marge, but I have no Test Plan.</p>
<p>Ed: Just run it the old way and the new way and note the increase in the total on the WorkOrdersHours report.</p>
<p>Tony: That&#39;s your test plan? No. This affects everything in the factory. I have to have user selected Test Cases, Expected Results, documented Test Runs, and user sign-off.</p>
<p>2 days later:</p>
<p>Philip: David, tell Tony to move Ed&#39;s program to production immediately.</p>
<p>David: Yes sir.</p>
<p>Total elapsed time: 6 days.</p>
