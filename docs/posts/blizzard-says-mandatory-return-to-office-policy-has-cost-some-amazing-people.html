    <h1>Blizzard says mandatory return-to-office policy has &#39;cost some amazing people&#39;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-body">
<p>Activision Blizzard&#39;s mandatory return-to-office policy is causing an unnecessary loss of talent, to the point where it could affect development of major titles like World of Warcraft and Diablo 4, according to some Blizzard developers.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-diablo-iv-world-warcraft-remote-work-delays-1850421033" data-url="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-diablo-iv-world-warcraft-remote-work-delays-1850421033">Kotaku</a>, the company mandated that Activision employees return to the office for three days a week on April 10 this year, while Blizzard workers would be expected to follow suit on July 10. But several developers have spoken out about the ramifications this has had for employment.</p><p>&#34;Being loud about it because I&#39;ve lost yet *another* person this week,&#34; game producer Adam &#34;Glaxigrav&#34; tweeted in April. &#34;Blizzard is losing amazing talent because someone in power doesn&#39;t listen to the game directors who make his products.&#34; Adam further stated that &#34;We are creating crisis maps of what we can or cannot ship. THAT is the loss of capacity we&#39;re facing.&#34;</p><div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Being loud about it because I&#39;ve lost yet *another* person this week.

The same employee also speculated that Blizzard is &#34;tightening its belt right now and they want people to leave&#34;, which may affect Blizzard&#39;s plans for Diablo IV&#39;s post-release updates.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that the mandatory office attendance doesn&#39;t apply to ABK&#39;s executives. Recently hired execs like Chief Administrative Officer Brian Bulatao, and Chief Communications Officer Lulu Cheng Meservey, have full-time remote status.</p><p>Return to office policies have been a divisive subject in the games industry of late. Recently, a Unity manager <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/unity-manager-publicly-states-company-is-out-of-touch-is-fired-within-three-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was fired</a><span> (opens in new tab)</span> after referring to an exec&#39;s RTO solution as &#34;out of touch&#34; on Twitter. Meanwhile, other companies like <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/bungie-employees-will-work-from-home-indefinitely-due-to-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bungie </a><span> (opens in new tab)</span>and Respawn Entertainment have fully embraced remote-working.</p>
