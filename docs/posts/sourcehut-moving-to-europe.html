    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Just received this:</p><p>Hello!</p><p>I&#39;m writing to let you know that, as part of our work to move our
business operations from the United States to Europe, we are rolling out
changes to our terms of service and privacy policy. As promised, we are
giving you two weeks notice and a chance to participate in the
discussion about the proposed changes.</p><p>You can review the diff of the proposed changes on the sr.ht-dev mailing
list:</p><p>https://lists.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-dev/patches/60282</p><p>The changes will take effect from July 10th, provided that there are no
further revisions based on user feedback. Further changes will be
discussed on sr.ht-dev rather than emailed to you directly.</p><p>If you have questions or comments, you can participate in this thread,
or you can reply to this email to reach support directly.</p><p>--
