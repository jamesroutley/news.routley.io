    <div><div><div><p>Copyright’s reach is already far too broad, and courts have no business expanding it any further, particularly where that reframing will undermine adversarial interoperability. Unfortunately, a federal district court did just that in the latest iteration of <em>Oracle v. Rimini</em>, concluding that software Rimini developed was a “derivative work” because it was intended to interoperate with Oracle&#39;s software, even though the update didn’t use any of Oracle’s copyrightable code.</p>
<blockquote><p><em> [t]he work that Micro Star infringes is the [Duke Nukem] story itself—a beefy commando type named Duke who wanders around post-Apocalypse Los Angeles, shooting Pig Cops with a gun, lobbing hand grenades, searching for medkits and steroids, using a jetpack to leap over obstacles, blowing up gas tanks, avoiding radioactive slime. A copyright owner holds the right to create sequels and the stories told in the [user files] are surely sequels, telling new (though somewhat repetitive) tales of Duke’s fabulous adventures.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, the user files were “substantially similar” because they<em> functioned as sequels</em> to the video game itself—specifically the story and principal character of the game. If the user files had told a different story, with different characters, they would not be derivative works. For example, a company offering a Lord of the Rings game might include tools allowing a user to create their own character from scratch. If the user used the tool to create a hobbit, that character might be considered a derivative work. A unique character that was simply a 21<sup>st</sup> century human in jeans and a t-shirt, not so much.</p>
