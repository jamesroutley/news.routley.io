I was pretty surprised and happy, because I hadn&#39;t had much success with Google. But it turns out that <i>every single one of those references and links</i> are made up. The references don&#39;t exist and the links themselves appear to be cobbled together. The last link for example, takes you to a paper on &#34;Grain mixes for subgrade layers&#34; - the title in the url is irrelevant and only the number matters.</p><p>Googling for some of those authors throws up author pages with their publications, and it turns out they&#39;ve  never published papers with those titles! See for example, http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~pjc/publ/</p></div></div></div>
