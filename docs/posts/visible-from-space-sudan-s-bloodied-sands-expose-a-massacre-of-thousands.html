    <p>The hot sand around the Sudanese city of El Fasher is stained red with the blood of more than 2,000 massacred civilians.</p><p>The pools of blood are so thick, the piles of bodies so exposed, that the ethnic purge allegedly committed by Sudanese paramilitary rebels is visible from space.</p><p>Militia groups defending the city alongside the army alleged the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) rebel group “committed heinous crimes against innocent civilians” and said most of the dead were women, children and the elderly.</p><p>A video purported to show a child soldier murdering a grown man in cold blood. Another supposedly showed RSF fighters executing civilians moments after pretending to release them.</p><p>The total death toll could not immediately be confirmed, but satellite pictures taken <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/10/27/fall-of-darfurs-last-stronghold-raises-fears-of-massacres-i/">after the city fell over the weekend</a> following an 18-month siege showed evidence of mass killings.</p>

    <p>Analysis by the Yale School of Public Health Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), which has been tracking the siege using open source images and satellite imagery, found clusters of objects “consistent with the size of human bodies” and “reddish ground discolouration” thought to be either blood or disturbed soil.</p><p>Body-sized objects were found clustered around vehicles and along an RSF sand berm built around the city. There have been reports of civilians being shot as they tried to break out and flee.</p>

    <p>The lab said it had also found evidence of “door-to-door clearance operations”.</p><p>It concluded: “El Fasher appears to be in a systematic and intentional process of ethnic cleansing of... indigenous non-Arab communities through forced displacement and summary execution”.</p><p>More than a quarter of a million people had endured starvation and bombardment in the city, after taking refuge in what was <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/09/01/the-battle-for-darfur/">the last army stronghold in the vast Darfur region</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/10/28/sudan-genocide-double-standards/">Sudan’s two-and-a-half-year-long civil war</a> has rekindled ethnic bloodshed in the region, with RSF fighters accused of massacring black African groups to take their land.</p><p>The RSF is largely drawn from Arab militias and formed from the notorious Janjaweed, responsible for genocide and mass atrocities in Darfur 20 years ago.</p><p>The RSF capture of other enclaves, including El Geneina in 2023, led to ethnic massacres of thousands of people.</p>

    <p>Refugees and aid workers have been warning for 18 months that similar atrocities were likely if El Fasher fell.</p><p>Cameron Hudson, a former US National Security Council director for Africa, said: “We have seen what is unfolding in El Fasher before.</p><p>“It was two years ago in El Geneina and as the RSF took the city, it initiated a campaign of ethnic cleansing and genocide. It’s happening again and still we do nothing. Shame on them. Shame on us.”</p><p>Tens of thousands of people have fled El Fasher since it fell, many heading westwards for Tawila.</p><p>A video clip purported to show scores of people fleeing the city, clutching their belongings as RSF fighters shouted racial insults and beat them.</p><p>In another scene, several militants dressed in the RSF’s trademark brown uniforms and turbans were seen packed into a truck, chasing unarmed civilians as they ran for their lives.</p><p>Gunfire rang out as one fighter shouted “kill the Nuba”, a reference to Sudan’s black African tribes.</p>

    <p>Reports indicated that the RSF was deliberately forcing displaced civilians eastward into areas under its control, away from humanitarian hubs such as Tawila, where some international agencies were operating.</p><p>According to Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International, the RSF was preventing people from fleeing the town in other directions, specifically blocking movement south and west, and compelling them to move east, where there was no safety or access to aid.</p><p><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/yvette-cooper/">Yvette Cooper</a>, the Foreign Secretary, said: “We are witnessing a deeply disturbing pattern of abuses in El Fasher, including systematic killings, torture, and sexual violence.”</p><p>The UN Human Rights Office said it had received “multiple, alarming reports that the RSF are carrying out atrocities, including summary executions”.</p><p>Volker Türk, the UN human rights chief, said the risk of further large-scale, ethnically motivated violations and atrocities in El Fasher was “mounting by the day”.</p>

    <p>Sudan’s catastrophic civil war is well into its third year and the UN and aid agencies say the fighting has produced the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Rivalry between Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the de facto president, and Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, his deputy, flared into open fighting in April 2023.</p><p>Violence has forced 14 million to flee their homes and some estimates have put the death toll at as many as 150,000. The health system has collapsed and several parts of the country have been plunged into famine.</p><p>A UN fact-finding mission has accused both sides of committing an “appalling range of harrowing human rights violations and international crimes”, including mass rape, arbitrary arrests, and torture.</p><p>The rivals have turned to regional allies for help, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) accused of backing the RSF with supplies and mercenaries through Chad and Libya.</p><p>Sudan’s army has meanwhile reportedly been supported by Egypt, Russia and Iran.</p><p>The UAE strongly denies supporting either side and says it has been pushing for a ceasefire.</p><p>The country is part of the so-called Quad of nations, alongside the United States, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, leading efforts to find a negotiated peace.</p>
