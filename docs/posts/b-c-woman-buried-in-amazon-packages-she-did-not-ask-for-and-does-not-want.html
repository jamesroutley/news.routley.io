    <h1>B.C. woman buried in Amazon packages she did not ask for and does not want</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Almost every day, Anca Nitu comes home from work to find an Amazon package she did not order at her doorstep. </p><p dir="ltr">For the past two months, Nitu says she&#39;s received more than 50 parcels containing women&#39;s shoes at her home in Langley, B.C. They were sent by people across North America who intended to return them to the Amazon seller, with each box containing a return authorization slip to her address. </p><p dir="ltr">She says couriers have also abandoned packages on her porch, denying her the opportunity to refuse them. It has also resulted in more than $300 worth of Collect-on-Delivery (COD) customs charges from the United Parcel Service (UPS). The bills are mailed to her by the delivery company.</p><p dir="ltr">&#34;I start shaking when I see packages at my door,&#34; said Nitu, who says the stress has cost her sleep and her appetite. &#34;They keep coming and it just doesn&#39;t end.&#34; </p><p dir="ltr">While she has not determined an exact cause, Nitu suspects her residence is being used as a return address for sellers or third-party handlers to dump their unwanted products.</p><p dir="ltr">The Better Business Bureau (BBB) says it sounds like a vendor-return scheme, where sellers, usually from overseas countries like China or India, skirt shipping and warehouse fees by using a residence to ship their returned products. </p><p dir="ltr">Third-party sellers who use Amazon fulfilment centres are required to pay for picking and packing orders, shipping, handling and product returns. </p><p dir="ltr">If an Amazon customer wishes to return a product to a third-party seller, the BBB says a company might try to save money by choosing a private return address rather than having to pay the cost of shipping packages overseas or having them processed in fulfilment centres. </p><p dir="ltr">When a seller&#39;s returned products can&#39;t be re-sold, the companies are charged with <a href="https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/external/GZ5Q2VW5WF4JWRGC?amp%3Bref=efph_GZ5Q2VW5WF4JWRGC_cont_G201411300&amp;locale=en-US" target="_blank">removal and disposal order fees</a>. </p><p><strong><em>WATCH | Woman says her address is being used as dumping ground for unwanted purchases:</em> </strong><span><span><div><div title="B.C. woman bombarded with Amazon packages she never ordered" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div title="B.C. woman bombarded with Amazon packages she never ordered"><div><p><img srcset="

I tried to explain the situation and they were not nice, let&#39;s put it that way.&#34;</p><p dir="ltr">UPS told CBC they intend to investigate the issue but do not wish to give an official comment until they&#39;ve contacted Nitu.</p><p dir="ltr">The BBB says it is facilitating correspondence between Nitu and UPS&#39;s corporate office.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>WATCH | Fashion giants slap fees on returning online purchases:</strong></em> </p><p><span><div><div title="Some retailers begin charging for online returns" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div title="Some retailers begin charging for online returns"><div><p><img srcset="
