        <p><a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/robins-tools/pixel-pump/updates/ready-for-shipping" target="_blank">The Pixel Pump</a> is an open source manual pick &amp; place assist tool by [Robin Reiter], and after a long road to completion, it’s ready to ship. We first saw the <a href="https://hackaday.com/2021/10/01/pixel-pump-pick-place-positions-parts-precisely/">Pixel Pump project as an entry to the 2021 Hackaday Prize</a> and liked the clean design and the concept of a completely open architecture for a tool that is so valuable to desktop assembly. It’s not easy getting hardware off the ground, but it’s now over the finish line and nearly everything — from assembly to packaging — has been done in-house.</p>

<p>Because having parts organized and available is every bit as important as the tool itself, a useful-looking companion item for the Pixel Pump is the SMD-Magazine. This is a container for parts that come on SMD tape rolls. These hold components at an optimal angle for use with the pickup tool, and can be fixed together on a rail to create project-specific part groups.</p>
<p>A tool being open source means giving folks a way to modify or add features for better workflows, and an example of this is [Robin]’s suggestion of using a foot pedal for hands-free control of the <a href="https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom" target="_blank">interactive BoM plugin</a>. With it, one can simply use a foot pedal to step through a highlighted list of every part for a design, an invaluable visual aid when doing hand assembly.</p>
<p>The Pixel Pump looks great, but if you’d prefer to go the DIY route for vacuum pickup tools you would certainly be in good company. We’ve seen <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/11/17/a-diy-vacuum-pickup-tool-for-75/">economical systems</a> built for under $100, and <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/01/14/daves-not-just-a-member-of-the-air-club-for-tweezers/">systems built around leveraging bead-handling tools</a> intended for hobbyists. On the extreme end there’s the minimalist approach of <a href="https://hackaday.com/2022/09/18/a-vacuum-pick-up-tool-for-not-a-lot/">building a tool directly around a small electric vacuum pump</a>.</p>
