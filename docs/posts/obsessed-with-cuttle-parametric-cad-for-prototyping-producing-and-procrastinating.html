<p>One of my primary creative outlets this year has been playing with
the CNC laser cutter<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> at my library’s makerspace. It is
the first CNC (“computer numerical control”, i.e.,
computer-programmable) shop tool I’ve gotten comfortable and fluent
with: while I’ve worked informally with plenty of <em>manual</em> shop
tools for wood and metal, I’ve never previously bridged that
programming/shop divide.<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> Unsurprisingly, it is SO. MUCH.
FUN.</p>

</figure>
<p>There is a vast and inspiring community of makers who share their
laser cutter designs and knowledge online. I used some of these
pre-existing projects to get comfortable with the machine, and then
wanted to move on to designing my own projects—both fully from scratch
and by iterating on projects I’ve seen someone else create. To do that,
I found <a href="http://cuttle.xyz">Cuttle</a>.</p>
<p>Cuttle is a web-based 2D parametric computer-aided design (CAD) tool.
It is easy to learn, has a full-featured free tier, and—most
importantly—it Just Works™. It has a clean and usable interface (not a
given with CAD!), several high-quality tutorials for getting started,
and a bunch of project templates of varying degrees of complexity, which
serve as both a teaching tool (“how was this piece constructed? look at
the internals to figure it out!”) and a starting point for customization
(it is trivially easy to clone an existing project and modify it
yourself). While it includes many built-in components and modifiers, it
also supports custom JavaScript code. This means that it is both easy
for non-programmers to use, and extensible by folks who want additional
customization.</p>
<p>In short, Cuttle is a powerful design system with an exceptionally
shallow learning curve, a commendable set of tutorials and pre-existing
templates, and an active and welcoming <a href="https://cuttle.xyz/discord">community</a> in which its developers
actively participate.</p>
<p>Also, now I’m addicted to it.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-cad-thee-let-me-count-the-ways">How do I CAD thee? Let
me count the ways</h2>
<p>There are several types of activity for which I’ve turned to
Cuttle:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Creation of physical laser-cutter objects.</strong> This
is the most straight-forward situation, and why I started using Cuttle
in the first place: I have a set of shapes that I need to be able to cut
with the laser cutter, in service of building a physical object. I build
them in Cuttle, export them as SVG files, and then import and print them
from the laser cutter.</p>
<p>Examples (illustrated in the following section): <a href="#bookends">decorative bookends</a>, <a href="#doorbell-chime-cover">a doorbell chime cover</a>, and assorted <a href="#a-handful-of-calibration-tools">calibration tools</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exploration of arbitrary
patterns/shapes/concepts.</strong> This situation is a natural result of
Cuttle being fun to play with. When I see an interesting shape or
pattern, I now think “hrm, how might I construct that?” and then I give
it a try. Notably, instead of hard-coding specific dimensions or
qualities of the item (number of sides, number of repeats, sizes of
angles, etc), I attempt to parameterize them in different ways: instead
of making a 6-sized shape, I’ll make an <code>n</code>-sided shape and
set <code>n</code> as a Cuttle variable. Then, once I have successfully
completed the original item, I can play with those parameters to see
what other interesting shapes or designs fall out. (In case it doesn’t
go without saying, there is no one way to parameterize a design! Therein
lies the <del>madness</del> creativity.)</p>
<p>Examples: <a href="#pattern-studies">assorted pattern studies</a>, <a href="#a-poem">poem</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Non-CAD prototyping.</strong> These situations have come
about because when I am having fun in CAD software, every problem looks
like it can be solved with CAD. Instead of defaulting to other more
familiar-to-me programming paradigms/languages/environments when working
on these projects, I used Cuttle for the prototype stage.</p>
<p>Examples: <a href="#punch-cards-for-music-boxes">music box punch
cards</a>, <a href="#weaving-cartoon">weaving cartoon</a>, <a href="#animating-parallax">parallax animation</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="show-dont-tell">Show, don’t tell</h2>
<p>The following are an un-ordered selection of projects I’ve designed
myself—or in a couple cases, have significantly modified from someone
else’s initial design.<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> I encourage you to go to at least
one of the associated project pages and play around with any parameters
that are visible; you can’t possibly break anything, and it’s really
fun.</p>
<h3 id="bookends">Bookends</h3>
<p><em>Play with this project <a href="https://cuttle.xyz/@hannahilea/Bookends-eBHfPdCNGTIH">here</a>!</em></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/bookends.png" alt="Side by side photos of a set of books being held up by a bookend, each decorated differently with engraved book icons"/>


</figure>
<p>These decorative bookends were designed as a gift. There are two
aspects of this project I’m especially proud of. First, the initial
conception of “faceplate designed to attach (with magnets) to cheap
metal bookends,” including correctly managing registration (i.e.,
alignment of the piece) during printing, to engrave both front and
back.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/book-back.png" alt="Photo of the back of a flat bookend, with magnets glued on to attach it to the underlying metal bookend"/>


</figure>
<p>Second, I’m pleased with the specific book icon I designed. The book
icon is parameterized on number of pages, page and cover thickness, and
open angle:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/book-icon.gif" alt="Animated image of a line drawing of an open book, with the line dimensions shifting and the book opening"/>


</figure>
<p>You can see that the bookends each play with that design in a
different way—note the changing number of pages for the left design, and
the degrees of openness of each book on the right.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/chimes.jpg" alt="Photo and zoomed in photo of a decorated wood box hanging on a wall with doorbell chimes sticking out the bottom"/>


</figure>
<p>I designed this decorative doorbell cover for my parents, to replace
an original doorbell chime cover that they didn’t like. I started from a
basic <a href="https://cuttle.xyz/@cuttle/Open-Box-with-Finger-Joints-D2ugGEvYUNfd">Cuttle
box template</a>, and then added a design to the sides, a decorated
front plate, and a cutout on the bottom for the chimes.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/chime-layout.png" alt="CAD rendering of the sides of a decorated box"/>


</figure>
<p>It took me a while to build this, as I did a lot of angsting over how
to decorate it—the only project requirement was that the size and bottom
cutout matched the original, so that it would fit. Eventually I got
unstuck by building a single little snowflake pattern unit and then
playing around with with repeating and incrementally scaling a couple
parameters until it felt visually pleasing.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>I also had to cut a bunch of test pieces to see how thin I could get
the lines on the decorative cutouts before they were too thin for the
laser to handle.</p>

<p><em>Play with this project <a href="https://cuttle.xyz/@hannahilea/Music-box-punchcards-iTT4lnLVNL5f">here</a>!</em></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/music-1.png" alt="Photo of a mechanical music box, loaded to play a strip of paper with holes punched into it"/>


</figure>
<p>This was a project I’ve wanted to do for a long time: automatically
generate and cut the music rolls played by a mechanical music box. I’m
planning to document this project with its own write-up, so am
intentionally skimping on details here.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/music-design.png" alt="Screencapture of a CAD drawing of a long rectangular shape with holes cut out."/>


</figure>
<p>These music box rolls are an example of using Cuttle to prototype:
rather than building out an end-to-end MIDI-to-SVG pipeline
(<code>midi2svg</code>!), I instead converted MIDI to note index
coordinates in an external Julia script, and then plugged the output
coordinates of that script into a Cuttle template. This allowed me to
spend my development time easily tweaking print parameters (hole
spacing, metadata engraving, roll pagination, etc) with immediate visual
feedback. When I turn it into an end-to-end system in the future, I
won’t include Cuttle in the pipeline, and I knew that from the start,
but it still made the development process easier and faster for me than
it would have been otherwise.</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/yoto.png" alt="Photo of a rainbox-painted flat rectangle with parallel cut lines in it that are displaying cards"/>


</figure>
<p>My young niblings have a <a href="https://us.yotoplay.com/yoto-mini">Yoto</a> player, along with a
collection of various story and music cards; I made this card holder for
them so that they could see their entire library at a glance.<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> (A Yoto player is a small portable
music box for kids; specific playlists are triggered by inserting a
corresponding card.) While I CADed this myself, I modeled it off of card
holders I saw elsewhere on the internet, and made it customizable for
the number of cards in a collection.</p>
<p>The aspect of this project that I was most excited about was the
color: I cut the piece from Glowforge Draftboard—a medium-density
fiberboard material—and then painted it with watercolor paint (!) and
sealed it.</p>
<p>The aspect of this project that the recipient was most excited about
was that the truck design was one that he specifically likes to color in
during quiet time, when printed at a slightly larger scale.</p>

</figure>
<p>Most of these were in support of some other project, either public or
non, for learning how to appropriately tune the laser cutter across
different materials. You can see the ones where I thought I was
engraving words but was actually cutting all the way through the
material (whoops!), and also the ones where I scrawled on them to be
able to later map back to various print settings.</p>

</figure>
<p>My mom is a weaver; she asked me to make a “weaving cartoon” (i.e., a
mock-up) in service of potentially weaving a site-specific piece. (What
she requested was a very basic hacky photoshop collage…instead I had
some fun in Cuttle. Overkill!)</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/pattern-moire.gif" alt="Animated image of two overlaid grids shifting to cause moire patterns"/>


</figure>
<p>Pattern studies are how I “let” myself procrastinate these days. I
<em>could</em> respond to that email…or I could see how quickly I can
implement a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern">moiré
pattern</a>. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I didn’t previously do this type of pattern
playing, except <em>maybe</em> via the occasional doodle. Now I do it
regularly, and it scratches the dual creativity itches of “constrained
problem solving” followed by “open-ended exploration and search for
visually interesting results”. (Translation: Making pretty pictures is
fun.)</p>
<p>The approach is basic: I see a pattern I think is cool and then I
have a go at CADding it.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/pattern-lamp.png" alt="Side-by-side photo of a pattern punched into brass and the same pattern rended as a CAD drawing"/>


</figure>
<p>Once you start thinking in CAD components, it is very hard to
stop—but it does make the world more interesting at large! Hard to be
bored if you can instead be thinking through how you’d replicate the
design of the wallpaper/that building across the street/the figure you
saw in a scientific paper/etc.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/pattern-domokos.png" alt="Side-by-side figure with multiple repeating patterns and those same patterns reproduced in CAD"/>


</figure>
<p>I was sick for a week mid-summer,<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and while I was both
low-energy and going stir-crazy, I ended up sketching up some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumiko_(woodworking)">kumiko</a>
patterns to keep myself amused:</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/pattern-kumiko.png" alt="Side-by-side photo of a zoomed in wooden kumiko pattern and the same pattern rended as a CAD drawing"/>


</figure>
<p>After the initial pattern recreation, I love seeing the additional
patterns that fall out of tweaking various angles and ratios. For
example, here’s a close-up of one of the kumiko patterns:</p>

</figure>
<p>And that same pattern, after scaling some of the parameters to
various degrees: <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/pattern-kumiko2.png" alt="CAD of kumiko pattern progressively shifting"/></p>
<p>And an alternate set of variations: <img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/pattern-kumiko3.png" alt="CAD of kumiko pattern shifting in another way"/></p>

</figure>
<p>I wanted to test out a basic animation with parallax, in service of a
future flip book-type application. It worked! Onward to images that take
longer than 3 minutes to draw…</p>

<h3 id="a-poem">A poem!</h3>
<p><em>Play with this project <a href="https://cuttle.xyz/@hannahilea/RC-CC-Everybody-has-a-hungry-heart-pqGODlplgbMg">here</a>!</em></p>
<figure>
<img src="https://hannahilea.com/blog/assets/hungry-bodies.gif" alt="Animated image of a stack of roughly human-shaped outlines containing heart outlines, with the outlines becoming progressively more jumbled"/>


</figure>
<p>Last but not least, the most off-label task I’ve used Cuttle for thus
far: a poem. I made this as a creative coding exercise while at the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a>. During the weekly
creative coding session, attendees have ~1.5 hours to build something
based on a prompt received at the start of the session (anything, in any
programming language or paradigm!). The week’s prompt had been
“Everybody has a hungry heart,” so I approached it by way of a very
basic custom modifier in Cuttle.</p>
<p>I’m actually really pleased with how this one turned out, and it
makes me want to do more interactive poem-type pieces in the future. I
encourage you to make your own Cuttle poem—it doesn’t have to be fancy!
If you do, please share it with me.<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>
***
</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>And that’s all that’s worth sharing for now! The amount of time it
took to make any of these depended strongly on the complexity of the
pattern, my familiarity with the various tools at the point I made it,
and how much time I spent strategizing ahead of time. Some of the
projects here took days (the music box rolls, the doorbell chime box,
etc) while others were much faster. The moiré pattern took ~15 minutes,
if that.</p>
<p>Cuttle isn’t without flaws—but also, it is relatively new software,
and is under active and responsive development. So far I’ve been able to
design around any limitations I’ve encountered.<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> The
biggest problem with Cuttle is that it is fun. Too fun. Too easy to say
“oh, let me just try one more thing…” and then come up for air to find
that it is 1am. 🙃</p>
