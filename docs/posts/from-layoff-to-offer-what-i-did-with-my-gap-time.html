    <h1>From Layoff to Offer: What I Did With My Gap Time</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>In January, my entire team was laid off at NZXT. I had the option to stay longer, but I chose to take a package. Thanks to 5+ weeks of banked PTO and 6+ years of service, I was fortunate to have time to figure out my next steps. I know this kind of time is a luxury, so I tried to make the most of it.</p>
<p>I had already decided to move from engineering management back into an individual contributor role, but boy did that mean I had my work cut out for me. I was throwing my hat into a <a href="https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/the-reality-of-tech-interviews">historically tough engineering job market</a> while making the lateral switch back to an individual contributor after 4 years of not coding as an engineering manager. When I eventually started applying to companies, recruiters frequently wanted to confirm that I had meant to apply for an IC role.</p>

<p>Looking back, I can categorize my time in two distinct buckets.</p>
<h2 id="i-spent-time-having-fun">I spent time having fun</h2>
<p>I jumped into adjacent domains I wanted to dive deeper into. I jumped into new domains I knew little about. I reached flow state and worked late into the night on building or writing. I rediscovered the joy and sense of adventure that comes with programming - understanding a system enough to hypothesize improvements and <a href="https://sitongpeng.com/writing/backend-challenges-when-building-a-web-based-network-game">implement those with great success</a>. I even tackled capture-the-flag-style interview problems just for fun, knowing they likely wouldn‚Äôt lead to an interview. Ramp had a particularly <a href="https://tns4lpgmziiypnxxzel5ss5nyu0nftol.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/ramp-challenge-instructions/">fun challenge</a> to decode a message buried in a noisy DOM tree, and completing that did indeed not result in an interview.</p>
<p>I fully remade my personal website. I wrote technical posts about what I was learning. One of those <a href="">posts</a> even made the front page of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1l1nh6j/websockets_guarantee_order_so_why_are_my_messages/">r/programming</a> with almost 100 upvotes!</p>

<span><em>It was actually terrifying to see this many people visiting my website</em></span></p>
<h2 id="i-spent-time-being-uncomfortable">I spent time being uncomfortable</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs news to no one that interviewing has been incredibly stressful and full of humbling setbacks. I kept myself going by focusing on consistent improvement, understanding progress is not linear, and repeating to myself that ‚Äúnot knowing something‚Äù is a temporary state. However, along with giving myself grace, I was brutally honest with myself about where I was falling short. I kept a ledger of interview failures and focused on fixing my understanding to avoid repeating the same mistakes. I threw any knowledge I needed to retain into spaced repetition Anki flashcards and quizzed myself on subway rides. I tracked every LeetCode problem I‚Äôve done, revisiting problems I had trouble with until I solved them - then again, until I solved them in under 15 minutes. I spent hours verbally talking (not chatting) to AI tools about system design until I could confidently explain how contention issues might make optimistic concurrency control a poor fit or quickly suggest <a href="https://sitongpeng.com/writing/when-does-it-make-sense-to-use-a-database-constraint">different database indexes to improve read performance</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://sitongpeng.com/media/dsa.png" alt="Solving problems multiple times"/>
<span><em>Some problems I‚Äôd return to many times.</em></span></p>

<p>Toward the end of my interview cycle, I was confidently passing all of my technical rounds. I would sometimes finish DSA rounds early - I once had 30 minutes to spare that I spent going deep on the role &amp; team. System design interviewers would give me feedback like ‚Äúthat was fun‚Äù or ‚Äúthis is basically what we have in production‚Äù.</p>
<p>In the end, I was fortunate to receive two strong offers - enough for me to stop interviewing. The first offer I earned from my time being uncomfortable, by showing a depth of experience and understanding that proved I could be successful in the role and beyond. The second offer I earned from time having fun, by doing actual work on real-time services that were directly relevant to this team. Significant portions of my interview loop were spent discussing the ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of my relevant personal projects.</p>
<h2 id="i-had-a-lot-of-help">I had a lot of help</h2>
<p>I have a number of people I want to thank. A lot of folks gave referrals that often opened doors for me. While I didn‚Äôt convert these to offers (thankfully most loops got to onsites üòÆ‚Äçüí®), all of these experiences helped make me stronger.</p>
<p>Oscar - for sending me a job listing that I got an offer for!</p>
<p>Zameer and Joe - a simple referral would have been plenty but you guys also pushed hard for me internally, for that I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Lauren, Jee, Recurse Center (Laura, Sonali), Yujin, Jennifer, Megan, Zach, Lisa, Christian, Connie, Aldrich, Krishanu, Dom, Chen - for believing in me enough to put your name on a referral (or offer to). And some of you multiple times üôè!</p>
<p>My parents, James, Amber, Lauren, Christian, George, Rui, Julia - for helping me weigh my offers or listening to me process setbacks along the way.</p>
<p>Thank you all ‚Äî I‚Äôm certain none of this would have happened without your support. I owe each of you a drink üòâ.</p>  </div></div>
