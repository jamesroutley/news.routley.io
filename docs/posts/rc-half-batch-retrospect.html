    <h1>RC Half-batch Retrospect</h1>

    <p>Since I&#39;ve been lazy and not written update for RC Week 5 and 6, I
    decided to ease the burden and roll them both into a half-batch retrospect
    instead so that I can bring myself to actually write it and reduce
    friction-to-write.</p>
    <div id="outline-container-morning-me-is-very-ambitious">
      <h2 id="morning-me-is-very-ambitious"><a href="#morning-me-is-very-ambitious">Morning me is very ambitious</a></h2>
      <p>When I plan my days I have a lot of tasks that I would like to get
        finished, alas, at the end of the day, most of these tasks remain
        unfinished. I need to be more realistic. Additionally, I should do some
        meta-planning where I use certain days for certain related tasks
        instead of having many unrelated tasks (e.g. mixing admin with writing
        code and reading papers). This is something that I continue to work
        on.</p>

      <h2 id="reflecting-on-inperson-reflection"><a href="#reflecting-on-inperson-reflection">Reflecting on in-person
      reflection</a></h2>
      <p>I had a chat with some of the RC admin about how it has gone so far.
        It was super chill but very insightful. While some things have not gone
        as I wanted (does anything ever go according to plan? Don&#39;t think so!)
        it was reassuring to get some outside point of views which also
        highlighted what I did accomplish, like setting up this website and the
        more meta-skills of building volitional muscles etc.</p>

      <h2 id="finished-setting-up-my-workstation"><a href="#finished-setting-up-my-workstation">Finished setting up my
      workstation</a></h2>
      <p>I managed to get my workstation set up properly. Now I have a beefy
        gpu which I can use on-demand from my laptop. I also went a bit crazy
        and set up a VPN so that I can use jupyter together with emacs. For
        this I relied a lot on <a href="https://martibosch.github.io/jupyter-emacs-universe/">this blog post
        on emacs and jupyter</a> which saved me many hours. I found the
        <a href="https://github.com/astoff/code-cells.el">code-cells</a> emacs
        package to be very well-engineered and striking a good balance between
        light-weight and feature complete.</p>
