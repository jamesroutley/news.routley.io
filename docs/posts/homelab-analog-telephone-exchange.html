<h2>Summary</h2>
<i>An introduction to my MCU based fully featured analog telephone exchange, how I mounted it in my home lab powered with batteries for months of use &#34;off-grid&#34;, and how I set up a tiny telephone network.</i></td></tr></tbody></table>
<h2>Motivation</h2>

A few years ago, an analog phone exchange would probably be one of the last things I thought I would build.

However, last year I decided to dig into the old POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) standard, search Finn (the norwegian equivalent to Craigslist) for old phones and start designing a phone exchange.

Why on earth would I do this?

<ul>
	<li>I love working with old communication protocols and standards. Imagine reading a well defined standard from a yellow stained paper written in the 1970&#39;s, while you are writing firmware for a modern MCU.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>My daughter is really into toy telephones, so what wouldn&#39;t be cooler than mounting a proper phone in her room and enabling her to call us and her grand parents?</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>We have an unused CAT6 cable between our house and my parents house, as well as a lot of CAT6 wiring in our (pretty new) house, so all the cables are already in place.</li>
</ul>
