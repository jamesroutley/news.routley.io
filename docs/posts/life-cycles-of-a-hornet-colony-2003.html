of warm April days marks
the emergence of the new queens, born and mated the previous autumn. They survive the
harsh winter in rotten wood or the soil, their metabolism slowed down to a
minimum. They also produce Glycerol, which acts as an antifreeze! After emerging their first task is to
undertake investigation flights to find a suitable nesting-place and food in the form of
tree sap and insects.</SPAN></p>

water, carbohydrate-rich juices, and proteins in the form of insect prey, is not shared with other female workers in the nest. The foragers continue to process
it and then add the building material to the nest structure themselves. A freshly emerged female worker (who does not go on foraging trips yet) can not,
therefore, do construction work at the nest for this period.</SPAN></p>

<p> <i><b><SPAN color="#FF0066" size="3">A</SPAN></b></i><SPAN size="2">fter five to ten female workers have emerged, the queen starts to fly from the nest less and less, with the workers taking over the role of foraging. Workers are noticeably smaller (18-25mm) than
the queen (35mm), and only live for three to four weeks. Eventually the queen becomes nest bound and will never
leave the nest again. With queen safely hidden in the nest, the most
dangerous time for the colony has now passed. The queen now focuses solely
on reproduction, the function she will perform until her demise at the
end of the season.</SPAN></p>

crash against window panes sometimes scaring the people inside. By turning out the light the however they are able to rapidly reorientate and will move on. Hornets are capable of
flying with light intensity of 0,01 Lux, at which the human eye is completely useless.</SPAN></p>

temperature through evaporative cooling. After completing the first comb a new pedicel is built to allow construction of a new tier. Construction occurs basically downwards from
the first comb, with additional lateral expansion of each comb and the paper.</SPAN></p>

fences, buildings, telephone poles, and other sources. They mix this with saliva and chew it up into a ball with
their mandibles (mouth parts). This makes the wood fiber extremely soft and moist. After a period of chewing, the hornet adds the paste to the nest
structure and spreads it out with her mandibles and legs. After it thoroughly dries; a type of tough, durable paper is formed.</SPAN></p>

settle in the spring in bird nest-boxes, although these rarely offer enough space for a
mature hornet colony. By the early summer, with 25 to 30 workers and three to four combs
such boxes are full. Thus the only possibility is to build outside the box or look
elsewhere. In the latter case, workers fly out to search for suitable sites in the
neighbouring area. If successful, some female workers fly with the queen to a
new, larger cavity where a new secondary nest is established.</SPAN></p>
<p><SPAN color="#FF0066" size="2"><b>This process is called

old nest tending for both. The brood in the old nest are raised to adulthood while the construction of the new nest is underway. Eventually all the hornets move to the new
secondary nest and the old nest becomes disused. How exactly the hornets are able to direct each other to the new nest site remains a mystery, although chemical signals are
probably used.</SPAN></p>
