    <h1>How to advertise to developers: deep dive into paid developer marketing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Advertising to developers feels like asking for trouble. And it is. </p><p>Most developers hate advertising, especially if it is done in a &#34;traditional&#34; way. Pushy pop-ups, &#34;do it now&#34;, flashy colors, and all that stuff. </p><p>Some marketers would even go as far as to say that <a target="_blank" href="https://hackernoon.com/marketing-to-developers-via-facebook-ads-the-right-strategies-and-approach-lw4934w3">you shouldn&#39;t use paid ads to market to developers at all</a>. Why? </p><p>Developer audience is both diverse and complex but devs do share some specific characteristics important in the context of ads like: </p><ul role="list"><li>allergic to “marketing” and advertising</li><li>skeptic by nature</li><li>pragmatic and practical </li><li>tribal, they only really believe other devs when it comes to tech</li></ul><blockquote><em>“So they don’t like ads, don’t believe them, and they discard things that are not obviously valuable to them right now? Cool. Let’s run some Instagram carousels and wait for signups!“</em> </blockquote><p>Ok, but does it mean you shouldn&#39;t run ads? </p><p>Not really. There is hope :). </p><p>You should just proceed with caution. I have gone through more budget than I am willing to admit trying to get paid channel work for us. Some of it worked some of it failed miserably. </p><p>In this article I’ll dive into:</p><ul role="list"><li>core components of paid ads </li><li>paid channels that you can try</li><li>dev advertising principles</li><li>examples of great developer-focused paid ads campaigns </li></ul><p>Some of the things you’ll read about I tried myself. </p><p>Either way, I hope that after reading this article you’ll spend your paid advertising dollars smarter. </p><p>Okay, so what do you need to run paid ads to devs successfully? </p><h2>Components of paid developer marketing</h2><p>There are four parts of every paid ad campaign: <br/></p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Goal</strong>: what do you want those people to do </li><li><strong>Targeting</strong>: where and who you want to show your ads to </li><li><strong>Creative</strong>: what you want to show them </li><li><strong>Landing page</strong>: where they go after clicking your ad </li></ul><p>With developers, without a decent baseline for each of those things, your campaigns will flop. There will be nothing to optimize. </p><p>So let’s dive into each of them and get you to that decent baseline.</p><h2>Campaign goal</h2><p>Ok, let’s start with the reason you are doing this. </p><p>Most of the time you want signups for your developer tool or leads for your bigger platform. But there are a few other potential <a target="_blank" href="https://www.moesif.com/blog/developer-marketing/paid-ads/Best-Practices-for-Paid-Marketing-To-Developers/">dev-focused ad campaign goals</a>: </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Brand exposure:</strong> you want people to see what you do so that when they have a problem they will think about you. Remember that the vast majority of your ideal developers are not in the market to buy your dev tool today. That is why you should <a target="_blank" href="https://www.notion.so/article/branding-developer-tools">invest in branding to grow demand</a> for the future </li><li><strong>Activation:</strong> you want people who have signed up to start using your tool </li><li><strong>Engagement</strong>: you want people who use your tool to use it more often </li><li><strong>Upgrade: </strong>you want free users of your tool to upgrade to paid plans </li><li><strong>Signups</strong> (obviously): you want people who have the need for your tool to buy/signup right now </li></ul><p>Also, if you are running a paid ads program, it is not either-or. </p><p>For example.</p><p><a href="https://circleci.com/" target="_blank">CircleCi</a> is (or was) remarketing with youtube pre-roll video ads with case study testimonials to users who visited the page but haven’t signed up.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/62286bccf1b3f226ad450a0d_CircleCI%20ad%20flow.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>CircleCI remarketing ad flow for high intent pages</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/" target="_blank">Datadog</a> is (or was) running video ads on Facebook to users who signed up presenting new (and old) features which I am sure impacts activation and engagement.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/62286e0709439536a4178404_Datadog%20ad%20flow.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Datadog ad campaing for signed up users (and cold)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/" target="_blank">Elastic</a> is (or was) running Google search ads for kewyord &#34;search engine&#34; for brand awareness and market education. </p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/622872d34a9b9080a08f9c76_Elastic%20ad%20flow.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Elastic google search ad flow. </figcaption></figure><p>So, if you have a problem with conversion at a particular point in your funnel you can try to use ads to improve it.</p><h2>Ad Targeting</h2><p>Targetting is choosing where you want to show your ads and who should see them.</p><p><strong>Where</strong> is about which platform (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Youtube).</p><p>Which should you choose?</p><p>The easiest way to find out is to ask your users/customers.</p><p>If they don’t spend time on Instagram, or they only go there to look at food pictures you should probably not run your ads there.</p><p>Imagine seeing an ad for a CICD tool in two places:</p><ul role="list"><li>a banner on <a target="_blank" href="http://forbes.com">forbes.com</a></li><li>an in-feed post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/" target="_blank">reddit.com/r/devops/</a></li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/622877d27f00f04050858c8a_Where%20is%20the%20ad%20displayed%20(1).png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>In-context vs out-of-context ad position</figcaption></figure><p>The same dev is more likely to click on your ad while scrolling through some interesting DevOps discussions on that subreddit than reading about a market crash on the Forbes website. </p><p>The only exception to that could be remarketing to people who have already visited your page or signed up for your tool.</p><p>Now, <strong>who</strong> do you want to show your ads to?</p><p>Depending on a platform you can get:</p><ul role="list"><li>countries and cities</li><li>age</li><li>interests</li><li>education level</li><li>industry</li></ul><p>But <a target="_blank" href="https://www.moesif.com/blog/developer-marketing/paid-ads/Best-Practices-for-Paid-Marketing-To-Developers/">targetting developers is extra hard</a> because developers are not just “interested in tech” or working in “software companies” or have “computer science degree”.</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>tech stack</strong>: language, frameworks, libraries, tools</li><li><strong>role</strong>: front end vs back-end vs DevOps vs security vs machine learning engineer</li><li><strong>context</strong>: enterprise vs startup vs software house vs freelancer vs hobbyist</li><li><strong>seniority</strong>: junior vs regular vs senior vs principal vs architect</li></ul><p>No platform gives you all that. Even on Linkedin which seems to have all of this data you won&#39;t get perfect targeting. </p><ul role="list"><li>they want to boost their profiles</li><li>they worked with them (years) before</li><li>they feel that they should have them look professional but don&#39;t really know those technologies</li></ul><p>What happens when your targeting is off?</p><p>In theory, you could make your ad more general so that those back-end devs talk to your DevOps people, or designers talk to front-end engineers. </p><p>To maximize your chances you should get in front of your ideal customer profile devs and tell them something relevant and useful right now.</p><p>Anyway, the good thing is that most platforms give you something you can work with:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Reddit</strong> - find subreddits where your devs are</li><li><strong>Twitter</strong> - find Twitter handles of people who talk to your devs and keywords they interacted with</li><li><strong>Youtube</strong> - find channels your devs watch</li><li><strong>Linkedin</strong> - find your devs by role/seniority/languages</li></ul><p>And there is of course <strong>retargeting</strong> with two flavors:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Cookie</strong>: When a person visits a certain page on your website you give them a cookie. Later you can use that cookie to show relevant ads.</li><li><strong>Email</strong>: When a person signs up to your tool you can use the email from the signup to target that person (and similar people) on platforms like Google. BTW you probably need a lot of emails to make this one work. From my experience, 2000 emails of ideal profiles was not enough because the match with the Google database was really low.</li></ul><p>I personally think that <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/third-party-cookie-phase-out" target="_blank">retargeting will go away</a> with constantly updating regulations regarding privacy. </p><p>Ok, but even with perfect targeting you still need to make your message practical and relevant to your audience.</p><h2>Ad Creative</h2><p>Creative is how you communicate your message through your ad.</p><p>I’d say there are two parts of the creative:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Ad format</strong>: in-feed, display banner, pop-up ad, ad carousel, pre-roll video</li><li><strong>Ad medium</strong>: the visual, text (copy), animation, or video.</li><li><strong>Actual creative</strong>: what words and visuals you use</li></ul><p><strong>Ad Format and medium</strong></p><p>As for the <a target="_blank" href="https://developermedia.com/developer-friendly-advertising/">format and medium, with devs, be as non-intrusive as you can</a> (while still catching attention):</p><ul role="list"><li>don’t do popups as they just piss people off</li><li>do static (vs dynamic) banners to make sure people don’t have to wait to see what the ad is about (unless you are running video, then it is ok)</li><li>do native, in-feed promoted content (but try to add value to the surrounding context)</li><li>do simple text and links, especially if you go for newsletters or blog sponsorships</li></ul><p>Thinking about first principles with devs, you should just try and <strong>make it as non-advertising as possible</strong> when it comes to the format. </p><p>Ok, so say you decided on a static, Reddit in-feed banner.</p><p>What should go into your ad?</p><h3><strong>Ad creative basics</strong></h3><p>Conventional marketing knowledge would say things like:</p><ul role="list"><li>catch attention</li><li>be clever, snappy with your copy</li><li>talk values, not features</li></ul><p>It could work. </p><p>For devs, the most important thing is that the ad is relevant to their problem right now. </p><p>Btw I think this is exactly what good marketing is about anyway. </p><p>Back to the ads. </p><p>Remember the first principles:</p><ul role="list"><li>devs don’t want it to read like an ad (<strong>hate advertising</strong>)</li><li>devs want the ad to be relevant (<strong>practical and pragmatic</strong>)</li><li>devs don’t believe to good to be true statements (<strong>skeptical</strong>)</li><li>devs want to buy from other devs (<strong>expertise</strong>)</li></ul><h3><strong>Ad relevancy</strong></h3><p>While it is good to be clever and snappy, it is crucial to be relevant and practical.</p><p>To be relevant, you may need to <strong>use technical jargon</strong> that only some of the devs will understand.</p><p>I am not talking about other marketers not understanding what you are talking about. </p><p>So don’t be afraid to <strong>get technical and explicit.</strong></p><p>Throw in technology names or feature names that most people don’t understand. </p><p>It makes your ad more relevant to your target devs. </p><p>That is ok.</p><p>You want to get in front of the right people with the right message. </p><p>An additional benefit of <strong>using jargon is that you signal your expertise. </strong>At some point, it may almost feel like it is not an ad, and the person writing it actually knows what they are talking about. </p><p>Make the ad so relevant to your target audience they just have to stop and read.</p><p>Now, how do you get practical?</p><h3><strong>Ad practicality</strong></h3><p>Talk about features, not values.</p><p>Say “5ms video load time” instead of “better videos quicker”.</p><p>This is the absolute opposite of what a classic marketing textbook would tell you.</p><p>But is it really?</p><p>Think about this:</p><ul role="list"><li>you filtered out people with good targeting</li><li>you made the message so relevant it filters out most of the people.</li></ul><p>Who is left?</p><p>People who already know the value. </p><p>And they want you to be specific so that they can quickly figure out whether your product will solve their problems today.</p><p>I really like this example from <a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflowsolutions.com/topic/developer-influence/create-effective-banner-ads">StackOverflow article on ads:</a></p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/620d196086a938727bcc0f0c_swipefile-3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption><a

target="_blank">https://stackoverflowsolutions.com/topic/developer-influence/create-effective-banner-ads</a></figcaption></figure><p>Low on fluff, high on practical, relevant information.</p><p>You are an Android dev working with video?</p><p>Load time is probably something that you or one of your Android devs can have a problem with right now.</p><p>But if you talk about “better Android apps” I don’t even know what it means.</p><p>One more example, this time from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertiser-guide/">Ethical ads guidelines.</a></p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/620d1a863b1d5dee5a48eb96_swipefile-4.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption><a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertiser-guide/" target="_blank">https://www.ethicalads.io/advertiser-guide/</a></figcaption></figure><p>What is good about it:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Practical</strong> - Django, “generate sales reports”, screenshot with nice reports</li><li><strong>Relevant</strong> - Django, “e-commerce app”</li></ul><p>If I am a python dev working with SaaS tools, or a PHP dev working with e-commerce. </p><p>But if I am a python dev who is building e-commerce apps with Django, then sales reports could be top of mind. </p><p>One often-used ad creative targeted at people who are further down the funnel, somewhere at the consideration stage, is video retargeting case study blurbs.</p><ul role="list"><li>differences vs other tools (and link to comparison pages)</li><li>case studies of people/teams using your tool for a use case X (and link to a case study)</li><li>getting started and examples (and link to the

Where do I go?</p><h2>Landing page</h2><p>Once people click on your ad they go somewhere, right?</p><p>Many marketers choose this somewhere to be the homepage.</p><p>I think this is almost always not the best place to direct people.  </p><p>For example, say our tool “D” which does sales reports for Django e-commerce links to homepage:</p><ul role="list"><li>“D” is so cool that it not only does sales reports but also error monitoring and 5 other things important for e-commerce devs.</li><li>The company behind “D” has an awesome Django podcast that they talk about on their homepage</li><li>And they just raised a big round and hire like crazy, which they also talk about on the homepage</li><li>“D” works with 15 other Python frameworks for web dev</li><li>The homepage copy starts with the headline “Enterprise platform for e-commerce analytics”</li></ul><p>Our poor dev who wanted &#34;sales reports for Django apps&#34; is no longer sure if this tool is going to help (or if he landed on the correct website).</p><p>So if the homepage is not good, then what is?</p><p>That depends on the goal of the ad campaign and what you put on the ad copy. </p><p>The pages I saw people link to are:</p><ul role="list"><li>Classic landing page</li><li>Vertical/Role/Use case page</li><li>Blog post</li><li>Developer portal</li><li>Docs getting started</li><li>Landing page for getting started</li><li>vs {TOOL X} comparison</li><li>Case study</li><li>Team plan + case study mix</li><li>Captera or G2 profile (could work for google search campaigns for keywords like “YourTool + review”)</li></ul><p><strong>When to use which?</strong></p><p>That depends on the stage of awareness of your developer. </p><p>Say you see people do homepage -&gt; product -&gt; docs -&gt; pricing -&gt; signup.</p><p>Or you see people coming from Twitter -&gt; problem aware blog articles-&gt; product -&gt; signup</p><p>And there will often be many paths. You can have devs who would like to see case studies of other companies after they see the docs. </p><p>Let’s go through some of those.</p><h3><strong>Classic landing page (Datadog)</strong></h3><p>A classic approach is to craft a page specifically for the use case described in the ad.</p><p>For example, here Datadog is running Facebook ads for monitoring PHP performance and they have created a page about exactly that, monitoring PHP performance.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img

this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.datadoghq.com/dg/apm/php-application-performance/">PHP monitoring landing page</a> in more detail.</p><p>This is a classic where:</p><ul role="list"><li>The page doesn’t have the navbar so you focus your attention on this page only</li><li>Headline matches ad copy</li><li>Additional details with features and values</li><li>Supporting visual that helps present the values</li><li>Call to action (CTA)</li><li>A list of benefits presented in a format headling + details + visual</li><li>Social proof with some logos</li><li>One more Call to action</li></ul><p>There are many <a target="_blank" href="https://copyhackers.com/landing-page-optimization-webinar-posts-conversion-copywriting/">ways to optimize this landing page</a> based on qualitative and quantitative research but it is a solid baseline.</p><h3><strong>Developer portal (Algolia)</strong></h3><p>You can link to a developer portal like Algolia:</p><figure

you want to have something general but <a target="_blank" href="https://www.algolia.com/developers/get-started/">focused on devs getting starting like Algolia did</a> here:</p><figure

to. </p><h3><strong>Team plan + case study (Contentful)</strong></h3><p>An interesting approach is to run ads for the upgrade plan that are connected to the case study.</p><p>Basically, you talk about values that a team got from the plan but it is not a typical case study page.</p><p>The focus is on getting you to upgrade.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/620d64a0098a41f7005741ba_Ads%20dev%20marketing%20-%20ad%20to%20case%20study%20upgrade.png"

marketing channels</h2><p>Let me just be honest and say this.</p><blockquote><strong>Most of those things haven’t worked for me.</strong></blockquote><p>I hope you can make it happen, I see many companies spend a lot on paid so I bet there is ROI there, just be careful.</p><p>It is easy to spend a lot and don’t get all those signups and paid users you wanted.</p><p>Ok so two things that have worked for us are:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Branded search on google:</strong> pretty much a google tax on keywords containing your “ProductName”. </li><li><strong>Video remarketing ads on youtube:</strong> you amplify already existing conversion paths by showing ads to people who visited your product/pricing/docs or high-intent blog pages. </li></ul><p>That is it... for now.</p><p>We tested many things but the ROI of it wasn’t good so we stopped or continued searching.</p><p>We are testing new things (like Carbon and Ethical ads) right now and we’ll continue experimenting with paid.</p><p>Speaking of experimenting and the ROI.</p><p>A lot of it depends on the targeting, product, copy, landing pages, and campaign goals. </p><p>Below are some channels that I believe can work for the developer audience. </p><h3><a target="_blank" href="https://surfsideppc.com/google-display-ads/">Google Display Network Ads</a></h3><p>Google Display Network (GDN) is an ad network probably 1000x the size of Ethical Ads or Carbon Ads. </p><p>The problem with that is that, unlike Ethical Ads where all the pages are developer-focused, on GDN you get everything. </p><p>As <a target="_blank" href="https://www.poweredbysearch.com/blog/how-to-market-to-software-developers/">suggested by Powered by search, there are two options</a>:</p><ul role="list"><li>you can <strong>specify the conversion event </strong>and let Google optimize your ad targeting for you. </li><li>you can <strong>filter the pages where your ads are shown</strong> to make sure those are visited by your target developers.</li></ul><p>Nothing will happen “magically” here. </p><p>There are many technical aspects behind running ads on GDN and maybe one day I&#39;ll get deeper into it. </p><h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ethicalads.io/">Ethical ads</a></h3><p>It is an ad network, similar to Google Ads, that does display ads on developer-focused pages.</p><p>They call it a</p><blockquote><em>&#34;Transparent Advertising For Developers That Works”</em></blockquote><p>The pages in the network include:</p><ul role="list"><li>developer blogs</li><li>documentation hosted on Read the docs (python projects)</li><li>dev content pages like <a target="_blank" href="https://daily.dev/">https://daily.dev/</a></li><li>projects like <a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">https://flask.palletsprojects.com/</a></li></ul><p>The ads look like this:</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img

href="https://scikit-plot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank">https://scikit-plot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/</a></figcaption></figure><p>What you get with ethical ads are:</p><ul role="list"><li>small, tasteful, non-intrusive ads</li><li>targeting is done by page which can be great if you know your audience</li><li>ads are served in the context of learning/working</li></ul><p>A big downside is that the network is still relatively small but hopefully it will grow with time.</p><p>The concept behind ethical ads is that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/">selling advertising can and should be ethical</a> (no tracking, don’t sell data). </p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertiser-guide/">Running ads on Ethical</a> is pretty straightforward.</p><ul role="list"><li>You get a place for a small visual</li><li>You get a small text field where you can make things bold</li><li>You pay for impressions</li><li>You can filter pages where you show your ads for a bit higher price</li></ul><h3><a href="https://www.carbonads.net/" target="_blank">Carbon Ads (BuySellAds)</a></h3><p>Something in between Ethical ads and Google Display Network ads:</p><ul role="list"><li>the pages your ads are shown on are focused on developer and designer audience (similar to Ethical)</li><li>the ads are displayed in a less minimal way in banners all over those pages (similar to GDN)</li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/620d698731a371e8f686200d_Zrzut%20ekranu%20Deepin_wybierz-obszar_20220216221536.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>https://codepen.io/</figcaption></figure><p>It is also good to mention that Carbon Ads write a lot about <a href="https://content.buysellads.com/advertisers/five-reasons-your-ads-arent-reaching-developers" target="_blank">advertisitng to developers</a> so that you can learn more about it from them. </p><p>The problem for us specifically was that the vast majority of pages are not for machine learning engineers or data scientists. </p><h3><a target="_blank" href="https://ads.twitter.com/">Twitter Ads</a></h3><p>A great thing about Twitter ads is that they appear in-feed as I am scrolling through.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/620d253becf569505771dfe6_Zrzut%20ekranu%20Deepin_wybierz-obszar_20220212173826.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Promoted tweets can include visuals, videos, or be just text.</p><p>There are many targeting features including gender, location, and interests. </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Keywords</strong>: select a keyword that people engaged with (tweeted, commented, liked, reshared etc)</li><li><strong>Follower look-alikes</strong>: look at the followers of an account and create an audience of similar people</li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img

href="https://adespresso.com/blog/twitter-advertising-a-complete-guide/" target="_blank">some good info and examples in this guide from AdEspresso.</a>But ultimately setting up something that works for devs is a bit different.</p><p>One <a target="_blank" href="https://www.poweredbysearch.com/blog/how-to-market-to-software-developers/">tactic that makes a lot of sense (mentioned by powered by search</a>) is to:</p><ul role="list"><li>understand which influencers your target audience follows</li><li>create an audience based on influencer look-alikes (I’d potentially add competitors and tools from the ecosystem to the pack)</li><li>filter out further on keywords people engaged with</li><li>serve ads and hope :)</li></ul><h3><a target="_blank" href="https://advertising.reddithelp.com/en/categories/getting-started/create-a-reddit-ads-account">Reddit Ads</a></h3><p>With Reddit, you can show your promoted posts in the feed or even inside a thread.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/620d255e6a60f4832b6486d5_Zrzut%20ekranu%20Deepin_wybierz-obszar_20220215220627.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Or even inside of a particular conversation.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/620d256cc1155b31444d482e_Zrzut%20ekranu%20Deepin_wybierz-obszar_20220215220733.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>With Reddit ads, you can target developers in particular subreddits like r/MachineLearning or r/devops.</p><p>I wish there was an option to filter on keywords or topics people interacted with (like you can on Twitter) but this option isn’t there yet. </p><h3><a target="_blank" href="https://stackoverflow.com/advertising">Stackoverflow Ads</a></h3><p>Didn’t know that you can run ads on Stackoverflow but apparently, you can.</p><p>It almost looks like an answer to a question, non-intrusive:</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6161939cdc6297e03f7803e0/620d2585b64bf32c98834421_Zrzut%20ekranu%20Deepin_wybierz-obszar_20220215222400.png" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption><a href="https://stackoverflowsolutions.com/topic/client-stories/case-study-twilio" target="_blank">https://stackoverflowsolutions.com/topic/client-stories/case-study-twilio</a></figcaption></figure><p>I think that there is potential here:</p><ul role="list"><li>you can go vs competitors in a tasteful way</li><li>you can promote your deeper blog post on your core product problem</li></ul><p>I really think this could work for the dev audience but haven’t given it a try yet.</p><p>One of the <a href="https://marketingto.dev/" target="_blank">marketingto.dev </a>community members shared that Stackoverflow Ads are not as mature and they offer a managed service rather than self-serve like Twitter or Reddit. </p><p>Either way, I think this can be interesting to some teams.</p><h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/ads/" target="_blank">Youtube Ads</a></h3><p>With youtube ads, you get to play your video to your audience before and during the video they are actually watching right now.</p><p>You get a lot of targeting options (pretty much the same as with Google Search and Google Display Network). </p><p>The problem is: this is intrusive and may not sit well with some devs.</p><p>But I’ve seen companies like <a target="_blank" href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a> run a lot of ads on me.</p><p>Ads I saw other companies do are:</p><ul role="list"><li>Longer tutorials</li><li>Explainer videos</li><li>Blurbs from the case studies</li></ul><p>Those are mostly middle-of-funnel content and were most likely used with retargeting.</p><p>Speaking of, retargeting of explainer and tutorial videos to people who have visited our blog and website worked really well for us.</p><p>We haven’t had much success with cold ads yet.</p><h3><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/google-adwords-ppc">Google Search Ads</a></h3><p>You pay for a keyword and show up in search results. Easy.</p><p>There are various options for positioning the ad:</p><ul role="list"><li>at the <strong>top</strong> of the <a target="_blank" href="https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/serps">SERP</a>: classic and default option for most. </li><li>at the <strong>bottom</strong> of the page: an interesting approach to target people who didn’t find what they were looking for on the first page. </li></ul><p>As with any ad that you put in front of the developer audience. you need to <strong>think about relevancy.</strong></p><p>Is the ad relevant to the search query of a user?</p><p>That depends on the maturity of your niche but typically the relevant queries would fall into a few buckets:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>brand</strong>: “gitlab”, “launchdarkly docs”, “snyk review”</li><li><strong>core feature/use case of your product:</strong> “continuous integration”, “how to manage feature flags”</li><li><strong>brand and core feature typos:</strong> “sntry”, “serch engine”</li><li><strong>competitor alternatives:</strong> “vs circleci”, “bugsnag alternative”</li></ul><p>Depending on your situation you may want to put ads on your competitor&#39;s name or a problem that your ICP has but you don’t solve directly. </p><p>Either way, your return on investment will go down.</p><p>When it comes to Google Search the only thing that worked for me was paying for brand keywords. </p><p>Many other things didn’t work. We tried things like:</p><ul role="list"><li>integrations: running ads for tools we integrate with that link to our docs</li><li>competitor name: running ads on our competitor’s name that go to our “us vs competitor” pages</li><li>feature and use case that links to blog posts and pillar pages</li></ul><p>That said we are still running new experiments. Not all hope is lost just yet :)</p><h3>Retargeting (remarketing)</h3><p>Retargeting works like this:</p><ul role="list"><li>when users visit your website they get a tracking pixel (cookie)</li><li>this cookie is passed to ad platforms</li><li>ads are served to those exact users</li></ul><p>What is great about it is that the targeting is based on your user&#39;s actions.</p><p>You can serve different ads based on the pages people visited (blog vs pricing vs signup page) to make your ads more relevant.</p><p>The problem with retargeting is that many/most people don’t appreciate being tracked. </p><p>Retargeting may also be turned off completely at some point in the near future as people push for more privacy.</p><p>So does it make sense to use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.devmarketingguide.com/">retargeting on devs</a>?</p><p>I’d say, that while it is still allowed, you can probably improve your conversions by using it at later stages of the developer journey (consideration, activation, engagement, upgrades).</p><p>I wouldn’t bet my life on this channel as retargeting may very easily go away with more people pushing for more privacy.</p><h2>What is next?</h2><p>Just go run your ads already 🙂</p><p>If you need a quick framework based on what we talked about, here it is: </p><ul role="list"><li>Figure out what you want to achieve (goal)</li><li>Choose a platform. Make sure your audience is there</li><li>Setup conservative targeting (filter out too much if you have to but make sure you are talking to the right audience)</li><li>Design a practical and relevant ad creative. Use Moat for inspiration</li><li>Connect to the right landing page (amplify paths people are already taking)</li><li>Run a minimal viable test first</li><li>If the test was successful, scale your ad spend</li></ul><p>For inspiration, check out the <a href="https://www.developermarkepear.com/swipe-file" target="_blank">Developer Marketing swipe file.</a></p><h2>Support</h2><p>I hope you liked this article. </p><p>Thanks, and go pears!</p><div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Went on a bit of an exploration journey last month to understand how people run paid ads on the developer audience. </p>— Kuba Czakon 🍐 (@JCzakon) <a href="https://twitter.com/JCzakon/status/1504161792724852737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2022</a></blockquote> </div></div></div></div></div>
