    <h1>Doom has been ported to an earbud</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Let&#39;s switch to a more readable font first.</p><div>
        <p>
          I&#39;ll put out an article / video diving deeper into this later, but here are a few bits of info:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The DOOM port that runs on the earbuds</li>
          <li>The &#39;serial server&#39; that acts as a bridge between the earbuds and the web server and also transcodes the MJPEG stream to twitch</li>
          <li>The web server that serves assets, manages the queue, forwards keypresses and displays the MJPEG stream</li>
          <li>The static webpage that tells your browser what to display on the screen and how to communicate with the web server</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The firmware pushes up against a few hardware limitations:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Serial Connection
            <p>
              Earbuds don&#39;t have displays, so the only way to transfer data to/from them is either via bluetooth, or the UART contact pads.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            CPU
            <p>
              The stock open source firmware has the CPU set to 100mhz, so I cranked that up to 300mhz and disabled low power mode.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            RAM
            <p>
              By default, we only have access to 768KB of RAM, after disabling the co-processor it gets bumped up to the advertised 992KB.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            FLASH
            <p>
              The shareware DOOM 1 wad (assets file) is 4.2MB and the earbuds can only store 4MB of data.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div></div>
