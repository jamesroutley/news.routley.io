<p>Hello! For the last few months we’ve been working on a zine about how integers
and floating point numbers work. Whenever I make a zine I like to release a
playground to go with it, like <a href="https://messwithdns.net/">mess with dns</a> for the DNS zine or the <a href="https://sql-playground.wizardzines.com/">sql playground</a>.</p>

<p>For this one, I made a simple playground called <a href="https://integer.exposed">integer.exposed</a>, inspired by
Bartosz Ciechanowski’s <a href="https://float.exposed">float.exposed</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a lot less elaborate than Mess With DNS, so I’ll keep this blog post short.</p>

<h3 id="the-inspiration-float-exposed">the inspiration: float.exposed</h3>

<p>I did a couple of talks about how integers and floating point work last month,
and in the talk about floating point I found myself CONSTANTLY referring to
this site called <a href="https://float.exposed/">Float Exposed</a> by Bartosz Ciechanowski to demonstrate various things. (Aside: If you haven’t seen
Ciechanowski’s incredible <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/archives/">interactive explainers</a> on bicycles, mechanical watches,
lenses, the internal combustion engine, and more, you should check them out!)</p>

<p>Here’s what it it looks like:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/float-exposed.png"/></p>

<p>Things I’ve done with it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increment the significand of a float (to show people how close together successive floats are)</li>
<li>Show special values like <a href="https://float.exposed/0x7ff8000000000000">NaN</a> and <a href="https://float.exposed/0x7ff0000000000000">infinity</a>, and show how if you change the bits in NaN, it’s still NaN</li>
<li>Go to a <a href="https://float.exposed/0x43abc16d674ec801">large integer value</a> and show how the distance between floats is very large</li>
<li>Show how you get drastically different precision for <a href="https://float.exposed/0x4b189680">one million as a 32-bit float</a> and as a <a href="https://float.exposed/0x416312d000000000">64-bit float</a> (try incrementing the significand for each one!)</li>
</ul>

<p>and lots more! It’s an incredible way to get hands on with floats and improve your intuition around how they work.</p>

<h3 id="float-exposed-but-for-integers">float.exposed, but for integers</h3>

<p>Integers aren’t as complicated as floats, but there are some nonobvious things
about them: you have signed integers and unsigned integers, you have
endianness, and there are some weird operations like right/left shift. So when
I was talking about integers, I found myself wanting a similar website to
<a href="https://float.exposed">float.exposed</a> to demonstrate things.</p>

<p>So with permission, I put one together at <a href="https://integer.exposed">integer.exposed</a>. Here’s a screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="https://jvns.ca/images/int-exposed.png"/></p>

<p>The UI is a little different: integers don’t have many different parts the way
floating point numbers do, so there’s a single row of buttons that you can use
to do various operations on the integer.</p>

<p>A note on byte order: Like float.exposed, it uses a big endian byte order,
because I think it’s more intuitive to read. But you do have to keep in mind
that on most computers the bytes will actually be in the reverse order.</p>

<h3 id="some-interesting-things-to-try">some interesting things to try</h3>

<p>Here are some things I think are fun to try:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>signed integers</strong>: Look at how <a href="https://integer.exposed/#0xff">-1</a> is
represented. Increment and decrement it a few times and see how the signed
and unsigned values change. Do the same with
<a href="https://integer.exposed/#0x80">-128</a>. Also look at how -1 is represented as
a 16/32/64-bit integer.</li>
<li><strong>signed/unsigned right shift</strong>: Similarly with <a href="https://integer.exposed/#0xffff">-1</a>: try out signed right shift (also known as “arithmetic right shift”) and see how the result is different from unsigned right shift (aka “logical right shift”).</li>
<li><strong>counting in binary</strong>: Start at <a href="https://integer.exposed/#0x00">0</a> and increment a bunch of times and watch the binary value count up.</li>
<li><strong>not</strong>: Take any number (like <a href="https://integer.exposed/#0x7b">123</a>) and NOT it. See how <code>NOT</code> is almost exactly the same as negation, but not quite.</li>
<li><strong>swap the byte order</strong>. Take a number like <a href="https://integer.exposed/#0x4e61bc00">12345678</a> and see how if you swap the byte order, the result is an unrecognizably different number.</li>
<li>look at how <a href="https://integer.exposed/#0x00000800">powers of 2 are represented</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-tech-stack">the tech stack</h3>

<p>As usual for me it uses Vue.js. If you want to see how it works you can just
view source – it’s only two files, <code>index.html</code> and <code>script.js</code>.</p>

<p>I took a bunch of the CSS from <a href="https://float.exposed">float.exposed</a>.</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that’s all!</h3>

<p>Let me know if you notice any bugs! I might add more features, but I want to keep it pretty simple.</p>

<p>I’ve also built another more involved playground that I’m hoping to release and
write up soon.</p>
