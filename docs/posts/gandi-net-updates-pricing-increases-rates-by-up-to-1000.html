    <h1>Gandi.net updates pricing, increases rates by up to 1000%</h1>

<hr/>
<p>According to <a href="https://chatting.neocities.org/documents/gandi-pricing-email.html">an email</a> sent to its customers in mid-June, Gandi.net, a major European domain name registration and web hosting company, is <a href="https://gandi.link/eur-prices2023">increasing</a> prices across its entire suite of products.</p>
<p>For domain names, the new prices will usually amount to a 25 to 50% increase, depending on the extension. For example, .com domain prices will jump by 34%, .net by 45%, .org by 32%, etc.</p>
<p>A much steeper price hike is awaiting web hosting customers, who will see their costs almost double in some cases. In particular, the Advanced web hosting plan will be raised from €8.25/month to €15.00/month, an 82% surge.</p>
<p>But by far the most egregious is the email service.</p>
<p>Gandi had already started to inform customers on their intention to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35080777">discontinue</a> their offer of 2 free mailboxes included with every domain name registration, including for users who had pre-paid for multiple years.</p>
<p>Now, Gandi will raise the prices of the Standard mailbox plan from €0.35/month to €3.99/month per mailbox, <b>a 1040% increase</b>. The Premium plan will go from €1.75/month to €5.99/month, a 242% increase.</p>
<p>In its announcement, Gandi appears to justify these price increases by describing the product as “new and improved”, citing increased storage (<i>editor’s note: this does not apply to Premium plan customers</i>) and other nebulous commitments, such as “better anti-spam protection”, and “stronger security”.</p>
<p>The price hikes will come into effect on July 13.</p>
<p><b>It is unclear how with the action of dropping extreme price increases on customers, backed by dubious justifications, and with barely a month’s notice can be reconciled with Gandi’s famous and long-standing <a href="https://www.gandi.net/en/no-bullshit">“No Bullshit” policy</a>.</b></p>
<p>At the time of writing, Gandi has still not updated its website (apart from the <a href="https://www.gandi.net/en/domain/email">email hosting page</a>, which does feature the new prices) to inform potential new customers of the upcoming changes.</p>
