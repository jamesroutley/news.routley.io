    <h1>Kagi Is Bringing Orion Web Browser to Linux</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        
<p><strong>Kagi, the company behind a paid, private search engine</strong><sup data-fn="85d04576-418d-4a25-a22c-8a1b88ea1f05"><a id="85d04576-418d-4a25-a22c-8a1b88ea1f05-link" href="#85d04576-418d-4a25-a22c-8a1b88ea1f05">1</a></sup><strong> of the same name, has announced it’s bringing its Webkit-based <a href="https://kagi.com/orion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Orion</em> web browser</a> to Linux.</strong></p>



<p>In a post on BlueSky, Kagi said: <em>“We’re thrilled to announce that development of the Orion Browser for Linux has officially started!”</em>. </p>



<p><em>Orion</em> is currently only available on macOS and iOS but was built to be better than Apple’s own Safari, and best Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and other browsers in many areas.</p>



<p>Orion is a zero-telemetry browser; has built-in ad and tracking blocking; and reportedly offers lower memory usage, faster page speeds, and greater battery efficiency on Apple devices than other browsers. It also supports both Chrome and Firefox extensions.</p>

<p>Whether all of those USPs can be carried over to Linux—a less defined ‘platform’ than macOS if targeting things like power efficiency—remains to be seen. Kagi is hopeful; they say the Orion Linux build will have feature-parity with the macOS version by next year.</p>



<h2>Orion Browser for Linux</h2>



<p>Obviously, Orion’s (current) closed-source nature will not endear it to everyone. Plenty of Linux users simply can’t countenance using <em>Steam</em>, <em>Spotify</em>, <em>Vivaldi</em>, <em>Slack</em>, <em>Discord</em>, <em>Google Chrome</em>, <em>WhatsApp</em> or other non-free apps, tools, or services.</p>



<p>—That’s fair; we’re free to choose the software that works for us on whatever level that matters, be it utility, integration, or indeed license model.</p>



<p>Yet, the idea of being able to run a fast, user-friendly, and flexible WebKit-based web browser on Linux is a promising development for choice, if nothing else. GNOME Web/Epiphany shows the promise WebKit offers – Orion may bring the polish.</p>



<p>Kagi has started work on open-sourcing <a href="https://github.com/OrionBrowser">many components</a> used in Orion and plans to open source more — the small team is the bottleneck; forking WebKit, porting hundreds of APIs, and building a browser from scratch takes resources.</p>



<p><em>“Properly maintaining an open-source project takes time and resources we’re short on at the moment, so if you want to contribute at this time, please consider becoming active on orionfeedback.org,” they add. </em></p>

<p>The saying goes “if you’re not paying for the product, you are the product” —<em>unless open-source</em>, I tend to add if I hear someone say it! Alas, Mozilla’s recent faux-pas suggests that even noble projects aren’t immune to the shiny glint of <em>ick</em>.</p>



<p><em>Thanks Sambot!</em></p>
