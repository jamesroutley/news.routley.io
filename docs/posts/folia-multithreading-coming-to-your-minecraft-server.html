    <h1>Folia â€“ Multithreading Coming to your Minecraft server</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<hr/><h4 id="project-folia">Project Folia</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia" target="_blank">Folia</a> is the latest project under the <a href="https://papermc.io" target="_blank">PaperMC</a> organization, which aims to achieve true multithreading and regionalized ticking. The goal of this project is to provide better scalability and performance, while fixing a few longstanding issues that have been the limiting factor to scaling up a Minecraft server.</p>
<p>Folia is a fork of Paper by none other than the Minecraft optimization legend <a href="https://github.com/Spottedleaf" target="_blank">Spottedleaf</a>. Originally started in August 2020, just before Tuinity merged with Paper, Folia represents the culmination of a series of prerequisite patches, including Starlight, player chunkmap, and chunk rewrite which were added onto Paper in the last few years.</p>
<p>Spottedleaf has systematically tackled the roadblocks in Vanilla Minecraft that prevented all previous attempts at multithreading by countless other developers and projects. The goal of the Folia project is to provide a no-compromise solution for a true multithreaded server, achieved through a brand new set of APIs designed specifically for this environment.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to present the information in an easy-to-understand format and provide some detailed insights that may not necessarily be included in the official announcement.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/PaperMC/Folia" target="_blank">Official Folia GitHub Page</a></p>

<p><a href="#introduction">Introduction to Folia</a></p>
<hr/><h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Folia<a href="https://www.paper-chan.moe/folia/#introduction">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p><strong>Folia</strong> groups nearby loaded chunks to form an &#34;independent region.&#34; Each independent region has its own tick loop, which is ticked at the regular Minecraft tickrate (20TPS). The tick loops are executed on a thread pool in parallel. There is no main thread anymore, as each region effectively has its own &#34;main thread&#34; that executes the entire tick loop. Note that each region does not have a unique thread, but rather shares threads from a configurable threadpool.</p>
<p>For a server with many spread out players, Folia will create many spread out regions and tick them all in parallel - which will perform significantly better than the current method of ticking all worlds one after the other.</p>
<p>For technical details:</p>
<p><strong>It is worth noting that the &#34;region&#34; referred to in Folia is not the same as the region in Vanilla Minecraft. Instead, it is defined as follows:</strong></p>
<p><code>A region is simply a set of owned chunk positions and implementation defined unique data object tied to that region. It is important to note that for any non-dead region x, that for each chunk position y it owns that there is no other non-dead region z such that the region z owns the chunk position y.</code></p>
<div><p>ðŸ’¡</p><p>Imagine each active region as a bubble! When two bubbles get close, they will merge into a bigger bubble.</p></div><p>The entire process of region creation, merge, and separation is handled by the Regioniser governed by <a href="https://docs.papermc.io/folia/reference/region-logic" target="_blank">Fundamental regionising logic</a>.</p>
<hr/><h2 id="comparison">Benefits of Folia<a href="https://www.paper-chan.moe/folia/#comparison">ðŸ”—</a></h2><h4 id="what-are-the-benefits-of-folia">What are the benefits of Folia?</h4>
<p>Unlike the countless failed attempts at multithreading that are plagued with bugs and game-breaking behavioral changes, Folia is built on a strong foundation and is created by someone with a deep understanding of the Vanilla codebase.</p>
<p>Many forks of Paper have tried to optimize server further, but with limited success due to the main tick loop is still ran within a single thread. This is a hard ceiling that a simple fork of Paper cannot overcome without some drastic changes, such as those made in Folia.</p>
<hr/><h4 id="who-are-likely-to-see-benefits-running-folia">Who are likely to see benefits running Folia?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medium to large sized server with sufficient hardwares (threads) to support it.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Folia shines when the server has unused threads, as each region is now ticked independently. This should result in a noticeable performance gain, especially with powerful hardware.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Survival multiplayer, anarchy, skyblocks, or some mini-games server.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Game modes such as survival multiplayer and skyblock, in which players are often spread apart, can fully utilize the regionizer and provide additional performance boosts that were previously not achievable on Paper.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smaller server networks that are looking to scale up their operations.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Large networks that already have custom sharding solutions for their scaling problems may not be too interested, as they have already invested a significant amount into their infrastructure. However, Folia will enable smaller server owners who may not have the necessary budget for such an endeavor yet to scale up their operations without drastically complicating their setup.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single Core performance is no longer the only option to increase performance</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Server owners now have more options when picking a suitable CPU for their Minecraft servers. Single-threaded performance is no longer the only factor directly related to performance. Instead, a slightly lower clock speed but higher core count CPU model may not only save the server owner a few bucks but also provide more benefits than top-of-the-line CPUs, which often come at a premium cost.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Will I see performance increase as a small survival server owner?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>&#34;Yes,&#34; <em>if you have sufficient threads available.</em> Folia may benefit smaller niche server owners who wish to restore mob spawning behavior closer to Vanilla. It allows them to create larger farms without negatively impacting the overall server performance.</p>
<p><img src="https://paper-chan.moe/content/images/2023/03/TPS3.png" alt="TPS3" loading="lazy"/></p>
<div><p>ðŸ’¡</p><p>It is recommended to have a minimum 16 physical cores in order to fully benefit from Folia.</p></div><hr/><h4 id="breaking-the-hard-ceiling">Breaking the hard ceiling...</h4>
<p><strong>The current maximum capacity for a Minecraft server with Vanilla-like configuration is around 60-80 players.</strong> There is no server software that can handle more players without compromising the Vanilla feel or imposing harsh limits on player freedom. Folia is here to change that!</p>
<div><p>ðŸ™„</p><p>Let&#39;s be real here, playing on a server with 3 view distance and 8 mobs per player suck.Â </p></div><hr/><h4 id="some-interesting-facts-on-folia">Some interesting facts on Folia</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lag is now localized.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Players with super large farms will no longer tank server TPS as a whole; rather, the TPS drop will be contained within that particular region.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Entity spawning behavior is now closer to Vanilla single player</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>An enhanced TPS report</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>

<hr/><h2 id="admin">Admin Support<a href="https://www.paper-chan.moe/folia/#admin">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The success of the Folia project relies on you - the many server owners and admins who have helped make Paper the enormous success it is today. To ensure a smooth launch for Folia, we encourage everyone to join the discussion and help test the software in order to identify any issues or bugs that may arise.</p>
<p>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/papermc" target="_blank">Paper Discord</a> here and be part of the discussion!</p>
<hr/><h2 id="developer">Developer Support<a href="https://www.paper-chan.moe/folia/#developer">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>If you are a developer and wish to provide support for Folia, please check out <a href="https://docs.papermc.io/folia/reference/overview" target="_blank">Folia Project overview</a> and join the discussion in <a href="https://discord.gg/papermc" target="_blank">PaperMC Discord community</a>.</p>
<p>Your expertise is the most valuable feedback for us. This is also a rare chance to fix a few longstanding issues that have been plaguing the CraftBukkit and Spigot ecosystem. Together, we can build a better foundation for the future of Minecraft!</p>
<p>To prevent end users from loading any Paper plugin onto Folia without first confirming its compatibility, we have added a check to the plugin&#39;s plugin.yml file using <code>folia-supported: true</code>. If your plugin requires no update, this would be a simple one-line change to ensure compatibility with Folia.</p>
<hr/><h2 id="plugins">Folia Plugins<a href="https://www.paper-chan.moe/folia/#plugins">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Due to the aforementioned API changes, existing Paper plugins are not likely to work with Folia out of the box. Ideally, <a href="https://hangar.papermc.io" target="_blank">Hangar</a> would be a perfect hub to discover Folia-compatible plugins; however, it is still currently in closed beta.</p>
<p>In the meantime, this guide will maintain a list of plugins that support Folia. If you are a developer and interested in having your plugin listed here, please contact <a href="https://discordapp.com/users/177150983258767360" target="_blank">EterNity</a> via Discord.</p>
<p><em>Pending API announcements... and more Folia supported plugin to come...!</em></p>

<hr/><h2 id="special">Special Thanks<a href="https://www.paper-chan.moe/folia/#special">ðŸ”—</a></h2>
<p>Thank you for your continued support of the project. The Folia open beta testing, initially for <a href="https://opencollective.com/papermc" target="_blank">sponsors</a> and later open to the public, was a successful and enjoyable community bonding activity. Together, we can create the best Minecraft community!!</p>
<h4 id="to-entire-paper-chan-discord">To entire Paper Chan Discord:</h4>
<p>This section is dedicated to you - the many closed beta testers of the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/7avyUQFnnj" target="_blank">Paper Chan Discord</a> <s>cult</s> community who took the time to show up for testing, helped identify issues in the early stages, and were supportive while keeping the project a secret. It was genuinely a pleasant experience, and the voice chat was super fun! You guys rock!</p>
<hr/><h2 id="records">Folia Testing Records<a href="https://www.paper-chan.moe/folia/#records">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Below is a record of our Public testing...</p>
<h4 id="what-has-our-public-and-private-testing-shown">What has our public and private testing shown?</h4>
<p><strong>The &#34;Regioniser&#34; (region logic) can fully utilize all 32 CPU threads without any apparent bottleneck or significant degradation of performance.</strong></p>
<div><p>ðŸ˜Ž</p><p>But wait, why stop at 32 cores!? it&#39;s go big or go home!!</p></div><p>By a stroke of luck, we managed to snatch a server with dual AMD EPYC CPUs with following specs!</p>
<ul>
<li>2x AMD EPYC 7713 (128c/256t @ 2.0 GHz)</li>
<li>2x 480GB SSD</li>
<li>10x 6.4TB NVMe</li>
<li>2TB RAM</li>
<li>25TB Bandwidth</li>
<li>25Gbps Network</li>
</ul>
<p>The server was able to handle the ultimate stress test of pinging everyone in PaperMC discord and publish the message for thousands of server to see.</p>
<p>At its peak, the testing server was able to handle <strong>over 320 players</strong> on a brand new, ungenerated map without major issues or TPS drops. We did find a few issues, and valuable stack traces were collected and documented during the process.</p>
<p>With over 500 peak viewers on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/spottedstar" target="_blank">Spottedleaf&#39;s Twitch</a> and over 180 audience on Discord staging channel, it was an epic first impression and overall a very successful public stress test!</p>
<p>Belows are some fun screenshots from our test!</p>

<p><strong>Do I need a spec like this to drive Folia?</strong></p>
<p>No, this was purely done as a proof of concept. The hardware we acquired for the public test is a complete overkill, and every aspect of it was just ridiculous. I hope it makes a drastic first impression!</p>
<p><strong>Do I need 500GB of RAM and Shenandoah GC to run Folia?</strong></p>
<p>No, it was just a rare chance for us to test Shenandoah GC as this is the perfect environment it is made for. G1GC with <a href="https://docs.papermc.io/paper/aikars-flags" target="_blank">Aikar&#39;s flag</a> is still recommended and the most suitable GC for the majority of Minecraft servers.</p>
