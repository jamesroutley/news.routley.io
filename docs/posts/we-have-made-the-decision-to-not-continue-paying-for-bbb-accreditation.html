    <p>We have made the conscious choice not to continue paying for accreditation from the Better Business Bureau (BBB). We realize that this may raise questions among our customers, and we want to explain why we made this decision.</p>
<p>For years, people have been told to look for BBB accredited businesses, and that it somehow reflects whether a business is on the up and up.<span>  </span>What most don’t realize is that businesses PAY to be accredited with the BBB. You do not EARN an accreditation- you buy it.</p>
<p>A few months ago, an extremely negative complaint and review suddenly appeared under our name registered with the BBB.<span>  </span>It was a person who was upset that a Sting concert was cancelled due to fire. Their complaint was with a Music company that happened to have Cherry Tree in their name, but our business was tagged and reflected poor business practices.<span>  </span>We contacted the BBB many times to ask to please remove this complaint, that was obviously NOT for CherryTree Computers, from our business page.<span>  </span>No one at the BBB was willing or able to assist with our request…because they really don’t have the control or ability to do anything in the event of incorrect information. </p>
<p>This led us to then wonder…. Well, what exactly DOES the BBB do? Why would we continue to pay for accreditation if it only means we get to have the BBB logo on our website, but they don’t actually have the ability to prove or disprove how reputable a company is when it comes to business practices?<span>  </span>We expressed to the BBB multiple times that if the situation wasn’t rectified, we would stop paying for accreditation and let our customers know why.</p>
<p>After a lot of waiting and no action at all from the BBB, we officially ended our relationship and will no longer pay for BBB accreditation. </p>
<p>We hope our services and happy customers reflect what type of business we are….and that we don’t need any special logo or stickers to prove it.</p>
