    <h1>CocoaPods trunk read-only plan</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p><strong>TLDR: In two years we plan to turn CocoaPods trunk to be read-only. At that point, no new versions or pods will be added to trunk.</strong> - Note, this post has been updated in May 2025.</p>

<p>Last month I wrote about how CocoaPods is currently being maintained, I also noted that we were discussing converting the main CocoaPods spec repo &#34;trunk&#34; to be read-only:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are discussing that on a very long, multi-year, basis we can drastically simplify the security of CocoaPods trunk by converting the Specs Repo to be read-only. Infrastructure like the Specs repo and the CDN would still operate as long as GitHub and jsDelivr continue to exist, which is pretty likely to be a very long time. <strong>This will keep all existing builds working</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I plan to implement the read-only mode so that when someone submits a new Podspec to CocoaPods, it will always be denied at the server level. I would then convert the &#34;CocoaPods/Specs&#34; repo to be marked as &#34;Archived&#34; on GitHub which should cover all of our bases.</p>

<p>Making the switch will not break builds for people using CocoaPods in 2026 onwards, but at that point, you&#39;re not getting any more updates to dependencies which come though CocoaPods trunk. This shouldn&#39;t affect people who use CocoaPods with their own specs repos, or have all of their dependencies vendored (e.g. they all come from npm.)</p>

<p><em>May 2025</em> Update: Since this post was originally written, we&#39;ve had enough security researchers abusing scripting capabilities in CocoaPods that we are now introducing a block on allowing new CocoaPods to use the <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#prepare_command"><code>prepare_command</code></a> field in a Podspec. Any existing Pods using <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#prepare_command"><code>prepare_command</code></a> are hard-coded to bypass this check.</p>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>

<p>My goal is to send 2 very hard-to-miss notifications en-masse, and then do a test run a month before the final shutdown.</p>

<h3 id="may-2025">May 2025</h3>

<p>We are stopping new CocoaPods from being added which use the <a href="https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#prepare_command"><code>prepare_command</code></a> field</p>

<h3 id="mid-late-2025">Mid-late 2025</h3>

<p>I will email all email addresses for people who have contributed a Podspec, informing them of the impending switch to read-only, and linking them to this blog post.</p>

<h3 id="september-october-2026">September-October 2026</h3>

<p>I will, again, email all email addresses for people who have contributed a Podspec, informing them of the impending switch to read-only, and linking them to this blog post, noting that they have roughly a month before we do a test run of going read-only.</p>

<h3 id="november-1-7th-2026">November 1-7th 2026</h3>

<p>I will trigger a test run, giving automation a chance to break early</p>

<h3 id="december-2nd-2026">December 2nd 2026</h3>

<p>I will switch trunk to not accept new Podspecs permanently. This is a Wednesday after American Thanksgiving, so I think folks won&#39;t be in rush mode.</p>



<p>These dates are not set in stone, and maybe someone out there has a good reason for us to amend the timeline. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m amenable to moving it forwards, but within reason there&#39;s space for backwards.</p>
