    <h1>Tell HN: Google is correlating location data to your IP</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi HN, Is this a known thing? I&#39;m pretty frustrated, and even given my near-complete disillusionment about capital-driven-tech these days, I can&#39;t believe Google is doing this.</p><p>I just got home from being in Mexico where I used my VPN (because of course US financial apps panic if you access them outside the US).</p><p>I fired up my LG TV running the YouTube app (which I&#39;m not signed into) and every, single, ad is in Spanish.</p><p>My Edge browser on my desktop computer gives results in Mexico and claims I&#39;m in Quintanna Roo. In many places, I cannot override this, at least without signing in and/or apparently explicitly feeding it more accurate location data to &#34;fix&#34; it&#39;s perception.</p><p>Is this expected/known? At one point, it even said &#34;based on your IP address&#34; despite the fact that my IP clearly looks up to a Washington State IP address.</p><p>I just wish I could make this known to Google&#39;s advertisers. Are they aware that when I travel, they&#39;re pay to show me ads that I can&#39;t understand?</p></div></div></div>
