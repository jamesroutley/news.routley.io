    <h1>AMA: I&#39;m Dave Greene, an Accidental Expert on Conway&#39;s Game of Life</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I drifted into the Conway&#39;s Life research community in 2001 when I won a small cash prize for a lucky discovery of something called a &#34;boojum reflector&#34;. My involvement has gradually snowballed since then. Off and on I&#39;ve helped maintain various Life-related mailing lists and blogs, the Life Lexicon, and more recently the conwaylife.com forums and LifeWiki.</p><p>Another thing I stumbled into was helping Nathaniel Johnson complete an improbably thorough 480-page Conway&#39;s Life textbook, with end-of-chapter exercises and everything.  The book could be used to teach a college-level class on the subject. https://conwaylife.com/book/ has a free PDF download for the book.</p><p>So... I&#39;m not the cleverest Lifenthusiast by a long shot, but for a random question about the Game of Life, I&#39;m more likely to know something about it than at least 99.9999% of the world&#39;s population.  Ask me anything!</p></div></div></div>
