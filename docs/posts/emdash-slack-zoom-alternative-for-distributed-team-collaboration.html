<p><span>Here’s how emdash helps:</span></p>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Threaded discussions.</strong><span> Organize conversations, resources, and decisions by topic, so it’s easy to find information and get up to speed.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Integrated chat &amp; video.</strong><span> Meetings are automatically recorded, archived, and linked to relevant discussions. AI-generated summaries and transcripts ensure no context is lost.<br/>
</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span><strong>Powerful search with insights.</strong> Instantly locate key information without digging through Slack, email, Zoom, or Notion. emdash’s Assistant can help you uncover takeaways and insights across conversations.</span></li>

			<div><p><span>With limited time in the day, real-time conversations should be about decisions, not catching up. emdash keeps teams informed asynchronously, so meetings stay focused and productive.</span></p>

<p><span>Here’s how emdash helps:</span></p>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Knowledge management.</strong> Full history and context from chat, meetings, and shared resources ensure everyone is up to speed before real-time discussions.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Custom access controls.</strong> Manage visibility so the right people stay informed and empower decision-makers with the information they need to take action.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Seamless transition to meetings.</strong> Instantly start a video chat when async isn’t enough—without switching tools or waiting for everyone to join.</li>
</ul>

			<div><p><span>Remote work thrives on focus, but constant pings and scattered tools make it hard to stay in the zone. emdash helps you find the signal in the noise, streamline workflows, and keeps your team in flow so they can focus on meaningful work.</span></p>

<p>Here’s how emdash helps:</p>

<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Smarter notifications.</strong> Stay focused without fear of missing out. Subscribe to important conversations and only receive relevant updates. Say goodbye to endless notifications.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Effortless re-engagement.</strong> When you’re ready to dive back in, quickly triage, prioritize, and follow up on unread mentions, private messages, and flagged conversations with just a few clicks.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><span><strong>All-in-one workspace.</strong> Stop breaking your concentration and switching between Slack, email, Zoom, and Notion. emdash integrates chat, meetings, and knowledge in one place, so you can stay focused and get things done.</span></li>
