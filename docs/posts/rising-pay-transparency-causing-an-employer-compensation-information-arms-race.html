And more employers are also including a range of non-cash benefits, perks and flexibility options in their job postings, according to a recent ZipRecruiter <a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com/blog/pay-trends-report/#:~:text=72%25%20of%20employers%20surveyed%20said,post%20pay%20(74%25%20vs." target="_blank">survey</a> on pay transparency.</p><p>The survey found that 72% of employers post pay information on all job listings, taking the percentage of postings with salaries listed into the range of 50% to 60% on ZipRecruiter.</p><p>Other job sites are observing similar trends.</p><p><strong>More from Personal Finance:</strong></p><p>For example, at Indeed, state laws requiring pay transparency have helped push employers to list salary ranges, especially in sectors like software development and technology, Indeed economist Cory Stahle said.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;ve seen a pretty dramatic uptick in the number of employers who are actually even including wages on our job postings,&#34; Stahle said.</p><p>The number of employers that include wages in their job postings has increased significantly this year, in part due to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/30/companies-lower-salaries-in-job-postings-due-to-pay-transparency-laws.html">impact of laws in states</a> such as California, Colorado and Washington. In addition, the tight labor market and pay transparency are acting as dual forces — with employers posting wages and benefits up front as a way to attract workers who have been difficult to draw in.</p></div><div role="region" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107325290"><div role="button" tabindex="0" id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-107325290" data-vilynx-id="7000320729" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder"><div id="InlineVideo-0" data-test="InlineVideo"><div><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107325291-16986664501698666447-31810609519-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1698666449&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="48% of companies lowered advertised salaries in the past year, survey finds"/><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div></div><div><p>While those seeking jobs may find more initial transparency about compensation, the negotiations process when hiring is getting more challenging, said Aaron Terrazas, Glassdoor&#39;s chief economist.</p><p>&#34;Recruiters can feel less flexibility and ... less ability to negotiate with candidates and raise pay,&#34; Terrazas said.</p><p>As a result, pay transparency has not significantly altered average wage ranges listed in job postings, even though those ranges have somewhat widened.</p><p>&#34;When we talk about a little bit of widening, it&#39;s not necessarily that these jobs are now all of a sudden having $500,000 ranges,&#34; Stahle said. &#34;We&#39;re talking about a few percentage points.&#34;</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>Pay listings avoid &#39;wasting recruiters&#39; time&#39;</h2><div><p>Beyond any material impact on wage levels, rising pay transparency has had the largest effect on how employees and employers behave during the job-seeking and hiring processes.</p><p>Employers are using pay transparency to attract candidates who are actually willing to receive the pay that is listed — and discourage others from applying &#34;instead of wasting recruiters&#39; time,&#34; Pollak said.</p><p>&#34;I think many of them are kind of patient and prepared to hold out for those candidates prepared to sort of suck it up and accept what they&#39;re giving,&#34; she added.</p><p>The challenge that pay transparency presents to employers is that jobs with pay information tend to draw more applicants, as knowing the salary helps applicants determine if a job could support their current cost of living. To address these issues and allow for negotiation, some employers have narrowed the maximum wage limit.</p></div><div><p>As it becomes normal to know the salary for a job when applying, employees stand to benefit from <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/20/what-you-can-learn-from-tiktok-instagram-salary-videos.html">becoming more aware</a> of other perks, too.</p><p>For private industry workers, benefits account for 29.4% of compensation, compared to 31.4% for civilian workers overall, according to the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/ecec.pdf" target="_blank">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>.</p><p>&#34;Pay transparency in some ways moves the competition away from salaries, away from wages and toward non cash benefits, or toward equity comp, toward flexibility,&#34; Terrazas said.</p></div><div><p>In fact, knowing how much a job pays beforehand could actually take a factor out of jobseekers&#39; reasoning, as they consider other things that &#34;are really important&#34; but masked by salary, said LaCinda Glover, a senior principal consultant at Mercer. These include job culture, benefit programs, managerial issues and career development.</p><p>In the year to come, pay transparency &#34;will start putting pressure on organizations to look at other factors as pay becomes a little bit more of a known fact,&#34; Glover said.</p></div></div></div>
