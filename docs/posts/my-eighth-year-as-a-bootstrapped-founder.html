    <h1>My eighth year as a bootstrapped founder</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eight years ago, I <a href="https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/">quit my job as a developer at Google</a> to create my own bootstrapped software company. Every year, I <a href="https://mtlynch.io/tags/annual-review/">post an update</a> about how that’s going and what my life is like as an indie founder.</p><h2 id="previously-on">Previously on…<a href="#previously-on" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><p>I don’t expect you to go back and read my last seven updates. Here’s all you need to know:</p><ul><li>2018 - 2020 - <a href="https://mtlynch.io/why-i-quit-google/">Quit my job</a> and created several unprofitable businesses.</li><li>2020 - 2024 - Created <a href="https://mtlynch.io/tinypilot">a product called TinyPilot</a> that let people control their computers remotely.</li><li>2024 - <a href="https://mtlynch.io/i-sold-tinypilot/">Sold TinyPilot</a>, <a href="https://mtlynch.io/bootstrapped-founder-year-7/#i-became-a-new-parent">became a father</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="how-finances-went">How finances went<a href="#how-finances-went" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><p>People are always most interested in how money works as an indie founder, so I’ll start there. Here’s what my revenue and profit looked like every month this year.</p><p>In total, I had $8.2k in profit on $16.3k in revenue. That was my total income for the year, which is obviously not enough to support a family, but my wife also works, and we have savings/investments.</p><p>My main source of revenue was my book. I’m writing <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com">a book to teach developers to improve their writing</a>. I did a Kickstarter for it in March, which gave me <a href="https://mtlynch.io/my-6k-advance/">$6k in pre-sales</a>. As I worked on the book, I offered paid early access. In total, 422 readers purchased early access, for which I’m grateful. I also have an <a href="https://mtlynch.io/bootstrapped-founder-year-1/#zestful">old business</a> that makes $100-200/month without me touching it.</p><p>My main expenses were computer hardware ($2.1k) and LLMs ($1.9k). I don’t use AI to write, but I use it for a lot of the accessory tasks like fixing rendering/layout issues and improving the website. I also use it for <a href="https://codeberg.org/mtlynch?tab=repositories">my open-source projects</a>.</p><p>Here’s how 2025 compared to previous years:</p><p>The years I was running TinyPilot dominate the chart. Still, 2025 was my fourth most profitable year as a founder.</p><p>My goal for the year was $50k in profit, so I fell quite short (more on that <a href="#earn-50k-in-profit">later</a>).</p><h2 id="so-youre-still-taking-a-break">So you’re still taking a break?<a href="#so-youre-still-taking-a-break" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><p>When I tell other software developers that I’m writing a book, they usually say something like, “Oh, great!”</p><p>Then, they pause, a little confused. “To give you time to freelance?” And I have to say, “No, I’m <em>just</em> writing a book. That’s my whole job.”</p><p>When I tell friends and family I’m working on a book, they innocently ask, “Oh, so you’re still on paternity leave?”</p><p>No! I’m writing a book. It’s a real job!</p><p>But if I’m being honest, I understand their confusion. How can writing a book be my job? I’m not a novelist.</p><p>When I started the book, I thought I’d be done in six months. I typically write almost a book’s worth of blog posts per year, and that’s just from an hour of writing per day. If I focus on a book, I should be done in 1/8th the time!</p><p>It turns out that even when all I have to do is write, I can still only write for about an hour per day. After that, I feel drained, and my writing degrades rapidly.</p><p>I also can’t <em>just</em> write a book. I also need to find people to read the book, so I’ve been writing blog posts and sharing chapter excerpts. I normally write 5-10 blog posts per year, but I ended up writing far more in the past year than I ever have before:</p><ul><li>13 blog posts (8 on <a href="https://mtlynch.io/posts/">my personal blog</a> and 5 on <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/blog/">my book’s blog</a>)</li><li>12 <a href="https://mtlynch.io/notes/">notes</a> (shorter, less polished blog posts)</li><li>12 <a href="https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/">monthly retrospectives</a></li><li>150 pages of my book, including seven chapters I adapted into <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/chapters/">free excerpts</a></li></ul><p>I also started editing blog posts for other developers. That helped me discover other developers’ writing pain points and what advice they found effective. I worked with seven clients, including <a href="https://tylercipriani.com/">Tyler Cipriani</a> on <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/services/blog-editing/sample-future-of-git/">a post</a> that reached <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44916783">#1 on Hacker News</a>.</p><p>And then there’s just a bunch of administrative tasks around writing and selling a book like <a href="https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2025/10/#the-hassle-of-sending-post-purchase-emails-with-stripe">setting up mailing lists</a>, <a href="https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2026/01/#adding-regional-pricing-for-my-book">dealing with Stripe</a>, <a href="https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2025/05/#asciidoctor-so-far-so-good">debugging PDF/epub rendering issues</a>, etc.</p><h2 id="finding-alignment-with-my-business">Finding alignment with my business<a href="#finding-alignment-with-my-business" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><p>This has been my favorite year of being a founder since I went off on my own eight years ago. There are a few factors, but the biggest is that I found a business that aligns with me.</p><p>When I first started as a founder, I didn’t think the particulars of a business mattered. I just pursued any opportunity I saw, even if it was a market I didn’t care about. I’d still get to write software, so wouldn’t that make me happy?</p><p>It turns out bootstrapped founders don’t spend much time writing code. Especially at the beginning, I have to find customers and talk to them, which is hard when I don’t particularly care about the market beyond the technical challenge of building something.</p><p>Over several years, I found that there are five criteria that determine how much I enjoy a business:</p><ol><li>I enjoy the domain and relate to the customers</li><li>It leverages my skills</li><li>It earns money</li><li>It facilitates work-life balance</li><li>It aligns interests between me and my users</li></ol><p>As a concrete example, one of my first businesses was called Is It Keto. It was a simple website that explained whether certain foods fit the keto diet.</p><figure><a href="https://mtlynch.io/bootstrapped-founder-year-8/isitketo-screenshot.webp"><img sizes="(min-width: 768px) 450px, 98vw" srcset="/bootstrapped-founder-year-8/isitketo-screenshot_hu_917b42de36281513.webp 300w, /bootstrapped-founder-year-8/isitketo-screenshot_hu_3778cb8631fa5bf4.webp 600w, /bootstrapped-founder-year-8/isitketo-screenshot_hu_aff4937e76f149a9.webp 800w, /bootstrapped-founder-year-8/isitketo-screenshot.webp 1043w" src="https://mtlynch.io/bootstrapped-founder-year-8/isitketo-screenshot.webp" alt="Screenshot of Is It Keto website" loading="lazy"/></a><figcaption><p>One of my first businesses, Is It Keto, which told readers which foods fit the keto diet.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Here’s how Is It Keto scored on my rubric:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pillar</th><th>Score</th><th>Notes</th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Enjoyment</td><td><span title="Bad">❌</span></td><td>I didn’t care about the keto diet.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Competence</td><td><span title="Bad">❌</span></td><td>I wasn’t good at building websites, finding users, or convincing anyone to buy things.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Profitability</td><td><span title="Bad">❌</span></td><td>The site was <a href="https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2020/07/#is-it-keto">not profitable</a>.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Work-life balance</td><td><span title="Good">✅</span></td><td>The site was easy to keep online 24/7. Even if there had been an outage, the stakes were so low that I’d only be losing a few dollars of ad revenue per day.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Founder-user alignment</td><td><span title="Bad">❌</span></td><td>I only made money if users clicked ads or ordered keto products online. They probably would have been better off buying <a href="https://realfood.gov/">real food</a> at the grocery store.</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Now, let me compare Is It Keto to writing my book:</p><div><h3 id="refactoring-english-my-book"><em>Refactoring English</em> (my book)<a href="#refactoring-english-my-book" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3></div><table><thead><tr><th>Pillar</th><th>Score</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Enjoyment</td><td><span title="Good">✅</span></td><td>I’m passionate about clear writing and enjoy teaching techniques to other developers.</td></tr><tr><td>Competence</td><td><span title="Good">✅</span></td><td>I feel especially qualified to write about the topic, as I’ve been blogging for several years, and writing played a key role at every stage in my career.</td></tr><tr><td>Profitability</td><td><span title="Okay">⚠️</span></td><td>I’ve made $11.8k from pre-sales, which feels good for a first-time author but is not yet profitable enough to be sustainable.</td></tr><tr><td>Work-life balance</td><td><span title="Good">✅</span></td><td>It’s hard to beat an ebook in terms of work-life balance. I can comfortably disappear for weeks without negatively impacting anyone. I’ve never been paged at 2 AM because my servers are down and users urgently need to read my book.</td></tr><tr><td>Founder-user alignment</td><td><span title="Good">✅</span></td><td>My incentives are aligned with my readers because I <a href="https://refactoringenglish.com/early-access/#satisfaction-guarantee">only make money if they enjoy the book</a>, and the book only becomes popular if readers recommend it to friends.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The book doesn’t check all my boxes perfectly, but it aligns better with my five criteria than any business I’ve created before.</p><h2 id="do-i-still-love-it">Do I still love it?<a href="#do-i-still-love-it" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><p>At the end of <a href="https://mtlynch.io/bootstrapped-founder-year-1/">my first year as a founder</a>, I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>As someone who has always valued independence, I love being a solo developer. It makes a world of difference to wake up whenever I want and make my own choices about how to spend my entire day.</p><p>…</p><p>My friends with children tell me that kids won’t complicate this at all.</p></blockquote><p>When I wrote that in 2019, I was in my early thirties, single, and living alone.</p><p>A few weeks after writing that post, I met someone. We moved in together at the end of that year, married a few years later, and had our first child in 2024. Now, there are lots of people in our house, as my wife and I work from home, and members of our extended family come over every weekday to help with childcare.</p><p>Despite all of those changes, my life is still how I described it seven years ago.</p><p>Okay, things aren’t <em>exactly</em> the same. My toddler decides when I wake up, and it’s not always the time his independence-loving father would choose. But I still feel the joy of spending my workdays on whatever I choose.</p><p>I joked back in 2019 about how kids would complicate my life as an indie founder, but it’s actually less complicated than I expected. My workdays mostly look the same. Except they’re more fun because anytime I want, I can take a break from work to go play with my son.</p><p>After several years of <a href="https://mtlynch.io/bootstrapped-founder-year-6/#do-i-still-love-it">just “enjoying” life</a> as a bootstrapped founder, I’m happy to say that I love it again. I still want to do it forever.</p><h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned<a href="#lessons-learned" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><h3 id="writing-a-book-takes-longer-than-i-expected">Writing a book takes longer than I expected<a href="#writing-a-book-takes-longer-than-i-expected" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>I originally thought I’d finish the book in six months, but I’m <a href="https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2026/01/">13 months in</a> and still have about 20% left.</p><p>From reading about other developers’ experience writing books, underestimating time seems to be the norm. Teiva Harsanyi thought he’d be done in eight months, but it actually took him <a href="https://www.thecoder.cafe/p/100-go-mistakes">almost two years</a>. Austin Henley started writing a book in 2023 and it dragged on for about two years before he got tired of working with his publisher and <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/canceledbookdeal.html">canceled his book deal</a>.</p><h3 id="i-enjoy-my-work-when-it-feels-aligned-with-me">I enjoy my work when it feels aligned with me<a href="#i-enjoy-my-work-when-it-feels-aligned-with-me" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>As much as I love writing code, programming itself isn’t enough to make me enjoy my work. I need to find a business that matches my interests, values, and skills.</p><h3 id="i-can-be-a-bootstrapped-founder-and-a-parent">I can be a bootstrapped founder and a parent<a href="#i-can-be-a-bootstrapped-founder-and-a-parent" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><p>Before I became a parent, I worried that I wouldn’t have the flexibility to be a founder. In the first few months after my son arrived, I worried that parenting would take up so much time that I <a href="https://mtlynch.io/retrospectives/2024/10/#ill-be-okay-if-i-dont-work-for-a-bit">couldn’t work at all</a>, much less run my own business.</p><p>Fortunately, I’ve been able to find a comfortable balance where I spend my workdays as a founder while still being the parent I want to be.</p><h2 id="grading-last-years-goals">Grading last year’s goals<a href="#grading-last-years-goals" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h2><p>Last year, I set <a href="https://mtlynch.io/bootstrapped-founder-year-7/#goals-for-next-year">three high-level goals</a> that I wanted to achieve during the year. Here’s how I did against those goals:</p><h3 id="earn-50k-in-profit">Earn $50k in profit<a href="#earn-50k-in-profit" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Result</strong>: I earned $8.2k in profit.</li><li><strong>Grade</strong>: D</li></ul><p>I wasn’t confident I’d earn $50k from the book, but I thought I’d have time while writing to launch side businesses. I also expected to complete the book in just six months, giving me even more time for new business ideas in the second half of the year.</p><p>Instead, I spent the full year on the book. It made $11.8k, which I’m proud of as pre-sales for a first-time author, but it’s less than I hoped to earn this year.</p><h3 id="publish-a-course-or-book">Publish a course or book<a href="#publish-a-course-or-book" arialabel="Anchor"> 🔗︎</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Result</strong>: I’m about 80% done with my book.</li><li><strong>Grade</strong>: C</li></ul><p>Okay, okay! I didn’t finish the book!
