    <h1>Tell HN: Brother printers now locking out non-OEM paraphernalia</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>I recently bought a Brother colour laser printer, with the understanding that OEM toner was not chip-locked.<p>Wanting to update the firmware, and being on Linux, I started to look at ways to do it manually.</p><p>After finding a few guides to do so manually:</p><p>https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CUPS/Printer-specific_problems#Updating_the_firmware
https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2015/11/updating-hl3040cn-firmware.html</p><p>I decided to poll my printer.  I then noticed an OSS/python project to just handle it via a package.  However, I noticed this issue:</p><p>https://github.com/sedrubal/brother_printer_fwupd/issues/9</p><p>Startled, I Googled... and the printer listed is an inkjet.  For a second I was relieved, but then started to search for other issues, and found this:</p><p>https://www.reddit.com/r/printers/comments/s9b2eg/brother_mfc_firmware_update_nongenuine_toner_now/</p><p>Not only is the above, post-sale firwmware update a change of what I understood to be Brother&#39;s historical policy, the <i>method</i> is beyond evil.</p><p>Brother seems to be apparently accepting the ink, but then <i>purposefully</i> making the print quality poorer.</p><p>I literally cannot think of something, product wise, more evil.  It&#39;s one thing to say &#34;We refuse to use 3rd party toner&#34;, and another to <i>accept</i> the toner, and then just purposefully print like garbage.</p><p>I was a happy HP customer for years, and only switched to Brother (which, by all accounts, is a much smaller / less renowned company) for the sole reason to not be vendor locked.</p><p>I will likely return this printer, but thought HN should know what Brother seems to be up to.</p></td></div></div>
