<hr/>

<p>6 months ago, I started building Cartesian Tutor to explore AI tutors
as the future of education. It’s been an incredibly rewarding journey
and despite the lack of commercial success, I’ve learned a tremendous
amount. A++ experience, highly recommended.</p>
<p>I’ll be job searching over the next few months. If you are looking
for an AI-pilled staff software engineer with deep expertise in ML and
LLMs who is also capable of fullstack prototyping and thinking
holistically about product/technology/strategy, let me know. My search
pipeline is currently underindexed on Boston-area / remote jobs, so
these are especially welcome.</p>
<p>I’m happy to keep Cartesian Tutor up and running for students’ sake,
and as a continuing hobby project.</p>
<p>In this essay, I’ll do a light postmortem and talk about what went
well, what went poorly, and how I would do things differently next
time.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-built">What I built</h2>
<p>Cartesian Tutor scales 1-on-1 tutoring with AI.</p>
<p>Education is due for a change. The standard classroom model has many
weaknesses: too many students to have dedicated 1:1 time for each
student, too few students to achieve economies of scale in producing
quality content, and enough variation in ability that the entire class
moves at the pace of its 25%ile student.</p>
<p>Textbooks and YouTube creators set the bar for scalability. 1:1
tutoring sets the bar for effectiveness. Could we have both with AI
tutors?</p>
<p>Let’s look at why tutors are so effective. A tutor builds a mental
model of their student: thinking style, misconceptions, knowledge gaps,
working habits, and more. Using this mental model, the human tutor plans
and delivers the specific lesson that most rapidly brings the student to
mastery. Broken down as subtasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>inspect and debug the student’s thought process by asking carefully
crafted questions</li>
<li>design curriculum and lesson plans</li>
<li>create, maintain, incrementally update a model of the students’
knowledge set</li>
<li>deliver a lesson through some mix of didactic and Socratic
instruction.</li>
<li>(for high school students and younger) interface with the parent to
align on goals and to do some light family therapy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Socratic method built into <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/study_mode">ChatGPT’s
Study Mode</a> is but one tiny step in this direction. I found that LLMs
were not particularly good at any of the other subtasks. (That hasn’t
stopped a number of AI education companies from pushing slop generation
products to teachers…)</p>
<p>Cartesian Tutor uses a mix of AI-delivered lessons/problem review
with traditional software and hand-curated curriculum, practice tests,
and lesson plans, and the result seems to work decently. An especially
important ingredient here is human exam-writers’ taste in writing good
questions that can’t just be solved by pattern matching/plug-and-chug.
Students’ failed attempts at solving these olympiad questions create a
trail that AI can follow to diagnose students’ weaknesses.</p>
<p>In addition to this core product offering, I also built:</p>
<ul>
<li>User acquisition funnels.</li>
<li>Content scraping/generation/management system built around a hybrid
AI/human review workflow.</li>
<li>Engineering infra for rapid iteration + deployment of changes.</li>
<li>Logging, billing, product analytics integrations to figure out how
users were using my product.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-give-up">Why give up?</h2>
<p>When I started, I and many other people believed that there was some
nonzero chance that AI would quickly overtake many job descriptions,
empowering small teams to compete toe-to-toe with larger incumbents by
leveraging AI agents. I tried my hand at setting up an AI council to
dispense startup advice; using AI tools to generate marketing copy;
using AI tools to vibecode my frontend. None of this panned out. I
believe now that most jobs are safe, and “startup founder” the safest of
all, given how much adaptability, taste, and judgment it demands.</p>
<p>So, what should we make of the many recent examples of highly
successful AI-centric startups, all of which have shown unprecedented
growth rates and revenue numbers? VCs would love to spin the narrative
that “AI changes everything”, but I attribute this wave of hypergrowth
startups to a different combination of factors:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>tumult of mass layoffs pushing many potential founders to pull the
trigger on doing a startup.</li>
<li>end of ZIRP encouraging a focus on revenue growth over headcount
growth.</li>
<li>a flood of AI investment from VCs as well as traditional companies
<em>all</em> throwing 1-2% of their budget at AI experiments. Some
subset of those AI experiments are now panning out, leading to a
doubling-down of investment.</li>
</ol>
<p>So fundamentally, I am heading back into the job market because my
assessment is that I can create (and capture) the most value by working
as an AI specialist employee at one of these highly successful
AI-centric companies, rather than as a generalist startup founder.</p>
<p>That being said, I think it is highly likely that I will try another
startup in the future. Hence, the notes.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-would-change-for-my-next-startup">Things I would change
for my next startup</h2>
<h3 id="focus">Focus</h3>
<p>My efforts over these past 6 months were split between:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>building a successful business</li>
<li>putting AI through its paces and learning its strengths and
weaknesses</li>
<li>learning how to build a company</li>
</ol>
<p>While I failed at my first goal, I made amazing progress on the
second and third goals. I don’t regret learning about AI or building
companies, but next time will be a clear focus on building a successful
business.</p>
<p>I also spent some time consulting for another ed tech company, which
generated some revenue, helped sharpen my consulting skills, and helped
me see a very different way of working with Claude – but ultimately I
think this was just another distraction I could do without next
time.</p>
<h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
<p>I originally thought it would be a waste of money to go for a
coworking subscription when I had a nice WFH setup, but in retrospect it
would have been a good idea. My most productive times were in busy
coffeeshop environments, even if I was missing my split
keyboard/widescreen monitor.</p>
<p>Physical health could have used more attention. My previous daily
routine included a bike ride into the office, and without that, I found
my physical fitness gradually dropping, until I suffered some sort of
acute lower back injury. I’ve recovered and am doing more yoga to help
strengthen my core.</p>
<h3 id="fortuitous-encounters">Fortuitous encounters</h3>
<p>Overall, I was surprised at how often much I enjoyed random meetings
with old and new friends. Part of this was undoubtedly the social
isolation that comes with being a solo founder. I also found the
conversations helpful in refining and developing ideas for my startup.
This time, I spent ~2% of my time meeting people, and next time I think
I should spend more like 5-10% meeting people. As a Boston-based
founder, the base rate of fortuitous encounters is a lot lower, so it’s
worth being deliberate about finding and chatting with people.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-wouldnt-change">Things I wouldn’t change</h2>
<h3 id="blogging">Blogging</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/tags/cartesian_tutor/">weekly blogging thing</a>
was honestly great. It helped me sort through the zillion thoughts that
were running through my head and set weekly goals for myself.
Community-wise, many people I chatted with had read many or all of my
updates. It sparked many good conversations, and at a time when so many
people are looking for informed takes on where AI is going, it was a
great way to build some reputational currency.</p>
<h3 id="flex-days-and-working-pace">Flex days and working pace</h3>
<p>I worked roughly 30-50 hours/week during this startup period. Looking
at the pattern of my work hours, I found myself working in extremely
productive 2-4 hour bursts, followed by a few hours after to recover. I
found the following times particularly productive</p>
<ul>
<li>5-8AM before the family was really up and about.</li>
<li>10AM-1PM on weekdays, when I was fresh.</li>
<li>4-6PM on weekdays after I had recovered from the morning
sprint.</li>
<li>10AM-2PM on weekends if I felt the itch to keep on building.</li>
<li>more rarely, 9-11PM, after family went to bed and I had showered and
had lots of interesting shower thoughts/ideas on what to build.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given how little overlap there is here with a traditional 9-5 working
schedule. I’ll have to think about how I can create these optimal
conditions in my next job.</p>
<p>I also took many opportunistic hiking trips to New Hampshire when the
weather was particularly nice. I never regretted this, as I got to spend
quality time with family and found it refreshing enough that I easily
made up the missed time on the next day.</p>
<p>There were also many days when I found myself extremely unproductive,
or procrastinating on some specific thing that I was dreading doing. For
these days, just getting started was the most important thing, and I
often found that spark by asking Claude to do it for me. Still, many
other days went by where I actually did manage to procrastinate the
whole day. Those days, you just have to accept that there’s something
else on your mind, write off that day, and just let your mind chew on
whatever it’s chewing on.</p>
<h2 id="startup-learnings">Startup learnings</h2>
<ul>
<li>Find your first customer/user, even before you have a product. It is
the business equivalent of writing your tests/specs before writing the
code. I don’t think I would use the “build vaporware marketing/landing
pages until somebody clicks through and asks where the product is”
strategy, but I have renewed appreciation for how to-the-point it
is.</li>
<li>You really can’t underinstrument your app/website. Even something as
simple as knowing “which menu item do they click first upon landing on
your site?” is a hint at what they find most intriguing or
valuable.</li>
<li>Relatedly - run surveys as part of onboarding. These surveys are so
important in figuring out why somebody found you and what they want out
of your product.</li>
<li>A buffet of features is what happens when you have enough users that
you are your own distribution channel, and upselling is worthwhile.
Until you hit that point, you are searching for the one feature that
users must have, that they will abandon their existing solutions for.
Don’t cargo-cult larger companies with established product suites.</li>
<li>Find the right mix between low-cost experimentation and polished
product development. Better to showcase your best feature than to
overwhelm with many mediocre features.</li>
<li>Do things that don’t scale. Even if the premise of Cartesian Tutor
was “scale myself with AI”, I should have manually tutored some number
of students, just to get a visceral sense for what they are struggling
with on a day-to-day basis and what they need in terms of
software/tutoring/lesson support.</li>
<li>When optimizing for SEO, study competitors to figure out what their
recurring new customer funnels are. For example, one competitor in
Cartesian Tutor’s space offers brand-new practice olympiad exams every
year, and this ends up as a recurring source of new students who are
looking for practice olympiads.</li>
</ul>
