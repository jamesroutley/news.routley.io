    <h1>Tell HN: I think there are major issues with Google –&gt; Squarespace domains</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>As I’m sure everyone is aware by now, Google domains was sold to SquareSpace domains and the migration has been under way for a few months.</p><p>I build sites for clients and have noticed that domains that were transferred to SquareSpace are having serious issues with DNS settings updating/propagating.</p><p>Multiple times this week (and for completely different accounts) I’ve updated DNS records in SquareSpace domains dashboard only for nothing to update nor propagate around the web. These domains all use SquareSpace’s nameservers.</p><p>Reaching out to support is a nightmare because their agents are simply trained to say “you need to wait 72 hours” (which, I get is technically the limit but every other registrar I’ve worked with propagates settings within minutes or hours), and after 72 hours has passed with no update, they’ve simply stopped replying to me. Which, I’m assuming they’re tracking down some system wide  issues. Also they do not let you edit the TTL of records</p><p>All this to say, if you had domains on Google and simply let the migration go ahead - I’d recommend moving your domains off SquareSpace asap.</p></div></div></div>
