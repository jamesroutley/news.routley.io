        <p>We were recently notified by a reader that [Tom Evans] had filed a copyright claim against [Mark]’s repair video on his <em>Mend it Mark</em> YouTube channel, taking down said repair video as well as [Mark]’s delightful commentary. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPIrCaeVtvI" target="_blank">new video, [Mark] comments</a> on this takedown and the implications. The biggest question is what exactly was copyrighted in the original video, which was tough because YouTube refused to pass on [Mark]’s questions or provide further details.</p>
<p>In this new video the entire repair is summarized once again using props instead of the actual pre-amp, which you can still catch a glimpse of in <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/11/14/repairing-the-questionable-25000-tom-evans-audiophile-pre-amp/">our earlier coverage</a> of the repair. To summarize, there was one bad tantalum capacitor that caused issues for one channel, and the insides of this twenty-five thousand quid pre-amp looks like an artistic interpretation of a Jenga tower using PCBs. We hope that this new video does stay safe from further copyright strikes from an oddly vengeful manufacturer after said manufacturer event sent the defective unit to [Mark] for a repair challenge.</p>
<p>Since this purportedly ‘audiophile-level’ pre-amplifier uses no special circuits or filtering – just carefully matched opamps – this is one of those copyright strike cases that leave you scratching your head.</p>
