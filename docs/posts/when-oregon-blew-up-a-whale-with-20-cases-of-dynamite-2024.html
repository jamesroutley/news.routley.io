    <h1>When Oregon blew up a whale with 20 cases of dynamite (2024)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tuesday, November 12  denotes a remarkable day in Oregon history: 54 years since a dead whale was infamously blown up on a Florence beach, showering bystanders and cars with whale bits - and capturing the hearts and minds of the public. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6CLumsir34" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6CLumsir34">KATU was there live</a> to film the whole strange story.</p><p>On November 9, 1970, a dead sperm whale washed ashore on a beach in Florence.</p><p> Oregon&#39;s Highway Division decided to remove the whale using a dynamite explosion, assuming the 8-ton carcass would be disintegrated into small enough bits for scavenger species to eat.</p><p> And on November 12, 1970, that dead whale <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6CLumsir34" target="_blank" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6CLumsir34">exploded into history</a> with what has been described as the first-ever viral news story.</p><p>Crowds gathered on the beach to watch, including entire families with excited children. Among the spectators were former KATU reporter Paul Linnman and photojournalist Doug Brazil, recording the event for KATU News.</p><p>The dynamite was rigged.</p><p><a href="https://katu.com/news/local/exploding-whale-turns-50-should-a-whale-ever-was-ashore-in-lane-county-again#" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/local/exploding-whale-turns-50-should-a-whale-ever-was-ashore-in-lane-county-again#"><strong>PREVIOUS COVERAGE: </strong>Exploding whale turns 50: &#39;Should a whale ever wash ashore in Lane County again ...&#39;</a></p><p>Kelly Umenhofer witnessed the event as a 14-year-old. He shared his story with us in 2015.</p><p>&#34;So I&#39;m all excited, and I went over to my dad: &#39;They&#39;re going to blow it up, 20 cases of dynamite,&#39; and my father proceeded to say, &#39;I think you misheard them. I think he said 20 sticks,&#34;&#39; Umenhofer recalled in 2015. &#34;And I said, &#39;No he said 20 cases.&#39;&#34;</p><p>It was indeed 20 cases of dynamite.</p><p>Boom.</p><p>&#34;After they blew it up, everyone is watching in awe, and then 30 seconds later - blam blam blam - then everyone&#39;s going, &#39;There&#39;s huge chunks of whale blubber getting thrown on us,&#39;&#34; Umenhofer said.</p><p>John Barnes was 18 the day they blew up the whale, and recalled the same morbidly mesmerizing scene. </p><p><a href="https://katu.com/news/local/florence-locals-celebrate-50th-anniversary-of-exploding-whale-11-15-2020#" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/local/florence-locals-celebrate-50th-anniversary-of-exploding-whale-11-15-2020#"><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> Florence locals celebrate 50th anniversary of &#39;exploding whale&#39;</a></p><p>&#34;It was like a party,&#34; Barnes said. &#34;People are going &#39;hey hey hey&#39; and then they started the countdown 10, 9, 8, 7, 6.&#34;</p><p>Then, the whale exploded.</p><p>&#34;Ohh! And so you could see it coming down. But it wasn&#39;t just chunks, it was like a heavy mist,&#34; Barnes said. &#34;Kinda like this right now what we&#39;re getting right now. But it was whale goo that was coming down.&#34;</p><p>Rather than being blown out to sea as planned, whale guts rained down over bystanders, including Barnes.</p><p>One chunk of airborne blubber proved so big it flattened a car - a car that Kelly Umenhofer&#39;s father had just bought. </p><p>&#34;As it started to come down, it went boom!&#34; Umenhofer recalled in 2015. &#34;It almost bent the car in a V, and my dad goes, &#39;My car!&#39;</p><p>The entire time, KATU&#39;s Paul Linnmann narrated the spectacular - and spectacularly gross - scene. </p><p>&#34;The blast blasted blubber beyond all believable bounds,&#34; Linnmann said in the now-infamous report</p><blockquote>&#34;It might be concluded that should a whale ever was ashore in Lane County again,&#34; he continued, &#34;those in charge will not only remember what to do, they&#39;ll certainly remember what not to do.&#34;</blockquote><p>Even if Oregon has followed that advice, the Exploding Whale of Florence has become a beloved and memetic legend of both the town and the state as a whole. </p><p>Ranging from a Sufjan Stevens song to an Exploding Whale Pale Ale, shoutouts and tributes to the dead cetacean are regularly found throughout Oregon. </p><p>The KATU video of the original explosion newscast has accumulated tens of millions of views. </p><p>In 2022, the<a href="https://katu.com/news/local/once-again-katu-crew-captures-exploding-whale-during-portland-pickles-commemoration#" target="_blank" title="https://katu.com/news/local/once-again-katu-crew-captures-exploding-whale-during-portland-pickles-commemoration#"> Portland Pickles baseball team </a>held a tribute to the animal by blowing up a huge cardboard  whale during one of their games.</p><p>On the 50th anniversary of the explosion, community members and visitors gathered in Florence for a celebration featuring themed artwork, t-shirts, and even an exploding whale quiz.</p><p>There was even a memorial for the whale. People brought letters and mementos, and at the end of the celebration they were collected and made into a time capsule.</p><p>Aside from the 50th celebration, a bonafide yearly local holiday has sprung up around the city&#39;s &#34;official unofficial mascot&#34; in Florence. <a href="https://www.xplodingwhale.com/" target="_blank" title="https://www.xplodingwhale.com/">Visitors can view art, walk a &#34;Whale Trail,&#34; and visit the local history museum to see bone fragments recovered from the whale goo. Wearing &#34;whaley fun costumes&#34; is highly encouraged.</a></p><p>While state agencies have certainly remembered &#34;what to do and what not to do&#34; (these days beached whales are buried or left to decay naturally,) the whale itself made an explosive impact in the communal memory.  </p><p>Over half a century later, our over-the-top, slightly morbid, and ever-so-strange Exploding Whale lives on as a symbol for our wild and weird state. </p></div></div>
