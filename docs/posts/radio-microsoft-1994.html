The longest call wait-time is now at 2 minutes, 15 seconds.&#34;</p><p>&gt;&gt; &#34;Two customers in the Word for Mac group are awaiting assistance. The longest call wait-time is 1 minute, 15 seconds.&#34;</p><p>&gt;&gt; &#34;One customer is waiting for the DOS group. Your hold time is 3 minutes, 45 seconds.&#34;</p><p>Between these announcements, the DJ spins tunes, offers biographical details about the bands (many of which are local), and chatters about Seattle weather.</p><p>Although such a customer support system might seem like technological overkill, it sure beats &#34;Abort, Retry, Ignore?&#34;</p><p>- Simson L.
