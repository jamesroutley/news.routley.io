<p>Safety is at the core of our design and engineering decisions. In 2021, we began our transition to Tesla Vision by removing radar from Model 3 and Model Y, followed by Model S and Model X in 2022. Today, in most regions around the globe, these vehicles now rely on Tesla Vision, our camera-based Autopilot system.</p>

<p>Since launch, we have continued to make incremental improvements in both feature parity and safety. Compared to radar-equipped vehicles, Model 3 and Model Y with Tesla Vision have either maintained or improved their active safety ratings in the US and Europe, and perform better in pedestrian automatic emergency braking (AEB) intervention.</p>

<p>Today, we are taking the next step in Tesla Vision by removing ultrasonic sensors (USS) from Model 3 and Model Y. We will continue this rollout with Model 3 and Model Y, globally, over the next few months, followed by Model S and Model X in 2023.</p>

<p>Along with the removal of USS, we have simultaneously launched our vision-based occupancy network – currently used in Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta – to replace the inputs generated by USS. With today’s software, this approach gives Autopilot high-definition spatial positioning, longer range visibility and ability to identify and differentiate between objects. As with many Tesla features, our occupancy network will continue to improve rapidly over time.</p>

<p>For a short period of time during this transition, Tesla Vision vehicles that are not equipped with USS will be delivered with some features temporarily limited or inactive, including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Park Assist: alerts you of surrounding objects when the vehicle is traveling &lt;5 mph.</li>
    <li>Autopark: automatically maneuvers into parallel or perpendicular parking spaces.</li>
    <li>Summon: manually moves your vehicle forward or in reverse via the Tesla app.</li>
    <li>Smart Summon: navigates your vehicle to your location or location of your choice via the Tesla app.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the near future, once these features achieve performance parity to today’s vehicles, they will be restored via a series of over-the-air software updates. All other available Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving capability features will be active at delivery, depending on order configuration.</p>

<p>Given the incremental improvements already achieved with Tesla Vision, and our roadmap of future Autopilot improvements and abilities, we are confident that this is the best strategy for the future of Autopilot and the safety of our customers.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>How do I know if my vehicle is equipped with ultrasonic sensors?</strong></p>

<p>We will continue this rollout with Model 3 and Model Y, globally, over the coming months, followed by Model S and Model X in 2023.</p>

<p>If you have taken delivery of your vehicle and are curious if your vehicle is equipped with USS, the 12 sensors can be found on the front and rear bumpers of your vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Does the transition to Tesla Vision without ultrasonic sensors affect Model 3 and Model Y safety ratings for vehicles delivered on or after October 2022?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Will vehicles equipped with ultrasonic sensors have their functionality removed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Does the transition to Tesla Vision affect the availability of some features on vehicles delivered on or after October 2022?</strong></p>

<p><sup>*</sup>Features listed are reflective of availability in North America. Features vary based on region and purchased Autopilot package.</p>
<p><sup>†</sup>Autosteer maintains its 85 mph top speed, which is the same as Tesla Vision vehicles equipped with USS.</p>

<p>In the near future, once these features achieve performance parity to today’s vehicles, they will be restored via a series of over-the-air software updates.</p>
