<p>Iâ€™ve tried Notion, Obsidian, Things, Apple Reminders, Apple Notes, <a href="https://jotter.space/">Jotter</a> and endless other tools to keep me organised and sure, Notion has stuck around the most because we use it for client stuff, but for todo lists, all of the above are <em>way too complicated.</em></p>
<p>Iâ€™ve given up this week and gone back to paper and a pencil and I feel unbelievably organised and flexible, day-to-day. Itâ€™s because itâ€™s <strong>simple</strong>. Thereâ€™s nothing fancy. No fancy pen or anything like that either. Just a notebook and a pencil.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m in an ultra busy period right now so for future me when you inevitably get back to this situation: just. use. fucking. paper.</p>
