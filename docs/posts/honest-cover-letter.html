<p><small>My brain is telling me that if I can still laugh about this, it means I haven&#39;t been applying
to enough jobs. My brain and I don&#39;t really talk.</small></p>
<h2 id="honest-cover-letter"><a href="#honest-cover-letter" aria-label="Anchor link for: honest-cover-letter">§</a>Honest cover letter</h2>
<p>To the hiring manager at StartuplyAI,</p>
<p>I am writing to express interest in the opening you have posted for a Senior Full Stack Engineer (Client Experience). I think this opportunity would be a great fit for me, because I have read the job description, and, honestly, I think I could do a lot worse. You&#39;ve probably seen what things look like out there.</p>
<p>I see that most of your stack is Go. I don&#39;t have any real experience with Go, other than getting mad at Rob Pike for hating on syntax highlighting, but I am intellectually curious, and always strive to pick up new technologies. Plus, Go was designed to be easily taught to recent college grads who might still think that being a software engineer requires them to know how to balance a binary tree or find the shortest path through the graph, and we all know the only thing we need to balance is the intra-company politics while finding the shortest path through yet another stakeholder meeting, so how hard can learning this language possibly be?</p>
<p>In addition, I am prepared to set aside my principles, and learn — &#34;learn&#34; — how to use whatever AI tools are popular with your team, so that I can vibe code any and all amount of the stack, and I do mean all. My conscience was opposed to that, but I told it to try paying my bills, and it didn&#39;t have a good come back. My brain might start having notions about AI leading to the collapse of our industry, and possibly the world, but definitely not until I&#39;m a few paychecks in. It turns out my morals and personal values want to have a place to live, too. You&#39;ve probably seen what things look like out there.</p>
<p>I appreciate that this job is fully remote — remember when that was, like, all of them? I don&#39;t either, it&#39;s been a minute. Being able to work from home, or another environment of my choice, allows me the flexibility to not have to sit in my headphones all day, by myself, in a dark conference room, so that I can actually get through whatever it is I need to do. This way, I can also continue supporting mass transit in spirit, rather than by having to put myself on the bus and the train, where there are people.</p>
<p>I have been praised for high productivity in my previous roles, although that one time, they might have confused me with a co-worker, and I almost said something before I didn&#39;t. Actually, it might have been more than once. (I still haven&#39;t found a way to apologise to Sven that they promoted me instead of him). But I have been productive at crucial moments in my previous positions, because I managed to pull something out at hour eleven before the deadline, after spending the bulk of the previous two weeks in escapist fantasy. That&#39;s just my process, and I trust that StartuplyAI doesn&#39;t hire micromanagers who ask &#34;How it&#39;s going&#34; on a regular basis, or pick on me when I tell a joke instead of giving a real update during weekly standup. Wait, you do standup daily? Jesus Christ, that&#39;s a lot of jokes. But I am excited to grow into that role.</p>
<p>I have maybe three good hours of real work in me per day, maybe, and that should be divided in half for every meeting, or, honestly, any interaction where I can&#39;t provide a canned response — and that&#39;s on a good day. It&#39;s also if I at least kind of find my work interesting. If I don&#39;t find it interesting? I have no doubt that all the work that you do at StartuplyAI will be interesting if I am on the project. You may one day discover that key parts of our stack are now written in Rust, not Go (wouldn&#39;t that be interesting?), and that we generously contribute to open source projects with a handful of stars on GitHub. I will clear it with you ahead of time, of course, after the work had been underway for several months.</p>
<p>If it&#39;s not a good day, you will see much more of me on Slack (and I do mean Slack, it had better not be Teams), to make sure I at least show up as being online the whole day. If I respond to a message within 30 seconds, and sound positive and enthusiastic, it is definitely not a good day.</p>
<p>I noticed the job description mentions that your team uses test-driven development. I have to inform you that I, too, strictly adhere to test-driven development. If I am on your team, and my pull request gets held up in code review because I didn&#39;t include any tests, that was the test. You&#39;d be amazed how many of my previous teams have failed, again and again, despite the numerous chances I gave them to succeed.</p>
<p>Some other things, to make sure we all have the right expectations, and don&#39;t waste each other&#39;s time:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will need reasonable accommodations, as provided by law, to never be required to complete any forms (especially &#34;employee survey&#34; forms) that have non-optional freeform text inputs. I don&#39;t know who came up with those, or what it is that they think we all do here, but they ought to know that asking software engineers to submit open-ended writing assignments is like trying to run concurrent high-dimensional matrix operations, on millions of matrices, in pure Python. There are better tools for the job (I think they&#39;re all in Sales)</li>
<li>I&#39;m glad to see the team currently doesn&#39;t have an on-call rotation. I was about to come in citing how requiring engineers to do on-call violates the Geneva Conventions, or The Hague Charter, or maybe the Paris Accords, I don&#39;t remember, but it&#39;s one of those, and, anyway, it&#39;s not relevant, because you don&#39;t do on-call. If the leadership ever suggests &#34;exploring what a voluntary on-call rotation might look like&#34;, I will do my absolute best to send that exploration off the map by proposing the most byzantine, unworkable ways of implementing &#34;voluntary&#34; on-call, because both you and I know it&#39;s always voluntary until it&#39;s not</li>
<li>I know I probably can&#39;t get out of performance reviews (can I?), but I hope you at least don&#39;t do the thing where I&#39;d have to &#34;review&#34; my teammates or, worse, myself. On top of those things having a plethora of mandatory text inputs (as discussed above, no thank you), requiring employees to do this kind of thing is just plain weird. Someone recently told me that those so-called &#34;360 reviews&#34; are a best practice first pioneered by the KGB, and I don&#39;t need to fact-check it to believe it. Even when I briefly consider doing &#34;360 reviews&#34; honestly, the part of my brain that wants me to stay alive reminds me that snitches get stitches, and it does so with particular vigour when I am &#34;reviewing&#34; myself</li>
<li>If there is a regular meeting that regularly runs over its slot on the calendar, I may start to have regular unexpected problems with my Internet connection at around the time the meeting is supposed to end</li>
</ul>
<p>I am very excited for this opportunity, and to speak to you and the rest of the team. Honestly, when I first clicked on this job posting and saw that interviews at StartuplyAI have eleven rounds, I said &#34;what the fuck&#34; and immediately closed the tab. But then I dug through my history and found it again, because I have now seen enough other job postings to understand that in the current year, it is standard procedure to require prospective hires of pre-revenue startups to speak with the hiring manager, the lead engineer on the team, every other engineer on the team, the Head of Talent (is it okay if I mentally call them HR?), the CTO, the CEO, the CEO&#39;s brother, the CEO&#39;s brother&#39;s dog – a chow chow pitbull mix, I am genuinely excited for that one – and then the hiring manager again, so that I can see if I still remember their name, or my own. I&#39;m looking forward to getting to know the team throughout this process, while revealing the least I can get away with about my real self. If I ever feel like backing out, I will just look at my bank statement, and find the energy to keep going.</p>
<p>Please just let me know before you contact my references, so that I can &#34;remind&#34; them I &#34;worked&#34; with them at those &#34;companies&#34;, and apologise to Sven before I ask him to say he was my &#34;supervisor&#34;. I think he&#39;s gone back to Norway, or wherever he&#39;s from that has actual healthcare, so he can&#39;t be that mad. If anything, I helped him.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing back from you soon. My conscience wants to know when it can start harassing me again.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time,</p>
<p>Anna</p>
