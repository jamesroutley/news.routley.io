<p>Now, nearly a decade after Skyrim came out, the treasure fox myth is finally explained - and the truth is, it&#39;s sort of right, and sort of wrong.</p><p>Hot on the heels of 14-year Bethesda veteran - and now solo indie developer - Nate Purkeypile&#39;s wonderful development anecdote about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-08-17-during-development-skyrims-iconic-cart-ride-kept-getting-catapulted-into-space-by-a-bee">Skyrim&#39;s iconic cart ride getting catapulted into space by a bee</a>, fellow Bethesda veteran Joel Burgess, who worked on Skyrim as a level designer and now heads up Grindstone developer Capybara Games, took to <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelBurgess/status/1428008041887281157" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to detail the treasure fox.</p><p>As Burgess explains, shortly after Skyrim came out, the developers saw players report that if they followed foxes they would lead them to treasure. This wasn&#39;t intentional, so they investigated.</p><p>The explanation had to do with the way Skyrim&#39;s AI use &#39;navmesh&#39; for navigation. As Burgess says, navmesh &#34;is an invisible 3D sheet of polygons that is laid over the world, telling AI where it can and cannot go&#34;.</p><p>Foxes, which can only run away from the player,  use this navmesh for pathfinding, like all other AI in Skyrim.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In most situations, you&#39;re seeing AI decide what do to (run at player, hide in cover, etc), use navmesh to make a path, and navigate along that path.</p>— Joel Burgess (@JoelBurgess) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelBurgess/status/1428008060946194433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2021</a></blockquote>


<p>According to Burgess, much of Skyrim&#39;s world uses simple &#39;navmesh&#39;, because areas with basic topography, little clutter and a low chance of combat do not require lots of detail.</p><p>Essentially, Skyrim&#39;s wilderness requires a small number of big triangles when it comes to navmesh.</p><p>But a camp, for example, has more detailed navmesh because of the added visual detail. Essentially, as Burgess puts it, points of interest have a big number of small triangles.</p><p>Now we come to AI process. As Burgess explains, if you&#39;re close to an AI, it&#39;s in &#34;high process&#34; - &#34;or the most fancy, CPU-intensive pathfinding&#34;.</p><p>&#34;It uses the full navmesh and will do things like line-of-sight and distance checks.&#34;</p><p>A bandit attacking you, for example, &#34;is running nav stuff many times per second.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Low process&#34; is used for NPCs walking a trade route across the world, for example.</p><p>&#34;These are only updated every several minutes, and position is tracked very loosely,&#34; Burgess said.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To contrast, there&#39;s also &#34;Low Process&#34; - used for stuff like NPCs walking a trade route across the world. </p>— Joel Burgess (@JoelBurgess) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelBurgess/status/1428008064737742856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2021</a></blockquote>


<p>Skyrim&#39;s foxes, which are always fleeing, only ever use a &#34;medium process&#34;, which comes into play for characters nearby the player but who don&#39;t need the complex pathing of combat.</p><p>So, as Burgess puts it: &#34;The fox isn&#39;t trying to get 100 meters away - it&#39;s trying to get 100 *triangles* away.&#34;</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You see where this is going?</p>— Joel Burgess (@JoelBurgess) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelBurgess/status/1428008092218925059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2021</a></blockquote>


<p>Typically, camps and ruins and other points of interest are places in which it is easy for a fox to find 100 triangles. And the developers littered these places with treasure to reward exploration. Hence, the sense that foxes lead players to treasure.</p><p>&#34;So foxes aren&#39;t leading you to treasure - but the way they behave is leading them to areas that tend to HAVE treasure, because POIs w/loot have other attributes (lots of small navmesh triangles) that the foxes ARE pursuing,&#34; Burgess said.</p><p>&#34;To players, however, it&#39;s the same thing.&#34;</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s a nerdy little story, but I love it.  </p>— Joel Burgess (@JoelBurgess) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelBurgess/status/1428008102457139206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2021</a></blockquote>


<p>Burgess&#39; Skyrim treasure fox is another wonderful development anecdote from a game filled with such things, and shines a light on just how complex the virtual worlds we love so much can be.</p><p>Just need to know why Skyrim&#39;s dragons flew backwards, now!</p></section>
