    <h1>Ask HN: Fastest way to turn a Jupyter notebook into a website these days?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am mainly familiar with AWS but the configuration of S3, lambdas (including creating layers for python dependencies), api gateway, cloudfront, and all of the obscure permissions are just a major pain in the butt. I spent maybe 5 hours building something in Jupyter and then an entire day just dealing with AWS.</p><p>Is there an easier way? If I gave you a python script and some html what would you use to get it behind a www in the least amount of time possible?</p></div></div></div>
