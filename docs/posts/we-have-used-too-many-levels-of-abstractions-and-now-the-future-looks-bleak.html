<p><span id="description">A big percentage of so-called experts today only know how to configure some kind of hype-tool, but they understand nothing about how things work at the deeper level. This is a real challenge and a big problem for the future.</span></p>

<p>A steering wheel is an abstraction that makes it easier for me to drive my car. Power steering is yet another level of abstraction that further improves the driving experience. Abstractions are nice, they generally improve the quality of life. However, in Denmark we have a proverb that says:</p>

<blockquote>Too little and too much spoils everything.</blockquote>

<p>What good does an abstraction do when it breaks and nobody any longer understands how the technology under the hood works?</p>

<p>Everything in the tech industry is driven with a very hardcore eye for profit and very little interest in anything else. So you need to be able to push out new products or new services as fast as possible. This means more abstraction and more automation, less and less people, and less deeper understanding.</p>

<p>Today programmers and system administrators no longer exist, instead we have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> and even <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/DevSecOps">DevSecOps</a>, in which the industry is trying very hard to stuff every single task into the job description of a single individual. The tech guys needs to do development (Dev), security (Sec) and operations (Ops), i.e. system administration, but since no single individual can truly master all that, we need to automate as much as possible in order to save money and avoid the complexities of human social interaction between different tech departments. As a result, the modern tech person is only taught about how to use specific tools, he or she then knows very little about the technology under the hood.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t help that technology has become increasingly difficult to understand, but more and more of modern life depends heavily upon the tech we&#39;re using. So what is going to happen when the level of understanding in the tech industry reaches such a low point in which the majority of people don&#39;t even know how to fix the tools they are using?</p>

<p>People have become accustomed to the state of abstraction and they think it&#39;s the correct approach and they happily contribute to the mess by adding even more abstraction.</p>

<blockquote>Yes, let&#39;s all go back to coding in assembly!</blockquote>

<p>We need abstractions, no doubt about it, but every level of abstraction comes with a price which, ironically enough, eventually can cause a massive loss in profit.</p>

<p>Already now a majority of &#34;security people&#34; know very little about security and only about how to use some kind of pre-made penetration testing tool. The penetration testing tool shows a bunch of green lights in its web GUI board and all is assumed well. Yet, a real security expert with evil intentions has broken the system long ago and keeps selling valuable data on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet">darknet</a>. Nothing is leaked and nothing is discovered. This can go on for years without anyone finding out because, well, the GUI board says that all is <span>OK</span>.</p>

<h2>A simple case example</h2>

<p>One company I helped with security had used a third party developer firm who hired these exact types of people. The developers knew how to put together a website and an API using a &#34;modern framework&#34;, but did not understand much of the coding of the framework itself and nothing about security, and as soon as problems began occurring, nobody could figure out what was going on. They had actually been struggling with the situation for months before they finally decided to reach out for help.</p>

<p>It was clear, just by looking at how bad everything was performing, that something was wrong. I copied everything for offline scrutiny and went straight to the code of the system and spend an evening looking through lines of code, file by file, doing some simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">diffing</a> between some of the original framework files and the files running on the company host machines. Just looking through code and files.</p>

<p>Of course, it was not my intention to look through everything, but it is often surprising just how much you can learn from a bit of manual inspection. Often the truth lies just beneath the surface and with a little patience you can find it. This requires of course that you have more than just a basic understanding of how the technology works. Some students today apparently <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/21/09/27/2032200/students-dont-know-what-files-and-folders-are-professors-say">don&#39;t even know what files and folders are</a>?</p>

<p>Long story short, in the specific case, it turned out that they had been hacked and the system was being used as some kind of back-end distribution database for porn and other stuff. The performance problems was not caused by the hacking, but by the framework itself, which was horribly slow (no surprise there). The hacking was rather discrete and would most likely never had be discovered where it not because I decided to &#34;poke around&#34; and actually physically look at files and code.</p>

<h2>Advice to people studying technology</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Never just follow hype or trends.</li>
  <li>Be curious. Don&#39;t just learn tools, try to understand how the underlying technology works.</li>
  <li>If possible, try at least once to manually do what e.g. a configuration tool does for you.</li>
  <li>If possible, try to look at the code for the tool. Even a basic understanding of the code can be very valuable.</li>
  <li>Stay curious. Keep learning. Experiment. Dive deeper into the technology that interests you. If possible, set up a homelab and use it as a playground for learning and breaking things.</li>
  <li>Question everything. Especially things that don&#39;t make any sense to you. Don&#39;t just assume that someone else knows better - that&#39;s how you quickly turn into a blind follower. Sometimes someone else truly knows better, but don&#39;t just assume that to be the case by default. And be brave! Stand by the truth and your convictions even if that makes you feel like you stand alone.</li>
</ul>
