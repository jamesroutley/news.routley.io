    <h1>Inverted computer culture: A thought experiment</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<h3>A thought experiment</h3>
<p>Imagine a world where computers are inherently old. Whatever you do with
them is automatically seen as practice of an ancient and unchanging
tradition. Even though new discoveries do happen, they cannot dispel the
aura of oldness.</p>
<p>Most computers are located in ancient buildings, &#34;computer temples&#34;,
situated in tranquil natural environments. They stand unchanged over
centuries, like mountains, no matter what happens in the world around
them.</p>
<p>The idea of using computers in urban everyday life or for commercial
purposes is something that doesn&#39;t even occur to people&#39;s minds – that would
be just as absurd and wild as the idea of cleaning one&#39;s home with a
100-year-old tortoise.</p>
<p>Mundane mechanical technology has limited lifespans, a couple of decades
at most. Solid-state computer components, on the other hand, have no
mechanical decay, so they are practically eternal. An average microchip is
hundreds of years old and has thus seen many different uses in many
different eras. It is difficult to even look at a computer without admiring
the long history it has gathered within itself. Computers thus feel more
rooted to the world than any other human creation – despite the fact that
they have no practical use in the society.</p>
<p>Computing is something stereotypically practiced by old women. Someone
who is interested in computers is probably also interested in crocheting.
Men and youngsters who visit computer temples are considered oddballs by
their peers; young people in particular tend to see computers as something
profoundly anti-cool. Movements that try to rid computing of its
&#34;grandmotherly bias&#34; are usually seen as silly and embarrassing.</p>
<p>It is commonly thought to be futile to even try to make youngsters
interested in computers – they simply don&#39;t yet have the required patience
or concentration. There&#39;s no addictivity or instant gratification, nothing
flashy or punk that fascinates the young mind. The appreciation and
understanding of computers is something that develops slowly over years,
often via gateway interests such as meditation, cultural history or pure
mathematics. The kind of people who want to settle in a monastery and
dedicate their lives to science or art may also develop an interest in
computing.</p>
<p>The psychological effects of human-computer interaction are considered
similar to those of meditation: concentration, awareness, mental clarity.
Computers are also seen as amplifiers of wisdom and intelligence. However,
it may take years for a user to attain these effects, so those who are after
self-improvement are more likely to adopt more straightforward
practices.</p>
<p>It is considered essential to be in a properly alert and rested state of
mind when using a computer. Even to seasoned users, every session is
special, and the purpose of the session must be clear in mind before sitting
down. The outer world is often hurried and flashy, but computers provide a
&#34;sacred space&#34; for relaxing, slowing down and concentrating on a specific
idea without distractions. Breathing slows down, thought processes become
more wholesome and contemplative. People who have spent a lot of time in a
computer temple often find it difficult to readjust to the fast pace,
distractivity and intellectual one-dimensionality of the non-computer
world.</p>
<p>Computers are seldom privately owned – they are considered essentially
communal rather than personal – but their usage patterns are often highly
individualistic. Programming is the most essential element of all computer
use, and it is not uncommon to find users who have created all of their
software from scratch. Centuries of computer science research has valued
simplicity, elegance, smallness and clarity over mundane values such as
efficiency or scalability, so there are many beautiful ideas to base one&#39;s
individual programs on.</p>
<p>A small percentage of computer use consists of long-distance human
communication. The topics of non-technical discussion are often big and
timeless and seldom concern daily news events. Heated arguments and
polarization are considerably less common than in the non-computer &#34;world of
illusions&#34;.</p>
<p>There are computer games, but they are never framed as &#34;entertainment&#34;.
They are more often seen as learning experiences that help see the world
from different viewpoints. Children would find most of the games utterly
boring, if someone were crazy enough to try to get them interested.</p>
<p>Common people have all kinds of weird misconceptions about computing.
They often see computers as far more spiritual or even divine than they
actually are, so computer people often need to bring them down to earth from
their fantasies. Even though computers often do help improve minds, they do
not turn people into omniscient gods or saints or grant them eternal lives.
And the computers themselves aren&#39;t omniscient either, and cannot manipulate
the fabric of reality.</p>
