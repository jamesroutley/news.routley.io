                            ByteDance, one of the biggest tech companies in China is planning to lay off at least 10,000 people this year. The company faces many challenges, like an economic slowdown, unviable projects that became too expensive etc. They even had to cancel their IPO.

                <p>It seems that big tech companies based out of China will finally start facing the music of global tech layoffs. ByteDance, the owner of TikTok and one of the biggest tech companies in China is reportedly planning to lay off thousands of its workers in the coming months.</p>
<p>This news comes to us just days after ByteDance shut down its Indian offices and terminated all of its Indian staff. Although the Indian layoffs were majorly facilitated by ByteDance’s tussle with the Indian government, in China, the layoffs is taking place mainly due to an economic slowdown, dwindling growth and some wrong hedges the company had placed on a few of their projects.</p>
<p><strong>ByteDance’s reorganisation efforts</strong></p>
<p>By adjusting the timing of its objective-and-key-results (OKR) framework, ByteDance co-founder and CEO Liang Rubo stated that the Chinese tech unicorn expects to have more time “to reflect on truly meaningful progress” and “be more flexible” so that each business unit can “adjust its own cadence,” according to a report by the South China Morning Post.</p>
<p>What this effectively means, is that ByteDance will be streamlining its efforts and will be shutting down some projects that they think will not be viable in the short term. With projects being shut down, ByteDance will also start laying off a sizeable portion of its workforce of 1,00,000 employees. Various reports that have surfaced recently, quote an insider at ByteDance as saying that the company may lay off over 10,000 people by the second quarter of this year, if things don’t improve.</p>
<p><strong>A new direction</strong></p>
<p>ByteDance began layoffs impacting hundreds of staff at its virtual reality headset business Pico, after slashing hundreds of positions across several divisions at the end of 2022, as TikTok terminated its remaining employees in India.</p>
<p>ByteDance boss Liang told employees in December that the company needs to “get fit”, as it streamlines operations. That comment came months after CFO Julie Gao stated that the business had no plans to go public, after months of speculations that ByteDance would have their own IPO.</p>

<p>The new OKR review timetable also comes as ByteDance continues to into new areas.</p>

<p><strong>ByteDance’s tussle with Europe and the US</strong></p>
<p>TikTok has been trying desperately to pacify the EU that they are taking privacy seriously and will work closely with officials to safeguard users. TikTok risks getting banned in the EU as well as the US.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the US, ByteDance’s social media app has been slapped with a device and network-wide ban in a number of universities, and over 20 states have banned the social media platform and other ancillary apps from devices and networks that it maintains. Chew Shou Zi, the chief executive of TikTok, is expected to give testimony in the US Congress about the app’s operations in late March.</p>
