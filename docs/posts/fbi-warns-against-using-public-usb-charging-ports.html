Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead.&#34;</p><p>The FBI didn&#39;t respond to ABC News&#39; request for comment on whether there has been a rise in malicious activity related to the cyber-theft tactic known as &#34;juice jacking.&#34;</p><div><div data-testid="prism-inline-image"><figure data-testid="prism-figure"><img alt="PHOTO: People charge their electronics at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where outlets are available for travelers to plug in, Aug. 24, 2016." data-testid="prism-image" draggable="false" src="https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/charging-airport-gty-ps-230411_1681231045258_hpMain.jpg"/><figcaption><div data-testid="prism-caption"><p><span data-testid="prism-truncate"><span><span>People charge their electronics at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where outlets are available for travelers to plug in, Aug. 24, 2016.</span></span></span></p><p><span>CQ-Roll Call via Getty Images, FILE</span></p></div></figcaption></figure></div></div><p>Javed Ali, the former senior director for counterterrorism at the National Security Council, told ABC News that the information tweet was likely &#34;informed by an FBI-driven investigation or other intelligence that has now been approved for public release.&#34;</p><p>&#34;The tweet&#39;s message that public USB ports have been used by &#34;bad actors&#34; as points of origin to load malware or spyware on electronic devices connected to those public charging stations suggests a fairly high level of technical capability in order to carry out these operations,&#34; Ali, now an Associate Professor of Practice at the University of Michigan&#39;s Ford School of Public Policy said.</p><p>A 2021 <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.fcc.gov/juice-jacking-dangers-public-usb-charging-stations" target="_blank">alert</a> posted by the Federal Communications Commission warned that using a public charger could lead to malicious software on a device without the user&#39;s knowledge.</p><p>&#34;Cybersecurity experts have warned that criminals can load malware onto public USB charging stations to maliciously access electronic devices while they are being charged,&#34; the alert, initially posted around the holiday season warned. &#34;Malware installed through a dirty USB port can lock a device or export personal data and passwords directly to the perpetrator. Criminals can use that information to access online accounts or sell it to other bad actors.&#34;</p><p>While officials did not offer statistics about the prevalence of juice jacking, people have increasingly suffered from cyber-theft in recent years. Americans lost $10.3 billion to a wide variety of internet scams last year, <a data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/americans-lost-103-billion-internet-scams-2022-fbi/story?id=97832789" target="_blank">according to</a> an FBI report released last month.</p></article></div></div>
