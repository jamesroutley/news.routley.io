    <h1>Airplane acquired by Airtable and is shutting down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m excited to announce that Airplane is being acquired by <a href="https://www.airtable.com" rel="noreferrer"><u>Airtable</u></a>, an app building platform that connects teams through shared data.</p><p>We started Airplane to democratize access to software tooling, and we found Airtable to be a fantastic match to continue that mission. Over 450,000 organizations use Airtable and over 50% of the Fortune 500 are paying customers. Beyond just a highly aligned roadmap and vision, we found Airtable shared our culture of rapid iteration and a high bar for quality. The Airplane team will be joining Airtable and is excited to continue our mission at scale.</p><p>As part of this transition, we will unfortunately be sunsetting the Airplane platform on <strong>March 1</strong>. We’ve closed new signups, and existing users will be receiving an email with further details.</p><p>To all our users and customers: we are sincerely grateful for your interest, support, and feedback over the years. It’s been a pleasure and an honor to learn about, collaborate with, and assist your organizations.</p><p>I wish you all the best in the new year.</p></div></div>
