<p>San Francisco District 4 supervisor Gordon Mar <a href="https://twitter.com/D4GordonMar/status/1593036039605870593">conceded his
re-election
race</a> last
night, wishing luck to supervisor-elect Joel Engardio. Mar couldn’t
resist adding that, of voters within the previous D4 boundaries, a
majority continued to support him.</p>

<p>A spicy thing to say while conceding, perhaps, but true. As <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/11/election-2022-whats-it-all-about/">Joe Eskenazi
wrote</a>
on Monday,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there’s no point in denying that redistricting is the difference in
this race. Engardio’s home was grafted into District 4, along with
three precincts. He leads Mar by 490 votes, and he is +529 in those
three precincts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These aren’t just any three precincts. They’re the three most
conservative in all of San Francisco, voting 22%, 26%, and 26% for
Donald Trump in 2020, versus 12% citywide. By annotating a map
<a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2021/sf-progressive-voter-index/">published last year in the
Chronicle</a>
we can see that Mar, a progressive, would have stood much better
chances had his district instead, or additionally, been expanded east
to encompass the progressive-leaning Inner Sunset. This map was
approved by a slim 5–4 majority of the Redistricting Task Force
aligned with Mayor London Breed.</p>

The area just south of Sloat, north of Lake Merced, newly added to District 4 by mayoral appointees, is colored the least progressive color (0-10 on PVI scale). There was no expansion east into the Inner Sunset, which is much more progressive (from 38 to 87 on the PVI scale)."/>

<p>Such observations are upsetting to Andy Mullan and Mike Chen, who in
the <em>Chronicle</em> this week <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/openforum/article/election-san-francisco-redistricting-17587486.php">defend the
results</a>
of San Francisco’s chaotic redistricting process. Calling it
“Trump-like rhetoric” for progressives to say districts were
gerrymandered, they conclude:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Redistricting strengthened democracy in San Francisco. It addressed
our absurd and unequal population imbalances, and our city is better
for it. We can’t let anyone fault our democratic processes to
delegitimize election results they don’t like. Whether it’s from the
far right or the far left, it’s unacceptable for anyone to use “Stop
the Steal” rhetoric to undermine our democracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a pretty strong reaction to people merely noting that the new
districts were one factor in Engardio’s (and possibly D6 supervisor
Matt Dorsey’s) wins. Why might “moderate” supporters of the mayor,
Engardio, and Dorsey feel so defensive?</p>

<h2 id="i-had-brought-a-clipboard-to-a-knife-fight">“I had brought a clipboard to a knife fight”</h2>

<p>The reality is that a collegial, nonpartisan exercise in democracy
wasn’t what those of us watching the Redistricting Task Force
witnessed. Nor was it the experience of Task Force member Raynell
Cooper, whose statement beginning on page 36 of the task force’s
<a href="https://sf.gov/sites/default/files/2022-05/2021-2022%20San%20Francisco%20Redistricting%20Task%20Force%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf">final
report</a>
makes a compelling read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I applied to and was appointed to this Task Force at age 26, looking
for a way to get more involved in making San Francisco better
without getting too deep into the City’s notoriously toxic political
climate. I worked (and still work) as a planner for SFMTA, so I felt
like my energy would be best spent on this nonpartisan and
ostensibly nonpolitical body, where I could contribute my community
engagement skills and lifelong passion for maps without having to
ruffle too many feathers.</p>

  <p>I approached this process the same way I approach everything in my
career in the public sector: attempting to do what’s best for the
people while working within difficult and oftentimes frustrating
constraints. My understanding of the task at hand was that we were
to take in data and public feedback and discuss how to make the best
possible map based on those inputs, without consideration for the
desires of political interests unwilling to speak publicly about
what their intentions are and why.</p>

  <p>But it became clear to me in the final days of the process that I
had brought a clipboard to a knife fight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like many of us watching, Cooper initially had faith in the process.
He wanted, and expected, fair districts, not a factional gain for one
side or another. Yet in the end, he concluded that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the central decision of this map, removing Tenderloin from its
cross-Market neighbors in Central SOMA and moving it to District 5,
is not an appropriate adjustment based on public input.</p>

  <p>We heard virtually unanimous opinion from the residents of
Tenderloin, Central SOMA, and District 5 that the previous alignment
of those neighborhoods made sense. The Tenderloin community in
particular was consistent, persistent, and clear about their desire
to remain in the same district as SOMA. […]
It was profoundly disappointing to see the majority of my colleagues
make a decision that explicitly prioritized the desires of well-off
communities over the needs of the most underprivileged.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The map was required to equalize district populations, and
after a decade of
uneven development, that led to tough choices. Rather than
deliberate those choices honestly, openly and transparently, however,
a 5-person bloc of members aligned with Mayor London Breed
turned redistricting into a circus. Rapid-fire, dramatic changes were
made at the last minute by this slim majority, often with little
justification.</p>

<p>The task force’s worst move—splitting the long-connected Black
communities in Potrero Hill and Bayview—was later reversed, but
provides a stark illustration of gamesmanship for factional
advantage. Mayor-appointed member Matthew Castillon introduced the
change at 11:49pm on April 9th, <em>eleven minutes</em> before the soft deadline
for a substantially complete map. Task Force member Cooper, again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On April 9th, what seemed like a settled matter resurfaced out of
nowhere with a new motion to move Potrero Hill out of District 10
springing out of a convoluted series of edits as if it were just an
organic set of edits necessary to balance the numbers. That motion
would have put Potrero Hill in District 9, a new home for the
neighborhood that to that point had not been contemplated. It
failed, but after a hastily called recess the vote was reversed and
Potrero Hill was off to District 9 and the Portola added back [to]
District 10.</p>

  <p>Regardless of the merits of the move itself, blatant unfairness of
the proceedings led to myself and three other members walking out of
the meeting. It had become apparent to me earlier that day that not
all members of the Task Force were voting based solely on how their
own hearts or minds felt about the issues at hand and in that moment
it became apparent to everyone else. The issue of Potrero Hill and
the Portola was brought back to assuage outside political interests,
not due to any genuine change of heart by a member of the Task
Force. I was stunned by what I had just witnessed and knew that I
would be compromising my morals by remaining in that meeting that
evening.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/04/chair-of-redistricting-task-force-told-others-he-felt-mayors-pressure-in-voting-on-maps/">Will Jarrett’s excellent
reporting</a>
in Mission Local is full of shocking details about this vote, such as
that after a 1:30am recess for the members to “move our cars,” one
mayor-appointed member mysteriously flipped her vote, and the motion
went from failing to passing. Chair Rev. Arnold Townsend later agreed
that the map, which he had just voted for, represented “ethnic
suicide,” and admitted he was being leaned on by Mayor Breed to vote
against his conscience, writing in a text, “I have no choice.”</p>

<p>At the next meeting, I went to City Hall in person in solidarity with
Black San Franciscans from Potrero Hill and Bayview, listening to
their heartfelt testimonies for two hours before lining up to make my
own comment. No one who was in that room could have failed to be
affected by the overwhelming sense of injustice and of resistance.</p>

<p>The task force ultimately reverted its change to D10, but held firm on
splitting the Tenderloin from Central SoMa. That split had itself been
made suddenly after six months of meetings, only 20 days before the
deadline; had itself been denounced in <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2022/04/in-u-turn-task-force-approves-preliminary-district-map-that-keeps-tenderloin-in-district-6/">hours of near-unanimous public
comment</a>;
and had been reverted and un-reverted multiple times, including in a
surprise at the end of a marathon meeting at 2:53am, which drew
public outcry from no less than the <a href="https://sfgov.org/electionscommission/sites/default/files/Documents/meetings/2022/2022-04-08-commission/2022%2004%2006%20-%20Letter%20of%20Concern%20to%20Elections%20Commission%20re%20Redistricting%20Task%20Force.pdf">League of Women
Voters</a>—hardly
a “far right or far left” organization.</p>

<h2 id="the-influence-on-this-election">The influence on this election</h2>

<p>It’s worth emphasizing that gerrymanders are bad because they harm
communities, not because they help or hurt specific candidates. The
Tenderloin and Central SoMa are both poor neighborhoods with many
people living in SROs, are both unusually diverse for San Francisco,
and have noted histories as LGBTQ+ friendly neighborhoods, with the
Compton’s Transgender Cultural District spanning both. Honey Mahogany,
who is trans and a progressive, clearly would have had an easier time
campaigning within one of the draft maps that kept the Tenderloin and
Central SoMa together.</p>

<p>But the bigger issue is that, regardless of who won, both D6
candidates campaigned by running to the center. Not only did Dorsey,
as a former spokesperson for SFPD, unsurprisingly emphasize a
police-centered vision for public safety over issues faced by
affordable housing tenants and the trans community, but Mahogany
appeared to pivot her campaign in a “tough love”/”tough on crime”
direction as well. Regardless of which candidate won, their platform
and priorities would have been more tailored to appeal to the
wealthier, whiter, more cis and straight, new D6.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in district 4, the decision to avoid expanding into
Inner Sunset had another cost. It left district 4, which grew little
from 2010–2020, way under population. Districts are only supposed
to differ from equal population by up to 1%, but they can deviate by 5%
if that is the only way to keep recognized communities whole. The task
force abused this leeway, creating dramatic deviations across the
board even while <em>separating</em> the Transgender Cultural District
between 5 and 6 and the Sunset District between 4 and 7. Fully half of
the final districts exceed a 4% deviation:</p>

</tbody></table>

<p>The result of this is that if you live in Joel Engardio’s low-density,
semi-suburban neighborhood, where a quarter of voters opted to
re-elect Trump, your vote is 9.9% more powerful than that of a
Tenderloin resident. I had to double-check my math on that because
it’s such a dramatic difference, it’s hard to believe.</p>

<p>You almost have to admire the chutzpah, then, that when Andy Mullan
and Mike Chen write, “This attack on our local democracy is…
shameful,” they’re talking <em>not</em> about the redistricting that created
that disparity, but about <em>criticism of it</em>.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, unless someone sues and gets a court to
overturn this map, we’re stuck with it, and a win is a win. But we
don’t have to be happy about it, and we shouldn’t forget the injustice
that’s been done. No one has disputed that Mullan and Chen’s favored
candidates are the legal winners of their elections. But whether
Mullan and Chen like it or not, those wins will always have asterisks
next to them.</p>

<p>And several citywide results point in a more progressive direction.
Against the wishes of Mayor Breed, voters passed Prop H (even-year
elections) by a 42-point margin, 71%-29%. Voters passed Prop C
(homelessness oversight) and Prop M (empty homes tax) over
opposition both from Mayor Breed and from Chen’s Ed Lee Democratic Club. And
Prop J, affirming the car-free status of JFK Promenade, which had a
<a href="https://electionmapsf.com/correlations/">moderately strong negative
correlation</a> with support for
Joel Engardio, passed by 26 points, 63%-37%.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s why “moderate” supporters of the mayor are so sensitive
about their redistricting coup getting noticed: They know they won’t
be able to hold progressives back forever.</p>
