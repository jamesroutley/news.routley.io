    <p>my friend’s macbook’s battery blew up. see below.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.greg.technology/assets/macbook-goes-boom/internals1.jpg" alt="macbook blew up"/></p>

<p>using the serial number, I found out that it’s a “MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)”</p>

<p>running the number on the <a href="https://support.apple.com/15-inch-macbook-pro-battery-recall">15-inch MacBook Pro Battery Recall Program
</a> page returns “The serial number you entered may be eligible for this program.”</p>

<p>so… was this one of the very unlucky machines specifically targeted by the recall in which “the battery may overheat and pose a fire safety risk” (as the recall page says)?</p>

<p>there are two things I’d love to see happen:</p>
<ul>
  <li>it seems like the hard drive may be located by the speaker on the left – my friend would want to recover her data. is that possible?</li>
  <li>it seems like Apple should be replacing the laptop since it officially recalled these specific devices for this specific problem. right?</li>
</ul>

<p>contact me if you have leads/ideas – <a href="mailto:hi@greg.technology">hi@greg.technology</a></p>

<p>thanks!</p>

<p>p.s. other photos below, including the power adapter which is 1) a real Apple charger (not a 3rd party one) 2) shows no sign of wear/exposed cables, etc.!</p>
