    <p><em>This post is a recap of my recent experience job searching and a “thank you” for
all the help I received along the way.</em></p>

<p>I’m sure you’ve heard it before, and if not, it’s a common sentiment to
describe the amount of effort it takes to interview with multiple companies
when job searching.</p>

<p>I recently underwent this process for the first time, and I 100% agree with the
sentiment. Even though I have worked before, this is the first time I fully
went “all in” on job searching. My process was three weeks straight of
scheduling, interviewing, and following-up with 28 different companies.</p>

<p>Okay, I exaggerated a bit. I couldn’t have done this all myself, and the only
reason I was able to cast such a wide net was because I had help from the
<a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=bd78c8b557bd3fa6fb1a1e026cb63ddd">Recurse Center</a> career services. They made it really easy to get and
schedule phone screens, get advice, and stay organized when interviewing.</p>

<p>I think what really helped was their initial contact. Before ever talking with
a company, the career services would reach out to see if said company was
interested in a phone screen, with zero effort on my part. That’s huge and a
lot of work just to get a foothold! I have certainly put a lot of effort in the
past for a “cold” application to never make it to a call. Of the 28 companies I
was interested in, 16 of them declined without a phone screen. Again, zero
effort on my part which helped me retain my enthusiasm for interviewing.</p>

<p>Interviewing with the remaining 12, it was my responsibility to schedule and
maintain contact to move the process along. That’s definitely a full time job.
Fortunately fewer and fewer companies make it through the funnel as the
interviews progress. I think what helped me the most in this stage was knowing
what was important to me: culture, opportunities to learn and be creative, and
being in the security industry. Well, it’s important to know that in the phone
screens too, but I kept it in mind as I got to learn more about each company.</p>

<p>I won’t say how many offers I received, but it was non-zero and at that point I
don’t think I could have chosen wrong given my criteria (assuming, of course, I
had more than one offer to choose from).</p>

<p>So thank you <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=bd78c8b557bd3fa6fb1a1e026cb63ddd">Recurse Center</a> for helping me get a job! I couldn’t have done
it to such a large scale without your support and guidance, not to mention the
entire RC community who collectively helped me become a better programmer!</p>
