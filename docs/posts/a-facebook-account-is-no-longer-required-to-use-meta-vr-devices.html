As part of this shift, we’ve taken a step back to reflect on what account model would best support our work to help build the metaverse. <br/></p><p> Today we’re introducing Meta accounts: a new way for people to log into their VR headsets that doesn’t require a Facebook account. When we announced that we would start requiring people to log into Meta Quest using a Facebook account, we received a lot of feedback from the Quest community. We took that feedback into account as we designed a new Meta account structure that gives people flexibility and control. <br/></p><p><img src="https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/292558903_719194939191007_7429550652580796913_n.png?_nc_cat=105&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=nGyGdrbRH4wAX8CQ1UD&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&amp;oh=00_AT-6mKuLwH0XjZ1mLHt4v19ApPxGWF6ZNh3Cb4dVOFYgFw&amp;oe=62CBBF72" width="100%" alt=""/></p><p> Your Meta account lets you log into your VR devices and view and manage your purchased apps in one place—it’s not a social profile. Alongside Meta accounts, we’re also evolving your Oculus profile to a new Meta Horizon profile. This represents your social presence in VR and other surfaces where you use your Meta Horizon profile, like the web. With your Meta Horizon profile, you can choose how you appear to others by customizing your username, avatar, and other information.<br/></p><p> If you don’t want to use your Facebook and/or Instagram accounts in VR, that’s entirely up to you. Alternatively, adding your Meta account to the same <a href="https://www.oculus.com/lynx/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fprivacy-matters-accounts-center%2F&amp;e=AT0TuwdTbjIOT81y2dC6K4i1RAXzXhtPYX6w01p72IRFOD9Ki_sa-UDD79Pwjob1WoTKxLGuF1bT7_NpXt1VvM4mEf8oGYhYHEDCa80GEd7uttQOHytWkLmlFfRNLxsN5XeCeDUtkqsW7Ew" target="_blank">Accounts Center</a> as your Facebook or Instagram accounts unlocks connected experiences across Meta technologies, like finding your Instagram followers to play games with in VR or chatting with Facebook friends on Messenger. <br/></p><p> If you’re new to Meta VR devices or have previously merged your Oculus account with your Facebook account, you’ll need to create a Meta account and an accompanying Meta Horizon profile starting in August 2022. If you’ve been logging into your VR device with your Oculus account, you can continue to do so until January 1, 2023, at which point you’ll need to create a Meta account and Meta Horizon profile to continue using your Meta VR device.<br/></p><p> In the future, we’ll extend Meta account functionality so you can use it to log into other Meta devices.<br/></p><h3>Meta Accounts</h3><p>Meta accounts give people more choice when it comes to how they log into VR and whether Facebook and Instagram are part of their VR experience. Here’s how:<br/></p><ul><li><p>You can choose to access connected experiences with Facebook and Instagram in VR, like finding Instagram followers to play games with or using Messenger to chat with friends. You can do this in a few ways:</p></li><ul><li><p>If you’re a new Meta VR user, you can choose to set up your Meta account using Facebook or Instagram.</p></li><li><p>If you’re an existing Meta VR user, you can set up your Meta account using Facebook. If you’d like to enable connected experiences in VR with your Instagram account, you can do so in <a href="https://www.oculus.com/lynx/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fabout.fb.com%2Fnews%2F2020%2F09%2Fprivacy-matters-accounts-center%2F&amp;e=AT2hgwy1tWn1sW055xvaVsWEMnG1jkx0G4QUwmSkNwakC9vuTQ8AgfX1mAdZvmyMCWGUejewtz2R9DfxlJ4BBcTltBAVilCqkEKDGc4r4B1cwBAnYqJZqqRfV56jyZ3GivuYHSApZ3kCFM4" target="_blank">Accounts Center</a>—your one-stop shop to manage accounts and connected experiences (like syncing your various profiles) across Meta technologies. You’ll be able to find Accounts Center in Settings in the Oculus mobile app, on our website, and in-headset.</p></li><li><p>If you set up your Meta account with an email address, you can enable these connected experiences with Facebook and Instagram at any time in Accounts Center. For more, please visit our <a href="https://www.oculus.com/lynx/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.facebook.com%2Fhelp%2F1968670550009187%2F%3Fintern_source%3Dblog%26intern_content%3Dmeta-accounts&amp;e=AT39n3PjM0yQDXdffBShtllhY_g5T_3VOQNYVFeawicKJcikrOtjluyIIdHhXme7CdGv1T8oAhOvKBjAiMrmgLhZnpczyBi4bVCqhEA64KiR3HZhxxeKomfNY3LAsIWR9z7NYNVNXeIhmXU" target="_blank">Help Center</a>.</p></li></ul><li><p>If you previously merged your Oculus account with your Facebook account, you can choose to remove your Facebook account during the setup process. This keeps your Facebook account separate from your VR use.</p></li></ul><p> The information saved in your Meta account includes your name, email address, phone number, payment information, and date of birth so we can verify your age. You must be 13 years old or older (or 14 years old or older in Spain and South Korea) to create a Meta account. Your Meta account information isn’t public, and you can create multiple Meta accounts.<br/></p><p> If you already use Meta VR devices, the apps you’ve previously purchased will be available for you to access after you’ve created your Meta account, so you’ll be able to dive back into your games right away.

These changes apply to all countries where Quest devices are supported.<br/></p><h3>Meta Horizon Profile</h3><p> After you finish creating a Meta account, you’ll be prompted to create a Meta Horizon profile, which replaces your Oculus profile. Your Meta Horizon profile is your social profile in VR and other surfaces, like the web. You can customize how you appear to others—you can show up as a gamer or as your buttoned-up 9-to-5 persona. You can pick how you do and don’t appear to others by choosing your Meta Horizon profile username that’s unique to you (e.g. WarriorMama365), the profile name that will be displayed to others (e.g. Monique Smith), your profile photo, avatar, and more. You can create one Meta Horizon profile per Meta account. And if you choose to add your Facebook and/or Instagram accounts to the same Accounts Center as your Meta account, you can easily sync your profile information if you’d like to do so.<br/></p><p><img src="https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/292449525_822450712070739_4536893480912310170_n.png?_nc_cat=103&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=XVn0L6GPdQIAX8f1emR&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&amp;oh=00_AT-ziKKbAYUVFinFu3oe8d_liiUJZLoKcsLkupIhdmsQlA&amp;oe=62CCFAA2" width="100%" alt=""/></p><p> Also in August, we’re shifting our current “Friends” model to a new “Followers” structure, similar to what we currently offer on Instagram. This update provides more ways to be social and connect with others. You can choose whether to share your active status and activity updates, like the apps you own and your achievements, with your followers. If you already own a Meta VR headset, your Oculus friends will automatically become your followers and you’ll follow them back by default. You can choose to unfollow anyone or remove followers at any time. <br/></p><h3>Privacy Controls</h3><p> We want to let you control who you interact with in VR and build your own community. As part of this update, you’ll find a menu with three privacy options to help guide you through which privacy settings are the best fit for you: Open to Everyone, Friends and Family, and Solo. After you make your selection, you’ll have the opportunity to review and confirm your individual privacy settings are set the way you want them. You can change these settings at any time. <br/></p><p><img src="https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/292701304_450652239839495_2404573665545380294_n.gif?_nc_cat=106&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=ad8a9d&amp;_nc_ohc=y-p5gPGYpNEAX-4M5QB&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-sjc3-1.xx&amp;oh=00_AT82SwtjIHveio2zjumunc6dXRC_01jYtXxATLlsb5FwtA&amp;oe=62CB4884" width="100%" alt=""/></p><p> As part of these privacy settings, you have the option to set your Meta Horizon profile to private, which means you’ll be asked to review and approve follower requests. If you choose this option, only your followers can see who you follow and who follows you. Do keep in mind that non-followers will still be able to view your profile picture, avatar, username, display name, follower count, and the number of people you follow. People can also still search for your name or username and send you follow requests.<br/></p><p> People between the ages of 13 and 17 will have their Meta Horizon profiles set to private by default.<br/></p><h3>Supporting the Developer and Enterprise Communities</h3><p> Developers are at the heart of everything we do, and we want them to be able to continue building amazing games and experiences with a minimum amount of friction. While there’s no action for developers at this time, we wanted to give plenty of advance notice that these changes are coming.
