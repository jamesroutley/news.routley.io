<p>Software development has to be funded somehow.
Unfortunately, it is hard to sell software like physical products because it does not have the built-in copy protection that physical products have.
Any artificial copy protections added to software are ineffective if users should have full control of their own computers.
Therefore funding has to be done in a different way.</p>

<p>The existing methods of funding software have their problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay to download or for other services: Not worth it; users can find the software somewhere else and they don&#39;t need your other services.</li>
<li>Accepting donations: Why would you pay if you don&#39;t get anything for your money?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1Sub.dev</strong> tries to solve this by letting developers cooperate to give users more for their money.
The user subscribes to a developer of their choice and in return, all developers (and everyone else who wants to) can give that user some kind of benefit, like giving them access to downloads or other resources.
Simply, from the effort of subscribing to one, you get the benefit of subscribing to all.</p>

<p><a href="https://1sub.dev/about/how-it-works">Read more about how it works.</a></p>

<h2>Why this is better than the alternatives</h2>

<ul>
<li>You don&#39;t have to make separate payments for each program you use. Just subscribe to one developer and you get access to everything.</li>
<li>Do you need to use some software but you don&#39;t want to or can&#39;t give that developer money? Don&#39;t worry, you choose who you want to subscribe to. Nobody can see who you are subscribing to.</li>
<li>You are anonymous and this system doesn&#39;t handle any money, just the information about who is subscribing to who. Users are identified by an account number.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Are you a developer?</h2>

<p>We are looking for developers (companies or individuals) of Free and Open Source software who want to join this cooperation.
Are you one of them?
Do you believe in this solution?
You can contact me at 1sub@robalni.org and we can try to make it happen.</p>
