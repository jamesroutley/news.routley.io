If we don&#39;t grow, we aren&#39;t really living.&#34;</blockquote><hr/><p>After more than a year of using Fedora, I decided to switch back to <a href="https://voidlinux.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Void Linux</a>. This was all despite of <a href="https://bugwhisperer.dev/blog/stop-os-hopping">my bold proclamations</a> against doing just that not so long ago. Why?</p><p>It boils down a few simple things:</p><ol><li>Mostly, I had begun to long for a simpler system. One that I felt I could understand everything more fully.</li><li>Having become more comfortable with terminal-based ways of working, I was ready to let go of some of the GUI-based workflows and tools that I had used in the past. The overhead and complexity of the setups to support said GUI tools was no longer needed.</li><li>Switching my OS was an opportunity to rethink and re-evaluate other areas too.</li></ol><p>In the end, the switch was largely painless. Having a solid set of dotfiles and backup systems in place, it really came down to make an ISO, install the new OS, copy over home folder files &amp;dotfiles, and then reboot. The new system runs with less memory overhead and the CPU even seems to runs ~5-10C cooler on musl C and runit. Nice!</p><p>⁂</p><p>Maybe it’s part of getting older or from gaining more of that life XP goodness, but I’m less inclined take hard-line, absolute stances on things or at least feel more willing to sit with the murky reality of things to understand them better before forming an opinion. Shades of gray and nuance to things are OK.</p><p>Until next time, be well, take care of yourselves and help those around you! 🩷</p></div></div>
