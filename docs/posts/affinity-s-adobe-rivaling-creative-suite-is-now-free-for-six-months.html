    <h1>Affinity&#39;s Adobe-rivaling creative suite is now free for six months</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Design software developer Serif has launched a new six-month free trial for its Affinity creative suite, which is well regarded as being one of the few viable alternatives to Adobe’s professional design apps. <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/press/newsroom/try-affinity-designer-photo-and-publisher-free-for-six-months/">The offer</a> is available for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/9/23448945/affinity-version-2-adobe-creative-app-features-price">Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer, and Affinity Publisher</a> starting today on Mac, Windows PC, and iPad.</p><p>Affinity uses a one-time purchase pricing model that has earned it a loyal fanbase among creatives who are sick of paying for recurring subscriptions. <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/affinity-pricing/">Prices start at $69.99</a> for Affinity’s individual desktop apps or $164.99 for the entire suite, with a separate deal currently offering customers 50 percent off all perpetual licenses. </p><p>This discount, alongside the six-month free trial, is potentially geared at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/27/24113423/affinity-canva-acquisition-pledge-license-price-subscription">soothing concerns</a> that Affinity would change its pricing model after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/26/24112277/canva-affinity-acquisition-design-software-suite-adobe-rival">being acquired by Canva earlier this year</a>. “We’re saying ‘try everything and pay nothing’ because we understand making a change can be a big step, particularly for busy professionals,” said Affinity CEO Ashley Hewson. “Anyone who takes the trial is under absolutely no obligation to buy.”</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24191080/canva-ceo-melanie-perkins-design-ai-adobe-competition-decoder-podcast-interview"><em>Decoder </em>interview published today, Canva CEO Melanie Perkins</a> declined to describe its offering as a full alternative to Adobe’s Creative Cloud. However, she said the design market “has been a little bit of a one-horse race, and I don’t think that works out well for anyone...I think that being able to have another alternative in the market for professional designers benefits everyone.”</p></div></div></div>
