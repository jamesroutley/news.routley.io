    <h1>RTEMS Real Time Operating System</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>The Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems or RTEMS is an open source Real Time Operating System (RTOS) that supports open standard application programming interfaces (API) such as POSIX.  It is used in space flight, medical, networking and many more embedded devices. RTEMS currently supports 18 processor architectures and approximately 200 BSPs. These include ARM, PowerPC, Intel, SPARC, RISC-V, MIPS, and more. RTEMS includes multiple file systems, symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), embedded shell, and dynamic loading as well as a high-performance, full-featured IPV4/IPV6 TCP/IP stack from FreeBSD which also provides RTEMS with USB.</p>
<p>Major decisions about RTEMS are made by the core developers in concert with the user community, guided by the <a href="https://docs.rtems.org/branches/master/eng/mission.html">Mission Statement</a>.  We provide access to our development sources via a <a href="http://git.rtems.org">Git Repository</a> (see these  <a href="http://devel.rtems.org/wiki/Developer/Git">Instructions</a> for details).  We strive to provide regular, high-quality <a href="http://devel.rtems.org/wiki/TBR/Website/RTEMSReleases">releases</a>, which we want to work well on a wide range of embedded targets using cross development from a variety of hosts including GNU/Linux distributions, MS Windows, BSDs, Solaris, and Mac OS. We encourage everyone to <a href="http://devel.rtems.org/wiki/TBR/Website/WhyContribute">contribute changes</a> and feedback to RTEMS. </p>
<p>Commercial support is available from US and European companies, and free support comes via the active global community.</p>
