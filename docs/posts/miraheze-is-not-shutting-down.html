    <h1>Miraheze is not shutting down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
					        

					    <p>From Miraheze Meta, Miraheze&#39;s central coordination wiki</p>
					</div><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div><p>Hi all.
</p><p>Let me start with the important news: <b>Miraheze will not be shutting down.</b>  The community has pulled together in our time of crisis, and come up with a rescue plan, which I will explain in more detail later on.  But you need to know that there is no immediate risk of service shutdown, and no cause to leave immediately.
</p><p>I know that this has been an exhausting time for all of you, especially those of you who run wikis.  I know this because I felt it myself this week, as I grew increasingly worried about the survival of wiki communities that I and my friends rely on Miraheze to host.  I depend on Miraheze, and I know you do too, and we let you down.
</p><p>I was a major volunteer for Miraheze in the past. While I only recently renewed my involvement, I have been greatly impressed by the growth of the many communities served during the past three years under Miraheze Limited.  So when things started to fall apart, and the board announced their intention to dissolve Miraheze, I knew that we had to take a chance to save the farm.  For my own wikis, and for all of yours as well.
</p><p>We are in the process of starting up a new non-profit corporation to assume the assets of Miraheze Limited, and to continue providing the service that you expect (hopefully with some improvements).  We have put together a team of Miraheze veterans who will continue to run the site, and we&#39;re reaching out to the core volunteers who have left in recent weeks, because we&#39;re at our best when everyone is working together.  
</p><p>There will be plenty of time to look at where things went wrong before. Running a wiki farm with 6,774 wikis entirely off volunteer tech contributions is extremely challenging, and we lost focus on <b>our primary reason for existing: building a platform for everyone to make ad-free, free of cost, community-controlled, highly extensible wikis.</b> It’s a combination so important yet so hard to find elsewhere.  And to keep moving forward, we need to find ways to reduce the stress on the volunteers that keep the site running, and we need to do a better job communicating with all of you who visit and run wikis on Miraheze.
</p><p>The outgoing board has committed to keeping the site running while our new organization takes over.  We already have enough volunteers and money to keep things running.  So you should feel confident that your wiki on Miraheze will remain online for the foreseeable future.
</p><p>We can save it. We will save it. There is a lot of work ahead of us, but I believe it is all achievable, and I believe it is important.  So I hope you will join me here on Miraheze, and I hope your own wikis grow and prosper.

<p><span>@<a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Labster" title="User:Labster">Labster</a>:</span> This is indeed welcome news for a lot of people who run their wikis on Miraheze. Your energy and keenness to drive things forward in a new direction is altruistic, and what everyone wants to see right now: an active presence that focusses on the future and not the abandonment of something that has the potential be turned around. It&#39;s going to be a lot of work so I salute your efforts. I am also impressed by those answering the call for help to keep everything running. Hopefully, with a broad range of skillsets from those that will take on their new responsibilities, Miraheze will be on its first step to becoming a better service, and improving on its previous failings, which it MUST do to thrive. There are people out there in the community, myself included, that have been with Miraheze for a long time and wish they could help out but don&#39;t have the necessary tech-related skills. This is one of the reasons why I am not very active on Meta. But my absence there does not mean I don&#39;t have a passion for Miraheze. After all, this has been the home of my largest wiki for seven years, and I would like it to remain so for as long as possible. Thanks to everyone in this endeavour. <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Borderman" title="User:Borderman"><span>Borderman</span></a> <small><sup><a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User_talk:Borderman" title="User talk:Borderman"><span><b>(Talk)</b></span></a></sup></small> 10:44, 18 June 2023 (UTC)

<ul><li>Do we have any specific ideas/plans as to who will take over as SRE/steward? Is the Board/incorporation still going to be dissolved, or will we be appointing/nominating new members? Is <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Trust_and_Safety" title="Trust and Safety">Trust and Safety</a> going to remain a separate division, or will that be disbanded (it&#39;s effectively obsolete right now with no team members). – <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Amanda_Catherine" title="User:Amanda Catherine"><span><b>AmandaCath</b></span></a> <small>(<a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User_talk:Amanda_Catherine" title="User talk:Amanda Catherine"><span><b>talk</b></span></a>)</small> 14:54, 18 June 2023 (UTC)
<ul><li>You&#39;re asking for answers far too early in the process. As yet, Labster has not yet formally accepted my offer to become a volunteer, let alone started giving jobs to anyone. As for Trust and Safety, the work still needs to be done whether it is done by a separate group or a part of another group. --<a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Robkelk" title="User:Robkelk">Robkelk</a> (<a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User_talk:Robkelk" title="User talk:Robkelk">talk</a>) 15:20, 18 June 2023 (UTC)
<ul><li><s> <span>@<a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Robkelk" title="User:Robkelk">Robkelk</a>:</span> can you clarify what you were trying to say, I can’t quite understand what you are attempting to say. </s> Zppix (<a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Zppix" title="User:Zppix">Meta</a> | <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User_talk:Zppix" title="User talk:Zppix">talk to me</a>) 15:46, 18 June 2023 (UTC) Disregard: See my reply below.
<ul><li>I believe it&#39;s quite clear what <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Robkelk" title="User:Robkelk">Robkelk</a> is saying, and it&#39;s very similar to what <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:RhinosF1" title="User:RhinosF1">RhinosF1</a> says below, which is that we don&#39;t yet know what the U.S. corporate structure will look like, a corporation has yet to be established, and an agreement on the transfer of assets yet to be realized, so it&#39;s far too early to both (a) determining what the organizational structure will look like in terms of potential volunteer opportunities let alone (b) start reviewing and accepting applications for said structures. <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Dmehus" title="User:Dmehus">Dmehus</a> (<a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User_talk:Dmehus" title="User talk:Dmehus">talk</a>) 15:54, 18 June 2023 (UTC)
<ul><li>I just read it again, it makes sense, I was reading it wrong.

<li>In order, the exact internal structure and roles is yet to be defined. A lot of feedback has been taken in to see what might be best. Miraheze as a UK Limited company will cease. We still need a T&amp;S function but what that looks like is going to depend on the internal structure.  ~ <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:RhinosF1" title="User:RhinosF1">RhinosF1</a> - <sub><a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User_talk:RhinosF1" title="User talk:RhinosF1">(chat)</a></sub><sup><a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Special:CentralAuth/RhinosF1" title="Special:CentralAuth/RhinosF1">· acc</a><a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RhinosF1" title="Special:Contributions/RhinosF1">· c</a> </sup> - (<i>on</i>) 15:42, 18 June 2023 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>This is extremely relieving to hear. I haven&#39;t talked much within Miraheze circles about this situation (nor am I very active in Miraheze circles anyway) but this clears a huge amount of anxiety I have been feeling in the past few months for Miraheze&#39;s continued existence. I will admit that I have some reservations on how the new team and organization will operate, but as <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Borderman" title="User:Borderman">Borderman</a> mentioned, the energy is much more assuring than my own doubts. Wishing both you <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/User:Labster" title="User:Labster">Labster</a> and everyone who joins the new team success with this! This is a monumental task and I have hope that it will all end up well. -- <a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=User:Startacker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Startacker (page does not exist)">Startacker!</a> (<a href="https://meta.miraheze.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Startacker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Startacker (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 22:37, 18 June 2023 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Yes. The fine details around this is still ongoing, at this time the current incorporation will remain until a transfer is ready to be done at an undecided point in the future.
