No serious injuries were reported on the flight, according to federal safety officials. The flight returned to Portland, Oregon, shortly after takeoff on Friday after a pressurization issue was reported.</p><p>Images and video of Alaska&#39;s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BA/">Boeing</a> 737 Max 9 shared on social media showed a gaping hole on the side of the plane and passengers using oxygen masks before it returned to Portland.</p><p>&#34;Safety will continue to drive our decision-making as we assist the NTSB&#39;s investigation into Alaska Airlines Flight 1282,&#34; FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement.</p><p>The incident was described as &#34;an explosive decompression at the window exit,&#34; said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, the labor union that represents Alaska&#39;s cabin crew and flight attendants at United, <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-5"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SAVE/">Spirit</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> and other carriers.</p><p>Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aerospace safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, said such an incident is extremely rare.</p><p>&#34;Rapid decompression is a serious matter,&#34; he said. &#34;To see a gaping hole in an aircraft is not something we typically see. In aviation safety, we would call this a structural failure.&#34;</p><p>Alaska Airlines overnight said it would ground its fleet of Boeing 737 Max 9 planes. Alaska said on Saturday morning, local time, that it had completed inspections on more than a quarter of its 737 Max 9 fleet &#34;with no concerning findings.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Aircraft will return to service as their inspections are completed with our full confidence,&#34; the Seattle-based airline said.</p><p>More than 100 flights, about 14% of Alaska&#39;s schedule, were canceled on Saturday, according to FlightAware.</p></div><h2><a id="headline0"></a>Investigation begins</h2><div><p>The National Transportation Safety Board sent a team to Portland on Saturday to investigate the incident.</p><p><span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-6"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UAL/">United Airlines</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>, the largest operator of the planes in the U.S., was preparing to ground dozens of its <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-7"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BA/">Boeing</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span> 737 Max 9 aircraft for inspections, CNBC reported earlier Saturday.</p><p>United has 79 Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft in its fleet but just over 30 of them have already &#34;received the necessary inspection that is required by the FAA,&#34; the airline said. The inspections were expected to cause about 60 flight cancellations on Saturday, United said.</p><p>United has close to 80 of the planes in its fleet, though some of the jets have recently undergone in-depth, routine inspections.</p><p>The FAA said the inspections will take between four and eight hours per plane, the agency said.</p><p>The Boeing 737 Max 9 is a larger version of Boeing&#39;s best-selling jetliner, the 737 Max 8. Max planes were grounded worldwide in 2019 after <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/17/two-boeing-737-fatal-plane-crashes-the-world-turns-on-the-faa.html">two fatal crashes</a> within about five months of one another. The U.S. lifted its flight ban of the jets in late 2020 after software and training updates.</p><p>Large-scale groundings of aircraft by the FAA or other aviation authorities are rare.</p><p>The Boeing 737 Max 9 has an emergency exit door cut behind the wings for use in dense seating cabin configurations, like those used by budget airlines, according to Flightradar24.</p><p>&#34;The doors are not activated on Alaska Airlines aircraft and are permanently &#39;plugged,&#39;&#34; Flightradar24 said.</p><p>Boeing didn&#39;t to comment beyond its statement when asked about the sealed emergency exit door. <span data-test="QuoteInBody" id="RegularArticle-QuoteInBody-9"><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SPR/">Spirit AeroSystems</a><span><span id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"></span></span></span>, which makes the fuselages for the planes, referred CNBC to Boeing when asked about the incident.</p><p>&#34;Safety is our top priority and we deeply regret the impact this event has had on our customers and their passengers,&#34; Boeing said in a statement on Saturday. &#34;We agree with and fully support the FAA&#39;s decision to require immediate inspections of 737-9 airplanes with the same configuration as the affected airplane.&#34;</p><p>The company said it is supporting the NTSB&#39;s investigation.</p><p>There are 215 Boeing 737 Max 9 planes in service worldwide, according to aviation-data firm Cirium.
