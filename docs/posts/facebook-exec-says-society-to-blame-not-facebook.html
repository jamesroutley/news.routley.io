    <h1>Facebook Exec Says Society to Blame, Not Facebook</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Longtime Facebook veteran Andrew Bosworth insists that political and COVID-19 misinformation are societal problems rather than issues that have been magnified by social networks.</p><p><strong>Why it matters</strong>: Critics say Facebook and other social networks have played a significant role in vaccine hesitancy and the spread of political misinformation.</p><ul><li>&#34;Individual humans are the ones who choose to believe or not believe a thing. They are the ones who choose to share or not share a thing,&#34; Bosworth said in an interview with &#34;Axios on HBO.&#34; </li><li>&#34;I don&#39;t feel comfortable at all saying they don&#39;t have a voice because I don&#39;t like what they said.&#34;</li></ul><p>Bosworth has been <a data-vars-link-text="leading Facebook&#39;s hardware efforts" data-vars-click-url="https://www.axios.com/facebook-virtual-reality-sales-5993e65c-674d-454d-a8ea-f2e7e9cd106b.html" data-vars-event-category="story" data-vars-sub-category="story" data-vars-item="in_content_link" href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-virtual-reality-sales-5993e65c-674d-454d-a8ea-f2e7e9cd106b.html" target="_self">leading Facebook&#39;s hardware efforts</a>, including those in virtual and augmented reality. Next year he will become CTO for Meta, Facebook&#39;s parent company.</p><p><strong>Between the lines</strong>: Asked whether vaccine hesitancy would be the same with or without social media, Bosworth defended Facebook&#39;s role in combatting COVID, noting that the company ran one of the largest information campaigns in the world to spread authoritative information. </p><ul><li>He said that individuals make the choice whether to listen to that information or to rely on less reputable information spread by friends and family.</li><li>&#34;That&#39;s their choice. They are allowed to do that. You have an issue with those people. You don&#39;t have an issue with Facebook. You can&#39;t put that on me.&#34;</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture</strong>: Pressed on whether Facebook and others are amplifying those views, Bosworth characterized it as a demand problem rather than one caused by the amount of misinformation on social media.</p><ul><li>&#34;People want that information,&#34; Bosworth said. &#34;I don&#39;t believe that the answer is &#39;I will deny these people the information they seek and I will enforce my will upon them.&#39; &#34;</li><li>&#34;At some point the onus is, and should be in any meaningful democracy, on the individual.&#34;</li></ul></div></div>
