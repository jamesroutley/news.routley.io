    <h1>Two hackers one keyboard two ways</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>There’s an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl6rsi7BEtk">amazing and famous scene of two hackers sharing a keyboard</a> on NCIS, but it gets a lot of derision on the internet. What people don’t realize is that their mockery only reveals their own lack of skill. As everyone knows, a true hacker has mastered the art of dual wielding, and a keyboard that can be dual wielded by one might also be used by two hackers in tandem.</p><p>Presented here are two programs which would be of use to two operators in repelling a network intrusion, or which might be used solo by a highly skilled operator, a true hacker. Take your larping beyond just playing dress up.<br/></p><h3>duelmon</h3><p><a href="https://humungus.tedunangst.com/r/fungo/v/tip/f/duelmon/main.go"><b>duelmon</b></a> is a split screen dual process and network monitor custom made for high intensity network intrusions. Can’t decide between running <i>ps</i> or <i>netstat</i> to catch the baddies? Run both!</p><p>Along the left is a process tree which can be navigated with WASD. On the right are network connections, navigable with HJKL. One can quickly scan both lists moving back and forth with minimal distractions. Or work with a friend. “Lots of movement on port 80! ... I see it, I see it; apache is pre-forking!”</p><p>And of course, problematic entries can be marked for the watchlist using X or M. And then cancelled or nuked using C or N. It’s all there, at the tips of your fingers on both hands.</p><pre><code>/sbin/init                             conns

True hackers only.</p><p>The keyboard is split approximately down the middle, between YGB and UHN. Keystrokes from the left are sent to one window; keystrokes from the right are sent to a second window. Now you’re free to run commands in two terminals at once, without wasting time refocusing input. They’re <i>both</i> focused, subject to your mental limits.</p><p>To type letters on the other side of the keyboard, the win and menu keys are used as input modifiers. The keyboard is mirrored around the center line, using caps lock as enter on the left. (setxkbmap -option caps:none helps a lot.)</p><p>The left operator can run <i>ls</i> by typing win-S, s, capslock. The right operator can run <i>ls</i> by typing l, menu-L, enter.<br/></p><h3>quad mastery</h3><p>Legend foretells the coming of a hacker who can use both mirrorkeys and duelmon at once. Trick <i>and</i> treat.
