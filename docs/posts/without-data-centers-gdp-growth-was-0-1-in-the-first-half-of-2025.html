    <h1>Without data centers, GDP growth was 0.1% in the first half of 2025</h1>

<p>Furman’s findings, shared online and echoed by financial analysts including Robert Armstrong of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/603be7d5-13ac-4047-9854-24db5f0f0802" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.ft.com/content/603be7d5-13ac-4047-9854-24db5f0f0802"><em>Financial Times</em>‘ Unhedged</a> (the same writer who coined the term “TACO trade’), echo <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/06/data-center-artificial-intelligence-bubble-consumer-spending-economy/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/08/06/data-center-artificial-intelligence-bubble-consumer-spending-economy/">several months of observations</a> on the remarkable surge in data-center infrastructure. In August, Renaissance Macro Research estimated, to date in 2025, the dollar value contributed to GDP growth by AI data-center buildout had surpassed U.S. consumer spending for the first time ever. That’s remarkable considering <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11657" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11657">consumer spending is two-thirds of GDP</a>.<a href="https://x.com/AllVentured/status/1951770496711934459" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/AllVentured/status/1951770496711934459"></a></p><p>Tech giants such as <a href="https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/">Google</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/facebook/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/facebook/">Meta</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/">Nvidia</a> have poured tens of billions of dollars into building and upgrading data centers, responding to explosive demand for artificial intelligence and large language models that require massive computing resources. 



</p><p>Lisa Shallet, chief investment officer for <a href="https://fortune.com/company/morgan-stanley/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/morgan-stanley/">Morgan Stanley</a> Wealth Management, flagged on Sept. 29 that spending was truly massive among the so-called “hyperscalers” who are striving for huge computing, storage and networking capacity. 



</p><p>“In recent years, hyperscaler capex on data center and related items has risen fourfold and is nearing $400 billion annually,” she wrote. “The speed of growth and size of the investment are skewing its aggregate economic impact, with the top 10 spenders accounting for nearly a third of all spending … For perspective, it’s estimated that data center-linked spending is adding roughly 100 basis points to U.S. real GDP growth.”</p><p><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="764" height="426" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 60vw, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 33vw" srcset="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=128&amp;q=85 128w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=256&amp;q=85 256w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=320&amp;q=85 320w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=384&amp;q=85 384w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=480&amp;q=85 480w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=576&amp;q=85 576w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=768&amp;q=85 768w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=1024&amp;q=85 1024w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=1280&amp;q=85 1280w, https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=1440&amp;q=85 1440w" src="https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/lisa-shalett.png?w=1440&amp;q=85"/></p>



<h2>The ‘mystery’ of the economy</h2>



<p>This surge in technology-led growth comes against a backdrop of wider economic sluggishness and paradoxically strong GDP growth. Job creation has slowed, raising concerns that, absent technology investment, the U.S. economy could have slipped into recession. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-data-centers-massive-150110727.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Go to https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spending-ai-data-centers-massive-150110727.html"></a>Other sectors—from manufacturing and real estate to retail and services—contributed little or even detracted from overall output in the first half of 2025. 



</p><p>And yet, as <a href="https://fortune.com/company/apollo-global-management/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/apollo-global-management/">Apollo Global Management</a> Chief Economist Torsten Sløk has noted, the <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/10/01/us-economy-getting-stronger-not-weaker-apollo-torsten-slok-growth-gdp-spending-jobs/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/10/01/us-economy-getting-stronger-not-weaker-apollo-torsten-slok-growth-gdp-spending-jobs/">GDP figures speak of a (statistically) strong economy</a>. 



</p><p>“The consensus has been wrong since January,” Sløk said in a note circulated to clients in early October, adding the average of economists’ forecasts has said the U.S. economy would slow down for nine months consecutively. “But the reality is that it has simply not happened … We in the economics profession need to look ourselves in the mirror.”



</p><p>Furman’s analysis adds to the snarky and accurate observation by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/style/today-in-tabs-rusty-foster-media-gossip-maine.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/17/style/today-in-tabs-rusty-foster-media-gossip-maine.html">Rusty Foster</a> of <em><a href="https://www.todayintabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.todayintabs.com/">Today in Tabs</a></em> who quipped: “Our economy might just be three AI data centers in a trench coat”—an allusion to the data-center buildout boom and to the cartoon trope/sight gag of <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-origin-of-the-sight-gag-where-three-small-people-stack-up-in-a-trench-coat-and-pretend-to-be-one-ordinary-size-adult" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Go to https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-origin-of-the-sight-gag-where-three-small-people-stack-up-in-a-trench-coat-and-pretend-to-be-one-ordinary-size-adult">several young boys</a> teaming up to disguise themselves as an adult.</p><p>Morgan Stanley Chief Economist Michael Gapen ventured a guess on Oct. 6 about “the mystery” of the 2025 economy, “between solid spending data and weak hiring.” He argued that it “can be explained by a corporate sector that absorbed the initial cost of tariffs and reduced unit labor costs and profitability rather than raising prices.” 



</p><p>In other words, something that has nothing to do with the data-center buildout that is widely fueling bubble fears, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/10/04/jeff-bezos-amazon-openai-sam-altman-ai-bubble-tech-stocks-investing/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2025/10/04/jeff-bezos-amazon-openai-sam-altman-ai-bubble-tech-stocks-investing/">even among Amazon founder Jeff Bezos himself</a>, who insists these data centers are an “industrial bubble” rather than a financial one, and we will all be glad someday to have such incredible computing power at our fingertips with so many hundreds of billions spent. The question of sustainable GDP growth is a separate one.<br/></p></div><p><strong>Fortune Global Forum</strong> returns Oct. 26–27, 2025 in Riyadh.
