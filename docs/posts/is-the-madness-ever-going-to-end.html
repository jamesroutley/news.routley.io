<p><span id="description">There is something seriously wrong with the IT industry. It&#39;s so bad that I haven&#39;t managed to find a single industry with the same massive amount of stupidity, with the exception of perhaps the fashion industry. It&#39;s like the IT industry has been paralyzed in some strange kind of mass hypnosis.</span></p>

<p>No, I will not be polite and call it something else because it is truly sheer stupidity.</p>

<p>In the past IT people, whether we&#39;re talking about programmers or something else, where very clever people. People with a high level of intelligence that took serious pride in doing things in a meaningful and pragmatic way.</p>

<p>In the so-called modern day it&#39;s like everyone - except a few - has dropped their brain on the floor. They keep inventing &#34;revolutionary new ways&#34; of doing the exact same thing that could be done in a dozen ways already. And they do that by coating more and more and more unnecessary complexity on top of existing technology stacks.</p>

<p>Electron and React Native Desktop are supposed to be a revolutionary new way of making desktop applications. Except they are not and they eat up all the memory you have and still ask for more. They constantly crash and has no value over a native desktop application what so ever - well, perhaps with the only exception that now a 2 year old baby can make something shiny that you can click on with your mouse.</p>

<p><i>But, noooo, you&#39;re a dinosaur, you don&#39;t understand anything, it&#39;s the future, it&#39;s the modern way of doing things. Native desktop apps are dead!</i></p>

<p>PHP is a programming language mainly for web development. It is made in C, a pure procedural language, originally as a templating language, and it still is a templating language at the very core, yet it is apparently not good enough. We have to put a completely different template system on top of PHP, also written in PHP, which now makes the application load four times as slow.</p>

<p><i>But, noooo, you&#39;re a dinosaur, you don&#39;t understand anything, it&#39;s the future, it&#39;s the modern way of doing things. We don&#39;t do that in modern web development any more!</i></p>

<p>All web servers has a build in router. Whether it&#39;s NGINX, Apache, lighttpd, Caddy or something else. But no. Let&#39;s not use that, let&#39;s add yet another router on top of that with a single entry point and then basically re-write every single request before it gets served.</p>

<p><i>But, noooo, you&#39;re a dinosaur, you don&#39;t understand anything, it&#39;s the future, it&#39;s the modern way of doing things. We don&#39;t do that in modern web development any more!</i></p>

<p>The browsers native language is HTML. HTML is a markup language and if you feed HTML to the browser it will very quickly render the page with what you give it. But no. Let&#39;s not do that. Let&#39;s instead feed the browser with JSON and then have the build in JavaScript engine translate that into a pre-formatted output which then gets translated into HTML before it&#39;s served to the user. Oh, and while we&#39;re add it, let&#39;s do the exact same thing with CSS. So, now your simple news article or blog post takes ages to load on a 1 gigabit connection and requires about 3 times as much electrical power even though you&#39;re only serving text and perhaps a few images - just because someone though it was a really good idea to make a React app instead of a simple HTML page rendered by the server.</p>

<p>Why in the world has this idiotic trend of abstracting everything away by layers upon layers of complexity gained such a strong foothold in the industry? Has everyone except the &#34;unix greybeards&#34; gone mad!?</p>

<p>The situation is really bad for the industry. And it is a real shame that the younger generations who grow up not knowing anything else, thinking that these so-called &#34;modern way of doing things&#34; are the correct and best ways, will have to suffer when everything starts to crumble.</p>

<p>The entry barrier to programming needs to high! Programming is engineering, it&#39;s not something where you throw stuff at the wall and see what sticks and just assume that programming languages, browsers and operating systems are made of magical dust.</p>
