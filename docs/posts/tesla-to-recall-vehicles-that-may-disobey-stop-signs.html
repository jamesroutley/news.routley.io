NHTSA said the feature also known as FSD Beta may allow vehicles to travel through an all-way stop intersection without first coming to a stop.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Tesla will perform an over-the-air software update that disables the &#34;rolling stop&#34; functionality, NHTSA said. The agency added it &#34;maintains regular discussions with all manufacturers to discuss potential safety concerns of these types of systems.&#34;</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said on Twitter &#34;there were no safety issues&#34; with the function. &#34;The car simply slowed to ~2 mph &amp; continued forward if clear view with no cars or pedestrians,&#34; Musk wrote.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">NHTSA noted federal law &#34;prohibits manufacturers from selling vehicles with defects posing unreasonable risks to safety, including intentional design choices that are unsafe.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">Last week, Tesla said the number of FSD beta vehicles in the United States increased to nearly 60,000 from a few thousand at the end of September. Tesla has been testing the improved version of its automated driving software on public roads, but the carmaker and the regulator have said the features do not make the cars autonomous.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Tesla said as of Jan. 27 it was not aware of any warranty claims, crashes, injuries or fatalities related to the recall.</p><div data-testid="gallery-0" domain="https://www.reuters.com" article_url="/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recalls-nearly-54000-us-vehicles-rolling-stop-software-feature-2022-02-01/"><div><div><p>The TESLA logo is seen outside a dealership in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, U.S., April 26, 2021.

The automaker said to use the feature vehicles must be traveling below 5.6 miles (9 km) per hour and no relevant moving cars, pedestrians or bicyclists are detected near the intersection.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">The feature, which appeared to violate state laws that require vehicles to come to a complete stop and required drivers to opt-in for what it dubbed &#34;Assertive&#34; mode, drew attention on social media and prompted NHTSA to raise questions with Tesla.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">According to a <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2022/RCLRPT-22V037-4462.PDF" target="_blank">defect report</a> filed with the auto safety agency, Tesla said it met with NHTSA staff on Jan. 10 and Jan. 19 &#34;to discuss the functionality, including operating parameters&#34; and the automaker on Jan. 20 agreed to the recall.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">In November, Tesla recalled nearly 12,000 U.S. vehicles sold since 2017 for another software update because a communication error could cause a false forward-collision warning or unexpected activation of the emergency brakes.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">NHTSA said last week it had sought additional information from Tesla in its probe into 580,000 vehicles over the automaker&#39;s decision to allow games to be played by passengers on the front center touchscreen.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">In December, NHTSA opened a preliminary evaluation into 2017-2022 Tesla Model 3, S, X, and Y vehicles over the vehicle&#39;s &#34;Passenger Play&#34; feature the agency said &#34;may distract the driver and increase the risk of a crash.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-14">In August, NHTSA opened a formal safety probe into Tesla&#39;s Autopilot driver assistance system in 765,000 U.S. vehicles after about a dozen crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles. That investigation also remains open.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by David Shepardson, Editing by Louise Heavens, Tomasz Janowski and Bernard Orr</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
