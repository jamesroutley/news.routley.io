    <h1>The risk of RISC-V: What&#39;s going on at SiFive?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p>A quick one for you. I have received reports, now from multiple sources, that the major torch bearer of the RISC-V platform, a company known as SiFive and formed from the original architects of the RISC-V instruction set, has gone through some major changes.</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://morethanmoore.substack.com/p/the-risk-of-risc-v-whats-going-on?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://morethanmoore.substack.com/p/the-risk-of-risc-v-whats-going-on?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>RISC-V is well known as the royalty free alternative to other core architectures on the market. The idea is that anyone can pick up the architecture, build their own core out of it, add their own custom features to it, then build it without any royalty payments. The problem is that building a core, or building an SoC, isn&#39;t that simple. Lots of techniques go into designing a core, and simply having an architecture isn&#39;t the end-point, it&#39;s merely the start. That&#39;s why RISC-V has seen a lot of adoption for people who want to design cores on paper, but then it has taken time to come into silicon. Even beyond that, if you want a chip that is either high performance, or high efficiency, or both, then you still need a team of dedicated core and SoC designers to go make that happen.</p><p><span>RISC-V has seen major pickup in the low-end core space, particularly replacing microcontrollers. Companies like Western Digital have been very public about their RISC-V cores replacing microcontrollers and other functions in their storage devices. Other companies like NVIDIA, Google, and recently Qualcomm, have staked their RISC-V intentions, and since the bust-up between Arm and China, RISC-V is taking a footing over there as well. Some companies are looking at high performance RISC-V cores, such as Tenstorrent (you can watch my video of their 128-core chiplet </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spipSjgKXu0" rel="">here</a><span>) and Ventana Micro. A lot of the companies involved in RISC-V are part of the RISC-V International consortium which essentially manages the ecosystem, with a lot of companies upstreaming key parts of the architecture and microarchitecture for performance, security, and other aspects. A level playing field for foundational support, such as an equivalent to ARM&#39;s SBSA L3 that ensures all servers meet specific minimum requirements, is also the target of RISC-V International.</span></p><p>There are also a number of companies in the Core IP business for RISC-V cores. SiFive has been the biggest for a while - it has achieved $365m in venture capital to date up to Series F, as well as sold off part of its assets for $220m in the last 12 months or so. Things have been riding high - it has a portfolio of cores that companies can license for their RISC-V designs, from microcontrollers to scalar cores to vector cores. It still follows the Arm model of licensing a core, but maintains the open-ness and customization that RISC-V offers.</p><p>So what is this news today? Through multiple sources, SiFive has instigated a large number of layoffs. Numbers vary, from 100 to 300+, but multiple sources confirm that most of the engineering team, especially the physical design engineers, sales, and product team. The management team have also been fired from what I&#39;ve been told, leaving the founders and CEO Patrick Little at the helm. That&#39;s a heck of a shake up.</p><p>But that&#39;s not all. The product portfolio is also being gutted. SiFive&#39;s business always had two elements - predesigned cores you can pick up, most of which have already been silicon proved, and SiFive even announced two new cores literally only a week ago. The other half of the business is custom cores - where clients would approach the team with specific requirements and then SiFive would actually go and design it, to be installed into a full SoC. My contacts are telling me (although not to the same level of certainty as the layoffs) that the pre-designed core portfolio is no more. SiFive from now on it seems will only be working on custom cores.</p><p>I approached SiFive&#39;s PR agency to get details. They provided me with an official statement:</p><blockquote><p>“As we adjust to the rapidly changing semiconductor end markets, SiFive is realigning across all of our teams and geographies to better take advantage of the opportunities ahead, reduce operational complexities and increase our ability to respond quickly to customer product requirements. Unfortunately, as a result some positions were eliminated last week. The employees are being offered severance and outplacement assistance. SiFive continues to be excited about the momentum and long-term outlook for our business and RISC-V.”</p></blockquote><p>That statement confirms stuff is going on, but also doesn&#39;t say much. It confirms there are layoffs for sure, but then also says &#39;reduce operational complexity&#39;, which often means cutting the product portfolio. &#39;Responding quickly&#39; means smaller teams more often than not, and &#39;realigning across geographies&#39; may suggest pulling out of certain markets (i.e., sales). Perhaps a formal announcement will be made in due course.</p><p>This is a bit of a stab into the belly of RISC-V, given the prominence with which SiFive has taken to the industry in promoting RISC-V technology. It sounds like SiFive will stick around, however I wonder how long the founders will stay there if the only business being done is custom cores. Perhaps SiFive&#39;s big business was custom cores, and this is not much of a change, but given the numbers for layoffs I&#39;m hearing, it sounds like there will be fewer contributions to the RISC-V standards from SiFive from now on. There&#39;s also the question of what this means for investors, what questions they&#39;ll be asking, and what answers they&#39;ll be getting.</p><p>More on this story as it develops.
