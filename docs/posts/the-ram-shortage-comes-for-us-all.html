    <h1>The RAM shortage comes for us all</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Memory price inflation comes for us all, and if you&#39;re not affected yet, just wait.</p>

<p>I was building a new PC last month using some parts I had bought earlier this year. The 64 Gigabyte T-Create DDR5 memory kit I used cost $209 then. Today? The <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/680461/teamgroup-t-create-expert-64gb-(2-x-32gb)-ddr5-6400-pc5-51200-cl34-dual-channel-desktop-memory-kit-ctced564g6400hc34bdc01-black">same kit costs $650</a>!</p>

<p>Just in the past week, we found out <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/1gb-raspberry-pi-5-now-available-at-45-and-memory-driven-price-rises/">Raspberry Pi&#39;s increasing their single board computer prices</a>. Micron&#39;s <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">killing the Crucial brand of RAM and storage devices <em>completely</em></a>, meaning there&#39;s gonna be one fewer consumer memory manufacturer. <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2998935/ram-is-so-expensive-samsung-wont-even-sell-it-to-samsung.html"><em>Samsung</em> can&#39;t even buy RAM from themselves</a> to build their own Smartphones, and small vendors like <a href="https://x.com/librecomputer/status/1995592912063922578">Libre Computer</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyueVGLT7qI">Mono</a> are seeing RAM prices double, triple, or even <em>worse</em>, and they&#39;re not even buying the latest RAM tech!</p>

<p><img src="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/sites/default/files/images/2025.12.04.usd_.ram_.ddr5_.6000.2x16384.5cd324eb79715651e5c39693bcec4df7.png" width="700" height="288" data-insert-type="image" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="insert-image-f1375eba-a3ff-4067-88a1-3c82bde89efd" data-insert-attach="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;f1375eba-a3ff-4067-88a1-3c82bde89efd&#34;,&#34;attributes&#34;:{&#34;alt&#34;:[&#34;alt&#34;,&#34;description&#34;],&#34;title&#34;:[&#34;title&#34;]}}" alt="PC Parts Picker RAM Graph"/></p>

<p>I think PC builders might be the first crowd to get impacted across the board—just look at these <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/memory/">insane graphs from PC Parts Picker</a>, showing RAM prices going from like $30 to $120 for DDR4, or like $150 to <em>five hundred dollars</em> for 64 gigs of DDR5.</p>

<p>But the impacts are only just starting to hit other markets.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/librecomputer/status/1995592912063922578">Libre Computer mentioned on Twitter</a> a single 4 gigabyte module of LPDDR4 memory costs $35. That&#39;s more expensive than every other component on one of their single board computers <em>combined</em>! You can&#39;t survive selling products at a loss, so once the current production batches are sold through, either prices will be increased, or certain product lines will go out of stock.</p>

<p>The smaller the company, the worse the price hit will be. Even Raspberry Pi, who I&#39;m sure has a little more margin built in, already raised SBC prices (and introduced a 1 GB Pi 5—maybe a good excuse for developers to drop Javascript frameworks and program for lower memory requirements again?).</p>

<p>Cameras, gaming consoles, tablets, almost anything that has memory will get hit sooner or later.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this, but compared to the <em>current</em> market, Apple&#39;s insane memory upgrade pricing is... actually in line with the rest of the industry.</p>

<div>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9rbz0akyLyQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div>

<p>The reason for all this, of course, is AI datacenter buildouts. I have no clue if there&#39;s any price fixing going on like there was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRAM_price_fixing_scandal">a few decades ago</a>—that&#39;s something conspiracy theorists can debate—but the problem is there&#39;s only a few companies producing all the world&#39;s memory supplies.</p>

<p>And those companies all realized they can make <em>billions</em> more dollars making RAM just for AI datacenter products, and neglect the rest of the market.</p>

<p>So they&#39;re shutting down their consumer memory lines, and devoting all production to AI.</p>

<p>Even companies like GPU board manufacturers are getting shafted; <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-reportedly-no-longer-supplying-vram-to-its-gpu-board-partners-in-response-to-memory-crunch-rumor-claims-vendors-will-only-get-the-die-forced-to-source-memory-on-their-own">Nvidia&#39;s not giving memory to them along with their chips like they used to</a>, basically telling them &#34;good luck, you&#39;re on your own for VRAM now!&#34;</p>

<p>Which is especially rich, because <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/11/19/nvidias-record-57b-revenue-and-upbeat-forecast-quiets-ai-bubble-talk/">Nvidia&#39;s profiting <em>obscenely</em> off of all this stuff</a>.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all bad enough, but some people see a silver lining. I&#39;ve seen some people say &#34;well, once the AI bubble bursts, at least we&#39;ll have a ton of cheap hardware flooding the market!&#34;</p>

<p>And yes, in past decades, that might be one outcome.</p>

<p>But the problem here is the RAM they&#39;re making, a ton of it is either integrated into specialized GPUs that won&#39;t run on normal computers, or being fitted into special types of memory modules that don&#39;t work on consumer PCs, either. (See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory">HBM</a>).</p>

<p>That, and the GPUs and servers being deployed now don&#39;t even run on normal power and cooling, they&#39;re part of <em>massive</em> systems that would take a ton of effort to get running in even the most well-equipped homelabs. It&#39;s not like the classic <a href="https://merox.dev/blog/dell-r720/">Dell R720</a> that just needs some air and a wall outlet to run.</p>

<p>That is to say, we might be hitting a weird era where the PC building hobby is gutted, SBCs get prohibitively expensive, and anyone who didn&#39;t stockpile parts earlier this year is, pretty much, in a lurch.</p>

<p>Even <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2986266/lenovo-stockpiles-ram-to-hopefully-keep-laptop-prices-down.html">Lenovo admits to stockpiling RAM</a>, making this like the toilet paper situation back in 2020, except for massive corporations. Not enough supply, so companies who <em>can</em> afford to get some will buy it all up, hoping to stave off the shortages that will probably last longer, partly <em>because</em> of that stockpiling.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s completely outlandish to think some companies will start <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WO-VvucMq4E">scavenging memory chips</a> (ala <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/dosdude1">dosdude1</a>) off other systems for stock, especially if RAM prices keep going up.</p>

<p>It&#39;s either that, or just stop making products. There are some echoes to the global chip shortages that hit in 2021-2022, and that really shook up the market for smaller companies.</p>

<p>I hate to see it happening again, but somehow, here we are a few years later, except this time, the AI bubble is to blame.</p>

<p>Sorry for not having a positive note to end this on, but I guess... maybe it&#39;s a good time to dig into that pile of old projects you never finished instead of buying something new this year.</p>

<p>How long will this last? That&#39;s anybody&#39;s guess. But I&#39;ve already put off some projects I was gonna do for 2026, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one.</p></div></div>
