    <h1>Philippines orders fraud probe after paying MacBook prices for Celeron laptops</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>When COVID-19 closed schools in The Philippines, the nation’s government acted to ensure its teachers had the kit they needed to keep working by allocating funds to acquire nearly 70,000 laptops.</p>
<p>The laptops have long since arrived but their purchase has now become a political scandal as it has emerged that the nation significantly overpaid for the kit it procured, and was able to acquire fewer machines as a result.</p>
<p>The problems with the program were detailed by the Philippines Commission of Audit, which <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coa.gov.ph/reports/annual-audit-reports/aar-ngs/#49-5270-department-of-education-1654481445">found</a> that the Department of Education allocated P35,046.50 ($627) to each laptop, but agreed to pay P58,300 ($1042) apiece despite one bidder offering a lower price of P43,000 ($770).</p>

    

<p>That price hike saw the planned purchase plunge from 68,500 laptops to 39,583 machines.</p>

        


        

<p>It gets worse: the auditor found that the laptops purchased under the program at $1042 apiece used Intel’s very, very, low-end Celeron processor, which is not very useful for many modern tasks and are these days most often found in budget machines or Chromebooks.</p>
<p>The auditor also noted that in 2020 the Department of Education paid $581 apiece for Dell machines running an 8th-gen Core i5. The audit office also did a little price comparison and found Dell currently offers a machine far better than the Celerons at less than half the price paid by the Department of Education.</p>

        

<p>As pointed out by Filipino investigative outlet <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rappler.com/nation/why-commission-audit-flagged-deped-billions-worth-outdated-laptops/"><i>Rappler</i></a>, the base model of Apple’s latest MacBook Air sells for $999 - $43 bucks less than the Philippines has shelled out for Celeron-powered machines.</p>

<p>Interest in just why so much was spent on such inferior machines has naturally been keen. So keen that yesterday, as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1181402">reported</a> by the Philippines national news agency, education minister and vice president Sara Duterte has ordered the Department of Education to request the Commission of Audit to conduct a fraud inquiry.</p>
<p>“While we are not yet declaring that there is a fraudulent transaction that happened at that time, we’re also not saying that there is none,” Duterte said.</p>
<p>Documents have already been summoned and despatched to the Commission of Audit.</p>
<p>No timeframe has been set for findings to be delivered but <i>The Register</i> will keep an eye on this one out of sheer curiosity to learn how it was possible to blow millions of dollars on Celerons. ®</p>
