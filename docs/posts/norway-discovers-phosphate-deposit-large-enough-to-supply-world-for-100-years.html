While it proved ineffective in turning ordinary metals into gold, it has become an essential component in lithium-iron phosphate batteries in <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/electric-cars">electric cars</a>, as well as for solar panels and computer chips.</p><p>Russia previously controlled the world’s largest ultra-pure phosphate rock deposits, with the European Union warning that these “critical raw materials” have a high supply risk.</p><p>The EU is currently almost entirely dependent on imports of phosphate rock from the rest of the world, according to a report from The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, with China, Iraq and Syria also home to large deposits.</p><p><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.phosphorusplatform.eu/images/download/HCSS_17_12_12_Phosphate.pdf">The report</a>, which was published before the discovery of the massive Norwegian deposit, warned that the EU should be “concerned about phosphate rock shortages”.</p><p>An <a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43246-022-00236-4&amp;sref=https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/battery-solar-panels-norway-phosphate-b2368444.html">article</a> in the scientific journal <em>Nature</em> last year warned of imminent supply disruptions of phosphorus, citing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent economic sanctions as a potential cause of market volatility.</p><p>The global economy consumes an estimated 50 million tonnes of phosphorus each year, with scientists warning earlier this year that the planet could face a “phosphogeddon” if supply trends continue.</p><p>“The buyers’ market is becoming increasingly crowded by limited trade – due to political instability in several source countries, as well as international sanctions imposed on others,” Norge Mining noted in a <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://norgemining.com/2023/06/21/phosphorus-a-victim-of-its-own-success/">June blog post</a>. “This is forcing importers to fear an impending crisis.”</p><figure><figcaption><p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced in Shanghai on 7 January, 2020, that Model 3 vehicles made in China would used lithium iron phosphate batteries</p><p> (Getty Images)</p></figcaption></figure><p>Norway’s minister of trade and industry, Jan Christian Vestre, said last month that the government was considering fast-tracking a giant mine in Helleland once analysis is completed on 47 miles of drill cores. If approval is given, the first major mine could begin operation by 2028.</p><p>The politician said Norway’s “obligation” was to develop “the world’s most sustainable mineral industry” following the discovery of the minerals.</p><p>The mining plans already have the support of the European Raw Materials Alliance, according to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.aftenbladet.no/direkte/i/oW1nAK/aftenbladets-oekonomistudio">local reports</a>, while local consultations continue. </p><p>A spokesperson for the European Commission described the discovery as “great news” for meeting the objectives of the Commission’s raw material objectives, with Norge Mining telling <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/great-news-eu-hails-discovery-of-massive-phosphate-rock-deposit-in-norway/">Euractiv</a> that the projected 4,500-metre-deep ore body would theoretically be capable of meeting global demand for the next century.</p></div></div>
