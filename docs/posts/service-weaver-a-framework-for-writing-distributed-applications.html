We are excited to introduce Service Weaver, <strong>an open source framework for building and deploying distributed applications</strong>. Service Weaver allows you to write your application as a<strong> modular monolith</strong> and deploy it as a set of microservices.
</p>
<p>
More concretely, Service Weaver consists of two core pieces:
</p>
<ol>

<li>A set of programming libraries, which let you write your application as a single <strong>modular</strong> binary, using only native data structures and method calls, and

</li><li>A set of deployers, which let you configure the runtime topology of your application and deploy it as a set of microservices, either locally or on the cloud of your choosing.</li>

</ol><p>By decoupling the process of writing the application from runtime considerations such as how the application is split into microservices, what data serialization formats are used, and how services are discovered, Service Weaver aims to improve distributed application development velocity and performance.</p><div><h3>Motivation for Building Service Weaver</h3><p>While writing microservices-based applications, we found that the overhead of maintaining multiple<em> </em>different microservice binaries—with their own configuration files, network endpoints, and serializable data formats—significantly slowed our development velocity.</p></div><div><h2>Service Weaver Overview</h2><ol>









</ol><p>The core idea of Service Weaver is its <b>modular monolith </b>model. You write a single binary, using only language-native data structures and method calls. You organize your binary as a set of modules, called <b>components</b>, which are native types in the programming language. For example, here is a simple application written in Go using Service Weaver. It consists of a <span>main()</span> function and a single <span>Adder</span> component:</p></div><div><p>When it is time to run your application, Service Weaver allows you to run it anywhere—on your local desktop environment or on your local rack of machines or in the cloud—without any changes to your application code. This level of portability is achieved by a clear separation of concerns built into the Service Weaver framework. On one end, we have the programming framework, used for application development. On the other end, we have various <b>deployer</b> implementations, one per deployment environment.</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><center><img alt="Flow chart depicting Service Weaver Libraries deployer implementations across three separate platforms in one single iteration" data-original-height="1504" data-original-width="720" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiaj4EkVYzLVZkfeSlWH2K2Wr0zAYLXP32uuDDXj55y_Ng5TmZb9hLXHg87Gr6cqU_ngDay1GWZlRSCSVG0ppP966-Glptki3dqLjDrIvJspcnvI0ZPjA_216-H-JCHyXa_ByRzIu9-VO-Mxu-4uyoCpuQY1WL5XBQ5SVM3Dg9O52aUKlC8uamFLpE9/s1600/Service%20Weaver%20Deployers%20%281%29.png" td=""/></center></td></tr><tr><td><i></i></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>This separation of concerns allows you to run your application locally in a single process via <span>go run .;</span> or run it on Google Cloud via weaver <span>gke deploy;</span><span> </span>or enable and run it on other platforms. In all of these cases, you get the same application behavior without the need to modify or re-compile your application.</p><h2>What’s in Service Weaver v0.1?</h2><p>
The v0.1 release of  Service Weaver includes:
</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://github.com/ServiceWeaver/weaver" target="_blank">core Go libraries</a> used for writing your applications.

</li><li>A number of deployers used for running your applications <a href="https://github.com/ServiceWeaver/weaver/tree/main/cmd/weaver" target="_blank">locally</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ServiceWeaver/weaver-gke" target="_blank">on GKE</a>.

</li><li>A <a href="https://github.com/ServiceWeaver/weaver/tree/main/runtime" target="_blank">set of APIs</a> that allow you to write your own deployers for any other platform.
</li></ul><p>
All of the libraries are released under the Apache 2.0 license. Please be aware that <strong>we are likely to introduce breaking changes<em> </em></strong>until version v1.0 is released.
</p><h2>Get Started and Get Involved</h2><p>
