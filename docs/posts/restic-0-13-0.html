        <p><span>26 Mar 2022</span></p><p>Weâ€™re proud to announce that <a href="https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.13.0">restic 0.13.0</a> has been released today!</p>
<p>This release contains several bug fixes and improvements worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to add negative patterns to cancel previous exclusions (e.g. <code>--exclude &#39;/home/user/*&#39; --exclude &#39;!/home/user/.config&#39;</code>).</li>
<li>The <code>backup</code> command now has a <code>--dry-run</code> switch which (together with <code>--verbose</code>) prints the files that would be included in a backup.</li>
<li>We have added checksums for various backends so data uploaded to a backend can be checked there.</li>
<li>The <code>restore</code> command was optimized and is now twice as fast, the <code>copy</code> command was improved as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>For downloading the new release and to see a more detailed list of important changes, please head over to <a href="https://github.com/restic/restic/releases/v0.13.0">GitHub</a>. If you already have restic (0.9.4 or later), you can use the <code>self-update</code> command to automatically download and verify the new release.</p>
