    <h1>Building a Homelab - Part 3: Nix</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>In the <a href="https://blog.aos.sh/2021/05/23/building-a-homelab-part-2-networking/">previous
post</a>, we went over the networking setup. To summarize, it contains 3 VLANs:
one to manage the network, one for our homelab, and one for guest/IoT devices.
The hosts are connected to a switch, which in turn is connected to a router
speaks to the WAN. I mentioned in passing last time that I would be using
Proxmox. The time has come and gone for that, and we’re now fully on
<a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a>. It’s not a hypervisor, but seeing as I will be mostly
hosting Kubernetes, I don’t need VMs and can go full bare-metal.</p>
<h2 id="nixos">NixOS</h2>
<p>I’ve been on the Nix hype train for the better part of a few years now, and
honestly, I can’t go back. Being able to declaratively manage all of my
infrastructure makes things much simpler. Yes, I understand that the initial
learning curve for Nix is steep, but it’s so worth it friend.</p>
<p>To provision the hosts with NixOS, I used
<a href="https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-anywhere">nixos-anywhere</a> along with a
NixOS disk image. Boot the host with the disk image, then run <code>nixos-anywhere</code>
from your machine targetting that host. This should do most of the hard work.
With NixOS you need to provide a configuration for that host to use, and
<code>nixos-anywhere</code> takes it one step further and gives you the option to
configure the disk(s) as well via
<a href="https://github.com/nix-community/disko">disko</a>.</p>
<p>(I want to pause here and caution if this is your first foray into Nix, I don’t
recommend this approach. Much better to manually install NixOS from the disk
image to get a better understanding of the moving parts.)</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>My host configuration can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/aos/nix-config/blob/1ad7ad6e114a7295fa08de79eda3eb8c97bc4f4e/flake.nix#L72">nix-config repo here</a>.</p>
<p>The configuration is structured in a way that allows me to import certain
generalized “roles” that hosts assume, which can then be tuned with some knobs.
In Nix parlance, these roles are typically called <strong>modules</strong>. An example would
be NFS, where in I create an <a href="https://github.com/aos/nix-config/blob/master/modules/nixos/nfs.nix">NFS “role”</a>
with options for mountpoint, folder, and endpoint. Then, in the host
configuration, I <a href="https://github.com/aos/nix-config/blob/c6db43d6cfd825f7e0bdfd3276077f257f38016c/hosts/samira/default.nix#L15-L19">import it and set these
options</a>. To partially spoil the next part, this is also how we’ll configure our <code>k3s</code> cluster!</p>
<p>To deploy updates to the hosts, I use <a href="https://clan.lol/">clan</a>. I
probably don’t use 99% of the features of <code>clan</code>, but it’s served the purpose
so far. I’ve considered moving to something like
<a href="https://github.com/zhaofengli/colmena">colmena</a>, which is focused purely on
deployment.</p>
<h2 id="next-step">Next step</h2>
<p>With our hosts provisioned, we can now move on to bringing up Kubernetes using
<code>k3s</code>. Fortunately for us, the Nix community has done a lot of the hard work of
creating a <code>k3s</code> module, and we can use that to help us get up and running
quicker. Tune in next time.</p>
