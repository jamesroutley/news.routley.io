    <h1>The Hidden Worlds of the Klein Tools TI250 Thermal Imager</h1>

          There comes a time in every hobbyist’s life when they find themselves in need of a good thermal imaging camera. Most of us would probably follow the same workflow to pick one out: Visit any online retailer, search for “thermal camera” and sort by lowest price. If you do that on certain websites, you’ll find pages of results that look like kits somebody assembled at their kitchen table, followed by more results produced by companies with names that contain the wrong number of vowels. If you keep scrolling, you’ll eventually find the same first viable candidate that I did, the <strong>Klein Tools TI250</strong> Rechargeable Thermal Imager.
        </p>
        <p>
          Klein Tools is a manufacturer of hand tools for professional electricians, and they’ve been in that business for over a century and a half. Are they the best at it? Ehh, depends who you ask. Are they a real brand with a reputation to uphold? They sure are, especially compared to competitors like “Happlignly” (which was an honest-to-God result at the time of this writing). Klein isn’t <em>really</em> known for software engineering or hardware design, but I decided to give them a chance and see what it was all about.
        </p>
        <p>
          The TI250 can be had for $299, and boasts a few features I was specifically looking for. It’s a true thermal imager, which means it presents a two-dimensional picture of the temperature at every point in its field of view. Compare it to an image taken by a regular photographic camera:
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          The resolution of the screen is 320x240 pixels, although the specifications claim the thermal sensor has “over 10,000 pixels” on it. Dusting off my high school algebra, I’d wager a guess that the sensor is actually 120x90, or 10,800 pixels. These raw thermal pixels are upscaled to the 0.0768 megapixels presented to the user. The only real major inconvenience using it is the fact that it <em>constantly</em> pauses to calibrate itself to the temperature range it is being exposed to, a process that freezes the screen and UI for well over a second. If you don’t swing it around too much, it’s actually not so bad to deal with in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the other features the TI250 has is the ability to save snapshots of the screen onto a microSD card. It’s this feature that ultimately sent me down a pretty deep rabbit hole.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Don’t be a cheapskate
        </h2>
        <p>
          When I first unpacked the unit, I grabbed the nearest unused microSD card and slapped it in there. A quick format, and then I had nothing but trouble. Snapshot requests would hang, pictures would not be saved, the playback menu was missing items, and images would randomly show as half-drawn or zero-byte files when plugged into a computer. In roughly ten attempts to take a picture, only one produced a complete usable file.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was all set to write a scathing article about <em>that</em>, before I realized that I had grabbed such an old, cheap SD card that it did not have the <a href="https://www.sdcard.org/developers/sd-standard-overview/speed-class/">Speed Class markings</a> that most decent cards have nowadays. After swapping in a Class 4 microSD card, all those problems went away permanently. The old card apparently didn’t have sufficient write speed to keep up with what the TI250 was trying to do, and it made everything fall over.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Secret mode
        </h2>
        <p>
          <img src="https://www.scottsmitelli.com/static-articles/2022/debug-mode.png" alt="Image taken in debug/diagnostic mode"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          While fighting with the aforementioned write issue, I stumbled on an interesting startup mode: By holding the <strong>left arrow</strong> button while powering up, the TI250 starts in a debug/diagnostic mode where it shows <strong>fps:</strong> (frames per second) on the display. (It’s usually 7 or 8.) Also, in the <strong>Local Info</strong> settings menu, the firmware version reports as <strong>***V2.09</strong> (instead of the usual <strong>V2.05</strong>) along with a unique 17 digit identifier of some sort. Those are the only obvious differences that I noticed.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Collecting images
        </h2>
        <p>
          Okay, back to the saved pictures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a number of image files have been saved on the microSD card, there are two ways to get them out. You can either plug the TI250 into a computer via USB (where it behaves as a removable disk) or you can plug the microSD card directly into a card reader. The end result is the same thing: You get a FAT32 volume containing an <code>Images</code> directory, and inside that is… a bunch of <code>.bmp</code> files. The images from the TI250 are saved as uncompressed bitmap images, with the date/time of capture encoded in the file name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, since each of these images is only 320x240 with a 16-bit color depth, the amount of space used isn’t too bad — 320 * 240 * (16 / 8) = 150 KiB, plus a little extra for the bitmap header. No big deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except all the images that come out of this thing are 225 KiB.
        </p>
        <h2>
          75 KiB of… what, exactly?
        </h2>
        <p>
          With computer memory measured in gigabytes and storage measured in terabytes, a 75 kibibyte difference is less than a rounding error’s rounding error. But here, it accounts for one third of the file. There’s something in here beyond the bitmap pixels that show on the screen. To the hex viewer mobile!

          Every <a href="https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/">bitmap file</a> starts with a rigidly defined 14-byte header structure. Like most things designed around descendants of the original IBM PC, all the values are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little-endian</a>. The bytes from this particular image have the following interpretation:

          We’ve now parsed the entire header structure of the bitmap image, finding nothing unusual. There is a 14-byte header, followed by a 40-byte header, then 153,600 bytes of pixel data for a 320x240x16bpp uncompressed image. Everything in the front of the file is correct and self-corroborating. Whatever’s happening here, it’s happening in the back half of the file.

          Let’s jump to the 153,654th byte in the file, which should be the first byte outside of the known universe according to the bitmap header. In hex, this is around offset 0x25836:

          Oookay. The upper chunk of the hex view is the last 19 pixels of the image data. Each of these is either 0x824 or 0x823, which is sensible for our image. It’s essentially a horizontal span of pixels where everything is more or less the same color.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Color” is kind of an interesting thing to mention here, but it becomes important now. Very briefly, screen colors are produced by varying levels of three “primary” colors: <strong>red</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, and <strong>blue</strong>. By mixing these three channels in different proportions, all colors can be reproduced. <em>However,</em> the astute may have noticed that we use 16 bits, or two bytes, to store the intensity values of three colors. These numbers don’t divide evenly, and indeed the channels are not encoded evenly either — red and blue are each given five bits for each pixel, and green gets six bits. There is a scientific basis to this, in that human eyes are more sensitive to variations in green colors than either red or blue. The bit packing for each pixel is then RRRR RGGG GGGB BBBB. Again, these are stored little-endian, so it’s practically impossible to intuit the visual appearance of colors by glancing at the hex view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, once we fall off the end of the bitmap data, intuition is really all we have to go on. Let’s scroll.

          It’s hard to show the full picture without boring everybody, but there’s a pattern in the ASCII view that repeats just about every 240 bytes. It’s obviously not an identical repetition of bytes each time, but it definitely has a repeating “shape” to it. This pattern continues for almost the entire remainder of the file. Thinking briefly, a 240-byte pattern fits into 75 KiB just about 320 times… I bet there’s another image here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, this has to be an 8-bit image if it’s encoding 320x240 pixels in only 75 KiB of data. Typically 8-bit images are grayscale, with the byte value being applied uniformly to the red/green/blue channels. In this configuration, 0 would be black, 255 would be white, and anything in between would be a shade of gray. So let’s see what it looks like:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="https://www.scottsmitelli.com/static-articles/2022/extraction-attempt-1.png" alt="Extraction attempt #1"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hmm. Maybe it’s not a 320x240 image. Is it a <em>240x320</em> image?
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="https://www.scottsmitelli.com/static-articles/2022/extraction-attempt-2.png" alt="Extraction attempt #2"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed it is. Apparently the image data is stored in column-major order (compared to the row-major order that would typically be expected in raster images). What’s even more interesting is, this data does not have any of the overlays that are present in the bitmap image. This looks like the raw thermal data that came from the sensor without any of the coloring or overlay information added by the TI250’s firmware.
        </p>
        <p>
          This image isn’t actually 100% correct — by looking closely, one might be able to tell that the left edge of the picture contains a discontinuity that’s three pixels wide. It looks like this data doesn’t actually start immediately after the end of the BMP image data. There are three null bytes separating the end of the bitmap from the start of the thermal data. By skipping over them, and rotating the image back to its correct orientation, the image looks good!
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="https://www.scottsmitelli.com/static-articles/2022/extraction-attempt-3.png" alt="Extraction attempt #3"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a few properties about the thermal data that seem to always hold true:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The coldest part of the image <em>always</em> has value 0. The data is never biased away from zero.
          </li>
          <li>The hottest part of the image is <em>usually</em> 254, but sometimes can be quite a bit lower. It never seems to be 255.
          </li>
          <li>Even in highly-contrasted images, it appears as though every value between 0 and the highest value is used. That means if the high point in a given image has value 254, <em>every value</em> from 0 to 254 appears <em>somewhere</em> in that data. Even while taking some extremely contrived and stupid snapshots, I could not find an instance where this didn’t occur. This implies that there is some kind of smoothing or resampling involved in scaling the image from the sensor’s 120x90 to the saved 320x240 resolution.
          </li>
        </ul>

          So that explains 230,457 bytes of our 230,995 byte file. There are still 538 mystery bytes to investigate. We begin here:

          Once again, this looks like a pattern. The data seems to be arranged in two-byte pairs that are “gently” increasing. How high does it go?
        </p>

</pre>
        <p>
          It gets to 0xDE 0xF7 before snapping back down to 0x01. This happens exactly 0x200 bytes from where the pattern started. That implies there are 256 samples of 16-bit values here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Could it be a palette? What happens if we decode each value to a color using the 5 red/6 green/5 blue bit packing used by the BMP format itself?
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="https://www.scottsmitelli.com/static-articles/2022/palette-rainbow.png" alt="Rainbow palette"/>
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s our palette! This means that, if we wanted to, we could map the palette values onto the thermal data to reconstruct the colorized version of the image without the overlays.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the default “rainbow” palette. There are also user-selectable “Ironbow” and “Gray” (sometimes referred to as “white-hot”) palettes that can be extracted from other images…
        </p>

          …and those can be mapped onto the thermal data the same way:

          Very nice indeed. But if you’ve learned anything from reading this far, you know that there’s always more.

          I won’t go into a long account of how I determined the purpose of these values. Suffice it to say it took dozens of images, and flipping pretty much every setting in the UI to determine what changed each time.

          This data encodes, in a machine readable format, all of the information that is normally shown in text/icon overlays on the screen. Like the rest of the BMP format, all multibyte values are stored in little-endian order with the least significant bytes written first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Temperatures are interesting, in that they are always stored in degrees Celsius (regardless of the user’s settings) scaled by a factor of 10 to keep tenths of degrees. A temperature of 70.5 °F would be encoded as 213 (21.3 °C with the decimal shifted one place to the right). Temperatures may be negative, expressed as two’s compliment values (so 0xFFB9 for -71, indicating -7.1 °C or 19.2 °F). The emissivity setting has a somewhat similar encoding, where a setting of 0.9 would be encoded as 90 (the decimal shifts <em>two</em> places to the right as this field has hundredths precision). This allows for storing numbers with a fixed fractional part while still keeping everything in integer form.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scale high/low temperatures are the endpoints of the color scale, not necessarily the coldest and hottest temperatures sampled in the picture. As a concrete example, if the scale low/high temperatures are 60 °F and 80 °F respectively, but the highest value seen in the thermal data is only 128 (half of the overall scale available) the true temperature of the hottest point is around 70 °F. Visually, this would present itself as an image containing none of the “hot” colors from the upper half of the palette.
        </p>
        <p>
          The minimum/maximum temperature points are encoded as a set of X,Y pairs interpreted in the coordinate space of the device’s sensor with 0,0 in its top-left corner. This essentially means that while the origin of the <em>sensor</em> is in the expected top-left position, the rotated <em>screen</em> space moves that origin to the top-right. To correctly interpret this data:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Read the thermal data as a 240x320 image in row major order.
          </li>
          <li>Rotate that image 90 degrees clockwise, producing a 320x240 image in screen orientation.
          </li>
          <li>With the 0,0 origin at the screen’s top-RIGHT corner, and with increasing coordinate values moving down and to the left, plot the points normally.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Be aware that <em>sometimes</em> the minimum/maximum point position might run off the left or bottom edges of the image by one or two pixels. I can’t tell you why it does that.

        <p>
          This is probably meant for some sort of analysis software, possibly to provide the necessary reference information to rescale and normalize images once they have been taken. I’m not aware of any official or unofficial software that supports doing this for the TI250, but hopefully this information will be of use to anybody who wants to explore that space.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Borrow my tools
        </h2>
        <p>
          I put together a relatively small Python program that parses a TI250 image file, prints a summary, and optionally regenerates a new variant of the image from the thermal data and a palette. The source is in this <a href="https://gist.github.com/smitelli/8b5602cea0be3830c6f80802b3c4ff5c">GitHub gist</a>. For those who are mainly interested in a reference implementation of a TI250 data parser, almost all of that is in the <code>load()</code> method.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its most basic form, the tool will read the file, print the embedded metadata, and sanity-check the data for internal consistency:
        </p>
        <pre>$ python3 ti250tool.py /path/to/some/ti250/image.bmp
Input filename:         /path/to/some/ti250/image.bmp
Date from filename:     2022-04-09 11:58:00
Image dimensions:       320x240
Detected palette:       ironbow (256 entries)
Display units:          Fahrenheit
Temperature scale:      47.1 F - 84.5 F
Center temperature:     75.9 F
Highest thermal value:  254
Emissivity:             0.95
Min temperature point:  (81, 231)
Max temperature point:  (126, 63)
Sanity check passed!
</pre>
        <p>
          Use <code>-s</code> / <code>--skip-sanity</code> to skip the sanity checks if they fail. (Please send me a copy of any image that fails a sanity check so I can figure out what I missed!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Add <code>-o OUT_FILE</code> / <code>--out-file OUT_FILE</code> to generate a new image based on the thermal data and stored palette data, without any UI overlay information. The output image format is selected based on the file extension provided in <code>OUT_FILE</code> (<code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code>, and <code>.bmp</code> are all fine choices; anything PIL supports on your system should work).
        </p>
        <p>
          To ignore the stored palette data and force the output file to be drawn in a different palette, add <code>-f</code> / <code>--force-palette</code> followed by one of <code>gray</code>, <code>ironbow</code>, or <code>rainbow</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To bypass the palette entirely and output the raw thermal samples directly, use <code>-r</code> / <code>--raw-output</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add a blue marker at the minimum temperature point, and/or a red marker at the maximum temperature point, pass <code>-n</code> / <code>--draw-min</code> and/or <code>-x</code> / <code>--draw-max</code>, respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some combinations of these options don’t make sense and will not be honored. You’ll figure it out.
