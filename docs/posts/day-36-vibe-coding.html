<p>If you use the uBlock Origin extension in Google Chrome or Edge, you should probably start looking for alternative browsers or extensions—either way. A few days ago, users noticed that Google had begun disabling uBlock Origin and other Manifest V2-based extensions as part of the migration to Manifest V3. Now, Microsoft Edge <em>appears</em> to be following suit.</p>

<p>The latest Edge Canary version started disabling Manifest V2-based extensions with the following message: &#34;This extension is no longer supported. Microsoft Edge recommends that you remove it.&#34; Although the browser turns off old extensions without asking, you can still make them work by clicking &#34;Manage extension&#34; and toggling it back (you will have to acknowledge another prompt).</p>

            <p>At this point, it is not entirely clear what is going on. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/google-to-begin-phasing-out-manifest-v2-extensions-in-chrome-on-june-3/">Google started phasing out Manifest V2 extensions</a> in June 2024, and it has a clear roadmap for the process. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/developer-guide/manifest-v3">Microsoft&#39;s documentation</a>, however, still says &#34;TBD,&#34; so the exact dates are not known yet. This leads to some speculating about the situation being one of &#34;unexpected changes&#34; coming from Chromium. Either way, sooner or later, Microsoft will ditch MV2-based extensions, so get ready as we wait for Microsoft to shine some light on its plans.</p>

<p>Another thing worth noting is that the change does not appear to be affecting Edge&#39;s stable release or Beta/Dev Channels. For now, only Canary versions disable uBlock Origin and other MV2 extensions, leaving users a way to toggle them back on. Also, the uBlock Origin is <a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ublock-origin/odfafepnkmbhccpbejgmiehpchacaeak">still available</a> in the Edge Add-ons store, <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-rolls-out-revamped-edge-add-ons-website/">which recently received a big update</a>.</p>

<p>In August 2024, when Google started flagging uBlock Origin as unsupported, the extension&#39;s maker stepped in and <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/ublock-origin-developer-recommends-switching-to-ublock-lite-as-chrome-flags-the-extension/">recommended users switch to uBlock Origin Lite</a>, a Manifest V3-based extension, and accept some of its limitations. Another option is to switch to Firefox. Mozilla recently <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-manifest-v3-adblockers/">announced</a> its plans to keep Manifest V2 extensions working, including uBlock Origin, based on Mozilla Manifesto, which claims that &#34;individuals must have the ability to shape the internet and their own experiences on it.&#34;</p>

<p>Now, users can either switch to a browser that still supports MV2 extensions or move to MV3-based ad blockers. Of course, not all MV2 extensions have &#34;more modern&#34; versions, so for many, switching to Firefox or another browser with MV2 support will be the only option to keep old extensions working.</p>
