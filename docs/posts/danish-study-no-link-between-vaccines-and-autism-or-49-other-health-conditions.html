<p>An extensive new Danish register-based study - the largest of its kind - supports the safety of the national childhood immunization program. Analyzing data from over 1 million children, the study found no increased risk of autism, asthma, or autoimmune diseases in vaccinated children.</p>
<p>“Our results are reassuring. By analyzing data from more than one million Danish children, we found absolutely no indication that the very small amount of aluminum used in the childhood vaccination program increases the risk of 50 different health outcomes during childhood,” says Anders Hviid, Head of Department at Statens Serum Institut (SSI) and principal investigator on the study.</p>
<p>Aluminum, used as an adjuvant to enhance the immune response, has been a component in some vaccines since the 1930s.</p>
<p>Researchers from SSI used Denmark’s unique national health registers to follow children born between 1997 and 2018, investigating the associations between aluminum-containing vaccines and a total of 50 health outcomes - including asthma, allergies, autoimmune conditions, and neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p>“This is the first study of this scale and with such comprehensive analyses, and it confirms the strong safety profile of the vaccines we’ve used for decades in Denmark,” says Anders Hviid.</p>
<p>“In an era marked by widespread misinformation about vaccines, it is crucial to rely on solid scientific evidence. Large, population-based register studies like this one - tracking more than a million children over many years - is a bulwark against the politicization of health science which undermines public trust in vaccines. It is absolutely essential to distinguish real science from politically motivated campaigns - otherwise, it is the children who will end up paying the price,” says Anders Hviid.</p>
