    <h1>Tell HN: My kid&#39;s school installed spyware and I can&#39;t remove it</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>My middle schooler goes to Chicago Public Schools. They use Google Classroom for assignments and other communications.<p>I bought him a Chromebook for schoolwork, but also for other private things. When we logged in, the system installed GoGuardian monitoring software on the Chromebook without notice or permission.</p><p>And now I can&#39;t remove it. I wrote to GoGuardian support, and they replied that I had to contact the school or remove my son as a user. The instructions for removing him as a user do not work; on the contrary, I see the message &#34;cps.edu manages this user and may remotely manage settings and monitor user activity&#34; and he can&#39;t be removed.</p><p>I did a full factory reset, signed in to his account again, and now the system is once again locked down.</p><p>So now I&#39;m in the position where I have to ask permission from a local government entity to please let me install stuff and don&#39;t monitor the computer I bought and paid for.</p><p>Does anyone know how to refer these people to law enforcement for prosecution?</p></div></div>
