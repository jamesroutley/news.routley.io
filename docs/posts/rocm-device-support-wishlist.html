        <p dir="auto"><strong>Chicken and egg.</strong>  I don&#39;t own any of your hardware because I can&#39;t run the software I want to run. Support Flux, Stable Diffusion, Tencent Hunyuan Video, Nvidia Cosmos, and I&#39;ll be in the market to buy your cards. As it stands, I can&#39;t leverage your offering.  I&#39;ll gladly build AMD workstations if your hardware can do the things I want.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Prioritize VRAM.</strong> The next battle is local image and video models. Nobody wants to use hosted SaaS and all the film and VFX people will be running local Comfy, Hunyuan, etc. in just a few years time. These models need a tremendous amount of VRAM, so you need to build consumer/prosumer SKUs that have it.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you time this right and build high VRAM consumer cards with broad software support, the next generation of media production could ride on your platform.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let me underscore: you <em>must</em> be able to run popular image and video models.</p>
