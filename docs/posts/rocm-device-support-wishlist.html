        <p dir="auto">You know, the reason AMD is way behind Nvidia in market share is because Nvidia literally supports every single discrete graphics processor model with CUDA from the low end to their high end.  They realized what AMD never has, and has continuously annoyed people, especially Linux users.  Not everyone writing software for CUDA has an ultra high end GPU product <em>because they can&#39;t afford them</em>.  But they have a very robust software development community where the underlying SDKs largely just works.  Intel has effectively realized the same thing with ARC.</p>
<p dir="auto">If AMD can&#39;t at least match the Linux support matrix with the Windows support matrix going forward you&#39;re rapidly going to grow completely irrelevant with new generations of software tinkerers who are primarily writing software on Linux. Windows from a compute performance point of view is demonstrably poor in comparison, and the user experience is degrading over time as Microsoft lets their OS foundation crumble while they&#39;re off chasing unicorns.</p>
<p dir="auto">What&#39;s my vote?  Every GPU currently under active driver support including Vega. Vega still has a fairly large-ish install base.  Arbitrary decisions to drop support may make business decisions, but it annoys customers who buy hardware only to have it dropped from support not long after it was still being sold.  But if you must narrow down your support matrix everything from the RX 5000 series and newer.  Either actually compete with the CUDA hardware support experience or get out of the game.  Those are your only options because that&#39;s the market you&#39;re trying to grow and Nvidia is the dominant player.</p>
<p dir="auto">Edit addendum:  If there aren&#39;t the resources to grant official support for every supported GPU then <em>work with the open source community as a resource rather than an adversary.</em>  Give them the tools to grow ROCm/HIP support for the hardware you don&#39;t have the financial and time resources to verify functional support.  Right now, the GPU vendors are ignoring the biggest resources right under their noses by restricting documentation access.  Work directly with the OpenCL projects, Blender Foundation, PyTorch, etc.  If nothing else help them support RDNA1, 2, &amp;3 going forward where most of their user base is.  Reach your customers where they actually are, not where some bean headed accountant out of touch with market realities thinks drives the market.  Because, as Nvidia discovered way back with the GTX 7000 series, and Intel has recently with oneAPI by observing Nvidia, today&#39;s gaming customers and tinkerers are tomorrow&#39;s HPC programmers and 3D artists.</p>
