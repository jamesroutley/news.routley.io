        <p dir="auto">As a developer, I&#39;d like AMD to offer support for the latest GPUs (/ iGPUs) and widest range of cards. I would also like the Windows and Linux (and WSL) support lists to be the same. I would like support for laptop GPUs because I find working on a laptop more convenient (and everyone at my workplace uses them) and I would like iGPU support so that I could buy a laptop with an AMD CPU and an NVIDIA GPU and use it to develop for both CUDA and ROCm (or, more correctly, develop with CUDA and test on ROCm/HIP).</p>
<p dir="auto">Which leads me to this: I always develop on NVIDIA hardware, because most of the market, on both server and client side, is NVIDIA GPUs. In my current job, where I write something that will run on the cloud or on custom-specced PCs, NVIDIA is naturally an easier choice, because AMD just doesn&#39;t offer the ease of development that NVIDIA does. In my previous job, where I wrote consumer software with OpenCL and Direct3D, I found AMD easier and liked it better, but I still spent most of my time on NVIDIA hardware, because that&#39;s the market. (Disclaimer: the software I wrote at my previous job didn&#39;t run on Linux. It ran Windows, Mac OS, and even Android, to an extent, but it didn&#39;t address Linux.)</p>
<p dir="auto">When it comes to ROCm/HIP, I think that what AMD needs to offer is a path of least resistance, something that would enable developers to address AMD as an afterthought, with as few barriers as possible. In terms of hardware support, this IMO means iGPUs. Ryzen CPUs are quite successful. Desktop ones come with an RDNA 2 iGPU. Laptop ones come with whatever that laptop generation has. A developer using such a platform can have an NVIDIA dGPU and, if AMD supported iGPUs in ROCm/HIP, would still be able to test the AMD part of the software without having to own a separate PC for that purpose.</p>
<p dir="auto">When it comes to Linux support specifically, I think that the best would be to support the same hardware HIP for Windows offers. If I develop for both Windows and Linux, I&#39;d love to be able to develop on Windows and WSL and have the same GPU run both. With the limited Linux support, this is quite difficult to achieve. Windows supports pretty much all desktop RDNA 2 and 3 cards, which IMO is great, even if I&#39;d love official support for laptop dGPUs (which are supported, even if unofficially) and for iGPUs of these architectures. If AMD doesn&#39;t have the resources to support all this on Linux, then at least have architecture-wide support. Do only RDNA 3, but enable it for all RDNA 3 GPUs, so that a 7800 XT, 7700 XT or 7600 would be valid targets development.</p>
<p dir="auto">Edit: On the software side, AMD should add support for CUDA devices on Windows, and ensure that HIP for Windows is reasonably in step with ROCm, so that cross-platform development would be the easiest it can be. Also, regarding hardware support, obviously people would like the widest support possible, but as I see it, people are often willing to upgrade. The important thing is consistency. I would like AMD to define a minimum architecture, and then support everything from that point on.</p>
