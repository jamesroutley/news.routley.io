<p>Some months ago I exploited a vulnerability in the Lua implementation of 
<a href="https://www.factorio.com/" title="Official Page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Factorio</a>
 that <strong>allowed a malicious server to obtain arbitrary execution on clients</strong>. As the vulnerability has been patched for months already (Factorio versions <strong>below 1.1.101</strong> are affected), is time to share the details with the community.</p>
<p>I think this is a very interesting topic, that can serve as an introduction to understand other dynamic languages such as <em>Javascript</em>, where similar ideas are used for exploitation. For this reason, this is an <strong>in-depth</strong> explaination of the vulnerability, so that it can be used by others as a reference to understand how these attacks work.</p>
<p>In addition to this, at the end of the post you will find a <strong>challenge</strong> to practice the techniques explained in this post in a gamified environment, <strong>directly in your browser</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You can jump directly to the challenge:</strong> 
<a href="#your-turn" rel="noopener">Your Turn</a>
</p>

<p>Factorio is a game in which you automate a factory to build a rocket and escape from a planet. Based on their website, they have sold more than 
<a href="https://factorio.com/support/press-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3,500,000 copies of the game</a>
, making it
a juicy target for security researchers</p>

<h2 id="how-is-lua-used-in-the-game">How is Lua used in the game?</h2>
<p>Lua is used in Factorio to implement some game logic and to <strong>create mods</strong> and <strong>custom maps</strong> that can be downloaded from in-game or from their 
<a href="https://mods.factorio.com/" title="Mods Browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>
. The modding community is very active, so there are
<em>thousands</em> of mods available, some with even <strong>more than half a million downloads</strong></p>
<p>

        <source srcset="/posts/rce-lua-factorio/most-downloaded-mod_hu87ef96f0b4805001ffaa3865c33619a2_101420_1157x240_resize_q75_h2_box_3.webp" type="image/webp"/>

<p>Based on this information, it might seem that the surface of the <em>Lua interpreter</em> in the game is limited to <strong>local exploits</strong> that <em>require the user to download a malicious mod</em>. That would already be an issue, as
compromising one mod (either finding a vulnerability in it / compromising the source) has the potential to reach <strong>millions of users</strong>, but we are missing a small detail that <strong>exposes the lua interpreter to the network</strong>, opening the door to more interesting attacks</p>
<h2 id="the-more-the-merrier">The more the merrier</h2>
<p>On the 
<a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Desynchronization" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Factorio wiki</a>
 there is a <strong>very important</strong> implementation detail of the multiplayer mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Factorio multiplayer code uses deterministic lockstep to synchronize clients. This is a method of synchronizing a game from one computer to another by sending only the user inputs that control that game, rather than networking the state of the objects in the game itself. It means that <strong>all player’s games need to simulate every single tick of the game identically</strong>. If any computer does something ever-so-slightly different, a desynchronization (desync) occurs. The game includes processes to ensure any issues with network traffic do not cause desyncs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means that <em>if</em> one player executes some Lua code, the rest of the players <strong>must</strong> execute it in order to preserve the syncronization of the game. Failing to do so will result in a desync state, disconnecting the client from the game with an error message, as also seen in the wiki</p>
<p>
  
    <picture>
        <source srcset="/posts/rce-lua-factorio/desync-report_hu46d39e92e2be0de222db9019c39a011e_60830_1101x192_resize_q75_h2_box.webp" type="image/webp"/>
        <img src="https://ntietz.com/posts/rce-lua-factorio/desync-report_hu46d39e92e2be0de222db9019c39a011e_60830_1101x192_resize_q75_box.jpg" alt="Desync Error" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="same-origin"/>
      </picture>
  </p>
<p>So we now know that any Lua code we execute is also executed by the rest of players. <em>What are our options to execute lua code?</em> After some research, we end up with <strong>two options</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <code>/c</code> command to execute Lua code in a server (if we have <em>permission</em> to do it)</li>
<li>Creating a custom map that <strong>contains lua code</strong> so it gets executed when a client connects to the server</li>
</ol>
<p>As both options require privileges on a server, we might as well go for the second path.</p>
<p>As the game also features an in-game server browser, an attacker could make it visible there to atract victims.</p>

<h2 id="general-exploitation-path">General Exploitation Path</h2>
<p>Now that we have a clear path to reach the Lua interpreter from the network, let’s take a quick look at the general exploitation path that we will follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>We host a Factorio server that is serving a <em>malicious map</em>. This map will contain our exploit as part of the Lua code that defines the scenario of the map</li>
<li>When a client connects to our server, they download the map and <strong>execute the Lua code</strong> associated with it (as we have seen before, as state is not shared, clients need to execute the Lua code to ensure syncronization between them)</li>
<li>Our payload will leverage weaknesses in the Lua implementation to <em>craft fake objects</em></li>
<li>These fake objects will allow us to <em>leak/corrupt</em> memory to alter the behaviour of the program</li>
<li>We follow one of the many techniques to gain code execution by leveraging these powerful primitives</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-small-leak-will-sink-a-great-ship">A small leak will sink a great ship</h2>
<p>As one can imagine, the official 
<a href="https://www.lua.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lua interpreter</a>
 contains <em>modules</em> that allow scripts to interact with the host in multiple common ways, such as opening files, executing commands, getting environment variables… While this might be desirable on normal circumstances, is definitely not okay when executing untrusted code. For this reason, a basic hardening recommendation is to <em>completely disable these modules</em> when compiling Lua for those sensitive environments.</p>
<p>This is the case in Factorio too, where only the following modules are compiled:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debug</a>
 - Provides Access to Debug functionalities</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">math</a>
 - Interface to standard C Math</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bit32</a>
 - Bitwise operations</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">string</a>
 - Manipulation of strings</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">table</a>
 - Manipulation of tables</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#6.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base</a>
 - Core Functions of Lua, such as <code>print</code></li>
</ul>
<p>However, the devil is in the details, and while modules that have names like <code>os</code> with functions like <code>execute</code> are easily recognizable are <strong>dangerous</strong>, others like <code>load</code> or <code>loadstring</code> that are part of the <code>base</code> module might be seem as benign, while they are arguably <strong>the most powerful functions of Lua</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Why are these functions so powerful?</em> Because they allow executing <strong>bytecode</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="who-controls-the-bytecode-controls-the-future">Who controls the Bytecode controls the future</h3>
<p>Lua is an <em>interpreted language</em>, but it doesn’t execute the code we write as it is, first, <strong>it is compiled</strong>. This might be a surprise to some, as it seems to be incompatible with the classic view of an interpreted language. However, details are important, <strong>Lua doesn’t compile to machine code</strong>, that is, code that your CPU understands. Instead, it compiles into <em>Lua bytecode</em>, which is a representation of the code that can only be executed by the Lua interpreter, making it still an interpreted Language.</p>
<p>Source code is useful for humans, as it is easily readable, but text is hard to work with for computers, so bytecode is a more useful representation for them.</p>
<p>Let’s see this in practice so we get a clearer view of how this works.</p>
<p>If we have the following code:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span>print(<span>&#34;MemoryCorruption&#34;</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Lua is going to generate and execute the following bytecode:</p>

<p>All the bytecode snippets in this post were created with <code>luac -l -l &lt;script&gt;</code>. <strong>luac</strong> is provided together with the Lua interpreter
</p>

<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span><span>1</span>	GETTABUP	<span>0</span> <span>0</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>	; _ENV <span>&#34;print&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>2</span>	LOADK	<span>1</span> <span>-</span><span>2</span>        ; <span>&#34;MemoryCorruption&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>3</span>	CALL	<span>0</span> <span>2</span> <span>1</span>	
</span></span><span><span><span>4</span>	RETURN	<span>0</span> <span>1</span>	
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Without knowing anything about bytecode, we can see that somehow Lua is getting the function <code>print</code>, loading a constant <code>MemoryCorruption</code>, calling print and finally returning.</p>
<p>This bytecode is what gets executed by the interpreter, there are no more conversions or <em>checks</em>. This is why being able to execute bytecode directly is <strong>so powerful</strong>, because you gain the
ability to execute <strong>incorrect bytecode</strong> that under normal circunstances, the compiler <strong>would never generate</strong></p>
<p>For example, what happens if I modify the previous <code>LOADK</code> opcode, that is used to load a constant to use a <strong>Out-Of-Bounds index</strong>? Does the interpreter prevents me from doing that? Or does it leak memory?</p>
<h2 id="bytecode-verifier">Bytecode Verifier</h2>
<p>Aware of the dangers of directly executing bytecode, Lua developers implemented a bytecode verifier in an attempt to protect the interpreter from malicious bytecode. However, it was removed in version 5.2 as it was repeatedly found to be bypassable</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Following several bytecode exploits found by the relentless Peter Cawley
and others, we are considering dropping the bytecode verifier completely in
Lua 5.2. It seems useless to make a promise that we can’t seem to deliver
without a much more complicated verifier than the current one, and possibly
with the need for costly runtime checks as well.</p>
<p>Our impression is that applications that are open to running arbitrary Lua
code provided by the user should avoid accepting precompiled scripts. So we
think that adding a flag to load (the Lua function from the base library)
to check for and reject precompiled scripts is enough for Lua-based apps
to be able to reject precompiled scripts if they want to. We don’t think
anything else is needed in the C side, since you can always write you own
lua_Reader function to reject precompiled scripts.</p>
<p>At the same time, shedding the bytecode verifier would allow applications
that run their own precompiled scripts that are deemed safe to avoid the
cost of the bytecode verifier. The checks would be limited to the sanity
tests done in lundump.c, which should be enough for flagging accidental
file corruption.</p>
<p>All feedback is welcome.  Thanks.

</blockquote>
<p>Even if the official bytecode verifier was not implemented in Lua 5.2.1, Factorio developers seem to have implemented their own in an attempt to protect the Lua interpreter<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. These protections focused primarly in avoiding clearly <strong>OOB parameters</strong>, like trying to jump outside the code or loading a constant with an index bigger than the constants array</p>
<p>This bytecode verifier had some <strong>Off-By-One</strong> issues, as some opcodes can be a little confusing. For example, <code>JMP 0</code> does not really make sense, as it would basically make
an infinite loop, so the jump opcode is <strong>offset by one by default</strong>. This wasn’t taken into account in the verifier, so it was possible to jump outside the code block.</p>
<p>This was an issue by itself as there exists the possiblity that the constants are allocated just after the code chunk, so an attacker could <strong>store bytecode in the constants section</strong> to bypass the checks and then jump to it with the off by one. As Lua ignores malformed instructions, the metadata of the chunk would be ignored in most cases, <strong>resulting in execution of the constants as bytecode</strong>.</p>

<p>In interpreted languages such as <em>Javascript</em> and <em>Lua</em>, an <em>incredibly powerful primitive</em> is the ability to create <strong>fake objects</strong>. This is because it allow us to <strong>leverage the full power of the interpreter in our advantage</strong>; Strings can be used to leak arbitrary data, arrays allow to write to arbitrary memory and if the language has a way to call native functions, we can use it to control the execution flow.</p>
<p>In addition to this, <em>exploitation can be as complex as we need</em>, as our exploit can make decisions and calculate values dynamically, because at the end we are still executing <em>Javascript/Lua</em> code.</p>
<p>For these reasons, our goal is to gain the ability to create these <strong>fake objects</strong>.</p>
<p>To fulfil this goal, we basically need two things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The ability to leak addresses</strong>: this will allow to place our fake objects in strings, as we will be able to locate them in memory</li>
<li><strong>A way to retrieve an object from an address</strong>: if we can retrieve an object from an arbitrary address, we can use the addresses leaked to get fake objects</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="leaking-addresses">Leaking Addresses</h2>
<p>Normally, leaking addresses in Lua is a feature of the print function:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span>[MemoryCorruption src] .<span>/</span>lua <span>-</span>e <span>&#39;function foo() end print(foo)&#39;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>function</span>: <span>0x1673490</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, not only this was <strong>removed in Factorio</strong>, it also <em>doesn’t leak the address of strings</em>, which we want to use to store our fake objects. That means that we will have to craft our own primitive to leak addresses.</p>
<p>A common way to leak addresses in Lua is by <strong>leveraging type confusions between objects</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-tvalues">Introduction to TValues</h3>
<p>To understand how a type confusion leads to leaking addresses, we first need to understand how objects internally work in Lua.</p>
<p>As we know, Lua is a <strong>dynamic language</strong>, so a variable can change its type during runtime:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span>foo <span>=</span> <span>&#34;A&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span>print(foo)
</span></span><span><span><span>-- Output: A</span>
</span></span><span><span>foo <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
</span></span><span><span>print(foo)
</span></span><span><span><span>-- Output: 1</span>
</span></span><span><span>foo <span>=</span> print
</span></span><span><span>print(foo)
</span></span><span><span><span>-- Output: function</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>However, Lua is written in <strong>C</strong>, which is a <strong>static language</strong>, that means that the type of variables is <strong>set on stone after compilation</strong>. How is possible to build a dynamic language on a static one? Like most things in Computer Science, by adding another <strong>abstration</strong> layer.</p>
<p>Internally in Lua, objects are represented with the <code>TValue</code> structure</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c++"><span><span>pwndbg<span>&gt;</span> ptype TValue
</span></span><span><span>type <span>=</span> <span>struct</span> <span>lua_TValue</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    Value value_;
</span></span><span><span>    <span>int</span> tt_;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Where the <code>tt_</code> attribute defines the type of the <code>TValue</code> and the <code>Value</code> attribute is used to access the object represented by the <code>TValue</code>.</p>
<p>As we can see, by doing this, Lua can easily implement dynamic types. In Lua, <strong>everything is a TValue</strong>, so changing the type of a variable just means replacing one <em>TValue</em> with <em>another TValue</em>. When doing operations with the TValues, Lua just has to check the <code>tt_</code> property to know how to access it and what operations are valid.</p>
<p>Inside the <code>Value</code> union we have the value of a <code>TValue</code>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c++"><span><span>pwndbg<span>&gt;</span> ptype <span>/</span>o Value
</span></span><span><span>type <span>=</span> <span>union</span> <span>Value</span> {
</span></span><span><span><span>/*                     8 */</span>    GCObject <span>*</span>gc;
</span></span><span><span><span>/*                     8 */</span>    <span>void</span> <span>*</span>p;
</span></span><span><span><span>/*                     4 */</span>    <span>int</span> b;
</span></span><span><span><span>/*                     8 */</span>    lua_CFunction f;
</span></span><span><span><span>/*                     8 */</span>    lua_Number n;
</span></span><span><span><span>/* total size (bytes):    8 */</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we can see, it is basically a <em>space</em> of <strong>8 bytes</strong> that is interpreted either as a double or as a pointer to another structure depending on the type of the <code>TValue</code>.</p>
<p>Notice how <strong>numbers are an special case</strong>. Lua represents <strong>all numbers as doubles</strong><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, so there is no need to use a pointer to access it, they can be <strong>stored inline</strong> in the <code>Value</code> union to save space and make access faster, as they have the same size of a pointer.</p>
<p>This detail is <strong>KEY</strong> to leaking pointers in Lua (and also in <strong>V8</strong>!). If we can make Lua think our <code>String</code> is a <code>Number</code>, instead of accessing the <code>Value</code> union as a pointer, it will be accessed as a <em>double</em>. That means that <strong>the pointer of the string will be used as a double</strong>, which might allow us to leak it depending on how is used.</p>
<h3 id="forloop">FORLOOP</h3>
<p>A common place to confuse the types of objects is in loops <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. If we can make Lua think any object passed as the initial start point of a numeric loop is a number,
we could leak its address, as it would be available to us as a variable.</p>
<p>In Lua, loops are implemented by the <code>FORLOOP</code> opcode. This opcode <strong>is always preceded</strong> by a <code>FORPREP</code> opcode on numeric loops that checks the type of the arguments and prepares the loop.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c++"><span><span>vmcase(OP_FORPREP,

</span></span><span><span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That means that if we try to leak the address of a function with a loop without messing with the bytecode…</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span>foo <span>=</span> <span>function</span>(x)

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>As we have seen before, all numbers in Lua are represented as <strong>doubles</strong><sup id="fnref1:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, so when we try to leak a pointer,
<strong>Lua thinks the value is also double</strong>. However, <em>pointers are not doubles</em>, so
they are <strong>not encoded as such</strong>, leading to <em>odd values</em> when used as doubles.</p>
<p>As we already know that Lua doesn’t have integers, we need a way to <strong>properly encode</strong> the pointers as doubles to obtain the real value. And for that,
we first need to <strong>understand what are floating-point numbers</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="ieee-754-double-precision">IEEE 754 double-precision</h4>
<p>Doubles are represented using the <strong>IEEE 754 binary64 format</strong>. In this format, they are formed by three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sign</strong>: 1 bit</li>
<li><strong>Exponent</strong>: 11 bits</li>
<li><strong>Mantissa</strong>: 52 bits</li>
</ul>
<p>

          </p><figcaption>Sign: 1 bit. Exponent: 11 bits. Mantissa: 52 bits</figcaption>
  
<p>So they are basically <strong>64 bits of data</strong>, nothing makes them intrinsically different from an <code>integer</code>, the only difference
is the way bits get interpreted. We already knew this, as this is what allows them to be stored inline in the <code>Value</code> union</p>
<p>This also means that in Python we can just pack it to bytes an then unpack it as a <code>integer</code> to obtain the pointer we leaked, as they have the same size.</p>

<p>This <strong>only works in our case</strong> as the leak is a <em>“fake”</em> floating-point number. Doing this for <em>real</em> floating-point numbers will lead to <strong>errors</strong>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately, with Lua <strong>things gets complicated</strong>. Lua 5.2 doesn’t have the ability to pack/unpack, and more important, <strong>it doesn’t even have integers</strong>.</p>
<p>That means that as we can’t represent our leak as a real <code>integer</code>, beyond <strong>53 bits</strong> we will encounter <strong>precision limitations</strong> when trying to represent integers, as from that point, integers <strong>no longer fit in the mantissa</strong> and only some numbers will not suffer from precision limitations <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. But there is also a <strong>bright side</strong>, we have
<strong>53 bits in which there is no difference between the precision of an integer and a double</strong>.</p>
<p>As <strong>53 bits</strong> <del>ought to be enough for anyone</del> are <strong>enough to leak adresses</strong>, we just need a way to convert <strong>fake doubles to properly encoded doubles</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="from-doubles-to-doubles-the-painful-way">From “Doubles” to Doubles; The Painful Way</h5>
<p>If we had a way to access the bits of the double, the conversion would be easy. However, we can’t use bitwise operations, because <em>what does it even mean to do a bitwise operation on a double?</em> We need to find a different way to obtain the bits of a float</p>
<p>The most comprensible way that I know is by using the <code>string.format</code> method with the <code>%a</code> format string.</p>
<p>This provides us a string containing the <em>double</em> in hexadecimal. We will specifically use <code>%.13a</code> to
force a mantissa of 13 hex characters (52 bits) to be printed so we don’t have to pad it ourselves.</p>

          </p><figcaption>Number is denormalized. Mantissa is <code>000000043c620p</code>. Exponent is <code>-1022</code></figcaption>
  
<p>This uncovers a new interesting fact about floating-point numbers. As we know from the output of the Python code, our leaked value is <code>0x43c620</code>. Which as we can see, is basically the value of the <strong>mantissa</strong>.
<em>But what about the exponent?</em> With our current knowledge of floating-point numbers, <strong>we can’t explain an exponent of -1022</strong>. As far as we know, it <strong>should be zero</strong>, <em>what is happening here?</em></p>
<h5 id="exponent-bias">Exponent Bias</h5>
<p>This discrepancy occurs due to the way floating-point numbers are encoded. The <em>exponent</em> of floating-point numbers use biased representation<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>, which is a way to
encode <strong>signed numbers</strong> by encoding the offset from a number known as the <em>bias</em>: <code>exponent = encoded_value - bias</code></p>
<p>In the case of doubles, this <em>bias</em> is <code>1023</code>, which means that the exponent will take values between <code>-1022</code> and <code>1023</code></p>
<ul>
<li><code>encoded_exp = 00000101010 = 42</code> -&gt; <code>exponent = 42 - 1023 = -981</code></li>
<li><code>encoded_exp = 11111010000 = 2000</code> -&gt; <code>exponent = 2000 - 1023 = 977</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As you might already notice, if the exponent has <strong>11 bits</strong>, that means that it can represent <code>2**11 = 2048</code> possible values, but we are missing <strong>two</strong>, when they are all <code>0</code> and when
they are all <code>1</code>. This is because they have an <strong>especial meaning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>encoded_exp = 00000000000</code> means that the number is <strong>denormalized</strong> (or a <strong>signed zero</strong> if the mantissa is 0)</li>
<li><code>encoded_exp = 11111111111</code> means <strong>Inf</strong> (if mantissa 0) or <strong>NaN</strong> (if mantissa is not zero)</li>
</ul>
<p>This explains <strong>why our pointer has an ood value</strong>. Lua thinks it is a <strong>denormalized</strong> number as the exponent was zero while the mantissa was not zero.</p>
<p>Denormalized numbers are basically <strong>very small numbers</strong>. For a double, they start at values smaller than <code>2**-1022</code> <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span>print(string.format(<span>&#34;%.13a&#34;</span>, <span>2</span><span>^-</span><span>1022</span>))

</span></span><span><span>print(string.format(<span>&#34;%.13a&#34;</span>, <span>2</span><span>^-</span><span>1023</span>))
</span></span><span><span><span>-- Output: 0x0.8000000000000p-1022 (0x0 means denormalized number)</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This is also <strong>why the exponent of our leaked value was -1022</strong>. As our number was denormalized and it was indicated by the first part of the output, the exponent is no longer useful for us (as it only indicated that is denormalized, which we already knew), so it seems to be fixed at <code>-1022</code>, the smallest representable exponent.</p>
<h5 id="are-we-double-yet">Are we double yet?</h5>
<p>There are basically <strong>two cases</strong> we need to handle:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Denormalized Numbers</strong>: the integer value fits in the <em>mantissa</em>, we decode the mantissa to obtain the correct double.</li>
<li><strong>Normal numbers</strong>: the value <em>does not fit in the mantissa</em>. The best we can do to recover the original value is to calculate the number as <code>(exponent + 1023) * 2^52 + mantissa</code> (if the number is not representable as a double, we lose data doing this)</li>
</ul>

<p>If we really wanted to handle <em>any number</em> without losing data, we could store the value in <strong>two doubles</strong> and make functions to operate with them as an <code>integer</code>
</p>

<p>Now that we have a way to leak addresses, we need a primitive that allows us to retrieve fake objects. To do this, we first need to understand how <strong>upvalues</strong> and <strong>Closures</strong> work in Lua.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-upvalues">What are Upvalues?</h3>
<p><strong>Upvalues</strong> are a way <strong>to access variables outside the scope of the current function</strong>. Consider the following example that calculates the Fibonacci secuence:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span><span>function</span> <span>fibonacci</span>(n)
</span></span><span><span>	<span>local</span> a <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>local</span> b <span>=</span> <span>1</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>function</span> <span>nextValue</span>()
</span></span><span><span>     <span>-- &#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39; are upvalues, as they are defined in the outer function</span>
</span></span><span><span>     <span>return</span> a <span>+</span> b
</span></span><span><span>	<span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>for</span> i<span>=</span><span>0</span>, n <span>do</span>
</span></span><span><span>		tmp <span>=</span> a
</span></span><span><span>		a <span>=</span> nextValue()
</span></span><span><span>		b <span>=</span> tmp
</span></span><span><span>	<span>end</span>
</span></span><span><span>	<span>return</span> b
</span></span><span><span><span>end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>nextValue</code> function accesses both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> variables even if they are outside its scope, that is because both variables are defined as upvalues. We can see that this is true by taking a look
at its bytecode:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>upvalues (2) for nextValue:
	0	a	1	1
	1	b	1	2
</code></pre><p>The format of the upvalues section is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Index</strong>: position in the upvalues array of the function</li>
<li><strong>Name</strong>: name of the upval</li>
<li><strong>In Stack</strong>: indicates if the upval is located in the stack (one if located in the stack)</li>
<li><strong>Stack Index</strong>: offset of the upval from the base address of the stack</li>
</ol>
<p>So we know that both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are upvalues located in the stack, with <code>a</code> located at <code>base + 1</code> and <code>b</code> at <code>base + 2</code></p>
<h3 id="the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving">The Gift that Keeps on Giving</h3>
<p>As you might start thinking, we control the bytecode that gets loaded, and <strong>upvalues are defined in the bytecode</strong>, <em>what happens if we modify the index of an upvalue to point to a different offset of the stack?</em></p>
<p>Let’s try it, first we define a function that has three upvalues</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span><span>function</span>()
</span></span><span><span>    <span>local</span> foo
</span></span><span><span>    <span>local</span> bar
</span></span><span><span>    <span>local</span> target
</span></span><span><span>    (<span>function</span>()
</span></span><span><span>      print(foo)
</span></span><span><span>      print(bar)
</span></span><span><span>      print(target)
</span></span><span><span>    <span>end</span>)()
</span></span><span><span><span>end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we execute the code <em>without any modification to the bytecode</em>, we get <code>nil</code> as the output, as the upvalues haven’t been assigned any value yet</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[MemoryCorruption src]$ ./lua poc.lua 
nil
nil
nil
</code></pre><p>Now we are going to <strong>manipulate the index</strong> of the <code>target</code> upval. To do this, we need to know its current position:</p>

<p>The <code>_ENV</code> upvalue is used to get the address of the <code>print</code> function, and is not important for our purposes
</p>

<pre tabindex="0"><code>upvalues (4) for 0xd587a0:
	0	_ENV	0	0
	1	foo	1	0
	2	bar	1	1
	3	target	1	2
</code></pre><p>As it is currently <code>2</code>, we are going to increase it to <code>3</code>. We can do that with this code:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span>poc <span>=</span> string.dump(<span>function</span>()
</span></span><span><span>    <span>local</span> foo
</span></span><span><span>    <span>local</span> bar
</span></span><span><span>    <span>local</span> target
</span></span><span><span>    (<span>function</span>()
</span></span><span><span>      print(foo)
</span></span><span><span>      print(bar)
</span></span><span><span>      print(target)
</span></span><span><span>    <span>end</span>)()
</span></span><span><span><span>end</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>-- Modify upvalue index of target to be idx + 1</span>
</span></span><span><span>poc <span>=</span> poc:gsub(<span>&#34;(</span><span>\x00\x00\x01\x00\x01\x01\x01</span><span>)</span><span>\x02</span><span>&#34;</span>, <span>&#34;%1</span><span>\x03</span><span>&#34;</span>, <span>1</span>)
</span></span><span><span>poc <span>=</span> load(poc)
</span></span><span><span>poc()
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here we <em>dump the bytecode</em> of the function with <code>string.dump</code> and then modify the index of the last upvalue with a substitution. We use <code>&#34;(\x00\x00\x01\x00\x01\x01\x01)\x02&#34;</code> as the pattern because each upvalue has one byte to indicate if it is located in the stack and another to indicate the index, making it unique enough for our purpose.</p>
<p>Execution of the <strong>manipulated bytecode</strong> reveals something interesting:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>[MemoryCorruption src]$ ./lua poc.lua 
nil
nil
LClosure: 0x7a6d00
</code></pre>
<p>An <em>unmodified version of Lua</em> will return <code>function</code> instead of <code>LClosure</code>, as the default <code>print</code> function considers closures functions
</p>

<p>Instead of <code>nil</code>, we got an <code>LClosure</code>, <em>but what is an LClosure?</em> To understand it, <strong>we need to know how functions work in Lua</strong></p>
<h4 id="closures-and-prototypes">Closures and Prototypes</h4>
<p><strong>Prototypes</strong> are created when loading bytecode or when parsing the source code of a Lua script. As such, we could say that <em>prototypes</em> are the <strong>real functions</strong>, as they
contain all the information we would commonly associate with a function, like its bytecode, the start and end line of source code where it was defined, constants used…</p>
<p>They act kinda as a <em>template</em> for functions</p>

upvals</strong> on each call</p>
<p>We can see this mechanism in work with a function that returns a counter:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In this code, the <code>createCounter</code> function returns a new function that can be used to increase an <strong>upvalue</strong> of the <code>createCounter</code> function. As a new <code>count</code> variable is created on each call, the function will
return a different <code>LCLosure</code> when called. The same <strong>prototype</strong> will be used, as <em>they are the same funcion</em>, but a different <strong>upval</strong> will be associated with it <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="wait-is-all-tvalues">Wait, is all TValues?</h4>
<p>By modifying the index of the upvalue, we got a reference to the current function closure, that is because <code>LClosures</code> are <strong>pushed to the stack on creation</strong> and <strong>just before upvalues are asigned to it</strong>.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The position of the <code>LClosure</code> in the stack depends on the opcode <code>CLOSURE</code>, which as the name indicates, is reponsible for the creation of closures in Lua and is defined as:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>R(A) := closure(KPROTO[Bx])
</code></pre><p>This basically means to create a new <strong>Closure</strong> based on the <strong>prototype at position Bx</strong> of the current <em>function prototype</em> array of prototypes (function prototypes are stored in the prototype of the function that defined it), and store it at position <code>R(A)</code>, which is a macro that means <code>base + A</code>, so at an offset from the current function stack (which seems to always be just after the local variables).</p>
<p>This explains why when we modified the index of the last <em>upval</em> we got the <code>LClosure</code> of the function</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>function (4 instructions at 0x225b540)

upvalues (1) for 0x225b540:
	0	_ENV	0	0
</code></pre><p>As our function had <strong>three locals</strong>, the <code>CLOSURE</code> opcode has <code>3</code> as the <code>A</code> parameter, meaning that the <code>LClosure</code> is stored at <code>base + 3</code>. When we modified the last upval to point to the index <strong>3</strong>, we got
the <code>TValue</code> stored at <code>base + 3</code>, that is, the <strong>LClosure</strong>.</p>
<p>As closures are <strong>first class citizens</strong> in Lua, they are also a <code>TValue</code>, so they are no more especial than any other variable.</p>
<h4 id="toctou-type-of-check--type-of-use">TOCTOU: Type of Check != Type of Use</h4>
<p>We just learned that <em>Closures</em> are like any other variable in Lua. This arises a question, <em>what prevents a user from calling a variable like a string as a function and crash Lua?</em></p>
<p>The answer, as you can imagine, is a <strong>type check</strong> when trying to call a <code>TValue</code></p>

<p>As we can see, <strong>the type confusion gives us total control</strong> of both the <code>Proto</code> and <code>Upval</code> pointers, as the user content of a <strong>string</strong> is stored in those offsets.</p>
<p>This is important because we gain control over the <strong>pointer to the function prototype and the array of upvalues of the current frame</strong>. If we point these pointers to an area of memory we control, for example, <em>another string</em>, we could create <strong>fake objects</strong>, the <strong>most powerful primitive in a dynamic language</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="creating-fake-objects">Creating Fake Objects</h3>
<p>From this point, there are two paths, we either create a Fake <code>Proto</code> that points to an array of fake <code>TValues</code>, or we can create a fake <code>UpVal</code> array that points to our <code>TValues</code>. They lead to the same
outcome, so I recomment following the <em>Constants</em> path, as you need <strong>less padding</strong>, and also <strong>regain the ability to use constants</strong> in your function, which is nice</p>

          </p><figcaption>Possible paths to create Fake Objects from a LClosure we control</figcaption>
  
<p>Let’s start by creating a <strong>fake string</strong>. Fake strings are interesting as they can be used as a <strong>read primitive</strong> by creating a one with the <strong>max length possible</strong>.</p>
<p>This is useful in many cases and can even be
the end goal of our exploit (as we might just want to <em>demonstrate access to customer data in memory</em>)</p>
<p>As we will follow the <strong>path of constants</strong>, we need to create:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Fake String</li>
<li>An array of <code>TValues</code>, with one pointing to our fake string</li>
<li>A Fake <code>Proto</code> that points to the Array of <code>TValues</code></li>
<li>A Fake <code>LClosure</code> that points to our fake <code>Proto</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="1-fake-string">1. Fake String</h4>
<p>In Lua, strings are represented with the <code>TString</code> union:</p>

<p>While crafting fake objects, use the definition of the structure provided by GDB, as it includes <strong>paddings</strong>

<li><strong>Tables</strong>: can be used to write data to arbitrary addresses</li>
<li><strong>CCLosure/Light C Functions</strong>: allow to <em>obtain control of the instruction pointer</em>. Which has multiple uses:
<ul>
<li><strong>Bypass sandboxes</strong>: we can recover access to Lua functions that might be sandboxed but still present in the binary by pointing a fake function to its address</li>
<li><strong>Execute ROP Chains</strong>: as we control the instruction pointer, we can execute <em>ROP chains</em></li>

<p>The path to take will depend both on your goals and the application where Lua is embedded.</p>

<h4 id="finishing-our-read-primitive">Finishing our read primitive</h4>
<p>Previously, we created our <strong>first fake object</strong>, a <code>TString</code>. We already said that this is a powerful fake object, as it can be used to leak data, so let’s finish building this read primitive.</p>
<p>To do this, we start by updating the size of our fake string from <code>0x1337</code> to a bigger number, so we can reach more data from its position.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span><span>--  next + tt/marked/extra/padding/hash + len</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, we need to create a function that given a fake string, tries to read from an address we provide. As we already know, Lua assumes that the string is located after the <code>TString</code> header, that means that <strong>we are limited to leaking data after the header</strong>. As <code>TStrings</code> are located in the <em>heap</em>, we will only be able to read data located in the heap or after it.</p>
<p>The following code can be used to read data from an address we provide given a fake string that is within reach of the target:</p>

<p>In Lua, <strong>Strings are indexed starting from 1</strong>. This means that <code>str:sub(0, 1)</code> and <code>str:sub(1, 1)</code> return the same character. To take that into account we will consider the header of the <code>TString</code> one byte smaller
</p>

<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span><span>function</span> <span>read</span>(fake_string, addr, size)

<p>In addition to leaking memory, we would like to <strong>corrupt memory</strong> so we can alter the behaviour of the program.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to do this, so we are going to do the one that I think is the <strong>simplest</strong>.</p>
<p>The idea is to create a <em>fake UpValue</em> that points to the address we want to write. By doing this, Lua will think that the address we provided contains a <code>TValue</code>, so this is similar to the way we crafted fake objects,
but the diference is that instead of retrieving this fake object, we are going to <strong>overwrite it with a numeric value</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Why are we going to do this?</em> Because writing to a variable means to change the <strong>underlying TValue</strong> with a new <code>TValue</code> that represents the new object. As Lua thinks the address we provide contains the <code>TValue</code>
of the variable we are writing to, Lua is going to write the new <code>TValue</code> in that position, and as we already know, <strong>numeric values are stored inline</strong> in the <code>TValue</code> structure, so <strong>we control the first 8 bytes
of the structure that gets written</strong> to the address provided.</p>

</code></pre><h5 id="episode-v---doubles-strike-back">Episode V - Doubles Strike Back</h5>
<p>Now we have the <em>opposite problem</em> to the one we explained at 
<a href="#ieee-754-double-precision" rel="noopener">IEEE-754 Double-precision</a>
. We have a double that we want to transform into
an integer. As we already know, Lua only uses doubles, so we have to play with the encoding of doubles to obtain the binary representation that we are looking for</p>
<p>In this case, there is an easy reasoning to obtain this transformation. We are gonna assume that we <strong>only want to write values that fit the mantissa</strong> of a double, as
its not that useful to write incorrect data.</p>
<p>That means that <strong>we want an exponent full of zeroes</strong>. As we already know, that is an especial value in <em>floating-point numbers</em> that means that it is a <strong>denormalized number</strong>, that is, a <strong>very small number</strong>. <em>What is the smallest number we can have?</em> In the case of denormalized numbers, the value of a double is calculated as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>(-1)**sign * 2**(1-1023) * 0.mantissa = (-1)**sign * 2**-1022 * 0.mantissa
</code></pre><p>So it basically is <code>2**-1022 * smallest_mantissa_possible</code>. <em>What is the smallest mantissa possible?</em> As we have 52 bits of precision, that would be <code>2**-52</code>. So that means that the
smallest number representable is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>(-1)**sign * 2**-1022 * 2**-52 = (-1)**sign * 2**-1074
</code></pre><p>We can check this with the same Python code we used to convert from <code>double</code> to <code>integer</code></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Exponent: 00000000000
Mantissa: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
Number:   0x1
</code></pre><p>As expected, the exponent is zero, as it is a denormalized number, and only the last bit is set, so it is the <strong>smallest representable number</strong>.</p>
<p>All this means that <em>if we multiply our double with this value</em>, we will get <strong>a double representation that encodes our number in the same way as an integer</strong>.</p>

<p>Another generic primitive that will be useful in most cases is the ability to control the instruction pointer. To do this, we can either fake a <code>CClosure</code> or a <code>Light C Function</code>. In this case, we are going to use a <code>Light C Function</code>, because this also <strong>reveals a useful leak that we don’t know yet</strong>. The difference between both is that a <code>CCLosure</code> can have upvalues, while a <code>Light C Function</code> can not.</p>

</code></pre><p>This is interesting for <strong>two reasons</strong>, the obvious one is that controlling the instruction pointer allow us to further alter the behaviour of the program and opens the door to
ROP chains and such, but the other reason is that as the <strong>pointer of a Light C Function is stored inline we can leak it</strong> with our address leak primitive.</p>
<p>This is great because <strong>functions in Lua are implemented as light C functions</strong>, and that means that <strong>this is an straighforward way to bypass ASLR</strong>.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span>print(string.format(<span>&#34;Print at: 0x%x&#34;</span>, addr_of(print)))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This can be used to bypass ASLR and then <strong>calculate the address of a sandboxed function</strong> to then call it with another fake function to bypass the sandbox</p>

<p>With all these primitives, we now have multiple ways to get RCE in Factorio. We could, for example, make a ROP chain with a fake function to execute code in the target. However, that is not that interesting, we are going to follow a different path so we can play some more tricks and avoid having to write a chain.</p>
<p>The exploitation path is going to be the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find an <strong>imported function that we can call from Lua</strong> code where we <em>control the first parameter passed</em></li>
<li><strong>Replace the address of this function with the address of system</strong> in the <em>GOT</em></li>
<li>Call the function with the address of a string to execute commands in the system</li>
</ol>
<p>For those unfamiliar with Linux exploitation, the <em>Global Offset Table</em> (GOT) contains the <strong>address of globals</strong> so they can be located in <em>Position Independent Code</em>. One of the things stored in the GOT are the <strong>resolved addresses of shared libraries functions</strong>. When our code wants to call a function such as <code>printf</code>, it is going to use the address stored in GOT, if we can overwrite an entry, we can make it <strong>call a different function with the parameters of the original function</strong>.</p>
<p>This will prove useful as fake functions <strong>don’t give us the ability to pass parameters following the calling convention</strong> (that is, using registers such as <code>RDI</code>), so we could call <code>system</code> but without control of the parameters, which is not great.</p>
<p>If we <strong>find a shared library function that is callable from Lua where the first parameter is controlled by us</strong>, we could replace its address with the address of <code>system</code> to execute commands, as we would have control of the parameter expected by it.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c++"><span><span><span>int</span> <span>system</span>(<span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>*</span>command);

<p>Until now, all our testing was done on the <em>official Lua interpreter</em><sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>, as it was easier and faster to work with. By doing this, we trusted that the modified
implementation used in Factorio didn’t diverge too much from the official one. In this section, we will make the modifications needed
to run our primitives in Factorio.</p>
<p>In Factorio, <strong>Garbage Collected Objects</strong>, that is things like <code>TString</code>, <code>LClosure</code> or <code>Proto</code> have an extra pointer as part of the <code>CommonHeader</code>.</p>
<p>Factorio:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c++"><span><span><span>#define CommonHeader	GCObject *previous; GCObject *next; lu_byte tt; lu_byte marked

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>It seems that in Factorio objects are part of a <em>double linked list</em>, while they are usually part of a <em>single linked list</em>.</p>
<p>For our purposes, this means that some offsets are off by <code>8</code>. For example, the header of a <code>TString</code> is no longer <code>24</code> but <code>32</code>, which breaks our calculation to locate the content of a string and our read primitive.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span><span>function</span> <span>read</span>(fake_string, addr, size)
</span></span><span><span>  <span>-- First we calculate if the address is reachable from our position</span>

<h3 id="its-not-doubles-theres-no-way-its-doubles-it-was-doubles">It’s not Doubles, There’s no way it’s Doubles, It was Doubles</h3>
<p>Unfortunately for us, Factorio seems to be using a version of <em>sprintf</em> that uses a different encoding when the format string <code>%a</code> is used<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>. This is breaking our
conversion from a <em>fake double</em> to a real double.</p>
<p>For example, if we leak the value <code>2.1038461432219e-316</code> we would expect the following string after calling <code>string.format(&#34;%.13a&#34;, 2.1038461432219e-316)</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>0x0.000000289c130p-1022 -&gt; 0x289c130
</code></pre><p>However, we instead got:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>0xa.2704c00000000p-1052 -&gt; 0xfe32704c00000000
</code></pre><p>This completely breaks the code we made. Maybe depending on libraries <em>was not a great idea</em>.</p>
<p>Now that we have a better understanding of doubles, <strong>let’s write a completely numeric approach</strong>, like is done in other writeups <sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<p>As we know, <code>2^-1074</code> is the smallest number possible, as it is a denormalized number with only the last bit set</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Exponent: 00000000000
Mantissa: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
</code></pre><p>We used this to force a representation of an integer in a double, but we can actually do the <strong>opposite operation</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s see it with an example. Imagine we leak the pointer <code>0x289c130</code> using our leak primitive, if we try to print it, we get the value <code>2.1038461432219e-316</code>, <em>how can we get the original number?</em></p>
<p>The trick is in understanding that in denormalized form, the position of the bits in the mantissa matter, as bits to the right represent smaller numbers. This is why even if all pointers are integers, they don’t have the same exponent when considered a double, as the position of the rightmost bit changes</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Exponent 00000000000
Mantissa: 0000000000000000000000000010100010011100000100110000
</code></pre><p>This behaviour can make us think that the operation we need to do depends on the exponent provided by Lua, while in reality <strong>it does not matter at all</strong>. Think about it, no matter the integer,
the value always starts at the rightmost bit, so in reality, we can consider <strong>all integers to have exponent -1074</strong> when represented as a double, which is exactly what we did in the oppsite operation.</p>
<p>So all this means that by doing <code>leak * 2**1074</code> we can recover the original number</p>

<p>We have to split the multiplication in two parts as <code>2**1074</code> is not representable as a double (remember that the highest exponent is <code>1023</code>)
</p>

<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="lua"><span><span><span>function</span> <span>double_to_number</span>(double)
</span></span><span><span>  <span>return</span> double <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>^</span><span>52</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>^</span><span>1022</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>end</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can also see it in the following way: the first multiplication makes sure the number is no longer <em>denormalized</em>, as they are represented in the mantissa, which has <strong>52 bits</strong>, while the second multiplication makes the exponent positive, as the smallest negative exponent in a normal number is <code>-1022</code>. After doing this, the double now properly encodes the integer leaked</p>
<h2 id="1-function-to-replace-with-system">1. Function to replace with System</h2>
<p>Now that our primitives work in Factorio, let’s finally get to RCE. First, for our idea to work, we need an imported function that we can call from Lua for which we control the first parameter.</p>
<p>The Lua version in Factorio is pretty limited in terms of available libraries, but fortunately, the <code>math</code> library has a perfect example of this at <code>math_ldexp</code></p>

<p>Now that we found a function that is suitable to be replace with system, we need to overwrite it’s address with the address of system, but to do that, we first need to locate system in memory, as the target has <strong>ASLR enabled</strong>.</p>
<p>This shouldn’t be a problem, right? We have our read primitive. However, there is a <em>small problem</em>, the GOT table is located before the Heap, so our read primitive is unable to leak it, as we can only leak
data <strong>after our string header</strong>.</p>
<p>We could search in heap for pointers to libc but that is not as reliable, is there anything we can do to avoid this? Yes, there is.</p>
<p>As we also have a write-what-where primitive, why don’t we craft a <code>TString</code> before the GOT table? It should be possible, right?</p>
<p>There are two ways to do this, we could search in memory for some data that resembles a <code>TString</code> structure before the GOT that we can use as our fake <code>TString</code>, our we can write our own.</p>
<p>In this case, as there is a writable segment before the GOT, we can just use that</p>
