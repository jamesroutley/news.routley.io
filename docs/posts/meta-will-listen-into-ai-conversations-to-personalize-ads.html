    <h1>Meta will listen into AI conversations to personalize ads</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Meta, having committed hundreds of billions to AI infrastructure and talent, says it will start using people&#39;s conversations and interactions with its AI services to create personalized content and advertising.</p>
<p>This applies to <a href="https://www.meta.ai/">Meta AI</a>, the company&#39;s web-based chat interface, and apps that integrate Meta AI, such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.</p>
<p>Meta intends to begin using people&#39;s text exchanges and voice conversations with its AI service to generate personalized posts, reels, and other attention lures starting on December 16, 2025.</p>

    

<p>&#34;For example, if you chat with Meta AI about hiking, we may learn that you’re interested in hiking – just as we would if you posted a reel about hiking or liked a hiking-related Page,&#34; the company <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/10/improving-your-recommendations-apps-ai-meta/">explained</a> in its announcement. &#34;As a result, you might start seeing recommendations for hiking groups, posts from friends about trails, or ads for hiking boots.&#34;</p>

        


        

<p>A notification campaign about the change begins October 7, 2025.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no opt-out, but Meta has spared those who live in the EU, the UK, and South Korea for the time being.</p>

        

<p>The social networking giant and metaverse money-burner will let users make some adjustments to its <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/09/introducing-vibes-ai-videos/">slop</a>-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Force-feeding&amp;oldid=1311058453">gavage</a> loop with its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/109378269482053">Ads Preferences</a> and <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2022/10/new-ways-to-customize-your-facebook-feed/">feed customization</a> controls.</p>
<p>Meta insists it won&#39;t personalize ads based on conversations that touch on religion, sexual orientation, politics, health, race, ethnicity, philosophical belief, or trade union membership.</p>
<p>That list of untouchable topics suggests canny Meta users could stymie the personalization plan by prefixing every interaction with a suitably sensitive term – for example, start every interaction with &#34;Pray tell...&#34; or “Oh, Lord, Meta really thought this was a good idea?”</p>

</ul>
<p>Known as Facebook until brand damage from incessant privacy scandals inspired <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">a name change in 2021</a>, Meta was notionally focused on the metaverse – an ill-defined term for immersive digital experiences that may or may not involve goggles. Having spent something like <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/01/metas_metaverse_mention/">$60 billion on its Reality Labs group</a> without much to show for it (apart from the privacy-invading Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses), Meta lately has taken to talking up AI.</p>
<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month told President Trump that Meta plans to invest $600 billion on AI investment through 2028 – and surely that will happen because Zuckerberg <a href="https://www.threads.com/@zuck/post/DORJoYgkXUH?xmt=AQF0CNIpSRsk_HIXDmfYchDE46PSmeeKhR344m0c25Bl-A">said it</a>, even if other massive AI spending projects like Stargate’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/softbank-openai-a3dc57b4">promised $500 billion AI infrastructure investments</a> don’t quite add up.</p>

        

<p>Meta&#39;s interest in AI, however, is really about ads – using AI to encourage exposure to and engagement with ads, some of which may be generated by AI. The company has already <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/01/meta_ai_investments/">said</a> AI has helped boost engagement with ads posted to its platforms. Execs also see AI as making it easier to advertisers to create and manage campaigns.</p>
<p>As noted by the UK&#39;s Open Rights Group, 98 percent of Meta’s <a href="https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/">$165 billion of revenue in 2024</a> came from advertising, resulting in net income of $62.4 billion.</p>
<p>Iesha White, director of intelligence for marketing watchdog Check My Ads, told <em>The Register</em> in an email that several AI companies like Perplexity and OpenAI have integrated advertising into their AI products.</p>
<p>&#34;But this is different – Meta’s core business is monetizing ad space across its owned and operated sites and apps, in addition to ad placements on external publisher partnerships via its Facebook Audience Network product,&#34; said White. &#34;By harvesting data from its AI chats across WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook, Meta gains yet another closed-loop data source, meaning Meta could reduce transparency of the targeting inputs across its advertising products, in the name of privacy.</p>
<p>&#34;It also provides an opportunity for Meta to further shape and obfuscate its attribution models using its own source of truth, with brands unable to independently audit a campaign’s true effectiveness.&#34;</p>
<p>Meta coincidentally is fighting a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://searchengineland.com/supreme-court-meta-ad-fraud-case-proceed-450504">$7 billion class action</a> <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2024/03/21/22-15916.pdf">lawsuit</a> [PDF] brought by advertisers who claim that Meta fraudulently represented the potential reach of its ads by citing user accounts rather than actual people – a charge Meta disputes. ®</p>
