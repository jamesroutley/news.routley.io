    <h1>Let&amp;#8217;s Build Lenses in Carp</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Today I want to try something a little bit different: I want to share a screencast with you! I’ve never done this, but I’ve always had a passion for live coding during my talks<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, and I don’t feel like writing much at the moment.</p>
<p>The intended audience either knows a little bit about Carp or about lenses already. This talk assumes no prior knowledge, but it’s hard to learn multiple concepts at once. Of course you are welcome to watch it anyway, and I’d be happy to answer any and all questions you might have.</p>
<p>The video file is rather large, and I apologize for that. If you have any favorite screen recording tools on OS X, please tell me!</p>

It is not great if you don’t want to read 50 pages about that topic.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.jle.im/entry/lenses-products-prisms-sums.html">Lenses embody Products, Prisms embody Sums</a> by <strong>Justin Le</strong>: this blog post is a very detailed and deep dive into lenses and prisms, using Haskell as the vehicle. It explains why our implementation is theoretically unsound and how to rectify that. It is also more advanced than my screencast.</li>
