    <h1>Pollen: A publishing system written in Racket</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Pollen is a publishing system that helps authors make functional and beautiful digital books.</p><p>I created Pollen so I could make my web-based books <a href="http://practicaltypography.com"><span>Practical Typography</span></a>, <a href="http://typographyforlawyers.com"><span>Typography for Lawyers</span></a>, and <a href="http://beautifulracket.com"><span>Beautiful Racket</span></a>. Sure, go take a look. Are they better than the last digital books you encountered? Yes they are. Would you like your next digital book to work like that? If so, keep reading.</p><p>That’s what Pollen is for.</p><p>Not that you need to be a programmer to start using Pollen. On the contrary, the Pollen language is markup-based, so you can write &amp; edit text naturally. But when you want to automate repetitive tasks, add cross-references, or pull in data from other sources, you can access a full programming language from within the text.</p><p>That language is <a href="http://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>. I chose Racket because it has some unique features that made Pollen possible. So if it’s unfamiliar to you, don’t panic. It was unfamiliar to me. Once you see what you can do with Racket &amp; Pollen, you may be persuaded. I was.</p><p>Or, if you can find a better digital-publishing tool, use that. But I’m never going back to the way I used to work.</p></div>
