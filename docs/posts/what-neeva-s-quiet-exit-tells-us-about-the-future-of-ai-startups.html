Beginning in June I will be moving one issue per week behind a paywall, in addition to all posts that are more than two weeks old. You can read more about it below.</em></p><p>Snowflake, synonymous with the data warehouse, has been trying to crack into machine learning and data science for a few years through a variety of strategies like supporting Python and acquiring machine learning platform Streamlit for an eye-popping $800 million.</p><p><span>This week it </span><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/snowflake-acquires-neeva-to-accelerate-search-in-the-data-cloud-through-generative-ai/" rel="">acquired another well-known generative AI startup</a><span>, Neeva, founded by the former Google advertising lead Sridhar Ramaswamy. But Snowflake is not buying an AI-powered search engine with Neeva.</span></p><p>Neeva’s acquisition—or acquihire, as most people consider it—feels like the current nature of the AI industry summed up: technology in service to an ambiguous end-user (consumer vs. enterprise), star power draw, immense opportunity, and enormous vulnerability to the largest incumbents.</p><p><span>The startup, from what I’ve heard, was acquired for around $150 million—though there’s always some nuance when it comes to retention bonuses and such in acquisitions like this. And most I talk to consider getting Ramaswamy in the door as one of the dominant driving factors of the deal. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/martyswant/2021/03/08/after-building-googles-advertising-business-this-founder-is-creating-an-ad-free-alternative/?sh=f34b37df6ac8" rel="">Forbes reported Neeva’s valuation was $300 million in a funding round in March 2021</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Neeva tried to make a paid version of a search engine that would avoid getting stuffed full of ads like Google did and offer better privacy. In the process, Neeva </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/martyswant/2021/03/08/after-building-googles-advertising-business-this-founder-is-creating-an-ad-free-alternative/" rel="">raised around $77.5 million from investors including Greylock and Sequoia</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Neeva launched </span><a href="https://neeva.com/blog/introducing-neevaai" rel="">NeevaAI in January this year</a><span> to compete with a future that was going to be more dominated with AI-generated search results in Google and Bing. That didn’t pan out, and earlier this week Ramaswamy said the company would be focusing on enterprise LLMs.</span></p><p>“Many of the techniques we have pioneered with small models, size reduction, latency reduction, and inexpensive deployment are the elements that enterprises really want, and need, today,” he wrote in a blog post announcing the shutdown of the consumer product. </p><p><span>His announcement shutting down the product came around the same time The Information </span><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/snowflake-nears-acquisition-of-search-startup-neeva" rel="">reported that Snowflake was in advanced talks to acquire it</a><span>. Neeva was also in conversations with other potential buyers at the time, according to several sources I spoke with.</span></p><p><span>In his note shutting down Neeva’s search product, essentially </span><a href="https://neeva.com/blog/may-announcement" rel="">pointed to the cognitive switching costs of moving to a different search engine</a><span> as a primary culprit for its failure to gain traction. Regardless of whether Google or Bing’s generative AI search experience would be a hit with users (which is an </span><em>enormous</em><span> TBD) didn’t really matter given the size of the market they’d already accumulated.</span></p><p>“Convincing users to pay for a better experience was actually a less difficult problem compared to getting them to try a new search engine in the first place,” he wrote.</p><p>In the end, we have an enterprise data warehousing company, which is trying to build a machine learning development platform, acquiring an AI-powered consumer search engine that shut down due to the the sustained inertia built up by incumbents. The tools Neeva built for consumers were uniquely suited for enterprise needs, and Neeva couldn’t beat Google and Microsoft with a better product experience.</p><p><span>It’s the type of story we’re going to see </span><em>a lot</em><span> more going forward as the industry continues to develop.</span></p><p>Snowflake, meanwhile, sits in a unique position in that it’s already claimed an enormous part of the data stack for modern companies (particularly startups), and all that data will inevitably be used for training and fine-tuning models at some point. Bringing in a team like Neeva’s gives it some on-the-ground experience building and deploying models to figure out how that workflow will work.</p><p>Where the Neeva team fits into Snowflake from an organizational standpoint remains an open question. From what I’ve heard, Streamlit founder Adrien Treuille has taken on more leadership in Snowflake’s machine learning organization beyond just Streamlit. It’s also unclear what tools it’s carrying over and integrating from Neeva.</p><p><span>But it’s also netting a very well-known and well-respected figure in the industry that can serve as a steward as it continues to move into machine learning products. Particularly as Snowflake faces an uphill battle convincing a now critical community that Databricks has already served for years. Databricks, too, </span><a href="https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm" rel="">has tapped the OSS zeitgeist with its own large language model</a><span>, </span><a href="https://huggingface.co/databricks/dolly-v2-12b" rel="">Dolly 2.0</a><span>.</span></p><p>The kind of crossover experience you see from the 50-person Neeva team is going to continue to gain value as time goes on. And non-intuitive enterprise companies—particularly platform plays like Snowflake playing in a highly competitive market—will probably end up being landing places for a lot of the “consumer” AI startups that fail to gain substantial traction.</p><p>Everyone is building on top of the same technology, and the skill sets of building and running an AI platform will soon grow well beyond standard machine learning engineering. The question is which of these teams will be able to build lasting products, and which will end up with soft landings at companies scrambling to build out AI-focused teams.</p><p data-attrs="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.supervised.news/p/what-neevas-quiet-exit-tells-us-about?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Share&#34;,&#34;action&#34;:null,&#34;class&#34;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a href="https://www.supervised.news/p/what-neevas-quiet-exit-tells-us-about?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share" rel=""><span>Share</span></a></p><p>Now on to Nvidia, a company that some seem to have discovered makes AI hardware as of this week.</p><p><span>Nvidia’s earnings report Wednesday came out about as glowing as they could have hoped for following announcements from Meta and Google that they were building superclusters based off Nvidia’s hardware.

And it’s likely many more mainstream LPs interested in another trillion-dollar slot in the S&amp;P 500 are eyeing the same opportunity.</span></p><p>How that materializes given the historical track record of machine training chip startups is still to be determined, especially since even AMD hasn’t made a true dent in Nvidia. </p><p><span>But I </span><em>do</em><span>, however, know of a very large number of standing open offers among tech executives that are more than ready to try out a different kind of hardware than what Nvidia offers if a truly competitive one ever actually materializes.</span></p><p><strong><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5814b408-8111-49a9-8885-8a8434022352" rel="">OpenAI warns over split with Europe as regulation advances (Financial Times)</a></strong><span>: Sam Altman comes in to once again say he hopes to comply with regulations, but if OpenAI can’t, it will pull out of Europe.
