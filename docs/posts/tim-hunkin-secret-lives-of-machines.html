    </SPAN><p><SPAN size="4"></SPAN><SPAN size="3" face="Arial">I felt a bit embarrassed putting this
    site together as it seemed a bit like vanity publishing. At times it was also an odd
    feeling, &#39;editing&#39; my past. But then, I had all the images and it seemed a waste to let
    them rot, and I wanted to try doing a website. Practically, it will also be useful for anyone
    interested in commissioning work to look at my past stuff. </SPAN><SPAN size="3"><SPAN face="Arial">I
    appologise that the layout of everything on the site is a bit chaotic - frontpage is such
    an irritating piece of software.</SPAN></SPAN></p><SPAN size="3">
    </SPAN><p><SPAN size="3"><SPAN face="Arial">Now I look at the site Iâ€™m amazed just how much
    stuff I have made, but then 51 years is a long time to be alive. The stuff is also
    satisfyingly varied. For many years, while I was doing my part time job drawing the
    Rudiments of Wisdom cartoon, I felt a missionary zeal to find what I really wanted to do
    with my life. Gradually I found there was no single ideal occupation - I thrive on variety
    and get most satisfaction from exploring things I haven&#39;t tried before.</SPAN></SPAN></p></div>
