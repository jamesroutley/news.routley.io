    <h1>How to reset your Chrome QuotaManager database</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-161">
        
        <div><p><em>In the recent update to Chrome 99 a number of users have encountered a bug where the in-browser database stops working. We received reports of this from <a href="https://gofullpage.com/">GoFullPage</a> users. Here are some steps to mitigate the issue.</em></p>
<p>The Chrome team has been helpful in tracking this issue and the following notes are mostly copied from Simeon’s <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1303434#c28">response on this bug</a>—thanks, Simeon et al.!</p>
<p>You can check for the problem by opening up the JavaScript console (right-click window &gt; inspect &gt; console) and seeing if there’s one of the following errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>InvalidStateError: An operation that depends on state cached in an interface object was made but the state had changed since it was read from disk.</li>
<li>DOMException: Internal error retrieving bucket data directory</li>
<li>UnknownError: Internal error opening backing store for indexedDB.open</li>
</ul>
<p>See the workarounds below. If you’re up for it (especially if you know your way around a terminal), then I recommend doing <a href="#workaround3">option 3</a>, but the quickest way to get something going in a time crunch is <a href="#workaround1">option 1</a>.</p>


<h3>Workaround 1: Create a new profile</h3>
<p>The issue is profile-specific. So if you create a new one or switch to another you can likely get around this issue. It’s the quickest way to get around this issue.</p>
<p>See instructions to add or switch a profile on <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?#7110673">support.google.com</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>On your computer, open Chrome.</li>
<li>At the top right, click the circular Profile image.</li>
<li>Click Add or select another one. </li>
<li>Try the extension here (install it first if necessary since extensions are installed per-profile)</li>
</ol>


<h3>Workaround 2: Reset your current profile</h3>
<p>This allows you to continue using Chrome as you normally do, but many features will go back to default settings. See <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/3296214">these instructions on resetting your profile</a> for info on what gets reset and what remains.</p>
<ol>
<li>On your computer, open Chrome.</li>
<li>At the top right, click the 3 dots for “More” and then Settings and then Advanced.</li>
<li>Follow the appropriate instructions for your operating system<ul>
<li>On Chromebook, Linux, and Mac: Click Reset settings and then Restore settings to their original defaults and then Reset settings.</li>
<li>On Windows: Click Reset and cleanup and then Reset settings to their original defaults and then Reset settings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Workaround 3: Manually delete your QuotaManager database</h3>
<p>This approach will surgically address the underlying database corruption without affecting your profile settings. The QuotaManager database will be rebuilt next time Chrome starts.</p>
<p>Before proceeding, copying these instructions to a text file as you will have to close Chrome.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter the URL <code>chrome://version</code> in the URL bar of Chrome</li>
<li>Search for the key &#34;Profile Path&#34; and copy the value, which should look something like the following (note: each profile has a unique path):<ul>
<li>Windows:</li>
<li>Mac:</li>
<li>Linux:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Navigate to this path in your operating system&#39;s file browser (likely easier from the terminal if possible)</li>
<li>Completely exit Chrome.  </li>
<li>Delete the &#34;QuotaManager&#34; and &#34;QuotaManager-journal&#34; entries inside this directory. Using the Mac example from above it would look like this:</li>
</ol>
<div><pre><span></span><code>rm <span>&#34;/Users/MyUserName/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/QuotaManager&#34;</span>
rm <span>&#34;/Users/MyUserName/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/QuotaManager-journal&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>6. Reopen Chrome.</p>
<p>If you’re encountering this issue and tried one of the workarounds, let me know below. If you want to contact support for the extension, then just follow the prompts in the extension and someone will help you out!</p></div>
