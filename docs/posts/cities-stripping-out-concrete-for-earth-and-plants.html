In Leuven, Belgium, in 2023 alone, Baptist Vlaeminck, who leads Leuven&#39;s Life Pact climate adaptation project, calculates that the removal of 6,800 sq metres (73,000 sq ft) of hard surfacing allowed for the infiltration of an additional 377,000 gallons (1.7 million litres) of water into the ground.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;With climate change, extreme weather rainfall events are going to increase and so [depaving is] not a nice-to-have – it&#39;s a necessity,&#34; Casimirri adds.<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="text-block"><p>The question is whether the authorities responsible for cities, and planning, realise this. In most parts of the world, depaving can still be described as a fringe activity. &#34;We&#39;re going to need a scale of investment that has a lot more zeroes on it,&#34; says Thami Croeser at RMIT University, Melbourne&#39;s Centre for Urban Research.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Community-led and DIY efforts on driveways and on local streets with permission are fantastic, he adds, but it&#39;s even better to think of depaving and greening as the introduction of a new kind of infrastructure in a city.

Vlaeminck says that, to support people with impaired vision or mobility issues, unused areas of road or pavement are prioritised for depaving and sufficient space – more than a metre – is safeguarded on pavements to allow people plenty of room. Existing paving left in place is also renewed or repaired to ensure there are no bumps or unevenness. In situations where pavements are removed completely, for shared use of a roadway in low traffic neighbourhoods, Vlaeminck says depaving teams introduce measures to reduce the speed of cars.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Both Depave in Portland and Green Ventury in Ontario say they work with communities to ensure accessibility requirements are met. Casimirri refers to a recent project that replaced broken, uneven concrete with shrubbery and level walkways between.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>Among the initiatives instigated by Leuven is a &#34;tile taxi&#34; – a small truck that officials will happily send to your home so you can throw in concrete tiles or cobblestones you have removed from your garden. The material is later reused rather than thrown away, says Vlaeminck, who adds that several million euros have been set aside by Leuven to fund depaving and renaturing projects such as this.<!-- --></p></section><section data-component="text-block"><p>And there&#39;s more. Since January 2024, developers in Leuven have had to demonstrate that any rain that falls on new or significantly renovated homes can either be capture and re-used on-site or filtrate into the property&#39;s garden rather than pool up and cause a flood. If developers can&#39;t prove their designs are extreme rainfall-ready, they won&#39;t be approved, says Vlaeminck.<!-- --></p></section><!--$!--><!--/$--><section data-component="text-block"><p>France, too, is making depaving official, says Gwendoline Grandin, an ecologist with the Île-de-France Regional Agency for Biodiversity.
