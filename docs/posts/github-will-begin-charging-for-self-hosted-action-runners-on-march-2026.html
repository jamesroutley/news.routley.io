    <h1>GitHub will begin charging for self-hosted action runners on March 2026</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>On <strong>January 1, 2026</strong>, GitHub will <strong>reduce the price of GitHub-hosted runners by up to 39%</strong> <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing">depending on the machine type used</a>. The free usage minute quotas will remain the same.</p>
<p>On <strong>March 1, 2026,</strong> GitHub will introduce a new <strong>$0.002 per minute GitHub Actions cloud platform charge</strong> that will apply to self-hosted runner usage. Any usage subject to this charge will count toward the minutes included in your plan, as explained in <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions#free-use-of-github-actions">our GitHub Actions billing documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Runner usage in public repositories will <strong>remain free.</strong> There will be no changes in price structure for GitHub Enterprise Server customers.</p>

<p>We are increasing our investment into our self-hosted experience to ensure that we can provide autoscaling for scenarios beyond just Linux containers. This will include new approaches to scaling, new platform support, Windows support, and more as we move through the next 12 months.</p>

<h3 id="faq" id="faq"><a href="#faq">FAQ<span aria-hidden="true"></span></a></h3>
<p><strong>Why am I being charged to use my own hardware?</strong></p>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://github.com/pricing/calculator#actions">Actions pricing calculator</a> to estimate your future costs.</p>
<p><strong>What are the new GitHub-hosted runner rates?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why is .002/minute the right price for self-hosted runners on cloud?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Which job execution scenarios for GitHub Actions are affected by this pricing change?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jobs that run in private repositories and use standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners  </li>
<li>Any jobs running on larger GitHub-hosted runners</li>
</ul>
<p>Standard GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runner usage on public repositories will remain free. GitHub Enterprise Server pricing is not impacted by this change.</p>
<p><strong>When will this pricing change take effect?</strong></p>
<p>The price decrease for GitHub-hosted runners will take effect on January 1, 2026. The new charge for self-hosted runners will apply beginning on March 1, 2026. The price changes will impact all customers on these dates.</p>
<p><strong>Will the free usage quota available in my plan change?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Will self-hosted runner usage consume from my free usage minutes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How does this pricing change affect customers on GitHub Enterprise Server?</strong></p>
<p>This pricing change does not affect customers using GitHub Enterprise Server. Customers running Actions jobs on self-hosted runners on GitHub Enterprise Server may continue to host, manage, troubleshoot and use Actions on and in conjunction with their implementation free of charge.</p>
<p><strong>Can I bill my self-hosted runner usage on private repositories through Azure?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, as long as you have an active Azure subscription ID associated with your GitHub Enterprise or Organization(s).</p>
<p><strong>What is the overall impact of this change to GitHub customers?</strong></p>
<p>96% of customers will see no change to their bill. Of the 4% of Actions users impacted by this change, 85% of this cohort will see their Actions bill decrease and the remaining 15% who are impacted across all face a median increase around $13.</p>
<p><strong>Did GitHub consider how this impacts individual developers, not just Enterprise scale customers of GitHub?</strong></p>
<p><strong>How can I figure out what my new monthly cost for Actions looks like?</strong></p>
<p>GitHub Actions provides <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/how-tos/products/view-productlicense-use">detailed usage reports for the current and prior year</a>. You can use this prior usage alongside the <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing">rate changes</a> that will be introduced in January and March to estimate cost under the new pricing structure. We have created a <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/tutorials/estimate-actions-costs">Python script</a> to help you leverage <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/how-tos/products/view-productlicense-use#downloading-usage-reports">full usage reports</a> to calculate your expected cost after the price updates.</p>
<p>We have also updated our <a href="https://github.com/pricing/calculator#actions">Actions pricing calculator</a>, making it easier to estimate your future costs, particularly if your historical usage is limited or not representative of expected future usage.</p>
