    <h1>GitHub will begin charging for self-hosted action runners on March 2026</h1>

<p>On <strong>January 1, 2026</strong>, GitHub will <strong>reduce the price of GitHub-hosted runners by up to 39%</strong> <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/reference/actions-runner-pricing">depending on the machine type used</a>. The free usage minute quotas will remain the same.</p>
<p>On <strong>March 1, 2026,</strong> GitHub will introduce a new <strong>$0.002 per minute GitHub Actions cloud platform charge</strong> that will apply to self-hosted runner usage. Any usage subject to this charge will count toward the minutes included in your plan, as explained in <a href="https://docs.github.com/billing/concepts/product-billing/github-actions#free-use-of-github-actions">our GitHub Actions billing documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Runner usage in public repositories will <strong>remain free.</strong> There will be no changes in price structure for GitHub Enterprise Server customers.</p>

<p>We are increasing our investment into our self-hosted experience to ensure that we can provide autoscaling for scenarios beyond just Linux containers. This will include new approaches to scaling, new platform support, Windows support, and more as we move through the next 12 months.</p>
