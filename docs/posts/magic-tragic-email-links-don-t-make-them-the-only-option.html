    <h1>Magic/tragic email links: don&#39;t make them the only option</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The term “Magic Links” once meant a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Link">futuristic PDA</a>. Nowdays, companies like <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/passwordless/authentication-methods/email-magic-link">Auth0</a> use it to refer to the slightly-magical feat of including a login link in an email.</p><p>Last week, the great website you should subscribe to if you haven’t already (it’s great, when you’re not logged out), <a href="https://www.404media.co/">404 Media</a>, posted <a href="https://www.404media.co/we-dont-want-your-password-3/">“We Don’t Want Your Password”</a> in defense of so-called magic links.</p><p>Of course, as stated in the article, such email links are harder to phish than passwords, can’t lead to a breach of passwords, and protect the site itself against users who might reuse passwords previously compromised.</p><p>The article even covers some of my annoyances with this system, but throws out this sentence:</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://www.404media.co/we-dont-want-your-password-3/">We find this to be a much easier login process and wish it was more common across the web where appropriate.</a></p></blockquote><p>Easier than what? Easier than a long password, without a password manager? Easier than a passkey? Easier than an OTP sent to the same email address?</p><p>This sentence reads to me as one written by someone mostly working and <em>living</em> from a single laptop and mobile device. The second part of the sentence, calling for more sites to do this is why I am writing this.</p><p>For any scenario with a minimal amount of complexity, like users with multiple computers, and you’re looking at a scenario where the site’s unwillingness to deal with other login methods shoves friction on the end-user.</p><h3 id="what-makes-them-tragic">What makes them tragic:<a href="#what-makes-them-tragic" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><ol><li>Multiple devices. Who doesn’t use at least a few computers weekly? I don’t have my email on my gaming PC, nor do I have it on my work laptops.</li><li>Slower. From 2 seconds slower to minutes slower, depending on SMTP delays as well as how awkward it is to get the link to the right browser.</li><li>Anti-mobile. As mentioned by 404 in their own article, this breaks the ability to use in-app browsers, which is quite annoying especially for RSS reader type apps. It makes interacting with any local link in the RSS feed extremely annoying.</li><li>Indirect security downsides. Pushing people to access personal email on work devices (or vice-versa) isn’t exactly a win for security.</li></ol><p>Another annoying <em>passwordless</em> system is to email or SMS an OTP the end user can type in.</p><p>While this sucks, it at least allows you to easily log in in situations where you don’t have a clear and easy copy/paste path from the email client to the browser you want to log in to.</p><p><a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a>, powered by <a href="https://passport.online">Passport</a>, uses this type of scheme (click link OR type in OTP), which is still shifting annoyances onto end-users to free developers from implementing passkeys, but at least has a bit more of an appreciation for end-users.</p><p>If you insist on using magic/tragic links by default, at least consider offering a robust alternative, such as <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">passkeys</a>, especially if your audience is technical and privacy-focused.</p><p><em>Update: This great post by Ricky Mondello was pointed out to me and explains how passkeys can make this better. I highly recommend reading it.</em> <a href="https://rmondello.com/2025/01/02/magic-links-and-passkeys/">Magic Links Have Rough Edges, but Passkeys Can Smooth Them Over</a></p></div></div></div>
