    <h1>New Microsoft Exchange zero-days allow RCE, data theft attacks</h1>

<p>Microsoft Exchange is impacted by four zero-day vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit remotely to execute arbitrary code or disclose sensitive information on affected installations.</p>
<p>The zero-day vulnerabilities were disclosed by Trend Micro&#39;s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) yesterday, who reported them to Microsoft on September 7th and 8th, 2023.</p>
<p>Despite Microsoft acknowledging the reports, its security engineers decided the flaws weren&#39;t severe enough to guarantee immediate servicing, postponing the fixes for later.</p>
<p>ZDI disagreed with this response and decided to publish the flaws under its own tracking IDs to warn Exchange admins about the security risks.</p>
<p>A summary of the flaws can be found below:</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-1578/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>ZDI-23-1578</strong></a> – A remote code execution (RCE) flaw in the &#39;ChainedSerializationBinder&#39; class, where user data isn&#39;t adequately validated, allowing attackers to deserialize untrusted data. Successful exploitation enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code as &#39;SYSTEM,&#39; the highest level of privileges on Windows.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-1579/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>ZDI-23-1579</strong></a> – Located in the &#39;DownloadDataFromUri&#39; method, this flaw is due to insufficient validation of a URI before resource access. Attackers can exploit it to access sensitive information from Exchange servers.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-1580/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>ZDI-23-1580</strong></a> – This vulnerability, in the &#39;DownloadDataFromOfficeMarketPlace&#39; method, also stems from improper URI validation, potentially leading to unauthorized information disclosure.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-23-1581/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>ZDI-23-1581</strong></a> – Present in the CreateAttachmentFromUri method, this flaw resembles the previous bugs with inadequate URI validation, again, risking sensitive data exposure.</li>
</ul><p>All these vulnerabilities require authentication for exploitation, which reduces their severity CVSS rating to between 7.1 and 7.5. Furthermore, requiring authentication is a mitigation factor and possibly why Microsoft did not prioritize the fixing of the bugs.</p>
<p>It should be noted, though, that cybercriminals have many ways to obtain Exchange credentials, including brute-forcing weak passwords, performing phishing attacks, purchasing them, or acquiring them from info-stealer logs.</p>
<p>That said, the above zero-days shouldn&#39;t be treated as unimportant, especially ZDI-23-1578 (RCE), which can result in complete system compromise.</p>
<p>ZDI suggests that the only salient mitigation strategy is to restrict interaction with Exchange apps. However, this can be unacceptably disruptive for many businesses and organizations using the product.</p>
<p>We also suggest implementing multi-factor authentication to prevent cybercriminals from accessing Exchange instances even when account credentials have been compromised.</p>
<hr/><p><em>Update 11/4</em> - A Microsoft spokesperson responded to BleepingComputer&#39;s request for a comment with the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We appreciate the work of this finder submitting these issues under coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and we’re committed to taking the necessary steps to help protect customers.</p>
<p>We’ve reviewed these reports and have found that they have either already been addressed, or do not meet the bar for immediate servicing under our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/olsbugbar" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">severity classification guidelines</a> and we will evaluate addressing them in future product versions and updates as appropriate. - a Microsoft spokesperson </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further Microsoft provided the below additional context on each of the discovered flaws:  </p>
<ul><li>Regarding ZDI-23-1578: Customers who have applied the August Security Updates are already protected.</li>
<li>Regarding ZDI-23-1581: The technique described requires an attacker to have prior access to email credentials, and no evidence was presented that it can be leveraged to gain elevation of privilege.</li>
<li>Regarding ZDI-23-1579: The technique described requires an attacker to have prior access to email credentials.</li>
<li>Regarding ZDI-23-1580: The technique described requires an attacker to have prior access to email credentials, and no evidence was presented that it can be leveraged to access sensitive customer information.</li>
</ul>
