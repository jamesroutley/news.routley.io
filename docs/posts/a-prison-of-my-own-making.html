  <p>2025-06-30 - <strong>Killing the joy of homelabbing with my own expectation</strong></p>
  <p><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://social.jsteuernagel.de/@jana/114768460919053583">Yesterday I realized something</a>:
<strong>I&#39;ve built myself into a prison and didn&#39;t realize it.</strong></p>
<p>Let me explain:</p>
<p>Working on tech projects has always been something relaxing for me.
If I was stressed about something, I could always turn to my homelab as a source of calm and it would usually provide exactly the balance that I needed to keep going.</p>
<p>But recently I found this not to be the case anymore.
I would turn to a project and just stare at the screen.
I was thinking of all of the things I would need to do to set something new up and I felt overwhelmed.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed by all of the things that I convinced myself to be necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Everything needs to be declarative</strong></li>
<li><strong>Machines as cattle, not pets</strong></li>
<li><strong>Immutable systems and containers</strong></li>
<li><strong>GitOps all the things</strong></li>
<li><strong>Automated deployment</strong></li>
<li><strong>CI/CD pipeline</strong></li>
<li><strong>Security considerations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This lead me to my current setup, where it feels impossible to just do something.</p>
<p>Want to try out a new program?
Better first figure out how to run it in a container and make it run on Kubernetes.
And manifests need to be committed to Git.</p>
<p>Quickly spinning up a simple file share to give a friend a download link?
Impossible.
I don&#39;t have a single machine where I could just touch an nginx config and point it at a folder.</p>
<p>Install something on the home server?
Change the Nix config.
Oh, I didn&#39;t update it in a while, let&#39;s also do that.
Aaaand the rebuild is broken or there is yet another bug in nixpkgs that only shows itself after a few days.</p>
<p>Now today I realized that this goes even further:
I use Fedora Silverblue on my laptop.
That&#39;s an immutable distro and what has it caused?
I can&#39;t just install a program anymore.
I need to figure out whether it is available as a Flatpak, run it in distrobox (which I hate) or layer it and reboot.</p>
<p>None of these things are inherently bad.
All of these practices have their place.
Many make working on something with multiple people way easier.
But I am just myself and just documenting what I did in markdown files works <em>incredibly</em> well for me.</p>
<p>Spelling it out now, it feels like I should have realized way earlier what was killing my joy.
But now I did, so I&#39;ll be undoing a lot of this mess.</p>
<p>So here are a rough set of rules I have decided on for myself, so I hopefully don&#39;t fall into the same trap again:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay away from immutable distros</li>
<li>Only use deployment tools if they make things easier (Like setting up multiple machines at once)
<ul>
<li>And only use them for the parts that they actually make easier. I don&#39;t need purity here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ditch CI/CD pipelines (I want to go back to the simplicity of a shell script in a cronjob)</li>
<li>Stuff gets installed in the easiest way possible, preferable a container on a single host with Containerfiles neatly organized in a directory, otherwise throw it into a VM</li>
<li>Not everything needs to be fully declarative. Just doing a backup of state is fine!</li>
<li>Purity is a sin. Accept compromise if it makes something work better for me.</li>
</ul>
