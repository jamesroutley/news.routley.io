<h2>Not so early beginnings</h2>
It all began in the fall of 1992, in my final year of university.  For lack of 
a better arts elective to take, I decided to take Music 111.  I had absolutely
no background in music at the time, and sometimes even had trouble telling 
whether two consecutive notes were ascending or descending.  Nevertheless, I 
bravely decided to take the course.<p>
As the course progressed, I discovered that some of this stuff was actually
logical, and also kind of fun.  I found myself using the piano room just to
play around.  I never cared much for attempting to play sheet music,
but the idea of hitting keys and getting a sound that was sometimes harmonious
was strangely appealing.</p><p>
With my nonexistent music abilities, and my limited budget, I couldn&#39;t justify
buying myself a little Casio synthesizer or something like that.  The only way
I could justify owning a musical instrument was if I actually <i>built</i> it.</p><p>
I am very fortunate that my dad has a very large and wonderful 
<a href="http://woodgears.ca/dads_shop/index.html">woodworking shop</a>.
When I went home for Christmas that year, I started experimenting with
organ pipes.  That Christmas was particularly busy for me, as I also built two
tables, because the house I was renting with friends was a little bit 
under-furnished.</p><hr/>
<h2>Experiments and design</h2>
<p>
My first organ experiments were high in volume, if not in harmony.  I proceeded
to build two wooden pipes, and mounted these on top of a box with a vacuum
cleaner motor inside
</p><p>
<img alt="First pipe experiment" width="318" height="557" src="https://antiantihuman.com/first_pipes.jpg"/>
<b>My first organ pipe experiment</b>
</p><p>
From these experiments, a few things became apparent:</p><p>
Everybody in my family teased me about even considering building an organ, and
to tell the truth, I wasn&#39;t so sure at that point either.  I did experiment
with slowing down the vacuum cleaner motor (the black cylindrical thing to the
left of the box is a 1 kilowatt Variac), which helped, but I left it for the time
being.
</p><p>
I proceeded to build the two tables I had intended to build over the holidays, 
and then to experiment further.  I knew I could build pipes to play just about 
any reasonable pitch I wanted to, as long as I did not apply too much air pressure.
<br clear="left"/></p><p>
My next set of experiments revolved around coming up with a simple &#39;valve box&#39;
design that I could build.  At the time, I didn&#39;t know such a thing in organ
terminology is called a &#39;wind chest&#39;.  Another catch was that I did not have 
a good supply of leather for the &#39;gaskets&#39; in the valves, so the design I came
up with did not use any gaskets.
</p><p>

The letter labeled components are as follows:</p><p>

<tr><th>B</th><td>Black key</td></tr>
<tr><th>C</th><td>Felt for white key bottom stop</td></tr>
<tr><th>D</th><td>Felt for black key bottom stop</td></tr>
<tr><th>E</th><td>Metal bracket to support shaft every 12 keys</td></tr>
<tr><th>F</th><td>1/4&#34; steel shaft for key &#39;hinge&#39;</td></tr>
<tr><th>G</th><td>Top stop for keys (only gets hit if are let &#39;snap&#39; up&#39;</td></tr>

<tr><th>N</th><td>Valve block.  Valve block seals against wind chest bottom</td></tr>
<tr><th>O</th><td>Wind chest bottom</td></tr>
<tr><th>P</th><td>Plastic hoses leading to pipes</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
The valve blocks are all sanded smooth, and so is the bottom of the wind chest.
The leaf springs apply pressure exactly over the center of the hole below, thus
causing for a tight seal of the two flat surfaces.  The valve blocks are rounded
slightly towards the back.  This gives for a more gradual opening, and 
quieter operation (at least that&#39;s my theory).
<br clear="left"/></p><p>
The pipes themselves are of course much wider, so I used plastic tubing to
connect the valves to their corresponding pipes.</p><p>

<b>Valve block details</b></p><p>
The original experimental pipes I built were of a difficult design to execute,
as the front of the pipe was actually sandwiched between the two sides.  This
was good for initial experiments, especially when testing the pipes for different 
configurations before I glued them, but not for making large numbers of them.
</p><p>
The next pipe design I came up with is much easier to build:
</p><p>
<b>Pipe Design</b></p><p>

This design does have a major weakness in that the block &#39;B&#39; must be
precisely fit into the slot.  If it is too narrow, air escapes from the side.
</p><hr/>
<h2>Construction</h2>
<p>
Using this design, I built about 3 octaves worth of pipes.  I varied the
geometry as I scaled the pipes, so that long pipes were more slender with
respect to their length than the short ones.  This produced a louder sound
in the higher octaves.  I also found out that pipes that are long and slender are
much easier to tune, and keep their pitch much better across a wider range of 
operating pressures and surrounding geometries.
</p><p>
I did run out of time that Christmas holiday, but the result was already playable.
I didn&#39;t obtain a better air pump than the vacuum cleaner motor.  So what I did is
put the vacuum cleaner motor into a box, which was surrounded by foam, which was
contained in a box of 2&#34; hardwood, which I surrounded by foam, which I put into
a cardboard box.  With the vacuum cleaner running at about 40 volts to get the right
pressure, the noise was tolerable.
</p><p>
I took what I had with me back to University, and set it up in the living room
of the house where I lived.  Even though we had a modular MOOG and a Jupiter 6
synthesizer set up in our &#39;studio&#39;, my house mate Keith and I ended up playing 
with that organ an awful lot.  4 months later I had to re-varnish the keyboard.  
We had worn four layers of varnish straight off the keys!
</p><ul>

</ul>
The valve blocks are pulled by the steel wires, which are simply twisted onto a nail
sticking out of the back of each key.  This is primitive, but works quite well.  Being
able to adjust the length of the wire by twisting it slightly is important, as it
determines how far down the keys are when not pushed.  If the keys are not level
it looks really dumb.
<p>
Also, note the yellow spacers between the keys.  These are to keep the keys from
rubbing against each other directly, and also reduce friction.  In the winter, 
I always need to add some spacers to get the keyboard to feel &#39;tight&#39;, while in the
summer, I have to remove them.  This is all caused by wood 
<a href="http://woodgears.ca/wood_grain/shrinkage.html">shrinkage and expansion</a> from 
changes in humidity.
</p><ul>

</ul>
<p>
I hadn&#39;t had time to build a stand, so all the pipes were just stacked under the
keyboard unit in that first setup.  Some were dangling from their plastic hoses,
some stacked with wooden
blocks between them.  This was a terribly precarious arrangement.  Every time
the stack of pipes was bumped, they shifted slightly, and would alter their 
tuning.  The sound of these pipes is very sensitive to their immediate surroundings,
I discovered.
</p><ul>
<img alt="Ends of the pipes" width="594" height="393" src="https://antiantihuman.com/pipe_ends.jpg"/>
</ul>

<p>
I spent a lot of the next 4 months fine tuning some of the pipes, as well as 
adding felt under the keys to dampen the noise they made when they hit bottom.
</p><p>
Tuning the pipes without having convenient access to a woodworking shop was also
more difficult.  They way I had originally tuned them was to tune my Commodore 64
to the pitch the pipe was playing, then work out the frequency I had tuned the
computer to, calculate the corresponding reduction in length of the pipe, marked it
on the pipe, and then took it to the shop to cut the pipe off on a band saw.
This worked for tuning up.  For tuning
down, I could place a small block of wood in the end of the pipe to reduce the
pitch.  For minor increases in pitch, I also ended up flaring the end of the pipe
with a knife.
</p><p>
I also ended up finally replacing the vacuum cleaner motor with something
more elegant.  It turns out that running at about 40 volts 
for extended periods was not good for the
vacuum cleaner motor.  Carbon deposited between the copper contacts on the
commutator, and then conducted electricity and started to smolder.  My theory was that the motor&#39;s 
design intended for centrifugal force to clear the carbon dust from the
commutator, but at the low speeds at which I was running it, this didn&#39;t happen.
</p><ul>
<img alt="Organ pump &amp; motor" width="555" height="386" src="https://antiantihuman.com/organ_pump.jpg"/>
</ul>

After the vacuum cleaner motor died, I was very lucky to find a 
1/12&#39;th Hp motor and precision blower at Princes Auto (A surplus store), 
for a grand total of $20.  I used a scrounged O-ring as a belt, and adapted
the paper feed pulley from an old teletype by sanding an indentation into
it for the O-ring to run in.  The pulley on the blower also needed modifications,
so I removed the shaft and cut a groove for the O-ring into it on a metal lathe
in the student machine shop at the University.
<p>
This combination I placed in the box I had built of 2&#34; planks.  The combination
was so quiet that its noise became a total non-issue.  At about the same time
the real vacuum cleaner we were using in the house died, and I was able to reuse
the bearings from that motor to fix our actual vacuum cleaner.
</p><ul>
<img alt="The organ in the &#39;studio&#39;" width="640" height="437" src="https://antiantihuman.com/studio.jpg"/>
</ul>
<p>
We had quite the studio setup at the time.
Bottom right is the pipe organ, behind it the Jupiter 6.  To the left is
the modular MOOG synthesizer (two VCO&#39;s 1 VCF, 2 envelope generators).
In the back is one of our reel to reel tape decks, the drum machine,
and a DSP sound processor box.
</p><p>
Also note the knife set on the cardboard box in front.  I used the knife
set for tweaking the wooden pipes, and the cardboard box it is resting on 
has the vacuum motor blower in it (for extra insulation)
If you are wondering, the box in the back IS a box for a lava lamp.

<h2>Finishing up the organ</h2>
<p>
<img alt="Pipes being glued" width="450" height="306" src="https://antiantihuman.com/gluing.jpg"/>
<b>Gluing the 4 ft C, D, and D# pipes</b></p><p>
Later that year, after graduating from University, I spent another week
in my dad&#39;s shop and finished it up.  I had previously not fully &#39;populated&#39; all
the possible notes of the keyboard.  I rebuilt the uppermost half octave
to change the aspect ratio, and extended the range by half an 
octave at the top, and three notes at the bottom.
Before this, the organ&#39;s bottom octave, and top half octave keys only
made an air escaping type of noise when they were pressed.

<img alt="Pressure regulator" width="500" height="375" src="https://antiantihuman.com/regulator.jpg"/>
<b>Pressure regulator, with rocks to control pressure and foot pedal</b>
</p><p>
I also built a pressure regulator for the organ.  This regulator
consists of a simple bellow, about 20cm x 20cm, but with only 3 cm
of travel.  This bellow was not so much intended for a reservoir,
but more as a pressure sensor.  When the bellow falls, the valve at the
bottom of the bellow opens further to let more air from the blower in,
thus maintaining the pressure.  The
pressure can be varied by piling various amounts of rocks on top of 
the bellow, as well as by a special foot pedal which can be used to apply
extra pressure to the bellow for &#39;expression&#39;.

I contemplated building a better organ with multiple registers.
I got as far as making a few drawings on the computer, but then abandoned it.
