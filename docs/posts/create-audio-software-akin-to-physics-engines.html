    <h1>Ask HN: Create audio software akin to physics engines?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I used to think that alot of physics was bs until I found a tutorial on Box 2D physics.</p><p>The tutorials used real physics concepts, like momentum, coefficient of friction and others to simultate physical (mechanical properties of items on a computer).</p><p>I found the same in physically based rendering/ray tracing where real Physics concepts from how light behaves were used to create virtual simulations that resembled those in reality.</p><p>Here is my question, are there any resources on how someone can simulate 
sound using software. Like howling of wind, the sound from musical instruments.</p><p>Are there any good study resources, sample tools or theories (what is the &#34;PBR or ray tracing of audio&#34; ?)</p><p>What is this field called? I am assuming it has something to do with the physics field of acoustics?</p><p>The I would like to build a software tool for creating such audio simulation i.e a &#34;box2d physics&#34; library but for audio is the elevator pitch.</p><p>Thanks</p></div></div></div>
