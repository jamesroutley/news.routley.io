    <h1>AI tools are making the world look weird</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="04147a8" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"> <div> <p>In academia and the media, AI is often described as mirroring human psychology with <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/chain-of-thought-prompting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>humanlike reasoning</span></a>, <a href="https://www.psypost.org/ai-reaches-human-level-performance-on-general-intelligence-test-what-does-it-mean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>human-level performance</span></a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/may/14/ai-can-spontaneously-develop-human-like-communication-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>human-like communication</span></a>. In these comparisons, “humans” are treated as the benchmark.</p><p>In a provocative <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/5b26t_v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>2023 paper</span></a>, researchers at Harvard University asked – which humans?</p><p>The diversity of human psychologies has been a hot topic since 2010, when researchers found that many accepted psychological “truths” were often confined to so-called “WEIRD people”: Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, Democratic. What feel like universal beliefs for people like me and no doubt many of the readers of this blog, e.g. that I am an automonous individual, are instead only true for a thin slice of humanity.</p><p>So when we say AI tools are “human-like”, what we mean is that AI is WEIRD.</p><p>In fact, this paper found that more than that, it thinks American. The greater the cultural distance between a country and the USA, the less accurate ChatGPT got at simulating peoples’ values. For countries like Libya and Pakistan, AI results are little better than a coin toss.</p> </div> </div></div>
