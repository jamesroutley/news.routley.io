          <div><p><span lang="EN-GB">Floods, droughts, and rising food prices have marked the start of this year, underscoring the urgency of tackling the UK’s environmental crises. Communities are still reeling from floods, while the UK Government continues to blame nature for housing shortages. 2025 broke historical records, with provisional Met Office figures showing it was the UK’s warmest and sunniest year on record, highlighting the accelerating climate emergency. Reports continued to emerge of severe wildlife declines and threats to species and habitats.*</span><span> </span></p></div>

          <div><div><h2><span lang="EN-GB">2026 marks the 5<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the Environment Act</span><span> </span></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Environment Act legally commits the UK to targets for land, water, and sea by 2030. The long-delayed Environment Improvement Plan (EIP), published in December 2025, should outline how these targets will be met. Yet the Office for Environmental Protection warns the Government is “largely off track” to meet its targets on biodiversity and its 30 by 30 commitments. </span><span> </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Prime Minister and Chancellor need to understand that meeting our environmental targets isn’t optional - it’s a legal obligation. Yet recent planning reforms, proposed further changes and weakened Biodiversity Net Gain rules represent the worst setback to protections since the 1940s. This Government is acting as if voters don’t care about nature, despite Wildlife Trust surveys showing 93% of people see loss of nature and climate change as serious threats<sup>1</sup>.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Nature protections underpin our economy and safety. They prevent flooding, secure water supplies, and support food production. A nation that undermines nature is a house of cards with shaky foundations.</span><span> </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">It is vital that the UK Government improves its focus on supporting nature-friendly farmers and restoring rivers, lakes and streams to make us more resilient to the climate crisis. Changes to farming practices, like improving soil health, growing trees and habitats, buffering rivers and restoring peat soils will all help store, slow and clean our water systems and reduce soil run off into rivers. But farmers can’t do this without the right financial support and advice. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">It must recognise that the nature and climate crises are the biggest long-term threats to economic growth. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">This year, with elections in Scotland and Wales and local elections in England, millions of voters will be heading to ballot boxes with nature in mind. The Government can listen to the growing demand for more environmental ambition by taking action to: </span><span> </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-GB">1. Stop environmental regression and breaking nature promises</span><span> </span></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">2025 was dominated by rhetoric blaming the housing crisis on jumping spiders, newts and bats, with calls to “tear down barriers” to growth. But blaming nature makes no sense: economic growth and nature recovery can go hand in hand. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">By embedding nature recovery into our economic plans, we can tackle the challenges of economic shocks from climate chaos, development and housing. We must see strong leadership around properly enforced regulation, to provide simplicity and certainty for business and to drive innovation. Planning reform must also integrate green spaces into housing and ensure major projects avoid harming protected sites.</span><span> </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Prime Minister’s endorsement of bypassing environmental rules contradicts the Environmental Improvement Plan (EIP) and risks deepening public distrust.</span><span> </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">England’s rivers are </span><a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/blog/ali-morse/it-happy-birthday-water-framework-directive"><span lang="EN-GB">among the most polluted in Europe</span></a><span lang="EN-GB">, with poor water quality affecting every waterway. </span><span>This is bad for wildlife and bad for people’s health. </span><span lang="EN-GB">The Cunliffe report’s recommendations, including a catchment-based approach to tackle all pollution sources, must be implemented through the Water Reform Bill.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The Wildlife Trusts propose a </span><a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/news/new-policy-proposal-wilder-river-banks-key-reversing-river-decline"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Wilder River Banks</strong></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> policy to restore land along waterways, which would: </span><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">create a stronger barrier against pollution from surrounding fields</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">provide a boost for nature recovery</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">create new income opportunities for farmers</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">offer protection against flooding, and</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">contribute to climate and public health efforts</span><span> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">This holistic approach - linking riverbank restoration with catchment plans and river channel improvements - offers the best chance to meet legal obligations and public expectations.</span><span> </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><span>Some powerful people continue to downplay climate change</span><span lang="EN-GB">, yet climate change is driving more frequent floods and droughts, threatening food security and public safety. </span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Nature-based solutions, such as restoring wetlands and woodlands, can, if given the chance, hold back floodwaters, reduce drought impacts, and prevent pollution. Thriving ecosystems provide the pollinators, healthy soils, and clean water that sustain us. The Government must deliver a cross-departmental climate adaptation plan, which was a serious omission from the Environmental Improvement Plan.</span></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Farmers face rising climate risks with instability and unpredictable weather patterns. Embracing nature-friendly practices, including organic and regenerative farming, can increase profitability and improve food security. </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">These practices focus on:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">restoring soil health</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">increasing wildlife</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">reducing chemical inputs</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Public investment is essential to help farmers transition and ensure food security. With 70% of UK land farmed, agricultural policy must reward nature-friendly and climate resilient farming. From pollinating our crops to helping to tackle climate change, our natural systems provide a whole range of public goods, and we must value this far more fairly at the farm gate.</span><span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Post-Brexit, Parliament agreed that public money should deliver public goods. Yet progress has stalled. Environmental Land Management schemes must urgently get back on track. </span><span> </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">The UK is legally committed to protecting 30% of land and sea by 2030, but progress is woefully inadequate. Just 3% of land and 9.5% of seas are currently protected. </span><a href="https://stateofnature.org.uk/" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><u>The State of Nature report</u></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> revealed that one in six species is at risk of extinction in Great Britain, underscoring the need for immediate and decisive action. A clear delivery plan is needed, including:</span><span> </span></p>
<ul>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">establishing a temperate rainforest programme</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">strengthening protections for Local Wildlife Sites</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">restoring and re-wiggling rivers</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">increasing tree cover in towns and cities</span></li>
<li><span lang="EN-GB">reintroducing species like beavers to slow floods and improve water quality</span><span> </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">This isn’t just about wildlife - it’s about people, too. Access to nature improves physical and mental health, reduces healthcare costs, and creates happier communities. Achieving 30 by 30 would ensure wildlife-rich spaces in every community, delivering benefits for generations to come.</span><span> </span></p>
<h2></h2>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Nature and climate crises are the biggest long-term threats to economic growth and public health. The UK Government must act decisively in 2026 to reverse environmental regression and deliver on its legal commitments. Restoring nature is not a barrier to progress. It’s the foundation of a safe, prosperous future.</span><span> </span></p>
