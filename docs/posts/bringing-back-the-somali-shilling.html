In fact, the disappearance of the producer of money would tend to make it more valuable as they are still held and something must be used.  Counterfeiters are an interesting case as they would lower the value.  I wonder who first accepted it and whether the counterfeiter had to assure they would accept it in return.  Perhaps being so close to production value limited the value of counterfeiting.  I wonder if the problem with dollars is they come in too large of denominations to be useful to the users of it.  Pennies would work at that level, but perhaps not at lesser levels.  Coins would seem to make more sense but even the US loses money on low value coinage.  The problem may be they are at the commodity bound with no means of producing money of such low value.  </p><p><span><a target="_self" data-comment-id="3365907150895799640">Reply</a><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6704573462403312459&amp;postID=3365907150895799640">Delete</a></span></span></p></div><div><div id="c3365907150895799640-rt"><p><span><span></span><span><a target="_self">Replies</a></span></span></p><ol id="c3365907150895799640-ra"><div><li id="c233174506941028597"><p><img src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-1mujPnm6Yr-W-HcpzB7DUsDdsjlYEbZ0j9rt1llyMdTyOc38wraqqoe0zOMORZ8dRnh3Eai79bZZn3qNuNLBVAvHQmBSh3R2RmMgmiJe2urga5XfACdi9oXR1fz5xF4/s52/oneVariable.PNG" alt=""/></p><div><p>&#34;Value doesn&#39;t disappear overnight.

When fiat gets started, it must be tied to some commodity or asset.  And the reason fiat currencies continue to hold value after the redemption for commodities or assets is suspended is because people anticipate that the monetary authority will either choose to, or have to, re-open those redemption channels at some point in the future.  </p><p><span><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6704573462403312459&amp;postID=3030656233196410388">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></li><li id="c2631644134928656462"><p><img src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-1mujPnm6Yr-W-HcpzB7DUsDdsjlYEbZ0j9rt1llyMdTyOc38wraqqoe0zOMORZ8dRnh3Eai79bZZn3qNuNLBVAvHQmBSh3R2RmMgmiJe2urga5XfACdi9oXR1fz5xF4/s52/oneVariable.PNG" alt=""/></p><div><p>I wouldn&#39;t write of #1 so quickly.

Let&#39;s imagine that Somalis somehow knew, on good authority, that no central bank would ever buy back their old shillings for a billion years, until the sun burned out.  What would happen?  Nothing, I predict.  The old shillings would continue to trade at around 4 cents/shilling, or whatever the cost of printing counterfeit shillings would be.  </p><p><span><a target="_self" data-comment-id="7699502930311869801">Reply</a><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6704573462403312459&amp;postID=7699502930311869801">Delete</a></span></span></p></div><div><div id="c7699502930311869801-rt"><p><span><span></span><span><a target="_self">Replies</a></span></span></p><ol id="c7699502930311869801-ra"><div><li id="c2223079567849056761"><p><img src="http://resources.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif" alt=""/></p><div><p>To elaborate:  let&#39;s imagine that this old shilling becomes less popular as a medium of exchange.  Then its price will temporarily dip below its price of production, which will bring to a halt any further efforts to counterfeit new shillings.  With the supply of new shillings no longer increasing, any revival in demand for the shilling to be used as money will bring its price back up to the price of production, or even over the price of production, at which point more shillings will be produced to drive its price back down to its production price, and so on.  This is also how gold production was (and still is) regulated by Adam Smith&#39;s &#34;Invisible Hand.&#34;  </p><p><span><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6704573462403312459&amp;postID=2223079567849056761">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></li><li id="c5690927069909883334"><p><img src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-1mujPnm6Yr-W-HcpzB7DUsDdsjlYEbZ0j9rt1llyMdTyOc38wraqqoe0zOMORZ8dRnh3Eai79bZZn3qNuNLBVAvHQmBSh3R2RmMgmiJe2urga5XfACdi9oXR1fz5xF4/s52/oneVariable.PNG" alt=""/></p><div><p>When central banks stop accepting a currency as their liability, i.e. when it is demonetized, it usually doesn&#39;t continue to circulate as money, even though it has a long history of use.

Hilariously, the only time individuals insisted on using the shilling was for large purchases - like a car or property. The person would then require a wheelbarrow or a truck with security detail to transfer the money and make the transaction. From what I could tell, it was entirely a formality to present social status of wealth with no actual necessity. The other advantage of the mobile payment system was the ability to disguise price fluctuations per person... a hotel room advertises 300 USD per night, but what you pay depends on your relationship to the manager, and no reference to price is ever spoken aloud. I imagine in Somalia that the hard currency will remain only ceremonial (which is expensive) and the central bank will manage exchange with intent that all transactions to remain wireless. </p><p><span><a target="_self" data-comment-id="7143606703672781213">Reply</a><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6704573462403312459&amp;postID=7143606703672781213">Delete</a></span></span></p></div><div><div id="c7143606703672781213-rt"><p><span><span></span><span><a target="_self">Replies</a></span></span></p><ol id="c7143606703672781213-ra"><div><li id="c7465693471992114901"><p><img src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-1mujPnm6Yr-W-HcpzB7DUsDdsjlYEbZ0j9rt1llyMdTyOc38wraqqoe0zOMORZ8dRnh3Eai79bZZn3qNuNLBVAvHQmBSh3R2RmMgmiJe2urga5XfACdi9oXR1fz5xF4/s52/oneVariable.PNG" alt=""/></p><div><p>Great anecdote.

It has become actual money - you stated it yourself - the 1,000 shilling note - &#34;real&#34; or &#34;counterfeit&#34; is valued at the cost of the paper and ink it is made with. It is valued as a medium of exchange based on its portability, acceptance and the value of the raw material and efforts that went into creating it - just a few cents. This is the true paper equivalent of metal coinage. This is as close to real money as paper can ever get - they&#39;ve done it - and it works. </p><p><span><a target="_self" data-comment-id="1040650366802334868">Reply</a><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6704573462403312459&amp;postID=1040650366802334868">Delete</a></span></span></p></div><div><div id="c1040650366802334868-rt"><p><span><span></span><span><a target="_self">Replies</a></span></span></p><ol id="c1040650366802334868-ra"><div><li id="c214064196368571825"><p><img src="http://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEi-1mujPnm6Yr-W-HcpzB7DUsDdsjlYEbZ0j9rt1llyMdTyOc38wraqqoe0zOMORZ8dRnh3Eai79bZZn3qNuNLBVAvHQmBSh3R2RmMgmiJe2urga5XfACdi9oXR1fz5xF4/s52/oneVariable.PNG" alt=""/></p><div><p>Yep, good point.

MMTers consider issuing a currency to be an important part of national sovereignty.  Do you think issuing a currency can offer some degree of fiscal flexibility for a nation like somalia, or would it be worse off, due to inflation risks, if it tried to use its own currency as a fiscal tool? What kinds of issues do CBs in these kinds of countries deal with? I imagine that external financial entities, like the IMF, play a significant role. Depending on your perspective that role could be considered friendly support or a continuation of colonization. Do you see any good political reasons to issue your own currency, or are these countries better off if they don&#39;t try to undertake that burden?</p><p><span><a target="_self" data-comment-id="6537477186632100510">Reply</a><span><a target="_self" href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6704573462403312459&amp;postID=6537477186632100510">Delete</a></span></span></p></div></li><li id="c6642202790861218261"><p><img src="http://resources.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif" alt=""/></p><div><p>What about the make up of the Somali society, as a homogeneous society, where trust plays a strong role in social interactions.
