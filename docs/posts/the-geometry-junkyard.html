    <h1>The Geometry Junkyard</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<!--#config timefmt="%d %h %Y, %T %Z" -->

<hr/><p>These pages contain usenet clippings, web pointers,
lecture notes, research excerpts, papers, abstracts, programs, problems,
and other stuff related
to discrete and computational geometry.
Some of it is quite serious, but I hope much of it is also entertaining.
The main criteria for adding something here are that it be geometrical
(obviously) and that it not fit into my other geometry page,
<a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/geom.html">Geometry in Action</a>,
which is more devoted to applications and less to pure math.
I also have another page on non-geometrical
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/recmath.html">recreational math</a>.</p>
