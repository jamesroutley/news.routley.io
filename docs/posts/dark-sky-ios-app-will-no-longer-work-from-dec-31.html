      <p><strong>Update: </strong>As previously announced, the Dark Sky iOS app will no longer be available beginning on December 31st, 2022 and, as of this date, already purchased versions of the app will no longer provide weather data. The Dark Sky API and website will continue to function until March 31st, 2023.</p>
      <p>Dark Sky&#39;s forecast technology is now enhanced and integrated into the all-new Apple Weather forecast, powering Apple’s updated Weather app. Click <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/weather/id1069513131">here</a> to learn more.</p>
      <p>Developers, Apple’s new WeatherKit API lets you incorporate Apple Weather forecast data into your app and is available for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and web. Learn more <a href="https://developer.apple.com/weatherkit/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Today we have some important and exciting news to share: Dark Sky has joined Apple.</p>

<p>Our goal has always been to provide the world with the best weather information possible, to help as many people as we can stay dry and safe, and to do so in a way that respects your privacy.</p>

<p>There is no better place to accomplish these goals than at Apple. We’re thrilled to have the opportunity to reach far more people, with far more impact, than we ever could alone.</p>


<h3>What happens to our existing products?</h3>
<p><em>iOS App</em></p>
<p>There will be no changes to Dark Sky for iOS at this time. It will continue to be available for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id517329357">purchase in the App Store.</a></p>
<p><em>Android and Wear OS App</em></p>
<p>The app will no longer be available for download. Service to existing users and subscribers will continue until July 1, 2020, at which point the app will be shut down. Subscribers who are still active at that time will receive a refund.</p>
<p><em>Website</em></p>
<p>Weather forecasts, maps, and embeds will continue until July 1, 2020. The website will remain active beyond that time in support of API and iOS App customers.</p>
<p><em>API</em></p>
<p>Our API service for existing customers is not changing today, but we will no longer accept new signups. The API will continue to function through the end of 2021.</p>

<p>As part of this transition, use of Dark Sky by Apple is subject to the Apple Privacy Policy, which can be found at apple.com/privacy.</p>

<h3>Thank you!</h3>
<p>To our customers, family and friends, we are grateful for your support over the past eight years. We look forward to continuing to build great products, so stay tuned…</p>
<p>The Dark Sky Team</p>
