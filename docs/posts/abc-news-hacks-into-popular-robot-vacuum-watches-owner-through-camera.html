Many required physically connecting to the robots, or even pulling them apart to get at their insides.</p><p>He doesn&#39;t report the low-risk threats. But this one was especially sensitive.</p><p>Giese quickly notified Ecovacs, saying he&#39;d found a serious security flaw that could be carried out remotely. (He omitted specific details as he didn&#39;t want to reveal them over an insecure channel<strong> </strong>and still has not published them publicly).</p><p>That was in December 2023. Ten months ago.</p><p>&#34;We never heard back,&#34; he says.</p><p>Until he went public with his findings, that is.</p><p>&#34;The company kind of woke up and were like, &#39;Oh yeah, yeah, we somehow missed the e-mail like in December&#39;.</p><p>&#34;For a billion-dollar company, who is a market leader nowadays, that&#39;s a little bit worrisome.&#34;</p><p><span data-component="Loading" data-print="inline-media"><span></span><span role="alert" aria-live="assertive">Loading...</span></span></p><p>Giese&#39;s interest lies in gaining access to the devices, not spying on people with them.</p><p>Still, it only took him a &#34;couple of hours&#34; to work out how to take the photos, send them to his own server, and play a custom audio recording through its speakers.</p><p>At one point in our experiment, Giese seemed to get impatient with his hastily written script.</p><p>He jokingly suggested &#34;bricking&#34; — which means permanently disabling a computer — Sean&#39;s device, a sign of how much damage he could do without either of us having laid eyes on the thing.</p><p><em>Dennis Giese: </em>Okay, let me do something scary</p><p>Should I brick his robot?</p><p><em>Julian Fell: </em>Hahaha no no. [We] need to do the hack right</p><p>And, in the end, we put things right. No trace was left on Sean&#39;s device, and he took his robot home, spooked as he was about what it all meant for his family&#39;s privacy.</p><p>&#34;I&#39;ve started just tossing a little dishcloth on it when it&#39;s not in use,&#34; he said.</p><p>It was a wake-up call for Sean, but risks to privacy in the modern world go far beyond a single product.</p><p>&#34;People don&#39;t think of their dishwasher as a robot,&#34; says Dr Donald Dansereau, senior lecturer at the Australian Centre for Robotics at the University of Sydney.</p><p>We live in a &#34;camera-rich society&#34;, he says. &#34;Robot vacuums get a lot of flak because they&#39;re so visible.</p><p>&#34;When you go outside, you see cars driving around with all kinds of cameras on them. The cameras are always on, always watching.&#34;</p><p>And when there are cameras everywhere, it raises questions about how secure the footage is.</p><p>Ecovacs initially said its users &#34;do not need to worry excessively&#34; about Giese&#39;s findings.</p><p>After he first revealed the vulnerability in public, the company&#39;s security committee <a href="https://twitter.com/lorenzofb/status/1823774980460388675" data-component="Link">downplayed the issue</a>, saying it requires &#34;specialised hacking tools and physical access to the device&#34;.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to square their statement with the reality. All it had taken was my $300 smartphone, and I hadn&#39;t even laid eyes on Sean&#39;s robot until after hacking into it.</p><p>Ecovacs eventually said it would fix this security issue. At the time of publication, only some models have been updated to prevent this attack.</p><p>Several models — including the latest flagship model released in July this year — remain vulnerable.</p><figure role="group" data-print="inline-media" aria-labelledby="104428484" data-component="Figure" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/104428484"><div><p><img alt="An Ecovacs robot on a kitchen floor, and its owner crouching over it" sizes="100vw" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/02c1c07bf19779069678b048ec9d22fb?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=2167&amp;cropW=3250&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=0&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/></p></div><figcaption id="104428484" data-component="Figure__figcaption"> <!-- -->The Ecovacs X2 is vulnerable to hacking from over 100 metres away.<cite data-component="Figure__cite">(<span data-component="Byline"><span data-component="Text"><span>ABC News: Esther Linder</span></span></span>)</cite></figcaption></figure><p>Clearly, Sean&#39;s robot is one of them.

He claims that at least five of the standard&#39;s 13 provisions weren&#39;t met by the Ecovacs X2 when he tested it.</p><p>The vulnerabilities that Giese found were not examined as part of the testing, wrote Schneider, &#34;as it falls within the scope of professional hacking attacks&#34;.</p><p>What he&#39;s saying is that TUV Rheinland&#39;s certification doesn&#39;t promise to prevent cyber attacks by serious hackers.</p><p>But isn&#39;t that exactly who is most likely to carry them out?</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Seeking a second opinion</h2><p>Lim Yong Zhi, a former cybersecurity tester at rival certification company TÜV SÜD, has hands-on experience certifying robot vacuums to the same standard.</p><p>He says the testing process is largely &#34;left open for interpretation&#34; by certification companies.</p><p>In his view, it does not require that testers cover &#34;in-depth or professional attacks&#34;.</p><figure role="group" data-print="inline-media" aria-labelledby="104428514" data-component="Figure" data-uri="coremedia://imageproxy/104428514"><div><p><img alt="A group of people in high-viz vests stand in a row with a drone on the ground in front of them" sizes="100vw" src="https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/fafda7d9465f38a6edaea1a12f2e452e?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&amp;cropH=1333&amp;cropW=2000&amp;xPos=0&amp;yPos=0&amp;width=862&amp;height=575" loading="lazy" data-component="Image" data-lazy="true"/></p></div><figcaption id="104428514" data-component="Figure__figcaption"> <!-- -->Lim Yong Zhi (third from right) was a cybersecurity tester at TÜV SÜD for five years.<cite data-component="Figure__cite">(<span data-component="Byline"><span data-component="Text"><span>Supplied: Lim Yong Zhi</span></span></span>)</cite></figcaption></figure><p>&#34;These products face very tight timelines to launch onto the market,&#34; Lim explained.</p><p>While the standard specifies that common security features must be present, he says, there is no explicit requirement that they are implemented correctly.</p><p>&#34;It depends on the experience of the laboratory as well as the personnel who is handling the device for cyber security testing.&#34;</p><p>And it&#39;s only meaningful at one snapshot in time. Often, testing is done before the product is released, while new, unforeseen cyber threats are emerging all the time.</p><p>The software that runs on smart devices needs to be updated regularly to keep up with the latest known issues. And each new version of the software uploaded to the robot can potentially introduce new vulnerabilities.</p><p>It would be impractical to independently test each new version, says Lim, as it can take months to complete the process.</p><p>Given this, he believes product labelling that shows devices meet certification standards may provide a &#34;false sense of security&#34; to consumers.</p><p>&#34;Of course, it is very difficult… there&#39;s no way to tell if [the devices] are secure.&#34;</p><p>A spokesperson from Australia&#39;s Department of Home Affairs says the government plans to introduce mandatory security standards for smart devices, with enforcement provisions planned to &#34;prevent non-compliant devices from being sold in Australia&#34;.</p><p>They did not comment on the effectiveness of the ETSI EN 303 645 standard, which has been mentioned in public consultation materials as a potential baseline for adoption.</p><p>&#34;As the security needs of different types of smart devices evolve, so too will the Australian government ensure the appropriate security standards apply to them.&#34;</p><p>The Ecovacs spokesperson noted that the company is &#34;proactively exploring more comprehensive testing methods&#34;.</p><p>For Dennis Giese, the most concerning aspect of the Bluetooth attack is how hard it is to detect.</p><p>&#34;If you do it in a very silent way, [the victim] would never figure it out,&#34; he says.</p><p>The warning sound does not play. The vacuum robot continues to clean as normal. And it leaves no trace on the device afterwards.</p><p>All of this combines to mean there&#39;s no way of knowing if shady organisations are already using it for nefarious purposes.</p><p>Giese does this work in his spare time, spending his own money on robots to test.</p><p>&#34;Imagine you have a whole department of people who are kind of doing that stuff like all day long,&#34; he says.</p><p>And then, one day after going public with his findings, he didn&#39;t have to imagine anymore.</p><p>An employee of a notorious CIA contractor approached him, and asked a haunting question.</p><p>&#34;[He] said, &#39;hey, do you think we can use... the cameras and microphones to find people?&#39;&#34;</p><h2 data-component="Heading">Credits</h2></div></div></div><p><span data-component="Text">Posted<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2024-10-03T18:47:58.000Z">3 Oct 2024</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2024-10-03T18:47:58.000Z">3 Oct 2024</time><time data-component="Text">Thu 3 Oct 2024 at 6:47pm</time>, <span data-component="Text">updated<!-- --> </span><time data-component="Timestamp" aria-hidden="true" datetime="2024-10-03T23:44:11.000Z">3 Oct 2024</time><time data-component="ScreenReaderOnly" datetime="2024-10-03T23:44:11.000Z">3 Oct 2024</time><time data-component="Text">Thu 3 Oct 2024 at 11:44pm</time></p></div>
