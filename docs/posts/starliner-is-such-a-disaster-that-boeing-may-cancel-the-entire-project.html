    <h1>Starliner Is Such a Disaster That Boeing May Cancel the Entire Project</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="incArticle"><p>Over the weekend, NASA finally announced its decision: Boeing&#39;s plagued <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/nasa-dumps-boeing-starliner-spacex">Starliner is coming back empty-handed</a>.</p><p>Instead, NASA astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams — who flew up on the troubled capsule — will get a ride on board SpaceX&#39;s Crew Dragon <a href="https://futurism.com/stranded-astronauts-stuck-space-station-nasa">in February</a>. It&#39;s an extremely unfortunate development for Boeing, a company that has been <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/russia-offers-boeing-fix-starliner">battling with Starliner&#39;s development</a> for years now.</p><p>Technical mishaps, supply chain issues, and many years of delays have resulted in a whopping $1.6 billion budget overrun since 2016, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/astronauts-plight-piles-pressure-boeings-struggling-space-unit-2024-08-26/"><em>Reuters</em> reports</a>.</p><p>But NASA is now focused just on getting Starliner back in one piece.</p><p>&#34;I am not sure the decision will ultimately be NASA&#39;s,&#34; former NASA deputy administrator Lori Garver told <em>Reuters </em>when asked if Boeing would stay in NASA&#39;s Commercial Crew program. &#34;Boeing is going to have to foot much of this bill, as they have been.&#34;</p><p>And when we asked Boeing whether Starliner might get canceled, the company didn&#39;t exactly jump to defend the project.</p><p>&#34;Boeing continues to focus, first and foremost, on the safety of the crew and spacecraft,&#34; a spokesperson said. &#34;We are executing the mission as determined by NASA, and we are preparing the spacecraft for a safe and successful uncrewed return.&#34;</p><p>Worse yet, NASA&#39;s inspector general <a href="https://futurism.com/nasa-inspector-boeing-work-moon-rocket">released a damning report earlier this month</a>, finding that Boeing&#39;s contributions to NASA&#39;s Moonbound Space Launch System are also many years behind and way over budget.</p><p>And that&#39;s not to mention years&#39; worth of <a href="https://futurism.com/boeing-planes-flying-safety">controversies plaguing Boeing&#39;s passenger jet business</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/boeing-ceo-calhoun-0abff1ccc6262ffb03f97c6a619bd1ec">executive shakeups</a>.</p><p>In short, Starliner&#39;s failure is only the tip of the iceberg, with analysts and industry experts raising doubts that the spacecraft will ever fly again, according to <em>Reuters</em>.</p><p>Boeing&#39;s first crewed test flight was designed to give NASA the confidence to certify it for regular crew rotation missions to the International Space Station, providing redundancy in case SpaceX&#39;s Crew Dragon were to get sidelined.</p><p>Instead, <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/boeing-thruster-issue-stranded-astronauts">nagging gas leaks and related thruster issues</a> raised enough doubts among space agency officials to have Wilmore and Williams ditch the spacecraft for their return, a black eye for a spacecraft that&#39;s already years behind and billions of dollars over budget.</p><p>&#34;Boeing&#39;s other businesses aren&#39;t terribly vulnerable to disruption,&#34; aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia told <em>Reuters</em>. &#34;But space? That&#39;s another story.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Do they ultimately exit the program because it’s too complicated and because the other guy can do it better?&#34; Melius Research analyst Robert Spingarn <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-25/boeing-ceo-faces-hard-decisions-after-nasa-s-starliner-rejection?sref=YfHlo0rL">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. &#34;It can happen.&#34;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-lockheed-martin-talks-sell-ula-sierra-space-2024-08-16/"><em>Reuters</em> reported earlier this month</a>, Boeing is even in talks to sell a joint rocket-launching business with the United Launch Alliance to the space company Sierra Space. Skilled workers are jumping ship and joining Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos&#39; Blue Origin.</p><p>Meanwhile, time is running out for Starliner. The ISS is <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/nasa-spacecraft-destroy-iss">set to be retired around 2030</a> and it&#39;s already been five years since Boeing&#39;s first uncrewed Starliner test flight <a href="https://futurism.com/boeings-starliner-fails-first-attempt-reach-iss">ended in failure</a>.</p><p>Whether the capsule could serve as a way to deliver astronauts to a <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/spacex-signs-deal-launch-private-space-station">private successor to the space station</a> feels like a risky gamble.</p><p><strong>More on Starliner:</strong> <em><a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/boeing-starliner-destroy-malfunctioning-thrusters">When Boeing&#39;s Starliner Comes Back Empty, It&#39;ll Destroy the Malfunctioning Thrusters, Making It Impossible to Study What Went Wrong</a></em></p></section></div>
