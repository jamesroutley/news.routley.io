    <h1>J-CIA64 – Modern spare part for Commodore 64, Commodore 128, SX-64</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><img src="https://erikarow.land/articles/JCIA64_2.JPG" alt="J-CIA, J-CIA64, J6526, FPGA 6526 / 8521"/></p><h2>Modern spare part for Commodore 64, Commodore 128, SX-64 and 1570/1571 -drives</h2>

<li>FPGA based replacement for MOS 6526 &amp; 8521 CIA chips</li>
<li>Complete logic and all features of the original IC&#39;s implemented</li>
<li>All diagnostic &amp; software tests passed 100%, including all tests in Wolfgang Lorenz&#39;s test suite and Vice-project&#39;s CIA-tests.</li>
<li>[Vice&#39;s ciaports-tests may show partly incorrect results, but then again, original cias show variable results too.]</li>
<li>Hundreds of demos and games already tested, no known compatibility issues currently</li>
<li>Physically about the same size as the original CIAs</li>
<li>Lots of hardware tested and found to be compatible including (but not limited to) WifiModem, Ultimate-II+, SD2IEC, TapeCart, 1351-mouse</li>
<li>Tested with all C64 mainboard revisions, SX-64 and with EVO64 mainboard, Commodore 128 (including CP/M and disk drive burst-mode) and 1570 &amp; 1571.</li>
<li>Works in 1 MHz and 2 MHz modes.</li>
<li>This 6526/8521 version has been tested to work on a 1581 drive too by a betatester, but full compatibility cannot be guaranteed.
</li><li>(8520 Amiga -version would be the correct one for 1581)</li>
<li> </li>
<li><SPAN color="red">This &#34;J-CIA64&#34; -version is not compatible with Amiga / 8520-CIA and cannot be later converted or upgraded to be.</SPAN></li>
<li>Amiga -compatible version will be a separate product that will be released later.</li>

<h3>Changing mode between 8521 &#34;new&#34; and 6526 &#34;old&#34; CIA:</h3>
<li>Mode between new (8521) and old (6526) cia type can be changed</li>
<li>with a solder jumper on the underside of J-CIA64</li>
<li>&#34;New&#34; 8521 mode is default and 6526-mode can be enabled by soldering</li>
<li>two pads together as in the right on the image below:</li>
<p><img src="https://erikarow.land/articles/mode-jumper.jpg" alt="J-CIA64 mode jumper"/></p><li>Usually, the mode doesn&#39;t need to be changed,</li>
<li>most sofware and hardware are designed to work with both versions.</li>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<li>Although J-CIA could be soldered directly to mainboard, using IC sockets is highly recommended.</li>
<li>Pins on J-CIA are gold plated round pins, which will work with all kinds of sockets, but</li>
<li>the pins are a bit thicker than original IC-pins, which may cause slight stress to some leaf-type</li>
<li>sockets. This is a the same with all reproduction IC&#39;s with turned pins. </li>
<li>Be careful when pressing the J-CIA into a socket and make sure it is aligned properly and </li>
<li>pressed down evenly to avoid bending or breaking of pins.</li>
<li> </li>
<li>J-CIA orientation: PIN 1 is marked with a number 1 on PCB. That should match PIN 1 position on mainboard.</li>
<li>There is also a half circle marked on the top of the J-CIA. This relates to the notch on original IC&#39;s and the notch on IC-sockets</li>
<li>On a C64 CIA PIN 1 is located on top left of the both CIA -locations.</li>
<li>On a C128 the other CIA position is &#34;upside-down&#34;, so be careful installing a new CIA the correct way</li>
<li> </li>
<li>Original RF-shields may require insulating, modifications or even removing.</li>
<li>Before turning on the power, check that the RF-shield metal does not touch J-CIA(s).</li>
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<li>J-CIA / J-CIA64 reproduces the functionality of the original MOS CIA&#39;s</li>
<li>Because it&#39;s a reproduction, it cannot be ever fully like the original.</li>
<li>Logic aims to be exactly like the original, but there may be differences that have not been found yet.</li>
<li>Electrically J-CIA is &#34;close enough&#34; to the original CIA, but it is not exactly the same.</li>
<li><i>Although tested with a lot of hardware and software, compatibility with all hardware and software cannot be guaranteed.</i></li>
<li>nstalling the J-CIA64 requires delicate handling and taking the proper precautions to prevent antistatic discharges.</li>
<li>The seller or manufacturer cannot be held responsible for any possible damage this product may cause to your</li>
<li>equipment due to incorrect installation or mishandling of the product.</li>
