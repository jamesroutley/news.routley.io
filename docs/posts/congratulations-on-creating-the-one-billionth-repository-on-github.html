            <section>
                <p>Ireland gets a lot of support and a lot of love from the international and Palestinian communities for our support for a Free Palestine. Unlike most countries, in Ireland the need for a liberated Palestine is a given, the default, and we are deeply pro-liberation and anti-genocide, having endured hundreds of years of occupation ourselves. We have turned out for protests in large numbers, and we have had numerous politicians take active and early stances.</p><p>That said, I truly believe that Ireland is failing Palestine.</p><p>Our convictions are high, but our actions are absent. We hold the right beliefs, and we are doing absolutely nothing with them.</p><p>We hold a privileged position in the world: being part of the &#34;West&#34;, being part of the EU, speaking English, having an important relationship with America, being the tech hub of Europe. It is our responsibility–especially as <a href="https://www.independent.ie/world-news/israel-is-starving-palestinians-envoy-tells-top-un-court/a1883696048.html?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">Israel is systematically starving Gaza</a>, and as Trump and Israel are planning to <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/02/05/trump-indicates-intent-escalate-ethnic-cleansing-gaza?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com" rel="noreferrer">ethnically cleanse Palestine</a> by forcibly moving Palestinians from Gaza–to use that privilege to support our occupied brethren.</p><p>Ireland should be all-out in our actions, doing 100% of our capacity to advocate for Palestine and to bring consequences to Israel. I doubt we are currently doing 1/1000th of what we could do.</p><p>Throughout Ireland, <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">BDS targets</a> like McDonalds and Dominos are open and profitable, instead of being boycotted to death. <a href="https://www.bdsmovement.net/news/coca-cola-quenching-israel%E2%80%99s-genocidal-soldiers%E2%80%99-thirst?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">Coca Cola</a> is still on the shelves.

And although it would be without doubt a win to get that signed, it has been significantly cut down to size, with services excluded, meaning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/26/ireland-bill-ban-imports-from-occupied-palestinian-territories?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">an economic impact of just €685,000</a>.

It is doing everything that it can to reduce action, effectively acting as the agent of Israel in Ireland. It uses excuses, such as <strong><em>the potential </em></strong>of running into EU regulations, to slow down what it can do. By keeping the Occupied Territories Bill open and on the agenda but without action, they can prevent discussion of doing more.</p><p>I&#39;m appalled and ashamed at the Irish government, and believe Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Fine Gael leader Simon Harris to be complicit in Israel&#39;s genocide. Their actions are either cynical or pathetic: either they are deliberately doing nothing despite their rhetoric, or they are unable to do anything.</p><p>Let&#39;s not pretend–we know exactly what Martin and Harris are doing. The blood on their hands is to appease the Americans. This is despite the fact that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/10/mike-huckabee-independent-palestinian-state?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee just admitted that the US was never going to allow a Palestinian State</a>. &#34;There&#39;s no room for it,&#34; he said, &#34;in our lifetime&#34;. You cannot appease the Americans–who you might recall, <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/americas-stamp-is-everywhere-on-bomb-shells-in-gaza-report-finds/?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">provided the bombs that killed 60,000 Palestinians</a>–and also support Palestinian liberation; the two are fundamentally at odds.</p><p>Governments represent their people. What the government does is what Ireland does. When we look at the history books, we will be ashamed at how little Ireland did, and the cause of doing so little falls firmly in the hands of Fine Gael and Fianna Fail.</p><p>However, governments only respond to their people. If the government is not acting, it is because they have been allowed to not act by the people. We know that Irish leaders defer to the Americans, and have for years; it is the people&#39;s responsibility to hold them accountable, and the people have not been doing so.</p><p>That said, <a href="https://www.bigtechfuelsgenocide.com/?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">Big Tech</a> is really where Irish complicity shines.</p><p>Google, Microsoft, and Amazon are providing the <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/gaza-genocide-big-tech/?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">computing for the military campaign behind the genocide</a>, which has among other things completely razed Gaza to the ground.

There should be teams of people outside every single one of those outlets, asking people not to go inside. 3-4 people in a team, round the clock, taking shifts to hand out fliers, teach people about the company&#39;s complicity, and redirect them to local and Palestine-friendly shops instead–it&#39;s not like we&#39;re short of takeaways or petrol stations.</li><li>Scan the contents of every shop and supermarket with <a href="https://www.boycat.io/?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">Boycat</a>, and work with the shops&#39; management teams to change their inventories.</li><li>Practice civil disobedience at the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/VCcH3gWPZECNZJZm7?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">Intel factory in Leixlip</a>, preventing Israeli goods from reaching their factory.</li><li>Protest outside the offices of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/WgvzMhTbvmWzLZG68?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">Google</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/vGYQHqNk6Qdcuqtm8?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">Meta</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/nGHu94GhLj2Kg6FKA?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/LNh6TDYkosL8skmEA?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">Microsoft</a>, HP, and <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/uJPu7CL2L6eaZBbr8?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">Dell</a> offices.

If Ireland isn&#39;t doing all it can to end the genocide and occupation, we&#39;ll never be able to look ourselves in the mirror.</p><p>Start by <a href="https://www.contactyourtd.ie/?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">immediately calling your TD and Senator&#39;s office</a>, and demanding they publicly support and push for getting the Occupied Territories Bill passed this month. Discuss the need for them to go all-out to protect Palestine, and discuss ever step they can take that I&#39;ve listed above. Tell them you can&#39;t vote for them in the future if they don&#39;t go all-out.</p><p>After that, it&#39;s time to get out there: get a handful of friends and either pick a <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/Guide-to-BDS-Boycott?ref=blog.paulbiggar.com">BDS target</a> near you to picket, a shop or supermarket to audit, or if you&#39;re feeling feisty, chain yourselves to the doors of a complicit tech company. Put together a flyer discussing why they are complicit, with a list of alternatives. Include a contact email for your group so new volunteers can get in touch. Voila, you&#39;re off to the races.</p><p>If you&#39;re looking to connect to others to do this work, I can help facilitate: <a href="https://techforpalestine.notion.site/20897bc03cef8071b30dd663ab5b3acf?pvs=105&amp;ref=blog.paulbiggar.com" rel="noreferrer">fill in this form</a> and I&#39;ll connect you to folks looking to do it too (existing groups doing this work, please <a href="mailto:paul@techforpalestine.org" rel="noreferrer">get in touch</a>).</p><p>Saoirse Don Phailistín.</p>
