    <h1>Ask HN: Why is today&#39;s Internet experience so user hostile?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>Ever tried to help a relative over the holidays to set up their home-banking? Lost in the juggling of your multi-factor device garden? Tried to get useful search results from Google recently to find yourself in advert hell? Longing for the old Amazon experience when today&#39;s seems like running the gauntlet of grey-imports and scam-price offerings? Logged out of a site for 6 months and returning to a completely confusing new site where nothing is like it used to be? 
Today&#39;s Internet experience has become user-hostile and it almost calls out for returning to the 90s: walled gardens aka Compuserve experience, dedicated devices for home-banking and standalone cameras.<p>What has led to this experience? On the top of my head I can see the following reasons:</p><p>* Release Often as KPIs for developers</p><p>The release often KPI for promotion and bonuses has led to constant changes to &#39;systems that are working fine&#39; to become ever-changing user experiences. While daily users can gradually phase-in changes, most sites that are casually used will confuse users with completely new error-prone experience.</p><p>* Payment Security and Financial Regulations</p><p>At least in the EU fraud has led to various tech-related regulation calling as an example for separate apps for IDs and for transaction verification. While it is well-meant, it leads people to check bank statements less often and anecdotally in my family confuses especially elderly users to the point of introducing more opportunity for scams and fraud.</p><p>* Patch-work nature of ID &amp; Verification</p><p>Captchas, Two-factor SMS, password rules and Authentication Apps have been patched onto the original user/pass system. The experience has become truly annoying with some clear winners: anecdotally more and more people simply use Google/Facebook OAuth as logins to sites. This is fine from a UI perspective, but lacks consumer regulation - what happens if you lose your access and who can you contact if your accounts get compromised/scammed/blocked?</p><p>* KPI switch from customer first to business model first</p><p>Having gained their audience share, Amazon and Google have switched from a &#39;customer is king&#39; perspective to one which suits their business model most.</p><p>What are other reasons?</p></div></div>
