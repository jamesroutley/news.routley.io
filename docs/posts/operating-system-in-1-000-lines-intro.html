    <h1>Operating System in 1,000 Lines â€“ Intro</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hey there! In this book, we&#39;re going to build a small operating system from scratch, step by step.</p>
<p>You might get intimidated when you hear OS or kernel development, the basic functions of an OS (especially the kernel) are surprisingly simple. Even Linux, which is often cited as a huge open-source software, was only 8,413 lines in version 0.01. Today&#39;s Linux kernel is overwhelmingly large, but it started with a tiny codebase, just like your hobby project.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll implement basic context switching, paging, user mode, a command-line shell, a disk device driver, and file read/write operations in C. Sounds like a lot, however, it&#39;s only 1,000 lines of code!</p>
<p>One thing you should remember is, it&#39;s not easy as it sounds. The tricky part of creating your own OS is debugging. You can&#39;t do <code>printf</code> debugging until you implement it. You&#39;ll need to learn different debugging techniques and skills you&#39;ve never needed in application development. Especially when starting &#34;from scratch&#34;, you&#39;ll encounter challenging parts like boot process and paging. But don&#39;t worry! We&#39;ll also learn &#34;how to debug an OS&#34; too!</p>
<p>The tougher the debugging, the more satisfying it is when it works. Let&#39;s dive into exciting world of OS development!</p>
<ul>
<li>You can download the implementation examples from <a href="https://github.com/nuta/operating-system-in-1000-lines">GitHub</a>.</li>

<li>The prerequisites are familiarity with C language and with UNIX-like environment. If you&#39;ve <code>gcc hello.c &amp;&amp; ./a.out</code>, you&#39;re good to go!</li>
<li>This book was originally written as an appendix of my book <em><a href="https://www.shuwasystem.co.jp/book/9784798068718.html">Design and Implementation of Microkernels</a></em> (written in Japanese).</li>

<p>Happy OS hacking!</p></div></div>
