<p>At Fleet, we believe that a good user experience empowers contributors.</p>
<p>We follow the guiding principles below to secure our company-owned devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our devices should give contributors the freedom to work from anywhere.</li>
<li>To allow maximum freedom in where and how we work, we assume that &#34;Safe&#34; networks do not exist. Contributors should be able to work on a coffee shop&#39;s Wi-Fi as if it were their home or work network.</li>
<li>To limit the impact on user experience, we do not dictate security configurations unless the security benefit is significant; only if it dramatically reduces risk for the company, customers, or open source users.</li>
<li>By using techniques such as Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), code reviews, and more, we can further empower contributors to work comfortably from any location - on any network.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mac-os-devices">macOS devices<a href="#mac-os-devices"></a></h3>
<p>We use configuration profiles to standardize security settings for our Mac devices. We use <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/apple_os" target="_blank">CIS Benchmark for macOS 12</a>, as our configuration baseline, and adapt it to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suit a remote team</li>
<li>Balance the need for productivity and security</li>
<li>Limit the impact on the daily use of our devices</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note: Details of your Mac’s configuration profile can be viewed anytime from the <strong>Profiles</strong> app under <strong>System Preferences</strong>.</em></p>

<p>Our policy, which applies to Fleet owned laptops purchased via Apple&#39;s DEP (Device Enrollment Program), and which will retroactively be applied to every company owned Mac consists of: </p>

<p><em>Note: the setting numbers included in the tables throughout this section are the recommended numbers from the CIS Benchmark for macOS12 document referenced above.</em></p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Keeping software up-to-date helps to improve the resilience of our Mac fleet. Software updates include security updates that fix vulnerabilities that could otherwise be exploited. Browsers, for example, are often exposed to untrusted code, have a significant attack surface, and are frequently attacked.</p>
<p>macOS includes <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/security/sec469d47bd8/web" target="_blank">malware protection tools</a> such as <em>Xprotect</em>, which is antivirus technology based on <a href="https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara" target="_blank">YARA</a>, and MRT (Malware Removal Tool), which is a tool built by Apple to remove common malware from systems that are infected.
By enabling these settings we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the operating system is kept up to date.</li>
<li>Ensure XProtect and MRT are as up to date as possible.</li>
<li>Ensure that Safari is kept up to date. </li>
</ul>
<p>This improves the resilience of our Mac fleet. </p>
<p><strong>User experience impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Updates are required, which can be disruptive. For this reason, we allow the user to <strong>postpone the installation 5 times</strong>.</li>
<li>Critical security updates are automatically downloaded, which could result in bandwidth use on slow or expensive links. For this reason, we limit automatic downloads to critical security updates only, while feature updates, that are typically larger, are downloaded at the time of installation selected by the user.</li>
<li>Enforced updates <strong>do not</strong> include major macOS releases (e.g., 11➡️12). Those updates are tracked and enforced separately, as the impact can be more significant. We require installation of the latest macOS version within 3 months of release, or when known vulnerabilities have remained unpatched on the older version.</li>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Accurate time is important for two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Authentication. Many authentication systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol" target="_blank">Kerberos</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language" target="_blank">SAML</a> require the time between clients and servers to be <a href="http://web.mit.edu/Kerberos/krb5-1.5/krb5-1.5.4/doc/krb5-admin/Clock-Skew.html" target="_blank">close</a>. Keeping accurate time allows those protocols to prevent attacks that would leverage old authentication sessions. </li>
<li>Logging. Performing troubleshooting or incident response is much easier when all the logs involved have close to perfectly synchronized timestamps.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>User experience impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minimal. Inability to set the wrong time. Time zones remain user-configurable.</li>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>This category of settings is special because there are more settings that we do <em>not</em> configure than ones we do.</p>
<p>We follow the CIS benchmark where it makes sense, and in this case, take guidance from <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html" target="_blank">NIST SP800-63B - Digital Identity Guidelines</a>, especially <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#appA" target="_blank">Appendix A -Strength of Memorized Secrets</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We do NOT enforce special complexity beyond requiring letters to be in the password.</li>
</ul>
<p>Length is the most important factor when determining a secure password; while enforcing password expiration, special characters and other restrictive patterns are not as effective as previously believed and provide little benefit at the cost of hurting the user experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>We do NOT enforce extremely long passwords. </li>
</ul>
<p>As we use recent Macs with T2 chips or Apple Silicon, brute-force attacks against the hardware are <a href="https://www.apple.com/mideast/mac/docs/Apple_T2_Security_Chip_Overview.pdf" target="_blank">mitigated</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>We DO require passwords to be a minimum of 8 characters long with letters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we can&#39;t eliminate the risk of passwords being cracked remotely, we require passwords to be a minimum of 8 characters long with letters, a length reasonably hard to crack over the network, and the minimum recommendation by SP800-63B.</p>
<p><strong>User experience impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A password is required to boot and unlock a laptop. Touch ID and Apple Watch unlock are allowed, and we recommend using a longer password combined with TouchID or Apple Watch to reduce password annoyances throughout the day.</li>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any service listening on a port expands the attack surface, especially when working on unsafe networks, to which we assume all laptops are connected.</li>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Using FileVault protects the data on our laptops, including confidential data and session material (browser cookies), SSH keys, and more. Using FileVault ensures a lost laptop is a minor inconvenience and not an incident. We escrow the keys to be sure we can recover the data if needed.</li>
<li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202491" target="_blank">Gatekeeper</a> is a macOS feature that ensures users can safely open software on their Mac. With Gatekeeper enabled, users may execute only trustworthy apps (signed by the software developer and/or checked for malicious software by Apple). This is a useful first line of defense to have.</li>
<li>Using the firewall will ensure that we limit the exposure to our devices, while Stealth mode makes them more difficult to discover. </li>
<li>Firewall logging allows us to troubleshoot and investigate whether the firewall blocks applications or connections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User experience impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Due to FileVault&#39;s encryption process, a password is needed as soon as the laptop is turned on, instead of once it has booted.</li>
<li>No performance impact - macOS encrypts the system drive by default. </li>
<li>With Gatekeeper enabled, unsigned or unnotarized (not checked for malware by Apple) applications require extra steps to execute.</li>
<li>With the firewall enabled, unsigned applications cannot open a firewall port for inbound connections.</li>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fleet contributors are free to work from wherever they choose. If a laptop is lost or forgotten, automatic login exposes sensitive company data and poses a critical security risk. </li>
<li>Password hints can sometimes be easier to guess than the password itself. Since we support contributors remotely via MDM and do not require users to change passwords frequently, we eliminate the need for passwords hints and their associated risk.</li>
<li>Since company laptops are issued primarily for work, and tied to a single contributor&#39;s identity, guest accounts are not permitted.</li>
<li>Automatic logon would defeat the purpose of even requiring passwords to unlock computers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User experience impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Laptops lock after 20 minutes of inactivity. To voluntarily pause this, a <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-mo/guide/mac-help/mchlp3000/mac" target="_blank">hot corner</a> can be configured to disable the screen saver. This is useful if you are, for example, watching an online meeting without moving the mouse and want to be sure the laptop will not lock.</li>
<li>Forgotten passwords can be fixed via MDM, instead of relying on potentially dangerous hints.</li>
<li>Guest accounts are not available.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="i-cloud">iCloud<a href="#i-cloud"></a></h4>
<p>We do not apply ultra restrictive Data Loss Prevention style policies to our devices. Instead, by using our company Google Drive, we ensure that the most critical company data never reaches our laptops, so it can remain secure, while our laptops can remain productive.</p>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limiting ad tracking has privacy benefits, and no downside.</li>
<li>Protecting keyboard entry into Terminal.app could prevent malicious applications or non-malicious but inappropriate applications from receiving passwords.</li>
<li>Library validation ensures that an attacker can&#39;t trick applications into loading a software library in a different location, leaving it open to abuse.</li>
<li>Safari opening files automatically can lead to negative scenarios where files are downloaded and automatically opened in another application. Though the setting relates to files deemed &#34;safe&#34;, it includes PDFs and other file formats where malicious documents exploiting vulnerabilities have been seen before.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User experience impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is minimal to no user experience impact for these settings. However, applications used to create custom keyboard macros will not receive keystrokes when Terminal.app is the active application window.</li>

<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We assume that no network is &#34;safe.&#34; Therefore, DNS queries could be exposed and leak private data. An attacker on the same wireless network could see DNS queries, determine who your employer is, or even intercept them and <a href="https://github.com/iphelix/dnschef" target="_blank">respond with malicious answers</a>. Using DoH protects the DNS queries from eavesdropping and tampering.</li>
<li>We use Cloudflare&#39;s DoH servers with basic malware blocking. No censorship should be applied on these servers, except towards destinations known as malware related.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User experience impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some misconfigured &#34;captive portals&#34;, typically used in hotels and airports, might be unusable with DoH due to how they are configured. This can be worked around by using the hotspot on your phone, and if you really have to use this network for an extended period of time, there are usually workarounds that can be performed to connect to them. Navigating to <a href="http://1.1.1.1" target="_blank">http://1.1.1.1</a> often resolves the issue.</li>
<li>If you are trying to reach a site, and you believe it is being blocked accidentally, please submit it to Cloudflare. This should be extremely rare. If it is not, please let the security team know.</li>
<li>If your ISP&#39;s DNS service goes down, you&#39;ll be able to continue working 😎</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: If you from another organization, reading this to help create your own configuration, remember that implementing DoH in an office environment where other network controls are in place has different downsides than doing it for a remote company. In those cases, <strong>disabling</strong> DoH makes more sense, so network controls can retain visibility. Please evaluate your situation before implementing any of our recommendations at your organization, especially DoH.</em></p>

<li>Ads considered intrusive are blocked.</li>
<li>uBlock Origin is enabled by default, and is 100% configurable, improving security and performance of browsing.</li>
<li>Endpoint Verification is used to make access decisions based on the security posture of the device. For example, an outdated Mac could be prevented access to Google Drive.</li>

<h2 id="google-workspace-security">Google Workspace security<a href="#google-workspace-security"></a></h2>
<p>Google Workspace is our collaboration tool and the source of truth for our user identities.
A Google Workspace account has access to email, calendar, files, and external applications integrated with Google Authentication or SAML.
At the same time, third-party applications installed by users can access the same data.</p>
<p>To reduce the risk of malicious or vulnerable apps being used to steal data, we configure Google Workspace beyond the default settings. Our current configuration balances security and productivity and is a starting point for any organization looking to improve the security of Google Workspace.</p>
<p>As Google frequently adds new features, feel free to submit a PR to edit this file if you discover a new one that we should use!</p>
<h3 id="authentication">Authentication<a href="#authentication"></a></h3>
<p>We cannot overstate the importance of securing authentication, especially in a platform that includes email and is used as a directory to log in to multiple applications.</p>
<h4 id="2-step-verification">2-Step Verification<a href="#2-step-verification"></a></h4>
<p>Google&#39;s name for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) or Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is 2-Step Verification (2-SV). No matter what we call it, it is the most critical feature to protect user accounts on Google Workspace or any other system.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware security keys</strong></p>
<p>We strongly recommend providing users with hardware security keys. <a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/titan_security_key?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Titan Keys</a> from Google are compatible with laptops, iPad Pros, iPhones (NFC), and Android phones (NFC or USB-C). The <a href="https://www.yubico.com/ca/product/yubikey-5c-nfc/" target="_blank">YubiKey 5C NFC</a> is also compatible and includes extra features like support for OpenPGP and additional protocols. It is also possible to use a phone as a <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/9289445?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid" target="_blank">security key</a>.</p>
<p>Specific groups of users, such as privileged user accounts, separate from regular day-to-day accounts, should be configured with a policy that enforces the use of hardware security keys, which prevent credential theft better than other methods of 2FA/2-SV.</p>
<h4 id="passwords2">Passwords<a href="#passwords2"></a></h4>
<p>As we enforce the use of 2-SV, passwords are less critical to the security of our accounts. We base our settings on <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html" target="_blank">NIST 800-63B</a>.</p>
<p>Enforcing 2FA is a much more valuable control than enforcing the expiration of passwords, which usually results in users changing only a small portion of the password and following predictable patterns.</p>

<h4 id="api-access">API Access<a href="#api-access"></a></h4>
<p>Google Workspace makes it easy for users to add tools to their workflows, while having these tools authenticate to their Google applications and data via OAuth. We mark all Google services as <em>restricted</em> but do allow the use of OAuth for simple authentication and the use of less dangerous privileges on Gmail and Drive. We then approve applications that require more privileges on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>This level of security allows users to authenticate to web applications with their Google account. This exposes little information beyond what they would provide in a form to create an account and it protects confidential data while keeping everything managed.</p>

<p>We mark every Google Service as <em>restricted</em> and recommend that anyone using Google Workspace mark at least the following as restricted in <em>Security/API Control/Google Services</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Drive</li>
<li>Gmail</li>
<li>Calendar (Invites include sensitive info such as external participants, attachments, links to meetings, etc.)</li>
<li>Google Workspace Admin</li>
</ul>
<p>When marked as <em>trusted</em> applications that need access to data in our Google Workspace.</p>
<h3 id="rules-and-alerts">Rules and alerts<a href="#rules-and-alerts"></a></h3>
<p>Google provides many useful built-in alerts in <em>Security/Rules</em>. We enable most and tweak their severity levels as needed. When necessary, we visit the <a href="https://admin.google.com/ac/ac" target="_blank">Alert Center</a> to investigate and close alerts.</p>
<p>We have also created the following custom alerts. </p>

<h4 id="email-authentication">Email authentication<a href="#email-authentication"></a></h4>
<p>Email authentication makes it harder for other senders to pretend to be from Fleet. This improves trust in emails from fleetdm.com and makes it more difficult for anyone attempting to impersonate Fleet.</p>
<p>We authenticate email with <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/174124?product_name=UnuFlow&amp;hl=en&amp;visit_id=637806265550953415-394435698&amp;rd=1&amp;src=supportwidget0&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">DKIM</a> and have a <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466580" target="_blank">DMARC</a> policy to define how our outgoing email should be defined.</p>
<p>The DKIM configuration under <em>Apps/Google Workspace/Settings for Gmail/Authenticate Email</em> simply consists of generating the key, publishing it to DNS, then enabling the feature 48 hours later.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466580" target="_blank">DMARC</a> is configured separately, at the DNS level, once DKIM is enforced.</p>
<h4 id="email-security">Email security<a href="#email-security"></a></h4>
<p>Google Workspace includes multiple options in <em>Apps/Google Workspace/Settings for Gmail/Safety</em> that relate to how inbound email is handled.</p>
<p>As email is one of the main vectors used by attackers, we ensure we protect it as much as possible. Attachments are frequently used to send malware. We apply the following settings to block common tactics.</p>

<h2 id="vulnerability-management">Vulnerability management<a href="#vulnerability-management"></a></h2>
<p>At Fleet, we handle software vulnerabilities no matter what their source is.</p>
<p>The process is simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>A person or tool discovers a vulnerability and informs us.</li>
<li>Fleet determines if we must fix this vulnerability, and if not, documents why.</li>
<li>As long as it respects our remediation timelines and enough time remains for implementation and testing, Fleet fixes vulnerabilities in the next scheduled release. Else, Fleet creates a special release to address the vulnerabilities.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="timeline">Timeline<a href="#timeline"></a></h3>
<p>Fleet commits to remediating vulnerabilities on Fleet according to the following:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Severity</th>
<th>Triage</th>
<th>Mitigation</th>
<th>Remediation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Critical+ In-the-wild exploitation</td>
<td>2 business hours</td>
<td>1 business day</td>

</table>
<p>Refer to our commercial SLAs for more information on the definition of &#34;business hours&#34; and
&#34;business days&#34;.</p>
<p>Other resources present in the Fleet repo but not as part of the Fleet product, like our website,
are fixed on a case-by-case scenario depending on the risk.</p>
<h3 id="exceptions-and-extended-timelines">Exceptions and extended timelines<a href="#exceptions-and-extended-timelines"></a></h3>
<p>We may not be able to fix all vulnerabilities or fix them as rapidly as we would like. For example,
a complex vulnerability reported to us that would require redesigning core parts of the Fleet
architecture would not be fixable in 3 business days.</p>
<p>For vulnerabilities reported by researchers: we ask and prefer to perform coordinated disclosure
with the researcher. In some cases, we may take up to 90 days to fix complex issues, in which case
we ask that the vulnerability remains private.</p>
<p>For other vulnerabilities affecting Fleet or code used in Fleet, the Head of Security, CTO and CEO
can accept the risk of patching them according to custom timelines, depending on the risk and
possible temporary mitigations.</p>
<h3 id="mapping-of-cvs-sv-3-scores-to-fleet-severity">Mapping of CVSSv3 scores to Fleet severity<a href="#mapping-of-cvs-sv-3-scores-to-fleet-severity"></a></h3>
<p>Fleet adapts the severity assigned to vulnerabilities when needed.</p>
<p>The features we use in a library, for example, can mean that some vulnerabilities in the library are unexploitable. In other cases, it might make the vulnerability easier to exploit. In those cases, Fleet would first categorize the vulnerability using publicly available information, then lower or increase the severity based on additional context.</p>
<p>When using externally provided CVSSv3 scores, Fleet maps them this way:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>CVSSv3 score</th>
<th>Fleet severity</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0.0</td>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0.1-3.9</td>
<td>Low</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4-6.9</td>
<td>Medium</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7-8.9</td>
<td>High</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9-10</td>
<td>Critical</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Determined on a case by case basis</td>
<td>Critical + in-the-wild-exploitation</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="disclosure">Disclosure<a href="#disclosure"></a></h3>
<p>Researchers who discover vulnerabilities in Fleet can disclose them as per the <a href="https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/policy" target="_blank">Fleet repository security policy</a>.</p>
<p>If Fleet confirms the vulnerability:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fleet&#39;s security team creates a private Github security advisory.</li>
<li>Fleet asks the researcher if they want credit or anonymity. If the researcher wishes to be credited, we invite them to the private advisory on Github.</li>
<li>We request a CVE through Github.</li>
<li>Developers address the issue in a private branch.</li>
<li>As we release the fix, we make the advisory public.</li>
</ol>
<p>Example Fleet vulnerability advisory: <a href="https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/security/advisories/GHSA-ch68-7cf4-35vr" target="_blank">CVE-2022-23600</a></p>
<h3 id="vulnerabilities-in-dependencies">Vulnerabilities in dependencies<a href="#vulnerabilities-in-dependencies"></a></h3>
<p>Fleet remediates vulnerabilities related to vulnerable dependencies, but we do not create security advisories on the Fleet repository unless we believe that the vulnerability could impact Fleet. In some situations where we think it is warranted, we mention the updates in release notes. The best way of knowing what dependencies are required to use Fleet is to look at them directly  <a href="https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/blob/main/package.json" target="_blank">in the repository</a>.</p>
<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/dependabot" target="_blank">Dependabot</a> to create pull requests to update vulnerable dependencies. You can find these PRs by filtering on the <a href="https://github.com/fleetdm/fleet/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aapp%2Fdependabot+" target="_blank"><em>Dependabot</em></a> author in the repository.</p>
<p>We ensure the fixes to vulnerable dependencies are also performed according to our remediation timeline. We fix as many dependencies as possible in a single release.</p>
