    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td>In my experience, HN users tend to have incredibly specialized interests. I&#39;m curious about what newsletters are out there that deliver a depth of specialized knowledge?<p>For me, it doesn&#39;t get better than &#39;The Prepared&#39; and the &#39;Future of Trucks&#39; newsletters.
