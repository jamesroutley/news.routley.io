        <p>Last month, five people had to be rescued after a pod of orcas attacked and sank their sailboat off the coast of Portugal. As the boat took on water, they deployed a life raft and were picked up by a nearby fishing vessel, writes Raffaella Ciccarelli for <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/world/orca-attack-five-rescued-after-killer-whales-attack-and-sink-boat-off-portuguese-coast/d7739372-f0a6-4d33-b09a-ade075700c2e">9News</a>. </p>

<p>Such an encounter would have been almost unheard of more than a few years ago, but since 2020, marine experts have been noticing these odd human-orca interactions along the coasts of Portugal and Spain. The animals have started approaching sailboats, sometimes striking the rudders and even breaking them off.</p>

<p>Conservationists urge the public not to view these incidents as malicious. &#34;They are not attacks, they are interactions, that is, killer whales detect a foreign object that enters their lives and respond to its presence, but not in an aggressive way,” Alfredo López of <a href="https://www.orcaiberica.org/">Iberian Orca</a>, a conservation group, tells <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/orca-attack-so-many-boats-sailors-told-stay-port-1732171"><em>Newsweek</em></a>’s Robyn White.</p>

<p>Orcas—also called killer whales—are actually the largest member of the dolphin family. There are <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/there-no-records-orca-ever-killing-humans-wild-why-1734489">no known deadly orca attacks on humans</a> in the wild, though in captivity, the animals have been known to injure or kill people.</p>

<p>The orca subpopulation living in the waters around the Iberian Peninsula consisted of just 39 individuals in 2011. Three years ago, this group of orcas was <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343685770_Orcinus_orca_Strait_of_Gibraltar_subpopulation_The_IUCN_Red_List_of_Threatened_Species_2019_eT132948040A132949669">declared critically endangered</a>.</p>

<p>It’s unclear why these animals seem to be drawn to the boats, though researchers have a few hypotheses. Perhaps they enjoy the pressure created by a moving propeller, Renaud de Stephanis, president and coordinator at CIRCE Conservación Information and Research, a Spain-based cetacean conservation group, tells <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/20/1117993583/orcas-attacks-spain-portugal-killer-whales">NPR</a>’s Scott Neuman. When the propeller isn’t running, the orcas might get frustrated and break off the rudder. </p>

<p>Or, maybe this is just a new “fad” for juvenile orcas that could go out of fashion as they grow up, Jared Towers, director of Canadian research organization <a href="https://baycetology.org/">Bay Cetology</a>, tells NPR. In the 1990s, scientists observed another strange orca trend, but it has since faded away.</p>

<p>&#34;They&#39;d kill fish and just swim around with this fish on their head,&#34; Towers tells NPR. &#34;We just don&#39;t see that anymore.”</p>

<p>But some researchers say the new trend could pass on to more orcas, creating a risk for both mariners and the endangered whales. </p>

<p>“We cannot discard that more individuals are going to learn this new behavior, interacting with the vessels, and that probably the situation is going to aggravate,” wrote the authors of a paper about these orca encounters in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mms.12947"><em>Marine Mammal Science</em></a> earlier this year. “There is an urgent need to conduct dedicated research that would help better understand the behavior of the animals and implement mitigation measures.” </p>
