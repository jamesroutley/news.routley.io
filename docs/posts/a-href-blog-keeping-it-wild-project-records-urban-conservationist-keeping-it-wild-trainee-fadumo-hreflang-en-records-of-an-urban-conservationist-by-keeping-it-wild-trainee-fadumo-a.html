    <div><p>Fadumo looks back on her discovery of urban conservation across our reserves across London, through photography of habitats, plants, fungi and animals. </p></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  <div itemprop="articleBody">
          <div><p>Throughout our traineeship we’ve visited several London Wildlife Trust reserves. These sights vary in flora, fauna, and land management practices. We’ve learned about what makes a healthy wood, how chalk grasslands are managed and monitored, how to identify an ancient wood; as well as the practical skills needed to maintain these sites like dead hedging, brush cutting and clearing pathways. As a visual learner, I’ve been keeping a photo record of what I’ve seen so that I can remember what I’ve learned and the experiences I’ve had throughout this traineeship. I’ve also learned from my fellow trainees, as well as Woodberry Wetlands Ranger Hadi who took the time to give us tips he’s learned throughout his time doing wildlife photography.     </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>Our first day on a reserve was at Woodberry Wetlands, where we made an Instagram reel on tips for garden bird watching. Woodberry Wetland&#39;s Ranger Andy gave us a tour of the site where we learned about how reeds are cut in a 4 year rotation (1/4 each year) to prevent succession by bramble (as seen in the photo), whilst continuing to provide a habitat for all the awesome wildlife that need the reeds such as reed warblers. Following that, Andy taught us how to use an Austrian scythe, which we practiced on the grass. </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>This was an interesting find on the first day of February. During lockdown I actually painted some snowdrops at home, never having noticed them when I went outdoors. It was lovely to see them out, when so much had yet to bloom. Since spotting them at Camley Street Natural Park, I have been able to identify these flowers on other reserves, and most excitingly on my own estate.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>We found this piece of deadwood at the end of a day of dead hedging. Leaving deadwood on the ground level of the wood is important to encourage diversity in the wood structure and provide food and shelter to many species of fauna and fungi. This encourages biodiversity, which in turn helps habitats to be more stable and resilient.  </p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>We found these flowers whilst removing scrub from the top of the bank. We used Seeker to identify it as we were unfamiliar with it, and were surprised to learn that wild oregano grows in London. Something that we learned while visiting west London reserves with Edwin (Head of Conservation at the Trust) is that Ivy flowers in the autumn and its fruits ripen over winter, providing an important food source for birds over that season. On a rare sunny day in February, I found these berries at Hutchinson’s bank while we were repairing some stairs. </p>

  <div>
          <div><p>During a winter tree ID workshop Toni (Senior Ecologist at the Trust) talked us through how to identify different trees using their buds as well as other properties of trees in Sydenham Hill Wood. In both of these photos, I use perspective as naturally presented by the structure of the trees. </p></div>
      </div>
  
  
  <div>
          <div><p>Towards the end of making this blog, my photography became more focused on close up shots of flowers. This is as a result of a mix of my own personal interest (I love plants!) and the beginning of spring. I tried a variety of different editing styles on the photos below.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>The first photo of blackthorn flowers focuses on the insect crawling over the flower (possibly in search of food). The photo of the daisy (taken at Woodberry Wetlands) is edited to focus on the highlights and shadows. Finally the cherry flower photo is heightened in saturation to highlight the colours in the sun.  I have also edited photos with a vignette to really focus on the contrast of the petals with the centre of the flower. This style of editing was inspired by some of my fellow Trainee Alan’s bird photography. </p>
