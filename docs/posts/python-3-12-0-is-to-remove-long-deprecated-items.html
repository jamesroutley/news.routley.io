          <p>I’m pleased to announce the release of Python 3.12 alpha 2.</p>


<p><strong>This is an early developer preview of Python 3.12</strong>.</p>
<h2>
<a name="major-new-features-of-the-312-series-compared-to-311-1" href="#major-new-features-of-the-312-series-compared-to-311-1"></a>Major new features of the 3.12 series, compared to 3.11</h2>
<p>Python 3.12 is still in development. This release, 3.12.0a2 is the second of seven planned alpha releases.</p>
<p>Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.</p>
<p>During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of the beta phase (2023-05-08) and, if necessary, may be modified or deleted up until the release candidate phase (2023-07-31). Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is <strong>not</strong> recommended for production environments.</p>
<p>Many new features for Python 3.12 are still being planned and written. Among the new major new features and changes so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Even more improved error messages. More exceptions potentially caused by typos now make suggestions to the user.</li>
<li>Support for the Linux <code>perf</code> profiler to report Python function names in traces.</li>
<li>The deprecated <code>wstr</code> and <code>wstr_length</code> members of the C implementation of unicode objects were removed, per <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0623/">PEP 623</a>.</li>
<li>In the <code>unittest</code> module, a number of long deprecated methods and classes were removed. (They had been deprecated since Python 3.1 or 3.2).</li>
<li>The deprecated <code>smtpd</code> and <code>distutils</code> modules have been removed (see <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/">PEP 594</a> and <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0632/">PEP 632</a>. The <code>setuptools</code> package (installed by default in virtualenvs and many other places) continues to provide the <code>distutils</code> module.</li>
<li>A number of other old, broken and deprecated functions, classes and methods have been removed.</li>
<li><small>(Hey, <strong>fellow core developer,</strong> if a feature you find important is missing from this list, <a href="mailto:thomas@python.org">let Thomas know</a>.)</small></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Life, believe, is not a dream</p>
<p>Rapidly, merrily,</p>
<p>What though Death at times steps in</p>
<p>Manfully, fearlessly,</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Life</em>, by Charlotte Brontë, from <em>Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell</em>.</p>
<p>Charlotte wrote about the publishing under pseudonyms by her and her sisters, Emily and Anne, in a preface to Emily’s <em>Wuthering Heights</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Averse to personal publicity, we veiled our own names under those of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell; the ambiguous choice being dictated by a sort of conscientious scruple at assuming Christian names positively masculine, while we did not like to declare ourselves women, because – without at that time suspecting that our mode of writing and thinking was not what is called “feminine” – we had a vague impression that authoresses are liable to be looked on with prejudice; we had noticed how critics sometimes use for their chastisement the weapon of personality, and for their reward, a flattery, which is not true praise.</p>
</blockquote>
