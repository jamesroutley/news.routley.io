    <h1>Jay Powell traded during blackout period; failed to disclose most trade dates</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div><div dir="auto"><p>These are turbulent times not unlike the 1970s. Supply shortages, rampant inflation, domestic upheaval, foreign affairs fiascos. But some inane desire for “continuity” at Fed Chair is not worth sacrificing every principle for which America stands.</p><p>The Biden administration chose to reward corruption at the highest level of government by renominating Jerome H. Powell to Chair of the Federal Reserve Board. Next week, the U.S. Senate wants to rush a vote to bless corruption and confirm Powell in that powerful role. But reinstalling Powell as Fed Chair, after he presided over and is <strong>directly implicated in the biggest government official stock trading scandal ever</strong>, will be a permanent stain on American history — a national disgrace from which our country and its real economy will never recover.</p><p><strong>Fed Chair Powell — who is supposed to serve in the public interest and avoid even the appearance of conflicts — traded millions in personal stocks and bonds while obstructing required public disclosures about those trades for years. Yet, the information that has slipped out is damning. It shows Powell made trades *DURING* the restricted blackout period for pivotal Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings.</strong> <strong>This is a shocking revelation and constitutes grave and inexcusable misconduct by a high-ranking U.S. government official.</strong></p><p><strong>Moreover, Powell directed policy decisions that directly advantaged his personal bond holdings despite longstanding federal conflicts of interest law, 18 U.S.C.</strong> <strong>§ 208. And then he apparently told a brazen lie about it to the press by suggesting the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) said his holdings posed no conflict. FOIA requests confirm that OGE provided no such guidance in writing.</strong></p><p>Set aside the fact Powell presided over the massive Fed trading scandal. His personal actions plainly bar him from serving in any government position of trust, much less the extremely powerful role of Fed Chair. Why hasn’t the media reported any of this?  It seems most financial journalist are some combination of: (1) totally delusional, (2) under gag orders from superiors, or (3) complicit when it comes to systemic corruption at the Federal Reserve and Wall Street. Since mainstream media has failed our country, we are compelled to do what we can to help the cause of smaller outlets like <a href="https://therevolvingdoorproject.org/foia-response-suggests-feds-powell-was-dishonest-about-personal-ethics-signoff/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Revolving Door Project</a> and <a href="https://wallstreetonparade.com/2022/01/bloombergs-craig-torres-shakes-up-the-feds-zombie-press-conference-with-a-gutsy-trading-scandal-question/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Wall Street on Parade</a> in exposing the truth.</p><p><em><strong>Powell Consistently Obstructs Disclosure of Most Trade Dates but Even His Deficient Filings Show Illicit Trades During Restricted Fed Blackout Period</strong></em></p><p>Since being nominated to a seat on the Fed Board in 2012, Powell has been required to publicly disclose the amount ranges and specific dates (“month, day, year”) for personal trade transactions on OGE Form 278e.<a id="footnote-anchor-1" href="#footnote-1" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">1</a> He has materially failed to comply with the required disclosures. Instead of providing specific dates for the majority of his transactions, Powell improperly groups trades of like securities behind the phrase “Multiple” on every OGE form he has filed.</p><p>Ex-Fed Regional Bank President Robert Kaplan — who retired early in disgrace after getting caught trading millions and even trying to time the market with S&amp;P futures — employed the same scheme to obstruct public disclosure of trade dates. Journalists who have pursued long overdue disclosure of trade details have been stonewalled to date.<a id="footnote-anchor-2" href="#footnote-2" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">2</a> Even demands for trading details by sitting members of the Senate Banking Committee that oversees the Fed have been ignored by Chair Powell for months.<a id="footnote-anchor-3" href="#footnote-3" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">3</a></p><p>The limited information we actually have still paints a deeply disturbing picture. For example, take Powell’s disclosure for 2015 - a pivotal year when the Fed was considering policy normalization after the GFC. Powell recorded _57_ separate transaction entries.<a id="footnote-anchor-4" href="#footnote-4" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">4</a> But 34 of the entries obstruct disclosure of dates through use of the “Multiple” artifice. That means Powell must have executed more than NINETY (90) separate trades in just one year, all while sitting on the Fed Board with unfettered access to highly material non-public financial information.</p><p>Worse still, <strong>a significant number of trades were executed during the restricted blackout period leading up to and through the final day of FOMC meetings</strong>. Ironically, when the trading scandal broke, a Fed PR spokesperson touted that Fed officials like Powell are subject to stricter restrictions like no trading during the FOMC blackout period — “10 days ahead of policy meetings through midnight of the final meeting day.”<a id="footnote-anchor-5" href="#footnote-5" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">5</a>  <strong>Yet, Powell</strong> <strong>had at least 6 sales transactions and 1 purchase on April 29, 2015 — the day of the final FOMC meeting.<a id="footnote-anchor-6" href="#footnote-6" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">6</a> He also made 2 purchases on December 11, 2015 — 3 days before the FOMC’s December 15-16, 2015 meetings</strong>. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e204899-3ae0-4f56-b816-7b629e4a5a67_1137x766.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e204899-3ae0-4f56-b816-7b629e4a5a67_1137x766.png" width="1137" height="766" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5e204899-3ae0-4f56-b816-7b629e4a5a67_1137x766.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:766,&#34;width&#34;:1137,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:92339,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50b4516e-54e8-4fa1-b1fe-d6a211eab4b5_1297x422.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50b4516e-54e8-4fa1-b1fe-d6a211eab4b5_1297x422.png" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50b4516e-54e8-4fa1-b1fe-d6a211eab4b5_1297x422.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:null,&#34;width&#34;:null,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:null,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:null,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><p>How do we know Powell wasn’t using “Multiple” to hide disclosure of far more transactions during the restricted blackout period?

For example, despite owning millions in the investment firm’s proprietary equity funds, Powell awarded Wall Street behemoth BlackRock with large no-bid contracts to run trillions in ‘Quantitative Easing’ purchases that have doubled the Fed’s balance sheet to around $9 trillion!<a id="footnote-anchor-18" href="#footnote-18" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">18</a> </p><p>Back in 2020, many industry participants cried foul and rightfully so: “‘It is truly outrageous,’ said one asset management executive, who declined to speak on the record due to BlackRock’s influence on Wall Street. ‘BlackRock will be managing a fund and deciding if they want to use taxpayer money to purchase ETFs they manage. There’s probably another 100-200 managers who could do this, but BlackRock was chosen [in a no-bid contest].’”<a id="footnote-anchor-19" href="#footnote-19" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">19</a> </p><p>And BlackRock decided to do just that - directing the largest Fed purchases into its own proprietary securities funds.<a id="footnote-anchor-20" href="#footnote-20" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">20</a> Jeanna Smialek of the NY Times questioned Powell about the BlackRock arrangement, Powell holding several private calls with BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink, and how potential conflicts of interest were handled.<a id="footnote-anchor-21" href="#footnote-21" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">21</a></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7530fea-ccd4-46e1-9a3d-0a39c03fcad6_792x790.png"><img src="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc7530fea-ccd4-46e1-9a3d-0a39c03fcad6_792x790.png" width="792" height="790" data-attrs="{&#34;src&#34;:&#34;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/c7530fea-ccd4-46e1-9a3d-0a39c03fcad6_792x790.png&#34;,&#34;fullscreen&#34;:null,&#34;imageSize&#34;:null,&#34;height&#34;:790,&#34;width&#34;:792,&#34;resizeWidth&#34;:null,&#34;bytes&#34;:317272,&#34;alt&#34;:null,&#34;title&#34;:null,&#34;type&#34;:&#34;image/png&#34;,&#34;href&#34;:null}" alt=""/></a></figure></div><p>This is yet another serious breach. The BlackRock Invesment Management Agreement of course provides for an ethical wall at Ex. G.<a id="footnote-anchor-22" href="#footnote-22" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">22</a> As it recognizes, “certain BlackRock senior executives may sit atop of the information barrier between the FMA Group and the rest of BlackRock.” One such individual would be CEO Larry Fink. “In virtually all cases, persons who are ‘above the wall’ are precluded from having any involvement in advising the client in connection with the particular transaction.”<a id="footnote-anchor-23" href="#footnote-23" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">23</a>  So “exchanging information” and “checking in” on the arrangement regularly with someone who sits above the ethical wall is very wrong.</p><p>Despite his massive personal financial conflicts, Chair Powell has acted with impunity to advantage the Wall Street firms managing his investment fund holdings both before and after the pandemic. Indeed, in late 2019, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Powell directed the Fed to engage in an unprecedented emergency repo program that provided nearly $20 TRILLION in cumulative loans to Wall Street, including ~$3.7 trillion to Japan’s Nomura Securities and ~$1.4 trillion to Germany’s Deutsche Bank trading arms. Industry experts have opined that the program was in direct violation of the Dodd-Frank Act.<a id="footnote-anchor-24" href="#footnote-24" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">24</a></p><p>The emergency repo program was not broad based, but rather appears to have been directed as aid to “failing financial firms” overly exposed to risky derivatives. Of course, one of the select major recipients of loans was Goldman Sachs at $1.67 trillion. And yes, Powell also owns millions in Goldman Sachs proprietary equity funds.</p><p>To date, there’s been a virtual media blackout on the 2019 repo bailouts, just like on Powell’s trading and disclosure violations.</p><p><em><strong>Middle and Working Class Americans Cannot Afford Four More Years of Fed Chair Powell</strong></em></p><p>What’s the end result of having a Fed Chair as conflicted as Powell? The vast majority of Americans, who own little to no stocks propped up by Fed bailouts and rent or carry a sizable mortgage on their homes, are being destroyed by skyrocketing inflation after shouldering the real burden of a lengthy pandemic. The Bureau of Labor Statistics currently estimates consumer inflation to be 7%. In reality, it’s more than double that.<a id="footnote-anchor-25" href="#footnote-25" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">25</a> And worse still for housing inflation — the most heavily weighted metric which BLS has the gall to suggest is less than 4% year over year. You’d have to be living under a rock to believe that and perhaps that’s all most Americans will be able to afford soon.</p><p>On the other hand, Wall Street and the wealthiest Americans suffered less than a month of down days on the stock market and bask in record wealth inequality. Powell is guided in all his actions not only by his fealty to Wall Street cronies, but also by truly outrageous personal financial conflicts and violations. Powell has tried very hard to cover this up before his confirmation hearing. Sadly, there’s no Woodward and Bernstein of the day to shed light on the truth.</p><p><strong>So the task falls to us ordinary Americans. We need to get the word out far and wide. Please do your part on every social media outlet (Twitter, Reddit, Tik Tok etc.), tell your friends, write and call your Senators, even consider joining a peaceable in-person demonstration to say NO to 4 more years of Jay Powell as Fed Chair!</strong></p></div></div></article></div></div></div>
