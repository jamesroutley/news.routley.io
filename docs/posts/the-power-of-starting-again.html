    <h1>The Power of Starting Again</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div><p>There&#39;s no way around it - forming habits is tough. This is the time of year when many people will vow to make positive changes, and though I&#39;m <a href="https://blog.ericfrisch.com/2021-goals" target="_blank">no fan of New Year&#39;s resolutions</a>, January 1 does feel like a natural reset point. We all know how easily those big, annual goals fall away, though, and it doesn&#39;t help that we constantly get in our own way.</p>
<p>My perfectionist tendencies are well established, so it&#39;s no surprise that I find lists, streaks, and other goal-based metrics helpful in forming and maintaining habits. But there is a definite dark side to this approach. When a day is missed, an item isn&#39;t checked off, or a long-running streak is broken, it can be easy to give up entirely. By focusing on the failure, large or small, good and valuable progress is ignored.</p>
<p>These days, I&#39;m fighting that tendency with two simple words: <em>start again</em>. None of us will ever be perfect, and we can&#39;t go back in time to handle the past differently, no matter how much we want to. But if a thing was worth doing before, it is probably worth starting again, even after some time away or at a reduced frequency. 5 days a week instead of 7, 40 weeks a year instead of 52, picking up a good habit again after days, weeks, or months away - these are much better than letting a good practice die.</p>
<p>During seminary, I began to find value in beginning my morning prayers with a brief period of silent meditation. It&#39;s the kind of positive habit that was beneficial and simple to build into my daily routine... until it wasn&#39;t. I&#39;d oversleep one morning, rush to an early morning appointment the next day, and before I knew it, I&#39;d fallen out of my practice. I&#39;ve continued in fits and starts, frustrated by my inability to keep my streak up. Our metric-based, app-enabled culture doesn&#39;t help with this, and the otherwise excellent <a href="http://www.fascinative.ca/enso.html" target="_blank">Ens<strong>ō</strong></a> timer is always happy to remind me when I miss a day and have to start over. But is meditation only helpful if it happens every single day? Of course not. It&#39;s a good practice, and that&#39;s true as often as I do it.</p>
<p>Last week, I noticed that I&#39;ve completed more than 400 sessions in Ens<strong>ō</strong> since I started using the app. And while there&#39;s nothing wrong with continuing to work towards greater consistency, that&#39;s 400 meaningful experiences I would not have had if I had given up my practice because I didn&#39;t do it every day. Missing a few days or even longer isn&#39;t failing. Refusing to start again is.</p>
<p>Of course, the same principle can be applied to all kinds of habits. And yes, I&#39;m setting some goals for 2023, though not based on daily completion. But when I inevitably suffer a setback, I&#39;ll try not to give up. Instead, I&#39;ll start again. The cumulative result is well worth it.</p>
