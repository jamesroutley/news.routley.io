<p>Polymatt decided he was going to make a 3.5” floppy disk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBiFGhnXsh8">from scratch</a> — and actually did.</p>

<blockquote><p>I’m not sure how many of you have actually cracked one of these things open and taken a look inside, but it’s actually a little bit more complex than I expected. Recreating a shell isn’t going to be the tough part. It’s actually this: recreating the media itself with some PET film and a bunch of chemicals. These disks are incredibly thin, and the magnetic film itself is measured in microns. It’s going to be quite the feat in order to figure out how to apply something that thin.</p></blockquote>

<p>Fantastic. If you enjoyed <a href="https://kottke.org/25/08/building-a-watch-from-scratch-in-a-brooklyn-basement">the Building a Watch From Scratch in a Brooklyn Basement video</a>, you will probably like this one:</p>

<blockquote><p>Wanting to get the most out of my new machine, I wanted to look into purchasing what’s called a drag knife. It’s a tool that would go in where the bit is that would allow you to create very precise cuts on things like paper or film. And after realizing I’d have to pay over $150 for one of these things, I thought, maybe I could make one. So that’s what I did. For me, one of the most satisfying things is using a machine to make more tools or features for that machine.</p></blockquote>

<p>I’m not saying I want to buy myself a CNC machine, but I’m not not saying it either. (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ernie.tedium.co/post/3lw3ic36n3c2l">@ernie.tedium.co</a>)</p>
