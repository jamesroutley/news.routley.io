    <h1>HIV drug could be made for just $40 a year for every patient</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>A new drug described as “the closest we have ever been to an HIV vaccine” could cost $40 (£31) a year for every patient, a thousand times less than its current price, new research suggests.</p><p>Lenacapavir , sold as Sunlenca by US pharmaceutical giant Gilead, currently costs $42,250 for the first year. The company is being urged to make it available at a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-approves-gileads-long-acting-hiv-drug-sunlenca-2022-12-22/" data-link-name="in body link">thousand times less than that price</a> worldwide.</p><p>UNAids said it could “herald a breakthrough for HIV prevention” if the drug was available “rapidly and affordably”.</p><p>Given by injection every six months, lenacapavir can prevent infection and suppress HIV in people who are already infected.</p><p>In a trial, the drug offered 100% protection to more than 5,000 women in South Africa and Uganda, according to <a href="https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/press-room/press-releases/2024/6/gileads-twiceyearly-lenacapavir-demonstrated-100-efficacy-and-superiority-to-daily-truvada-for-hiv-prevention" data-link-name="in body link">results</a> announced by Gilead last month.</p><p>Lenacapavir is currently licensed for treatment, not prevention.</p><p>In a study presented at the 25th <a href="https://www.iasociety.org/" data-link-name="in body link">international Aids conference</a> in Munich on<strong> </strong>Tuesday, experts calculated that the minimum price for mass production of a generic version, based on the costs of lenacapavir’s ingredients and manufacturing, and allowing for 30% profit, was $40 a year , assuming 10 million people used it annually. In the long-term, 60 million people would probably need to take the drug preventatively to lower HIV levels significantly, they said.</p><p>Dr Andrew Hill, of Liverpool University, who led the research, said: “You’ve got an injection somebody could have every six months and not get HIV. That’s as close as we’ve ever been to an HIV vaccine.”</p><p>Most HIV prevention presently relies on daily pills and barrier measures, such as condoms.</p><p>Campaigners want Gilead to allow generic licensing through the UN-backed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/sarah-boseley-global-health/2010/sep/30/aids-drugs" data-link-name="in body link">Medicines Patent Pool</a> in all low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which account for 95% of HIV infections. Similar mechanisms have been in place in the HIV treatment market for decades, where wealthy countries pay higher prices than poorer ones.</p><p>If that did not happen, Hill said, countries should consider issuing compulsory licences allowing generic manufacture in the face of a public health emergency.</p><p>Gilead said it was <a href="https://www.gilead.com/news-and-press/company-statements/access-planning-in-high-incidence-resource-limited-countries-for-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention" data-link-name="in body link">“too early” to price lenacapavir for prevention</a>, as it was awaiting clinical trial data and potential regulatory filings, but promised “a strategy to enable broad, sustainable access globally”.</p><p>This would include both “Gilead supply in the countries where the need is greatest until voluntary licensing partners are able to supply high-quality, low-cost versions of lenacapavir” and a voluntary licensing programme for “high-incidence, resource-limited countries”. Gilead said choosing those countries was ongoing.</p><figure id="b31b3773-1213-44f2-943e-0fd1884e4e42" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:13,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;Most new HIV infections occurred outside sub-Saharan Africa for first time – UN report&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;b31b3773-1213-44f2-943e-0fd1884e4e42&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/article/2024/jul/22/most-new-hiv-infections-occurred-outside-sub-saharan-africa-for-first-time-un-report&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:0,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:0}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-13 | 13" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>But campaigners said it was vital that all LMICs, including “upper middle-income” nations such as Brazil, had access to low-cost generic forms of the drug.</p><p>Similar selections in the past had excluded countries where the HIV epidemic was growing fastest, they said.</p><p>Trials in LMICs made the case for universal access even stronger, Hill said, pointing to the <a href="https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/" data-link-name="in body link">Helsinki Declaration</a> on medical ethics, which said that trials should only be performed in populations who stood to benefit from the results.</p><p>Joyce Ouma, senior programmes officer at Y+ Global, a network of young people living with HIV, said a twice-yearly injectable would be “transformative for young people like me living with or at risk of HIV”.</p><p>Ouma said: “It’s not an exaggeration to say that meeting the 2030 goal of ending new HIV transmissions hinges on Gilead ensuring people in the global south have fair access to lenacapavir.”</p><p>Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAids, said treatment could be “life-saving” by providing a more discreet option than daily tablets for people who faced stigma because of their HIV status or sexuality.</p></div></div></div>
