        <p>What spurred me to redo my website and blog is the fact that I got
        accepted to RC and they encourage us to learn openly. This is something
        that I&#39;ve wanted to do for a long time anyway, so I felt that now is
        the time to get this website up and running.</p>
        <p>Basically, I know nothing (or <strong>very little</strong>) about
        web development, and would like to get up to speed where at least I am
        <em>comfortable</em> adjusting my website. I plan on using emacs to the
        extent possible, and I&#39;ll put the source of how I build the website
        together with the source of the actual notes and static pages + assets
        online at <a href="https://sr.ht/">src.hut</a> and eventually building
        it there.</p>
