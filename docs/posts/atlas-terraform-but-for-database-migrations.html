    <h1>Atlas – Terraform but for Database Migrations</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><section><h2>Define your schemas using the <span>Atlas DDL</span></h2><p>Atlas DDL is a declarative, Terraform-like configuration language designed to capture an organization’s data topology. Currently, it supports defining schemas for SQL databases such as MySQL, Postgres, SQLite and MariaDB.</p></section><section><h2>Visualize your schemas </h2><p>With a single command-line flag, Atlas opens up as a rich user interface to visualize and manage your data topology.</p></section><p><img src="https://atlasgo.io/uploads/atlas-ui-180122.png" alt="ent"/></p></div></div><div><div><section><p>Atlas provides the user with two types of migrations - declarative and versioned.</p></section><section><h2>Declarative Migrations</h2><p>Declarative migrations are migrations in which the user provides the desired state, and Atlas gets your schema there instantly.</p></section><section><div><h2>Versioned Migrations</h2><p>Coming soon</p></div><p>Atlas offers you an alternative workflow, in which migrations are explicitly defined and assigned a version. Atlas can then bring a schema to the desired version by following the migrations between the current version and the specified one.</p></section></div></div></div>
