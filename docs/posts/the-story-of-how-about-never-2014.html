And because questions of legacy naturally engender thoughts of mortality, my preference is to avoid both the question and the thoughts, so I usually deflect them by joking that I’d like my legacy to be not dying.</p><figure></figure><p>But it’s time to reflect rather than deflect.</p><div><div role="presentation" aria-hidden="true"></div></div><p>If the question is what I’d like to be remembered by, well, that’s two things. One is the creation of <a data-offer-url="https://www.cartoonbank.com/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.cartoonbank.com/&#34;}" href="https://www.cartoonbank.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Cartoon Bank</a>, in 1991, which, starting in 1997, archived and made available the cartoons of <em>The New Yorker</em>, while also assuring that cartoonists would be paid when their cartoons where bought and reused. So, do them, me, and yourself a favor and <a data-offer-url="https://www.cartoonbank.com/" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.cartoonbank.com/&#34;}" href="https://www.cartoonbank.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">use it</a>.</p><p>Second is how, with the editor David Remnick’s support, I helped to bring a new generation of cartoonists into the magazine, cartoonists such as Matt Diffee, Alex Gregory, David Sipress, Zach Kanin, Bill Haefeli, Farley Katz, Joe Dator, Kim Warp, Emily Flake, Carolita Johnson, and many others.</p><p>So that’s what I’d <em>like</em> to be remembered for. However, what I <em>will</em> be remembered for is the cartoon that stands as the title for my memoir:</p><figure></figure><p>I drew this cartoon back in 1993, and now the phrase is firmly entrenched in the culture—so much so that it can be referred to as though it were an anonymous aphorisim. Nancy Pelosi did just that during the 2012 election:</p><figure></figure><p>It has been included in “The Yale Book of Quotations”</p><figure></figure></div></div></div></div>
