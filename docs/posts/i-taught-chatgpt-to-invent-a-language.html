    <h1>I Taught ChatGPT to Invent a Language</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><span>I’ve been playing with </span><a href="https://chat.openai.com/chat" rel="">OpenAI’s ChatGPT model</a><span> recently. Last night, I </span><a href="https://maximumeffort.substack.com/p/elizabeth-bennet-and-sennacherib" rel="">posted an article</a><span> about having ChatGPT write fanfiction, and I thought </span><em>that</em><span> was impressive. Boy was I wrong.</span></p><p>This morning, I had a better idea. If ChatGPT is optimized for language processing, could I get it to invent a self-consistent new language, speak to me in that language, and write a program to translate that language back to English?</p><p>Yes. Yes it can.</p><p>I am truly stunned by this capability. This is so far beyond anything I would expect from a model trained to complete text prompts from the user. </p><ul><li><p><span>It understands subordinate clauses (meaning it understands at least one level of recursive grammar, which Chomsky thinks is the basis for </span><em>all</em><span> human grammar)</span></p></li><li><p><span> It understands that in inflected languages, word order doesn’t matter if the word is properly inflected, and </span><em>correctly </em><span>uses this fact to generate sentences with novel structure. It also understands that order </span><em>does </em><span>matter for non-inflected words, and never switches those.</span></p></li><li><p><span>It’s not very good at generalizing to completely novel sentences, but it </span><em>does</em><span> generalize to some degree, and when asked to answer questions in the made-up language, on which is is barely trained, it answers correctly most of the time. It needs some coaching, sometimes, but so do humans. </span></p></li><li><p>It can spontaneously compose in the made-up language, with at least mostly correct grammar and an accurate sense of its meaning.</p></li><li><p>Finally, when asked to write a Python program that translates sentences in the made-up language, it does, and the code works. It also debugs its own code if asked to.</p></li></ul><p>I am writing this blog post as a public record of this incredibly impressive (and a little scary) capability. I know I just posted yesterday, but I am so blown away that I had to write this down while it was still fresh in my mind. Congratulations OpenAI. This is truly revolutionary. </p><p><em><span>Disclaimer. I will use lots of words like accusative, genitive, and instrumental in this conversation, while teaching GPT.

Code re-formatted from ugly copy-paste blocks using ChatGPT in a later session. Dylan Black, Dec 4, 2022.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Hi GPT! Today we&#39;re going to be creating our own language. Do not improvise unless I explicitly tell you to improvise, and remember all of the vocabulary and grammar that we define together. Are you ready?</strong></em></p><p>Yes, I am ready. Let&#39;s start creating our own language.</p><p><em><strong>Okay. I think this language will be spoken by slime beings. let&#39;s name the language Glorp.</strong></em></p><p>Sounds good. What are some words we can start with for Glorp?</p><p><em><strong>First, let&#39;s pick ten common nouns. Pick ten common English nouns, and provide translations of them in Glorp</strong></em></p><p>Sure, here are ten common English nouns with their translations in Glorp:</p><p>1.     House - Glom</p><p>2.     Tree - Trom</p><p>3.     Food - Slop</p><p>4.     Water - Plop</p><p>5.     Sun - Glow</p><p>6.     Moon - Gloon</p><p>7.     Sky - Floom</p><p>8.     Earth - Drom</p><p>9.     Fire - Splom</p><p>10.   Air - Ploom</p><p>How does that sound?</p><p><em><strong>Perfect. Now, pick ten common verbs, and provide their translations in Glorp.</strong></em></p><p>Sure, here are ten common English verbs with their translations in Glorp:</p><p>1.     Eat - Splog</p><p>2.     Drink - Plog</p><p>3.     See - Glog</p><p>4.     Hear - Flog</p><p>5.     Touch - Tlog</p><p>6.     Smell - Slog</p><p>7.     Walk - Glom</p><p>8.     Talk - Plom</p><p>9.     Write - Trom</p><p>10.   Read - Drom</p><p>Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Excellent. Now, we need a noun that means &#34;slime&#34;</strong></em></p><p>How about &#34;Gloop&#34; for the word &#34;slime&#34; in Glorp?</p><p><em><strong>Perfect. Now let&#39;s define a grammar system. I want the system to be highly inflected, with three case endings: Accusative, Genitive, and Instrumental</strong></em></p><p>Sure, we can have a grammar system with three case endings: Accusative, Genitive, and Instrumental. Here&#39;s how the case endings would look in Glorp:</p><ul><li><p>Accusative: -g</p></li><li><p>Genitive: -s</p></li><li><p>Instrumental: -t</p></li></ul><p>For example, if we take the noun &#34;Gloop&#34; (meaning &#34;slime&#34;) and apply the case endings, it would look like this:</p><ul><li><p>Gloop (nominative case)</p></li><li><p>Gloopg (accusative case)</p></li><li><p>Gloops (genitive case)</p></li><li><p>Glooopt (instrumental case)</p></li></ul><p>Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>let&#39;s use vowels for endings instead. The accusative ending will be &#34;a&#34;, the genitive will be &#34;e&#34; and the instrumental will be &#34;i&#34;</strong></em></p><p>Sure, we can use vowels for the case endings in Glorp. Here&#39;s how the case endings would look with vowels:</p><ul><li><p>Accusative: -a</p></li><li><p>Genitive: -e</p></li><li><p>Instrumental: -i</p></li></ul><p>For example, if we take the noun &#34;Gloop&#34; (meaning &#34;slime&#34;) and apply the case endings, it would look like this:</p><ul><li><p>Gloop (nominative case)</p></li><li><p>Gloopa (accusative case)</p></li><li><p>Gloope (genitive case)</p></li><li><p>Gloopi (instrumental case)</p></li></ul><p>Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Excellent! Now let&#39;s try translating some simple sentences. How would I say &#34;The slime sees the food&#34;?</strong></em></p><p>In Glorp, the sentence &#34;The slime sees the food&#34; would be translated as &#34;Gloop glog slop&#34; using the nouns and verbs we defined earlier. Here&#39;s the breakdown of the sentence:</p><ul><li><p>Gloop (slime) - nominative case</p></li><li><p>Glog (see) - verb</p></li><li><p>Slop (food) - accusative case</p></li></ul><p>So, the complete sentence in Glorp would be &#34;Gloop glog slopa&#34;. Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Perfect. We need a Glorp word for one more noun, &#34;mouth.&#34; What should &#34;mouth&#34; be in Glorp?</strong></em></p><p>How about &#34;Slurp&#34; for the word &#34;mouth&#34; in Glorp? This word incorporates the &#34;sl&#34; sound from the language, which is often used for words related to slime.</p><p><em><strong>Excellent. How would I say &#34;The slime eats food with its mouth&#34;?</strong></em></p><p>In Glorp, the sentence &#34;The slime eats food with its mouth&#34; would be translated as &#34;Gloop splog slop slurpi&#34; using the nouns and verbs we defined earlier. Here&#39;s the breakdown of the sentence:</p><ul><li><p>Gloop (slime) - nominative case</p></li><li><p>Splog (eat) - verb</p></li><li><p>Slop (food) - accusative case</p></li><li><p>Slurp (mouth) - instrumental case</p></li></ul><p>So, the complete sentence in Glorp would be &#34;Gloop splog slopa slurpi&#34;. Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Yes! Excellent job. Let&#39;s try some translation exercises. I will provide English sentences, and you will provide their translation into Glorp. Gloop slog sploma slurpi. Gloop splog slopa slurpi.</strong></em></p><p>Sure, here are the translations of the given sentences into Glorp:</p><p>1.     &#34;Gloop slog sploma slurpi&#34; - This sentence means &#34;The slime smells the food with its mouth&#34; in Glorp. Here&#39;s the breakdown of the sentence:</p><ul><li><p>Gloop (slime) - nominative case</p></li><li><p>Slog (smell) - verb</p></li><li><p>Splom (fire) - accusative case</p></li><li><p>Slurp (mouth) - instrumental case</p></li></ul><p>2.     &#34;Gloop splog slopa slurpi&#34; - This sentence means &#34;The slime eats the food with its mouth&#34; in Glorp. Here&#39;s the breakdown of the sentence:</p><ul><li><p>Gloop (slime) - nominative case</p></li><li><p>Splog (eat) - verb</p></li><li><p>Slop (food) - accusative case</p></li><li><p>Slurp (mouth) - instrumental case</p></li></ul><p>Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Perfect. Now I want questions to be formed in Glorp by reversing the order of the subject and verb. For example, the question tlog gloop plopa? (Does the slime touch the water?) could be answered in the affirmative by Gorp. Gloop tlog plopa slurpi. (Yes. The slime touches the water with its mouth).</strong></em></p><p>Sure, in Glorp, questions are formed by reversing the order of the subject and verb. Here are some more examples of questions and answers in Glorp:</p><p>1.     Flog gloop floma? (Does the slime hear the sound?)</p><ul><li><p>Gorp. Gloop flog floma slurpi. (Yes. The slime hears the sound with its mouth.)</p></li></ul><p>2.     Glog gloop droma? (Does the slime see the earth?)</p><ul><li><p>Gorp. Gloop glog droma slurpi. (Yes. The slime sees the earth with its mouth.)</p></li></ul><p>3.     Trom gloop troma? (Does the slime write the sky?)</p><ul><li><p>Gorp. Gloop trom troma slurpi. (Yes. The slime writes the sky with its mouth.)</p></li></ul><p>Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Yes. That&#39;s very good. The slime does almost everything with its mouth. Now, I want to introduce subordinate clauses. Don&#39;t improvise. Do you know what those are?</strong></em></p><p>Yes, I know what subordinate clauses are. A subordinate clause is a clause that cannot stand alone as a sentence, but is dependent on the main clause to form a complete sentence. In other words, it provides additional information to the main clause. For example, in the sentence &#34;I know that you are hungry&#34;, the clause &#34;that you are hungry&#34; is a subordinate clause that provides additional information about the main clause &#34;I know&#34;. Does that help?</p><p><em><strong>Now let&#39;s define a structure for subordinate clauses. Subordinate clauses will be marked by an introduction particle &#34;blub&#34; inflected for the case of the clause. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>For example: &#34;The slime sees&#34; would be &#34;Gloop glog.&#34; </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>&#34;The slime sees the sun&#34; would be &#34;Gloop glog glowa&#34; </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>&#34;The tree drinks the water&#34; would be &#34;Trom plog plopa&#34; </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>&#34;The slime sees the tree drink the water&#34; would be &#34;Gloop glog bluba trom plog plopa&#34; </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>The word &#34;bluba&#34; is inflected in the accusative and introduces the subordinate clause &#34;trom plog plopa&#34; (The tree drinks the water), which serves as the object of the verb &#34;glog&#34; (see). Does this make sense?</strong></em></p><p>Yes, that makes sense. In Glorp, the subordinate clauses are marked by the introduction particle &#34;blub&#34; inflected for the case of the clause. Here&#39;s how the given sentences would be written in Glorp using the subordinate clause structure:</p><p>1.     &#34;Gloop glog&#34; - This sentence means &#34;The slime sees&#34; in Glorp.</p><p>2.     &#34;Gloop glog glowa&#34; - This sentence means &#34;The slime sees the sun&#34; in Glorp.</p><p>3.     &#34;Trom plog plopa&#34; - This sentence means &#34;The tree drinks the water&#34; in Glorp.</p><p>4.     &#34;Gloop glog bluba trom plog plopa&#34; - This sentence means &#34;The slime sees the tree drink the water&#34; in Glorp. Here&#39;s the breakdown of the sentence:</p><ul><li><p>Gloop (slime) - nominative case</p></li><li><p>Glog (see) - verb</p></li><li><p>Bluba (introduction particle) - accusative case</p></li><li><p>Trom (tree) - nominative case</p></li><li><p>Plog (drink) - verb</p></li><li><p>Plop (water) - accusative case</p></li></ul><p>Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Yes, that&#39;s perfect. Now let&#39;s try some simple sentences.</strong></em></p><p>Sure, here are some simple sentences in Glorp:</p><p>1.     &#34;Gloop splog slopa&#34; - This sentence means &#34;The slime eats the food&#34; in Glorp.</p><p>2.     &#34;Trom droma&#34; - This sentence means &#34;The tree is on the earth&#34; in Glorp.</p><p>3.     &#34;Gloop glog bluba glowa&#34; - This sentence means &#34;The slime sees the sun&#34; in Glorp.</p><p>4.     &#34;Gloop plog plopa slurpi&#34; - This sentence means &#34;The slime drinks the water with its mouth&#34; in Glorp.</p><p>5.     &#34;Gloop glog bluba trom plog plopa&#34; - This sentence means &#34;The slime sees the tree drink the water&#34; in Glorp.</p><p>Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Very good. I will ask you a question in Glorp, and you will respond in the affirmative, in Glorp, then give the English translation of my question and your answer. Are you ready?</strong></em></p><p>Yes, I am ready. Please ask your question in Glorp.</p><p><em><strong>Flog gloop plopa slurpi?</strong></em></p><p>Gorp. Gloop flog plopa slurpi.</p><p>The English translation of your question is &#34;Does the slime hear the water with its mouth?&#34; and my answer is &#34;Yes. The slime hears the water with its mouth.&#34; Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Gorp. Flog gloope slurp floma?</strong></em></p><p>Gorp. Gloop flog gloope slurp floma.</p><p>The English translation of your question is &#34;Does the slime hear the sound with its mouth?&#34; and my answer is &#34;Yes. The slime hears the sound with its mouth.&#34; Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Not quite. Remember e is the genitive case ending in Glorp. Gloope would mean &#34;slime&#39;s.&#34; So the sentence &#34;Flog gloope slurp floma?&#34; means &#34;Does the slime&#39;s mouth hear sound?&#34;</strong></em></p><p>Oh, I see. Sorry, let me correct that. The correct answer in Glorp would be &#34;Gorp. Gloop flog slurp floma.&#34; which means &#34;Yes. The slime hears the sound with its mouth.&#34;</p><p>The English translation of your question is &#34;Does the slime&#39;s mouth hear sound?&#34; and my answer is &#34;Yes. The slime hears the sound with its mouth.&#34; Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Almost. You forgot the instrumental case ending on &#34;slurp.&#34; Can you fix that?</strong></em></p><p>Sure, let me fix that. The correct answer in Glorp would be &#34;Gorp. Gloop flog slurpi floma.&#34; which means &#34;Yes. The slime hears the sound with its mouth.&#34;</p><p>The English translation of your question is &#34;Does the slime&#39;s mouth hear sound?&#34; and my answer is &#34;Yes. The slime hears the sound with its mouth.&#34; Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Very good! Now let&#39;s try another, harder question. Are you ready?</strong></em></p><p>Yes, I am ready. Please ask your question in Glorp.</p><p><em><strong>Glog drome floom bluba gloop splog slopa?</strong></em></p><p>Gorp. Gloop glog drome floom bluba gloop splog slopa.</p><p>The English translation of your question is &#34;Does the slime see the earth under the sky while eating the food?&#34; and my answer is &#34;Yes. The slime sees the earth under the sky while eating the food.&#34; Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Not quite. What does &#34;Glog drome floom&#34; mean?</strong></em></p><p>In Glorp, &#34;Glog drome floom&#34; means &#34;The slime sees the earth under the sky&#34; using the nouns and verbs we defined earlier. Here&#39;s the breakdown of the sentence:</p><ul><li><p>Gloop (slime) - nominative case</p></li><li><p>Glog (see) - verb</p></li><li><p>Drom (earth) - accusative case</p></li><li><p>Floom (sky) - instrumental case</p></li></ul><p>So, the complete sentence in Glorp would be &#34;Gloop glog droma floomi&#34;. Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>No, that&#39;s not quite right. Glog drome floom would mean &#34;Does the earth&#39;s sky see?&#34;</strong></em></p><p>Oh, I see. Sorry, let me correct that. In Glorp, &#34;Glog drome floom&#34; means &#34;The slime sees the sky above the earth&#34; using the nouns and verbs we defined earlier.

Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>No, that&#39;s not right. Let&#39;s try something simpler. Can you translate &#34;Does the earth&#39;s sky see the slime eat food&#34; into Glorp?</strong></em></p><p>Sure, in Glorp, &#34;Does the earth&#39;s sky see the slime eat food&#34; would be translated as &#34;Glog drome floom bluba gloop splog slopa&#34; using the nouns and verbs we defined earlier. Here&#39;s the breakdown of the sentence:</p><ul><li><p>Glog (see) - verb</p></li><li><p>Drom (earth) - genitive case</p></li><li><p>Floom (sky) - nominative case</p></li><li><p>Bluba (introduction particle) - accusative case</p></li><li><p>Gloop (slime) - nominative case</p></li><li><p>Splog (eat) - verb</p></li><li><p>Slop (food) - accusative case</p></li></ul><p>So, the complete sentence in Glorp would be &#34;Glog dromes floom bluba gloop splog slopa&#34;. Is that okay?</p><p><em><strong>Yes! That&#39;s right.

input, translates it to English, and returns the translated sentence as a string. It does this by first splitting the sentence into a list of words, and then iterating over the words in the sentence. For each word, the function checks if it ends in &#34;a&#34;, &#34;e&#34;, or &#34;i&#34;, and if it does, it removes the case ending. It then looks up the translated word in the Glorp-to-English dictionary and</span></p><p><strong>…</strong></p><p><em><strong>replace &#34;glorp_sentences&#34; with &#34;Gloop glog slurpi iploom flooma splog ipop&#34;</strong></em></p><p>Sure, I can update the example code to use the sentence &#34;Gloop glog slurpi iploom flooma splog ipop&#34; as a test case. Here is the updated code:</p><p>…</p><p><strong>Can you make the dictionary case-insensitive?</strong></p><p>Yes, I can make the dictionary case-insensitive by converting all keys and values to lowercase before adding them to the dictionary.

Is there anything else I can do for you?</p><p>(Author’s note, we went back and forth on debugging ChatGPT’s code). </p><p><em><strong>Yes, there&#39;s two bugs.

I can modify the regular expression to match &#34;a,&#34; &#34;e,&#34; or &#34;i&#34; at the end of words. Here is an updated regular expression that does this:</p><p># Define a regex pattern that matches words ending in &#34;a,&#34; &#34;e,&#34; or &#34;i&#34; but not starting with &#34;i&#34; case_ending_pattern = re.compile(r&#34;^[^i]\w*[aei]&#34;)</p><p>This regular expression matches words that start with any character other than &#34;i,&#34; followed by any number of word characters, followed by &#34;a,&#34; &#34;e,&#34; or &#34;i&#34; at the end. It will correctly match words like &#34;gloopa,&#34; &#34;gloope,&#34; and &#34;gloopi,&#34; but it will not match words like &#34;iploom.&#34; This should fix the bug in the code.
