	<section><div><h2>Slow Social is a online space built for growing and sustaining friendships
			</h2>
			<h3>How it works</h3>
			<ol><li>Post at most once a week</li>
				<li>Read your friends’ posts once a week</li>
				<li>Chill</li></ol>

				<img src="https://slowsocial.us/img/screenshot_read_post.webp" alt="a screenshot demonstrating what read post page the slow social app looks like"/></p></div>
		<div><h2>Keep people up to date without giving daily play by plays
			</h2>
			<p>Let the memes, hot takes, and transient updates live somewhere else, this is a space where
				friends can share what’s going on in their lives without having to distill it down to bite
				sized information.
			</p></div></section>
	<section><div><h2>The Mission</h2>
			<p>Slow Social was founded to create a space for people who want more connection, not
				attention, when using a social app. While many existing social apps ask “How do we retain
				the users attention?” we ask “How can we help facilitate friendships?”

	<section><h2>How it Works (in detail)
		</h2>
		<ol><li><p>1</p>
					
					<h2>Rich text formatting and no character limit on all posts</h2>
					<p>(because sometimes you want to be <b>bold</b>)</p>
				</li><li><p>2</p>
					
					<h2>Users can write a maximum of one post per week</h2>
					<p>(creates more space for people to write and read)</p>
				</li><li><p>3</p>
					
					<h2>Posts are shared with all of your confirmed friends once published</h2>
					<p>(let the people in your life know what you’ve been up to)</p>
				</li><li><p>4</p>
					
					<h2>New friends don’t see your entire history of posts</h2>
					<p>(let the past be the past)</p>
				</li><li><p>5</p>
					
					<h2>Posts can optionally be shared via email, newsletter style</h2>
					<p>(because we love everyone, whether they’re on slow social or not)</p>
				</li><li><p>6</p>
					
					<h2>Slow Social is privately owned, with a business for good attitude</h2>
