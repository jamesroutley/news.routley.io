    <h1>Einstein-Bohr debate settled once and for all</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>In Steven Pinker’s <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6524">guest post from last week</a>, there’s one bit to which I never replied.  Steve wrote:</p>



<blockquote><p>After all, in many areas Einstein was no Einstein. You [Scott] above all could speak of his not-so-superintelligence in quantum physics…</p></blockquote>



<p>While I can’t speak “above all,” OK, I can speak.  Now that we’re closing in on a century of quantum physics, can we <em>finally</em> adjudicate what Einstein and Bohr were right or wrong about in the 1920s and 1930s?  (Also, how is it still even a thing people argue about?)</p>



<p>The core is this: when confronted with the phenomena of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement">entanglement</a>—including the ability to measure one qubit of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state">EPR pair</a> and thereby collapse the other in a basis of one’s choice (as we’d put it today), as well as the possibility of a whole pile of gunpowder in a coherent superposition of exploding and not exploding (Einstein’s example in a letter to Schrödinger, which the latter then infamously transformed into a cat)—well, there are entire conferences and edited volumes about what Bohr and Einstein said, didn’t say, meant to say or tried to say about these matters, but in cartoon form:</p>



<ul><li>Einstein said that quantum mechanics can’t be the final answer, it has ludicrous implications for reality if you actually take it seriously, the resolution must be that it’s just a statistical approximation to something deeper, and at any rate there’s clearly more to be said.</li><li>Bohr (translated from Ponderousness to English) said that quantum mechanics sure <em>looks like</em> a final answer and not an approximation to anything deeper, there’s not much more to be said, we don’t even <em>know</em> what the implications are for “reality” (if any) so we shouldn’t hyperventilate about it, and mostly we need to change the way we use words and think about our own role as observers.</li></ul>



<p>A century later, do we know anything about these questions that Einstein and Bohr didn’t?  Well, we now know the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem">Bell inequality</a>, the experiments that have demonstrated Bell inequality violation with increasing finality (most recently, in 2015, <a href="https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2464">closing</a> both the detector and the locality loopholes), other constraints on hidden-variable theories (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochen%E2%80%93Specker_theorem">Kochen-Specker</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBR_theorem">PBR</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence">decoherence theory</a>, and the experiments that have <a href="https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/physicists-smash-record-for-wave-particle-duality-462c39db8e7b">manufactured</a> increasingly enormous superpositions (still, for better or worse, not exploding piles of gunpowder or cats!), while also verifying detailed predictions about how such superpositions decohere due to entanglement with the environment rather than some mysterious new law of physics.</p>



<p>So, if we were able to send a single short message back in time to the 1927 Solvay Conference, adjudicating between Einstein and Bohr without getting into any specifics, what should the message say?  Here’s my attempt:</p>



<ul><li>In 2022, quantum mechanics <em>does</em> still seem to be a final answer—not an approximation to anything deeper as Einstein hoped.  And yet, contra Bohr, there <em>was</em> considerably more to say about the matter!  The implications for reality could indeed be described as “ludicrous” from a classical perspective, arguably even <em>more</em> than Einstein realized.  And yet the resolution turns out simply to be that we live in a universe where those implications are true.</li></ul>



<p>OK, here’s the point I want to make.  Even supposing you agree with me (not everyone will) that the above would be a reasonable modern summary to send back in time, <em>it’s still totally unclear how to use it to mark the Einstein vs. Bohr scorecard!</em>  </p>



<p>Indeed, it’s not surprising that partisans have defended every possible scoring, from 100% for Bohr (quantum mechanics vindicated! Bohr called it from the start!), to 100% for Einstein (he put his finger directly on the implications that needed to be understood, against the evil Bohr who tried to shut everyone up about them!  Einstein FTW!).</p>



<p>Personally, I’d give <em>neither</em> of them perfect marks, in part because they not only both missed Bell’s Theorem, but failed even to ask the requisite question (namely: what empirically verifiable tasks can Alice and Bob <em>use entanglement to do</em>, that they couldn’t have done without entanglement?).  But I’d give both of them very high marks for, y’know, still being Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr.</p>



<p>And with that, I’m proud to have said the final word about precisely what Einstein and Bohr got right and wrong about quantum physics.  I’m relieved that no one will ever need to debate that tiresome historical question again … certainly not in the comments section of this post.</p>
