    <h1>Overbite Project: Why still use Gopher? What makes Gopher relevant?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
Most people who &#34;get&#34; Gopher are already using it and instinctively
understand why Gopher is still useful and handy. On the other hand,
people who inhabit the Web generation after
Gopher&#39;s decline only see Gopherspace
as a prototype Web or a historical curiosity, not a world in its own
right -- and more to the point, being only such a &#34;prototype,&#34; there is the
wide belief that Gopher plays no relevant role in today&#39;s Internet and is
therefore
unnecessary. This has led to many regrettable consequences, such as the
neglect of servers and clients, or even active removal of support.
</p><p>
However, there is much to be gained from a heterogeneous network environment
where there are multiple methods of information access, and while the Web will
confidently remain the primary means of Internet information dissemination,
there continues to be a role for Gopher-based resources even in this modern
age. Gopher and the Web can, and should, continue to coexist.
</p><p>
The misconception that the modern renaissance of
Gopherspace is simply a reaction to &#34;Web overload&#34; is unfortunately often
repeated and, while superficially true, demonstrates a distinct lack of
insight.
From a purely interface perspective, there is no question that Gopher could be
entirely &#34;subsumed&#34; under the Web (technical differences to be discussed
presently). Very simple HTML menus and careful
attention to hierarchy would yield an
experience very much like a Gopher menu, and some have done exactly that as a
deliberate protest against the sensory overload of modern Web 2.0.
</p><p>
Gopher, however, is more than a confederated affiliation of networks with
goals of minimalism; rather, Gopher is a mind-set on making structure out of
chaos. On the Web, even if such a group of confederated webmasters existed,
it requires their active and willful participation to maintain such a
hierarchical style and the seamlessness of that joint interface breaks
down abruptly as soon as one leaves
for another page. Within Gopherspace, all Gophers work the same way and all
Gophers organize themselves around similar menus and interface conceits.
It is not only easy and fast to create gopher content in this structured and
organized way, it is <i>mandatory</i> by its nature. Resulting from this
mandate is the ability for users
to navigate every Gopher installation in the same way they
navigated the one they came from, and the next one they will go to. Just like
it had been envisioned by its creators, Gopher takes the strict hierarchical
nature of a file tree or FTP and turns it into a friendlier format that
still gives the fast and predictable responses that they would get by simply
browsing their hard drive. As an important consequence, by divorcing
interface from information, Gopher sites stand and shine on the strength
of their content and not the glitz of their bling.
</p><p>
Furthermore, Gopher represents the ability to bring an interconnected browsing
experience to low-computing-power environments. Rather than the expense of
large hosting power and bandwidth, Gopher uses an inexpensive protocol to
serve and a trivial menuing format to parse, making it cost-effective for both
client and server. Gopher sites can be hosted and downloaded effectively on
bandwidth-constrained networks such as dialup and even low-speed wireless,
and clients require little more than a TCP stack and minimal client software
to navigate them.
In an environment where there are cries for &#34;green computing&#34; and &#34;green
data centres,&#34; along with large-scale media attention on emerging technology
markets in developing nations and the proliferation of wireless technology
with limited CPU and memory, it is hypocritical to this author why an
established protocol such as Gopher would be bypassed for continued reliance
on inefficient programming paradigms and expensive protocols. Indeed, this
sort of network doublethink has wrought large, unwieldy solutions such as WAP,
a dramatic irony, since in the case of many low-power devices such as consumer
mobile phones, the menu format used on them is nearly completely analogous to
what Gopher already offered over a decade earlier. More to the point, few in
that market segment support the breadth of WAP, and those that can simply use
a regular Web browser instead.
</p><p>
Finally, if Web and gopher can coexist in the client&#39;s purview, they can also
exist in the server&#39;s. HTML can be served by both gopher servers and web
servers, or a Gopher menu can be clothed in CSS, translated to HTML, and
given to a web browser (and in its native form to a Gopher client).
This approach yields a natural and highly elegant consequence:
if you don&#39;t want to choose strictly one way or the other
to communicate to your users, choose neither and offer them both a
structured low-bandwidth approach or a higher-bandwidth Web view, built from
the same content. The precedent of a single serving solution offering both to
both clients has been in existence since the early days of the Web with
tools such as GN, and today with more modern implementations such as pygopherd.
Gopher menus are so trivial to parse that they can easily be HTML-ified with
simple scripts and act as the basis for both morphs; what&#39;s more, their
data-oriented approach means they require little work to construct and
maintain, and content creation in general becomes simple and quick with the
interface step already taken care of. Plus, many servers easily generate
dynamic gopher menus with built-in executable support, providing the
interactive nature demanded by many modern applications while still fitting
into Gopher&#39;s hierarchical format, and virtually all modern Gopher servers
can aggregate links to Web content to forge bidirectional connections.
</p><p>
Modern Gopherspace represents the next and greatest way for alternative
information access, and the new generation of Gopher maintainers demonstrate
a marked grassroots desire for a purer way to get to high-quality resources.
Not simply nostalgia for the &#34;way it used to be,&#34; modern Gopherspace is a
distinctly different population than in the mid 1990s when it flourished, yet
one on which modern services can still be found, from news and weather to
search engines, personal pages, &#34;phlogs&#34; and file archives. It would be
remiss to dismissively say Gopher was killed by the Web, when in fact the Web
and Gopher can live in their distinct spheres and each contribute to the other.
With the modern computing emphasis on interoperability, heterogeneity and
economy, Gopher continues to offer much to the modern user, as well
as in terms of content,
accessibility and inexpensiveness. Even now clearly as second fiddle to the
World Wide Web, Gopher still remains relevant.
