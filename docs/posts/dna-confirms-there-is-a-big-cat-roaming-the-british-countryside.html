<p>This is the first time that big cat DNA has been found on a carcass in the UK. The analysis was carried out at a <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/research/archaeobotany/ecological_forensics/cats/">laboratory</a> at the University of Warwick run by Prof Robin Allaby. </p>



<p>Allaby told BBC Wildlife that it was very hard to lift DNA from swabs taken from carcasses but there was no doubt in this case. “It makes me a convert [to the existence of non-native big cats in the UK],” Allaby said. “Until now, I have remained open-minded, I think that’s my job as a scientist.”</p>

</ul>



<p>Allaby has previously identified a bit of a claw that was sent to him from someone who wished to remain anonymous from the north of England as also belong to a cat in the Panthera genus.</p>



<p>Allaby started up the testing service 12 years ago when a <a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/roe-deer-facts">roe deer</a> <a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/roe-deer-facts">carcass</a> that had been scavenged was discovered in a small valley near Stroud in Gloucestershire. “All we found on that one was<a href="https://www.countryfile.com/wildlife/mammals/fox-guide-behaviour-mating-diet-identification"> fox</a> [DNA], which are a really underestimated predator,” Allaby said.</p>



<p>In the most recent case, the <a href="https://www.countryfile.com/wildlife/mammals/native-british-sheep-breeds-and-how-to-recognise-them">sheep</a> carcass was discovered by Cumbrian resident Sharon Larkin-Snowden in an undisclosed upland location. Larkin-Snowden told Rick Minter’s <a href="https://bigcatconversations.com/ep110-panthera-cumbria-dna-developments/">Big Cat Conversations</a> podcast that she chanced across the dead sheep one morning in October last year. </p>



<p>Larkin-Snowden said the carcass was fresh and that she had disturbed whatever had been feeding on, which she then saw running towards a stone wall before disappearing over it.</p>



<p>“I assumed at first it was a <a href="https://www.countryfile.com/animals/pets/the-life-of-a-border-collie-photographer-amy-bateman">sheepdog</a>, but then I did a double take and realised it was a black cat,” she said. “It was big – the size of a German shepherd dog.”</p>



<p>Rick Minter, who has received more than 1,000 reports of people’s encounters with <a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/facts-about-big-cats">big cats</a>, said the animal was most likely to have been a<a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/leopard-facts"> leopard.</a></p>

</ul>



<p>Of the five species in the <em>Panthera</em> genus – <a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/facts-about-lions">lion</a>, leopard, <a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/facts-about-tigers">tiger</a>, <a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/facts-about-jaguars">jaguar </a>and <a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/facts-about-snow-leopards">snow leopard</a> – the only other cat that has a similar melanistic form is the jaguar, and they don’t appear to be in the British countryside, he added.</p>



<p>This news follows the 2022 <a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/news/new-dna-evidence-confirms-presence-of-big-cats-in-the-uk">discovery of strands of black animal hair on a barbwire fence in Gloucestershire apparently belonging to a big cat</a></p>
