In this post, we&#39;ll share:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>The dreaded debate: How engineers stall growth</p></li><li><p>How to move past this wall with the &#34;watershed&#34; framework</p></li><li><p>The impact of investing in decision-making skills</p></li></ul><h2><strong>The dreaded debate: How engineers stall growth</strong></h2><p>We’ve all experienced it: the loathed midnight wakeup call to deal with critical, but often unnecessary, escalations. In the moment, engineers aim for a quick fix to stop the bleeding. But in the morning, they’re eager to find more sustainable solutions with their team.</p><p><strong>These technical discussions often start out benign</strong>. A few engineers get on a call and share their recommended solutions. One person argues their solution is ideal because it&#39;s easy to build and doesn&#39;t introduce more risk. Another counters that they prefer to use a new framework the engineering team has been trying to adopt for this exact use case.</p><p>Tensions mount in these moments. Conversations turn quickly from solution generation to questioning a teammate&#39;s character and skills. The practical can become incredibly personal.</p><p>That&#39;s because engineers are often only trained to think about the execution of technical solutions. Rather than focusing on <em>what and why</em> (what&#39;s the goal, why is this important), they instead myopically focus on <em>how (which solution is better and how can we implement it).</em> Without clarity on <em>what</em> and <em>why</em>, people will naturally start optimizing for things in different directions. The dreaded debate has begun.</p><h3><strong>An overreliance on solutioning </strong></h3><p>It&#39;s natural for engineers to want to move towards solutions. Many of us are trained to identify problems and incentivized to take ownership and fix them. But when engineers are overly solutions-oriented, it&#39;s all too easy to end up in a fiery debate instead of a meaningful discussion about a real core problem.</p><p>Often, what’s presented as the problem (such as getting paged in the middle of the night) is far from the true root of the issue. Maybe the problem is about...</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>a lack of investment in quality reporting</p></li><li><p>how hard it is to get buy-in to start new initiatives</p></li><li><p>stalled innovation happening within the company</p></li><li><p>existing tensions about unsustainable workloads on the engineering team</p></li><li><p>getting paged in the middle of the night</p></li></ul><p>By fast-tracking to ways to resolve the issue, we skip over the two most critical decision-making steps that will impact everything else downstream: articulating the goal and determining the criteria for how a decision should be made. As a result…</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Each person leads with their beliefs and emotions</strong>, and hasty solution-grabbing tends to amplify the voice of those who already have social capital. These situations often benefit the loudest voice in the room, or teammates with other vectors of social power: tenure, race, age, personality, stereotype biases, social relationships with decision-makers, gender, and more. </p></li><li><p><strong>The debate turns personal, ineffective, and overly constrained </strong>as time gets wasted spinning in circles and debating ideal solutions that lack real-world context. Seemingly innocuous, quick decisions compound as a company grows, making it hard for future teammates and leaders to reason about why things are the way they are. Soon, people get frustrated by the lack of progress, or start doubting the skills of others on their team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Careers stall as the work gets unpleasant</strong>. We get bogged down working on teams that can&#39;t effectively ship product because they&#39;re ineffective and slow. Careers suffer and work ends up being highly stressful and unpleasant.</p></li></ul><h3><strong>Lack of alignment affects all stakeholders</strong></h3><p>Ultimately, <strong>when teams overly focus on the <em>how,</em> it&#39;s common that people move in different directions</strong> and nothing progresses forward. People end up exploring different options without a grounded reality on what matters most. This then leaves individuals and teams unable to effectively execute. And this lack of execution ability then makes it hard to have growing levels of impact.</p><h2><strong>Instead, develop decision-making skills by water-shedding</strong></h2><p>Water-shedding is a tool for clarifying your thinking around each step in a decision-making process. First let’s understand watersheds, which are broadly made of three sections.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1640026808337_3442"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1640026808337_17189"><div><h3><strong>Example: Building something from scratch</strong></h3><p>Let’s see it all come together with a real example. </p><p>Zippi&#39;s investments in the early days were big foundational bets to find market fit. One of the biggest decisions Ludmila had to drive was how to architect the core credit card operation to enable flexibility around billing cycles.</p><p>In advance of exploring any solutions, she and her team agreed on the most important criteria for how to build the architecture of the product.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Business impact</strong>: The credit card operation was the core value prop. Any solution needed to establish a unique value asset that was difficult for others to replicate.</p></li><li><p><strong>Opportunity unlocking</strong>: Any solution must make it easier to build customizable features on top of. Architecture overly reliant on third parties would be disqualified if it limited execution against the immediate future vision.</p></li><li><p><strong>Time to develop</strong>: The Zippi team didn&#39;t want to drag the project over a long period or force quick, inefficient timelines.. They determined the solution needed to happen in six months with four engineers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reversibility</strong>: Any investment in architecture needed to be de-risked enough to understand how to reverse the decision.</p></li></ul><p>They then explored several solutions that would fit the bill, such as:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Build everything from scratch</strong>: connect directly with the network and build all the transaction authorization and billing capabilities</p></li><li><p><strong>Connect with a processor that already does authorization and billing</strong>, and have them create a weekly billing cycle</p></li><li><p><strong>Connect with the processor, have them send the authorizations real-time to us, and build the billing in-house</strong> to enable any degree of customization</p></li></ol><blockquote><p><em>We found a processor that was willing to do #3, but the idea of having a system that authorizes real-time was scary to me at that stage. So far in my career, I had never dealt with systems that need to be up 24/7 answering requests in less than 200 ms. I thought about what it meant in terms of needing robust monitoring systems, and on-call engineers reachable at any time of day and day of year.</em></p><p><em>However scary, option #3 would allow us to build an unique engineering asset, and a strategic moat around our product, so we went ahead. 12 months in the operation, and the system is super stable and hardly gives us any head-aches. </em></p><p><em>- Ludmila Pontremolez</em></p></blockquote><p>By <strong>generating multiple solutions</strong> and <strong>recognizing the risks and tradeoffs</strong> with each, her team was able to thoughtfully plan in advance of the decision rather than deal with big fires only as they showed up.</p><blockquote><p><em>This flexibility in the billing cycles, and the ability to customize beyond the initial weekly concept, turned to be a key asset in our company: in a world with more independent workers, more people are living outside of the monthly salary paradigm, so having the freedom to customize billing cycles to match individuals income cadences made our offer even more powerful than initially envisioned. If we had chosen to have a third-party build the weekly system for us, it&#39;s unlikely that they would have been able to quickly accommodate any further iterations. </em></p><p><em>- Ludmila Pontremolez</em></p></blockquote><h2><strong>What you get with better decision-making</strong></h2><p>Thoughtful and thorough decision-making saves you time down the road by investing a little extra time up front. More importantly, your impact as an engineer will be a direct reflection of the quality and scope of your decisions.</p><blockquote><p><em>[Create] a culture where senior people understand the weight of their words and avoid being prescriptive. Instead, help your teammates develop frameworks from decision-making at every opportunity. This may sound silly, but assertive decision-making is a muscle that needs to be stimulated at every opportunity from day 1 in anyone&#39;s career. &#34;What other options have you considered? What risks do you see associated with each of them?&#34; </em></p><p><em>- Ludmila Pontremolez</em></p></blockquote><p>Ultimately, water-shedding helps you develop this muscle by encouraging:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p><strong>Rigorous, defensible thinking.</strong> Often, slowing down to speed up is the most effective way to think through problems.</p></li><li><p><strong>Clarity and confidence.</strong> This process is for you — not your boss, teammate, or anyone else. It develops your own sense of confidence in your thinking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Empathy for others.</strong> Knowing who is impacted by your decisions will lead to fewer enemies and more allies. Moving from vigorous debate to meaningful discussion makes technical conversations feel less personal and more collaborative.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fewer blow ups and surprises.</strong> No decision is without its flaws, but thinking through real implications from a systems-level reduces the chances of late-stage blowups, false tradeoffs, and surprised coworkers whose workflows could be broken by your decision-making.</p></li></ul><p>Curious about more?
