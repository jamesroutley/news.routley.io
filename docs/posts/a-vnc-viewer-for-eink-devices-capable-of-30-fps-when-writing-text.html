    <h1>Show HN: A VNC viewer for eInk devices capable of 30 FPS when writing text</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <h2>A VNC client optimised for eInk displays</h2>

      <p>
        A lightweight CLI (command line interface) tool to view a remote screen
        over VNC, designed to work on eInk screens. For now, you can only view,
        so you&#39;ll have to connect a keyboard to the serving computer, or find
        some other way to interact with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tool has been confirmed to work on the Kobo Libra 2, and should
        work on all Kobo devices. It was optimized for text based workflows
        (document reading and writing), doing that it achieves a framerate of 30
        fps.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>It has only been confirmed to work with TightVNC as the server.</b>
        Due to the unusual pixel format.
      </p>

      <h3>A warning</h3>
      <p>
        The screen can refresh up to 30 times per second, this will degrade the
        eInk display rapidly. Do not use with fast changing content like videos.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, this tool was only tested on a single device (Kobo Libra
        2). <b>It is possible that it will damage yours.</b>
        <i>I cannot be held responsible, use this tool at your own risk.</i>
      </p>

        Sorry, your browser doesn&#39;t support embedded videos.

      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>
        You can use this tool by connecting to the eInk device through SSH, or
        using menu launchers on the device itself.
      </p>
      <p>To connect to a VNC server:</p>
      <pre>./einkvnc [IP_ADDRESS] [PORT] [OPTIONS]
      </pre>
      <p>For example:</p>
      <pre>./einkvnc 192.168.2.1 5902 --password abcdefg123 --contrast 2
      </pre>
      <p>
        For faster framerates, use USB networking (see
        <a href="https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=254214">this thread</a>).
