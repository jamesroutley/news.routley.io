    <h1>Hi, Hello, I’m Back at It</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p><em>*peeks hesitantly around the corner*</em></p>

<p>Hey everyone. Tomorrow, after almost 7 months of <a href="https://kottke.org/22/05/announcement-im-going-to-miss-you-but-i-am-taking-a-sabbatical">a sabbatical break</a>, I’m resuming regular publication of kottke.org. (Actually, I’ve been posting a bit here and there this week already — underpromise &amp; over-deliver, etc.) I’m going to share more about what I’ve been up to (and what I’ve <em>not</em> been up to) in a massive forthcoming post, but for now, know that I’m happy to be back here in the saddle once again. (And that my fiddle leaf fig is doing well!)</p>

<p>I am, however, still dealing with some chronic pain that sometimes makes it difficult for me to work. I’m doing the things I need to do to get better &amp; stronger, but just be aware that it might affect my output here. It’s a very frustrating situation — in many ways, I’m in the best physical shape of my life and am excited to be back here but this more-or-less constant background pain is a real source of friction as I go about my day. Just wanted to get that out there — thanks for your continued patience.</p>

<p>Ok, here we go!</p>
