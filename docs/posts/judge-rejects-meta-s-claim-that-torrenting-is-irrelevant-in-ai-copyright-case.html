    <h1>Judge rejects Meta&#39;s claim that torrenting is “irrelevant” in AI copyright case</h1>

<p>It could certainly look worse for Meta if authors manage to present evidence supporting the second way that torrenting could be relevant to the case, Chhabaria suggested.</p>
<p>&#34;Meta downloading copyrighted material from shadow libraries&#34; would also be relevant to the character of the use, &#34;if it benefitted those who created the libraries and thus supported and perpetuated their unauthorized copying and distribution of copyrighted works,&#34; Chhabria wrote.</p>
<p>Counting potential strikes against Meta, Chhabria pointed out that the &#34;vast majority of cases&#34; involving &#34;this sort of peer-to-peer file-sharing&#34; are found to &#34;constitute copyright infringement.&#34; And it likely doesn&#39;t help Meta&#39;s case that &#34;some of the libraries Meta used have themselves been found liable for infringement.&#34;</p>
<p>However, Meta may overcome this argument, too, since book authors &#34;have not submitted any evidence&#34; that potentially shows how Meta&#39;s downloading may perhaps be &#34;propping up&#34; or financially benefiting pirate libraries.</p>
<p>Finally, Chhabria noted that the &#34;last issue relating to the character of Meta’s use&#34; of books in regards to its torrenting is &#34;the relationship between Meta’s downloading of the plaintiffs’ books and Meta’s use of the books to train Llama.&#34;</p>
<p>Authors had tried to argue that these elements were distinct. But Chhabria said there&#39;s no separating the fact that Meta downloaded the books to serve the &#34;highly transformative&#34; purpose of training Llama.</p>
<p>&#34;Because Meta’s ultimate use of the plaintiffs’ books was transformative, so too was Meta’s downloading of those books,&#34; Chhabria wrote.</p>

<h2>AI training rulings may get more authors paid</h2>
<p>Authors only learned of Meta&#39;s torrenting through discovery in the lawsuit, and because of that, Chhabria noted that &#34;the record on Meta’s alleged distribution is incomplete.&#34;</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible that authors may be able to show evidence that Meta &#34;contributed to the BitTorrent network&#34; by providing significant computing power that could&#39;ve meaningfully assisted shadow libraries, Chhabria said in a footnote.</p>
