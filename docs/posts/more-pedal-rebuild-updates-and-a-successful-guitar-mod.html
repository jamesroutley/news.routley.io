              <p>Welp. The good news is I finished <a href="https://slinkp.com/danelectro-59xt-mods/" rel="nofollow">upgrading my danelectro 59XT guitar</a> and
it sounds amazing.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://slinkp.com/canarat/" rel="nofollow">canarat</a> is assembled in its new housing ... and not working.</p>
<p>As for <a href="https://slinkp.com/guitar-pedal-builds/" rel="nofollow">the others</a>: The compressor is
assembled in its new housing, with its new charge pump ... and not working.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not started on the Foxx clone - that was going to be the hard one!
I&#39;m determined to get these all done, darn it.
That is all for now.</p>
