    <h1>OS 9 has no shell</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Mac OS X is only partially related to its predecessors - large parts of OS X were imported from Apple’s acquisition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP">NeXTSTEP</a>, which had a different kernel and design from Mac OS 9.
This is significant enough that applications made for one don’t run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_built-in_macOS_apps#Classic">natively*</a> in the other.</p>

<p>Recently, I got a 2001 iMac which was dual booting OS 9 and OS X.</p>

<p>There was a little problem - I didn’t know the admin password on the OS X install.</p>

<p>I thought that maybe I could reset it from inside OS 9 - in an OS with less concept of user permissions, maybe I would be able to pop open some kind of terminal with admin rights and run a password reset command.</p>

<p><img src="https://metavee.github.io/blog/images/os9_shell/os9_control_panels.png" alt="iMac G3"/></p>

<p>But not only is there no password reset command, there is actually no shell at all.</p>

<p>What???</p>

<p>I had this feeling that I should have known better, but this honestly surprised me a lot - it didn’t occur to me that anyone would build an OS without a shell.
Even Windows has a shell!</p>

<p>Here’s one weird related fact - there is no standard output stream on OS 9 either.
This is even stranger to me - do you need to write GUI code just to make a standalone hello world program?</p>

<p>Funnily enough, this would have seemed totally reasonable to me when I was a kid - I thought CLIs were a thing of the past and not essential any more.
Now that I’ve been programming for a long time, I’ve come to expect stdout (or something analogous) to exist in every environment.</p>

<p>In spite of (or perhaps because of) taking stdout for granted, I only have a hazy understanding of what stdout is/where it “lives”.
Nevertheless, it is disorienting for it to simply <em>not be there</em>.</p>
