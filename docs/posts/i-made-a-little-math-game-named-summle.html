    <div><div><p>January was a mild and dry month. Birds had little reason to move far and consequently, it was a very quiet time for birds here. </p></div></div>
  </div>
</div>
<div>  
  <div>
          <div><p>Eight duck species were on view here in January. As well as the four breeding species, we had a regular male<strong> shelduck</strong> which was seen on and off all month, and two male <strong>red-crested pochards (above)</strong> visited on the 16<sup>th</sup>. <strong>Teal</strong> and <strong>shoveler </strong>were seen all month, with around ten of each being the peak.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>An unusual feature of the month was a flock of around 25 pochards which were seen here frequently and included up to four hybrid ducks. They included a <strong>mallard x pochard hybrid (above)</strong> which had been seen here in December, as well as a few <strong>pochard x tufted duck (below)</strong>.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>There were a few periods of low water levels through the month, and this was usually the time to see <strong>snipe</strong>, with a peak count of seven being seen. <strong>Water rail</strong> numbers are probably lower than usual this year but there were occasional sightings, and the first <strong>little egret</strong> of the year was seen on the 30<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>Overwintering warblers would have been fairly scarce going back as little as ten years but now three warbler species can readily be seen here. <strong>Cettiâ€™s</strong> <strong>warblers </strong>are non-migratory so are ever-present but we also have a few each of <strong>chiffchaff </strong>and <strong>blackcap</strong> overwintering here. All three of these warblers have been heard singing already.</p>
<p>The total number of bird species seen here in January 2022 was 56. This is the same total as the equally mild January 2021 and is in stark contrast to years with some more extreme weather, such as 2017 and 2018, which both saw 64 species recorded here in January.</p>
