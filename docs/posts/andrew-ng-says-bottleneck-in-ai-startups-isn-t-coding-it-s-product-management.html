                <p>AI has made coding the easy part. The hard part now is product management, said Andrew Ng.</p><p>The Stanford professor and former Google Brain scientist said on an episode of the &#34;No Priors&#34; podcast published Thursday that <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-ng-vibe-coding-unfortunate-term-exhausting-job-2025-6" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">AI-assisted coding</a> has compressed the startup loop.</p><p>Things that used to take six engineers three months to build, &#34;my friends and I, we&#39;ll just build on a weekend,&#34; Ng said.</p><p>&#34;The bottleneck is deciding what do we actually want to build,&#34; he added.</p><p>In the past, a prototype might take three weeks to develop, so waiting another week for user feedback wasn&#39;t a big deal. But today, when a prototype can be built in a single day, &#34;if you have to wait a week for user feedback, that&#39;s really painful,&#34; Ng said.</p><p>That mismatch is forcing teams to make faster product decisions — and Ng said his teams are &#34;increasingly relying on gut.&#34;</p><p>The best product managers bring &#34;deep customer empathy,&#34; he said. It&#39;s not enough to crunch data on user behavior. They need to form a mental model of the ideal customer.</p><p>It&#39;s the ability to &#34;synthesize lots of signals to really put yourself in the other person&#39;s shoes to then very rapidly make product decisions,&#34; he added.</p><p>Ng did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.</p><h2 id="ddc8a22d-aaac-41d7-9310-ddfb0ac3e3c4" data-toc-id="ddc8a22d-aaac-41d7-9310-ddfb0ac3e3c4">The great product manager debate</h2><p>Ng&#39;s comments come as the debate continues in the startup world over the role of product managers.</p>
              
              
              
            <p>Product managers have been referred to — both affectionately and critically — as &#34;mini-CEOs&#34; of the products they oversee. They act as a bridge among engineers, sales teams, customer service, and other departments, ensuring that products align with user needs.</p><p>Some tech leaders have said that product managers are key in the age of AI.</p><p>Microsoft&#39;s chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, said on an episode of the &#34;Twenty Minute VC&#34; podcast published in March that <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/product-managers-train-ai-agents-microsoft-chief-technology-officer-scott-2025-4" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">product managers play</a> a crucial role in setting up &#34;feedback loops&#34; to make AI agents better.</p><p>But others argue that <a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/product-managers-rule-silicon-valley-tech-industry-programmers-jobs-ceo-2024-11" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">product managers add little value</a>.</p><p>Surge AI CEO Edwin Chen said on an episode of the &#34;No Priors&#34; podcast published last month that product managers don&#39;t make sense early on in a company&#39;s early days.</p><p><a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-performance-management-low-performers-country-club-2025-2" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">Microsoft</a> wants to increase the number of engineers relative to product or program managers, Business Insider&#39;s Ashley Stewart reported in March.</p><p>The call for executives to go &#34;<a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-everyone-in-tech-talking-founder-mode-paul-graham-chesky-2024-9" data-track-click="{&#34;element_name&#34;:&#34;body_link&#34;,&#34;event&#34;:&#34;tout_click&#34;,&#34;index&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;,&#34;product_field&#34;:&#34;bi_value_unassigned&#34;}" rel="">founder mode</a>&#34; — a concept coined by the Y Combinator cofounder Paul Graham and touted by Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky — has some leaders questioning whether they should delegate product decisions to product managers.</p><p>In 2023, Chesky merged product management with marketing, and Snap told The Information in the same year that it laid off 20 product managers to help speed up the company&#39;s decision-making.</p>
