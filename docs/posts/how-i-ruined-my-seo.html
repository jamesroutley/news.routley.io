    <h1>How I ruined my SEO</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In October 2022 traffic to my blog dropped like a stone. What happened? Somehow I ruined my SEO. Don&#39;t be me. I&#39;ll tell you what I got up to and hopefully you can avoid doing the same.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="title image reading &amp;quot;How I ruined my SEO&amp;quot; with an image of a tire fire in the background" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/priou/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/https://johnnyreilly.com/assets/images/title-image-1e3ac833283e88bed622002df4a9e229.png" width="800" height="450"/></p><h2 id="what-i-did-on-my-holidays">What I did on my holidays<a href="#what-i-did-on-my-holidays" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Naturally I blame all of this on a holiday to the British seaside. I was away for a week, and whilst I was away I did not have access to a laptop. This is intentional by the way; I spend too much time on computers one way or another. I force myself to disconnect on holidays. But whilst I didn&#39;t have the ability to program, I had the ability to ponder.</p><p>I found myself going down a rabbit hole on SEO. I&#39;d never really thought about it previously, and I thought &#34;what would happen if I made some tweaks?&#34; My expectation was that I&#39;d slightly improve my SEO. Probably not by much, but I&#39;d learn something and it&#39;d be fun. What actually happened was that in October 2022 (after my fiddling), traffic from search engines more or less dried up. Not quite the plan.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot of google analytics demonstrating traffic rapidly tailing off" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/priou/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/https://johnnyreilly.com/assets/images/screenshot-google-analytics-d5b72ebc10073b0adaf87160e2093585.png" width="2443" height="1063"/></p><p>Odds are, the was probably because of my actions. I&#39;m not sure what I did wrong, but I&#39;m going to share what I did and maybe you can tell me where I pulled the pin out of the hand grenade.</p><p>Frustratingly, the feedback loop on SEO is anything but tight. You make a change, and then weeks (or months) later you see the results. And by then you&#39;ve forgotten what you did. So I&#39;m going to try and document what I did and what I think I did wrong.</p><p>Incidentally, I&#39;m hoping someone will read this and tell me what I did wrong. I did something. I assume I did something. Come with me and embrace your inner Sherlock. I&#39;m going to share evidence and maybe you can draw some conclusions.</p><p>So what did I get up to? In the time before my traffic fell off a cliff I did all kinds of things. Let&#39;s begin.</p><h2 id="upgraded-to-docusaurus-22">Upgraded to Docusaurus 2.2<a href="#upgraded-to-docusaurus-22" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>My blog runs on Docusaurus. I upgraded from 2.1 to 2.2. I can&#39;t see why that would be an issue. I don&#39;t think it is.</p><h2 id="added-fontaine">Added fontaine<a href="#added-fontaine" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/johnnyreilly/blog.johnnyreilly.com/pull/305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I started using fontaine on my blog</a>. If you haven&#39;t tried it out, <a href="https://github.com/danielroe/fontaine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can find it here</a>. It helps reduce Cumulative Layout Shift. The flash of unstyled content jank that you can see when you first land on a site, before fonts have loaded. I can&#39;t see why that would be an issue. It should improve my blogs Core Web Vitals and help stuff rank better, not worse. I think this is a red herring.</p><h2 id="google-analytics---sharing-my-g-tag-with-the-docusaurus-docs">Google Analytics - sharing my g-tag with the Docusaurus docs<a href="#google-analytics---sharing-my-g-tag-with-the-docusaurus-docs" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Here&#39;s where I suspect we may have a candidate. I did a foolish thing. You may be aware that Google are sunsetting Google Analytics as was, in favour of Google Analytics 4. I was using Google Analytics to track my blog traffic and thought &#34;oh well I best migrate then&#34;.</p><p>Migration involved using in a new plugin for Docusaurus. However, the docs weren&#39;t great. I managed to work out how to get it working, and I thought I&#39;d help the community by <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/7252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submitting a docs PR</a>. Can you see where this is going?</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot showing me submitting my actual GA4 tag" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/priou/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/https://johnnyreilly.com/assets/images/screenshot-docusaurus-g-tag-6febc3ec0a9593c70f1ae5f1bfa6db53.png" width="2963" height="468"/></p><p>Yup. I managed to land my GA4 tag in the actual Docusaurus docs... I know, I know. I&#39;m a mug. You might be wondering how I found out. Well the real giveaway was that I&#39;ve never written any blogposts in Chinese.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of search console insights with traffic from Chinese websites" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/priou/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/https://johnnyreilly.com/assets/images/screenshot-search-console-insights-43382286fa41f34d6f4e95f748714fdd.webp" width="1134" height="1396"/></p><p>I started seeing unfamiliar entries in my search traffic. I couldn&#39;t work out what was going on. It didn&#39;t make sense. Then I remembered my PR and the terrible truth became apparent:</p><blockquote><p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a developer in possession of a good keyboard, must <strong>copy and paste</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Nightmare. Other people were using my GA4 tag.</p><p>I did try to roll this back; search GitHub for my tag and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/8313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submit PRs to remove it</a>. But not every PR was merged. In the end I gave up and created a new GA4 property and started again. Out there right now, there are still websites sending my old GA4 tag traffic to Google. What a horlicks.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if Google tracks for sites sharing analytics tags and deranks them as a consequence, but I suspect it&#39;s a possibility. Who knows? (Maybe you do? Tell me!)</p><h2 id="googles-new-spam-update">Googles new spam update<a href="#googles-new-spam-update" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>When I started to see traffic tail off, I started to look around for clues. It turns out there&#39;s a subculture of SEO tools out there. I&#39;m not sure how I missed them before. I found <a href="https://ahrefs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ahrefs</a> and <a href="https://semrush.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">semrush</a>; others too. This graph from ahrefs caught my eye:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot of ahrefs demonstrating traffic rapidly tailing off aligned with google spam update" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/priou/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/https://johnnyreilly.com/assets/images/screenshot-ahrefs-spam-update-af7a8bd795f5f80ee5ed9b91a52e63bc.webp" width="1746" height="1232"/></p><p>You can see everything going South for me in October. What you can also see are Google search updates on the X axis. It turns out Google regularly update their search algorithm. <a href="https://ahrefs.com/google-algorithm-updates#october-2022-spam-update-2022-10-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interestingly, one of their updates coincides with my traffic tailing off</a>.</p><blockquote><h3 id="october-2022-spam-update">October 2022 Spam Update<a href="#october-2022-spam-update" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Spam updates target sites that don&#39;t follow the webmaster guidelines. Sites impacted by these updates may be seeking short term gains while ignoring best practices. This update was completed on October 21st.</p><p><a href="https://developers.google.com/search/updates/spam-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Search spam updates and your site ↗</a></p></blockquote><p>&#34;Bingo!&#34; I thought. &#34;This is it!&#34; But as I dug through the details, I became doubtful. Nothing on my site looks spammy. In my opinion obviously. But try as I might, I couldn&#39;t see it any other way. My content isn&#39;t spammy. Unless I&#39;m missing something? Am I?</p><h2 id="from-png-to-webp-and-back-again">From PNG to WebP and back again<a href="#from-png-to-webp-and-back-again" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Most of the images on my blog were PNGs. Lighthouse would regularly suggest migrating to a newer image format. I read around and the suggestion generally was that WebP was the way to go. So I did. But I think I made a bit of a mistake. As the images were converted, their filenames changed.</p><p>Because I didn&#39;t think it mattered, I didn&#39;t implement redirects. My view was &#34;the blog posts have references to the new image names - that&#39;s likely all that matters&#34;. I&#39;d lay money that&#39;s a mistake; that I should have implemented redirects and the site is being penalised.</p><p>Again, do tell me if I&#39;m running with a false assumption here.</p><p>Oh the &#34;and back again&#34;. I make use of <a href="https://johnnyreilly.com/2021/12/12/open-graph-sharing-previews-guide">Open Graph sharing previews on my blog</a> - so people using my links on social media get a nice preview of the content. <a href="https://www.stevefenton.co.uk/blog/2022/10/webp-opengraph-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I learned from Steve Fenton that open graph doesn&#39;t always support WebP</a>. Which sucks.</p><p>So I decided to revert my Open Graph images back to being PNGs; with entirely different names. Again I didn&#39;t implement redirects - no wonder Google loves me!</p><h2 id="backlinks--referring-domains">Backlinks / referring domains<a href="#backlinks--referring-domains" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As I did my deepdive into SEO, I learned that backlinks and referring domains are important. I had a lot of them; I&#39;ve been blogging for a long time. However, I suspect I had rather scorched the earth by failing to implement redirects. This chart from ahrefs shows the impact:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="screenshot of an ahrefs graph showing a drop off in the number of referring domains around mid 2022" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/priou/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/https://johnnyreilly.com/assets/images/screenshot-referring-domains-fc1f2a38cb17f4adf911dacbabfd705d.webp" width="1440" height="556"/></p><p>My assumption here is that by failing to implement redirects, I&#39;ve lost a lot of backlinks. Previous 200s had transitioned to be 404s and Google had noticed.</p><p>I mentioned that I&#39;ve been blogging a long time. Consequently I have a lot of blog posts. I also have <a href="https://johnnyreilly.com/atom.xml">Atom</a> / <a href="https://johnnyreilly.com/rss.xml">RSS</a> feeds on my blog. I didn&#39;t realise that there are limits on the size of these feeds. It doesn&#39;t appear to be standardised; but when I took a look at my feeds in various feed readers, I found they were erroring due to the size of the feeds.</p><p>I decided to start truncating the number of entries in my feeds. It&#39;s not so hard to do, just a post build step which <a href="https://johnnyreilly.com/2022/11/22/xml-read-and-write-with-node-js">reads, amends and writes the XML</a>.</p><p>With this in place RSS readers seemed to be happier. And given a number of publications read my RSS feeds, it&#39;s likely that this will increase my backlinks over time.</p><p>I also contributed a <a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/8378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PR to Docusaurus</a> that will allow everyone to configure and adjust the number of entries in their feeds directly through Docusaurus; as opposed to afterwards in a post build step.</p><h2 id="dynamic-redirects---too-little-too-late">Dynamic redirects - too little too late?<a href="#dynamic-redirects---too-little-too-late" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As I&#39;ve mentioned, I broke links by not implementing redirects. It might be closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, but I decided to go back and implement redirects. In December 2022 <a href="https://johnnyreilly.com/2022/12/22/azure-static-web-apps-dynamic-redirects-azure-functions">I implemented dynamic redirects on my blog using Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Functions</a>.</p><p>I implemented redirects for:</p><ul><li>images</li><li>blog posts (from my old Blogger URLs to my new Docusaurus URLs)</li><li>RSS / Atom feeds (Blogger had both of these but at different endpoints)</li><li>renamed blog posts (I renamed a number of blog posts over time to be more SEO friendly)</li></ul><p>I also decided to do some research. <a href="https://johnnyreilly.com/2023/01/01/application-insights-bicep-azure-static-web-apps">I plugged Application Insights into my blog</a> and started logging out when redirects were being hit. I also started logging out when 404s were being hit. I wanted to see if I was missing anything. I&#39;ve been checking the logs every day since, and adding new redirects as I go.</p><p>Will this help over time? Answers on a postcard please. Or toot / tweet / email / DM me.</p><p>As an aside, looking at the logs in itself has been a lesson:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="many redirects from Wordpress URLs" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/priou/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto/https://johnnyreilly.com/assets/images/screenshot-application-insights-404-74d01b8261d32e20db3949856e0c3ee2.webp" width="3004" height="1368"/></p><p>Someone on the internet is <em>always</em> trying to hack you. And usually under the assumption you&#39;re running WordPress / PHP.</p><h2 id="help-me-obi-wan-youre-my-only-hope">Help me Obi-Wan, you&#39;re my only hope<a href="#help-me-obi-wan-youre-my-only-hope" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>As you can see, I&#39;ve done a lot of tinkering. I&#39;m not quite sure what torched my SEO. It may be one thing, it may be a combination of things. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a road back.</p><p>I&#39;m hoping someone will read this and tell me what I did wrong. I did something. Or at least I assume I&#39;m the cause. Maybe I&#39;m not? Maybe I&#39;m missing something entirely. If you know, please let me know.
