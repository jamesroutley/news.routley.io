    <h1>One of Britain&#39;s largest stocks of second-hand books ever amassed</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>One of Britain’s largest stocks of <a href="https://www.worldofinteriors.com/culture/aesthetes-library">second-hand books</a> ever amassed can be found in the unlikeliest of locations: a vast former youth hostel in a pretty corner of the Yorkshire Dales. Meticulously sorted into subject areas, from naval history to 19th-century literature, architecture to zoology, over 150,000 volumes fill some 25 high-ceilinged rooms spread over four floors. To withstand the sheer weight of all those hardbacks, the building, which began life as a prep school in c1878, must surely be as strong as a <a href="https://www.worldofinteriors.com/story/lewes-group-frescoes-sussex">Romanesque church</a>.</p><p>Certainly the collection has been assembled with an almost religious zeal by sole trader Richard Axe, a spry 70-something who spoke to me from the Philippines, where he lives with his wife roughly half the year. Unlike the more commercially oriented of his peers, he has sold books primarily so that he could acquire more for himself. Of the Harrogate shop he owned prior to his move here he says: ‘Its main purpose was not to sell at all, but rather to buy and increase my buying profile.’ I had fondly imagined that Richard chose Aysgarth in order to lure customers from the nearby falls, a <a href="https://www.worldofinteriors.com/story/weird-walk-book-review">daytrippers’ magnet</a>. But in fact, he says he’s never advertised, nor had more than four visitors per week, and all of them were by appointment. Yet very rarely did a week pass by without him shifting at least £1,000 worth of books.</p><figure><p><span><p>Stacked from floor to ceiling with second-hand books, the 25-room former youth hostel in Aysgarth, North Yorkshire, has been occupied by bookseller Richard Axe for two decades</p>
</span></p></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>So how did his business, which has been highly successful, operate? Most professionals in the field swim in the waters of either ‘good quality but relatively ordinary second-hand books’ or ‘very specialist, expensive antiquarian books’; Richard has ended up being a big fish in both streams. In his heyday, he would reckon to drive some 25,000 miles a year, attending auctions from Plymouth to Glasgow. There he’d bid for large lots, sometimes <a href="https://www.worldofinteriors.com/story/mary-evans-picture-library-blackheath-london">whole libraries</a>, subsequently selling a handful of important titles to private customers and international dealers, while creaming off books for his own collection. Hence, in part, the appeal of North Yorkshire. Far from being ‘the back of beyond’, the A1, M1 and East Coast mainline railway offer superb connections. ‘I like the idea of being in the middle of the country.’</p><figure><p><span><p>The custom-built wooden shelves stretch to a combined length of over a mile</p>
</span></p></figure><div data-testid="GroupCalloutWrapper"><figure><p><span><p>Art and design books, recently purchased, await shelving. Prominent in the pile is a book by the late artist and postcard aficionado <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=10P_Tr57ggnRf8eLNzK_zMhhrSnPAF2IQ&amp;usp=drive_f">Tom Phillips</a>, whose house was featured in <em>WoI</em> Sept 2025</p>
</span></p></figure><figure><p><span><p>An armchair with access to plenty of light creates a reading nook between two stacks</p>
</span></p></figure></div><p>For the eagle-eyed expert, the condition of a book is critical. Richard gives the example of Dickens – ‘incredibly popular in his own lifetime, and so a first edition in reasonably good nick might fetch £50. But a really fine copy could go for ten times that.’ As is the case with all <a href="https://www.worldofinteriors.com/interiors/antiques">antiques</a>, the internet has had a polarising effect. In the past, you might have traipsed round bookshops for a lifetime not finding the missing piece in your authorial jigsaw, but often such editions previously thought rare can now be quite easily unearthed via online search engines, and so their value has slumped. ‘But what’s transpired is that things that are genuinely uncommon have shot up.’</p><figure><p><span><p>A run of spines from Collins’s ‘New Naturalist’ series offers a burst of colour in a top-floor room devoted to zoology, topography and horticulture</p>
</span></p></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The classic case is JK Rowling’s <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone</em>. Given that it was the first in the sequence, Bloomsbury, with no inkling of the monster the brand would become, published the smallest viable number of copies – 500 – in its first edition. It is thus truly rare, says Richard, much more so than a Jane Austen equivalent. As a consequence: ‘A fine copy is worth, certainly, £50,000.’ Similarly, photograph albums and manuscripts, by definition one-off items, have seen skyrocketing interest in cyberspace – and among a new, <a href="https://www.worldofinteriors.com/story/new-deal-antique-dealers-online-entrepreneurs">younger breed of collector</a> to boot. Indeed, the most expensive item my interlocutor has ever sold was not a book at all, but a scrapbook owned by <a href="https://www.worldofinteriors.com/story/hamishsphere-cecil-beaton-home">Cecil Beaton</a>, which included the photographer’s own drawing of Mick Jagger, a personal friend, and sketches by <a href="https://www.worldofinteriors.com/story/jean-cocteau-picasso-friendship">Jean Cocteau</a>.</p><div data-testid="GroupCalloutWrapper"><figure><p><span><p>A map of York reflects the rolling dales in a room devoted to leather-bound antiquarian books</p>
</span></p></figure><figure><p><span><p>Richard Axe has deployed every little sliver of real estate to house his 150,000-plus books. A staircase makes the ideal spot for shelving titles about mountaineering and hiking</p>
</span></p></figure></div><p>When Richard moved to his property in 2005, consolidating a warehouse, shop and large house in Harrogate, little structural work was required to the sturdily built edifice apart from new guttering, though he had to strip out rows of urinals and a few municipal-style kitchens. Inevitably, however, two men were employed full time for a year just building wooden shelves, which now stretch to a combined length of over a mile. The original plan was to carve out some domestic space in this behemoth of a building, but Richard states that mixing residence and business had potential VAT implications. And then there was the small issue of his ever-encroaching <a href="https://www.worldofinteriors.com/story/libraries">library</a>… So he moved into the two-bedroom modern cottage previously inhabited by the youth-hostel manager. Presumably you had a no-book policy here, I ask Richard. ‘Well, if I did, it didn’t last,’ he replies ruefully. ‘Let’s just say it was restricted.’</p><figure><p><span><p>This two-bedroom cottage, built in the 1980s, is where the youth-hostel manager used to live. Now Richard relaxes here after a hard day humping boxes, cataloguing and shelving</p>
</span></p></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Philosophical follies, such as doorknobs surreally attached to tree trunks, dot the unusual sculpture garden that Richard has proudly created out of a capacious paddock that’s part of the estate. In the middle of the pond sits an inaccessible table and chairs overhung with a metal fruit basket you also cannot reach. ‘It’s all about, you know, the unattainable.’ This modern take on the Tantalus myth strikes me as the perfect symbol for the avid collector, feverishly hunting down the final piece of a set, mourning the rarities that slipped through one’s fingers. The psychological make-up of the type emerged early on. Even as a Dulwich College scholarship boy, ‘I collected stamps rather more avidly than most.’ Later, at Bristol University, ‘I bought books initially to read, but the physical possession of having quite a lot, of having a substantial range of bookshelves, became important as a manifestation of knowledge and understanding and culture.’ Even now, he can find himself transfixed when, say, a history of <a href="https://www.worldofinteriors.com/story/andrew-grundon-pub-sign-painting-studio-united-kingdom">signposts</a> tumbles into his lap.</p><figure><p><span><p>Richard’s modern version of the Tantalus myth is a table and chairs in the middle of a pond, overhung with an unreachable fruit bowl. In the background lies the Grade I-listed St Andrew’s church, known as the ‘Cathedral of the Dales’</p>
</span></p></figure><figure><p><span><p>The vast former hostel and its contents are now on the market. Richard is loath to break up his collection</p>
</span></p></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The physical demands of his job, combined with declining health, mean Richard ‘must face the facts of age’. With great reluctance, he is now selling his estate and collection, lock, stock and barrel, for around £1.5 million. His greatest fear is that the land, library and buildings get sold off bit by bit, ‘my life’s work just disappearing’. He is even prepared to play the role of <em>éminence grise</em> to the putative lucky buyer, sharing his contacts and experience.</p><figure><p><span><p>A room devoted to British history. Richard employed two men full-time for a year to construct bookshelves</p>
</span></p></figure><p>But what about the keepers? Surely, there are a few titles he’d like to hold on to? Well, there’s his extensive collection of antiquarian books on Yorkshire; those on another great love, football (‘though the Philippines is pretty much the only country in the world that doesn’t have an interest’); books on the fluctuatingly fashionable <a href="https://www.worldofinteriors.com/story/colour-revolution-exhibition-ashmolean">Ruskin</a>, as well as 18th- and 19th-century folding maps that the chin-stroking aesthete might have consulted himself while hiking in the Lakes. Oh, and let’s not forget the collection of 1750s–1870s books in their original drab boards or cloth. ‘Cheaper to buy at the time, because they were unbound, they are now valuable because of their fragility.’ The bookseller’s eyes sparkle.</p><hr/><p><em>To enquire about purchasing the property plus stock, ring Elaine Williams-Bird on 07798 818651 or email nellybirdpress@gmail.com</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
