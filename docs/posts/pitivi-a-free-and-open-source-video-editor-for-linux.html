    <p>The Pitivi video editor is based on the GStreamer Editing Services library (GES). Various projects use GES to manage audio or video projects and export the project to a new file to be distributed.
Pitivi is developed in very close contact with GES. Both Pitivi and GES would benefit a lot from better documentation.
We’re applying to the Season of Docs program, where Google pays technical writers to contribute to open-source projects.</p>

    <li><time datetime="2019-05-10">May 10, 2019</time></li>
</ul>

    <p>Pitivi 1.0 is scheduled to be released on Monday, May 20th. All the important bugs we were aware of have been fixed.
To fix one of the last issues, Thibault very recently rewrote the timeline/layers/clips management in GES, and this might have introduced new bugs. While we have lots of tests which all pass, they don’t cover everything.
We ask you to test the 1.0 RC! Grab a bunch of video files shot with your phone or camera and make some video out of them, trying various features.</p>

    <p>The Pitivi video editor is based on the GStreamer Editing Services library. GES makes it easy to manage the timeline of a video project and export it to a new video file, and is carefully built to be reusable by other projects, not only Pitivi.
Since a few years ago, while not mentoring students for GSoC, we’ve been busy working on Pitivi 1.0, about to be released. A large part of this was spent on fixing and improving the GES library.</p>
