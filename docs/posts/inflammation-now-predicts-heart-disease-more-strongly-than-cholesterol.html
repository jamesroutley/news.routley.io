    <h1>Inflammation now predicts heart disease more strongly than cholesterol</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <div> <div> <h2>Inflammation now predicts heart disease more strongly than cholesterol</h2> <p> <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/brandonballinger">Brandon Ballinger</a> </p> <p> <time datetime="2025-09-29T00:00:00.000Z"> Sep 29, 2025 </time> </p> </div>  <p>Chronic inflammation has long been known to double your risk of heart disease, but prior to now,
inflammation has never been a SMuRF: <strong>s</strong>tandard <strong>m</strong>odifiable <strong>r</strong>isk <strong>f</strong>actor for heart disease.</p>
<p>The American College of Cardiology just released recommendations that change that. The ACC is now recommending that everyone
measure inflammation (specifically, hs-CRP) via a blood test:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because clinicians will not treat what they do not measure, universal screening of hsCRP in both primary and secondary prevention patients, in combination with cholesterol, represents a major clinical opportunity and is therefore recommended. <a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.047">American College of Cardiology</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were a many interesting bits of evidence that led to this recommendation. The whole <a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.08.047">article, published in JACC</a>, is worth a read, but this blog post extracts a few of the most interesting parts — or at
least, the parts I thought were most interesting.</p>
<p>
Want to skip ahead and measure your inflammation? Empirical Health&#39;s <a href="https://www.empirical.health/product/comprehensive-health-panel?utm_source=blog">advanced heart health panel</a> includes hs-CRP, ApoB, Lp(a), and other critical heart health biomarkers.
</p>
<hr/>

<p>For decades, LDL cholesterol (or <a href="https://www.empirical.health/blog/apob-blood-test/">ApoB</a>) has been the main focus of cardiovascular risk assessment. But
this chart shows hs-CRP is actually a <em>stronger</em> predictor of heart disease than LDL.</p>
<p><img alt="Inflammation vs LDL cholesterol" loading="lazy" decoding="async" fetchpriority="auto" width="407" height="620" src="https://www.empirical.health/_astro/ldl_vs_inflammation.B5MkNi52_Z2655L8.webp"/></p>
<p>Why? In some ways, <strong>cholesterol has become a victim of its own success.</strong> We now screen the whole population
for high cholesterol, give statins to those with high LDL (or ApoB), and so then the majority of people who
end up having heart attacks have lower cholesterol than they would naturally have. This means most of
the majority of residual risk for heart attacks will be found in biomarkers that aren’t SMuRFs.</p>
<p>Inflammation (hs-CRP) is one such non-SMuRF, one perhaps one of the strongest. This is especially true
in people already on statins or those without traditional risk factors (sometimes called “SMuRF-less” patients).
In these groups, cholesterol may be well controlled, but inflammation remains a key driver of events.</p>
<p>Of course, other traditional risk factors matter <em>in addition</em> to inflammation: blood pressure, HbA1c or
insulin resistance, eGFR (kidney function), and so on.</p>

<p>The ACC consensus reviews a range of clinical trials testing both drugs and lifestyle interventions for lowering inflammation and reducing cardiovascular risk. Here’s a summary of the clinical trials and their results:</p>

<p><strong>What works</strong> to lower inflammation?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statins</strong> (especially in people with high hs-CRP): Substantial reduction in events, even when LDL is normal (JUPITER trial).</li>
<li><strong>Colchicine</strong>: Reduces recurrent events in people with established heart disease (COLCOT, LoDoCo2).</li>
<li><strong>Canakinumab</strong>: Reduces events but is expensive and increases infection risk (CANTOS).</li>
<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Anti-inflammatory diets (Mediterranean, DASH), regular exercise, smoking cessation, and maintaining a healthy weight all lower hs-CRP and reduce risk.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What doesn’t work?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some anti-inflammatory drugs (methotrexate, TNF inhibitors, corticosteroids) have not shown benefit in major trials.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’ve already measured your hs-CRP (great!), then it’s ideally below &lt;1 mg/L. hs-CRP above 3 mg/L is
high risk:</p>

<p>The ACC evaluated other markers: IL-6, fibrinogen, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, EPA/AA ratio, and serum amyloid A.
These have also been shown to predict cardiovascular risk, but once hs-CRP is known, don’t add more signal.</p>
<p>In other words, you’re best off simply measuring hs-CRP, and then spending money elsewhere on heart health.</p>

<p>The JACC article is packed with other interesting insights. These ones were interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imaging biomarkers</strong> (like CT, PET, MRI, and perivascular “fat attenuation index”) can detect vascular inflammation and may help predict coronary events, but are not yet ready for routine clinical use.</li>
<li><strong>Bempedoic acid</strong> is a newer cholesterol-lowering drug that also lowers hs-CRP, but its long-term outcomes are still being studied.</li>
<li><strong>Residual inflammatory risk</strong>: Even with well-controlled LDL on statins, many people still have elevated hs-CRP and ongoing risk—so inflammation should be addressed separately from cholesterol.</li>
<li><strong>Universal hs-CRP screening</strong> is now recommended by the ACC for both people with and without established heart disease.</li>
<li><strong>Colchicine (0.5 mg/d)</strong> is now FDA-approved as an adjunct for secondary prevention in stable ASCVD, but should be avoided in people with significant kidney or liver disease.</li>
<li><strong>Novel IL-6 inhibitors</strong> are being studied as future anti-inflammatory therapies for heart disease.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-measure-your-inflammation"><a href="#how-to-measure-your-inflammation">How to measure your inflammation</a></h2>
<p>A simple blood test for hs-CRP is widely available and inexpensive. The ACC now recommends routine hs-CRP testing for both people at risk (primary prevention) and those with established heart disease (secondary prevention).</p>
