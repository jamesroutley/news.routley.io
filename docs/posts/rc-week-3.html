    <h1>RC: Week 3</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org668a16f">
        <p>This week we did the so called &#34;impossible day&#34; where we set our
        goal on doing something impossible, that is, outside of what we
        expected to be able to do. I&#39;ve slowly getting to grip with
        web-development, and wanted to make a side-project to my generative ML
        project where I want to <a href="https://github.com/socketteer/RC-week-2.html#org3bcd72b">generate
        novel images of the RC hub</a> in the form of an online portal where
        people could upload images of the hub which I store in a database. Just
        days before we had gotten $100 credits at <a href="https://render.com/">render.com</a> which I wanted to use to improve
        my understanding on how to actually build a functioning web-app and
        deploy it and make it available using a Recurse sub-domain. Here is the
        <a href="https://rcnexists.recurse.com/">resulting website</a>!</p>
        <p>With some help from some good web-dev people through pair
        programming I actually managed to get something together and deploy it
        successfully (although extremely bare-bones and barely working). All in
        all, I managed to</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn how to use the <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/">flask framework</a>.
          </li>
          <li>Set up a postgresql server to store the images through render.com
          and integrate it into the code.</li>
          <li>Accept user input using some <code>input</code> HTML tags.</li>
          <li>Set up a Recurse sub-domain to point to the deployed render
          server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This was a great experience and I am thankful to those that helped
        me out!</p>
