    <h1>I built a pixel art editor after playing Octopath Traveler II</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>After playing <i>Octopath Traveler II</i>, I was really inspired by its art style and decided to create my own pixel drawing app from scratch. It&#39;s still in the early stages, but it already supports basic drawing, undo/redo, and a clean UI focused on pixel-perfect design.</p><p>I plan to add frame-by-frame animation support in the next version.</p><p>You&#39;re welcome to try it out and share your thoughts!  
If you like the project, a  on GitHub would mean a lot to me.</p><p>Live demo: https://ayanamiii.netlify.app/</p><p>GitHub: https://github.com/KamiC6238/ayanami</p></div></div></div>
