</p><p>Each mode of a multimode fiber can be used as an independent transmission channel. The multi-mode optical fiber used in this experiment is designed to support up to 55 propagation modes and to minimize the delay difference between the modes. The core diameter is 0.050 mm.</p>

</div><p><b id="yougo3">Standard cladding diameter optical fiber</b>
</p><p>The international standard specifies that the outer diameter of the glass (cladding) of the optical fiber is 0.125 Â± 0.0007 mm and the outer diameter of the coating layer is 0.235 to 0.265 mm. The optical fiber widely used in the present optical communication systems is a single-core single-mode fiber with a cladding diameter of 0.125 mm, and the transmission capacity is limited to approximately 250 terabits per second. Research and development of new standard cladding diameter optical fibers is actively conducted.</p>

<p><b id="yougo4">Optical fiber transmission windows</b>
</p><p>There are C-band (wavelength 1,530 to 1,565 nm) and L-band (1,565 to 1,625 nm), which are mainly used for commerical communication applications, and O-band (1,260 to 1,360 nm), E-band (1,360 to 1,460 nm), S-band (1,460 to 1,530 nm), and U-band (1,625 to 1,675 nm). Only the C band was used this time.</p>

<p><b id="yougo6">Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technology</b>
</p><p>WDM is a method of transmitting optical signals of different wavelengths within a single optical fiber. WDM is a widely used technology to increase the transmission capacity in proportion to the number of wavelengths. However, the available bandwidth suitable for efficient optical transmission is limited and the current number of wavelengths used in current long-distance optical transmission systems is typically around 90 in the C-band. The number of wavelengths can be expanded by using L-band and S-band together (multiband).</p>
<p>The capacity limit of the standard single-core, single-mode optical fiber currently used is about 250 terabits per second. To solve this problem, multi-core optical fibers with increased number of cores (signal paths) and multi-mode optical fibers have been investigated. The 4-core optical fiber with standard cladding diameter is attractive for early adoption of new space-division multiplexing fibers in high-throughput and long-distance links since it is compatible with conventional cable infrastructure, expected to have mechanical reliability comparable to standard single-mode fibers, and does not require the complex signal processing needed for unscrambling signals in multi-mode fibers.</p>

</div>
</div><p><b id="yougo8">Propagation characteristics for each mode</b>
</p><p>In a multimode optical fiber, the propagation loss and delay are generally different among modes. When the mode dependent loss is large, the quality of the signal deteriorates. When the difference in the propagation delay is large, the scale of the circuit required for the MIMO processing increases.</p>

<p><b id="yougo9">Mode multiplexer / demultiplexer</b>
</p><p>Transmitter and receiver sub-systems are largely based on single-mode fiber technology. Therefore, a novel device is necessary that can convert the signal from 55 input signals to be compatible with the 55 modes, guided by the multi-mode fiber. In this experiment, a novel wideband mode multiplexer was employed that was based on reflecting the light from 55 input fibers multiple times on a phase plate to generate signals that are compatible with the 55-mode fiber.</p>
<p>MIMO is a signal processing technology that was originally used in wireless communications to eliminate multi-path interference. In optical communications, MIMO is a signal processing technology to remove interference between signals that propagate in the same fiber core. The complexity of MIMO processing increases with the number of fiber modes and if the range of propagation speed between modes increases.</p>
<p>QAM is a multi-level modulation format with high spectral information density. 16 QAM uses 16 different signal symbols and can therefore encode 4 bits of information. The spectral density of 16 QAM is therefore 4 times higher than for simple modulation formats such as on-off keying. The data rate can be doubled by polarization multiplexing in which different data signals are transmitted in two orthogonal polarization states.</p>
