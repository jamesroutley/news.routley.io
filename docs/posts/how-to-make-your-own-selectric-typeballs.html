<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/selectric/" rel="nofollow">IBM Selectric typewriter</a> uses an instantly-recognizable &#34;ball&#34; of type instead of a fanned-out array of arms like a conventional typewriter. These typeballs could be swapped out, meaning you could easily write documents with different fonts, font sizes, special characters, or different writing systems altogether.</p>
<p dir="auto">IBM and some other vendors made lots of different typeballs, but most of them are 40-50 years old and no one has been making new typeballs for a long time. 3D printing is a natural fit for making new typeballs, but most printers still don&#39;t have the ability to produce the sharp details necessary on a sufficiently-resilient material. So it&#39;s understandable that no one made a really functional 3D-printable typeball. Until now, that is!</p>

<p dir="auto">Things you need before getting started:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>OpenSCAD</li>
<li>A Python installation with the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pymeshlab/" rel="nofollow">pymeshlab</a> package</li>
</ul>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open <code>oneletter.scad</code> and change lines 11 and 12, the ones that specify the font height (in millimeters) and the font name/style for OpenSCAD to use.</li>
<li>Open <code>selectric_generator.py</code> and change line 5, the one that says <code>PATH TO OPENSCAD = r&#34;{something}&#34;</code> so that it points to your installation of <code>openscad.com</code> (not <code>openscad.exe</code>! They are in the same folder probably, but the <code>.com</code> is meant to be run from command line, which is what we&#39;ll be doing.</li>
<li>If you want to change the characters on the balls, edit <code>glyph_tables.py</code>. This contains a multi-dimensional array of the characters as they are arrayed on the typeball, <em>not as they are laid out on the keyboard</em>. If you want to use a different character set than the standard Latin, you&#39;ll have to find a correspondence between the new set and your preexisting keyboard layout. Sorry this part may be extra-confusing.</li>
<li>Run <code>selectric_generator.py</code>. On my machine, each character takes between 1 and 30 seconds to generate, depending on their complexity. So 88 characters will take a while, be patient!</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">The blank typeball is based on <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4126040" rel="nofollow">1944GPW&#39;s typeball on Thingiverse</a>, which is released under a Creative Commons-Attribution license. I suspect that my project wouldn&#39;t exist if it weren&#39;t for this one. I had to change most of their typeball dimensions, and there are major issues with the way their characters are generated, but I sure as heck would have made those same errors myself, so I&#39;m infinitely grateful for the people before me who documented their processes!</p>

<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/settinger/selectric_typeballs/blob/main/img/loft.png"><img src="https://github.com/settinger/selectric_typeballs/raw/main/img/loft.png" alt="A Meshlab render of the octothorpe symbol with lofted edges"/></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Getting those nice lofted edges on each glyph was not easy! I came up with a rather elaborate way that worked pretty well, but then got an excellent suggestion from Kris Slyka that works so, so much better. This is truly a community effort. I&#39;d be very curious to hear how you would have approached it!!</p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4126040" rel="nofollow">OpenSCAD Typeball by 1944GPW</a> attempts to loft the shapes by scaling the letterform. This was my first thought, as well, but since the letters scale around a specific point, it means the lofted sides won&#39;t all spread out evenly. Instead you get unhelpful overhangs:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/settinger/selectric_typeballs/blob/main/img/badloft.png"><img src="https://github.com/settinger/selectric_typeballs/raw/main/img/badloft.png" alt="An OpenSCAD render of the letter &#34;N&#34; with steeply slanted edges that would not print well"/></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of a scaled extrusion, we need the base to be a puffed-out offset version of the original letterform. It&#39;s not trivial to do that in an automated fashion, especially if there are small holes that will close up (like in the middle of the # character). The method I came up with uses a command-line script to extrude the letter in OpenSCAD and then displace one layer of vertices by their normal vectors. This means the vertex will always be pushed <em>out</em> away from the body of the STL.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/settinger/selectric_typeballs/blob/main/img/pvgm1.png"><img src="https://github.com/settinger/selectric_typeballs/raw/main/img/pvgm1.png" alt=""/></a>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/settinger/selectric_typeballs/blob/main/img/pvgm2.png"><img src="https://github.com/settinger/selectric_typeballs/raw/main/img/pvgm2.png" alt=""/></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you look at the underside of each letter, you&#39;ll see a that this method leaves a lot of topological scars from attempts to re-mesh this self-intersecting shape. But it turned out to be pretty printable, so I released the project with this approach.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/settinger/selectric_typeballs/blob/main/img/loft_nonmani.png"><img src="https://github.com/settinger/selectric_typeballs/raw/main/img/loft_nonmani.png" alt=""/></a></p>
<p dir="auto">After seeing the discussion about typeballs on Mastodon, Kris Slyka approached me to suggest using OpenSCAD&#39;s <code>minkowski()</code> function. It has a reputation for being agonizingly slow, and trying to generate all the glyphs at once would exhaust my PC&#39;s memory, but with the batch-script, one-letter-at-a-time method, it can work! I highly recommend getting a recent build of OpenSCAD nightly; the fast-csg setting makes <code>minkowski()</code> operations so, so much faster.</p>

<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.printables.com/search/models?q=tag:typeball%20@settinger_263029" rel="nofollow">I put some typeballs on Printables!</a> They are also available on Shapeways (links in the Printables descriptions) if you don&#39;t want to print them yourself.</p>
<p dir="auto">To affix the typeball to the typewriter, you will need a bent wire or a small clip <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/416841-selectric-ball-clip" rel="nofollow">such as this one from Dave Hayden</a>. Thank you Dave for encouraging me to pick up the Selectric project again!</p>
<p dir="auto">I had been testing on a not-fully-functional Selectric I, which I think was set to 12 characters per inch. Knowing characters per inch is important for joined/cursive scripts like Mongolian. It would really help if I knew how to change the writing direction, I know some Selectrics had an RTL/LTR switch...</p>
<p dir="auto">Other right-to-left scripts to try: Thaana, N&#39;ko</p>
<p dir="auto">Other typeballs to try: Osage, Tifinagh, various runes, emoji, Avoiuli, um......what else?</p>
