    <h1>A push to bury a weedkiller’s link to Parkinson’s disease</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p>The global chemical giant Syngenta has sought to secretly influence scientific research regarding links between its top-selling weedkiller and Parkinson’s, internal corporate documents show.</p><p>While numerous independent researchers have determined that the weedkiller, paraquat, can cause neurological changes that are hallmarks of Parkinson’s, Syngenta has always maintained that the evidence linking paraquat to Parkinson’s disease is<a href="https://www.paraquat.com/en/safety/safety-humans/paraquat-and-parkinsons-disease" data-link-name="in body link"> “fragmentary” and “inconclusive”</a>.</p><p>But the scientific record they point to as proof of paraquat’s safety is the same one that Syngenta officials, scientists and lawyers in the US and the UK have worked over decades to create and at times, covertly manipulate, according to the trove of internal Syngenta files reviewed by the Guardian and the New Lede.</p><p>The files reveal an array of tactics, including enlisting a prominent UK scientist and other outside researchers who authored scientific literature that did not disclose any involvement with Syngenta; misleading regulators about the existence of unfavorable research conducted by its own scientists; and engaging lawyers to review and suggest edits for scientific reports in ways that downplayed worrisome findings.</p><gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/06/archive-zip/giv-13425UJj5Ke8YJEzn/&#34;,&#34;scriptUrl&#34;:&#34;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&#34;,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;A snippet from a Syngenta internal documents describing the Swat team’s purpose&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;supporting&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:1,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:9},&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;d8aaabf0-d531-493c-abbd-6134b11bdca4&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;A detail from a Syngenta internal document about its Swat team.&#34;,&#34;isMainMedia&#34;:false}"><figure id="d8aaabf0-d531-493c-abbd-6134b11bdca4" data-alt="A snippet from a Syngenta internal documents describing the Swat team’s purpose" data-cypress="interactive-element-A%20snippet%20from%20a%20Syngenta%20internal%20documents%20describing%20the%20Swat%20team%E2%80%99s%20purpose" data-spacefinder-role="supporting"><div data-name="placeholder"></div><a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/06/archive-zip/giv-13425UJj5Ke8YJEzn/">A snippet from a Syngenta internal documents describing the Swat team’s purpose</a></figure><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A detail from a Syngenta internal document about its Swat team.</span></figcaption></gu-island><p>The files also show that Syngenta created what officials called a “Swat team” to be ready to respond to new independent scientific reports that could interfere with Syngenta’s <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/May-2003-Syngenta-Regulatory-strategy-2.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">“freedom to sell”</a> paraquat.

The lawyer pushed scientists to alter “problematic language” and scientific conclusions deemed “unhelpful” to the corporate defense of paraquat.</p><p>Syngenta’s decision to involve lawyers in the editing of its scientific reports and other communications in ways that downplayed concerning findings potentially related to public health is unacceptable, said Wendy Wagner, a law professor at the University of Texas who has served on several National Academies of Science committees. “Clearly the lawyers are involved in order to limit liability,” she said.</p><p>“It happens regularly in cases where a corporation’s internal research puts it at a high risk of expensive lawsuits. Regrettably, this kind of effective legal ghostwriting of scientific reports happens far too often in the chemical industry. Scientifically it doesn’t seem acceptable,” Wagner said.</p><p>When asked to comment about the contents of the documents, a Syngenta spokesperson said: “We care deeply about the health and wellbeing of farmers and are dedicated to providing them safe and effective products. As a responsible company, we have spent millions of dollars on testing our products to make them safe for their intended use.”</p><p>Syngenta further said there had been more than 1,200 studies of paraquat and none have “established a causal connection between paraquat and Parkinson’s disease”.</p><figure id="a7a6cf1b-6cb5-43f9-8755-a14866da8dcf" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.QABlockElement"><gu-island name="QandaAtomWrapper" deferuntil="visible" props="{&#34;id&#34;:&#34;1c394bc6-13ce-4491-9bb6-378aae3f10cc&#34;,&#34;title&#34;:&#34;Syngenta’s response - at length&#34;,&#34;html&#34;:&#34;&lt;p&gt;Syngenta spokesperson Saswato Das wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We care deeply about the health and well-being of farmers and are dedicated to providing them safe and effective products.

Paraquat has been shown in some research to increase the risk of Parkinson’s by <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21269927/" data-link-name="in body link">150%</a> and is cited <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/ray-dorsey-md/ending-parkinsons-disease/9781541724495/?lens=publicaffairs" data-link-name="in body link">in a 2020 book</a>, Ending Parkinson’s Disease, by four of the world’s leading neurologists as a causal factor for the disease.</p><p>The documents revealing Syngenta’s efforts to influence science build on other evidence of questionable corporate practices with regard to paraquat. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/20/syngenta-weedkiller-pesticide-parkinsons-disease-paraquat-documents" data-link-name="in body link">set of internal documents</a> revealed last year by the Guardian and the New Lede made clear, among other things, that Syngenta had evidence 50 years ago that paraquat could accumulate in the human brain.</p><p>Those documents showed that Syngenta was aware decades ago of evidence that exposure to paraquat could impair the central nervous system, triggering tremors and other symptoms in experimental animals similar to those suffered by people with Parkinson’s.</p><p>They also showed that Syngenta worked covertly to keep a highly regarded scientist studying causes of Parkinson’s from sitting on an advisory panel for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the chief US regulator for paraquat and other pesticides.</p><p>The new documents have emerged at a sensitive time for Syngenta. In less than six months, the Swiss chemical giant faces a first-ever trial in litigation brought by US farmers and others who allege the company’s paraquat weedkiller causes Parkinson’s.</p><h2 id="influence-future-work-by-researchers">‘Influence future work’ by researchers</h2><p>It was 2003, and Syngenta officials should have been celebrating: the company’s self-proclaimed “blockbuster” paraquat herbicide product, sold under the brand name Gramoxone, was considered one of the world’s top weedkillers, used by farmers across the globe. Sales of $420m were forecast for steady growth.</p><p>But at the same time, multiple independent researchers were increasingly reporting evidence that the herbicide might be a cause of rising levels of Parkinson’s, a disease particularly <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/sites/default/files/2022-10/Overview-of-the-Agricultural-Health-Study.pdf" data-link-name="in body link">seen in farmers. </a>Roughly 90,000 Americans are diagnosed each year with Parkinson’s. Symptoms include tremors, rigidity of the muscles, a loss of coordination, and difficulty speaking.</p><p>In the face of the developing research, the new documents show, Syngenta decided that it needed a “coherent strategy across all disciplines focusing on external influencing, that proactively diffuses the potential threats that we face”, according to the minutes of a June 2003 company meeting.</p><p>To achieve that goal, the company set several objectives, including attempting to “influence future work by external researchers where possible”.</p><p>A key strategy was the engagement of scientists outside the company who could write papers that supported Syngenta’s defense of paraquat.</p><p>Similar strategies have been pursued by other chemical companies and in other industries when safety questions arose about profitable products. Monsanto, for example, was found to have <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-09/monsanto-was-its-own-ghostwriter-for-some-safety-reviews" data-link-name="in body link">ghostwritten</a> scientific studies about a widely used chemical called glyphosate, the active ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup herbicide.</p><figure id="34d92d82-7566-4ebb-be2a-e0ec13f36fb2" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=880&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=800&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=640&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Syngenta signage is displayed outside the company’s booth during the Farm Progress Show in Decatur, Illinois, in August 2017." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c712117c039e07612e2788bcf7d70b8c16e1f5dc/0_0_4000_2667/master/4000.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="296.70374999999996" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Syngenta signage is displayed outside the company’s booth during the Farm Progress Show in Decatur, Illinois, in August 2017.</span> Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The newly uncovered records show that among the scientists with which Syngenta had a consulting arrangement was the prominent British pathologist Sir Colin Berry, who in 2003 became president of the British Academy of Forensic Sciences.</p><p>According to testimony given in a deposition by the top Syngenta scientist Philip Botham, and other records, Berry became a participant in Syngenta’s “extended health science team”, attending company meetings on paraquat. The company had several similar relationships with outside scientists who authored papers to submit to scientific journals, the records show.</p><p>Berry co-authored a paper published in 2010 titled<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/cdd2009217" data-link-name="in body link"> “Paraquat and Parkinson’s Disease”</a> in Cell Death &amp; Differentiation, a journal owned by the <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-portfolio" data-link-name="in body link">Nature Portfolio</a>, It concluded that the link between paraquat and Parkinson’s was weak and evidence linking the chemical to the disease was “limited” and based on “insufficient” data. Along with Berry, two other external scientists were listed as authors.</p><p>The paper’s ethics declaration did not disclose that any of the three had a relationship with Syngenta specifically. It only stated that “the researchers have worked with pharmaceutical and chemical companies as external advisors. This work reflects their scientific experience and independent views.”</p><p>But a memorandum from a lawyer advising Syngenta suggests that the work was not independent. The memo stresses the “importance of proactively publishing research studies that discredit the alleged connection between paraquat and Parkinson’s disease” – and cites, in this context, the “continuing (Syngenta-sponsored) work” by Berry and the other two authors of the 2010 paper.</p><gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/06/archive-zip/giv-13425h1v7zO5PhOfz/&#34;,&#34;scriptUrl&#34;:&#34;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&#34;,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;A snippet from a Syngenta internal document.&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:1,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:9},&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;3a51c975-e65f-42dc-98f3-a7bb888f1dfa&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;Part of an internal document describing the ‘Syngenta-sponsored’ work of three scientists.&#34;,&#34;isMainMedia&#34;:false}"><figure id="3a51c975-e65f-42dc-98f3-a7bb888f1dfa" data-alt="A snippet from a Syngenta internal document." data-cypress="interactive-element-A%20snippet%20from%20a%20Syngenta%20internal%20document." data-spacefinder-role="inline"><div data-name="placeholder"></div><a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/06/archive-zip/giv-13425h1v7zO5PhOfz/">A snippet from a Syngenta internal document.</a></figure><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Part of an internal document describing the ‘Syngenta-sponsored’ work of three scientists.</span></figcaption></gu-island><p>The same memorandum noted that public knowledge of “Syngenta-sponsored” work could have “adverse consequences”.</p><p>Syngenta cites the study on its “Paraquat information center” website.</p><p>When asked about his work for Syngenta, Berry acknowledged an ongoing relationship, but said the 2010 paper was not “sponsored” by the company. He said he currently served as chair of a Syngenta “ethics committee”.</p><p>Another author of the paper, Pierluigi Nicotera, scientific director and chairman of the executive board of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, said that his consultant arrangement with Syngenta ended in 2008 and he was not paid to write the 2010 article. He said the paper “reflected the views of the authors based on the available data at the time”.

This finding is judged to be real, to be related to treatment and to be adverse in nature. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is prudent to assume that this finding is potentially qualitatively relevant to man.”</p><p>Wolff wrote back suggesting the removal of the words “and to be adverse in nature”, questioning the phrasing of the relevance to humans, and other changes, agreeing with the in-house attorney that the statement overall was “unhelpful”.</p><p>Among other instances, in 2009, records show that Wolff worked with an in-house company lawyer to edit a presentation by a company scientist for Syngenta’s leadership team titled “Paraquat and Parkinson’s Disease”.</p><p>Wolff expressed concerns about “blunt statements” and the “sensitive nature of the subject”, and advised that only a single electronic copy be presented because it was “not in Syngenta’s interest for multiple copies of this document to be in circulation”.</p><p>In one key edit, Wolff suggested deleting a statement that read: “The combination of experimental data and epidemiological data provides plausibility to the claim that PQ [paraquat] is implicated in PD [Parkinson’s disease].”</p><p>Wolff also took issue with a statement that said only a small percentage of Parkinson’s cases were genetic, with the “majority resulting from gene-environment or environmental causes”. Wolff suggested, instead, that the presentation say “The great majority of PD cases are idiopathic or of unknown cause.”</p><p>Today it is <a href="https://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons/causes/genetics" data-link-name="in body link">well-established </a>that the vast majority of Parkinson’s cases are not caused by genetics, and that environmental factors, including air pollution and pesticides, play an important role.</p><p>In another round of edits to a scientific slide show, Wolff recommended the deletion of a statement that said “We can show loss of cells” in the <em>substantia nigra pars compacta</em>. The statement was “an unhelpful admission verifying unhelpful claims which have been made in the literature” about paraquat. He said the observation could be made verbally.</p><p>He additionally asked the scientists to revise a slide that he said “suggests that [paraquat] exposure leads to cell death and direct damage to neuronal cells”. The records show revised slides were created.</p><p>In 2009, Wolff went a step further, discussing legal involvement in the production of research. He advised the company about using outside legal counsel in preparing for an epidemiology study, which would involve discussions with former workers about their exposure to paraquat at a company plant in Widnes, north-west England.</p><gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/06/archive-zip/giv-13425rD2uMukC7kNs/&#34;,&#34;scriptUrl&#34;:&#34;https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js&#34;,&#34;alt&#34;:&#34;A snippet from a Syngenta internal document&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:1,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:9},&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;a5e238b9-d643-4e48-aa55-d3f2ba7545e9&#34;,&#34;caption&#34;:&#34;A communication from lawyer Jeffrey Wolff in which he discusses if interviews with former Syngenta workers in Widnes would be confidential.&#34;,&#34;isMainMedia&#34;:false}"><figure id="a5e238b9-d643-4e48-aa55-d3f2ba7545e9" data-alt="A snippet from a Syngenta internal document" data-cypress="interactive-element-A%20snippet%20from%20a%20Syngenta%20internal%20document" data-spacefinder-role="inline"><div data-name="placeholder"></div><a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/06/archive-zip/giv-13425rD2uMukC7kNs/">A snippet from a Syngenta internal document</a></figure><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>A communication from lawyer Jeffrey Wolff in which he discusses if interviews with former Syngenta workers in Widnes would be confidential.</span></figcaption></gu-island><p>A company scientist planned to do the interviews.
