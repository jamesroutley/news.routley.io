    <h1>Ask HN: Anyone using proprietary Unix at work?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I was born in the late 90s so by the time I got involved in technology, my introduction to Unix and Unix-flavored systems was limited to Linux and MacOS. However, I&#39;ve read about the history of Unix at Bell Labs, the BSD systems derived from research Unix, and the eventual commercial releases of Unix System V from AT&amp;T themselves. I also see that HP-UX, AIX, and Solaris are apparently still maintained and get releases, which suggests that they are still being used in production in some places.</p><p>I&#39;m curious if anyone here currently works (or has very recently worked) somewhere where proprietary Unix is still used for production. If so, can you tell me what they&#39;re used for and why those deployments haven&#39;t been moved to an appropriate Linux distribution?</p><p>Not suggesting Linux is necessarily better for all use cases, just wondering what keeps these small number of entities clinging to closed-source Unix with presumably pricey license costs.</p></div></div></div>
