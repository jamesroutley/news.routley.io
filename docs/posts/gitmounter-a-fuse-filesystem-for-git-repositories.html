    <h1>GitMounter: A FUSE filesystem for Git repositories</h1>

		<p><a href="https://social.jvns.ca/@b0rk/111462736760795943">A few days ago Julia Evans posted this:</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>has anyone made a read-only FUSE filesystem for a git repository where every commit is a folder and the folder contains all the files in that commit?</p>

  <p>the idea is that you could just run <code>cd COMMIT_ID</code> and poke around instead of checking out the commit</p>

  <p>and maybe the branches could be symbolic links to the commit folders?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I <em>did</em> in fact do something very like that, back when I was <a href="https://belkadan.com/blog/2020/07/Suffusion/">playing with FUSE</a>! But I never put it up anywhere cause it had an annoying build process, and didn’t seem to add much, and—</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Well, in any case, Evans asked to see it, so <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/GitMounter/">here it is</a>, cleaned up to be a plain old SwiftPM package. It should work on macOS and on Linux as long as you have FUSE (<a href="https://osxfuse.github.io">macFUSE</a> or <code>libfuse-dev</code>), libgit2, pkg-config, and Swift installed; on Linux you’ll have to create the mount directory first. (If you run the command and it fails it’ll tell you what path it tried to use.)</p>

<pre><code>% swift run mount-git /path/to/checkout
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, if you don’t know who Julia Evans is, they make <a href="https://jvns.ca">blog posts</a> and <a href="https://wizardzines.com">zines</a> exploring all sorts of software in a way accessible to newbies and veterans alike, all with a lovely sense of discovery and enjoyment. This follow-up post to the original prompt really underscores their approach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>guys this is such a fun idea I cannot believe people are in the replies trying to explain to me why they think it is impractical</p>

  <p>the whole point of computers is to do impractical things and see what happens</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should definitely follow them and/or subscribe to their newsfeed. :-)</p>
