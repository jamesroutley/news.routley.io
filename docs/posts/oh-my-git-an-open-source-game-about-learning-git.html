The player can immediately see the results of their actions:</p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="muted" src="/assets/videos/repository.mp4"></video><p>To accommodate people who are new to Git, the game features a custom-designed <b>playing card interface</b>! The cards help remember newly introduced Git commands, but also contain a short description and an icon. Therefore, they combine both action as well as documentation:</p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="muted" src="/assets/videos/cards.mp4"></video><p>For more advanced or curious players, the game offers a <b>integrated terminal</b>, where they can execute arbitrary Git commands. There&#39;s a &#34;real&#34; Git integrated into the game, which allows players to try and learn all of Git&#39;s features.</p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="muted" src="/assets/videos/terminal-git.mp4"></video><p>To teach players how to use Git for collaboration in teams, <i>Oh My Git!</i> puts a focus on how to <b>interact with remotes</b>, and which workflows exist when dealing with multiple repositories:</p><video autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" muted="muted" src="/assets/videos/remote.mp4"></video><h2>How can I get help?
