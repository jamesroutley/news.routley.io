    <h1>Google lays off hundreds working on its voice-activated assistant – Semafor</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google is laying off hundreds of people working on its voice-activated Google Assistant software and eliminating a similar number of roles on its  knowledge and information product teams, a Google spokesperson confirmed to Semafor on Wednesday.</p><p>Google told Semafor the restructuring would help improve Google Assistant as it explores integrating newer artificial intelligence technology into its products. The company announced in October that it was using its generative AI chatbot Bard to <a href="https://blog.google/products/assistant/google-assistant-bard-generative-ai/" rel="no-referrer">build a new version</a> of Google Assistant that “extends beyond voice, understands and adapts to you and handles personal tasks in new ways.”</p><p>Google has been making periodic job cuts over the past year, including in its <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/09/13/2023/google-lays-off-hundreds-on-recruiting-team" rel="no-referrer">recruiting</a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/18/google-cuts-dozens-of-jobs-in-news-division-.html" rel="no-referrer">news divisions</a>, but it has not conducted company-wide layoffs since last January, when it eliminated approximately 12,000 roles. Its parent Alphabet reported having <a href="https://abc.xyz/assets/c2/3e/0d6d568e4f56a1d14ca6b70c3443/goog-10-q-q3-2023.pdf" rel="no-referrer">over 180,000 employees</a> as of September 2023.</p></div></div>
