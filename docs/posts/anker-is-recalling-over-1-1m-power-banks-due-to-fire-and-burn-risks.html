Those facilities can be found through the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/used-lithium-ion-batteries">Environmental Protection Agency’s website</a> or <a href="https://www.call2recycle.org/">other organizations</a> in the US that specialize in processing e-waste. Do not throw them in the trash, recycling bins, or used battery boxes provided at various retail locations.</p><p>The recall is also a reminder that power banks and backup batteries can potentially develop severe issues over time, as these particular units are almost a decade old. If you’ve been regularly using devices featuring lithium-ion batteries for a while, you’ll want to be mindful of issues like overheating or visible swelling and dispose of them properly if you think there’s a potential problem. And while the technology is currently more expensive than lithium-ion batteries, you can also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/656183/kuxius-semi-solid-state-power-bank-costs-a-little-more-but-lasts-much-longer">consider upgrading to solid-state batteries</a> which are more powerful, safer, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/631357/elecom-power-bank-battery-sodium-ion">longer lasting than what we commonly use now</a> to power our devices.</p></div></div></div>
