            <div><p><span><span><em><span><span><span>Acquisition to bring Google speed and scale to Mandiant’s unparalleled intelligence and expertise – at a time when security has never been more important</span></span></span></em></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>RESTON, Va., March 8, 2022 –</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span> Mandiant, Inc. (NASDAQ: MNDT) </span></span></span></span><span><span><span>today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by Google LLC for $23.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $5.4 billion, inclusive of Mandiant’s net cash. The offer price represents a 57% premium to the undisturbed 10-day trailing volume weighted average price as of February 7, 2022, the last full trading day prior to published market speculation regarding a potential sale of the Company. Upon the close of the acquisition, Mandiant will join Google Cloud.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For the past 18 years, Mandiant has delivered unparalleled frontline expertise and industry-leading threat intelligence. Mandiant’s more than 600 consultants currently respond to thousands of security breaches each year. Paired with research from more than 300 intelligence analysts, these resulting insights are what power Mandiant’s dynamic cyber defense solutions – delivered through the managed multi-vendor XDR platform, Mandiant Advantage.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Google Cloud has made security the cornerstone of its commitment to customers and users around the world – building cloud-native security into the foundation of its technology to block malware, phishing attempts and potential cyber attacks at scale. The Mandiant acquisition underscores Google Cloud’s commitment to advancing its security offerings to better protect and advise customers across their on-premise and cloud environments. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The acquisition will complement Google Cloud’s existing strengths in security. Together with Mandiant, Google Cloud will deliver an end-to-end security operations suite with even greater capabilities as well as advisory services helping customers address critical security challenges and stay protected at every stage of the security lifecycle.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>“Cyber security is a mission, and we believe it’s one of the most important of our generation. Google Cloud shares our mission-driven culture to bring security to every organization,” said Kevin Mandia, CEO, Mandiant. “Together, we will deliver our expertise and intelligence at scale via the Mandiant Advantage SaaS platform, as part of the Google Cloud security portfolio. These efforts will help organizations to effectively, efficiently and continuously manage and configure their complex mix of security products.”</span></span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>“The Mandiant brand is synonymous with unmatched insights for organizations seeking to keep themselves secure in a constantly changing environment,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO, Google Cloud. “This is an opportunity to deliver an end-to-end security operations suite and extend one of the best consulting organizations in the world. Together we can make a profound impact in securing the cloud, accelerating the adoption of cloud computing, and ultimately make the world safer.”</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of Mandiant stockholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close later this year. Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. LLC is acting as exclusive financial advisor, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati P.C. is acting as legal advisor to Mandiant.

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Mandiant, Inc.
