        <p><i>Daily dispatches from my 12 weeks at the Recurse Center in Summer 2023
</i></p>
        
        <p>I spent a lot of time today drawing out various logic gates schematics. Too much time. I hadn’t known that <code>NAND</code> logic is so magical and that it’s possible to derive all other logic gates from combinations of <code>NAND</code>s, but now that I do I can’t get enough <code>NAND</code>.</p>

<p>Besides drawing logic diagrams, the other thing I started today was SICP.</p>

<p>Actually, before I cracked the book I had to get my Scheme environment up and running. One of my group mates recommended <a href="https://download.racket-lang.org/releases/8.9/doc/drracket/index.html">DrRacket</a> which allows you to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/">run the version of Scheme used in the SICP book</a>. But I ended up going <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/">MIT/GNU Scheme</a>, which thus far suits me. Is it because of the Latin sign-offs when halting with <code>(exit)</code>? I won’t say. All I know is that, between the sorcery talk (“In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells”) and the calamitous quips from Cato the Elder (“Furthermore, I consider that Carthage must be destroyed”), I’m feeling like I’ve just embarked on a proper quest.</p>

<p>Here’s what else happened:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Checkins</li>
  <li>Finished first week’s problem set for #nand2tetris</li>
  <li>Became so enmeshed in drawing logic diagrams that I was late to a meeting with an RC career counselor, who encouraged my near-term plans</li>
  <li>Made it through almost two LeetCode problems with the Neetcode group</li>
  <li>Met some new folks</li>
</ul>
