        <p>jamcorder is a transformative new way to record your piano.
            truly set &amp; forget, you never need to hit record.
            instead, just open the app and all your music is already there.
            and we mean <em>all of it</em>.
            jamcorder stores 25,000 hours of music
            — around 3 <em>straight</em> years 
            — right out of the box.
            so you can focus on playing and just jam away.

        <h2>great for improv, practicing, composing</h2>
        <p>
           jamcorder is great for capturing your improptu improvisations, letting you play freely.

           you can track how much you practice, review your playing,
           and share recordings with friends, family, and teachers.

           it captures every stroke of genius,
           so you can turn serendipitous ideas into finished compositions.

        <h2>how it works</h2>
        <p>unlike most recorders, jamcorder doesn’t capture audio. 
            instead, jamcorder plugs into your piano via midi, and transcribes every note you play — including its strength — in midi format.

            these recordings sync to your phone via bluetooth,
            or can be accessed via sd card.

            this music format is tiny, letting 12 hours of music fit in the same space as one smartphone photo.

        <h2>faq</h2>

        <div>
            <h3>why record everything? <span>►</span></h3>
            <p>
                recording everything allows you to scroll back to any moment in time,
                letting you focus on playing, not the record button.
                you can always manually delete old recordings, if desired.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>can i stop recording? <span>►</span></h3>
            <p>
                yes, simply unplug it.
                but it&#39;s recommended you instead shift your thinking — 
                focus on playing, not recording, and use bookmarks.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>will recordings have long silences? <span>►</span></h3>
            <p>
                no. jamcorder stops recording after 3 seconds of piano silence,
                and resumes immediately when you start playing, with no lost notes.
                the original silences can also be &#39;restored&#39; later, if desired.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>how will i find the recordings i care about? <span>►</span></h3>
            <p>
                jamcorder is the opposite of a traditional recorder.
                instead of <em>before</em>, with jamcorder you mark music <em>after</em> you record it
                by leaving bookmarks and adding it to an album.
                </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>why not just use my phone? <span>►</span></h3>
            <p>
                phones are a great option for occasional recording, but
                they don&#39;t record automatically, 
                they don&#39;t show the notes you played,
                they don&#39;t track your playing history.
                inspired by the convenience of a phone, jamcorder is a natural step up.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>can i upgrade the storage? <span>►</span></h3>
            <p>
                yes. just pop in a larger card. for example, a 64GB card would record 100,000 hours, 11 straight years.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>do i need to use the app? <span>►</span></h3>
            <p>
                no. you can also access your recordings directly from the sd card.
                and by using <a href="http://tinylogger.com/max/wifi-setup.html">wifi setup</a> you can
                do things like set the date &amp; time without the app.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>can i convert to sheet music? <span>►</span></h3>
            <p>
                of course. first, export your recording as midi.
                then use a 3rd party tool such as <a href="https://melobytes.com/en/app/midi2sheet">melobytes</a> to convert it to sheet music.
            </p>
        </div>
    
        <div>
            <h3>can multiple people share the same piano? <span>►</span></h3>
            <p>
                totally fine. however, your recordings will be mixed together.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>i have multiple pianos <span>►</span></h3>
            <p>
                the app supports multiple pianos. either connect a jamcorder to each piano, 
                or combine the midi signals into a single cable.
            </p>
