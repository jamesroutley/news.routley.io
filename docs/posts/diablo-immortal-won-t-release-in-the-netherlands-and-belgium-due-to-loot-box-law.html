<p>The launch for <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/diablo-immortal/" target="_top" rel="noopener">Diablo Immortal</a> is getting ever closer, and while many fans around the world are probably getting ready to dive into Sanctuary on their mobile devices, players living in the Netherlands and Belgium won&#39;t be part of that list.</p><p>And that&#39;s because Diablo Immortal will not be launching in both of those countries due to the law that restricts gambling and loot boxes in video games.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-05-30-diablo-immortal-wont-launch-in-two-countries-due-to-loot-box-legislation" target="_blank">Gamesindustry.biz</a> reports, Activision Blizzard&#39;s Benelux communication manager has said (via <a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/196722/diablo-immortal-komt-niet-uit-in-nederland-en-belgie.html" target="_blank">Tweakers</a>) that &#34;the current operating conditions in these countries&#34; is the reason for the decision.</p><p>While this doesn&#39;t directly mention loot boxes as the reason for this development, a follow up statement by another Blizzard employee on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DiabloImmortal/comments/uw1hwu/for_the_people_wondering_about_belgium_the/" target="_blank">Diablo Immortal&#39;s subreddit</a> has added that &#34;The lootboxes in the game are against the law in your country, so unless the gambling restrictions change, the game will not be released in the Netherlands and Belgium&#34;.</p><p>The post also went a step further to add that Blizzard cannot guarantee that anyone who plays the game in these countries won&#39;t be banned for doing so, due to this legislation.</p><figure><p><a href="http://harihareswara.net/images/?textid=1087853&amp;id=2644763" rel="nofollow"><img data-original="https://www.gamereactor.eu/media/47/_2644763.jpg" src="http://harihareswara.net/lay/i.gif" width="650" height="217" alt="Diablo Immortal"/></a></p></figure></div></div>
