    <h1>A visual introduction to machine learning</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main">
	<div id="intro">

				<p>In machine learning, computers apply <strong>statistical learning</strong> techniques to automatically identify patterns in data. These techniques can  be used to make highly accurate predictions.</p>
				<p><em>Keep scrolling.</em> Using a data set about homes, we will create a machine learning model to distinguish homes in New York from homes in San Francisco. </p>
			</div>
			
			<hr/>
			<div id="first-two">
				<h2> First, some intuition </h2>
				<p> Let’s say you had to determine whether a home is in <strong> San Francisco</strong> or in <strong>New York</strong>. In machine learning  terms, categorizing data points is a <strong>classification</strong> task. </p>
				<p> Since San Francisco is relatively hilly, the elevation of a home may be a good way to distinguish the two cities. </p>
				<p> Based on the home-elevation data to the right, you could argue that a home above 73 meters should be <strong> classified</strong> as one in San Francisco. </p>
			</div>
			<hr/>
			<div id="add-nuance">
				<h2> Adding nuance </h2>
				<p> Adding another <strong>dimension</strong> allows for more nuance. For example, New York apartments can be extremely expensive per square foot. </p>
				<p> So visualizing elevation <em>and</em> price per square foot in a <strong>scatterplot</strong> helps us distinguish lower-elevation homes. </p>
				<p> The data suggests that, among homes at or below 73 meters, those that cost more than $19,116.7 per square meter are in New York City. </p>
				<p> Dimensions in a data set are called <strong>features</strong>, <strong>predictors</strong>, or <strong>variables</strong>. </p>
			</div>
			<hr/>
			<div id="set-boundaries">
				<h2> Drawing boundaries </h2>
				<p> You can visualize your elevation (&gt;73 m) and price per square foot (&gt;$19,116.7) observations as the boundaries of regions in your scatterplot. Homes plotted in the green and blue regions would be in San Francisco and New York, respectively. </p>
				<p> Identifying boundaries in data using math is the essence of statistical learning. </p>
				<p> Of course, you’ll need additional information to distinguish homes with lower elevations <em>and</em> lower per-square-foot prices. </p>
			</div>
			<hr/>
			<div id="more-variables">
				
				<div id="listing-the-variables">
					<!--<div id="data-table"></div>-->
				<p> The dataset we are using to create the model has 7 different dimensions. Creating a model is also known as <strong>training</strong> a model. </p>
				<p> On the right, we are visualizing the variables in a <strong>scatterplot matrix</strong> to show the relationships between each pair of dimensions. </p>
				<p> There are clearly patterns in the data, but the boundaries for delineating them are not obvious. </p>
				</div>
				<div id="from-boundaries-to-pattern">
				<hr/>

				<h2> And now, machine learning </h2>
				<p> Finding patterns in data is where machine learning comes in. Machine learning methods use statistical learning to identify boundaries. </p>
				<p> One example of a machine learning method is a <strong>decision tree</strong>. Decision trees look at one variable at a time and are a reasonably accessible (though rudimentary) machine learning method. </p>
				</div>

				<hr/>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div id="split">
		<div>
			<div id="elevation-to-histogram">
				<hr/>
				<h2> Finding better boundaries </h2>
				<p> Let&#39;s revisit the 73-m elevation boundary proposed previously to see how we can improve upon our intuition. </p>
				<p> Clearly, this requires a different perspective.  </p>
				<hr/>
				<p> By transforming our visualization into a <strong>histogram</strong>, we can better see how frequently homes appear at each elevation. </p>
				<p> While the highest home in New York is 73m, the majority of them seem to have far lower elevations. </p>

			</div>
			<div id="introduce-split">
				<hr/>
				<h2>Your first fork</h2>
				<p> A decision tree uses if-then statements to define patterns in data. </p>
				<p> For example, <strong>if</strong> a home&#39;s elevation is above some number, <strong>then</strong> the home is probably in San Francisco. </p>

			</div>
			<div id="explain-gini">
				<hr/>
				<p> In machine learning, these statements are called <strong>forks</strong>, and they split the data into two <strong>branches</strong> based on some value. </p>
				<p> That value between the branches is called a <strong>split point</strong>. Homes to the left of that point get categorized in one way, while those to the right are categorized in another. A split point is the decision tree&#39;s version of a boundary. </p>

				<hr/>
				<h2>Tradeoffs</h2>
				<p> Picking a split point has tradeoffs. Our initial split (~73 m) incorrectly classifies some San Francisco homes as New York ones. </p>
				<p> Look at that large slice of green in the left pie chart, those are all the San Francisco homes that are misclassified. These are called <strong>false negatives</strong>. </p>

				<hr/>
				<p> However, a split point meant to capture every San Francisco home will include many New York homes as well. These are called <strong>false positives</strong>. </p>
				<hr/>

				<h2>The best split</h2>
				<p> At the <strong>best split</strong>, the results of each branch should be as homogeneous (or pure) as possible. There are several mathematical methods you can choose between to calculate the best split.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>As we see here, even the best split on a single feature does not fully separate the San Francisco homes from the New York ones.</p>
				<hr/>
			</div>
			<div id="further-split">
				<hr/>
				<h2>Recursion</h2>
				<p>To add another split point, the algorithm repeats the process above on the subsets of data. This repetition is called <strong>recursion</strong>, and it is a concept that appears frequently in training models.</p>

				<p>The histograms to the left show the distribution of each subset, repeated for each variable.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The best split will vary based which branch of the tree you are looking at.</p> 
				<p>For lower elevation homes, price per square foot is, at $1061 per sqft, is the best variable for the next if-then statement. For higher elevation homes, it is price, at $514,500</p><p>.

	<div id="tree">

			<div class="tracking-section">
				<hr/>
				<h2>Growing a tree</h2>
				<p>Additional forks will add new information that can increase a tree&#39;s <strong>prediction accuracy</strong>.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Splitting one layer deeper, the tree&#39;s accuracy improves to <strong>84%</strong>.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Adding several more layers, we get to <strong>96%</strong>.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>You could even continue to add branches until the tree&#39;s predictions are <strong>100% accurate</strong>, so that at the end of every branch, the homes are purely in San Francisco or purely in New York.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="tracking-section">
				<hr/>
				<p>These ultimate branches of the tree are called <strong>leaf nodes</strong>. Our decision tree models will classify the homes in each leaf node according to which class of homes is in the majority.</p>
				<hr/>
			</div>

		</div>
	</div>
	<div id="test">
		<div>
			<div id="classify-training-data">
				<hr/>
				<h2>Making predictions</h2>
				<p>The newly-trained decision tree model determines whether a home is in San Francisco or New York by running each data point through the branches.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Here you can see the data that was used to train the tree flow through the tree.</p>

				<p>This data is called <strong>training data</strong> because it was used to train the model.</p>

				<hr/>
				<p>Because we grew the tree until it was 100% accurate, this tree maps each training data point perfectly to which city it is in.</p>

			</div>
			<div id="classify-test-data">
				<hr/>
				<h2>Reality check</h2>
				<p>Of course, what matters more is how the tree performs on previously-unseen data.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>To <strong>test</strong> the tree&#39;s performance on new data, we need to apply it to data points that it has never seen before. This previously unused data is called <strong>test data</strong>.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Ideally, the tree should perform similarly on both known and unknown data.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>So this one is less than ideal.</p>
				<hr/>

			</div>
			<div id="misclassification">

				<p>These errors are due to <strong>overfitting</strong>. Our model has learned to treat every detail in the training data as important, even details that turned out to be irrelevant.</p>

				<p>Overfitting is part of a fundamental concept in machine learning explained in our next post.</p>

				<h2>Recap</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Machine learning identifies patterns using <strong>statistical learning</strong> and computers by unearthing <strong>boundaries</strong> in data sets. You can use it to make predictions.</li>					
					<li>One method for making predictions is called a decision trees, which uses a series of if-then statements to identify boundaries and define patterns in the data.</li>
					<li><strong>Overfitting</strong> happens when some boundaries are based on on <em>distinctions that don&#39;t make a difference</em>. You can see if a model overfits by having test data flow through the model.</li>
