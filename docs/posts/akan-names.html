<p>Content Warning: IBS, chronic illness, suicide, mental health</p>
<p>Around 20 years ago I caught a virus and since then my gut has somehow become disconnected from my brain. I feel permanent discomfort (or, as I have recently learned, actual pain). It will wake me up at night when it&#39;s bad. A lot of the food I used to like (vegetables, tofu, garlic, onions, â€¦) make things exponentially worse. It took about 3 months for suicide to become a real possibility (tbf I wasn&#39;t starting from zero here). It is a constant companion.</p>
<p>In the first year, I went to dozens of doctors and had exams and scans done and samples taken and whatever. Everything came back normal. I skipped suicide by cleverly tricking myself, but the constant pain threw life completely off the rails. I was obsessed with finding a solution, trying all kinds of diets, and it being about digestion and the gut, everybody had something to say about the matter, since everybody deals with it at times.</p>
<p>It took me two more years of saying &#34;fuck it, this is the way it is now, let&#39;s move on&#34;, which actually worked.  Hope is one of the most cruel emotions, and I was glad I could banish it so easily. That&#39;s what I think the IBS label is for: allow closure and give hope a decent ending. My life was still a mess due to a host of other reasons. Through all of it, psychotic mania, substance abuse, moving to another continent, good times and bad times, one thing stayed constant: the IBS.</p>
<p>Over time, I started to identify more and more trigger foods so that I could finally reach some kind of relaxing baseline. I can subsist on bread and meat and sweets. I can venture out to eat other food, knowing that I&#39;ll be able to return to an almost relaxing state within a few days.</p>
<p>The one thing that reliably allows me to forget about my gut is doing something that captures my full attention, especially if there is a physical component to it. These things are: playing an instrument, making music with my synthesizers, programming, riding my bike, playing video games. So that&#39;s what I try to do, from morning to evening.</p>
<p>People often tell me: do you ever stop?  I don&#39;t, because &#34;not stopping&#34; is what allows me to stop. Sure, I want to feel productive, and I stress about it as much as the next person. But constantly trying to lose myself in something? It is about finding peace and quiet amidst the pain.</p>
<p>I have been reading a lot of accounts of disabled people lately and these are stories not heard. I haven&#39;t found much personal experiences around IBS, it is invisible, in fact living with it is trying to make it invisible to yourself. Talking about it invites so much well-meant advice, when the last thing you want is advice (some of it might even be the solution! hope!) because that way lies despair.</p>
<p>So there you go.</p>
