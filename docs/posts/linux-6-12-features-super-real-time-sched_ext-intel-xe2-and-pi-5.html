<p>The <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/search/Linux+6.12">Linux 6.12</a> merge window is  wrapping up today with the release of Linux 6.12-rc1 in the coming hours. This is going to be a heck of an exciting kernel. There&#39;s real-time PREEMPT_RT finally in mainline, the much anticipated sched_ext code also was merged, QR codes for DRM panic messages, initial out-of-the-box support for Intel Xe2 graphics with Lunar Lake and Battlemage, initial Raspberry Pi 5 support, and a ton of other hardware support additions and new innovative kernel software features.</p>
<p>Linux 6.12 is destined to be one of the biggest kernel feature releases in likely some years. Linux 6.12 is bringing PREEMPT_RT for mainline real-time kernel support! Sched_ext was merged for allowing this new scheduling class and scheduling policies to be implemented via BPF programs. QR codes for DRM panic messages was merged in Linux 6.12 as another interesting innovation. The QR code error messages is written in the Rust programming language.</p>
<p>Intel Xe2 graphics with Core Ultra 200 Series &#34;Lunar Lake&#34; and upcoming Battlemage discrete GPUs are enabled by default with Linux 6.12. Some other interesting Linux 6.12 features include LOCALIO support for NFS to deliver an &#34;extreme&#34; performance boost, Multi-Path PCI for the NVIDIA Mellanox driver, VFS+XFS changes to support block sizes larger than the page size, Device Memory TCP support is introduced, IO_uring async discard, and initial Raspberry Pi 5 support.</p>

<p>Below is a more exhaustive list of the Linux 6.12 kernel changes that I have been monitoring. Linux 6.12-rc1 will be out later today and then it&#39;s onto more Linux 6.12 kernel testing and performance benchmarking.</p>
<p>Making Linux 6.12 all the more exciting is that Linux 6.12 is expected to be this year&#39;s Long Term Support (LTS) kernel version. Linux 6.12 stable should be out in mid to late November.</p>
