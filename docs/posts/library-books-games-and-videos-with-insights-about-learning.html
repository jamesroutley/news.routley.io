Each student would work with gradually increasing amounts of autonomy and on projects of increasing scale. They wanted every graduate to have completed a 1,000 hour project.</p><p>The plan ended up being rejected by the committe but some of its authors are currently exploring their ideas at <a href="https://www.powderhouse.org/" target="_blank">Powderhouse</a>.

She dedicated the remaining 45 years of her career to developing her ideas on learning through the Montessori schools, focusing primarily on ages 2.5 through 12. This is a notable practical example of work on learning that was the product of a singular cohesive vision of a single individual over an extensive period of time.</p><p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639260-montessori" target="_blank">Montessori: The Science Behind the Genius</a> investigated nine of her principles and found that they are quite consistent with the findings of modern research.</p><div><div id="lillard-montessori"><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639260-montessori" target="_blank"><img height="499" src="https://rigdern.github.io/a/learning-about-learning/library/cover-art/2016-lillard-montessori_thumbnail.jpg" width="333"/></a></p><div><p>The Science Behind the Genius</p><p>by Angeline Stoll Lillard</p><div><div><p>The book distills nine principles from the design of Montessori schools such as an emphasis on the child&#39;s interests and an avoidance of extrinsic rewards. It dedicates an entire chapter to each principle and what modern research has to say about it. Lastly, it describes the studies that do the best job of investigating the overall effectiveness of Montessori schools.</p><p>The author has also presented her ideas as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH8gs_zynfjwkPy0LpTdoklnTflqg41AB" target="_blank">a series of talks</a>.</p></div></div></div></div><div id="kramer-maria-montessori"><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/255829.Maria_Montessori" target="_blank"><img height="475" src="https://rigdern.github.io/a/learning-about-learning/library/cover-art/1976-kramer-maria-montessori_thumbnail.jpg" width="314"/></a></p><div><p>A Biography</p><p>by Rita Kramer</p><p>This biography taught me what Maria Montessori did and why which was helpful context for understanding the ideas in Montessori schools.</p></div></div></div><h2>Design</h2><p>The way that information and skills are represented impacts how easy they are to learn. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_ten_block" target="_blank">base 10 blocks</a> and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipulative_(mathematics_education)" target="_blank">manipulatives</a> are used in the learning of mathematics. Consequently, it&#39;s interesting to study disciplines that focus on designing representations. In particular, I find these to be relevant:</p><ul><li><b>Graphic design</b> is the art of conveying a message on a two-dimensional surface. <span>(from <a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#p67" target="_blank">Magic Ink</a>)</span></li><li><b>Industrial design</b> is the art of arranging and shaping a physical product so it can be manipulated by a person. <span>(from <a href="http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/#p69" target="_blank">Magic Ink</a>)</span></li><li><b>Interaction design</b> is the art of designing the behavior of complex interactive systems. <span>(from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48495224-about-face-4-the-essence-of-interaction-design" target="_blank">About Face</a>)</span></li></ul><div><div id="the-design-of-everyday-things"><p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things" target="_blank"><img height="500" src="https://rigdern.github.io/a/learning-about-learning/library/cover-art/1988-norman-the-design-of-everyday-things_thumbnail.jpg" width="326"/></a></p><div><p>by Donald A.
