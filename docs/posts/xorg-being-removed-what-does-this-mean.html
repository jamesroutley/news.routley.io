  You may have seen the news that <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/rhel-10-plans-wayland-and-xorg-server">Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 plans to remove Xorg</a>. But Xwayland will stay around, and given the name overloading and them sharing a git repository there&#39;s some confusion over what is Xorg. So here&#39;s a very simple &#34;picture&#34;. This is the xserver git repository:

  The git repo produces several X servers, including the one designed to run on bare metal: Xorg (in <i>hw/xfree86</i> for historical reasons). The other <i>hw</i> directories are the other X servers including Xwayland. All the other directories are core X server functionality that&#39;s shared between all X servers [1]. Removing Xorg from a distro but keeping Xwayland means building with <i>--disable-xfree86 -enable-xwayland</i> [1]. That&#39;s simply it (plus the resulting distro packaging work of course).
</p>
<p>Removing Xorg means you need something else that runs on bare metal and that is your favourite Wayland compositor. Xwayland then talks to that while presenting an X11-compatible socket to existing X11 applications.</p>
<p>
  Of course all this means that the X server repo will continue to see patches and many of those will also affect Xorg. For those who are running git master anyway. Don&#39;t get your hopes up for more Xorg releases beyond the security update background noise [2]. 
</p>
<p>
  Xwayland on the other hand is actively maintained and will continue to see releases. But those releases are a sequence [1] of
</p><pre>$ git new-branch xwayland-23.x.y
$ git rm hw/{kdrive/vfb/xfree86/xnest,xquartz,xwin}
$ git tag xwayland-23.x.y
</pre><p> 
In other words, an Xwayland release is the xserver git master branch <i>with all X servers but Xwayland removed</i>. That&#39;s how Xwayland can see new updates and releases without Xorg ever seeing those (except on git master of course). And that&#39;s how your installed Xwayland has code from 2023 while your installed Xorg is still stuck on the branch created and barely updated after 2021.
</p>

<p>I hope this helps a bit with the confusion of the seemingly mixed messages sent when you see headlines like  &#34;Xorg is unmaintained&#34;, &#34;X server patches to fix blah&#34;, &#34;Xorg is abandoned&#34;, &#34;new Xwayland release.</p>
