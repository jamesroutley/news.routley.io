Fru said in the press release.</p><p>The researchers believe that the underwater volcanic environment led the way to &#34;cyanobacterial photosynthesis,&#34; which created a &#34;generation of a large food resource&#34; to enable the formation of complex life.</p><p>Large macroorganism fossils from this period have been the subject of debate by the scientific community, according to Fru, who believes the study&#39;s findings may answer questions surrounding the fossils&#39; origins.</p><p>&#34;This would have provided sufficient energy to promote an increase in body size and greater complex behaviour observed in primitive simple animal-like life forms such as those found in the fossils from this period,” Fru said.</p><p>The complex life forms, however, did not spread globally from the &#34;restricted nature&#34; of the underwater region and eventually died out, according to the study.</p><p>&#34;While the first attempt failed to spread, the second went on to create the animal biodiversity we see on Earth today,&#34; Fru said.</p></div></div></div></div>
