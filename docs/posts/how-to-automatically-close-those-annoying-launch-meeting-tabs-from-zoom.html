    <h1>How to automatically close those annoying “Launch Meeting” tabs from Zoom</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>It&#39;s bad enough that you have five Zoom meetings this morning. Why, when the meetings are done, do you have to come back to a browser with five &#34;Launch Meeting&#34; tabs? </p><div><p><img alt="A screenshot of the &#34;Launch Meeting&#34; Zoom tab that appears after launching a Zoom meeting" src="https://images.ctfassets.net/lzny33ho1g45/4S63WGU7eLMgqT5bKUSxVi/ecd29a7798b942a1ccac5cb8a36e0555/image1.png?w=1400" title="automatically-close-launch-meeting-zoom-tab-01-screenshot"/></p><figcaption></figcaption></div><p>Look: this is far from the biggest problem in the world right now.
