					<p>Dijkstra was one of the reviewers of the fours language proposals which eventually lead to the language Ada: red, green, blue, and yellow (the winning proposal was green). Here are some quotes from each of the reviews:</p>
<p><strong>red</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“the proposal is both advanced and backward in such an incongruous manner that I am baffled”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>green</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“technical incompetence, probably enhanced by dishonesty”</li>
<li>“I tried to reconstruct from the documentation a coherent design philosophy, an effort in which I failed: the mixture between sense and nonsense remained baffling”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>blue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“the blue language is unacceptably complex”</li>
<li>“these documents are a inextricable mixture of technical documentation and salestalk”</li>
<li>“if we see a crazy argument, are we then allowed to conclude that the authors are idiots?”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>yellow</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“an unsalvageable mess”</li>
</ul>
<p>In a conversation with Andrei P. Ershov (Soviet computer scientist), when asked about his view on Ada, Dijkstra commented that “<em>Ada was such a mess that I shuddered at the thought that Western security would depend on it and that I would feel much safer if the Red Army were to adopt it as well.</em>” [EWD1057].</p>
