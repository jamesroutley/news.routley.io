You might </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/09/protestors-nationwide-rally-tell-apple-dont-break-encryption-dont-break-your"><span data-contrast="none">hold a rally</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, </span><a href="https://act.eff.org/"><span data-contrast="none">write to Congress</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">, or </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/diverse-groups-fly-airship-over-nsas-utah-data-center-protest-illegal-internet-spying"><span data-contrast="none">fly a blimp</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> over the NSA. </span><i><span data-contrast="auto">Or</span></i><span data-contrast="auto"> you might use a </span><a href="https://repaer.earth/"><span data-contrast="none">darkly hilarious parody</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> to make your point, like our client Modest Proposals recently did.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> <br/></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Modest Proposals is an activist collective that uses parody and culture jamming to advance environmental justice and other social causes. As part of a </span><a href="https://www.themodestproposals.org/life-offsets.html"><span data-contrast="none">campaign</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> shining a spotlight on the environmental damage and human toll caused by the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry, Modest Proposals invented a company called Repaer. The fake company’s </span><a href="https://repaer.org/"><span data-contrast="none">website</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> offers energy companies the opportunity to purchase “life offsets” that balance the human deaths their activities cause by extending the lives of individuals deemed economically valuable. The website also advertises a “Plasma Pals” program that encourages parents to donate their child’s plasma to wealthy recipients. Scroll down on the homepage a bit, and you’ll see the logos for three (real) LNG companies—Repaer’s “Featured Partners.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">Believe it or not, the companies didn’t like this. (Shocking!) Two of them—TotalEnergies and Equinor—sent our client stern emails threatening legal action if their names and logos weren’t removed from the website. TotalEnergies also sent a demand to the website’s hosting service, Netlify, that got repaer.earth taken offline. That was our cue to get involved.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> <br/></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">We sent <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/eff-letter-totalenergies-re-modest-proposals">letters</a> to both companies, explaining what should be obvious: the website was a noncommercial work of activism, unlikely to confuse any reasonable viewer. Trademark law is about protecting consumers; it’s not a tool for businesses to shut down criticism. We also sent a counternotice to Netlify denying TotalEnergies’ allegations and demanding that repaer.earth be restored.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}"> We wish this were the first time we’ve had to send letters like that, but EFF regularly helps activists and critics push back on bogus </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/09/climate-has-posse-and-so-does-political-satire"><span data-contrast="none">trademark</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> and </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/08/copyright-not-tool-silence-critics-religious-education"><span data-contrast="none">copyright</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/03/sxsw-tried-silence-critics-bogus-trademark-and-copyright-claims-eff-fought-back"><span data-contrast="none">claims</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. This incident is also part of a broader and long-standing pattern of the energy industry weaponizing the law to quash dissent by environmental activists. </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/takedowns/landis-gyr-agrees-leave-documents-then-sends-notice-take-them-down"><span data-contrast="none">These</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-and-eri-fight-quash-speech-chilling-subpoenas-chevron"><span data-contrast="none">are</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/and-another-one-takedown-hall-shame-peabody-energy"><span data-contrast="none">just</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/using-copyright-silence-oil-company-satire-how-crude"><span data-contrast="none">examples</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/05/utah-court-strikes-blow-free-speech-dismisses"><span data-contrast="none">EFF</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/greenpeace-stands-against-slapps-and-wins"><span data-contrast="none">has</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/archives/2010/01/05"><span data-contrast="none">written</span></a> <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/09/its-time-federal-anti-slapp-law-protect-online-speakers"><span data-contrast="none">about</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">. We’ve been fighting these tactics for a long time, both by representing individual activist groups and through supporting legislative efforts like a </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/09/its-time-federal-anti-slapp-law-protect-online-speakers"><span data-contrast="none">federal anti-SLAPP bill</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span><span data-ccp-props="0}"> </span></p>
<p><span data-ccp-props="{}">Frustratingly, Netlify made us go through the full </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca"><span data-contrast="none">DMCA</span></a><span data-contrast="auto"> counternotice process—including a 10-business-day waiting period to have the site restored—even though this was never a DMCA claim. (The DMCA is copyright law, not trademark, and TotalEnergies didn’t even meet the notice requirements that Netlify claims to follow.) Rather than wait around for Netlify to act, Modest Proposals eventually moved the website to a different hosting service.  </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"><br/></span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Equinor and TotalEnergies, on the other hand, have remained silent. This is a pretty common result when we help push back against bad trademark and copyright claims: the rights owners slink away once they realize their bullying tactics won’t work, without actually admitting they were wrong. We’re glad these companies seem to have backed off regardless, but victims of bogus claims deserve more certainty than this.</span></p>
