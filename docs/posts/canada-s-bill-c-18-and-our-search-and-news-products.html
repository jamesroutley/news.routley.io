                    The nature of a search engine is to index websites and provide ranked lists of results to users. This is both a service to consumers searching for a product or information, and to individuals, companies and other providers that offer products and information. Traditionally, users would have to pay for access to such a service and providers would have to pay for listing. But Google has been a pioneer of novel advertising models that have made this free to both consumers and providers.

                    Before search engines were effective on the web, following links from one page to another was the only way of finding material. Search engines make that process far more effective, but they can only do so by using the link structure of the web as their principal input. So links are fundamental to the web.
