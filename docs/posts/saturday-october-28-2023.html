  <p>Added summary to Atom feed. Discussed CSS list spacing. Wrote script for opening current daily log entry.</p>
<h2>Today&#39;s Plan</h2>
<ul>
<li>Whatever I feel like doing. It&#39;s the weekend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding summary to Atom feed</h2>
<p>I had some trouble finding documentation for the Atom format, and the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/feed/">Atom feed validator</a> seems to be down at the moment. I eventually found an example of an Atom feed that used the summary feature by going to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(web_standard)#Example_of_an_Atom_1.0_feed">Atom wikipedia page</a>. It looks like it is just <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code>. I added this tag to my Atom feed. It auto-generates from the page metadata for each log entry.</p>
<h2>Discussing yesterday&#39;s list spacing CSS</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve added the following to the <a href="https://quintenkonyn.recurse.com/projects/quintens-blog/css/">CSS Breakdown</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve created a class <code>.summary-directory</code> for use in my <a href="https://quintenkonyn.recurse.com/log/">Log index</a> so that I can give an easy-to-understand amount of spacing for my long list of entries. Previously, this list was just a list of links with default spacing, which creates <a href="https://seirdy.one/posts/2020/11/23/website-best-practices/#tap-targets">tap targets</a> which are way too close together. In order to increase the spacing of the tap targets and the legibility, I have two strategies:</p>
<p>First, I&#39;ve added summaries to each entry, and have put these on a new line below each link on the index. This (non-link) text helps create a buffer between links even with no styling. It also really helps readability to see a preview of each entry, because my date-titles are cryptic.</p>
<p>Second, I&#39;ve increased the spacing with the following CSS rule. Each entry summary, the thing being selected with <code>.summary-directory p</code> (<code>.summary-directory</code> is on the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>), gets a little space between it and its entry link, and a lot of space between it and the next entry link. This keeps it clear which link it is describing.</p>
<pre><code>.summary-directory p {
  margin-block: 0.5rem 1.5rem;
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<h2>Script for opening today&#39;s log entry</h2>
<p>I would like a script that checks the date, opens today&#39;s log entry if it exists, or generates a new one from a template if it doesn&#39;t yet. I want it to open yesterday&#39;s log entry if it&#39;s before 6am, because midnight is a very awkward time for the date to roll over.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>I have the tiniest prior experience with shell scripting, but not enough to rely on. Here, I&#39;ll collect some tutorial and reference resources I believe I might need to put this script together.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://linuxize.com/post/bash-if-else-statement/">if..else Statement</a></li>
<li><a href="https://tecadmin.net/get-current-date-and-time-in-bash/">Get the current time and date</a></li>
<li><a href="https://raspberrytips.com/display-yesterday-date-linux/">Get yesterday&#39;s date</a> because I was a little confused from date&#39;s man page</li>
<li><a href="https://linuxize.com/post/bash-check-if-file-exists/">Check if a file exists</a></li>
<li><a href="https://linuxize.com/post/bash-append-to-file/">Appending to a file</a></li>
<li><a href="https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-sed-to-find-and-replace-string-in-files/">Find and replace with sed</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.baeldung.com/linux/sed-substitution-variables">Using variables with sed</a> (I learned I needed to use double quotes)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Most of these are from <a href="https://linuxize.com/">Linuxize</a>, which is a pleasant, non-bloated site. A relief from most resources you sift through on Google these days. I&#39;ll be bookmarking it.) <strong>Edit:</strong> Never mind! It has horribly intrusive popup video ads on mobile. Only usable with an ad-blocker, unfortunately. That&#39;s a shame, because the content was helpful!</p>
<h3>Someday: learn more about the shell ecosystem</h3>
<p>I am enamored by all of these tiny, composable programs. The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html">date command</a> is delightfully flexible, yet simple to use. A few months ago I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/"><cite>The Art of Unix Programming (2003)</cite></a> by Eric S. Raymond. It&#39;s a kind of socially-informed history of the UNIX design philosophy, and discusses how those little programs are interfaced. I read the introduction and I&#39;d like to find the time to learn more someday. I think it would be very cool to learn more about why my operating system is the way it is.</p>
<h3>Success!</h3>
<p>I&#39;ve successfully created a wonderful script to achieve all I desire. I will need to write it up tomorrow, because it is very late now.</p>
<h2>Task Ideas</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look into where else a summary should go. Do SEO-type features need me to put it somewhere in the HTML head?</li>
<li>Add a subtle vertical line to block quotes, so that it&#39;s easier to tell that it&#39;s a block quote.</li>
<li>Test Atom feed.</li>
<li>Write about log entry script</li>
</ul>
