	The news is that C64 OS version 1.06 has just been released, March 22, 2024. I&#39;m happy to get
	that out the door, as it frees up my mind to start working on important new cornerstone 
	technologies coming to C64 OS. I&#39;ll start dropping hints about that in the coming weeks.
</p>
<p>
	Version 1.06 is a more modest release than 1.05 or 1.04. But I think that&#39;s okay. 
	v1.06 includes one new Application, three new Utilities and new features and improvements to 
	several existing Apps and Utilities, and even some new low-level features in the KERNAL and
	libraries.
</p>
<p>
	This latest release makes use of a combination of all of the above to provide a handy new 
	feature for users and a potentially powerful and useful feature for developers, when put to 
	creative uses at a low-level. Discussions of just this nature have already been spurred on
	in the developer forums on the C64 OS Discord server.
</p>
<p>
	That feature is: <em>Hidden Files</em>. (But you knew that already from the title of this post.)
</p>
<p>
	Let me give a quick walk through of how hidden files work in C64 OS, some of the pit falls, 
	some of the advantages, etc.
</p>

	If you haven&#39;t yet, go grab the free v1.06 update

<h4>What does the storage device do?</h4>

<p>
	On the Commodore 64 and other 8-bit Commodore machines the storage devices themselves take 
	on the burden of file management. Let&#39;s review what various pieces are handled by the 
	storage device itself. We&#39;ll use the 1541 disk drive as the canonical example.
</p>
<p>
	It has a 6502 CPU, a 16KB ROM chip and rather modest 2KB of RAM. It also has two MOS 6522 VIA 
	chips. The Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA) is essentially a CIA (Complex Interface Adapter)
	like the ones found in the C64, but with some features left out that a disk drive doesn&#39;t need.
</p>
<p>
	It&#39;s what exactly the 1541&#39;s CPU and VIAs <em>do</em> that is interesting. They implement almost 
	everything right down to the nuts and bolts.
