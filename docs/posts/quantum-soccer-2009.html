    <h1>Quantum Soccer (2009)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In the game of Quantum Soccer, the aim is to shape the wave function of a quantum-mechanical “ball” so that the probability of it being inside one of the goals rises above a set threshold.  This is achieved by using the motion of the players to alter the energy spectrum of the wave function:  when a player moves across the field, the energy that this action provides (or absorbs) enables transitions between certain modes of the wave function.  The pairs of modes involved depend on the player’s velocity; the exact rules are spelt out in the <a href="https://www.gregegan.net/BORDER/Soccer/SoccerNotes.html">mathematical details</a>, but it’s easy to experiment using trial and error.</p><div>

  <td rowspan="3">The <b>velocity control</b> sets the <i>x</i>- and <i>y</i>-velocities of a player in metres per second.  Click or drag the mouse on this control to set the velocities, then select a player.  If a player has already been selected, the new velocity will be applied immediately.</td>

  <td>The <b>goal control</b> selects the probability threshold for the ball being inside one of the goals in order to score.</td>

 <tr><td>If the <b>OK sounds</b> option is checked, sounds play when goals are scored.</td>
  <td colspan="2">The <b>demo</b> buttons play scripted demonstrations, in which the two teams cooperate to show how goals can be achieved.  (Real play, of course, would include very different tactics.)</td>
