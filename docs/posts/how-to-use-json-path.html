    <h1>How to Use JSON Path</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      









































































































































































































































































































































































































<p>A few years ago most API designers, developers, and technical writers would have had very little reason to bump into JSONPath, but its starting to get more and more relevant as more tools and standards start relying on it. So what is JSONPath, what is it used for, and how can you get up to speed with using it?</p>

<p>JSONPath is a query language that can be used to extract data from JSON documents, which at first might not sound very exciting, but remember... OpenAPI is just a JSON (or YAML) document, so you can use JSONPath to poke around in OpenAPI and do various things.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/OAI/Overlay-Specification" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath for OpenAPI Overlays</a>, to patch OpenAPI documents with extra documentation content, code samples, or whatever else.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/d3482ff0ccae9-rules#given" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath in Spectral</a> to write incredibly advanced linting rules which can power your <a href="https://apisyouwonthate.com/blog/automated-style-guides-for-rest-graphql-grpc/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">automated API Style Guides</a>.</p>

<p>You can even use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/using-jsonpath-effectively-in-aws-step-functions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath in AWS Step Functions</a>.</p>

<p>JSONPath is popping up all over the the place these days, and if you work with OpenAPI it&#39;s definitely a handy tool to have on your belt.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-jsonpath-work">How does JSONPath Work?</h2>

<p>JSONPath is one of several query languages which will let you filter, query, and traverse through a chunk of JSON, not just to pull bits out, but to navigate complex data structures, with syntax for getting into specific array indexes, filtering through an objects properties or array values before continuing on to its children.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a sample JSONPath from the RFC.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span>.</span><span>store</span><span>.</span><span>book</span><span>[?@.</span><span>price</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>10</span><span>].</span><span>title</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Anyone familiar with XPath in XML will be thinking &#34;hmm, this looks pretty familiar!&#34; and you&#39;re spot on, JSONPath is <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#inspired-by-xpath" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">inspired by XPath</a>. If you&#39;ve never heard of XPath no worries, we&#39;ll start from scratch here.
</p>
<p>To see how this works we&#39;ll need some JSON to run it against, so here is an example of some JSON from the RFC.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;store&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

<p><em>Example JSONPath Expressions and Their Intended Results When Applied to the Example JSON Value, from <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535#name-jsonpath-examples" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RFC 9535: 1.5. JSONPath Examples</a>.</em></p>

<p>By combining these bits of example syntax together you can do amazing and powerful things with JSONPath, so let&#39;s look at how to do those amazing things in OpenAPI.</p>

<h3 id="jsonpath-openapi">JSONPath &amp; OpenAPI</h3>

<p>Take an OpenAPI document, like the <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh-examples/train-travel-api" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Train Travel API</a>.</p>
<div><pre><code>git clone github.com/bump-sh-examples/train-travel-api

<span>cd </span>train-travel-api
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then install <a href="https://www.jsware.io/jsonpath-cli/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">jsonpath-cli</a> just so we can try some things out.</p>
<div><pre><code>npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> @jsware/jsonpath-cli
</code></pre></div>
<p>Optional, if you&#39;re working with YAML, you might want to convert from YAML to JSON in the CLI too.</p>
<div><pre><code>brew <span>install </span>yq

yq <span>eval</span> <span>-o</span><span>=</span>json openapi.yaml <span>&gt;</span> openapi.json
</code></pre></div>
<p>Don&#39;t worry this is just for playing around, all of the tooling that uses JSONPath will support YAML without bodges like this. Let&#39;s just get on the same page for this guide.</p>

<h3 id="querying-openapi-with-jsonpath">Querying OpenAPI with JSONPath</h3>

<p>Once you have a JSON file to work with, we can use the <code>jpp</code> command, pass in a JSON/YAML document, and provide a JSONPath expression to query the document for specific parts.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>jpp <span>--pretty</span> <span>&#39;$.info&#39;</span> openapi.json

<span>[</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>&#34;title&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;Train Travel API&#34;</span>,
    <span>&#34;description&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;API for finding and booking train trips across Europe.&#34;</span>,
    <span>&#34;version&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;1.0.0&#34;</span>,
    <span>&#34;contact&#34;</span>: <span>{</span>
      <span>&#34;name&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;Train Support&#34;</span>,
      <span>&#34;url&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;https://example.com/support&#34;</span>,
      <span>&#34;email&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;<a href="https://jinnycho.github.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f5868085859a8781b5908d9498859990db969a98">[email¬†protected]</a>&#34;</span>
    <span>}</span>,
    <span>&#34;license&#34;</span>: <span>{</span>
      <span>&#34;name&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International&#34;</span>,
      <span>&#34;identifier&#34;</span>: <span>&#34;CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0&#34;</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In this example <code>$</code> refers to the root JSON document, then <code>.info</code> is using dot notation to access the <code>info</code> key in that object.</p>

<p>We can get a bit more advanced, and pull up a list of paths.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>jpp <span>--pretty</span> <span>&#39;$.paths.*~&#39;</span> openapi.json

<span>[</span>
  <span>&#34;/stations&#34;</span>,
  <span>&#34;/trips&#34;</span>,
  <span>&#34;/bookings&#34;</span>,
  <span>&#34;/bookings/{bookingId}&#34;</span>,
  <span>&#34;/bookings/{bookingId}/payment&#34;</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This uses the <code>.*</code> syntax which is basically grabbing all children of the paths object, then using <code>~</code> to grab the keys instead of the values.</p>

<p>What sort of query language would JSONPath be if we could not do queries? Let&#39;s pull up a list of paths which are a <code>get</code> or a <code>post</code>, but ignore all the <code>put</code>, <code>patch</code>, <code>delete</code>, etc.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>$ </span>jpp <span>--pretty</span> <span>&#39;$.paths[?(@.put || @.post)]~&#39;</span> openapi.json

<span>[</span>
  <span>&#34;/bookings&#34;</span>,
  <span>&#34;/bookings/{bookingId}/payment&#34;</span>
<span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="openapi-overlays-powered-by-jsonpath">OpenAPI Overlays powered by JSONPath</h2>

<p>One of the main uses for JSONPath will be for working OpenAPI documents, often by technical writers or other folks in the API governance space to check or improve OpenAPI documents.</p>

<p>Overlays are a list of actions, which make up a &#34;target&#34; which is a JSONPath, and an operation of either &#34;update&#34; or &#34;remove&#34;.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at an update command.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># overlays.yaml</span>

<span>overlay</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0.0</span>
<span>info</span><span>:</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>Overlay to customise API for Protect Earth</span>
  <span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>0.0.1</span>
<span>actions</span><span>:</span>

    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Update description and contact for our audience.</span>
    <span>update</span><span>:</span>
      <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>&gt;</span>
        <span>A new and much more interesting long form description, which has all sorts of</span>
        <span>Markdown, or more specifically [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) which</span>
        <span>is _like_ Markdown but **better**, because it&#39;s an actual standard instead of a</span>
        <span>series of sometimes vaguely consistent conventions.</span>

        <span>Anyway, this is a good place to write all sorts of helpful stuff, link to other</span>
        <span>getting started content, link to where people can find access tokens, or even</span>
        <span>paste some code samples for getting your first API request off the ground.</span>

      <span>contact</span><span>:</span>
        <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>Support Team</span>
        <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://example.com/contact</span>
        <span>email</span><span>:</span> <span><a href="https://jinnycho.github.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="681b1d1818071a1c280d10090518040d46071a0f">[email¬†protected]</a></span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>This overlays file is pointing to the JSONPath target <code>$.info</code>, then updating the object with the new bits of OpenAPI for <code>description</code> and <code>contact</code>, as per the <a href="https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.1.0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OpenAPI specification</a>. This can be handy for improving the quality of all sorts of descriptions, not just info, and for popping in support team contact information if the API developers inevitably forgot to mention that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Instead of using those <code>yq</code> or <code>jpp</code> tools we grabbed just to practice, we can use the <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh/cli" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bump.sh CLI</a> which has support for Overlays built in, and thankfully it&#39;ll work just fine with YAML or JSON.</p>
<div><pre><code>npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> bump-cli

bump overlay openapi.yaml overlays.yaml <span>&gt;</span> openapi.new.yaml
</code></pre></div>
<p>If we were to run that overlay on the Train Travel API, the resulting <code>openapi.new.yaml</code> would like like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>openapi</span><span>:</span> <span>3.1.0</span>
<span>info</span><span>:</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>Train Travel API</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>When combined with more advanced queries you can start to get really specific with bits of the OpenAPI document you&#39;d like to update, enabling all sorts of random use cases like cleaning up the servers list for publishing an API Catalogue, removing Development and Staging servers not accessible or relevant to API consumers.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># openapi.yaml</span>
<span>openapi</span><span>:</span> <span>3.1.0</span>
<span>servers</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>http://localhost:3000</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Development</span>

  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://api-staging.example.com</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Staging</span>

  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://api.example.com</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Production</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>An overlay can target the servers array with <code>$.servers</code> then query through them with <code>$.servers[?(@.description==&#34;Development&#34; || @.description==&#34;Staging&#34;)]</code>, which is looking through objects in the array, and looking through the children for <code>description: Development</code> or <code>description: Staging</code> using basically JavaScript syntax.</p>

<p>The Overlay for this would combine that JSONPath target with <code>remove: true</code> operation like this:</p>
<div><pre><code><span># overlays.yaml</span>
<span>overlay</span><span>:</span> <span>1.0.0</span>
<span>info</span><span>:</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> <span>Overlay to customise API</span>
  <span>version</span><span>:</span> <span>0.0.1</span>
<span>actions</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>target</span><span>:</span> <span>&#39;</span><span>$.servers[?(@.description==&#34;Development&#34;</span><span> </span><span>||</span><span> </span><span>@.description==&#34;Staging&#34;)]&#39;</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Remove Development and Staging servers but leave anything else.</span>
    <span>remove</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>That would leave this resulting OpenAPI.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># openapi.yaml</span>
<span>openapi</span><span>:</span> <span>3.1.0</span>
<span>servers</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>https://api.example.com</span>
    <span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>Production</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Then the Developer Experience folks decide to roll out a Mocking or Sandbox experience, where consumers can play around with requests without actually triggering real emails, real data, or spending real money, but how can we show everyone where that is? Do we have to go and pester all the API teams to add it? Nope, just add another action.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># overlays.yaml</span>

<h3 id="leaning-more-about-jsonpath">Leaning more about JSONPath</h3>

<p>JSONPath made it to IETF &#34;proposed standard&#34; RFC status in 2024 (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9535" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RFC 9535</a>), but before then it was in a similar position to <a href="https://philsturgeon.com/state-of-markdown/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Markdown in the days before CommonMark</a>, in that there are a few different variations of JSONPath as a concept.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://goessner.net/articles/JsonPath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath &#34;The Blog Post&#34;</a> - Written by Stefan G√∂ssner in 2007.</li>
<li><a href="https://jsonpath.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">jsonpath.com</a> - An online evaluator which as far as I can tell matches the blog post.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonpath-plus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath-Plus</a> - A popular (but now abandoned) fork which expands on the original specification to add some additional operators.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nimma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nimma</a> - A fork of JSONPath Plus created by the Stoplight team for Spectral to handle more advanced use cases. A list of caveats can be found here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Then to further compound this confusion, all of the implementations have different support for certain features, and have filled in the grey areas differently due to their own interpretations and community requests. The amazing <a href="https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">JSONPath Comparison project</a> has collated all of the differences into a massive test suite and published the results, which was really helpful in shaping the new standard. Hopefully this will help tools converge, and we can forget all about this incompatibility.</p>

<p>For now, try to follow the RFC 9535 syntax, and use tooling which lines up with that syntax. Unfortunately that means not using <code>jsonpath.com</code>, and even the <code>jpp</code> CLI tool we used earlier is JSONPath Plus, which has a few differences to the RFC...</p>

<p>The Bump.sh CLI <code>overlays</code> functionality is JSONPath RFC 9535 compliant, and if you spot any valid RFC JSONPath syntax not working as expected please <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh/cli/issues" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">create an issue on GitHub</a> so we can get that sorted out.</p>
