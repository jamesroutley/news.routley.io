    <h1>Misguided Apple Intelligence ads</h1>

							<p>Apple apparently hasn’t learned much from the criticism it took earlier this year for an ad showing creative works unceremoniously crushed in an industrial press (see “<a href="https://tidbits.com/2024/05/10/apple-apologizes-for-tone-deaf-crush-ipad-pro-ad/">Apple Apologizes for Tone-Deaf “Crush!” iPad Pro Ad</a>,” 10 May 2024). A pair of new ads for Apple Intelligence portray the Writing Tools and Memories movies as tools for those unwilling to put in any effort.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3m0MoYKwVTM">first ad</a>, Apple Intelligence enables a goof-off who wastes time and annoys his colleagues to surprise his boss with an unexpectedly well-written email. It’s not clear that the boss is impressed; he just can’t believe the guy would have written a professional message.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Apple Intelligence | Writing Tools | iPhone 16" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3m0MoYKwVTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Is the message that Apple Intelligence is aimed at the perpetually lazy? Where’s the positive ad with a dyslexic child using Writing Tools to proofread a school essay or a businessperson using it to understand a complex report dumped on them minutes before a meeting?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0BXZhdDqZM">second ad</a> channels a similar suggestion—that Apple Intelligence is a crutch for the thoughtless. In it, a woman realizes that she has forgotten her husband’s birthday only after their kids give him thoughtful, homemade gifts, so she quickly uses Apple Intelligence to create a Memories movie of the children doing woodworking with their father. Apple Intelligence to the rescue! Apparently, making a Memories movie is easier than creating a repeating annual calendar event.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Apple Intelligence | Create memory movies | iPhone 16" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0BXZhdDqZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Why would Apple want to promote the idea that Apple Intelligence can bail you out from failing to pay attention to the most important people in your life? It’s trivially easy to imagine positive scenarios enhanced by a Memories movie, such as a teen sharing photos with an ailing grandparent in the hospital or high school friends reconnecting over shared sports photos. They might be a touch cloying, but Memories movies trend in that direction anyway.</p>
<p>As it stands now, and likely as it will be in its next release, Apple Intelligence won’t change the world or even your everyday Mac experience. But it can make a difference for some, and Apple would be better served by showing it helping those who are already trying to do good work and be good people.</p>
<p>Imagine you work at Apple’s ad agency. What ads would you like to see showcasing Apple Intelligence features?</p>
