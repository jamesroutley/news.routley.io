    <h1>Placemark is going open source and shutting down</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.placemark.io/post/placemark-is-winding-down"><em>also on placemark.io/blog</em></a></p><p>The company and product side of <a href="https://www.placemark.io/">Placemark</a> didn’t work out. Some fantastic, friendly people used it, but I couldn’t find a way to make it work as a sustainable bootstrapped startup. Building it was incredibly fun. Failing to find success and sustainability was pretty hard but it’s okay.</p><h3 id="heres-the-plan">Here’s the plan:</h3><ul><li>Today I’m turning off signups to Placemark.io.</li><li>Placemark is free for all existing customers until January 19, 2024, at which point the servers will be shut down.</li><li>Later in January, I’ll release the full source code to the site. This might take a little while. It’s a big application.</li></ul><p>Building Placemark was an incredible experience. I learned a ton and got to know a lot of new people in the process. I’m really proud of what it turned out to be, even if the business fell short of my goals.</p><p>I built, coded, designed, documented, marketed, and ran Placemark. It had paying customers who used it for real-world purposes. It shipped, and it was a real business. With luck, it’ll become something as an open source project – either maintained, or used as inspiration and fuel for future projects. I’m happy to create more value than I capture.</p><p>There’s more to write about what I learned, but for now I just want to say thanks to everyone who gave it a shot, and all of the people who were supportive along the way - special thanks to <a href="https://www.agropatterns.com/">Gabriel Coch</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/aboodman">Aaron Boodman</a>, <a href="https://brianlovin.com/">Brian Lovin</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrkrebs/">Adam Krebs</a>, Prerna Nadathur, and many others.</p></div></div>
