    <h1>Put Your Runbook in Your README</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="outline-text-headline-7">
<p>
If the README is among the highest-impact, most discoverable places to document workflows, why don&#39;t we put our scripts there? The typical marquee reason is that READMEs are non-executable: they&#39;re prose, not code. This makes them suffer in the critical &#34;specificity&#34; criterion for runbook technology. Enter <code>xc</code>, the task runner for your README that works seamlessly with your CI, shell, and editor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>xc</code> is a task runner similar to Make or npm run, that aims to be more discoverable and approachable</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To use it, take all the commands you run to build, debug, test &amp; deploy and document them in your README as code blocks, each under a descriptive header, like &#34;Build&#34;. Then run <code>xc build</code> and it&#39;ll find that header in your docs and run the code block there.</p>
<p>
Crucially, put your CI steps in your README and run them on each merge or release. Quality of life here is good: it supports dependencies between blocks, script arguments and plenty more.</p>
<p>
You can also include usage instructions, caveats, deprecation notices, links, and other context right there next to the task&#39;s script. And it&#39;ll actually look nice, since you have all the info presentation tools normally available in READMEs at your disposal, instead of just spartan code comments.</p>

Is it any good?

<p>
Yes! I&#39;ve found <code>xc</code> especially nice to use:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#39;s a single small binary that adds practically zero runtime overhead.</li>
<li>It supports both Markdown and org-mode READMEs.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t have to export tasks into local scripts and then run them. There&#39;s just one step: execute.</li>
<li>The niceties you&#39;d expect are all there: shell completion, CI and IDE integration, and an interactive TUI mode.</li>
</ol>
