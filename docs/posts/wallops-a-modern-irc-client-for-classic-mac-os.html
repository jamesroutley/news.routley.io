					<p>Wallops is a modern IRC client that I wrote on and for my
						<a href="https://jcs.org/system6c">Macintosh Plus</a>.
						It is written for System 6 and should run on newer classic Mac OS versions.</p>
					<p>It requires MacTCP and supports multiple connections, channels, and query
						windows in a tabbed interface.
						When run under MultiFinder, it can run in the background using Notification
						Manager to flash the Apple menu icon when one&#39;s nick is mentioned while the
						window is hidden.</p>
					<p>Wallops is
						<a href="https://amendhub.com/jcs/wallops/files/LICENSE">free software</a>
						and its
						<a href="https://amendhub.com/jcs/wallops">source code</a>
						is available under an ISC license.
						I also have some
						<a href="https://jcs.org/system6c">videos</a>
						about its development and C programming on System 6 in general.</p>

					<h2 id="latest-update-wallops-20-released-2024-09-12">Latest Update: <a href="https://jcs.org/2024/09/12/wallops2">Wallops 2.0 Released</a> (2024-09-12)</h2>
					<p>Another large update to my
						<a href="https://jcs.org/wallops">Wallops IRC client</a>
						is available:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://jcs.org/wallops/wallops-2.0.sit">wallops-2.0.sit</a> (StuffIt 3 archive, includes
							source code and THINK C 5 project file)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>This release features an overhaul of the interface bringing tabs allowing
						multiple channels and private message queries, including a number of other new
						features and bugfixes:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Support window resizing, using an initial window size based on the screen size</li>
						<li>Connect-time settings (server, nick, password, etc.) are now saved to a
							preferences file in the System folder, rather than as resources on the binary
							itself; this prevents accidental sharing of saved passwords and avoids having
							to re-enter settings every time the software is updated</li>
						<li>Add per-user queries which simplify private messaging back and forth with a
							single user; can be opened with <code>/query &lt;user&gt;</code> or by double-clicking a user
							in a channel nick list</li>
						<li>Much improved tab and window redrawing</li>
						<li>Optimize nick list sorting and building, especially on large channels; on a
							large channel with 750 users, this operation went from 62 seconds to 33 on a
							Mac Plus</li>
						<li>Only auto-scroll a message buffer to new messages when not scrolled to the
							bottom, making it easier to read old messages on busy channels</li>
						<li>Implement support for many more server numerics and commands</li>
						<li>Implement additional commands like <code>/clear</code>, <code>/op</code>, <code>/umode</code>, and
							<code>/disconnect</code> (the full list is in the
							<a href="https://amendhub.com/jcs/wallops/files/README"><code>README</code></a>)</li>
						<li>Add global menu options to suppress channel &#34;junk&#34; such as joins, quits/parts,
							and nick changes</li>
						<li>Make Desk Accessories work from the Apple Menu</li>
						<li>Do case-insensitive matching of slash commands</li>
						<li>Add a setting to suppress MOTD printing which can speed up connections on
							slower machines, since MOTDs can be very long on some servers</li>
						<li>Add a custom about dialog</li>
					</ul>
