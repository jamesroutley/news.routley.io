    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_92_969"><div><p>The Chittagong Port Authority (CPA) has detected two containers with the same number in its yards.</p><p>Both the 40-foot containers are bearing the same number: SLHU4500470. However, the boxes are bearing two separate seals: 001535 and GTS 005946.</p><p>The Container Terminal Management System (CTMS) of the port detected the boxes, which were kept under the port’s security arrangement.</p><p>Port officials said that one of the two containers may contain computer accessories while the other one may have solar photovoltaic water pump.</p><p>The CPA has called the shipping agent, and customs authority to decide on the next actions. CPA spokesman, Omar Faruk said such an event has not occurred in the past in Chittagong.</p><p>He added that the customs officials will open the containers, which are owned by Singapore-headquartered shipping company Sea Lloyd.</p><p>Company’s Bangladesh Office General Manager, S M Salam noted that the mistake occurred when containers were made for Sea Lloyd in China.</p><p>“We have asked the manufacturer to give a report on what has led to the wrong-numbering of containers,” he told <em>Container News</em>.</p><p>Salam said that it is not possible to identify the number of boxes with double-up numbers without the report from the Chinese manufacturer.</p><p>“I have never seen two containers carrying the same number in my 27 years of career in the shipping sector,” pointed out Mohammed Abdullah Jahir, chief operating officer of Saif Maritime Ltd, adding that such an incident cannot be detected unless the boxes arrive at the same port at the same time.</p><hr/><p>Sharar Nayel</p></div></div></div>
