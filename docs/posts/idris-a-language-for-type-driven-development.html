<p>Idris is a programming language designed to encourage <em>Type-Driven
Development</em>.</p>
<p>In type-driven development, types are tools for constructing programs.  We
treat the type as the <em>plan</em> for a program, and use the compiler and type
checker as our assistant, guiding us to a complete program that satisfies the
type. The more expressive the type is that we give up front, the more
confidence we can have that the resulting program will be correct.</p>
<p>In Idris, types are first-class constructs in the langauge. This means types
can be passed as arguments to functions, and returned from functions just like
any other value, such as numbers, strings, or lists. This is a small but
powerful idea, enabling:</p>
<ul>
<li>relationships to be expressed between values; for example, that two lists
have the same length.</li>
<li>assumptions to be made explicit and checked by the compiler. For example, if
you assume that a list is non-empty, Idris can ensure this assumption always
holds before the program is run.</li>
<li>if desired, properties of program behaviour to be formally stated and
proven.</li>
</ul>
