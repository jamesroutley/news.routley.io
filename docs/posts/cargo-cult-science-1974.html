<p>Some remarks on science, pseudoscience, and learning how
to not fool yourself. CaltechÕs 1974 commencement address.</p>





<p>During the Middle Ages there were
all kinds of crazy ideas, such as that a piece of rhinoceros horn would
increase potency.<span>Â  </span>(Another crazy
idea of the Middle Ages is these hats we have on todayÑwhich is too loose in my
case.)<span>Â  </span>Then a method was
discovered for separating the ideasÑwhich was to try one to see if it worked,
and if it didnÕt work, to eliminate it.<span>Â 
</span>This method became organized, of course, into science.<span>Â  </span>And it developed very well, so that we
are now in the scientific age.<span>Â  </span>It
is such a scientific age, in fact, that we have difficulty in understanding howÂ­
witch doctors could <i>ever</i><span> have existed,
when nothing that they proposed ever really workedÑor very little of it did.</span></p>



<p>But even today I meet lots of
people who sooner or later get me into a conversation about UFOÕs, or
astrology, or some form of mysticism, expanded consciousness, new types of
awareness, ESP, and so forth.<span>Â  </span>And
IÕve concluded that itÕs <i>not </i><span>a
scientific world.</span></p>



<p>Most people believe so many
wonderful things that I decided to investigate why they did.<span>Â  </span>And what has been referred to as my
curiosity for investigation has landed me in a difficulty where I found so much
junk to talk about that I canÕt do it in this talk.<span>Â  </span>IÕm overwhelmed.<span>Â 
</span>First I started out by investigating various ideas of mysticism, and
mystic experiences.<span>Â  </span>I went into
isolation tanks (theyÕre dark and quiet and you float in Epsom salts) and got
many hours of hallucinations, so I know something about that.<span>Â  </span>Then I went to Esalen, which is a
hotbed of this kind of thought (itÕs a wonderful place; you should go visit there).
Then I became overwhelmed. I didnÕt realize how <i>much </i><span>there was.</span></p>



<p>I was sitting, for example, in a
hot bath and thereÕs another guy and a girl in the bath.<span>Â  </span>He says to the girl, ÒIÕm learning
massage and I wonder if I could practice on you?Ó<span>Â  </span>She says OK, so she gets up on a table and he starts off on
her footÑworking on her big toe and pushing it around.<span>Â  </span>Then he turns to what is apparently his
instructor, and says, ÒI feel a kind of dent.<span>Â  </span>Is that the pituitary?Ó<span>Â  </span>And she says, ÒNo, thatÕs not the way it feels.Ó I say,
ÒYouÕre a hell of a long way from the pituitary, man.Ó<span>Â  </span>And they both looked at meÑI had blown
my cover, you seeÑand she said, ÒItÕs reflexology.Ó<span>Â  </span>So I closed my eyes and appeared to be meditating.</p>



<p>ThatÕs just an example of the
kind of things that overwhelm me.<span>Â 
</span>I also looked into extrasensory perception and PSI phenomena, and the
latest craze there was Uri Geller, a man who is supposed to be able to bend
keys by rubbing them with his finger.<span>Â 
</span>So I went to his hotel room, on his invitation, to see a 
demonstration of
both mind reading and bending keys.<span>Â 
</span>He didnÕt do any mind reading that succeeded; nobody can read my mind, I
guess.<span>Â  </span>And my boy held a key and
Geller rubbed it, and nothing happened.<span>Â 
</span>Then he told us it works better under water, and so you can picture all
of us standing in the bathroom with the water turned on and the key under it,
and him rubbing the key with his finger.<span>Â 
</span>Nothing happened.<span>Â  </span>So I was
unable to investigate that phenomenon.</p>



<p>But then I began to think, what
else is there that we believe?<span>Â 
</span>(And I thought then about the witch doctors, and how easy it would have
been to check on them by noticing that nothing really worked.)<span>Â  </span>So I found things that even more people
believe, such as that we have some knowledge of how to educate.<span>Â  </span>There are big schools of reading methods
and mathematics methods, and so forth, but if you notice, youÕll see the
reading scores keep going downÑor hardly going upÑin spite of the fact that we
continually use these same people to improve the methods.<span>Â  </span><i>ThereÕs</i><span> a witch doctor remedy that doesnÕt work.<span>Â  </span>It ought to be looked into: how do they know that their
method should work?<span>Â  </span>Another
example is how to treat criminals.<span>Â 
</span>We obviously have made no progressÑlots of theory, but no progressÑin
decreasing the amount of crime by the method that we use to handle criminals.</span></p>



<p>Yet these things are said to be scientific.<span>Â  </span>We study them.<span>Â  </span>And I think ordinary people with
commonsense ideas are intimidated by this pseudoscience.<span>Â  </span>A teacher who has some good idea of how
to teach her children to read is forced by the school system to do it some
other wayÑor is even fooled by the school system into thinking that her method
is not necessarily a good one.<span>Â  </span>Or
a parent of bad boys, after disciplining them in one way or another, feels
guilty for the rest of her life because she didnÕt do Òthe right thing,Ó
according to the experts.</p>



<p>So we really ought to look into
theories that donÕt work, and science that isnÕt science.</p>



<p>I tried to find a principle for
discovering more of these kinds of things, and came up with the following
system.<span>Â  </span>Any time you find yourself
in a conversation at a cocktail partyÑin which you do not feel uncomfortable
that the hostess might come around and say, ÒWhy are you fellows talking
shop?ÕÕ or that your wife will come around and say, ÒWhy are you flirting
again?ÓÑthen you can be sure you are talking about something about which nobody
knows anything.</p>



<p>Using this method, I discovered a
few more topics that I had forgottenÑamong them the efficacy of various forms
of psychotherapy.<span>Â  </span>So I began to
investigate through the library, and so on, and I have so much to tell you that
I canÕt do it at all.<span>Â  </span>I will have
to limit myself to just a few little things.<span>Â  </span>IÕll concentrate on the things more people believe in.<span>Â  </span>Maybe I will give a series of speeches
next year on all these subjects.<span>Â 
</span>It will take a long time.</p>



<p>I think the educational and
psychological studies I mentioned are examples of what I would like to call
Cargo Cult Science.<span>Â  </span>In the South
Seas there is a Cargo Cult of people.<span>Â 
</span>During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and
they want the same thing to happen now.<span>Â 
</span>So theyÕve arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the
sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden
pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like
antennasÑheÕs the controllerÑand they wait for the airplanes to land.<span>Â  </span>TheyÕre doing everything right.<span>Â  </span>The form is perfect.<span>Â  </span>It looks exactly the way it looked
before.<span>Â  </span>But it doesnÕt work.<span>Â  </span>No airplanes land.<span>Â  </span>So I call these things Cargo Cult
Science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific
investigation, but theyÕre missing something essential, because the planes donÕt
land.</p>



<p>Now it behooves me, of course, to
tell you what theyÕre missing.<span>Â  </span>But
it would he just about as difficult to explain to the South Sea Islanders how
they have to arrange things so that they get some wealth in their system.<span>Â  </span>It is not something simple like telling
them how to improve the shapes of the earphones.<span>Â  </span>But there is <i>one</i><span>
feature I notice that is generally missing in Cargo Cult Science.<span>Â  </span>That is the idea that we all hope you
have learned in studying science in schoolÑwe never explicitly say what this </span><i>is</i><span>, but just hope that you catch on by all the examples
of scientific investigation.<span>Â  </span>It is
interesting, therefore, to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly.<span>Â  </span>ItÕs a kind of scientific integrity, a
principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honestyÑa
kind of leaning over backwards.<span>Â 
</span>For example, if youÕre doing an experiment, you should report everything
that you think might make it invalidÑnot only what you think is right about it:
other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of
that youÕve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they workedÑto make
sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.</span></p>



<p>Details that could throw doubt on
your interpretation must be given, if you know them.<span>Â  </span>You must do the best you canÑif you know anything at all
wrong, or possibly wrongÑto explain it.<span>Â 
</span>If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then
you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those
that agree with it.<span>Â  </span>There is also
a more subtle problem.<span>Â  </span>When you
have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make
sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the
things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory
makes something else come out right, in addition.</p>



<p>In summary, the idea is to try to
give <i>all</i><span> of the information to help
others to judge the value of your contribution; not just the information that
leads to judgment in one particular direction or another.</span></p>



<p>The easiest way to explain this
idea is to contrast it, for example, with advertising.<span>Â  </span>Last night I heard that Wesson Oil
doesnÕt soak through food.<span>Â  </span>Well,
thatÕs true.<span>Â  </span>ItÕs not dishonest;
but the thing IÕm talking about is not just a matter of not being dishonest,
itÕs a matter of scientific integrity, which is another level.<span>Â  </span>The fact that should be added to that
advertising statement is that <i>no</i><span> oils
soak through food, if operated at a certain temperature.<span>Â  </span>If operated at another temperature, they
</span><i>all </i><span>willÑincluding Wesson
Oil.<span>Â  </span>So itÕs the implication which
has been conveyed, not the fact, which is true, and the difference is what we
have to deal with.</span></p>



<p>WeÕve learned from experience
that the truth will out.<span>Â  </span>Other
experimenters will repeat your experiment and find out whether you were wrong
or right.<span>Â  </span>NatureÕs phenomena will
agree or theyÕll disagree with your theory.<span>Â  </span>And, although you may gain some temporary fame and
excitement, you will not gain a good reputation as a scientist if you havenÕt
tried to be very careful in this kind of work.<span>Â  </span>And itÕs this type of integrity, this kind of care not to
fool yourself, that is missing to a large extent in much of the research in
Cargo Cult Science.</p>



<p>A great deal of their difficulty
is, of course, the difficulty of the subject and the inapplicability of the
scientific method to the subject.<span>Â 
</span>Nevertheless, it should be remarked that this is not the only
difficulty.<span>Â  </span>ThatÕs <i>why</i><span> the planes donÕt landÑbut they donÕt land.</span></p>



<p>We have learned a lot from experience about how to handle
some of the ways we fool ourselves.<span>Â 
</span>One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an
experiment with falling oil drops and got an answer which we now know not to be
quite right.<span>Â  </span>ItÕs a little bit
off, because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air.<span>Â  </span>ItÕs interesting to look at the history
of measurements of the charge of the electron, after Millikan.<span>Â  </span>If you plot them as a function of time,
you find that one is a little bigger than MillikanÕs, and the next oneÕs a
little bit bigger than that, and the next oneÕs a little bit bigger than that,
until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.</p>



<p>Why didnÕt they discover that the
new number was higher right away?<span>Â 
</span>ItÕs a thing that scientists are ashamed ofÑthis historyÑbecause itÕs
apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too
high above MillikanÕs, they thought something must be wrongÑand they would look
for and find a reason why something might be wrong.<span>Â  </span>When they got a number closer to MillikanÕs value they
didnÕt look so hard.<span>Â  </span>And so they
eliminated the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like
that.<span>Â  </span>WeÕve learned those tricks
nowadays, and now we donÕt have that kind of a disease.</p>



<p>But this long history of learning
how to not fool ourselvesÑof having utter scientific integrityÑis, IÕm sorry to
say, something that we havenÕt specifically included in any particular course
that I know of.<span>Â  </span>We just hope youÕve
caught on by osmosis.</p>



<p>The first principle is that you
must not fool yourselfÑand you are the easiest person to fool.<span>Â  </span>So you have to be very careful about
that.<span>Â  </span>After youÕve not fooled
yourself, itÕs easy not to fool other scientists.<span>Â  </span>You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that.<span>Â  </span></p>



<p>I would like to add something
thatÕs not essential to the science, but something I kind of believe, which is
that you should not fool the layman when youÕre talking as a scientist. IÕm not
trying to tell you what to do about cheating on your wife, or fooling your
girlfriend, or something like that, when youÕre not trying to be a scientist,
but just trying to be an ordinary human being.<span>Â  </span>WeÕll leave those problems up to you and your rabbi.<span>Â  </span>IÕm talking about a specific, extra
type of integrity that is not lying, but bending over backwards to show how
youÕre maybe wrong, that you ought to do when acting as a scientist.<span>Â  </span>And this is our responsibility as
scientists, certainly to other scientists, and I think to laymen.</p>



<p>For example, I was a little
surprised when I was talking to a friend who was going to go on the radio.<span>Â  </span>He does work on cosmology and
astronomy, and he wondered how he would explain what the applications of this
work were.<span>Â  </span>ÒWell,Ó I said, Òthere
arenÕt any.Ó<span>Â  </span>He said, ÒYes, but
then we wonÕt get support for more research of this kind.Ó<span>Â  </span>I think thatÕs kind of dishonest.<span>Â  </span>If youÕre representing yourself as a
scientist, then you should explain to the layman what youÕre doingÑand if they
donÕt want to support you under those circumstances, then thatÕs their
decision.</p>



<p>One example of the principle is
this: If youÕve made up your mind to test a theory, or you want to explain some
idea, you should always decide to publish it whichever way it comes out.<span>Â  </span>If we only publish results of a certain
kind, we can make the argument look good.<span>Â 
</span>We must publish <i>both </i><span>kinds of
result.<span>Â  </span>For exampleÑletÕs take
advertising againÑsuppose some particular cigarette has some particular
property, like low nicotine.<span>Â  </span>ItÕs
published widely by the company that this means it is good for youÑthey donÕt
say, for instance, that the tars are a different proportion, or that something
else is the matter with the cigarette.<span>Â 
</span>In other words, publication probability depends upon the answer.<span>Â  </span>That should not be done.</span></p>



<p>I say thatÕs also important in
giving certain types of government advice. Supposing a senator asked you for
advice about whether drilling a hole should be done in his state; and you
decide it would he better in some other state.<span>Â  </span>If you donÕt publish such a result, it seems to me youÕre
not giving scientific advice.<span>Â 
</span>YouÕre being used.<span>Â  </span>If your
answer happens to come out in the direction the government or the politicians
like, they can use it as an argument in their favor; if it comes out the other
way, they donÕt publish it at all.<span>Â 
</span>ThatÕs not giving scientific advice.</p>



<p>Other kinds of errors are more
characteristic of poor science.<span>Â 
</span>When I was at Cornell.<span>Â  </span>I
often talked to the people in the psychology department.<span>Â  </span>One of the students told me she wanted
to do an experiment that went something like thisÑI donÕt remember it in
detail, but it had been found by others that under certain circumstances, X,
rats did something, A.<span>Â  </span>She was
curious as to whether, if she changed the circumstances to Y, they would still
do, A.<span>Â  </span>So her proposal was to do
the experiment under circumstances Y and see if they still did A.</p>



<p>I explained to her that it was
necessary first to repeat in her laboratory the experiment of the other
personÑto do it under condition X to see if she could also get result AÑand
then change to Y and see if A changed.<span>Â 
</span>Then she would know that the real difference was the thing she thought
she had under control.</p>



<p>She was very delighted with this
new idea, and went to her professor.<span>Â 
</span>And his reply was, no, you cannot do that, because the experiment has
already been done and you would be wasting time.<span>Â  </span>This was in about 1935 or so, and it seems to have been the
general policy then to not try to repeat psychological experiments, but only 
to
change the conditions and see what happens.</p>



<p>Nowadays thereÕs a certain danger
of the same thing happening, even in the famous field of physics.<span>Â  </span>I was shocked to hear of an experiment
done at the big accelerator at the National Accelerator Laboratory, where a
person used deuterium.<span>Â  </span>In order to
compare his heavy hydrogen results to what might happen to light hydrogen he
had to use data from someone elseÕs experiment on light hydrogen, which was
done on different apparatus.<span>Â  </span>When
asked he said it was because he couldnÕt get time on the program (because
thereÕs so little time and itÕs such expensive apparatus) to do the experiment
with light hydrogen on this apparatus because there wouldnÕt be any new
result.<span>Â  </span>And so the men in charge
of programs at NAL are so anxious for new results, in order to get more money
to keep the thing going for public relations purposes, they are
destroyingÑpossiblyÑthe value of the experiments themselves, which is the whole
purpose of the thing.<span>Â  </span>It is often
hard for the experimenters there to complete their work as their scientific
integrity demands.</p>



<p>All experiments in psychology are
not of this type, however.<span>Â  </span>For
example, there have been many experiments running rats through all kinds of
mazes, and so onÑwith little clear result.<span>Â  </span>But in 1937 a man named Young did a very interesting
one.<span>Â  </span>He had a long corridor with
doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the other side
where the food was.<span>Â  </span>He wanted to see
if he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from wherever he
started them off.<span>Â  </span>No.<span>Â  </span>The rats went immediately to the door
where the food had been the time before.</p>



<p>The question was, how did the
rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that
this was the same door as before?<span>Â 
</span>Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the
other doors.<span>Â  </span>So he painted the
doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly
the same.<span>Â  </span>Still the rats could
tell.<span>Â  </span>Then he thought maybe the
rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after
each run.<span>Â  </span>Still the rats could
tell.<span>Â  </span>Then he realized the rats
might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the
laboratory like any commonsense person.<span>Â 
</span>So he covered the corridor, and, still the rats could tell.</p>



<p>He finally found that they could
tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it.<span>Â  </span>And he could only fix that by putting
his corridor in sand.<span>Â  </span>So he
covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool
the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door.<span>Â  </span>If he relaxed any of his conditions,
the rats could tell.</p>



<p>Now, from a scientific
standpoint, that is an AâNumberâl experiment. That is the
experiment that makes ratârunning experiments sensible, because it
uncovers the clues that the rat is really usingÑnot what you think itÕs
using.<span>Â  </span>And that is the experiment
that tells exactly what conditions you have to use in order to be careful and
control everything in an experiment with ratârunning.</p>



<p>I looked into the subsequent
history of this research.<span>Â  </span>The
subsequent experiment, and the one after that, never referred to Mr.
Young.<span>Â  </span>They never used any of his
criteria of putting the corridor on sand, or being very careful.<span>Â  </span>They just went right on running rats in
the same old way, and paid no attention to the great discoveries of Mr. Young,
and his papers are not referred to, because he didnÕt discover anything about
the rats.<span>Â  </span>In fact, he discovered <i>all</i><span> the things you have to do to discover something
about rats.<span>Â  </span>But not paying
attention to experiments like that is a characteristic of Cargo Cult Science.</span></p>



<p>Another example is the ESP experiments of Mr. Rhine, and
other people.<span>Â  </span>As various people
have made criticismsÑand they themselves have made criticisms of their own
experimentsÑthey improve the techniques so that the effects are smaller, and
smaller, and smaller until they gradually disappear.<span>Â  </span>All the parapsychologists are looking for some experiment
that can be repeatedÑthat you can do again and get the same
effectÑstatistically, even.<span>Â  </span>They
run a million ratsÑno, itÕs people this timeÑthey do a lot of things and get a
certain statistical effect.<span>Â  </span>Next
time they try it they donÕt get it any more.<span>Â  </span>And now you find a man saying that it is an irrelevant
demand to expect a repeatable experiment.<span>Â 
</span>This is <i>science</i><span>?</span></p>



<p>This man also speaks about a new
institution, in a talk in which he was resigning as Director of the Institute
of Parapsychology.<span>Â  </span>And, in telling
people what to do next, he says that one of the things they have to do is be
sure they only train students who have shown their ability to get PSI results
to an acceptable extentÑnot to waste their time on those ambitious and
interested students who get only chance results.<span>Â  </span>It is very dangerous to have such a policy in teachingÑto
teach students only how to get certain results, rather than how to do an
experiment with scientific integrity.</p>



<p>So I wish to youÑI have no more time, so I have just one
wish for youÑthe good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the
kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need
to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on,
to lose your integrity.<span>Â  </span>May you
have that freedom.<span>Â  </span>May I also give
you one last bit of advice: Never say that youÕll give a talk unless you know
clearly what youÕre going to talk about and more or less what youÕre going to
say.</p>
