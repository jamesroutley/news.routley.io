<h3>FAQ</h3>

<h4>1. Where&#39;s the Slack button?</h4>
<p>I lost ownership of the Slack application due to Slack&#39;s policy. I tried to regain ownership of my own application but it was not possible.</p>

<h4>2. Why is this free?</h4>
<p>This API is widely used as an education tool, and for entretainment purposes. I&#39;ve been hosting it for free for 6 years I&#39;d like to keep it that way.</p>
<p>If you are interested in supporting this API, you can always <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kinduff" target="_blank">Buy me a coffee</a>.</p>

<h4>3. Why is V1 deprecated?</h4>
<p>The V1 version doesn&#39;t follow any kind of standard and was built to not be scalable. With V2, I&#39;m planning to add new features including breeds, pictures, and other cool dog data.</p>

<h4>4. How can I get an API key?</h4>
<p>No need for now! I might introduce it in the future.</p>

<h4>5. Who are you?</h4>
<p>I&#39;m <a href="https://kinduff.com" target="_blank">kinduff</a>! I love to build silly things and share them to the world. If you have built something interesting, let me know, it will inspire me to keep this service going. Send me an email at dev@dogapi.dog and I will check it out!</p>
