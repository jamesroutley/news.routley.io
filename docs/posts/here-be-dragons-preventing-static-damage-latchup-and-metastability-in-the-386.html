    <h1>Here be dragons: Preventing static damage, latchup, and metastability in the 386</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-3975009420599472603" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>I&#39;ve been reverse-engineering the Intel 386 processor (from 1985), and I&#39;ve come across some interesting
circuits for the chip&#39;s input/output (I/O) pins.
Since these pins communicate with the outside world, they face special dangers:
static electricity and latchup can destroy the chip, while metastability can cause serious malfunctions.
These I/O circuits are completely different from the logic circuits in the 386, and I&#39;ve come
across a previously-undescribed flip-flop circuit, so I&#39;m
venturing into uncharted territory.
In this article, I take a close look at how the I/O circuitry protects the 386 from
the &#34;dragons&#34; that can destroy it.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-iodrivers/die-pads.jpg"><img alt="The 386 die, zooming in on some of the bond pad circuits.

The colors change due to the effects of different microscope lenses. Click this image (or any other) for a larger version.</p>
<p>The photo above shows the die of the 386 under a microscope.
The dark, complex patterns arranged in rectangular regions arise from the two layers of metal that connect the circuits on the 386 chip.
Not visible are the transistors, formed from silicon and polysilicon and hidden beneath the metal.
Around the perimeter of this fingernail-sized silicon die, 141 square bond pads provide the connections between
the chip and the outside world; tiny gold bond wires connect the bond pads to the package.
Next to each I/O pad, specialized circuitry provides the electrical interface between the
chip and the external components while protecting the chip.
I&#39;ve zoomed in on three groups of these bond pads along with the associated I/O circuits.
The circuits at the top (for data pins) and the left (for address pins) are completely different from the
control pin circuits at the bottom, showing how the
circuitry varies with the pin&#39;s function.</p>
<h2>Static electricity</h2>
<p>The first dragon that threatens the 386 is static electricity, able to burn a hole in the chip.
MOS transistors are constructed with a thin insulating oxide layer
underneath the transistor&#39;s gate.
In the 386, this fragile, glass-like oxide layer is just 250 nm thick, the thickness of a virus.
Static electricity, even a small amount, can blow a hole through this oxide layer and
destroy the chip.
If you&#39;ve ever walked across a carpet and felt a spark when you touch a doorknob, you&#39;ve generated at least 3000 volts
of chip-destroying static electricity. <!-- 500 volts according to https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683251/current/esd-performance.html -->
Intel recommends an anti-static mat and a grounding wrist strap when installing a processor to
avoid the danger of static electricity, also known as Electrostatic Discharge or ESD.<span id="fnref:esd"><a href="#fn:esd">1</a></span></p>
<p>To reduce the risk of ESD damage, chips have protection diodes and other components in their I/O circuitry.
The schematic below shows the circuit for a typical 386 input.
The goal is to prevent static discharge from reaching the inverter, where it could destroy the inverter&#39;s transistors.
The diodes next to the pad provide the first layer of protection; they redirect excess voltage to the +5 rail or ground.
Next, the resistor reduces the current that can reach the inverter.
The third diode provides a final layer of protection.
(One unusual feature of this input—unrelated to ESD—is that the input has a pull-up, which is implemented with a transistor that acts like a 20KΩ resistor.<span id="fnref:bs16"><a href="#fn:bs16">2</a></span>)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-iodrivers/bs16-schematic.jpg"><img alt="Schematic for the BS16# pad circuit.

The <code>BS16#</code> signal indicates to the 386 if the external bus is 16 bits or 32 bits.</p>
<p>The image below shows how this circuit appears on the die.
For this photo, I dissolved the metal layers with acids, stripping the die down to the silicon to make the transistors visible.
The diodes and pull-up resistor are implemented with transistors.<span id="fnref:ggnmos"><a href="#fn:ggnmos">3</a></span>
Large grids of transistors form the pad-side diodes, while the third diode is above.
The pull-up resistor is implemented with polysilicon, which provides higher resistance than metal wiring.
The capacitor is implemented with a plate of polysilicon over silicon, separated by a thin oxide layer.
As you can see, the protection circuitry occupies much more area than the inverters that process the signal.</p>

<h2>Latchup</h2>
<p>The transistors in the 386 are created by doping silicon with impurities to change its properties, creating regions of
&#34;N-type&#34; and &#34;P-type&#34; silicon.
The 386 chip, like most processors, is built from CMOS technology, so it uses two types of transistors: NMOS and PMOS.
The 386 starts from a wafer of N-type silicon and
PMOS transistors are formed by doping tiny regions to form P-type silicon embedded in the underlying N-type silicon.
NMOS transistors are the opposite, with N-type silicon embedded in P-type silicon.
To hold the NMOS transistors, &#34;wells&#34; of P-type silicon are formed, as shown in the cross-section diagram below.
Thus, the 386 chip contains complex patterns of P-type and N-type silicon that form its 285,000 transistors.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-iodrivers/latchup-cross-section.jpg"><img alt="The structure of NMOS and PMOS transistors in the 386 forms parasitic NPN and PNP transistors. This diagram is the opposite of other latchup diagrams because the 386 uses N substrate, the opposite of modern chips with P substrate." height="244" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-iodrivers/latchup-cross-section-w500.jpg" title="The structure of NMOS and PMOS transistors in the 386 forms parasitic NPN and PNP transistors.

This diagram is the opposite of other latchup diagrams because the 386 uses N substrate, the opposite of modern chips with P substrate.</p>
<p>But something dangerous lurks below the surface, the fire-breathing dragon of latchup waiting to burn up the chip.
The problem is that these regions of N-type and P-type silicon form unwanted, &#34;parasitic&#34; transistors underneath
the desired transistors.
In normal circumstances, these parasitic NPN and PNP transistors are inactive and can be ignored.
But if a current flows beneath the surface, through the silicon substrate,
it can turn on a parasitic transistor and awaken the dreaded latchup.<span id="fnref:substrate"><a href="#fn:substrate">4</a></span>
The parasitic transistors form a feedback loop, so if one transistor starts to turn on,
it turns on the other transistor, and so forth, until both transistors are fully on, a state called latchup.<span id="fnref:scr"><a href="#fn:scr">5</a></span>
Moreover, the feedback loop will maintain latchup until the chip&#39;s power is removed.<span id="fnref:power-cycle"><a href="#fn:power-cycle">6</a></span>
During latchup, the chip&#39;s power and ground are shorted through the parasitic transistors, causing high current flow that
can destroy the chip by overheating it or even melting bond wires.</p>
<p>Latchup can be triggered in many ways, from power supply overvoltage to radiation, but
a chip&#39;s I/O pins are the primary risk because signals from the outside world are unpredictable.
For instance, suppose a floppy drive is connected to the 386 and the drive sends a signal with a voltage higher than
the 386&#39;s 5-volt supply.
(This could happen due to a voltage surge in the drive, reflection in a signal line, or even connecting a cable.)
Current will flow through the 386&#39;s protection diodes, the diodes that were described in the previous section.<span id="fnref:latchup-recommendations"><a href="#fn:latchup-recommendations">7</a></span>
If this current flows through the chip&#39;s silicon substrate, it can trigger latchup and destroy the processor.</p>
<p>Because of this danger, the 386&#39;s I/O pads are designed to prevent latchup.
One solution is to block the unwanted currents through the substrate, essentially putting fences around the transistors
to keep malicious currents from escaping into the substrate.
In the 386, this fence consists of &#34;guard rings&#34; around the I/O transistors and diodes.
These rings prevent latchup by blocking unwanted current flow and safely redirecting it to power or ground.</p>

<p>The diagram above shows the double guard rings for a typical I/O pad.<span id="fnref:wr-schematic"><a href="#fn:wr-schematic">8</a></span>
Separate guard rings protect the NMOS transistors and the PMOS transistors.
The NMOS transistors have an inner guard ring of P-type silicon connected to ground (blue) and an outer guard ring of N-type silicon
connected to +5 (red). The rings are reversed for the PMOS transistors.
The guard rings take up significant space on the die, but this space isn&#39;t wasted since the rings protect the chip from latchup.</p>
<h2>Metastability</h2>
<p>The final dragon is metastability: it (probably) won&#39;t destroy the chip, but it can cause
serious malfunctions.<span id="fnref:spacecraft"><a href="#fn:spacecraft">9</a></span>
Metastability is a peculiar problem where a digital signal can take an unbounded amount of time to settle into
a zero or a one.
In other words, the circuit temporarily refuses to act digitally and shows its underlying analog nature.<span id="fnref:vonada"><a href="#fn:vonada">10</a></span>
Metastability was controversial in the 1960s and the 1970s, with many electrical engineers not believing it existed or
considering it irrelevant.
Nowadays, metastability is well understood, with special circuits to prevent it, but metastability can never
be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>In a processor, everything is synchronized to its clock.
While a modern processor has a clock speed of several gigahertz, the 386&#39;s clock ran at 12 to 33 megahertz.
Inside the processor, signals are carefully organized to change according to the clock—that&#39;s why your
computer runs faster with a higher clock speed.
The problem is that external signals may be independent of the CPU&#39;s clock.
For instance, a disk drive could send an interrupt to the computer when data is ready, which depends on the timing
of the spinning disk.
If this interrupt arrives at just the wrong time, it can trigger metastability.</p>

<p>In more detail, processors use flip-flops to hold signals under the control of the clock.
An &#34;edge-triggered&#34; flip-flop grabs its
input at the moment the clock goes high (the &#34;rising edge&#34;) and holds this value until the next clock cycle.
Everything is fine if the value is stable when the clock changes:
if the input signal switches from low to high before the clock edge, the flip-flop will hold this high value.
And if the input signal switches from low to high <em>after</em> the clock edge, the flip-flop will hold the low value, since
the input was low at the clock edge.
But what happens if the input changes from low to high at the exact time that the clock switches?
Usually, the flip-flop will pick either low or high.
But very rarely, maybe a few times out of a billion, the flip-flop will hesitate in between, neither low nor high.
The flip-flop may take a few nanoseconds before it &#34;decides&#34; on a low or high value, and the value will be intermediate
until then.</p>
<p>The photo above illustrates a metastable signal, spending an unpredictable time between zero and one before settling
on a value.
The situation is similar to a ball balanced on top of a hill, a point of unstable equilibrium.<span id="fnref:physics"><a href="#fn:physics">11</a></span>
The smallest perturbation will knock the ball down one of the two stable positions at the bottom of the hill, but you
don&#39;t know which way it will go or how long it will take.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-iodrivers/hill.jpg"><img alt="A metaphorical view of metastability as a ball on a hill, able to roll down either side." height="156" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-iodrivers/hill-w300.jpg" title="A metaphorical view of metastability as a ball on a hill, able to roll down either side." width="300"/></a></p><p>A metaphorical view of metastability as a ball on a hill, able to roll down either side.</p>
<p>Metastability is serious because if a digital signal has a value that is neither 0 nor 1 then downstream
circuitry may get confused.
For instance, if part of the processor thinks that it received an interrupt and other parts of the processor think
that no interrupt happened, chaos will reign as the processor takes contradictory actions.
Moreover, waiting a few nanoseconds isn&#39;t a cure because the duration of metastability can be arbitrarily long.
Waiting helps, since the chance of metastability decreases exponentially with time, but there is no guarantee.<span id="fnref:metastability"><a href="#fn:metastability">12</a></span></p>
<p>The obvious solution is to never change an input exactly when the clock changes.
The processor is designed so that internal signals are stable when the clock changes, avoiding metastability.
Specifically, the designer of a flip-flop specifies the <em>setup</em> time—how long the signal must be stable before the clock edge—and the <em>hold</em> time—how long the signal must be stable after the clock edge.
As long as the input satisfies these conditions, typically a few picoseconds long,
the flip-flop will function without metastability.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the setup and hold times can&#39;t be guaranteed when the processor receives an external signal that
isn&#39;t synchronized to its clock, known as an asynchronous signal.
For instance, a processor receives interrupt signals when an I/O device has data, but the timing is unpredictable
because it depends on 
mechanical factors such as a keypress or a spinning floppy disk.
Most of the time, everything will work fine, but what about the one-in-a-billion case where the timing of the
signal is unlucky?
(Since modern processors run at multi-gigahertz, one-in-a-billion events are not rare; they
can happen multiple times per second.)</p>
<p>One solution is a circuit called a synchronizer that takes an asynchronous signal and
synchronizes it to the clock.
A synchronizer can be implemented with two flip-flops in series:
even if the first flip-flop has a metastable output, chances are that it will resolve to 0 or 1 before the second flip-flop
stores the value.
Each flip-flop provides an exponential reduction in the chance of metastability, so using two flip-flops
drastically reduces the risk.
In other words, the circuit will still fail occasionally, but if the mean time between failures (MTBF) is long enough
(say, decades instead of seconds), then the risk is acceptable.</p>
<!--
The problem of metastability arises often in FPGA design, whenever a signal crosses a clock domain.
That is, if two parts of the FPGA use different clocks, the risk of metastability arises whenever
a signal is generated with one clock and used with another clock.
The standard FPGA solution is a synchronizer register chain with two flip-flops or more,
such as this [Intel recommendation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683082/21-3/synchronization-register-chains.html)
-->

<p>The schematic above shows how the 386 uses two flip-flops to minimize metastability.
The first flip-flop is a special flip-flop that is based on a sense amplifier.
It is much more complicated than a regular flip-flop, but it responds faster, reducing the
chance of metastability.
It is built from two of the sense-amplifier latches below, which I haven&#39;t seen described anywhere.
In a DRAM memory chip, a sense amplifier takes a weak signal from a memory cell and rapidly amplifies it into a
solid 0 or 1.
In this flip-flop, the sense amplifier takes a potentially ambiguous signal and rapidly amplifies it into a 0 or 1.
By amplifying the signal quickly, the flip-flop reduces metastability.
(See the footnote for details.<span id="fnref:sense-latch"><a href="#fn:sense-latch">14</a></span>)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/386-iodrivers/sense-latch.jpg"><img alt="The sense amplifier latch circuit." height="436" src="https://static.righto.com/images/386-iodrivers/sense-latch-w350.jpg" title="The sense amplifier latch circuit." width="350"/></a></p><p>The sense amplifier latch circuit.</p>
<p>The die photo below shows how this circuitry looks on the die. Each flip-flop is built from two latches;
note that the sense-amp latches are larger than the standard latches.
As before, the pad has protection diodes inside guard rings. For some reason, however,
these diodes have a different structure from the transistor-based diodes described earlier.
The 386 has five inputs that use this circuitry to protect against metastability.<span id="fnref:metastable-pins"><a href="#fn:metastable-pins">13</a></span>
These inputs are all located together at the bottom of the die—it probably makes the layout more compact when
neighboring pad circuits are all the same size.</p>

<p>In summary, the 386&#39;s I/O circuits are interesting because they are completely different from the chip&#39;s regular logic circuitry.
In these circuits, the border between digital and analog breaks down; these circuits handle binary signals, but
analog issues dominate the design.
Moreover, hidden parasitic transistors play key roles; what you don&#39;t see can be more important than what you see.
These circuits defend against three dangerous &#34;dragons&#34;: static electricity, latchup, and metastability.
Intel succeeded in warding off these dragons and the 386 was a success.</p>
