      <span>Abstract:</span>  Neurosymbolic Programming (NP) techniques have the potential to accelerate
scientific discovery. These models combine neural and symbolic components to
learn complex patterns and representations from data, using high-level concepts
or known constraints. NP techniques can interface with symbolic domain
knowledge from scientists, such as prior knowledge and experimental context, to
produce interpretable outputs. We identify opportunities and challenges between
current NP models and scientific workflows, with real-world examples from
behavior analysis in science: to enable the use of NP broadly for workflows
across the natural and social sciences.
