        <p>This pictorial periodic table is colorful, fun, and packed with information.
          In addition to the element&#39;s name, symbol, and atomic number, each
          element box has a drawing of one of the element&#39;s main human uses or
          natural occurrences. The table is color-coded to show the chemical
          groupings. Small symbols pack in additional information: solid/liquid/gas,
          color of element, common in the human body, common in the earth&#39;s crust,
          magnetic metals, noble metals, radioactive, and rare or never found
          in nature. It does not overload kids with a lot of detailed numbers,
          like atomic weights and valence numbers.</p>
        <p>Note: <em>Elements in Pictures</em> and <em>Elements in Words</em> are
          a set. Either may stand alone, but they work best together.</p>

        <p>This textual periodic table is packed with even more information.
          In addition to the element&#39;s name, symbol, and atomic number, each
          element box contains a textual description of the element&#39;s physical
          properties and a list of several of its human uses and/or natural occurrences.
          The table is color-coded to show the chemical groups, and each group
          is described in a panel of the same color. Other info panels describe
          atomic structure, chemical bonding, and radioactivity. It does not
          overload kids with a lot of detailed numbers, but it does provide some
          simple rules-of-thumb about atomic weights and valence numbers.</p>

        <p>This is exactly the same as <em>Elements in Pictures</em> above, but
          with less information. The fine print — the legend boxes and
          the small symbols — have been removed. Use this if you want a
          cleaner image with less visual clutter, or you want less information,
          or you want to print smaller or at lower resolution. </p>

        <p>Print-your-own elements cards. Use these however you want. It&#39;s fun
          to simply lay them out to make the whole periodic table. You can use
          them as flash cards to help you memorize the facts on the front and
          back of each card. If you want to play it as a game, you can invent
          your own game rules.</p>
        <p>Print double-sided on card stock. Cut out cards with paper cutter
          or scissors. Nine cards per sheet. There&#39;s a card for every element,
          with a picture on the front and words on the back. Also included are
          key cards (symbol key and color key), info cards (atom info and bonding
          info), and group info cards. The zip file also includes a template
          for making a card box. It also includes printing instructions.</p>
        <p>Sorry, card decks are not for sale at the <a target="_blank" href="http://cafepress.com/WlonkShop">Wlonk
            Shop</a>. You need to print them yourself. See <a href="https://elements.wlonk.com/ElementsLinks.htm">Links</a> for

          for example, each student chooses one element.</p>
        <p>Print single-sided. Elements 1-98 have pictures. Also included are

          has spaces for the student to write the element&#39;s symbol, name, atomic
          number, description, uses and/or occurrences, and a space to draw a
          picture.</p>
        <p><em>Are you homeschooling? This activity can occupy your student for
            one or many days. If you want a big activity, print out 98 of these
            worksheets, and assign your student to research every element from
            1 to 98 (the elements with uses) and fill out a worksheet for each
            element, one or a few elements per day. This not just busywork; knowing
            some facts about each element is useful basic knowledge for many
            careers: engineering, manufacturing, biology, medicine, ecology,
            agriculture, geology, physics, and, of course, chemistry!</em></p>

          <p>This left-step periodic table is the basis for the spiral, cone,

          <p>This left-step table is a slightly modified version of the left-step
            table by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Janet" target="_blank">Charles
            Janet</a> (1928). This compact version places hydrogen, helium, lithium,
            and beryllium all in a single row.</p>
          <p>Note that hydrogen is unique — it may be grouped with the
            alkali metals (like lithium) because it has one electron available
            to donate, grouped with the halogens (like fluorine) because gaining
            one electron will fill its valence shell, or it may be put in a group
            of its own.</p>

              shows all the fundamental atomic electron orbitals as electron
              probability density distributions (fuzzy clouds), which is close
              as you can get to visualizing what an atom really looks like. The
              orbitals are labeled. It describes other ways to visualize atoms,
              namely, electron orbits (like planets) and surfaces of constant
              probability (bulgy blobs). It has a small periodic table showing

              all the elementary particles in the standard model (SM) of particle
              physics, and many non-elementary particles too. It starts with
              the basics: an atom contains a nucleus of protons and neutrons,
              which are made of quarks. The chart organizes all the important
              particles and classes of particles: elementary fermions (quarks,
              leptons, electrons, neutrinos), elementary bosons (gluons, photons,
              W and Z bosons, Higgs, and predicted gravitons), composite particles
              (hadrons, baryons, protons, neutrons, mesons), anti-particles.

            <p>Note: In the coming years, physicists may discover new particles
              or significantly revise the standard model of particle physics,
              due to new experimental results from colliders, such as the Large
              Hadron Collider (LHC), and new observations from telescopes.</p>
