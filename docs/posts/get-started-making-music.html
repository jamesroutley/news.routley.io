<p>In these lessons, you&#39;ll learn the basics of music making. No prior experience or equipment is required; you&#39;ll do everything right here in your browser.</p>
<p>To get started, check out the boxes below. Each one contains a small piece of music. Click a box to turn it on or off.</p>
 


<p>After playing with these boxes for a while, you&#39;ll discover certain combinations that you like. Many types of music are created in exactly this way â€” by mixing and matching small musical ideas to make interesting combinations, and then changing those combinations over time.</p>
<p>Now you&#39;ve combined pre-made musical patterns. Next, you&#39;ll make some patterns of your own.</p>
