<p><span>She draws water from a well in her patio in Ecatepec, but it’s not fit for drinking. She can, however, use it for filling toilets, cleaning, or laundry. The water is unfiltered, she says, and it has caused her skin problems. </span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Norma, 68 years old, collects unfiltered, nonpotable water from a well in her yard in Ecatepec, Mexico, May 9, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-1-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://archive.is/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-1-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><span></span></p><p><span>Norma, 68 years old, collects unfiltered, nonpotable water from a well in her yard in Ecatepec, Mexico, May 9, 2024.
</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Though Norma is a widow, she is not alone. As Mexico City continues to expand while resources become scarce, its water crisis impacts millions. It exemplifies a future that cities worldwide could face if global warming and overpopulation continue. From springs that have been sealed or pipelined to rainwater that goes unused and into the drain, to drinking water that gets polluted or spilled on its way into homes across the megalopolis, many issues have created this crisis.</span></p>

<p><span>Norma lives by herself in a small house, which is sinking — another byproduct of the Mexican capital’s unquenchable thirst for water. According to Norma, the bedroom has already descended 20 inches below ground level. She feels constantly under stress, not just from poverty but also from the criminal groups prowling around her neighborhood. She refuses to provide her last name for this report, fearing retaliation.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Two hours away from Mexico’s capital, the water reservoir at the town of Valle de Bravo collects most of its water from nearby rivers and springs and is the main source for the Cutzamala water system. This system provides more than a quarter of Mexico City’s drinking water.</span></p>

<p><span>A complex network of about 45 miles of canals, 26 miles of tunnels, and six siphons, the Cutzamala system also has six pumping stations, 11 dams, 10 reservoirs, a major treatment plant, two storage reservoirs, and four storage reservoirs at the Mexico City terminal. Despite its complexity and engineering, it’s one of the key pivots in the city’s water crisis.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="A tower at the reservoir at Valle de Bravo shows water stains, marking where the water had previously been much higher." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-2-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://archive.is/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-2-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><span></span></p><p><span>The main reservoir at Valle de Bravo on May 8, 2024. That month, it was at its lowest level ever: 30% capacity. Water stains and markings note the reservoir’s various levels over the years. 
</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Prolonged overuse is one reason the lake has been so critically affected by drought. Agricultural demands, local consumption, and the city’s water needs have stretched its resources to a breaking point. Climate change has further exacerbated the situation, with erratic rainfall and extended dry seasons making it increasingly difficult to replenish the lake and ensure water stability.</span></p>

<p><span>The water scarcity has fueled social tensions as the Valle de Bravo community struggles to balance its own needs with the obligation to share water with Mexico City. In 2024, the town faced severe challenges due to dwindling water levels, and residents have had to adopt water-saving policies during drought seasons. They have also pushed the government to monitor the illegal diversion of creeks and rivers to wealthy, private properties and the building of unauthorized, restricted lagoons.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="The Cutzamala system, which provides water to Mexico City from the Cutzamala River, is seen with a drying reservoir." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-3-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://archive.is/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-3-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><span></span></p><p><span>The Cutzamala system is a complex interbasin transfer network built in three stages, from the late 1970s to 1994, to supply water from the Cutzamala River to the Mexico City metropolitan area, May 8, 2024.

The reservoir lake has experienced some of the lowest levels in its history, making it harder for visitors to enjoy popular water sports in the area, such as skiing, flyboarding, paddle surfing, kayaking, sailing, and fishing. Angered Valle de Bravo inhabitants are pressuring authorities to regulate water usage for swimming pools on properties used mostly by tourists and property owners from big cities who vacation there. </span></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="A water pipe of the Cutzamala water system, May 8, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-4-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://archive.is/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-4-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><span></span></p><p><span>A water pipe of the Cutzamala water system, May 8, 2024.

</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Following months of severe drought in 2024, the late arrival of seasonal rains and emergency conservation measures such as localized rainwater harvesting brought some relief. The Cutzamala reservoir’s capacity increased to 67% in November 2024, up from 30% in May, according to data from Mexico’s National Water Commission. Government actions, including water rationing in Mexico City, likely contributed to this recovery. This increased capacity also provided temporary relief to the capital, which saw more consistent water distribution and fewer interruptions for urban areas. By February 2025, the reserve registered levels close to 61% of its capacity, which is still below the average levels of 72.3%, according to Valle de Bravo’s local water authorities. </span></p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div id="video-block-1047634905"><p><span>The Cutzamala pumping system provides much of the drinking water to Mexico City, May 8, 2024.</span><span>Video by Alan Yàñez</span></p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>In addition, wildfires have become an increasing threat to the area. In May 2024, several fires severely affected Valle de Bravo’s surrounding protected natural forests.</span></p>

<p><span>But the recovering water levels have not fully addressed concerns by communities around the reservoir, including Valle de Bravo, about resource depletion and inequitable water distribution. Residents remain wary of government priorities that seem to favor urban supply and wealthy real estate investors over the needs of local residents. And without sustainable practices and investments in the area’s water systems, the cycle of scarcity will persist, continuing to threaten livelihoods and lives.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Several pumping engines at the beginning of the Cutzamala system, May 8, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-8-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://archive.is/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-8-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><span></span></p><p><span>Several pumping engines at the beginning of the Cutzamala system, May 8, 2024.
</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Mexico City was built on top of what used to be a large body of water, which would make its water shortage appear ironic if it wasn’t so tragic. In the early 1300s, the Mexica (or Aztecs) settled on an island in the middle of what used to be a huge lake called Texcoco, the largest among five intertwined lakes. </span></p>

<p><span>But after the arrival of the Spaniards, the city started to expand, and the urban sprawl caused the lake system to dry up. By the early 20th century, the rivers feeding the once-rich lake zone were put into pipelines to make way for motor vehicles. Very little is left of the lakes, while the rivers have become practically invisible.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="A “pipero” — a tanker truck driver who distributes drinking water to neighborhoods where it is in short supply — jumps from a tanker truck, May 27, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1921" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-11-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://archive.is/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-11-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><span></span></p><p><span>A “pipero” — a tanker truck driver who distributes drinking water to neighborhoods where it is in short supply — jumps from a tanker truck, May 27, 2024.

</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>Groundwater, depleted by decades of overexploitation, along with the soft soil that used to be the lake bed, can no longer support the megalopolis. The sections of the city built on top of where the lakes used to be are literally sinking under their own weight. </span></p>

<p><span>The city’s sinking also causes major water leaks and spills, as underground pipelines fracture. Seismic activity, common in Mexico City, worsens the situation. Research from Mexico’s National Autonomous University indicates that 40% of Mexico City’s water is lost due to these spills.</span></p>

<p><span>“The settlement and historical development of this huge city, since pre-Columbian times, is in a closed basin on the bed of a lake,” says Hilda Hesselbach, a consultant for international development agencies in Mexico and a biologist specializing in nature conservation issues, including water preservation. “So, among the main problems of the water crisis come floods and, in part, differential sinking of the city due to compression of the ground.” </span></p>

<p><span>This is particularly evident in Mexico City’s historic downtown, where buildings and avenues buckle and tilt as they descend into the unstable soil. It also extends to nearby areas like the working-class suburbs of Ecatepec, where the problem is as glaringly obvious as Norma’s sunken bedroom.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="A young boy helps his father fill a can of water that he has just drawn from a manhole in the street, May 27, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1708" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-13-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://archive.is/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-13-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><span></span></p><p><span>A young boy helps his father fill a can of water that he has just drawn from a manhole in the street, May 27, 2024.

</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>During Ecatepec’s tough drought seasons, taps run dry and running water becomes unavailable in the most impoverished areas, where residents draw water from public manholes and carry it away in plastic jerricans. But the area does get a significant amount of rain throughout the year (between 23 and 47 inches per annum), which is why nearly three-quarters of Mexico City’s water comes from </span><span>underground wells and springs. “But since there has not been any real urban planning based on water, many of these groundwater recharge areas have been sealed off as a result of urban growth,” Hesselbach says.</span></p>

<p><span>“It’s an inefficient, not to say absurd, water management scheme,” she adds, citing poor administrative and planning systems with no effective current regulations. This leaves people like Norma to </span><span>pull water from the ground wells without filtration, leading to skin and stomach diseases for those who use it.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="A man sticks his arm and head into a manhole to extract water with a bucket, May 27, 2024." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1708" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-15-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://archive.is/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-15-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><span></span></p><p><span>A man sticks his arm and head into a manhole to extract water with a bucket, May 27, 2024.

<p><span>Taking advantage of the authorities’ lack of supervision, criminal groups steal water from public wells and pipes to sell it to local residents.

<p><span>But for some experts, solutions exist. Better wastewater treatment could increase supply and reduce pollution. Rainwater harvesting systems could cut residents’ dependence on water trucks.

<p><span>The agricultural islands, known as chinampas, were created over 2,000 years ago by Indigenous peoples of the Mexico City basin. Five hundred years after the fall of the Mexica Empire, Xochimilco’s floating gardens are still cultivated and produce food, flowers, and ornamental plants. In 2018, the United Nations designated this area a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System.</span></p>

<p><span>“These chinampas became the most productive food system in Mexico’s history, sustaining entire civilizations and proving that agriculture and ecology can coexist harmoniously,” says Johanna Hernández, a marketing director of Arca Tierra, a Mexican network dedicated to the sustainable production of food through regenerative agriculture and fair trade.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="Farmers work in their chinampa in Xochimilco, May 25, 2019." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1927" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-34-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://archive.is/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-34-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><span></span></p><p><span>Farmers work in their chinampa in Xochimilco, May 25, 2019.

</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><p><span>To reach the floating agricultural plots, one must cross their polluted surroundings with chaotic concrete sprawl and relentless traffic before venturing down the canals. Urban expansion and low farming incomes force some to abandon these traditional practices for more profitable ventures, like converting chinampas into residential plots.</span></p>

<p><span>“Today this vital agro-ecosystem is at serious risk. Urban pressure, abandonment, pollution, and the industrialization of the food system have led to only 20% of the 2,215 hectares (5,470 acres) of chinampas being actively cultivated,” says Hernández.</span><span></span></p>



<p><span>Preserving the chinampas is vital — not only for their cultural heritage but also for their role in supporting local biodiversity and regulating the urban climate. The gardens are home to one of Mexico’s richest hubs of biodiversity, including the most iconic species of Xochimilco, the</span> <span>axolotl</span><b>,</b><span> an endemic amphibian once abundant here. Today it is critically endangered, threatened by urban pressure, the destruction of chinampas, water shortages, climate warming, and pesticide contamination.</span></p>

<p><span>Local and international organizations like Arca Tierra fight to save this ecosystem and make it sustainable. Since 2009, this nonprofit has worked to ensure sustainability by supporting small-scale farmers socially, ecologically, and economically. It implements agroforestry techniques in Xochimilco to restore soil health and biodiversity, while improving water management by reducing evaporation and improving water retention.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p><img alt="A farmer plowing a field with his horse in the Amecameca region, March 14, 2018." loading="lazy" width="2560" height="945" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-36-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75 1x" src="https://archive.is/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fphoto.longlead-cms.decimalstudios.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F5%2F2025%2F01%2FMCW_resized-36-scaled.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75"/><span></span></p><p><span>A farmer plowing a field with his horse in the Amecameca region, March 14, 2018.

She says that by replicating their principles to address modern environmental challenges, wetland agriculture can help cities adapt to water scarcity and ensure local food security. </span></p>

<p><span>“Chinampas are a living example of how human intervention can be a force for good, fostering life and biodiversity. While it is often said that humans are the worst thing that has happened to the planet, Xochimilco proves otherwise. This system demonstrates that when we step away from centering ourselves in everything we can regenerate the world around us,” Hernández says. </span></p>

<p><span>“However, its future depends on collective action — from government agencies, private businesses, NGOs, and citizens alike,” she adds.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div>
