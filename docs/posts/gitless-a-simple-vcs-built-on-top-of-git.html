      <p>
      Say you are in directory <code>foo</code> and you want turn it into a
      repository. You do this with the
      <code><a id="gl-init">gl init</a></code> command. This transforms
      the current working directory into an empty repository and you
      are now ready to start saving changes to files in <code>foo</code>:
      </p>
      <div>
      <pre><code><span>$</span> mkdir foo
<span>$</span> cd foo/
<span>$</span> gl init
<span>✔ Local repo created in /MyFiles/foo</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
      In most cases, instead of starting with an empty repository, there&#39;s already
      some existing remote repository you want to work on. To clone a remote repository,
      you pass the URL of the repository to the same <code>gl init</code> command, as
      shown below (note that you&#39;ll have
      to replace <code>https://github.com/gitless-vcs/try-gitless</code> with
      the URL of your repo):
      </p>
      <div>
      <pre><code><span>$</span> mkdir try-gitless
<span>$</span> cd try-gitless/
<span>$</span> gl init https://github.com/gitless-vcs/try-gitless
<span>✔ Local repo created in /MyFiles/try-gitless</span>
<span>✔ Initialized from remote https://github.com/gitless-vcs/try-gitless</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
      If you don&#39;t have a remote repository yet, you can follow
      <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/">these instructions</a> to create one on
      GitHub.
      </p>

      <a id="changes"><h3>Saving Changes</h3></a>
      <p>
      Now that you have your local repository, it&#39;s time to start saving
      changes to files. A file in Gitless can be <em>tracked</em>,
      <em>untracked</em> or <em>ignored</em>.
      A <em>tracked file</em> is a file whose changes Gitless will detect.
      Tracked files are automatically considered for commit if they are
      modified and appear listed under the &#34;Tracked files with modifications&#34;
      section of <code>status</code>.
      Conversely, an <em>untracked file</em> is a file whose changes Gitless
      will not detect. These are not automatically considered for commit and
      appear listed under the &#34;Untracked files&#34; section of
      <code>status</code>.
      Finally, an <em>ignored file</em> is a file that is completely ignored by
      Gitless and it won&#39;t even appear in the output of <code>status</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      An example output of the <code><a id="gl-status">gl status</a></code>
      command
      (<code>foo.py</code> and <code>bar.py</code> are tracked files
      with modifications, <code>.gitignore</code> is an unmodified tracked file,
      <code>baz.py</code> is an untracked file and <code>foo.pyc</code> is an
      ignored file):
      </p>
      <div>
      <pre><code><span>$</span> ls
bar.py  baz.py  foo.py  foo.pyc .gitignore
<span>$</span> gl status
On branch <span>master</span>, repo-directory <span>//</span>

Tracked files with modifications:
  ➜ these will be automatically considered for commit
  ➜ use gl untrack &lt;f&gt; if you don&#39;t want to track changes to file f
  ➜ if file f was committed before, use gl checkout &lt;f&gt; to discard local changes

    <span>foo.py</span>
    <span>bar.py</span>

Untracked files:
  ➜ these won&#39;t be considered for commit)
  ➜ use gl track &lt;f&gt; if you want to track changes to file f

    <span>baz.py</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
      Now, how do files move between these three different <em>disjoint</em>
      states?
      </p>
      <p>
      A file is ignored if it&#39;s matched by the ignore specification described in
      a <code>.gitignore</code> file.
      In the example above,
      there is a <code>.gitignore</code> file whose content is &#39;*.pyc&#39;; since
      <code>foo.pyc</code> is matched by that pattern it&#39;s therefore an
      ignored file.
      </p>
      <p>
      A new file that is not matched by the ignore spec is initially an untracked
      file. If you want to track it you can do so with the
      <code><a id="gl-track">gl track</a></code> command. You can stop tracking
      changes to a tracked file
      with the <code><a id="gl-untrack">gl untrack</a></code> command.
      You can always revert a file back to some previous version with the
      <code><a id="gl-checkout">gl checkout</a></code> command.
      </p>
      <div>
      <pre><code><span>$</span> gl track baz.py
<span>✔ File baz.py is now a tracked file</span>
<span>$</span> gl track baz.py
<span>✘ File baz.py is already a tracked file</span>
<span>$</span> gl untrack baz.py
<span>✔ File baz.py is now an untracked file</span>
<span>$</span> gl checkout foo.py
You have uncommitted changes in foo.py that would be
overwritten by checkout. Do you wish to continue? (y/N)
&gt; y
<span>✔ File foo.py checked out successfully to its state at HEAD</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
      To save changes to files you use
      <code><a id="gl-commit">gl commit</a></code>.
      By default, all tracked modified files are considered
      for commit, but the set of files to commit can be customized by listing
      the files to be committed only, or using the <code>e/exclude</code> and <code>i/include</code>
      flags:
      </p>
      <div>
      <pre><code><span>$</span> gl commit -m &#34;foo and bar&#34;
<span>$</span> gl commit -m &#34;only foo&#34; foo.py
<span>$</span> gl commit -m &#34;only foo and baz&#34; foo.py baz.py
<span>$</span> gl commit -m &#34;only foo&#34; -e bar.py
<span>$</span> gl commit -m &#34;only foo and baz&#34; -e bar.py -i baz.py
<span>$</span> gl commit -m &#34;foo, bar and baz&#34; -i baz.py</code></pre></div>
      <p>
      There&#39;s also a <code>p/partial</code> flag that allows you to
      interactively select segments of files to commit.
      </p><p>
      The <code><a id="gl-diff">gl diff</a></code> command can be used to see the
      difference between the working and committed versions of files. Like
      <code>commit</code>, the default set of files to diff is
      the set of all tracked modified files but it can be customized by
      listing files, or using the <code>e/exclude</code> and <code>i/include</code>
      flags.
      </p>
      <p>
        To remove files simply do it like you would in
        your operating system (e.g., using Unix&#39;s <code>rm</code> command). Gitless
        will detect the change if the file was tracked, and it will appear as removed
        in <code>status</code>. Gitless currently doesn&#39;t detect renames. If you rename a file,
        Gitless will interpret this as a file with the old name being removed and a new one
        (with the new name and content) being created. If you want the renamed file to be tracked
        again you need to track it with <code>gl track</code>.
      </p>


      <a id="branching"><h3>Branching</h3></a>
      <p>
      A branch is an independent line of development. You are always working
      on some branch. Each branch has its own history (which you can look at
      with the <a id="gl-history">gl history</a> command). Any changes to
      existing files or new files you create on a branch will not be present on
      the other branch when you switch branches.
      </p>
      <p>To create a new branch you use the
      <a id="gl-branch">gl branch</a>
      command. To switch to another branch you use the
      <a id="gl-switch">gl switch</a> command:
      </p>
      <div>
      <pre><code><span>$</span> gl branch -c develop
<span>✔ Created new branch develop</span>
<span>$</span> gl switch develop
<span>✔ Switched to branch develop</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
      To list all branches:
      </p>
      <div>
      <pre><code><span>$</span> gl branch
List of branches:
  ➜ do gl branch &lt;b&gt; to create branch b
  ➜ do gl branch -d &lt;b&gt; to delete branch b
  ➜ do gl switch &lt;b&gt; to switch to branch b
  ➜ * = current branch

    <span>* master</span>
      <span>develop</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
      Each branch has a head, which is the last commit done on the branch.
      By default, the head of a new branch is going to be equal to the
      head of the current branch. If you want a different commit to be the
      head of the new branch you can provide one with the
      <code>dp/divergent-point</code> flag.
      </p>
      <p>
      To specify a commit you can use its id, or you can specify it via an ancestry
      reference with <code>~</code>: <code>HEAD~n</code> refers to
      the nth commit before head.
      </p>
      <p>
      To change the head of the current branch you use the <code>sh/set-head</code> flag.
      The <code>sh</code> flag is useful to, for example, amend the last commit:
      to do so, run <code>gl branch -sh HEAD~1</code>.
      Changing the head of the current branch won&#39;t touch your working directory, if you
      additionally want to reset your working directory to match the new head
      you use <code>gl checkout</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Eventually branches will end up having divergent
      changes. There are two ways to bring changes from one branch onto the
      current branch: <em>merge</em> and <em>fuse</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Merging branches.</em>
      For merging the changes in <code>develop</code> onto the current branch
      you do <code><a id="gl-merge">gl merge develop</a></code>. This creates
      a new merge commit that includes the changes in <code>develop</code> in
      addition to those changes in the current branch:
      </p>
      <p><img src="https://gitless.com/merge.png" alt="merge"/>
      </p>


      <p>
      <em>Fusing branches.</em> Fusing branches gives you more control than
      merging. When you fuse changes from some branch onto the
      current branch you can specify the commits to fuse and the insertion
      point. By default, all divergent commits are fused and the insertion
      point is the divergent point (the point where the source branch diverged
      from the current).
      For example, the following figure depicts a situation in which there are
      two branches: <code>master</code> (the current branch) and
      <code>develop</code>. The last commit these two branches have in common is
      <code>A</code>. This commit is the &#34;divergent point&#34; (because
      it is the point at which <code>master</code> and <code>develop</code>
      diverged).
      After doing <code><a id="gl-fuse">gl fuse develop</a></code>, the commits
      in <code>develop</code> are inserted in <code>master</code> after the
      divergent point:
      </p>
      <p><img src="https://gitless.com/fuse.png" alt="fuse"/>
      </p>
      <p>
      To choose other insertion points you use the
      <code>ip/insertion-point</code> flag. You can give a commit id as input,
      <code>head</code> or <code>dp/divergent-point</code>:
      </p>
      <p><img src="https://gitless.com/fuse_ip.png" alt="fuse with insertion point specified"/>
      </p>
      <p>
      The <code>o/only</code> and <code>e/exclude</code> flags can be used to
      customize the set of commits to be fused:
      </p>
      <p><img src="https://gitless.com/fuse_ip_o.png" alt="fuse with insertion point and commit specified"/>
      </p>
      <p>
      During this process conflicts could occur. If so, the <code>gl status</code> command will change
      accordingly to indicate the files in conflict. Once you edit those files in
      conflict you mark them as resolved with
      <code><a id="gl-resolve">gl resolve</a></code> (passing the files to mark as input). Once all
      conflicts have been resolved
      you do <code>gl commit</code> to commit to continue with the fuse or
      merge.
      </p>
      <p>
      A branch can have an &#34;upstream branch.&#34; If a branch has an upstream
      associated with it, then <code>gl fuse</code> or <code>gl merge</code> can
      be used as shorthands for <code>gl {fuse, merge} upstream_branch</code>.
      To set an upstream branch for the current branch use
      <code>gl branch -su upstream_branch</code>.
      </p>


      <a id="tagging"><h3>Tagging</h3></a>
      <p>
      You use tags to signify a commit is special in some way. For example, you
      can use <code><a id="gl-tag">gl tag</a></code> to create a tag with name
      &#34;v1.0&#34; and make it point to the commit that represents release v1.0:
      </p>
      <div>
      <pre><code><span>$</span> gl tag -c v1.0
<span>✔ Created new tag v1.0</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>In this case, the tag will point to the head of the current branch, but
      you can tag other commits with the <code>ci/commit</code> flag.
      </p>
      <p>
      To list all tags:
      </p>
      <div>
      <pre><code><span>$</span> gl tag
List of tags:
  ➜ do gl tag &lt;t&gt; to create tag t
  ➜ do gl tag -d &lt;t&gt; to delete tag t

    v1.0 ➜  tags <span>311bf7c</span> Ready to release
</code></pre>
      </div>


      <a id="remote"><h3>Working with Remote Repositories</h3></a>
      <p>
      To refer to a remote repository you could always use its URL, but an
      easier alternative is to add the repository as a &#34;remote&#34; with the
      <code><a id="gl-remote">gl remote</a></code> command:
      </p>
      <div><pre><code><span>$</span> gl remote -c try-gitless https://github.com/gitless-vcs/try-gitless
<span>✔ Remote try-gitless mapping to https://github.com/gitless-vcs/try-gitless created
successfully</span>
  ➜ to list existing remotes do gl remote
  ➜ to remove try-gitless do gl remote -d try-gitless
</code></pre></div>
      <p>
      Now you can use <code>try-gitless</code> to refer to this remote repository
      and use <code>try-gitless/some-branch</code> to refer to the branch of name
      <code>some-branch</code> that lives in <code>try-gitless</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Downloading Changes.</em>
      It is also possible to fuse or merge changes from remote
      branches. For example, doing <code>gl merge try-gitless/master</code>
      would merge changes in that remote branch that are not present in your
      local current branch. You can also use <code>gl fuse</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Uploading Changes.</em>
      To send changes upstream you use
      <code><a id="gl-publish">gl publish</a></code>. The publish command will
      default to updating the upstream branch of the current branch if none is
      given as input.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Creating, Deleting, or Listing Remote Branches.</em>
      To create, delete, or list remote branches you use the same <code>gl branch</code>
      command that you use for local branches. If you do
      <code>gl branch -c try-gitless/develop</code> this will create a branch
      <code>develop</code> that lives in the remote <code>try-gitless</code>.
      Recall that, by default, the head of this new branch will be equal to the head of
      the current branch, so all commits that are not present in the remote
      will be uploaded. To list remote branches use the
      <code>r/remote</code> flag of <code>gl branch</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Creating, Deleting, or Listing Remote Tags.</em>
      To create or delete remote tags you use the <code>gl tag</code> command.
      If you do
      <code>gl tag -c try-gitless/v1.0</code> this will create a new tag
      <code>v1.0</code> that lives in the remote <code>try-gitless</code>. You can also list
      remote tags with the <code>r/remote</code> flag of <code>gl tag</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      When you create a local repository from a remote (by passing a URL as
      input to the <code>gl init</code> command), a local branch is created
      for each remote branch, and each local branch is automatically configured
      to have as upstream its remote counterpart.

      <h2>Saving Changes</h2>
      <p>There&#39;s no staging area in Gitless. This, coupled with a flexible
      commit command makes saving changes to the repository very
      straightforward:
      </p>

      <div>
        <pre><code><span>Commit all modified tracked files</span>
<span>$</span> gl commit


<span>Leave some modified tracked files (`foo`, `bar`)

      <h2>Branching</h2>
      <p>
      The main thing to understand is that in Gitless a branch is a completely
      independent line of development. Each branch keeps its working version
      of files separate from each other. Whenever you switch to a different
      branch, the contents of your working directory are saved, and the ones
      corresponding to the branch you are switching to are retrieved. The
      classifications of files are also saved (i.e., a file can
      be untracked on some branch but tracked on another and Gitless will
      remember this):
      </p>
      <div>
        <pre><code><span>$</span> gl status
...
Tracked files with modifications:
...
  <span>foo</span>
...

<span>Create new branch `develop`</span>
<span>$</span> gl branch -c develop
<span>✔ Created new branch develop</span>

<span>Switch to `develop`</span>
<span>$</span> gl switch develop
<span>✔ Switched to branch develop</span>
<span>$</span> gl status





<span>Switch back to `master`</span>
<span>$</span> gl switch master

      <p>
      This means that in Gitless you don&#39;t have to worry about uncommitted
      changes conflicting with the changes in the destination branch:
      </p>
      <div>
        <pre><code>

<span>Switch to `develop`</span>
<span>$</span> gl switch develop
<span>✔ Switched to branch develop</span>

</pre>
<pre><code>

<span>Switch to `develop`</span>

would be overwritten by checkout:

      And if you are in the middle of a fuse/merge and you want to put aside
      the conflict resolution for later, you can. The conflict will be there
      when you switch back:
