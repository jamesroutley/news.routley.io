    <h1>Commoncog is Off for the Chinese New Year</h1>
    
    <img src="https://commoncog.com/content/images/2023/01/commoncog_cny_2023.jpg" alt="Commoncog is Off for the Chinese New Year"><p>Happy Chinese New Year (if you celebrate it!)</p><p>This is a short announcement that I&apos;m going to be off for two weeks &#x2014; this week and the next, due to the Chinese New Year celebrations. Commoncog will be back on the week of the 30th January.</p><p>I thought I&apos;d be able to publish a follow-up essay to last week&apos;s Goodhart&apos;s Law piece, but it turns out that it&apos;s rather difficult to lay out the intuitions around process control charts (especially when travelling and doing other festival prep things). So expect that after the CNY holidays are over.</p><p>If you&apos;re not currently on the newsletter &#x2014; earlier this month we released an <a href="https://commoncog.com/case/the-ipod-case/">iPod case study</a> as part of the <a href="https://commoncog.com/tw/">Technological Windows concept</a>, albeit for members only. I&#x2019;ve also added a freely-available concept piece titled <a href="https://commoncog.com/case/tech-window-shape/">The Shape of a Technological Window</a>, an adaptation of last year&apos;s blog post, to the overall Tech Windows sequence. That should make it easier to spot patterns if you read the cases in order.</p><p>(Of course, if you&apos;re not currently on the newsletter, I highly recommend you <a href="https://commoncog.com/subscribe-to-the-commonplace-newsletter/">sign up!</a>)</p><p>As a result of this holiday, I&apos;m also on a break from my Judo accelerated expertise experiment, and my body is thanking me. I hope to write about that soon.</p><p>I&apos;ll see you the week after.</p>
