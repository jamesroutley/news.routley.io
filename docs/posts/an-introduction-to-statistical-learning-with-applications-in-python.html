  <p>As the scale and scope of data collection continue to increase across virtually all fields, statistical learning has become a critical toolkit for anyone who wishes to understand data. <em>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</em> provides a broad and less technical treatment of key topics in statistical learning. This book is appropriate for anyone who wishes to use contemporary tools for data analysis. </p><p>The first edition of this book, with applications in R (ISLR), was released in 2013. A 2nd Edition of ISLR was published in 2021. It has been translated into Chinese, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Russian, and Vietnamese. The Python edition (ISLP) was published in 2023.</p><p>Each edition contains a lab at the end of each chapter, which demonstrates the chapterâ€™s concepts in either R or Python. </p>
