    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>The Future of AI Delivered on Time</p><div><p>Paper Released Sep 30, 2025</p><p>Stanford Repo Released Oct 1, 2025</p></div></div><section><p>AI understands text, images, audio, and video.</p><p>Every heartbeat, price tick, sensor pulse, machine log, and user click is a temporal signal.</p><p>We&#39;re changing that.</p></section><section><h2>A New Class of Foundation Models</h2><div><p><span>Time-Series Language Models (TSLMs)</span> are multimodal foundation models with time series as a native modality, next to text, enabling direct reasoning, explanation, and forecasting over temporal data in natural language.</p><p>Our research shows order-of-magnitude gains in temporal reasoning while running on smaller, faster backbones. TSLMs are not an add-on. They&#39;re a new modality for AI.</p></div></section><section><h2>Open Core, Frontier Edge</h2><div><div><p><span>OpenTSLM:</span> Lightweight base models trained on public data, released openly. They set the standard for temporal reasoning and power a global developer and research ecosystem.</p><p><span>Frontier TSLMs:</span> Advanced proprietary models trained on specialized data, delivering enterprise-grade performance and powering APIs, fine-tuning, and vertical solutions.</p></div></div></section><section><h2>Our Vision</h2><div><p>We&#39;re building the temporal interface for AI - the layer that connects continuous real-world signals to intelligent decisions and autonomous agents.</p><p>A universal TSLM will power proactive healthcare, adaptive robotics, resilient infrastructure, and new forms of human-AI collaboration.</p></div></section><section><h2>About Us</h2><p>OpenTSLM is a team of scientists, engineers, and builders from ETH, Stanford, Harvard, Cambridge, TUM, CDTM, Google, Meta, AWS, and beyond.
