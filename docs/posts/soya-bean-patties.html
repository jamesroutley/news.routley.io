<p><span id="more-17116"></span>I am thinking of cake, of course, but Junior 2 came up with an idea to use the leftover soya bean pulp (okara) from our foray into making <a href="https://gochugarugirl.com/2022/03/thermomix-soya-milk/">soya milk</a>. I was unsure how the patties were going to turn out, but once we started we were quite inspired by what else we could do with the okara.</p>
<p>The taste and texture of the patties reminded me of mashed potato cakes, but a bit more dense and rich. I can see why okara is used as animal feed or plant fertiliser as it tastes as if it could be good for you. It is not marketable as it does not last in its fresh form for more than a day or two, on account of its moisture and nutrient content. If you are considering making these patties or using the okara in baked goods, please use it as soon as you can after making the soya milk.</p>
<p>Junior 2 found <a href="https://woonheng.com/soybean-pulp-okara-patty/">this recipe</a> by a <a href="https://woonheng.com/">Malaysian vegan blogger</a>. Looking through it, I would not mind making one or two vegan dishes from there. However I must say that whilst frying the patties I was already thinking of how I could turn them into salmon fishcakes or adding parmesan and bacon into the mix. And how about serving it for breakfast with a poached egg on top?</p>

<p>I made two batches of soya milk and each batch yielded around 350 g of leftover soya bean pulp. The recipe here uses 500 g of the pulp and makes around a dozen patties. I have given a recipe using 350 g of the pulp at the end of the post. You can get ready chopped seaweed (for eating, not cooking) in Korean and Japanese supermarkets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Patties:</p>
<p>500 g okara (soya bean pulp)</p>
<p>90 g sweet pepper, finely diced</p>
<p>35 g spring onion, finely chopped</p>
<p>6 g red chilli, finely chopped</p>
<p>2 tablespoons chopped seaweed</p>
<p>100 g plain flour</p>
<p>20 g cornflour</p>
<p>1½ teaspoons salt</p>
<p>freshly ground black pepper</p>
<p>100 g water, plus more if needed</p>
<p>sunflower oil for frying</p>
<p>Sriracha chilli sauce and Kewpie mayonnaise to serve, because I had run out of <a href="https://linghams.uk/">Lingham&#8217;s</a> sweet chilli sauce</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to Make:</p>
<p>Place all the ingredients except the water and oil into a large mixing bowl.</p>
<p>Mix everything with your hand until well combined.</p>
<p>Slowly pour the water over the mixture and continue pressing / squeezing until you achieve a slightly wet paste.</p>
<p>To make even-sized patties, you can either weigh out the mix and divide by 12, or use a large ice cream scoop to portion out.</p>
<p>Shaped individual patties, place on a tray and let them rest for a few minutes in the fridge to firm them up.</p>
<p>When you are ready to cook, heat a thin layer of oil in a non-stick frying pan.</p>
<p>Gently place the patties in the pan and cook over a medium heat. Turn them over when the bottom is browned and continue frying until done. You may need to add a little more oil.</p>
<p>To ensure the patties were cooked through, we heated them in an oven at 150 C / 135 C fan for 20 minutes.</p>
