<p>Women between the ages of 25 and 34 continue to be more likely than men in the same age group to have a bachelor’s degree. The gender gap in bachelor’s degree completion appears in every major racial or ethnic group, though the size of the gap varies widely.</p>

<p>In 1995, young men and women were equally likely to hold a bachelor’s degree (25% each). Since then, there has been a growing gap between men and women in college completion.  </p>



<p>Today, 47% of U.S. women ages 25 to 34 have a bachelor’s degree, compared with 37% of men.</p>



<p>The share of young women with a bachelor’s degree has increased by 22 percentage points since 1995, from 25% to 47%. Over the same period, men have seen a smaller increase (12 points, from 25% to 37%).</p>

<p>Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to better understand the demographic characteristics driving the gender gap in bachelor’s degree completion in the United States.</p>



<p>This analysis uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s <a href="https://cps.ipums.org/cps/">Current Population Survey</a> (CPS) Annual Social and Economic Supplement for 1995 to 2024. The CPS microdata files analyzed were provided by the <a href="https://cps.ipums.org/cps/index.shtml">Integrated Public Use Microdata Series</a> (IPUMS) at the University of Minnesota. The <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/saipe/guidance/model-input-data/cpsasec.html">Annual Social and Economic Supplement</a> (ASEC) of the CPS is conducted in March of each year and typically features an expanded sample of more than 75,000 households with about 70,000 interviews.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/11/08/whats-behind-the-growing-gap-between-men-and-women-in-college-completion/">2021 Pew Research Center survey</a> asked Americans without a bachelor’s degree why they chose not to seek one – and found some gender differences in the responses. For example, men without a bachelor’s degree were more likely than women to say they <em>just didn’t want to get one</em>. In turn, women without a bachelor’s degree were more likely than men to say they <em>couldn’t afford a four-year degree</em>.</p>

<p>White, Black, Hispanic and Asian women between the ages of 25 and 34 are all more likely than their male counterparts to have a bachelor’s degree. But some groups have made more gains over time than others.</p>

<p>White, Black and Hispanic women have outpaced men in college completion in recent decades. For example, in 1995, young White women and men were equally likely to have a bachelor’s degree (29% each). The gap has increased to 10 points today (52% of White women vs. 42% of White men).</p>



<p>Similarly, in 1995, young Black women and men were about equally likely to have a bachelor’s degree (14% vs. 16%). Today, Black women are 12 points more likely than Black men to have one (38% of Black women vs. 26% of Black men).</p>



<p>There is also a growing gender gap between Hispanic men and women in college completion. In 1995, similar shares of Hispanic women and men had a bachelor’s degree (10% vs. 9%), but today the gap between groups is 9 points (31% vs. 22%).</p>



<p>The pattern is different for Asian adults, with women and men making comparable gains over the last few decades. In 1995, 42% of young Asian women and men had a bachelor’s degree. Today, 77% of young Asian women have one, as do 71% of young Asian men.</p>
