                        Brave Talk is available on the most up-to-date version of the Brave Browser, on desktop and mobile.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Yes and no. To start a call, you’ll need to be on the Brave browser. However, people you invite to a call can join from any browser. They just need the call link.
                    </p>
                </li>
            
                <li>

                    <div>
                        <p>Yes! Brave Talk is available as an extension in the Chrome web store. To add a Talk link directly to a Google Calendar meeting invite, simply <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/brave-talk-for-google-cal/nimfmkdcckklbkhjjkmbjfcpaiifgamg">install the extension in the Brave Browser</a>. Then log in to Google Calendar and click <strong>Create</strong>. You’ll see <strong>Add a Brave Talk meeting</strong> as a video calling option, just like Zoom or Google Meet.</p>
<p>Note that the Brave Browser is built on the open-source Chromium web core. This means that extensions in the Chrome web store will also work in Brave, and can be downloaded in the same way.</p>
<p>For now, the extension is only available on Google Calendar. But we hope to add support for other calendar formats in the future.</p>

                    </div>
                </li>
            
                <li>
                    <h3>
                        
                    </h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>To start, all video and audio data transferred through Brave Talk is encrypted via transport layer encryption. This is similar to how many websites use HTTPS to ensure your traffic can’t be captured on public networks (e.g. coffee shop WiFi).</p>
<p>The video and audio from your call are transmitted to other participants with the help of a Video Bridge server that’s run by Brave’s partner, 8x8. When you enable <strong>Video Bridge Encryption</strong> in <strong>Security Options</strong>, your browser exchanges keys with other call participants, and these keys are used to encrypt the video and audio streams. Only people with keys can see your calls. Assuming no malevolence, neither Brave nor its partner, 8x8, have this key by default.</p>
<p>However, there are some important limits to Video Bridge Encryption. If you want to include a phone participant in your call, have more than 20 participants, or want to include users with incompatible browsers (Safari, most iOS browsers, and browsers based on Chromium version 83 or below), this encryption setting will not work. If you record a call, 8x8’s servers will receive a set of keys to decrypt the video/audio stream in order to process and store that recording. Brave will continue to improve Brave Talk’s encryption properties and work to remove some of these limitations.</p>
