    <h1>Fortune-500 company expects answers about Log4j vulnerability from curl dev</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Friday January 21, 2022 I received this email. I <a href="https://twitter.com/bagder/status/1484672924036616195">tweeted about it</a> and it took off like crazy.</p>



<p>The email comes from a fortune-500 multi-billion dollar company that apparently might be using a product that contains my code, or maybe they have customers who do. Who knows?</p>



<p>My guess is that they do this for some compliance reasons and they “forgot” that their open source components are not automatically provided by “partners” they can just demand this information from.</p>



<p>I answered the email very briefly and said I will be happy to answer with details as soon as we have a support contract signed. </p>



<p>I think maybe this serves as a good example of the <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2022/01/17/enforcing-the-pyramid-of-open-source/" data-type="post" data-id="18034">open source pyramid</a> and users in the upper layers not at all thinking of how the lower layers are maintained. Building a house without a care about the ground the house stands on.</p>



<p>In my tweet and here in my blog post I redact the name of the company. I most probably have the right to tell you who they are, but I still prefer to not. (Especially if I manage to land a profitable business contract with them.) I suspect we can find this level of entitlement in many companies.</p>



<p>The level of ignorance and incompetence shown in this single email is mind-boggling.</p>



<p>While they don’t even specifically say which product they are using, no code I’ve ever been involved with or have my copyright use log4j and any rookie or better engineer could easily verify that.</p>



<p>In the picture version of the email I padded the name fields to better anonymize the sender, and in the text below I replaced them with NNNN.</p>



<p>(And yes, it is very curious that they send queries about log4j <em>now</em>, seemingly very late.)</p>



<p>Continue down for the reply.</p>

<h2>The reply</h2>



<p>On January 24th I received this response, from the same address and it quotes my reply so I know they got it fine.</p>



<pre>Hi David,

Thank you for your reply. Are you saying that we are not a customer of your organization?
