    <h1>Popular Linux orgs Freedesktop and Alpine Linux are scrambling for new webhost</h1>

<p>Having worked &#34;around the clock&#34; to move from Google Cloud Platform after its open source credits there ran out, and now rushing to move off Equinix, Tissoires suggests a new plan: &#34;[H]ave [freedesktop.org] pay for its own servers, and then have sponsors chip in.&#34;</p>
<h2>“Popular without most users knowing it”</h2>
<p>Alpine Linux, a small, security-minded distribution used in many containers and embedded devices, also needs a new home quickly. As <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/posts/Seeking-Support-After-Equinix-Metal-Sunsets.html">detailed in its blog</a>, Alpine Linux uses about 800TB of bandwidth each month and also needs continuous integration runners (or separate job agents), as well as a development box. Alpine states it is seeking co-location space and bare-metal servers near the Netherlands, though it will consider virtual machines if bare metal is not feasible.</p>
<p>Like X.org/Freedesktop, Alpine is using this moment as a wake-up call. Responding to Ars, Carlo Landmeter, who serves on Alpine&#39;s council, noted that Alpine Linux is a kind of open source project &#34;that became popular without most users knowing it.&#34; Users are starting to donate, and companies are reaching out to help, but it&#39;s still &#34;early days,&#34; Landmeter wrote.</p>
<p>Every so often, those working at the foundations of open source software experience something that highlights <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/04/tech-giants-chastened-by-heartbleed-finally-agree-to-fund-openssl/">the mismatch between a project&#39;s importance and its support and funding</a>. Perhaps some people or some organizations will do the harder work of finding a sustaining future for these projects.</p>
<p>Ars has reached out to Equinix and X/Freedesktop and will update this post with responses.</p>
