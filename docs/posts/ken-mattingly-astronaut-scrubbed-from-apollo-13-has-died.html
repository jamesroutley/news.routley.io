He was 87.</p><p>His death was confirmed by Cheryl Warner, a NASA spokeswoman. She did not specify the cause or say whether he died at home in Arlington or in a hospital there.</p><p>Mr. Mattingly, a former Navy jet pilot with a degree in aeronautical engineering, joined NASA in 1966. But his first spaceflight didn’t come until April 1972, when the space agency launched Apollo 16, the next-to-last manned mission to the moon.</p><p>Piloting the spacecraft’s command module in orbit while holding the rank of lieutenant commander, he took extensive photos of the moon’s terrain and conducted experiments while Cmdr. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/06/obituaries/john-young-dead.html" title="">John W. Young</a> of the Navy and Lt. Col. Charles M. Duke Jr. of the Air Force, having descended in the lunar lander, collected rock and soil samples from highlands near the crater known as Descartes.</p></div></div><div><div><p>While the three astronauts were en route back to Earth, Commander Mattingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/26/archives/apollo-16-course-to-earth-refined-mattingly-walks-in-space-to.html" title="">stepped outside the spacecraft</a> — which he had named Casper for the resemblance, as least in a child’s eye, between an astronaut in a bulky spacesuit and the cartoon character Casper the Friendly Ghost.</p><p>Maneuvering along handrails while connected to the spacecraft by a tether, he retrieved two attached canisters of film with photos of the moon that he had taken from inside the capsule for analysis back on Earth.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Mr. Mattingly, right, during a spacewalk on April 25, 1972, as part of the Apollo 16 mission.

He was also the commander of the first space shuttle flight conducted for the Department of Defense, a classified January 1985 mission aboard Discovery.</p></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">The Apollo 16 crew during training in the Gulf of Mexico in 1972.

Haise Jr. explored the lunar surface.</p><p>But NASA removed Commander Mattingly from the crew in the final days before launching, when blood tests determined that he had recently been exposed to German measles from training with Colonel Duke, the backup lunar module pilot, who in turn had contracted it from his proximity to an infected child at a neighborhood party. Commander Mattingly was the only one of the Apollo 13 crewmen who were found to lack antibodies against the illness.</p><p>His backup, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/29/obituaries/jack-swigert-astronaut-elected-to-congress-dies.html" title="">John L. Swigert Jr.</a>, became the command module pilot, leaving Commander Mattingly to watch the progress of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/science/apollo-13-anniversary.html" title="">the flight</a> from mission control.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Mr. Mattingly, left, at mission control in Houston during the flight of Apollo 13 in 1970.

The lunar module and the heavily damaged service module were jettisoned, and the astronauts touched down in the Pacific. They where flown aboard a helicopter to the recovery ship, the aircraft carrier Iwo Jima.</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Mr. Mattingly, standing at left, in the mission control operations room in Houston during the Apollo 13 mission.</span><span><span>Credit...</span><span><span aria-hidden="false">NASA</span></span></span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><p>The harrowing episode was recounted in the 1995 Hollywood film “Apollo 13,” in which Commander Mattingly was played by Gary Sinise.</p></div><div><div><p>Thomas Kenneth Mattingly II, known to his colleagues as Ken, was born in Chicago on March 17, 1936, and grew up in the Miami area, where his father worked for Eastern Airlines.</p><p>“I built every model airplane that I could find, ate every box of cereal that had a cutout paper airplane on the back,” he told NASA in a 2001 oral history interview.</p><p>His father secured passes for him to fly on Eastern between Miami and New York. As Mr. Mattingly recalled, “If you went up the East Coast from Miami, up north and back, that was a long day.”</p></div></div><div><div data-testid="photoviewer-wrapper"><div data-testid="photoviewer-children"><figure aria-label="media" role="group"><div><p><span>Image</span></p><div data-testid="lazy-image"></div></div><figcaption><span aria-hidden="false">Mr. Mattingly in 2019.

He retired from the space agency and the Navy as a rear admiral and went on to work for aerospace companies.</p><p>His survivors include his wife, Kathleen (Ruemmele) Mattingly, and a son, Thomas III. </p><p>When “Apollo 13” was released, Mr. Mattingly fielded questions anew about missing out on the flight.</p><p>“It was very painful to be told a couple of days before launch that you are not going to go, but there was so much invested in this mission that it really was the only choice,” he said in an interview with Auburn University.</p><p>He added that over the years he wondered what would have happened if he had been on the flight. “But I can guarantee you from a feelings point of view,” he said, “I would have rather been there, no matter what happened.”</p><p>Alex Traub<!-- --> contributed reporting.</p></div></div></section></article></div>
