    <h1>Researchers discover security vulnerability in WhatsApp</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><div><p><strong>IT-Security Researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research identified and responsibly disclosed a large-scale privacy weakness in WhatsApp&#39;s contact discovery mechanism that allowed the enumeration of 3.5 billion accounts. In collaboration with the researchers, Meta has since addressed and mitigated the issue. The study underscores the importance of continuous, independent security research on widely used communication platforms and highlights the risks associated with the centralization of instant messaging services. The preprint of the study has now been published, and the results will be presented in 2026 at the Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium.</strong></p><p>WhatsApp&#39;s contact discovery mechanism can use a user&#39;s address book to find other WhatsApp users by their phone number. Using the same underlying mechanism, the researchers demonstrated that it was possible to query more than 100 million phone numbers per hour through WhatsApp&#39;s infrastructure, confirming more than 3.5 billion active accounts across 245 countries. &#34;Normally, a system shouldn&#39;t respond to such a high number of requests in such a short time — particularly when originating from a single source,&#34; explains lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna. &#34;This behavior exposed the underlying flaw, which allowed us to issue an effectively unlimited requests to the server and, in doing so, map user data worldwide.&#34;</p><p>The accessible data items used in the study are the same that are public for anyone who knows a user&#39;s phone number and consist of: phone number, public keys, timestamps, and, if set to public, about text and profile picture. From these data points, the researchers were able to extract additional information, which allowed them to infer a user&#39;s operating system, account age, as well as the number of linked companion devices. The study shows that even this limited amount of data per user can reveal important information, both on macroscopic and individual levels.</p><h2>The study also revealed a range of broader insights:</h2><ul><li>Millions of active WhatsApp accounts were identified in countries where the platform was officially banned, including China, Iran, and Myanmar.</li><li>Population-level insights into platform usage, such as the global distribution of Android (81%) versus iOS (19%) devices, regional differences in privacy behavior (e.g., use of public profile pictures or &#34;about&#34; tagline), and variations in user growth across countries.</li><li>A small number of cases showed re-use of cryptographic keys across different devices or phone numbers, pointing to potential weaknesses in non-official WhatsApp clients or fraudulent use.</li><li>Nearly half of all phone numbers that appeared in the 2021 Facebook data leak of 500 million phone numbers (caused by a scraping incident in 2018) were still active on WhatsApp. This highlights the enduring risks for leaked numbers (e.g., being targeted in scam calls) associated with such exposures.</li></ul><p>The study did not involve access to message content, and no personal data was published or shared. All retrieved data was deleted by the researchers prior to publication. Message content on WhatsApp is “end-to-end encrypted” and was not affected at any time. “This end-to-end encryption protects the content of messages, but not necessarily the associated metadata,” explains last author Aljosha Judmayer from the University of Vienna. “Our work shows that privacy risks can also arise when such metadata is collected and analysed on a large scale.”</p><p>“These findings remind us that even mature, widely trusted systems can contain design or implementation flaws that have real-world consequences,&#34; says lead author Gabriel Gegenhuber from the University of Vienna: &#34;They show that security and privacy are not one-time achievements, but must be continuously re-evaluated as technology evolves.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Building on our previous findings on delivery receipts and key management, we are contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve and where new risks arise,&#34; adds co-author Maximilian Günther from the University of Vienna.</p><p>“We are grateful to the University of Vienna researchers for their responsible partnership and diligence under our Bug Bounty program. This collaboration successfully identified a novel enumeration technique that surpassed our intended limits, allowing the researchers to scrape basic publicly available information. We had already been working on industry-leading anti-scraping systems, and this study was instrumental in stress-testing and confirming the immediate efficacy of these new defenses. Importantly, the researchers have securely deleted the data collected as part of the study, and we have found no evidence of malicious actors abusing this vector. As a reminder, user messages remained private and secure thanks to WhatsApp’s default end-to-end encryption, and no non-public data was accessible to the researchers”, says Nitin Gupta, Vice President of Engineering at WhatsApp. </p><h2>Ethical Handling and Disclosure</h2><p>The research was conducted with strict ethical guidelines and in accordance with responsible disclosure principles. The findings were promptly reported to Meta, the operator of WhatsApp, which has since implemented countermeasures (e.g., rate-limiting, stricter profile information visibility) to close the identified vulnerability. The authors argue that transparency, academic scrutiny, and independent testing are essential to maintaining trust in global communication services. They emphasize that proactive collaboration between researchers and industry can significantly improve user privacy and prevent abuse.</p><h2>Research Context</h2><p>This publication represents the third study by researchers from the University of Vienna and SBA Research examining the security and privacy of prevalent instant messengers such as WhatsApp and Signal. The team investigates how design and implementation choices in end-to-end encrypted messaging services can unintentionally expose user information or weaken privacy guarantees.</p><p>Earlier this year, the researchers published &#34;Careless Whisper: Exploiting Silent Delivery Receipts to Monitor Users on Mobile Instant Messengers&#34; (distinguished with the Best Paper Award at RAID 2025), which demonstrated how silent pings and their delivery receipts could be abused to infer user activity patterns and online behavior on WhatsApp and similar messaging platforms. Later that same year, &#34;Prekey Pogo: Investigating Security and Privacy Issues in WhatsApp&#39;s Handshake Mechanism&#34; (presented at USENIX WOOT 2025) analyzed the cryptographic foundations of WhatsApp&#39;s prekey distribution mechanism, revealing implementation weaknesses of the Signal-based protocol.</p><p>&#34;By building on our earlier findings about delivery receipts and key management, we&#39;re contributing to a long-term understanding of how messaging systems evolve, and where new risks emerge.&#34; said Maximilian Günther (University of Vienna).</p><p>The current study, &#34;Hey there! You are using WhatsApp: Enumerating Three Billion Accounts for Security and Privacy&#34;, extends this line of research to the global scope, showing how contact discovery mechanisms can unintentionally allow large-scale user enumeration at an unprecedented magnitude. It will appear in the proceedings of the NDSS Symposium 2026, one of the leading international conferences on computer and network security.</p><p><strong>Publication:</strong> Gabriel K.
