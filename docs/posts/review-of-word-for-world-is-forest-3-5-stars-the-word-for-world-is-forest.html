                        <p>This book is good on the whole, but quite heavy-handed, and I feel that sci-fi depictions of colonialism run the risk of distracting from understandings of real-world colonialism, rather than elucidating anything. Not my favorite from Le Guin, but I&#39;m happy to have read it.</p>
