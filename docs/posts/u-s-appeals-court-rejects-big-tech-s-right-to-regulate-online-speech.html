Twitter had cited &#34;the risk of further incitement of violence&#34; as a reason.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">The Texas law forbids social media companies with at least 50 million monthly active users from acting to &#34;censor&#34; users based on &#34;viewpoint,&#34; and allows either users or the Texas attorney general to sue to enforce the law.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on Twitter hailed the ruling as &#34;massive victory for the constitution and free speech.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Because the 5th Circuit ruling conflicts with part of a ruling by the 11th Circuit, the aggrieved parties have a stronger case for petitioning the Supreme Court to hear the matter.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">In May, the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, found that most of a similar Florida law violates the companies&#39; free speech rights and cannot be enforced. <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/us-appeals-court-rejects-most-florida-social-media-law-2022-05-23/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">(This story corrects to largely 2-1 ruling in second paragraph<b>)</b></p><div><div><h5 data-testid="Heading">Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span data-testid="Text">Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Leslie Adler</span></p><p data-testid="Body">Our Standards: <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
