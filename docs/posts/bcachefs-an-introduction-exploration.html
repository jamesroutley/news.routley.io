<h3 id="so-what-is-bcachefs">So what is bcachefs?</h3>
<p>bcachefs is a next-generation copy-on-write (COW) filesystem (FS) that aims to provide features similar to Btrfs and ZFS, written by Kent Overstreet</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy-on-write (COW), with goal of performance being better than other COW filesystems</li>
<li>Full checksums on everything</li>
<li>Mult-device, replication , RAID, Caching, Compression, Encryption</li>
<li>Sub-volumes, snapshots</li>
<li>Scalable, 50+ TB tested</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-the-need-for-another-fs">Why the need for another FS?</h3>
<p>According to Kent<a href="https://www.patreon.com/bcachefs/about?l=en">[1]</a>, paraphrased here</p>
<ul>
<li>ext4, functional but outdated, intimidates developers due to its codebase. Despite its flaws, it
surprisingly functions, with its fsck being its standout feature.</li>
<li>XFS, reliable and robust, follows a traditional update-in-place design, not COW. The developers,
especially Dave Chinner, impress with the code’s rigor, surpassing other filesystems. However,
lacking COW, XFS can’t support some desirable features.</li>
<li>Btrfs[2], envisioned as Linux’s next-gen COW filesystem akin to ZFS, suffered from rushed development,
resulting in numerous design flaws and a sprawling codebase larger than XFS. Its prolonged stabilization process
tarnished its reputation, leading to distrust among users and prompting migrations to other FS.</li>
<li>ZFS, pioneering COW filesystem, won’t be a first class citizen on Linux (copyright).
While commendable, its block-based design diverges from modern extent-based systems due to complexities in
implementing extents with snapshots.</li>
</ul>

</ol>
<h3 id="why-bcachefs1httpswwwpatreoncombcachefsaboutlen">Why bcachefs<a href="https://www.patreon.com/bcachefs/about?l=en">[1]</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Stability: Key in filesystem development. Building a POSIX filesystem involves tackling a vast array of functionalities, making incremental development challenging. However, bcachefs benefits from bcache’s stable foundation, extensive testing.</li>
<li>Fast: bcachefs excels in speed, with noticeable performance improvements since earlier benchmarks. It prioritizes low tail latency, avoiding extensive delays seen in other filesystems like ext4.</li>
<li>Small: bcachefs boasts a compact codebase, rivaling ext4’s size yet offering btrfs features. Constant refactorings ensure clarity, aiming for longevity by prioritizing developer accessibility and comprehension.</li>
<li>Features: It has, either finished or in progress, features we all need, especially data checksumming, which alone is sufficient reason for a good COW FS.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="full-checksums">Full checksums</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can detect and optionally correct data before it gets returned to userspace

<li>FS checksum doesn’t protect networked FS</li>

<li>Bit-rot is real, I have personal experience with it, an excerpt from an email (circa 2016) on the subject
<pre tabindex="0"><code>...
My home file server (ECC memory, SATA disks) runs CentOS6 and uses md
for a simple mirrored setup (ext4) with off-site backups run each night
to crashplan for newly created files (they do file versioning).  A while
back I read an article on bit rot and I ran the jpeginfo tool to check
my family photos that go back ~16 years.  I found ~100 images that are
corrupt out of ~50k.  I don&#39;t know when or how they got trashed, but
they are forever lost at this point (backups and all versions of backups are corrupt).
I have no idea what other files may be trashed as many of them don&#39;t have built in
file level checksums or tools to automate checking.  I would like to scrub
my data once a month, to verify correctness and address any issues that come up.
...
</code></pre></li>
<li>Disclaimer, my personal data is stored on ZFS, 10T mirror with monthly scrubs (ECC memory, enterprise SATA disks)</li>
<li>I would welcome a COW FS which is in kernel tree that has full checksums, error detection and correction, and won’t eat my data</li>

<h4 id="-help--man-pages">(-help &amp; man pages)</h4>
<ul>
<li>In general, documentation details are a bit lacking
<ul>
<li>Example: What does this all mean?
<ul>
<li>metadata_replicas:               2</li>
<li>data_replicas:                   2</li>
<li>metadata_replicas_required:      1</li>
<li>data_replicas_required:          1</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Much of what is scattered around the internet appears to be incorrect
<ul>
<li>Current understanding in a number of online resources about *<strong>_required</strong>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>_required</strong> versions means sync() won’t return until that many replicas are written; the others are the targets for the rebalance thread.</li>
<li>But actual IRC message from Kent is: <strong>can run in degraded mode if we’re only able to do this many writes</strong> (translation, the FS stays operational in RW mode)</li>

<li>There are good details in design documentation on implementation</li>

<ul>
<li>Single device with FS works with entry in fstab by FS uuid</li>
<li>Multi-device with FS works with entry in fstab by FS uuid with PR I submitted and was merged (thanks Kent!)</li>
<li>There is still an issue where if all the block devices are not present at boot, the mount will fail even though in some cases you can bring the FS up with a subset of the disks in degraded mode, solutions to this are still in progress
<ul>

<li>Investigation on how btrfs accomplishes this would be good</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mount-option-for-degraded">Mount option for degraded</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can do a standard mount, which won’t mount if your FS is degraded
<ul>
<li><code>mount /dev/sda /mnt</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mount in degraded mode, but your data is fully intact
<ul>
<li><code>mount -o degraded /dev/sda /mnt</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mount in very degraded mode, where data is likely missing, and you are trying to recover as much as you can
<ul>
<li><code>mount -o very_degraded /dev/sda /mnt</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently much of the implementation is available in user space, you can even run bcachefs as FUSE (not tested),
however there currently isn’t a high level API which provides functionality
<ul>
<li>When asked about adding something like this as a rust crate, Kent responded, <strong>“a rust API would be wonderful”</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The bcachefs command line is a combination of rust and C (lower levels)</li>
<li>IOCTL interface</li>
<li>sysfs, debugfs interfaces</li>
<li>Today, automation would mainly revolve around fork &amp; exec command line tool or sysfs interface</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sysfs-interface">sysfs interface</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many options can be changed after a FS has been formatted.  These configuration options are available in
sysfs and will be persistently changed in the superblock, see: <code>/sys/fs/bcachefs/UUID/options/</code></li>
<li>Time statistics, tracks latency and frequency of various things:</li>
<li>Other values for
<ul>
<li>Internals/data structure values</li>
<li>Tests, unit and performance of low level btree operations (optionally compiled in)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>From an automation standpoint, it might be easier to use some of these instead of forking &amp; execing the command line to make simple FS changes after it has been created</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="debugfs-interface">debugfs interface</h3>
<p><code>/sys/kernel/debug/bcachefs/&lt;FS UUID&gt;</code></p>

<li>We can only tolerate a 1 disk failure in this configuration, which was tested and found true.
In an actual RAID10 you can lose 1 disk in each leg of the mirror.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="raid-56-experimental">RAID 5/6 (experimental)</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is referred to as erasure coding and is listed as  <strong>“DO NOT USE YET”</strong>, experimental in kconfig
<ul>
<li><code>bcachefs format --erasure_code --metadata_replicas=3 –data_replicas=2 /dev/sdf /dev/sdg /dev/sdh</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>data_replicas is configuration knob used by the erasure code</li>
<li>Not available for metadata use</li>
<li>Not compiled in with default fedora kernel module</li>
<li>On disk format has not be formalized</li>
<li>Does not suffer from RAID5/6 <strong>write hole</strong>.  This is accomplished by writing copy to multiple disks and when enough data
to fill a full stripe is present, it then writes the stripe.  Fully protected, but at a cost of more writes, which in my
opinion is good!</li>

<h3 id="why-is-my-free-space--expected">Why is my free space &lt; expected?</h3>
<ul>
<li>~8% of total space reserved for garbage collection, can be configured
<ul>
<li>see <code>--gc_reserve_percent</code></li>
<li>see <code>--gc_reserve_bytes</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also depends on the number of copies of metadata</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multipath">multipath</h3>
<ul>
<li>The pull request I created which leverages the udev DB which was subsequently merged makes this work</li>
<li>NVMe native multipath should have always worked</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="block-device-management">Block device management</h3>
<ul>
<li>dynamically add/remove devices to a FS in use</li>
<li>evacuate data from a device, then remove it</li>
<li>correct a degraded FS</li>
<li>Take devices online/offline, mark block devices as failed</li>
<li>The documentation is a bit lacking on the exact order of steps, to do when a device fails, but I got it to work :-)</li>
<li>Current limit of 64 devices in a single FS</li>
<li>resize filesystem on a device (your disk capacity increases)</li>
<li>resize journal on a device</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="error-handling-on-crc-read-error">Error handling on CRC read error</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 copy of file, CRC error on read results in EIO
<ul>
<li>Future work item, add a read flag which says give me what you do have despite CRC errors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 or more copies of file, CRC on error, read other copy, data returned to userspace, does not correct bad copy
<ul>
<li>Correction is a future work item</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="things-not-explored">Things not explored</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are lots of other options and functionality that I didn’t evaluate
<ul>
<li>caching (write through, write back, write around)</li>
<li>no-COW mode</li>
<li>using custom durability settings</li>
<li>quotas</li>
<li>different checksums, compression algorithms</li>
<li>settings e.g. on journaling, targets, garbage collection. data I/O and more</li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<h3 id="work-in-progress">Work in progress</h3>
<ul>
<li>bcachefs is not complete</li>
<li>Kent is working very hard to ensure early adopters don’t ever lose data, even when they do some very questionable things</li>
<li>Any assistance/help is appreciated</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="specific-areas-that-could-use-some-help">Specific areas that could use some help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solution to multi-device FS and correct sequencing at boot which includes the option to mount in degraded mode if acceptable to end user
<ul>
<li>Need a good way to warn/alert a user when a FS is mounted degraded at boot</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change encrypt password entry to better integrate with systemd, e.g. <code>systemd-ask-password</code></li>
</ul>
