<p><em>Previous Topic: </em><a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/number-theory-primer-an-axiomatic-study-of-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An Axiomatic Study of Numbers</a></p>



<h4>Introduction</h4>



<p>Thinking of numbers intuitively brings to mind the simplest and most fundamental set of numbers, namely the <em>set of</em> <em>natural numbers</em>. These numbers are used to count objects like cars, books, pens, etc. If we associate natural numbers such as <span data-katex-display="false">1, 2, 3,</span> etc. with counting, then with what corresponding concepts do we relate numbers like <span data-katex-display="false">-4, \sqrt{3} \text{ and } \frac{22}{7}</span>?</p>



<p>To reason about all kinds of numbers encountered during our study of mathematics, we need a precise mathematical framework for defining numbers. We will build this framework by first rigorously defining natural numbers axiomatically without relying on the intuitive notion of counting. Then, using this framework as a foundation, we will construct all the other sets of numbers such as integers, rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers in terms of the natural numbers.</p>



<p>A good axiomatic system assumes as little as possible, while proving as much as possible. To create an efficient axiomatization for the natural numbers, we must distill these numbers to their essential properties. Intuitively, we understand various aspects of the natural numbers, such as their existence and the basic properties of the binary operations addition, multiplication, and the ‘less than’ relation. How few of these concepts can we take as axioms, from which we can deduce everything else that we need to know about the natural numbers? It turns out that remarkably little is required for the axiomatization of the natural numbers—neither addition, nor multiplication, nor the ‘less than’ relation need to be taken as axioms; these will all be constructed from our fundamental axioms.</p>



<p>The standard axiomatization of the natural numbers, know as the Peano Axioms, was originally formulated by the Italian mathematician, Giuseppe Peano. In <span data-katex-display="false">1889</span>, Peano developed the real number system based on his axioms for the natural numbers. He defined natural numbers through nine axioms, four of which established the properties of the equality relation “<span data-katex-display="false">=</span>” with regard to natural numbers, while the remaining five axioms provided a complete and rigorous definition of natural numbers.</p>



<p>In order to appreciate the intellectual feat of Peano, it’s worth noting that utilizing only his axioms, we are able to prove all the established properties of the natural numbers. Furthermore, these axioms facilitate the construction of the integer, rational, real, and complex number systems.</p>



<p>Before we discuss Peano’s Axioms in detail, it is a useful exercise to explore an alternative way to describe natural numbers, distinct from the usual intuitive notion of counting. Such an exploration would help us to independently arrive at Peano’s axioms.</p>



<h4>Intuition behind the Axiomatic Definition of Natural Numbers</h4>



<p>How do we model the concept of natural numbers denoted by <span data-katex-display="false">0, 1, 2, 3 </span> and so on without relying on the notion of counting?</p>



<p>One way would be to take a set-theoretic approach. That is, we can define a set of natural numbers by systematically enumerating the properties and relationships of the members of this set such that the set results in <span data-katex-display="false">\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}</span>.</p>



<p>Let us denote the set of natural numbers as <span data-katex-display="false">\mathcal{N}</span>. First, we recognize that <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> should be a part of this set. Next, we want <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> to lead us to <span data-katex-display="false">1</span>, <span data-katex-display="false">1</span> to <span data-katex-display="false">2</span> and we should be able to continue this way, naming each successive number as far as we wish. This is illustrated below.</p>



<div data-katex-display="true"><pre>0 \rightarrow1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow \ldots</pre></div>



<p>From the above diagram we can see that to model this relationship we need a “next” operation that given a natural number, produces the next natural number in the sequence. </p>



<p>The above diagram can also be viewed as shown below.</p>



<div data-katex-display="true"><pre>\begin{equation*} 
\begin{split}
0 &amp;\rightarrow 1 \\
1 &amp;\rightarrow 2 \\
2 &amp;\rightarrow 3 \\
\vdots &amp;\quad\,\,\,\, \vdots \\
\end{split}
\end{equation*} </pre></div>



<p>We can see from the diagram that an input of <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> yields an output of <span data-katex-display="false">1</span>, an input of <span data-katex-display="false">1</span> yields <span data-katex-display="false">2</span> and so on. Therefore, we can model the “next” operation as a <em><a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/set-theory-primer/#function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">function</a></em> <span data-katex-display="false">S : \mathcal{N} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}</span> that takes a natural number as input and produces a natural number as output. Here, the letter <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> stands for ‘successor’ and we have <span data-katex-display="false">S(0) = 1, S(1) = 2</span> and so forth. We will refer to this function <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> as the <em><strong>successor function</strong></em> since it establishes a succession within the set of natural numbers, <span data-katex-display="false">\mathcal{N}</span>. This function <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> is illustrated below.</p>

<p>From the diagram above, we can observe that the successor function <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> has the following properties:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Not Surjective:</strong> There is no natural number in <span data-katex-display="false">\mathcal{N}</span> that, when given as input to the successor function <span data-katex-display="false">S</span>, results in <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> as output. This implies that not every element of the codomain of <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> is the image of <em>at least</em> one element from its domain. Therefore, we can conclude that <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> is <em>not surjective</em> because <span data-katex-display="false">S(n) \neq 0 \text{ for any } n \in \mathcal{N}</span>.</li>



<li><strong>Injective:</strong> Different inputs to <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> yield different outputs. This means that every element of the codomain of <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> is the image of <em>at most</em> one element from its domain; that is, <span data-katex-display="false">S(m) = S(n) \text{ implies that } m = n \text{ for any } n, m \in \mathcal{N}</span>. Hence, <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> is <em>injective</em>. <br/></li>
</ol>



<p>From the diagram, we can also see that a natural number is either <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> or can be obtained from <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> by applying the successor function to <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> a finite number of times. This implies that <span data-katex-display="false">\mathcal{N}</span> is the minimal non-empty set that contains <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> and admits a successor function satisfying conditions <span data-katex-display="false">(1) \text{ and } (2)</span>.</p>



<p>Therefore, for the Peano Axioms to accurately describe the set of natural numbers, they must define a set that contains <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> and admits a successor function as described above.</p>



<h4>Original Formulation of Peano’s Axioms</h4>



<p>Before we discuss the modern version of Peano’s Axioms, it is interesting to know how these axioms were originally stated by Giuseppe Peano. While perusing Peano’s Axioms it is worth keeping in mind that during Peano’s time, the concept of set was still nascent; it was Peano who introduced the symbol <span data-katex-display="false">\in</span> in <span data-katex-display="false">1889</span> to denote “is an element of”. Being aware of Peano’s original formulation of these axioms helps us appreciate how far we have come in our mathematical journey and highlights that our journey towards better mathematical notation and abstraction still continues. 😃</p>



<p>The axioms stated below appear between the pages <span data-katex-display="false">387-408</span> in the book “Historia Mathematica <span data-katex-display="false">\mathit{1}</span>” published in the year <span data-katex-display="false">1974</span>.</p>



<p>In <span data-katex-display="false">1891</span>, two years after the publication of his axioms for the natural numbers, Giuseppe Peano published an article titled “Sul concetto di numero” which translates to “On the Concept of Number,” in a journal he founded that same year. In this article, he reduced his list of axioms to five by eliminating the four axioms related to the equality relation “<span data-katex-display="false">=\!\!&#34;</span>. </p>



<p>The following are the five Peano’s axioms stated in the article :</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="852" height="215" src="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Peano_Axioms.png" alt="" srcset="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Peano_Axioms.png 852w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Peano_Axioms-300x76.png 300w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Peano_Axioms-768x194.png 768w " sizes="(max-width: 852px) 100vw, 852px"/></figure>



<p>We can see how the archaic notation obfuscates these axioms.</p>



<p>These maybe interpreted as :</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1170" height="315" src="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screen-Shot-2024-11-26-at-1.02.47-AM.png" alt="" srcset="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screen-Shot-2024-11-26-at-1.02.47-AM.png 1170w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screen-Shot-2024-11-26-at-1.02.47-AM-300x81.png 300w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screen-Shot-2024-11-26-at-1.02.47-AM-768x207.png 768w " sizes="(max-width: 1170px) 100vw, 1170px"/></figure>



<p>In the Peano Axioms published in <span data-katex-display="false">1889 \text{ and } 1891</span>, the sequence of natural numbers began with <span data-katex-display="false">1</span>, and the set of natural numbers was denoted by <span data-katex-display="false">\mathit{N}</span>. However, in <span data-katex-display="false">1898</span> these axioms were modified so that the sequence began with <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> and the set was denoted by <span data-katex-display="false">\mathit{N_{\!0}}</span>.</p>



<p>The set of five Peano Axioms was increased to six in <span data-katex-display="false">1901</span> with the addition of the axiom – <span data-katex-display="false">\mathit{N_{\!0}} \in \text{Cls}</span>, i.e., the natural numbers form a class. With the addition of this last axiom, the axioms have received their final form, which are listed below.</p>

<h4>The Axiomatization of Natural Numbers</h4>



<p>We will first define the notion of equality as it pertains to natural numbers, and then we will formulate the Peano Axioms such that it provides an axiomatic definition of natural numbers.</p>



<p>Although Giuseppe Peano omitted the four axioms related to the equality relation from his later formulation of the axioms regarding natural numbers, we will still discuss these axioms for the sake of completeness. The likely reason for this omission is because the concept of <a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/equality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equality</a> extends beyond natural numbers to mathematical objects in general and pertains more to the realm of logic, which specifies the conditions under which two mathematical objects can be considered equal.</p>



<p>In our discussion of Peano’s Axioms, we will adopt some conventions from its final form. Therefore, we will start with <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> instead of <span data-katex-display="false">1</span> in our axiomatic system and denote the set of natural numbers by <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N_0}</span>, where the subscript <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> reminds us that <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> is included.</p>



<h5>The Notion of Equality</h5>



<p>Before we define the set of natural numbers <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N_0}</span> axiomatically, we will formalize the notion of equality through the four axioms of Peano, which establish the properties that the equality relation, denoted by <span data-katex-display="false">=</span>, must satisfy. </p>



<p>Suppose there exists a set <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N_0}</span> that satisfies Axioms <span data-katex-display="false">1</span> t0 <span data-katex-display="false">9</span> listed below.</p>



<p>Firstly, <em>every natural number should be equal to itself</em>; this is called the <em>reflexivity axiom</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbf{1}</span>. </strong>For every <span data-katex-display="false">x \in \mathbb{N_0}, x = x</span>.</p>



<p>Secondly, <em>if one natural number equals a second one, then the second one should equal the first one.</em> This is known as the <em>symmetry axiom</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbf{2}</span>. </strong>For every <span data-katex-display="false">x, y \in \mathbb{N_0}, \text{ if } x = y, \text{ then } y = x</span>.</p>



<p>Thirdly, <em>if one natural number is equal to a second, and that second natural number is equal to a third, then the first and third are equal to each other.</em> This is called the <em>transitivity axiom</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbf{3}</span>. </strong>For every <span data-katex-display="false">x, y, z \in \mathbb{N_0}, \text{ if } x = y \text{ and } y = z, \text{ then } x = z</span>.</p>



<p>These three properties of <em>reflexivity</em>, <em>symmetry</em> and <em>transitivity</em> are applicable to any two mathematical objects that are related by the <a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/equality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equality</a>. As we have already discussed during our study of Set Theory, equality is an <a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/set-theory-primer/#equality-relation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example</a> of an <em>equivalence relation</em>, which is a type of <a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/set-theory-primer/#binary-relation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">homogeneous binary relation</a> that satisfies the above three properties of reflexivity, symmetry and transitivity.</p>



<p>Since the equality relation is defined generically for all mathematical objects and not just for natural numbers, we must make explicit the assumption that if two mathematical objects are equal—i.e., they satisfy the equality relation—and one of them is a natural number, then the other must also be a natural number. The next axiom makes this assumption explicit, namely, a natural number can only be equal to another natural number.</p>



<p>Fourthly, <em>if any mathematical object is equal to a natural number, then that mathematical object is itself a natural number.</em> This is called the <em>closure of equality axiom</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbf{4}</span>. </strong>For all <span data-katex-display="false">x \text{ and } y, \text{ if } x \in \mathbb{N_0} \text{ and } x = y, \text{ then } y \in \mathbb{N_0}</span>.</p>



<p>That is, the set of natural numbers is <em>closed</em> under equality.</p>



<h5>The Peano Axioms</h5>



<p>We will now discuss the five main Peano axioms that define the natural numbers. Peano aimed to formulate these axioms such that the fewest possible axioms could generate all the natural numbers. Therefore, we will construct the Peano axioms by checking, after stating each axiom, whether the axioms stated thus far can unambiguously result in the set of natural numbers that we know of. That is, we will continue constructing the Peano axioms until these axioms, when taken together, incontrovertibly result in <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}</span>. </p>



<p>This method of constructing the Peano axioms leads to the insight that the entire set of natural numbers can be generated by asserting the existence of at least one natural number and then defining a function called the <em>successor function</em>. This function takes a natural number as input and outputs another natural number, resulting in the construction of all remaining natural numbers.</p>



<p>Let us now proceed with the construction of the Peano Axioms.</p>



<p>Since we start counting from <span data-katex-display="false">0</span>, it is unsurprising that <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> is the most obvious element to axiomatically include in the set of natural numbers.</p>



<p>Fifthly, <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> <em>is a natural number. </em></p>



<p><strong>Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbf{5}</span>. </strong><span data-katex-display="false">0 \in \mathbb{N_0}</span>.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1292" height="272" src="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_5-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_5-3.png 1292w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_5-3-300x63.png 300w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_5-3-768x162.png 768w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_5-3-1200x253.png 1200w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 1292px) 100vw, 1292px"/></figure></div>


<p>Thus far we are only guaranteed the existence of a single natural number, <span data-katex-display="false">0</span>. </p>



<p>From <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> we should be able to generate the other natural numbers; that is starting with <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> we should be able to reach <span data-katex-display="false">1</span>, from <span data-katex-display="false">1</span> reach <span data-katex-display="false">2</span> and so on, akin to counting. We can model this progression from one natural number to the next using a function that takes a natural number as input and produces another natural number as output. This function is called a <em>successor function</em> since it establishes a succession within the set of natural numbers and is written as <span data-katex-display="false">S : \mathbb{N_0} \rightarrow \mathbb{N_0}</span>. The next axiom simply states that there is a function <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> whose domain and codomain are the set of natural numbers, <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span>.</p>



<p>Sixthly, <em>every natural number has a successor which is also a natural number.</em></p>



<p id="axiom-6"><strong>Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbf{6}</span>.</strong> If <span data-katex-display="false">x \in \mathbb{N}_0</span>, then <span data-katex-display="false">S(x) \in \mathbb{N}_0</span>.</p>



<p>That is, the set of natural numbers, <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span>, is closed under the successor operation, <span data-katex-display="false">S</span>.</p>



<p>As this axiom implies, we will refer to <span data-katex-display="false">S(x)</span> as the <em>successor of</em> <span data-katex-display="false">\mathit{x}</span>.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1386" height="315" src="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_6-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_6-2.png 1386w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_6-2-300x68.png 300w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_6-2-768x175.png 768w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_6-2-1200x273.png 1200w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 1386px) 100vw, 1386px"/></figure></div>


<p>Till now we have only established that the set of natural numbers contains <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> and its successor, <span data-katex-display="false">S(0)</span>, where the function <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> takes natural numbers as input and outputs natural numbers. However, we are still quite far from having the set of natural numbers that we know of, since we could have <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0\}</span> and define <span data-katex-display="false">S(0) = 0</span>, which would still satisfy all of the above axioms. In this case, <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0\}</span>, but we want <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}</span>.</p>



<p>To achieve this, we need to ensure that the successor function <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> does not output <span data-katex-display="false">0</span>. Our next axiom will guarantee this by forbidding <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> from being the successor of any natural number, including itself.</p>



<p>Seventhly, <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> <em>is not  the successor of any natural number.</em></p>



<p><strong>Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbf{7}</span>.</strong> For every natural number <span data-katex-display="false">x \in \mathbb{N}_0, S(x) \neq 0</span>.</p>



<p>That means that there is no natural number whose successor is <span data-katex-display="false">0</span>. Consequently, the <em><a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/distinguishing-in-a-probabilistic-world-part-3/#preimage-element" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preimage</a></em> of <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> under <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> defined on the set of natural numbers is an empty set.</p>



<p>As a consequence of this axiom, we know that <span data-katex-display="false">S(0) \neq 0</span>. Therefore, <span data-katex-display="false">S(0)</span> must equal some other natural number, which we can denote by <span data-katex-display="false">1</span>. Hence, we can define <span data-katex-display="false">1</span> by <span data-katex-display="false">S(0) = 1</span>.</p>

<p>Based on axioms <span data-katex-display="false">5, 6 \text{ and } 7</span> we are guaranteed the existence of at least two natural numbers, <span data-katex-display="false">0 \text{ and } 1</span>, but not necessarily others.</p>



<p>For example, we could define <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0, 1\}</span>, where <span data-katex-display="false">S(0) = 1 \text{ and } S(1) = 1</span>. In this case, both natural numbers <span data-katex-display="false">0 \text{ and } 1</span> have the same successor, which is <span data-katex-display="false">1</span>.</p>



<p>If <span data-katex-display="false">S(0) = 1 \text{ and } S(1) = 1</span>, then the two natural numbers <span data-katex-display="false">0 \text{ and } 1</span> have the same successor, <span data-katex-display="false">1</span>. This set of natural numbers together with the successor function <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> defined on it would still satisfy all the above axioms. However, if we stop here, the axioms constructed thus far do not guarantee the existence of the rest of the natural numbers that we know of, namely, <span data-katex-display="false">2, 3, 4 \ldots</span>.</p>



<p>Therefore, our next axiom should ensure that different natural numbers have different successors. This means that every natural number is the successor of <em>at most</em> one natural number (since <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> is not the successor of any natural number) which implies that <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> must be an <em><a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/probability-primer/#injective-function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">injective function</a></em>. </p>



<p>Eighthly, <em>no two natural numbers have the same successor unless they are equal.</em></p>



<p id="axiom-8"><strong>Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbf{8}</span>.</strong> For all <span data-katex-display="false">x, y \in \mathbb{N}_0</span>, if <span data-katex-display="false">S(x) = S(y)</span>, then <span data-katex-display="false">x = y</span>.</p>



<p>This axiom leads to some important consequences. It excludes the possibility of defining <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> to be just <span data-katex-display="false">\{0, 1\}</span>. We already have <span data-katex-display="false">S(0) = 1</span> and since <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> is an injective function, we cannot have <span data-katex-display="false">S(1) = 1</span>. Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">7</span> excludes the possibility that <span data-katex-display="false">S(1) = 0</span>. Thus <span data-katex-display="false">S(1)</span> must be some other natural number, which we denote as <span data-katex-display="false">2</span>. Therefore, we can define <span data-katex-display="false">2 = S(1)</span>.</p>



<p>By a similar argument, <span data-katex-display="false">S(2)</span> cannot be <span data-katex-display="false">0, 1 \text{ or } 2</span>. Hence, it must be some other natural number, which we denote as <span data-katex-display="false">3</span>. Continuing this way, we see that <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> must contain all the natural numbers that we know of.</p>



<p>So far we have established that <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> must include <span data-katex-display="false">0</span>, its successor <span data-katex-display="false">1 = S(0)</span>, its successor’s successor <span data-katex-display="false">2 = S(1)</span> and so on. Thus <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> must include <span data-katex-display="false">0, S(0), S(S(0)), S(S(S(0))), \ldots</span>. In order to avoid so many nested applications of <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> we use the numerals <span data-katex-display="false">1, 2, 3</span> to denote <span data-katex-display="false">S(0), S(S(0)) \text{ and } S(S(S(0)))</span>, respectively.</p>



<p>These first eight axioms have resulted in the definition of <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> to include all the natural numbers that we know of. </p>



<p>Therefore, so far we only know that</p>



<div data-katex-display="true"><pre>\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\} \subset \mathbb{N}_0</pre></div>

<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1275" height="1024" src="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_8-2-1275x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_8-2-1275x1024.png 1275w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_8-2-300x241.png 300w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_8-2-768x617.png 768w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_8-2-1200x964.png 1200w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_8-2.png 1429w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 1275px) 100vw, 1275px"/></figure></div>


<p>At this point, it is interesting to ask whether our axiomatic definition of <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> precludes the inclusion of additional elements.</p>



<p id="positive-integers-superset">In order to answer this question, let us consider a version of <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> that satisfies all the above axioms but is not the usual set of natural numbers that we know of. That is,</p>



<div data-katex-display="true"><pre>\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\} \cup \{!, -\}</pre></div>



<p>As can be seen, this version of <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> contains all the natural numbers <em>and</em> also includes two other symbols, <span data-katex-display="false">! \text{ and } -</span>.</p>



<p>We will next define the successor function defined on this set. For the subset <span data-katex-display="false">\{0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\}</span> of <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span>, we define <span data-katex-display="false">S</span> as we have described above i.e., <span data-katex-display="false">S(0) = 1, S(1) = 2, S(2) = 3</span> and so on. For the subset <span data-katex-display="false">\{!, -\}</span> of <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span>, we define <span data-katex-display="false">S(!) = - \text{ and } S(-) = !</span>.</p>



<p>This version of <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> with this successor function satisfies all the axioms, but it has more elements than what we want our set of natural numbers to have. This is shown below.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1245" height="744" src="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_8_1.png" alt="" srcset="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_8_1.png 1245w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_8_1-300x179.png 300w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_8_1-768x459.png 768w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom_8_1-1200x717.png 1200w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 1245px) 100vw, 1245px"/></figure></div>


<p>Similarly, there could be other versions of <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> with different successor functions, each of which satisfies all of the above axioms from <span data-katex-display="false">5 \text{ through } 8</span> but could also have elements other than natural numbers. This is illustrated below.</p>


<div>
<figure id="axioms-one-to-eight"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1097" height="908" src="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom.drawio-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom.drawio-2.png 1097w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom.drawio-2-300x248.png 300w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom.drawio-2-768x636.png 768w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 1097px) 100vw, 1097px"/></figure></div>


<p>Based on axioms <span data-katex-display="false">5 \text{ to } 8</span>, the set <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> of natural numbers satisfies the following conditions:</p>



<ul>
<li><span data-katex-display="false">0 \in \mathbb{N}_0</span>; and</li>



<li>if <span data-katex-display="false">x \in \mathbb{N}_0,\text{then } S(x) \in \mathbb{N}_0</span>, where <span data-katex-display="false">S(x)</span> denotes the successor of <span data-katex-display="false">x</span>.</li>
</ul>



<p>This way of defining a set, where a <em>base clause </em>specifies the basic element of the set and an <em>inductive</em> <em>clause</em> details how to generate additional elements, is called an <em>inductive definition</em> of the set, and such a set is referred to as an <em>inductive</em> set.</p>



<p>Therefore, the axioms <span data-katex-display="false">5 \text{ to } 8</span> only ensure that <span data-katex-display="false">\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\} \subset \mathbb{N}_0</span>, where <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> is any set such that <span data-katex-display="false">0 \in \mathbb{N}_0</span> and if <span data-katex-display="false">x \in \mathbb{N}_0,\text{then } S(x) \in \mathbb{N}_0</span>.</p>



<p>However, as discussed earlier and shown in the diagram above, this definition of <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> does not exclude elements other than natural numbers from being contained in the set.</p>



<p>To ensure that only natural numbers are included in the set <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span>, i.e., <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}</span>, our next (and final) axiom should declare <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> to be the minimal set that satisfies axioms <span data-katex-display="false">5 \text{ through } 8</span>; specifically, <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> is the intersection of all sets that satisfy these axioms.</p>



<p>Since axiom <span data-katex-display="false">9</span> uses the inductive definition of a set in its construction, it is referred to as the <em>Axiom of Induction</em>. </p>



<p>We will now state our ninth and final axiom. 😇</p>



<p id="axiom-of-induction"><strong>Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbf{9}</span> (Axiom of Induction)</strong>. If <span data-katex-display="false">T \subset \mathbb{N}_0</span> is such that:</p>



<ul>
<li><span data-katex-display="false">0 \in T</span>; and</li>



<li><span data-katex-display="false">x \in T \implies S(x) \in T</span> for all <span data-katex-display="false">x \in \mathbb{N}_0</span>,</li>
</ul>



<p>then <span data-katex-display="false">T = \mathbb{N}_0</span>.</p>



<p>As we have already discussed, the axioms <span data-katex-display="false">5 \text{ through } 8</span> ensure that <span data-katex-display="false">\{0, 1, 2, \dots\} \subset \mathbb{N}_0</span>. Suppose <span data-katex-display="false">T = \{0, 1, 2, \dots\}</span>. We can see that <span data-katex-display="false">0 \in T \text{ and } x \in T \implies S(x) \in T \text{ for all } x \in \mathbb{N}_0</span>. Therefore, by Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">9</span>, <span data-katex-display="false">\{0, 1, 2, \dots\} = \mathbb{N}_0</span>.</p>


<div>

<p>Thus we finally have the set of natural numbers that we know of, namely, <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0, 1, 2, \dots\}</span>.</p>

<h5>Alternate Formulations of Axiom of Induction: Set-Based and  Predicate-Based Perspectives</h5>



<p>For the sake of completeness, we will discuss two alternate ways to formulate Peano’s Ninth Axiom, namely the <em>Axiom of Induction</em>.</p>



<p>The Axiom of Induction is a cornerstone of number theory, providing a powerful tool for proving statements about natural numbers. It can be expressed in two equivalent forms: set-based and predicate-based. Each form offers a different perspective on the same fundamental principle.</p>



<p><strong><em>Set-Based Axiom of Induction</em>:<em> Focusing on Subsets</em></strong></p>



<p><strong>Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbf{9}</span> (Axiom of Induction)</strong>. If <span data-katex-display="false">T \subset \mathbb{N}_0</span> is a set such that:</p>



<ul>
<li><span data-katex-display="false">0 \in T</span>; and</li>



<li><span data-katex-display="false">x \in T \implies S(x) \in T</span> for all <span data-katex-display="false">x \in \mathbb{N}_0</span>,</li>
</ul>



<p>then <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0 \subset T</span>.</p>



<p>In simpler terms, if a subset of natural numbers contains <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> and is closed under the successor operation (meaning that if a natural number is in the subset, its successor is also in the subset), then that subset must contain all natural numbers.</p>



<p>As discussed above, Axioms <span data-katex-display="false">5 \text{ through } 8</span> ensure that <span data-katex-display="false">\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\} \subset \mathbb{N}_0</span>. Additionally, we observe that the set <span data-katex-display="false">\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}</span> satisfies the following two conditions of Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">9</span>:</p>



<ul>
<li>It contains <span data-katex-display="false">0</span>; and</li>



<li>Whenever it contains an element <span data-katex-display="false">x</span>, it also contains its successor, namely, <span data-katex-display="false">S(x)</span>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Therefore, by Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">9</span>, it follows that <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0 \subset \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}</span>.</p>



<p>Since Axioms <span data-katex-display="false">5 \text{ through } 8</span> ensure that <span data-katex-display="false">\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\} \subset \mathbb{N}_0</span> and by Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">9</span> we have show that <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0 \subset \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}</span>, it follows that <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots\}</span>.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1070" height="709" src="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom.drawio-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom.drawio-3.png 1070w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom.drawio-3-300x199.png 300w , https://149722062.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Peano-Axiom.drawio-3-768x509.png 768w " sizes="auto, (max-width: 1070px) 100vw, 1070px"/></figure></div>


<p>This perspective emphasizes the structure of the subset itself. We are concerned with the elements that are members of the subset and how they relate to each other through the successor function.</p>



<p><strong><em>Predicate-Based Axiom of Induction</em>:</strong> <em><strong>Focusing on Properties</strong></em></p>



<p>Peano’s axioms five through eight collectively define a superset of natural numbers, specifically <span data-katex-display="false">\{0, 1, 2, \ldots\} \subset \mathbb{N}_0</span>. To ensure that this set <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> includes only natural numbers, Peano’s ninth axiom can also be formulated as the <em>principle of mathematical induction </em>over natural numbers. This formulation is equivalent to the <em>axiom of induction</em> and serves the same purpose of removing unwanted elements from the superset <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span>, ensuring that it contains only natural numbers.</p>



<p>The predicate-based form of the Axiom of Induction shifts the focus from subsets to <a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/set-theory-primer/#property" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">properties</a> (expressed as <a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/set-theory-primer/#predicate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predicates</a>) that natural numbers may or may not possess.</p>



<p>The reformulation of Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">9</span> in terms of predicates results in the <em>Principle of Mathematical Induction</em> which is stated as follows.</p>



<p id="principle-of-mathematical-induction"><strong>Axiom <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbf{9}</span> (Principle of Mathematical Induction).</strong> For any predicate <span data-katex-display="false">P(n)</span>, where <span data-katex-display="false">n</span> is a natural number, if:</p>



<ul>
<li><span data-katex-display="false">P(0)</span> is true, and</li>



<li>for every natural number <span data-katex-display="false">n</span>, <span data-katex-display="false">P(n)</span> being true implies that <span data-katex-display="false">P(S(n))</span> is also true,</li>
</ul>



<p>then <span data-katex-display="false">P(n)</span> is true for every natural number <span data-katex-display="false">n</span>.</p>



<p>Here, we are concerned with a property <span data-katex-display="false">(</span>represented by the predicate <span data-katex-display="false">P(n))</span> that natural numbers might possess. If <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> has the property, and if natural number <span data-katex-display="false">n</span> having the property implies that its successor <span data-katex-display="false">S(n)</span> also has the property, then all natural numbers must have the property.</p>



<p>This perspective emphasizes the properties of individual natural numbers. We are concerned with whether a given natural number has a specific property.</p>



<p><strong><em>Equivalence and Connection</em></strong></p>



<p>The set-based and predicate-based forms are logically equivalent, meaning they express the same fundamental principle. This equivalence is rooted in the relationship between subsets and predicates, as established by the <em><a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/set-theory-primer/#axiom-of-separation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axiom of Separation</a></em>.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>From Subset to Predicate:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Given <span data-katex-display="false">T \subset \mathbb{N}_0</span>, it implies from the Axiom of Separation that there exists a predicate <span data-katex-display="false">P(n)</span> such that <span data-katex-display="false">P(n)</span> is true if and only if <span data-katex-display="false">n \in T</span>.<br/></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li id="predicate-to-subset"><strong>From Predicate to Subset:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Given a predicate <span data-katex-display="false">P(n)</span> and a set <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span>, we can define a subset <span data-katex-display="false">T = \{n \in \mathbb{N}_0 \,|\, P(n) \text{ is true}\}</span>, by the <a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/set-theory-primer/#axiom-of-separation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Axiom of Separation</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Thus, the subset and predicate perspectives are simply two ways of expressing the same fundamental idea. The set-based form emphasizes the elements within a collection, while the predicate-based form emphasizes the properties of individual elements. The Axiom of Separation is the bridge that allows us to move seamlessly between these perspectives.</p>



<p><strong><em>Why Both Forms Are Useful</em></strong></p>



<p>Both forms of the Axiom of Induction are valuable tools in mathematical proofs. The set-based form is often used in set theory and related areas, while the predicate-based form is commonly used in number theory and other branches of mathematics where properties of numbers are the main focus.</p>



<p>Essentially, they are two sides of the same coin, and which one to use depends on the context of the problem and the preference of the mathematician.</p>



<h4>Method of Definition of Natural Numbers using Peano’s Axioms</h4>



<p>It should be noted that Peano’s Axioms only describe how to construct the set of natural numbers and do not define what natural numbers are intrinsically. A particular natural number is given when its generation under the inductive definition is given.</p>



<p>For example, the natural number <span data-katex-display="false">2</span> is defined as that <a href="https://principlesofcryptography.com/set-theory-primer/#mathematical-objects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mathematical object</a> which is obtained by starting with the initial object <span data-katex-display="false">0</span> and applying the successor function once and then again i.e., <span data-katex-display="false">2</span> represents <span data-katex-display="false">S(S(0))</span>.</p>



<h4>Existence of the Set of Natural Numbers satisfying Peano’s Axioms </h4>



<p>How do we establish the existence of a set, an element of that set, and a function from the set to itself, that satisfy Peano’s Axioms? These axioms themselves are insufficient to prove this existence. Consequently, there are two approaches to resolving this matter. </p>



<p>One common approach in mathematics is to take something as  axiomatic and then use it as the basis upon which we prove all our other results. Hence, such an approach requires us to be satisfied with taking the existence of a set satisfying Peano’s Axioms axiomatically. This axiom is called the <em>existence axiom for natural numbers</em> and guarantees that there exists a set with the properties that Peano’s axioms ascribe to it. </p>



<p>The statement of this axiom is as follows:</p>



<p><strong>Existence Axiom for Natural Numbers:</strong> There exists a set <span data-katex-display="false">\mathbb{N}_0</span> satisfying Axioms <span data-katex-display="false">1 \text{ through } 9</span>.</p>



<p>Alternatively, if we use the Zermelo-Fraenkel Axioms as our foundation for set theory, we can prove that something satisfying Peano’s Axioms exists, so we don’t need to assume it separately. We’ll show how this is done later.</p>



<h4>Proving Properties of Natural Numbers</h4>



<p>Having established the existence of the natural numbers and their fundamental properties as defined by Peano’s Axioms, we will next explore how to rigorously prove that the natural numbers satisfy any specific property using the <em>Axiom of Induction</em>.</p>
