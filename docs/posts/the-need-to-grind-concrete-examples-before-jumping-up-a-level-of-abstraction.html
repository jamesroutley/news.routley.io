You have to actually accumulate lots of life experiences.</p><p>And you might think you understand the quotes when you’re young, but after you accumulate more life experience, you realize that you really had only the most naive, surface-level understanding of the quotes back then, and you really had no idea what the hell you were talking about.</p><p>It’s the same way in math. In general, the purpose and power of an abstract idea is that it compresses a zoo of concrete examples. But if you haven’t built up that zoo of concrete examples then you miss out on that power.</p><p>If you shy away from grinding some messy math then you will never truly know what the hell you’re talking about.</p><center></center> <!-- keep original code below (not sure if it is used) --></section></div></div>
