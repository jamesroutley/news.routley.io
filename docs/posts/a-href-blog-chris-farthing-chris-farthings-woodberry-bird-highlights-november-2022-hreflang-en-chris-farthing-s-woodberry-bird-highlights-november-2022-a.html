    <div><p>November, like most months of winter, is usually a settled time for birds unless there is a period of severe weather. This year the month was fairly mild throughout, so we saw little movement other than the expected arrival of the last of our winter birds. </p></div>

  <div>
          <div><div><p>One exciting exception was a short-eared owl, which flew over with a group of carrion crows in hot pursuit on the 17th. The last record for this migrant was in 2018, curiously on exactly the same date!</p>
<p>A <strong>yellow-legged gull (above)</strong> which had been seen at the end of October as seen a couple of times at the start of November, visiting to have a wash and a bit of a loaf around as most gulls here do. An adult <strong>great black-backed gull</strong> was also seen on the 22<sup>nd</sup>.</p>
<p>The most interesting duck of the month was a male <strong>wigeon (below)</strong> seen on the 19<sup>th</sup>, with the highest count of <strong>shoveler</strong> being fifteen and<strong> teal</strong> being four.</p>
</div></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><p>Winter <strong>thrushes </strong>are generally a feature of November and we had <strong>redwings (below)</strong> either passing over or seen along the woodland trail most days. <strong>Fieldfare </strong>are less common, with the first of winter being seen on the 4<sup>th</sup> and only a low number of flyovers after that. Two<strong> jackdaws</strong> also passed over on the 24<sup>th</sup>.</p></div>
      </div>
  
  <div>
          <div><div><p>Two reliable visitors were <strong>kestrel </strong>and<strong> kingfisher</strong>, seen most days through the month. Much less reliable were <strong>snipe </strong>and <strong>water rail</strong>, seen only occasionally in November, probably due to the high water levels.</p>
<p>The total number of bird species seen here in November 2022 was 60, around the average for previous Novembers.</p>
