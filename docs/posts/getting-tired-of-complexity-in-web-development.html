    <h1>Ask HN: Getting tired of complexity in web development</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I have a few years of experience working mostly on the frontend with React and am getting more and more frustrated with all the added layers of complexity needed to work with most common frontend frameworks.</p><p>I’ve hit a point where it just doesn’t seem like the end justifies the means in the vast majority of cases anymore which really doesn’t make me excited to work on much in this space now.</p><p>The one redeeming quality of doing this kind of work is that it is in very high demand, and I worry that the price of becoming more specialized or doing something more enjoyable with less bloat is that it becomes much harder to find jobs.</p><p>Has anyone either switched from doing web development type work to something else they enjoy more for similar reasons? If anyone considers themselves very specialized in an area, do you worry about job opportunities?</p></div></div></div>
