However, these new processors are more prone to noise than conventional ones. If we want to make quantum computers more reliable, especially at scale, we need to accurately identify and correct these errors.</p><p data-block-key="fvfj6">In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08148-8">paper published today in Nature</a>, we introduce AlphaQubit, an AI-based decoder that identifies quantum computing errors with state-of-the-art accuracy. This collaborative work brought together Google DeepMind’s machine learning knowledge and Google Quantum AI’s error correction expertise to accelerate progress on building a reliable quantum computer.</p><p data-block-key="becp9">Accurately identifying errors is a critical step towards making quantum computers capable of performing long computations at scale, opening the doors to scientific breakthroughs and many new areas of discovery.</p></div>

The technology relies on qubits, or quantum bits, which can sift through vast sets of possibilities using quantum interference to find an answer.</p><p data-block-key="3pg5d">The natural quantum state of a qubit is fragile and can be disrupted by various factors: microscopic defects in hardware, heat, vibration, electromagnetic interference and even cosmic rays (which are everywhere).</p><p data-block-key="akva1">Quantum error correction offers a way forward by using redundancy: grouping multiple qubits into a single logical qubit, and regularly performing consistency checks on it.

Using the consistency checks as an input, its task is to correctly predict whether the logical qubit — when measured at the end of the experiment — has flipped from how it was prepared.</p><p data-block-key="fi530">We began by training our model to decode the data from a set of 49 qubits inside a <a href="https://research.google/blog/suppressing-quantum-errors-by-scaling-a-surface-code-logical-qubit/">Sycamore quantum processor</a>, the central computational unit of the quantum computer. To teach AlphaQubit the general decoding problem, we used a quantum simulator to generate hundreds of millions of examples across a variety of settings and error levels. Then we finetuned AlphaQubit for a specific decoding task by giving it thousands of experimental samples from a particular Sycamore processor.</p><p data-block-key="53vlb">When tested on new Sycamore data, AlphaQubit set a new standard for accuracy when compared with the previous leading decoders. In the largest Sycamore experiments, AlphaQubit makes 6% fewer errors than tensor network methods, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05434-1">which are highly accurate but impractically slow</a>.
