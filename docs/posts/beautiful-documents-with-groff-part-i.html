<p>I haven’t deliberately used a word processor since the late
eighties.</p>
<p>Of course, I’ve used Word here and there when I didn’t have a choice,
but not since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMate">MultiMate</a>—and before
that, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar">WordStar</a>—have
I intentionally sat down with full possession of my faculties and opened
up a word processor in order to write something I care about.</p>

</p>
<p>Okay, not quite. I went off to college in 1988 with a typewriter that
<em>sort of</em> had a screen and <em>sort of</em> behaved like a word
processor. I suppose today it would be regarded as a “distraction free”
writing device along the lines of the <a href="https://getfreewrite.com/products/freewrite-smart-typewriter-3rd-gen">very
chic and absurdly expensive stuff made by FreeWrite</a>, though since it
exceeded the clamor of an actual typewriter, it tended to distract
(i.e., wake up) everyone in the dorm. And I suppose there was a brief
period at the beginning of grad school when I was using some kind of
word processor on a very old—and I think, second hand—pre-OS-X Mac
laptop, though I can’t recall what that program might have been.</p>
<p>But the truth is that the minute I heard about Linux, I immediately
wanted to switch to that. I had been using commercial Unixes—AIX,
Solaris—at the various part-time (and later, full-time) jobs I had in
grad school and just loved it. At the time, however, Linux didn’t seem
to have a word processor (I’m sure it actually did). What did people use
to write documents? When I asked someone at the local Linux Users’ Group
about this, they told me about LaTeX. And that began a very long love
affair with typesetting in general and TeX in particular. I have used
some variation of TeX/LaTeX to write pretty much every paper, every
article, every talk, every letter, every slide, and every lecture I’ve
written for the last twenty-five years.</p>
<p>One of the pleasant side effects of this is that I can still read all
the stuff I’ve written since the mid-nineties. In fact, I can usually
still compile it into something that can be displayed or printed (DVI,
Postscript, or PDF). And honestly, after decades of using it, the “code”
rarely gets in the way. I’m so used to writing this way that I sometimes
start writing LaTeX when the format I’m supposed to be using is HTML or
Markdown. In fact, I find it really hard to work in a regular word
processor, not because of any actual aversion, but simply because I am
constantly hitting the key sequences for <a href="https://www.vim.org">Vim</a> in order to enter the styling
commands for LaTeX. And that’s another thing I’ve been doing forever:
writing <em>everything</em> in Vim.</p>
<p>But the real reason I stuck with it had more to do with a weird quirk
I have as a writer (that I suppose <em>started</em> when I was
introduced to TeX). In order to assess whether the thing I’m writing is
good or not, it’s important for me to see what it would look like as a
real book (or letter, or article, or whatever). It’s true that I love
typography, page design, and all related matters, but I suspect it’s
also a sort of psychological trick I’m playing on myself. If it
<em>looks</em> real, that makes it more likely that it will one day
<em>be</em> real. As in, <em>finished.</em> As in,
<em>published.</em></p>
<p>So the first paragraph or so of the book I just wrote looked like
this when I was composing it:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>\chapter</span>{Textual Behavior in the Human Male}<span>\label</span>{<span>textual behavior</span>}</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>\textsc</span>{My title,} of course, refers to the infamous Kinsey Report:</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>\emph</span>{Sexual Behavior in the Human Male,} first published in 1948.</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The Kinsey report is, like <span>\emph</span>{Harry Potter,} <span>\emph</span>{The Omnivore&#39;s</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>Dilemma,} and The Book of Job, one of those books you feel you&#39;ve read</span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>even if you haven&#39;t actually read it.  Its general outlines and</span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>conclusions, and the national sense of scandal that ensued, are well</span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>known even after sixty years.  When you do sit down to read it, though,</span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>the most shocking thing isn&#39;t its prurience or its candor, but its easy,</span>
<span id="cb1-12"><a href="#cb1-12" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>approachable tone.  It sounds like this:</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That’s what it looks like in Vim (more or less). But when I “compile”
the document, it looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://stephenramsay.net/images/latex-example.png" alt="The text above typeset in LaTeX with small caps, curly quotes, a large chapter initial, etc."/><br/>
</p>
<p>Now <em>that’s</em> starting to look like a book! <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Yes. Fussing with typography is an <em>excellent</em> way to
procrastinate, but then again, I have published a fair amount of stuff,
and … well, this is my “process,” you see. <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>There are a couple of problems with this process, though. One is that
no humanities publisher that I’ve ever worked with will accept
submissions in LaTeX. I wouldn’t expect them to do so. Publishers in
STEM fields often do because of LaTeX’s vaunted ability to produce
really nice looking mathematical formulas, but such publishers typically
provide very strict templates to their authors. In general, humanities
book publishers like to employ actual book designers to do actual book
designs, and those designers really prefer to start with as little
formatting as possible. This all makes complete sense to me, and even
though I’m a dab hand with TeX at this point, I would never confuse
myself with a professional designer.</p>
<p>So that’s one problem. When the book (or article, or whatever) is
done, I’m going to have to convert it to something else, and that
“something else” is <em>almost</em> always Microsoft Word. Again, I have
no substantive objections to this, but it’s kind of a pain. There are
converters that can get you most of the way there, but I’ve never found
a tool that can go from my lovingly formatted LaTeX to a publisher’s
lovingly insistent style guidelines without having to make a great many
interventions by hand.</p>
<p>The other problem only appears with long-form material, but it had
finally started to annoy me. LaTeX, you see, is slow. If you’re writing
the way I do, you’re essentially introducing a compile step (already an
intolerable thing for most writers, I suspect, and the whole reason for
word processors in the first place). But if the compile is taking, say,
a minute or more, it really starts to feel like it’s interrupting the
flow.</p>
<p>But what’s a writerly nerd to do? No word processor that I am aware
of produces documents as pretty as LaTeX; you’d have to use InDesign or
something like that. And what’s more, the price of all this beauty is a
really tedious conversion process at the very end.</p>
<p>I wasn’t looking around for a solution to these problems, really, but
I managed to stumble on one. Alas, the site that inspired me doesn’t
seem to exist anymore, but basically, it was a grad student who was
procrastinating as I do and had decided to write their thesis in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/"><code>groff</code></a>.</p>
<p>In <em>what now?</em> You mean that thing for creating UNIX man
pages? That’s the only thing I’d ever used it for, and that use case
seemed to have nothing at all to do with beautiful documents.</p>
<p>What I didn’t realize, however, is that roff is a bit like TeX, in
that it gives you a set of low-level primitives for creating
higher-level macros. The codes for writing man pages are one such set of
macros, but there are others. Including the rather elaborate <a href="https://www.schaffter.ca/mom/mom-01.html">“mom” macros.</a></p>
<p>The mom macros (I had never heard of them) are basically those macros
that are intended for creating beautiful long-form documents (in PDF or
Postscript) for display, with an emphasis on the sort of things fiction
writers and humanist scholars need to do. It even uses MLA form as its
default reference system! What does it look? Here’s a page from the book
I’m writing right now:</p>
<p><img src="https://stephenramsay.net/images/groff-mom-example.png" alt="Groff mom example with a big drop cap, small caps, curly quotes, and so"/><br/>
</p>
<p>Is that a <em>drop cap?</em> Why yes it is!</p>
<p>I think this looks lovely, and so far, mom hasn’t let me down. It’s
true that I don’t typically need to do anything terribly complex, but I
insist on having full control of all fonts (the above is in a Garamond I
quite like), and I absolutely must have: small caps, curly quotes; true
hyphens, en-, and em-dashes; dingbats, fleurons, and other common
ornaments; dot leaders (if I’m in the mood); text, hanging, and
lowercase figures; the ability to set the leading manually; a good
kerning algorithm; dynamic ligatures; true ellipses … well it’s rather a
long list, now that I think of it. Oh, and I also need lots of different
alphabets. Classical Hebrew, polytonic Greek, and Cyrillic fairly often,
as well as all the diacritics and letterforms of all the European
languages ancient and modern. Oh, and math. And mom does all of that. <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Using <code>groff</code> instead of TeX might seem like just a bit of
techno-hipsterism—like a preference for vinyl records or recumbant
bicycles. And really, since <code>groff</code> is a bit dorky even among
those already prone to dorkdom, it might be more like a preference for
wax cylinders and unicycles. What’s more, the <code>groff</code>
ecosystem (if that is even the right word) is <em>way</em> smaller than
TeX. I just installed <a href="https://tug.org/texlive/">TexLive</a> on
a pretty zippy Linux laptop, and it took over an hour. Mom is
surprisingly extensive (and extensible), but it hardly compares to the
hundreds (thousands?) of templates and packages available to TeX
users.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: It’s fast. Like really, really fast.</p>
<p>It did not, however, address my first problem, which is the
conversion from beautiful documents to unadorned Word. I’ll discuss my
glorious solution (read: my procrastinive peregrinations) to that
problem in Part II.</p>
