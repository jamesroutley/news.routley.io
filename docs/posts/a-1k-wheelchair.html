<p>Tanner Green is concerned about the tiny aluminum plugs left behind when you cut 30 holes in the seat rail of a wheelchair. The cutting is done by an enormous robotic laser controlled by a computer model. A tech feeds a 20-foot aluminum tube into the machine, makes a few clicks on the computer, and the machine gets to work, cutting the tube to length, 30 holes for the axle adjustment, two channels for clamping in the footplate tubes and two etchings to help line up the tube on the bending machine. Running at full speed, the cutting takes just a couple of minutes.</p>

<h2>Inside the Paradox</h2>



<p>When you turn into the neighborhood where Not a Wheelchair’s manufacturing facility is, you’re greeted by about a dozen cows chewing grass in a smallish, triangular field. There’s a busy road to one side and brand new, multistory apartment complexes on the other two sides. There’s no indication of how the cows got there — as if a city suddenly sprung up around them. Past the cows and the apartments are rows of warehouses. Then you turn the corner and the buildings go from huge to enormous. Not a Wheelchair is housed in one of the largest buildings I’ve ever seen.</p>



<p>The Not a Wheelchair name started to differentiate The Rig — an electric offroad vehicle capable of going places that a wheelchair could not. Nelson is famous for building and modifying all sorts of things — from converting a Humvee to electric power to digging an enormous bunker in the couple’s backyard, but Not a Wheelchair has quickly taken on an identity of its own. “We’ve always seen ourselves as an outdoor mobility company,” says Nelson. “We want to make it easier for people to move around outside and in their communities.” Now though, Nelson finds himself about to release a manual wheelchair under the Not a Wheelchair name. “We started calling it The Paradox Project,” he says. “But if you have a better idea for a name, we’re open to suggestions.”</p>

<h2>YouTube $</h2>



<p>If you’re looking at the reasons that Not a Wheelchair is able to make a $1,000 wheelchair, hyper-efficient manufacturing techniques and state-of-the-art equipment are near the top of the list. But factories and enormous fancy machines cost a lot of money, and in any normal business model, those costs are passed on to the consumer. But what if the owners aren’t dependent on — or even interested in — making money from the business? Meet Zack and Cambry, YouTube stars.</p>

<p>Cambry is slight and blond. She got hurt doing equestrian vaulting — basically gymnastics on horseback and yes, it’s as wild as it sounds. Zack and Cambry met via an online dating app and Cambry was upfront about her disability. “Before our first date, Zack asked me if there was anything he needed to do to pick me up,” Cambry says. “I really wanted to make up a big story about how he would have to go to DMV to get a special license to be able to take me anywhere, but I chickened out and told him, ‘You know, usually I just meet someone at a restaurant.’”</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="597" src="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelcha-handrims-1024x597.jpg" alt="man in warehouse holding a wooden rim with rims on display wall" srcset="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelcha-handrims-1024x597.jpg 1024w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelcha-handrims-300x175.jpg 300w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelcha-handrims-768x448.jpg 768w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelcha-handrims-50x29.jpg 50w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelcha-handrims-1200x700.jpg 1200w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelcha-handrims.jpg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/><figcaption>Not a Wheelchair is also developing more affordable wheelchair components like these wooden handrims.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While I’m rolling around the Not a Wheelchair facility, marveling at the scale of it, I can’t help but wonder why they decided to do it. I mean, it’s one thing to build cool, one-off mobility devices. It’s another thing entirely to self-fund and spend years developing the capacity to mass produce affordable wheelchairs. For Zack and Cambry, it was pretty simple: There is clearly a need. And with Zack’s background and connections, combined with the income from JerryRigEverything, they were in a unique position to do something about it.</p>



<h2>The Wheelchair Business</h2>



<p>Not a Wheelchair will sell its manual wheelchairs directly to consumers. That means if you want a wheelchair, you can go to the website, click through to an online configurator and spec out your wheelchair in real time. You enter your measurements, and a 3D model of your chair adjusts to your tweaks. You can see the difference that seat depths, backrest heights and frame angles make on the finished product.</p>



<p>Once the company opens to the public, Not a Wheelchair expects to have a custom, manual wheelchair shipped four weeks after you hit the order button. Ramped up to full speed, they hope to have that time down to two weeks. Compared to the typical wheelchair buying process, that is — to borrow a phrase from <em>Space Balls</em> — ludicrous speed. Not a Wheelchair aims to do it not only by automating as much of the process as possible, but also by eliminating the middlemen. That means no seating clinic, no insurance company, no DME supplier. This has pros and cons.</p>


<div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="748" height="924" src="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-829x1024.jpg" alt="man kneeling next to woman in wheelchair symbolically cutting through red tape over a wheelchair" srcset="https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape.jpg 748w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-243x300.jpg 243w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-768x948.jpg 749w, https://newmobility.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/notawheelchair-redtape-50x62.jpg 50w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"/><figcaption>One of the company’s goals is to cut through the red tape associated with buying a wheelchair.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Next up, insurance companies. They’re supposed to pay for your equipment. But they also require you to use other middlemen, which increases costs. In today’s broken system of U.S. healthcare, most insurance, even private, will pay a bare minimum for manual wheelchairs and components. Copays for that basic equipment often cost more than $1,000. For wheelchair users with specific needs (most of us) who go through the runaround of denials, only to be “approved” and still owe four figures, it can feel like a shell game.</p>



<p>“The whole point of my YouTube channel is durability and repairability. I’ve been preaching that for 12 years, so we’re bringing that into the chair as well. We’re using standard hardware, and we’re consolidating as many of the bolts as possible to as few sizes as possible so that there are fewer tools needed. We want to be able to make it simple enough that people can do the adjustments and the repairs by themselves, and if they need a caster replaced, something binds up or the bearing inside the caster seizes, they can pop the caster off and put a new one on and we’ll sell those replacement parts. Or, if they’re under warranty, we’ll just give them those replacement parts.”</p>



<h2>Testing, Testing</h2>



<p>So how does Not a Wheelchair’s base model chair stack up to other options on the market? I hate to sound like a preacher, but … it’s totally reasonable! It hits the mark of being at least as good, if not better, than the majority of insurance-approved wheelchairs in the U.S.</p>

<p>The wheels, which Not a Wheelchair commissioned from <a href="https://vaporwheels.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vapors Wheels</a>, are great. I liked them so much that I stole them to replace the $900, fiber-spoked wheels that keep going out of true on my titanium chair. I put the old wheels with some fatter tires on the Not a Wheelchair and lowered the rear seat height so I could use it as an off-road chair for pushing around the dirt and grass around my house. I’ll keep pushing <a href="https://newmobility.com/finding-the-right-wheelchair/" data-type="post" data-id="44071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my titanium chair </a>for everyday life because I like how titanium rides, and my chair is fitted with ergo seating and other frame customizations that Not a Wheelchair isn’t yet offering.</p>
