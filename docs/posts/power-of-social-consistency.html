    <h1>Power of social consistency!</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>This year, I took upon a challenge to write 100 blog posts. I was only motivated till I reached the 5th blog post. After which I derailed and stopped posting.</p>
<p>It was always on my to-do list, and I would look at my list every morning. So it is not something I’d forgotten about. I could say I was busy doing other things, but that’s not the case either. For the lack of better terms, I just got complacent. I would procrastinate writing a post until that became my new reality.</p>
<p>Today, I got an unsuspecting message from a good friend.</p>
<p><img height="500" src="https://nayak.io/social/toms_message.jpg" alt="Toms message"/>
</p>
<p>This was super powerful. His message had an immediate impact on me. It made me realize that there was someone keeping track of me, someone who was close to me.</p>
<p>Social consistency is a powerful concept. Failure to meet our expectations leads to disappointment, but we are equipped to deal with this. But failing from someone else’s perspective is something most of us cannot tolerate. We generally go to great lengths to ensure we match the expectation that society has of us.</p>
<p>Somehow I think this is not utilized as much as it could be. I had been thinking about this for a while now, and Tom’s message was the final nail in the coffin.</p>
<p>I plan to play around with this idea and build a to-do app (yes, yet another to-do app on the internet), where the drive is social consistency. Early thoughts on this include a medium via which you list your goals granularly with trackable metrics. But updating the progress is offloaded to your friends/family. This allows you to set up a social circle which keeps you accountable.</p>
<p>I plan to build this out at <code>didifinish.com</code> and blog about it here. If you have any thoughts about this, I’d be happy to chat!</p>
