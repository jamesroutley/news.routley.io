    <h1>X is closing San Francisco HQ and relocating staffers to San Jose</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content"><div><div data-cy="article-content"><p>X, the social media company formerly known as <a href="https://fortune.com/company/twitter/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/twitter/">Twitter</a>, is set to leave San Francisco in the coming weeks.</p><div>



<p>In a Monday email from Linda Yaccarino, the<a href="https://fortune.com/2023/11/20/inside-elon-musk-twitter-44-billion-takeover-x-oral-history/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/11/20/inside-elon-musk-twitter-44-billion-takeover-x-oral-history/"> CEO of X appointed last year by owner Elon Musk</a>, X staffers were briefly informed of the company’s plans to shutter the office that has served as Twitter headquarters for more than a decade.</p>



<p>“After much thought, we have made the decision to close our San Francisco office over the next few weeks,” Yaccarino wrote in the email viewed by <em>Fortune</em>. “This is an important decision that impacts many of you, but it is the right one for our company in the long term.”</p>



<p>Musk abruptly <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813295489032622586?lang=en" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813295489032622586?lang=en" rel="noopener">stated on X</a> about three weeks ago that the company’s headquarters would move to Texas, where his other companies <a href="https://fortune.com/company/spacex/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/spacex/">SpaceX</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/company/tesla/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/company/tesla/">Tesla</a> and The Boring Company, are also located. Musk and X were sued earlier this year by the owner of the Market Street building, for allegedly failing to pay rent after Musk took over Twitter in late 2022. The building owner <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/xs-san-francisco-landlord-dismisses-lawsuit-claiming-unpaid-rent-2024-03-19/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/xs-san-francisco-landlord-dismisses-lawsuit-claiming-unpaid-rent-2024-03-19/" rel="noopener">dismissed</a> the lawsuit in March.  </p>



<p>Yaccarino’s note to X staff said nothing of a move to Texas, as Musk claimed last month. Instead, she said that X staff located in San Francisco would be moved to existing office space in San Jose and Palo Alto. </p>



<p>“We will work to transition to our new primary locations in the Bay Area,” she wrote.</p>



<p>The move comes as San Francisco is struggling to revive its downtown district and its commercial real estate market. And it marks a setback to the city’s efforts to turn the gritty mid-Market Street area into a thriving tech hub. </p>

Soon after Musk became Twitter’s owner, firing thousands of employees, several floors of the building were effectively closed; and when the company was renamed X, the famous <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/07/26/passionate-elon-musk-employees-are-coating-the-twitter-offices-in-black-paint-and-boasting-about-hunting-and-eradicating-remnants-of-the-twitter-bird/" target="_self" aria-label="Go to https://fortune.com/2023/07/26/passionate-elon-musk-employees-are-coating-the-twitter-offices-in-black-paint-and-boasting-about-hunting-and-eradicating-remnants-of-the-twitter-bird/">Twitter sign (along with all other vestiges of the company’s pre-Musk era) were summarily removed</a>. More than a dozen <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs-closing-international-offices-singapore-europe-2023-1#:~:text=Twitter%20is%20leaving%20at%20least,Twitter&#39;s%20new%20owner%2C%20Elon%20Musk." target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs-closing-international-offices-singapore-europe-2023-1#:~:text=Twitter%20is%20leaving%20at%20least,Twitter&#39;s%20new%20owner%2C%20Elon%20Musk." rel="noopener">global offices were closed as well.</a> Musk also ended the company’s flexible work from home policy, requiring all employees to work in the office every day. </p>



<p>X representatives did not respond to an email seeking comment. Details of Yaccarino’s email was first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/x-twitter-san-francisco-office.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/technology/x-twitter-san-francisco-office.html" rel="noopener">reported by the New York Times</a>. </p>
