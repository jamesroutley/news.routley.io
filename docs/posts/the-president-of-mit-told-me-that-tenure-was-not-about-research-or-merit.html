Want to read an insane tenure denial story? I was denied tenure at MIT in 2018. I was the only Hispanic faculty at my department, had 13k+ citations, 2 books, &amp; papers in Nature, Science, &amp; PNAS. I was never given a reason &amp; the only letter I got told me to check the website./1üßµ <span><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FL0RawXXEAEaCQC.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="Image" src="https://threadreaderapp.com/images/1px.png" data-src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FL0RawXXEAEaCQC.jpg"/></a></span>
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
After the denial I asked to meet my department head. He did not provide any reason other than ‚Äúthe decision came from above‚Äù &amp; that there was nothing him or the department could do. So a few months later I asked to meet with him again &amp; requested a meeting with the president.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
He backpedaled &amp; told me that it was not ‚Äúreally above,‚Äù but a decision from the school. He then dissuaded me to meet the president, although I did manage to meet him later. But since the school theory didn‚Äôt make sense either, I asked for another meeting a few months later.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
I was trying to understand. To get a reason other than check the website. Eventually the president would tell me a real reason, but what I could put together up until that time was that the department was divided about me &amp; presented a weak case so the school could shoot it down.

I understood I was not going to get a straight answer from my department head, so I wrote an appeal case and asked for a meeting with the president. If I was going to appeal, I wanted to do it in good terms. </p></div>
<p>
I remember entering his office &amp; seeing the view of the Charles river. The president knew who I was (because of my research) and asked me why I was there. He told me he had never heard about my tenure case since it had never reached him.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
We had our conversation in Spanish, and I think that afforded some candor that would not have been there otherwise. I presented him my appeal papers &amp; asked him about appealing, because I wanted it to do it amicably.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
He told me he didn‚Äôt want to touch the case unless it was an official submission, but that he could provide me with some advice. So I asked him if he had any advice about my situation. He said:
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
‚ÄúLook Cesar, the truth is that, if you are a mediocre researcher, but your department wants to keep you, they‚Äôll find a way to keep you. And if you are a strong researcher, and your department wants to get rid of you, they‚Äôll find a way to get rid of you.‚Äù
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
I finally got ‚Äúan answer.‚Äù The president of MIT told me that tenure was not about research, productivity, or merit. It was about office politics &amp; being liked by your department. He didn‚Äôt mean it in a bad way. I think he was being kind &amp; honest. So I ask him if I should appeal.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
His next answer was more strategic. He told me that of course he could not advice me not to appeal, but that I should consider the following:
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
Other universities might be considering me, and would probably call my department head asking for a recommendation. The only thing my dept. head had to do to kill my chances was to reply that he was to busy to provide a recommendation. So I should be careful to not upset him.

<p>
In hindsight it was obvious. But one of the reasons why I choose academia is because I believed in the power of ideas &amp; hardwork.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
I remember the day of my tenure denial. I had to host a professor who was near retirement. I was scheduled to meet him at 3pm but was informed about my denial at noon. So I had to suck it up and welcome him in my office. But I couldn‚Äôt act like nothing happened, so I told him:

‚ÄúI am sorry, I am not going to be able to simply talk about research. I just learned that my tenure case was denied.‚Äù</p></div>
<p>
My mistake was thinking I was a player when I was a pawn.
<sup><i></i></sup>
</p>
<p>
*I have more to tell. I could probably fill a book with the psychological damage I experienced at ‚Äúthe institute.‚Äù But as you may understand these are difficult things to talk about. They are the storm that lives within me &amp; wakes me up at night. It took me years to share this.
