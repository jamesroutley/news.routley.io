<li>hello, heya, hi and hey!</li>
<li>been listening to mal blum&#39;s newest single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3FoVkE77IY"><em>i&#39;m so bored</em></a> on repeat.</li>
<li>still struggling with process stuff around my long form writing. i had a quote on an old vision board from maya angelou, ‚Äúi make writing as much a part of my life as I do eating or listening to music‚Äù. i misremembered this just now, and thought it was about <em>enjoying</em> writing as much as eating or listening to music, which is a such a good slip up it must say something about me. not sure what right this second, but something.</li>
<li>on process, i am reading a <a href="https://markcarrigan.net/2024/04/30/how-to-enjoy-writing/">series of blog posts</a> on how to enjoy writing more, and i think so far (only like 3 posts in) I have found that I&#39;m often dragging myself to look at a blank page and eke out words, out of obligation and crappy prioritisation. i could always productively procrastinate and write on a topic i do actually have ideas for at any time. wild i know! on some level i feel like you should concentrate on one thing at a time, even though historically i never have. time to lean into having many balls in the air, i think! this shift might alleviate most of the issues i have with the actual &#34;producing words&#34; part, but we&#39;ll see if i end up ever actually finishing anything. hopefully he has more tips for that later on.</li>
<li>the vibes have been so off this week. a lot is happening, most of it bad, in the news cycle and wider world. i don&#39;t have much to add to this other than maybe donate to some mutual aid fundraisers and be nicer than normal to people. everyone i&#39;ve spoken to about the bad vibe is feeling it too!</li>
<li>i am still slowly writing about social media for a video. i am increasingly feeling weird about being on Zuckerberg&#39;s internet,¬†by which i mean instagram. i know whatsapp is in his tentacles too, but i am but one boy asking the queers to move stuff to: where exactly? i don&#39;t currently have answers or polished products to get people to jump to, but perhaps i will after i finish writing this thing? stay tuned!</li>
<li>i have such a slow typing speed i have discovered - about 60wpm if i type naturally aka not how you&#39;re supposed to - but even that slow it &#34;only&#34; takes around 90 minutes of concentrated no-take-backsies writing to write 5k words. i&#39;m trying to think if i&#39;ve ever written 5k or more in a day in my life, maybe not even at uni?? but I realise i&#39;m not counting all the stuff i have sent people in instant messages, lol, so maybe i have.</li>
<li>read orwell&#39;s &#34;why i write&#34; and i was really struck by his four categories of motivation: ego, aesthetic, politics and (preserving) history. he says most people are motivated by more than one, and defines politics as any attempt to change people&#39;s minds on something. i liked the book overall less than i expected (and rushed through one essay) due to not as much of it being about why he wrote as you&#39;d expect, but i recommend it overall!</li>
<li>you can tell i&#39;m enjoying writing more cos i won&#39;t fucking shut up about it!</li>
<li>enjoying really leaning into my proclivities. is this what autistic unmasking is supposed to feel like? is this joy?? i just/only need people on blogs/discord/text/face to face (i guess) to tell me that my way of being is fine, actually. i feel so much more able to do whatever i want! the case i&#39;m thinking about is mostly reading non-fiction (and on tech and social justice stuff) and feeling fine about it for once! beats worrying i should be reading the next great literary novel. i might read it, i might not, it will be a surprise to us all!</li>
<li>sorry if there are loads of gigantic run-on sentences in this. i am trying to break it up a little before posting, but as long time readers have probably guessed, i&#39;m reading these five times tops and i definitely miss stuff lol. i hope you can forgive me.</li>
<li>been eating copious amounts of ice cream, tortilla chips and guacamole, dal and rice, and pistachio cream chocolate.</li>
<li>how are you? are you feeling the bad vibes? are you having an amazing time despite it all?</li>
<li>see you next week üíü</li>
