<p>The hardest part of becoming a writer, for me, was telling people.</p>

<p>I had no problem saying I was a software engineer. That was something concrete, and understandable, and which invited no particular further enquiry. It was safe. But to say you’re an artist of any kind takes a special kind of courage.</p>

<p>When I did start telling people — not just that I was writing, but that I was a <em>writer</em> — things changed. I felt a sense of relief, right along with the vulnerability and the doubt. It was like telling a secret, or perhaps confessing a transgression.</p>

<p>I suppose that art <em>is</em> a transgression, isn’t it? Because people don’t get to do that; to be artists. It’s a thing for children, or the pathologically detached and eccentric. Regular people, by definition, aren’t artists — or so we tell ourselves. So, yes, laying claim to art is transgressive. And like so many such acts, it’s also liberating.</p>

<p>Creativity is innate, but the application of creativity requires giving yourself permission. Correspondingly, becoming an artist is a simple choice you can make at any time, but <em>identifying</em> as one requires the knowledge of others. The anxiety we feel comes from our projection of the thoughts of others, after all. Safe within our private minds, we already know.</p>

<p>If you’re struggling with the fact (the <em>fact</em>) that you’re an artist, let me give you a piece of advice which I had to learn the hard way, because I don’t want you to have to wait, and to doubt, and to struggle with it.</p>

<p>Tell people.</p>
