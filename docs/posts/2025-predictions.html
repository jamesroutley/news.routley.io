Back in the early 2000s, juicing your ranking on search engines was pretty easy - you could put a bunch of junk in your <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/meta-description">meta description tags</a> or put some text with lots of keywords on each page and make that text really tiny and transparent so users didn’t notice it but Google did.</p><p>I doubt that <a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/">Perplexity’s userbase is <em>that</em> big</a> but Perplexity users are probably a lot wealthier on average than Google’s, and there’s some edge to be achieved by getting Perplexity to rank your content highly or recommend your website. I’ve already noticed some search results including links to content farms.</p><p>There are handful of startups that do this already, but the prediction is: the average marketing exec at a consumer brand will put some of their budget to work on <em>fooling AI</em>. That means serving different content to AI scrapers, maybe using some twist on <a href="https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/">Glaze</a> and other forms of adversarial image processing to make their marketing images more tantalizing to the bots. Websites will be increasingly aware that they’re being consumed by AI, and they will have a vested interest in messing with the way AI ‘perceives’ them.</p><p>As Simon notes in his predictions, AIs are gullible: and that’s <em>before</em> there are widespread efforts to fool them. There’s probably some way to detect an AI scraper, give it a special payload, and trick it into recommending your brand of razors whenever anyone asks, and once someone figures it out this will be the marketing trend of the decade.</p><p>The latest lawsuit about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/10/mark-zuckerberg-meta-books-ai-models-sarah-silverman">Meta’s use of pirated books</a>, allegedly with Mark Zuckerberg’s explicit permission, if true, will be another reason to lose faith in the American legal system’s intellectual property system entirely. We’ve only seen it used to punish individuals and protect corporations, regardless of the facts and damages, and there’s no reason to believe it will do anything different (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does">POSIWID</a>).</p><p>The result, besides an uptick in nihilism, could be a rejuvenation of physical-only releases. New albums only released on vinyl. Books only available in paperback format. More private screenings of hip movies. When all digital records are part of the ‘training dataset,’ a niche, hipster subset will be drawn to things that aren’t as easily captured and reproduced.</p><p>This is parallel, to the state of closed-source models from Anthropic or OpenAI. They’re never distributed or run locally. They exist as bytes on some hard drive and in some massive GPU’s memory in some datacenter, and there aren’t Bittorrents pirating them because they’re kept away from people, not because of the power of copyright law. What can be accessed can be copied, so secrecy and inaccessibility is valuable.</p><h2 id="3-american-tech-companies-will-pull-out-of-europe-because-they-want-to-do-acquisitions">3: American tech companies will pull out of Europe because they want to do acquisitions</h2><p>The incoming political administration will probably bring an end to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lina_Khan">Lina Khan</a>’s era of the FTC, and era in which the FTC <em>did stuff</em>. We will go back to a ‘hands off’ policy in which big companies will acquire each other pretty often without much government interference.</p><p>But, even in Khan’s era, the real nail in the coffin for one of the biggest acquisitions - Adobe’s attempt to buy Figma – was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/20/24008189/adobe-figma-deal-eu-explained-decoder">regulators from the EU and UK</a>. Those regulators will probably keep doing stuff, so I think it’s likely that the next time some company wants to acquire a close competitor, they just close up shop in the EU, maybe with a long-term plan to return.</p><h2 id="4-the-tech-industrys-dei-backlash-will-run-up-against-reality">4: The tech industry’s ‘DEI backlash’ will run up against reality</h2><p>The reality is that the gap between <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/11/18/us-women-are-outpacing-men-in-college-completion-including-in-every-major-racial-and-ethnic-group/">women and men in terms of college degrees</a> is really big: “Today, 47% of U.S. women ages 25 to 34 have a bachelor’s degree, compared with 37% of men.” And that a great deal of the tech industry’s workforce is made of up highly-skilled people who are on H-1B visas.</p><p>The synthesis will be that tech workers <em>will</em> be more diverse, in some respects, but by stripping away the bare-bones protections around their presence, companies will keep them in a more vulnerable and exploitable position. But hard right-wingers will have plenty to complain about because these companies will continue to look less white and male, because the labor pool is not that.</p><h2 id="5-local-first-will-have-a-breakthrough-moment">5: Local-first will have a breakthrough moment</h2><p>I think that <a href="https://zero.rocicorp.dev/">Zero Sync</a> has a good chance at cracking this really hard problem. So does <a href="https://electric-sql.com/">electric</a> and maybe <a href="https://jazz.tools/">jazz</a>, too. The gap between the dream of local-first apps and the reality has been wide, but I think projects are starting to come to grips with a few hard truths:</p><ol><li>Full decentralization is <em>not worth it</em>.</li><li>You need to design for syncing a <em>subset of the data</em>, not the entire dataset.</li><li>You <em>need an approach to schema evolution and permission checking</em></li></ol><p>These systems are getting there. We could see a big, Figma-level application built on Zero this year that will set the standard for future web application architecture.</p><h2 id="6-local-small-ai-models-will-be-a-big-deal">6: Local, small AI models will be a big deal</h2><p>Embedding models are cool as heck. New text-to-speech and speech-to-text models are dramatically better than what came before. Image segmentation is getting a lot better.</p><p>There’s a lot of stuff that is coming out of this boom that will be able to scale down to a small model that runs on a phone, browser, or at least on our own web servers without having to call out to OpenAI or Anthropic APIs. It’ll make sense for costs, performance, and security. <a href="https://github.com/huggingface/candle">Candle</a> is a really interesting effort in this area.</p><h2 id="mini-predictions">Mini predictions</h2><ul><li><strong>Substack will re-bundle news</strong>. People are tired of subscribing to individual newsletters. Substack will introduce some ~$20/month plan that gives you access to all of the newsletters that participate in this new pricing model.</li><li><strong>TypeScript gets a <a href="https://github.com/fxn/zeitwerk">zeitwork</a> equivalent and lots of people use it</strong>. Same as how <code>prettier</code> brought full code formatting from TypeScript, autoloading is the kind of thing that <em>once you have it, it’s magic</em>. What if you could just write <code>&lt;SomeComponent /&gt;</code> in your React app and didn’t have to import it? I think this would be extremely addictive and catch on fast.</li><li><strong>Node.js will fend off its competitors</strong>. Even though <a href="https://www.val.town/">Val Town</a> is built around Deno’s magic, I’ve been very impressed that Node.js is keeping up. They’ve introduced <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/permissions.html">permissions</a>, just like Deno, and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/run-natively">native TypeScript support</a>, just like the upstarts. Bun and Deno will keep gaining adherents, but Node.js has a long future ahead of it.</li><li><strong>Another US city starts seriously considering congestion pricing.</strong> For all the chatter and terrible discourse around the plan, it is obviously a good idea and it will work, as it has in every other case, and inspire other cities to do the same.</li><li><strong>Stripe will IPO.</strong> They’re still killing it, but they’re killing it in an established, repeatable way that public markets will like, and will let up the pressure on the many, many people who own their stock.</li></ul></div></div>
