                <p>Welcome to the LEGO Island web port project! This is a recreation of the classic 1997 PC game, rebuilt to run in modern web browsers using Emscripten.</p>
                <p>This incredible project stands on the shoulders of giants. It was made possible by the original <a href="https://github.com/isledecomp/isle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">decompilation project</a>, which was then adapted into a <a href="https://github.com/isledecomp/isle-portable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portable version</a>. This represents a year-long effort, involving thousands of hours of work from many awesome contributors dedicated to preserving this piece of gaming history.</p>
                <p>Our goal is to make this classic accessible to everyone. The project is still in development, so you may encounter bugs. Your patience and feedback are greatly appreciated!</p>
