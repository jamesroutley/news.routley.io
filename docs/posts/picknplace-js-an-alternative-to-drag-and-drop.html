    <h1>Show HN: Picknplace.js, an alternative to drag-and-drop</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Why?</p>
          <p>
            I find that the drag and drop experience can quickly become a
            nightmare, especially on mobile.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trying to tap, hold, drag, and scroll, all at the same time, is
            awkward, slow, and error-prone.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&#39;ve long had in mind a simpler 2-step approach: picking an item
            first, then placing it.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I implemented this basic version to showcase my idea.
          </p>
        </div><div>
          <p>How does this work?</p>
          <p>
            When picking an item, a duplicate of the list is created on top of
            the original one.
          </p>
          <p>
            The duplicate is interactive and animated, and will update based on
            the scroll position.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end, the user can either confirm or cancel the changes.
          </p>
        </div></div>
