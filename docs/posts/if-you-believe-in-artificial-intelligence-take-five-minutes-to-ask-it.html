		<p>Here’s <a href="https://sauropods.win/@mike/111935967471427403">a Mastodon thread from a year ago</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just a quick check on how ChatGPT’s getting on …</p>
<p><strong>Me</strong>: Who reassigned the species <em>Brachiosaurus brancai</em> to its own genus, and when?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> The species <em>Brachiosaurus brancai</em> was reassigned to its own genus, <em>Giraffatitan</em>, by the paleontologist Michael Janensch in 1914.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Dude, that is so wrong I can’t even.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT</strong>: I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The reassignment of <em>Brachiosaurus brancai</em> to <em>Giraffatitan brancai</em> was not done by Michael Janensch. The correct attribution goes to the paleontologist Ernst Stromer, who reclassified it in 1914.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> That answer is even worse. Stromer had nothing to do with the genus name <em>or</em> species name.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. The reassignment of <em>Brachiosaurus brancai</em> to <em>Giraffatitan brancai</em> was actually done by the paleontologist Werner Janensch, not Michael Janensch, in 1914.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>sigh</em></p>
<p>Regular readers will know that the actual sequence of events was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Riggs (1903) named the genus <em>Brachiosaurus</em> and its type species <em>Brachiosaurus altithorax</em>.</li>
<li>Janensch (1914) named a second species of this genus, “<em>Brachiosaurus”</em> <em>brancai</em>.</li>
<li>Paul (1988) considered the two species separate at the subgeneric level (a taxonomic level that is rarely if ever used in vertebrate palaeontology) and named the subgenus <em>Brachiosaurus</em> (<em>Giraffatitan</em>) <em>brancai</em>.</li>
<li>Olshevsky (1991) used the genus-and-species combination <em>Giraffatitan brancai</em> without comment in a self-published booklet, a combinaton which was not followed by any formal publication known to me, until …</li>
<li>Taylor (2009) demonstrated that numerous characters separate the two species and that <em>Giraffatitan</em> is a separate genus with type species <em>G</em>. <em>brancai</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, ChatGPT got <em>every single part of that</em> wrong. It left Riggs, Paul, Olshevsky and me out completely. It credited Werner Janensch for reassigning a species to a genus whose name was coined 19 years after he died. It pulled poor Ernst Stromer in for some reason. It invented “the paleontologist Michael Janensch”, who is presumably the unholy offspring of Werner Janensch and me. And in all three answers, it insisted that the reassignment was done in 1914, 74 years before the name <em>Giraffatitan</em> was coined.</p>
<p>But the worst part of this is not the errors. It’s not the blithe confidence with which the false facts are recited. It’s not even the bland “I apologize for the mistake in my previous response” to be followed by more utter nonsense. It’s that <em>these incorrect answers look so plausible</em>. For a lay-person — someone who, foolishly, has not been reading this blog for the last eighteen years — the answers given here look superficially reasonable. A kid doing a homework report on <em>Brachiosaurus</em> could take these answers and weave them into the submission without even having an inkling that they’re completely wrong. And the teacher who has to mark the essay will also likely swallow them.</p>
<p>Because LLMs get catastrophically wrong answers on topics I know well, I do not trust them <em>at all</em> on topics I don’t already know. And if you do trust them, I urge you to spend five minutes asking your favourite one about something you know in detail.</p>
<p>Why do I <a href="https://svpow.com/2023/01/15/these-new-artificial-intelligence-programs-dont-know-what-theyre-talking-about/">keep</a> <a href="https://svpow.com/2024/10/14/more-artificial-intelligence-idiocy/">banging on</a> <a href="https://svpow.com/2024/05/23/another-day-another-catastrophic-ai-failure/">about this</a>? Because we’ve reached an especially toxic phase in the history of AI. A lot of companies have ploughed billions of dollars into the dream of being able to replace human workers with machines, and they are desperate to make us believe it’s going to work — if only so they can cash out their investments while the stocks are still high. We’re in the “pump” phase of an industry-wide pump-and-dump. It would be wise for all to beware getting suckered in.</p>
<p>(<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: LLMs are useful for some classes of queries. I use them a lot to remind me of programming-language idioms, asking questions like “In Go, if I have an object satisfying the <strong>error</strong> interface, how can I determine which specific kind of error structure it is?”. They’re good for this because you can quickly determine whether the answer is correct or not, thanks to the merciless compiler. LLMs are not useless; they’re just way overhyped and misapplied.)</p>
