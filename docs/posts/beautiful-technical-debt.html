    <h1>Beautiful Technical Debt</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

        <p>
 <em>
  What looks like a technical debt in a software solution, might be the most efficient way for people to deliver business value in a given situation. There is a beauty in that, if observed from a distance.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 <em>
  Don&#39;t make paying off technical debt your mission. Use it as a guide to understand the landscape and build solutions.
 </em>
</p>
<p>
 Take a look at that beautiful painting &#34;Pine Tree at Lake Side&#34; by Imoto Tekiho.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
 The pine tree in front looks nothing like the straight pine trees on the right side of the picture. Yet, this lone pine tree fits the landscape - the barren rock above the water.
</p>
<p>
 This crooked shape is the most efficient way for nature to grow on tough terrain. It clings to a rock while withstanding the storms, getting water and nutrients. It is perfect for this environment.
</p>
<p>
 Software solutions are like that. They take time to grow, from an idea to a prototype to a lifetime in production. While this happens, the solutions are affected by various forces of nature: team structures, personal incentives, pandemics, or bottlenecks in company processes. These forces affect the shape. Available resources also matter.
</p>
<p>
 We all want to build understandable and efficient solutions. Creating a mess isn&#39;t in our nature. We prefer straight lines and angles. Nature didn&#39;t invent measuring tape - humans did.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  If there is some &#34;ugliness&#34; in a solution - there usually is a cause.
 </strong>
</p>
<p>
 Maybe a data scientist could not get proper access to the database, not without a temporary workaround. Maybe a software engineer had to comply with a short-lived regulation. Maybe the lead architect was poached by a competitor before he could finish converging everything towards desired architecture.
</p>
<p>
 All these nuances will leave marks on the final product. It is sometimes called technical debt. It is a
 <strong>
  mark of external forces that had to be dealt with for the solution to survive
 </strong>
 . There is immense value and beauty in that.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Don&#39;t just try to pay the technical debt off, but embrace and dig beneath.
 </strong>
 <a href="https://abdullin.com/problem-driven-design/">
  Dig into the problems
 </a>
 , conduct customer interviews with stakeholders, get more data, and validate solutions early.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  Use existing technical debt to guide your questions and product design.
