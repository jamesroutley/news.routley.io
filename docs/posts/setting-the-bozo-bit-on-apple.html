    <h1>Setting the Bozo Bit on Apple</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4500865559583049749" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
The other day I was fighting once again with Apple Music.  Not the service, the app.  What I wanted
to do was simple:  I have some practice recordings for my choir and voice lessons that I want on
my iPhone and Apple Watch.  How hard could it be?</p><p>

Apple:  hold my beer.</p><p>

These are sent via WhatsApp so the audio recordings are mp4 files, which for some bizarre reason 
won&#39;t open in Music and instead open in QuickTime Player, despite definitely being audio files.</p><p>

OK, not a biggie, so export to m4a from QT Player.  Transfer to the machine that has my audio library.   Create
a new playlist, transfer some previous songs over, then try to drop the new m4a&#39;s onto the
open playlist.  No go.  Play around for a while, figure out that the entity that accepts the
drops is the TableView, not the surrounding view.  So you can&#39;t drop the new files into the
empty space below the songs, you have to drop them onto the existing songs.</p><p>

Who programmed this?  Who didn&#39;t pay attention to this when doing QA?  Who approved it for 
release?  iTunes used to be if not the, then certainly a flagship app for Apple.</p><p>

OK, plug in the iPhone, as for some reason wireless transfers don&#39;t seem to be overly reliable.</p><p>

No Finder, I don&#39;t want to back...too late.  Ok, do your backup.   Waiting.  Spinner.  Waiting.  Repeat.  
After a while it says it&#39;s finished.   Unplug and ... the songs are not there.</p><p>

I quit Music.app, relaunch it, and lo-and-behold, the songs are now no longer in the playlist in
Music.app either.  Re-add them, carefully aiming for the table, sync again (hey, it remembered we 
just did a backup and doesn&#39;t try again, kudos!), and now they show up.</p><p>

Whew!  Only took 15 minutes or so, the last time I was futzing with it for over an hour and
the songs never synced.  Or one did and two did not, which is obviously Much Better.</p><p>

How can such basic functionality be this incredibly broken?  And of course this is just one
tiny example, there are legions others, as many others have reported.</p><p>

With this, I noticed that I hadn&#39;t actually expected better.  I knew it <em>should</em>
be better but I hadn&#39;t expected Apple to actually make it work.</p><p>

In other words, I had set the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo_bit">Bozo Bit</a> on
Apple.  By default, when Apple does something new these days, I fully and quietly expect it  
to be broken.  And I am surprised when they actually get something right, like Apple Silicon.
And it wasn&#39;t an angry reaction to anything, in fact, it wasn&#39;t even much
of conscious decision, more a gradual erosion of expectations.</p><p>

It Just Doesn&#39;t Workâ„¢.</p><p>

And that&#39;s sad.</p>
