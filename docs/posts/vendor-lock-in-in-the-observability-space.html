    <h1>Vendor lock-in in the observability space</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div fs-codehighlight-theme="base16/black-metal" fs-codehighlight-element="code"><h2>TL;DR</h2><p>In the world of observability, vendor lock-in slows progress and spikes costs. </p><p>OpenTelemetry broke some chains but didn&#39;t free us entirely.</p><p>This post shows the bridge between talk and action and how platforms like Keep offer flexibility, interoperability, cost optimization, community-driven support, and an escape from vendor lock-in traps. </p><p>If you maintain &gt;1 observability/monitoring system, are concerned with vendor lock-in, and need help keeping track of what&#39;s going on and where, this post is for you.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/65252c0e7d5e0b055eb48b32/6540cbe0553e58c0982ff6f0_p9n9v2kui8w503e4tueb.jpeg" alt="Vendor Lock-in meme"/></p></figure><p>‍</p><h2>Vendor lock-in in the o11y space</h2><p>Vendor lock-in is a concern that both companies and customers struggle with in the world of SaaS. </p><p>The fear of becoming trapped by a single provider and unable to switch to alternative solutions can choke innovation and inflate costs. </p><p>Platforms like Keep, focusing on data portability and vendor neutrality, offer an escape from such vendor lock-in conditions using an application abstraction layer.</p><figure class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/65252c0e7d5e0b055eb48b32/653e80a443889296cd8ff6b5_CleanShot%202023-10-29%20at%2016.04.01%402x.png" loading="lazy" alt="Using Keep to migrate Alert between platforms"/></p><figcaption>Using Keep to migrate an Alert between 2 different platforms</figcaption></figure><p>We constantly educate our customers that “we are doing everything we can so you won’t be vendor-locked with us.” But to be frank, we all chase the next sticky feature to ensure our customers won&#39;t go anywhere. </p><p>Here&#39;s a legitimate real-world scenario:</p><p>1. You start with Datadog because it&#39;s appealing and super easy to implement</p><blockquote><strong>Charity Majors</strong> (<a href="https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy">@mipsytipsy</a>):</blockquote><p>OpenTelemetry (aka OTel) is a great example and an ambassador of how open standards can break the shackles of vendor lock-in in the observability space.</p><p>Before OTel, every vendor had its own SDK implementation, and switching to (or even just trying out) new vendors was <strong>sh*t</strong>. </p><p>While OTel did break some chains, the above quote teaches us that vendors still have a few aces up their sleeves.</p><p>This is where platforms like Keep come in to bridge the gap between companies who promise one thing but act the other way around:</p><h3>Flexibility in Tool Selection</h3><p>‍</p><p>This approach allows you to gather data and use features from various observability products, including Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Sentry, and others. </p><p>The ability to centralize data from multiple sources means that you&#39;re not limited to a single vendor&#39;s feature list. This flexibility in tool selection is a critical step towards avoiding vendor lock-in.</p><h3>Interoperability and Data Portability</h3><figure class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image"><p><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/65252c0e7d5e0b055eb48b32/653e81b5a3339932266e6a97_CleanShot%202023-10-29%20at%2016.45.04.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>One-click alert migration with Keep</figcaption></figure><p>‍</p><p>By using Keep as your central alert management and automation hub, you&#39;re no longer constrained by the proprietary data formats and APIs of individual vendors. </p><p>Keep acts as an applicative abstraction layer, ensuring that your data can be easily exported and integrated with other tools or platforms. </p><p>This not only safeguards against vendor lock-in but also streamlines the process of transitioning between tools when necessary.</p><h3>Cost Optimization</h3><p>‍</p><p>Keep&#39;s ability to work with various observability products lets you take advantage of cost-effective solutions for different aspects of your observability needs. </p><p>This cost optimization is a significant benefit, as you can choose the most economical tools for your specific use cases and avoid overpaying for unnecessary features.</p><p>We come across many companies who prefer to keep their logs in one tool (for example, Axiom or Coralogix) and their metrics in another tool (for example, Datadog) for cost optimization.</p><h3>Avoiding Lock-In Traps</h3><p>‍</p><p>Keep helps you avoid these traps by providing a vendor-agnostic layer that abstracts away these proprietary features.</p><p>This allows you to retain control over your data and workflows, preventing vendor lock-in tactics from being effective.</p><h3>Open-Source Community and Support</h3><p>‍</p><p>This community-driven approach ensures that the platform remains vendor-agnostic and evolves based on the needs of the users, not a single vendor&#39;s agenda. </p><p>Moreover, this support system can reduce your reliance on a single vendor&#39;s support services.</p><h3>Future-Proofing</h3><p>‍</p><p>Keep&#39;s adaptable architecture ensures that your organization can pivot and adapt to emerging technologies and new observability products without the fear of being locked into outdated solutions.</p><p>---</p><p>In conclusion, Keep&#39;s open and flexible approach to alert management and automation is a game-changer in the battle against vendor lock-in.</p><p>By centralizing and streamlining your observability data while remaining agnostic to the tools you use, Keep provides a foundation for your organization to remain in control, save costs, and embrace innovation without the fear of being tied to a single vendor&#39;s ecosystem.</p><p>It&#39;s a powerful resource in the fight for vendor independence in today&#39;s ever-changing tech landscape and the ever-growing observability world.</p><p>---</p><p>[1] <a href="https://x.com/mipsytipsy/status/1494861690059759616?s=20">Charity&#39;s Tweet</a></p><p>‍</p></div></div></div>
