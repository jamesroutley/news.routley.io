    <h1>Covert Web-to-App Tracking via Localhost on Android</h1>

                <div>
                    <p><b>Q: Why did Facebook stop using this technique on the day of your public release?</b></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> We don’t know ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, but we&#39;re happy to see that Android users
                        are no longer affected by this type abuse after our disclosure (for now).</p>

                    <p><b>Q: Is this research peer-reviewed?</b></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> Our findings were confirmed by certain parties that we disclosed to, but the study
                        isn’t peer-reviewed yet. We chose not to delay public disclosure for the publication cycle due
                        to the severity of the active abuse.</p>

                    <p><b>Q: Did Meta or Yandex disclose this method in their documentation?</b></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> We found no public technical documentation from Meta or Yandex describing this specific
                        localhost-based communication technique. In developer forums, some developers have raised
                        concerns about Pixel scripts contacting localhost, but received no detailed explanation.</p>

                    <p><b>Q: Does this only affect Android users? What about iOS or other platforms?</b></p>
                    <p><b>A:</b> We have only obtained empirical evidence of this web-to-native ID bridging
                        Meta and Yandex web scripts, which exclusively targeted mobile Android users.
                        No evidence of abuse has been observed in iOS browsers and apps that we tested. That said,
                        similar
                        data sharing between iOS browsers and native apps is <i>technically</i> possible.
                        iOS browsers, which are all based on WebKit,
                        <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279249"> allow developers to
                            programmatically establish localhost connections</a> and apps can listen on
                        local ports.
                        It is possible that technical and policy restrictions for running <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/configuring-background-execution-modes">native
                            apps in the background</a> may explain why iOS users were not targeted by these trackers.
                        We note, however, that our iOS analysis is still preliminary and this behavior might have also
                        violated PlayStore policies. Beyond mobile platforms,
                        web-to-native ID bridging could also <a href="https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~frankli/papers/li-imc2021-weblocal.pdf">
                            pose a threat</a> on desktop OSes and smart TV platforms, but
                        we have not yet investigated these platforms.
