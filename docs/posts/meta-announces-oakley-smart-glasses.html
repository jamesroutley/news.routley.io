    <h1>Meta announces Oakley smart glasses</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Meta is announcing its next pair of smart glasses with Oakley. The limited-edition Oakley Meta HSTN (pronounced “how-stuhn”) model costs $499 and is <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn/">available for preorder</a> starting July 11th. Other Oakley models with Meta’s tech will be available starting at $399 later this summer. </p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23922425/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">existing Meta Ray-Ban glasses</a>, the Oakley model features a front-facing camera, along with open-ear speakers and microphones that are built into the frame. After they are paired with a phone, the glasses can be used to listen to music or podcasts, conduct phone calls, or chat with Meta AI. By utilizing the onboard camera and microphones, Meta AI can also answer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/667613/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-ai-detailed-responses-call-a-volunteer">questions about what someone is seeing</a> and even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351013/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-translation-wearables">translate languages</a>. </p><p>Given the Oakley design, Meta is positioning these new glasses as being geared towards athletes. They have an IPX4 water resistance rating and offer double the battery life of the Meta Ray-Bans, providing 8 hours of use, along with a charging case that can power them for up to 48 hours. The built-in camera now shoots in 3K video, up from 1080p for the Meta Ray-Bans. </p><p>The new lineup comes in five Oakley frame and lens combos, all of which are compatible with prescriptions for an extra cost. The frame colors are warm grey, black, brown smoke, and clear, with several lens options available, including transitions. The limited-edition $499 model, available for order starting July 11th, features gold accents and gold Oakley <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oakley.com%2Fen-us%2Flp%2Fprizm" rel="sponsored">PRIZM</a> lenses. The glasses will be on sale in the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Australia, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark.</p><p>Meta recently signed a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253481/meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-ar-glasses-orion-ray-bans-ai-decoder-interview">multi-year deal with EssilorLuxottica</a>, the parent company behind Ray-Ban, Oakley, and other eyewear brands. The Meta Ray-Bans have sold over two million pairs to date, and EssilorLuxottica <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613292/meta-ray-ban-2-million-10-million-capacity-subscription-essilor-luxottica-earnings">recently disclosed</a> that it plans to sell 10 million smart glasses with Meta annually by 2026. “This is our first step into the performance category,” Alex Himel, Meta’s head of wearables, tells me. “There’s more to come.”</p></div></div>
