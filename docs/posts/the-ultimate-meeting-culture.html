    <p><em>FOMO - Fear of missing out</em></p>

<p>

The goal of an exceptional meeting culture is to allow for people to
constructively decline meetings by fully understanding the consequences of their
action.

</p>

<p>Let me explain!</p>

<p>It is common knowledge that office workers in general suffer from a situation of
too many meetings. To be more precise; too many meetings where the value of
their attendance is vague or unclear, either for input or output or
both. Meetings tend to be slow, take forever, not accomplishing the thing that
it was set out to do so a follow up meeting must be scheduled. They tend to drag
out. This is (to no-ones surprise) quite expensive. Head-count multiplied by
time will easily put a lot of meetings at a cost of thousands of euros. Is
that kind of money used effectively during the meeting? Sometimes, sure, but
usually no.</p>

<p>As the size of a meeting goes up, so does the vague invites. Invites where the
person does not have a clear reason to go but will probably join anyway because
of FOMO. Effectively potentially wasting valuable time and focus. Bigger
meetings also tends to makes it harder for people to be active and join in on
the discussion.</p>

<p>On top of all that, people are busy! They have things going on, more things on
their plate than they can comfortably handle and a deadline coming around the
corner. This is normal! Having to go to yet another meeting might be a
make-or-break situation for someone.</p>

<p>Initiating a culture into an organisation is known to be a hard problem, I
don’t intend to solve that. But, if you don’t know what type of meeting culture
that you want, you also don’t know what you are aiming at.</p>

<h2>The purpose of a meeting</h2>

<p>So, what would an efficient and trustworthy meeting culture look like? It all
comes down to the things that takes place when it’s <em>not</em> a meeting. You’ll see!
The challenge is that the in-between things relies on personal discipline, which
is where the <em>expectations from the culture</em> comes in. If you are expected to do
something it has a higher change of getting done.</p>

<p>First, a meeting is primarily <em>not</em> a way to spread knowledge. Knowledge should
be spread in a format that is more resilient to time than our memories (which
are surprisingly untrustworthy over even tiny time scales). For example; written
text. The greatest benefit of text is that it can be asynchronously consumed,
multiple times. Meetings are <strong>primarily</strong> for two things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Brainstorming meetings that identifies problem and/or solutions through
discussion. People with different backgrounds and interests will have
different opinions, which is quite natural. This type of discussion is great
to have in a meeting because there is immediate feedback which can spur
continued probing for certain details and unclarities.</p></li>

<li><p>Making a decision as a group. Before a decision is made everyone will have to
be on-board with both the problem and the solution, and all the edge cases
and other things that are intentionally left to the side.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>During a meeting both of the above points can co-exist, with different topics
and problems.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary</strong>, meetings can definitely be had in order to expand and clarify
knowledge (written text). The goal of such a meeting should be to understand
how to improve the written text to make future meetings like it unnecessary.</p>

<h2>Expectations from the culture</h2>

<p>In order for this whole idea to be sustainable, it requires that people actually
do the work. If this structure starts to break down, people will attend more
meetings than they have to because of the uncertainty of <em>not</em>
attending. Remember, the goal is to <em>get people to decline</em> meetings when that’s
the reasonable choice.</p>

<h3>The host</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>In the meeting invite, include an agenda with rough estimates on how much time
to be spend on each point. Also include if decisions are expected to be made,
since that can be crucial to peoples attendance.</p></li>

<li><p>Make sure that minutes are taken about the discussions. The most important
parts are decisions that have been made and action points for future work.</p></li>

<li><p>Having a moderator that makes sure that discussions are kept on topic and in
time. Keep to the agenda.</p></li>

<li><p>Off-topic problems or other de-railings that comes up are written down and
planned for a future meetings.</p></li>

<li><p>Ending the meeting on time. If there are a need for more discussions, schedule
a new meeting.</p></li>

<li><p>(Bonus): Schedule meetings to HH:50 on the clock. People who have back-to-back
meetings also need to visit the bathroom, get a coffee or just a small break.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>The attendee that accepted</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Don’t show up if you are not interested. Being in a meeting while you ignore
the speaker in favour of reading the news is <em>not</em> considered working. It’s
also kind of rude.</p></li>

<li><p>Be prepared. Usually there are some reading about the topic before the
meeting, to make sure everyone is on the same page. Do your homework.</p></li>

<li><p>Be active in the discussion, weigh in with your opinions and ask for
clarifications if things are unclear.</p></li>

<li><p>Respect the moderator.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>The attendee that declined</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Understand that by declining you waive your right to influence the topic and
potential decisions that will take place (which sounds dramatic, but it’s not).</p></li>

<li><p>Read the minutes.</p></li>

<li><p>Enjoy!</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Scenarios</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>I am only interested in one of the agenda points</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Enter the meeting when that is supposed to be discussed (with some
margin). Since the agenda specifies the amount of time to put on each point, you
can enter when your topic of interest is going up.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t want to miss what the meeting is about</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a valid point, FOMO. However, if you don’t intend to participate, you
should just read the minutes afterwards. <em>Sometimes</em> it’s valuable to hear the
discussions, not just the summarised comments and outcomes. If that’s the case
then you unfortunately have to join the meeting and sit through it proper.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>I don’t have anything to add but I need to know the outcome</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Decline and read the minutes.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>It feels rude to leave the meeting before it’s done</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It might feel rude, I can sympathise with that. But it’s also a waste of
time. If your contributions are done and you have nothing further to participate
with, go back to your desk and do meaningful work. Ideally, there will be a
cultural agreement that makes it okay to leave meetings before they are over,
for this reason.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>We just need to talk this out!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you can but people are going to get pissed because their expectation will
be different from yours. If you intend to have a meeting purely on constructive
discussion, have that in the agenda so that people know what they are getting
into. Also announce that you will take minutes.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>I have another, more important meeting, with slight overlap</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can leave whenever you want and not fear that you are going to miss much,
since there will be minutes.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>Other things always comes up that will be decided and I <em>might</em> need to hear
that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These potential other things will be written down and saved for a future
meeting. The moderator will keep things on topic.</p>

<h2>Personal experience</h2>

<p>I’ve spent seven years in a ~300 people organisation. It’s not a huge
organisation, but it’s definitely not a small one either. Meetings are held all
over the place and the FOMO is strong. What I realised though was that a few
project managers adhered to the principles above, which made it possible for me
to decline their meetings. Because I <em>knew</em> that I would get minutes and there
would be no talking about other things during the meeting just because people
were together.</p>

<p>I trusted these project managers that I would not be kept in the dark,
information wise.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>This meeting could have been an email!</p>

<p>— <em>Basically everyone at some point</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes!</p>
