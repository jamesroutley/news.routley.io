<p data-block-key="giw42">On a weekend morning many years ago, the constant low-level radiation of mailing list fracas led me to idly fantasize of sending a beseeching plaintive-yet-rousing post to one of them:</p><p data-block-key="4f4j5"><i>Do you think there is no darkness in</i> <b><i>my</i></b><i> heart?</i> <i>Do you think I do not also have these impulses to bray, to taunt, to cut down, to lash out with terrible anger, to poison all joy present and future? But I don&#39;t, because</i> <b><i>I am a grown-up</i></b><i>. Part of maturity is doing the constructive thing instead of the destructive thing, pausing and sighing and stifling the childish impatient id.</i></p><p data-block-key="462qe">I didn&#39;t do it. It wouldn&#39;t do any good.</p><p data-block-key="4a18k">Leonard was about to head off to brunch, and I knew I&#39;d feel better if I also went outside, to ensure that I left the flat at least once that day. <i>Bleh, I don&#39;t wanna</i>, inertia said, but I reminded it that I&#39;d be happier if I did. And along the way I should drop off that neglected dry-cleaning. <i>Bleh, I don&#39;t wanna</i>, procrastination said, but I mentally replied that if I didn&#39;t do this errand, it wouldn&#39;t magically get done.</p><p data-block-key="cm54h">And I suddenly, viscerally recognized the proper relationship between the brat inside me and the adult I am. One way to think about sulky obstreperous urges is that they represent a neglected inner child, but in that moment I developed another useful analogy to help me manage them properly: <i>mailing list flamers</i>. The voices of perfectionism, anxiety, impatience, cruelty, and aversion-to-initiating-effort are posters on <code>sumana-l</code> who talk a lot more than they contribute. I&#39;m not going to killfile any of them, just try to skim, roll my eyes, and move on.</p><p data-block-key="1vi6t">That makes sense, for me, when it comes to counterproductive urges and emotions. But then there are pernicious <i>beliefs</i>. <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2020/on-realizing-there-was-still-some-american-exceptionalism-lurking-in-my-brain/">American exceptionalism</a> is one example. Or <a href="http://harihareswara.net/posts/2023/teaching-entitlement-and-the-verb-need/">&#34;I don&#39;t need or deserve for this situation to be better than it is.&#34;</a> I find with dismay how hard it is to even notice that I still secretly hold these beliefs, much less to thoroughly dislodge and uproot them.</p><p data-block-key="ahefb">And one analogy that comes to mind is that farming in New England soil means ploughing up rocks and setting them aside, forever, and I need to just accept that this is part of the process because of the inherent features of the landscape.</p><p data-block-key="69cbv">But that&#39;s more a picturesque analogy than a salient one, to me. And a few weeks ago I thought of another one that immediately sank in: <i>those email lists that make it really hard to unsubscribe</i>. I&#39;ve tried! I&#39;ve replied with <code>UNSUBSCRIBE</code>, I&#39;ve clicked the &#34;remove me&#34; link, and still they trickle in. And, in this analogy, I haven&#39;t been issued a system that lets me label those emails as spam or automatically filter them to the trash, bypassing my inbox -- and at first I couldn&#39;t even see the &#34;<code>From:</code>&#34; line!</p><p data-block-key="8go3q">I&#39;m making progress with these poisonous newsletters, once I realize that&#39;s what they are. I&#39;m getting better at skimming and trashing them. Hope you are too.</p>
