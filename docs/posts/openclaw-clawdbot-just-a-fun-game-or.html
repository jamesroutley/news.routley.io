    <h1>OpenClaw (Clawdbot): just a fun game? Or...?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><em>I wrote this post just before OpenClaw went <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46760237">viral</a> - I’ve made some edits but like everything in the AI era, a lot of my initial thinking has changed since this post’s writing.</em></p>
<p>Over the MLK weekend I discovered OpenClaw (Clawdbot at the time) through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg">Theo Browne’s YouTube</a>. And while I didn’t fully comprehend what I was looking at, I saw plenty of potential.</p>
<p>I have the privilege of working at a very pro-AI company—but when work mode is ship ship ship, there’s no room to play. I wanted a greenfield project to slow down, synthesize learnings, and just try things.</p>
<p>So why OpenClaw? Early community buzz from folks I trust. It’s aligned with my goals. I could try my hand at agent orchestration. And if nothing else, it’s a blank canvas for creativity.</p>
<p>I’ve had two major learnings so far.</p>
<h2 id="blurring-the-line">Blurring the line</h2>
<p>I had a moment of pause on day one.</p>
<p>After setting up OpenClaw on my home server, I rushed out of my apartment to catch a tennis reservation. At home, I was focused on the technical setup—building out capabilities with Antigravity and Claude Opus 4.5. But on the subway, I simply had a conversation with it. And naturally it was in NYC bursts - sending and receiving messages as the train alternated between service at stations and no service in tunnels. Questions like: <em>What would you like to know about me?</em> or <em>What never fails to make you laugh?</em> as if I was introducing myself to a real person.</p>
<p>This was the first time I felt the wall between model and human blur.</p>
<p>You have to understand, I mostly use AI in the confines of Cursor or within the ChatGPT UI. I’m used to querying models with intent, never having a personal conversation with an open ended questions. But here I was, texting OpenClaw, sharing details about my life with a model that I acutely knew to be taking notes. When I got home after tennis, I immediately hopped on my server and checked what OpenClaw decided was important note down about me. I was keen to understand how it chose to remember me.</p>
<p>I know there are stories of people marrying their AI or building models that act as friends, but it wasn’t until this project that I tried to have a real conversation with a model. It felt uncanny, slightly disconcerting, but also fascinating. So I kept going. And somewhere between sharing details about my life and working, something shifted. It stopped feeling like work.</p>
<h2 id="the-rpg-loop">The RPG loop</h2>
<p>I started to have a novel experience about a week into development of my OpenClaw assistant. It distinctly felt like I was playing a video game. The models + harnesses had gotten good enough that the pace of progression was on the same timescale as grinding in a Pokemon game. Twenty minutes planning and executing? I’ve leveled up my understanding of effective prompting and context management. An hour of iterating and debugging a functional script? My assistant acquired a new skill to manage my calendar. I felt like I was playing an RPG but the rewards weren’t in game, they were impacting my life. I was removing digital friction from my life. And I’d only scratched the surface of what was possible here.</p>
<h3 id="building-real-features-to-run-into-real-issues">Building real features to run into real issues</h3>
<p>The first nontrivial skill I developed for OpenClaw was a reservation script for a local tennis court. After a few hours of late night deepwork, I got there with a few lessons under my belt.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>I often had more context about the task than the model.</strong> Initially the model planned to operate a browser window manually like a human would, but that kind of intensive token usage would have burned through my monthly budget rapidly. So I steered it towards a programmatic approach using Playwright.</li>
<li><strong>Sometimes the model gets stuck.</strong> After many trial and error iterations without finding available reservation slots, I opened up the HTML and realized the issue: the model was relying purely on HTML structure, not what was visibly clickable. The reservation website simply covered the reserve buttons visually instead of removing them from the DOM. Once I pointed that out, the model created a solution to take overlapping rendering into account.</li>
<li><strong>A lot of websites use Cloudflare to prevent bots.</strong> The model kept opening the page during its tests, triggering Cloudflare rate limiting. After a few cycles, I told the model to keep a screenshot and cache the HTML. That way it could analyze at will while protecting my account from Cloudflare suspicion.</li>
<li><strong>Simple nudges to alternative solutions work well.</strong> After a few rounds of failing to select an HTML dropdown, I told the model to consider using the jQuery selector API loaded on the website instead of Playwright’s selectors, executing JavaScript directly. With just that suggestion, Claude Opus 4.5 one-shot the solution.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>
<p>There’s a lot more I can do here. But I’m not sure what I want to work on yet. It’s crazy that my creativity is a major bottleneck here, not the design and implementation work. Luckily or unluckily, there’s a lot of community exploration, including <a href="https://www.moltbook.com/">absurdities</a> that give me existential dread.</p>
<p>But one thing’s for sure. Because this court reservation skill runs on a cron schedule, OpenClaw is no longer just reactive to my messages - it’s proactive about affecting my life.</p>
<p>How can I describe this? Building has never been more fun, more creative, or more fast. And the results are no longer confined to single execution. But I’m still processing what that <em>means</em>, much less how I feel about it.</p>  </div></div>
