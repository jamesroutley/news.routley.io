            <span>Abstract:</span>Efficiently solving nonlinear equations underpins numerous scientific and engineering disciplines, yet scaling these solutions for complex system models remains a challenge. This paper presents NonlinearSolve.jl - a suite of high-performance open-source nonlinear equation solvers implemented natively in the Julia programming language. NonlinearSolve.jl distinguishes itself by offering a unified API that accommodates a diverse range of solver specifications alongside features such as automatic algorithm selection based on runtime analysis, support for GPU-accelerated computation through static array kernels, and the utilization of sparse automatic differentiation and Jacobian-free Krylov methods for large-scale problem-solving. Through rigorous comparison with established tools such as Sundials and MINPACK, NonlinearSolve.jl demonstrates unparalleled robustness and efficiency, achieving significant advancements in solving benchmark problems and challenging real-world applications. The capabilities of NonlinearSolve.jl unlock new potentials in modeling and simulation across various domains, making it a valuable addition to the computational toolkit of researchers and practitioners alike.
