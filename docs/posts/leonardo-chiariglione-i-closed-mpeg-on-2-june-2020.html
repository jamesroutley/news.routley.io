									<p><span>I needed an organisation that would</span><em> create digital media standards for <span>consumers</span> to seamlessly communicate and <span>industry</span> operate in a global market of interoperable products, services and applications</em><span>. </span><span>I conceived </span><span>t</span><span>hat organisation </span><span>in 1987, established it in 1988</span><span>I, and called </span><span> </span><a href="http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/">Moving Picture Experts Group</a><span> (MPEG). In four years, </span><span>MPEG had </span><span>ushered in the </span><span><i>digital media age </i><span>with </span></span><span>MPEG-1, </span><span>a standard for interactive media </span><span>used in Video CD, digital audio broadcasting (MP2), and personal music (MP3). Starting from the mid ’90s, MPEG-2, the result of the second MPEG project, became the common infrastructure that underpinned distribution of digital television via cable, satellite, terrestrial networks and package media (DVD). MPEG-4, the third standard first released in 1988, opened the way to digital media distribution over the internet. Several families of standards followed: MPEG-7, MPEG-21, </span><span>MPEG-A, MPEG-H, MPEG-I and more.</span></p><p><span>I chaired the group </span><span>fostering its productivity with the development of over 200 standards, membership with a 20-fold growth in attendance </span><span>from the initial 29 experts attending the first meeting, and scope extending from media to genomics, the “born digital” data of the world.. </span></p><p><span>I closed MPEG on 2 June 2020 when I left because </span><span>obscure forces</span><span> had hijacked it. </span></p><p>Even before it has ceased to exists, the MPEG engine had run out of steam – technology- and business wise. The same obscure forces that have hijacked MPEG had kept it hostage to their interests impeding its technical development and keeping it locked to outmoded Intellectual Property licensing models delaying market adoption of MPEG standards. Industry has been strangled <span>and consumers have been deprived of the benefits of new technologies. From </span><span>facilitators </span><span>of new opportunities and experiences, MPEG s</span><span>tandards have morphed from </span><span> into </span><span>roadblocks.</span></p><p>On the 19th of July 2020 I proposed and, on 30 September 2020, a group of 33 companies established the <a href="http://mpai.community/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Moving Picture, Audio and Data Coding by Artificial Intelligence</a> (MPAI). Industry and consumers have now an organisation developing standards based on powerful technologies, overcoming stagnation and licensing stalemates. Five standards covering <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-aif/">execution of AI applications</a>, <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-cae/">audio enhancement</a>, <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-mmc/">multimodal conversation</a>, <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-cui/">company performance prediction</a>, and <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-gme/">ecosystem governance</a> have been developed and adopted. More standards are in the pipeline: <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-eev/">AI-based End-to-End Video Coding</a>, <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-evc/">AI-Enhanced Video Coding</a>, <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-aih/">AI Health</a>, <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-ara/">Avatar Representation and Animation</a>, <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-cav/">Connected Autonomous Vehicles</a>, <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-mmm/">Metaverse Model</a>,  <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-spg/">Server-based Predictive Multiplayer Gaming</a>, and <a href="https://mpai.community/standards/mpai-xrv/">XR Venues</a>.</p><p>The book <a href="https://leonardo.chiariglione.org/publications/even-the-stars-die/"><em>Even the stars die</em></a> tell the MPEG story from birth to death and the MPAI story from birth to growth to death. The book <a href="https://mpai.community/the-mpai-book-2021/"><em>Towards Pervasive and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence</em></a> tells the MPAI story in its first 15 months of life: 5 standards produced and 7 projects under way1998.</p>								</div>
