<p>Since joining the indie hacker community a few months ago, I&#39;ve been observing what everyone is doing with great curiosity. One thing I immediately noticed, is that everyone talks about &#34;build in public&#34;. In case you&#39;re unfamiliar with the term:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(build in public) is an intentional practice of <strong>creating content and sharing your company’s story as it unfolds — with transparency, openness and vulnerability</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><em><a href="https://buildinpublic.xyz/what-is-build-in-public">What is building in public?</a></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>A common practice of build in public is to share the revenue of your products. I picked a random tweet just to showcase what it looks like:</p>

<p><img alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9c28944-bbcf-446f-86da-5cf4fef6964b"/></p>

<p>At first I thought, &#34;OK, everyone is doing it, it must be good&#34;. But a few months later, I&#39;m starting to have some questions.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-question-are-people-overdoing-it">My first question: <strong>are people overdoing it?</strong></h2>

<p>If you follow enough indiehackers like me, Twitter/X will start recommending posts for you. When I said &#34;random tweet&#34;, I really meant it: similar posts are all over my timeline, and I literally picked the first one which took less than 5 secs. Based on my observation, out of 10 &#34;build in public&#34; posts, probably 5 or 6 are sharing revenue, mixed with posts like &#34;how I boosted sales 100x in 3 months&#34;.</p>

<p>To be clear, I&#39;m not against these posts. If I crossed the 1k milestone, I want to share it with the world too. But the issue is that, <strong>it seems people are more willing to post about their achievements, rather than ideas and plans about their products</strong>. Maybe it&#39;s because the achievement posts attract more attention? I don&#39;t know. But if I follow someone because of a product, I&#39;m more interested in the product itself than the <em>person</em> behind it: I want to know what features are being added, what are the long-term plans, etc. Though, It could just be me.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <strong>it feels like some of the posts are merely just bragging</strong>. Sure, you made 10k, 100k MMR, congratulations. But do you really need to talk about it repeatedly like every day? How does it benefit the customers/followers, what value does it bring? None. It&#39;s just clickbait. Once and twice, it&#39;s inspiring and eye-opening, but more times, it just gets boring.</p>

<h2 id="my-second-question-does-it-actually-work">My second question: <strong>does it actually work?</strong></h2>

<p>Ten years ago, when @levelsio was still a nobody, &#34;build in public&#34; was a brand new thing. You see, when everyone still followed the traditional route of build -&gt; launch (mostly as a one-off effort), suddenly there&#39;s this guy who started sharing everything in a way that no one had seen before: what he was building, what worked and what did not, how much he made, etc. This naturally gained him a lot of attention and made him famous (ofc, along with good products).</p>

<p>Back in the days, &#34;indiehacking&#34; was also new, with few people doing it. Nowadays, things are completely different. The &#34;Build in Public&#34; community on Twitter has <strong>33.3k</strong> members, r/indiehackers has <strong>20k</strong> members, and indiehackers.com has <strong>100K</strong> subscribers. The field of indiehacker is no longer a deserted square at midnight, it&#39;s now flooded with people: young students who dropped out of college, people who quit their 9-5 jobs to peruse a bigger dream, and people who get laid off and decided to never do it again. As <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=indiehacker,indie%20hacker&amp;hl=en">Google trends</a> shows, before Oct 2016, there were little searches of &#34;indiehacker&#34; or &#34;indie hacker&#34;. Look at what it is today. </p>

<p>You might have guessed what I&#39;m want to say:</p>

<p><strong>When everyone builds in public, no one builds in public.</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s admit it, the main purpose of build in public is to attract attention and build a community, so you can keep selling products. But when everyone is doing so (and some doing it exceptionally well), how much attention can you get?</p>

<p>It&#39;s weird to say this, but let&#39;s not forget that it&#39;s still the product that ultimately matters. Many successful indiehackers and solopreneurs don&#39;t build in public, or at least not in the popular way. Nick Moore (who built <a href="https://www.popclip.app/">PopClip</a>) tweets very little, and posted to the user forum only when there&#39;s a big update. Danny Lin (who built <a href="https://orbstack.dev/">OrbStack</a>) never shared its revenue, and only tweets occasionally. They build some of the best softwares that ever existed, and they don&#39;t build in public. All I&#39;m trying to say is, build in public may be good and work for some, but it&#39;s not the only way, and you (as an indiehacker) should not feel any pressure for not doing it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m still new and exploring. I wrote about my questions, but I don&#39;t believe I have an answer for them. If you&#39;d like to discuss more on this topic, I&#39;m on <a href="https://twitter.com/laike9m">Twitter/X</a> and <a href="https://mastodon.social/@laike9m">Mastodon</a>.</p>
