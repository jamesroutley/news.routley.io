This included exploration, clustering, creating visualizations, and zooming in on what (to me personally) seems like some of the best discussions on here.</p><p>Three things in this post:</p><p>1- The interesting groups of HN posts</p><p>2- The interactive visualizations that you can explore in your browser</p><p>3- The data from this exploration -- this includes CSV of the titles as well as the text embeddings of 3,000 Ask HN articles.</p><p>Blog post about this whole process here: [1]</p><p>============</p><p>1- The interesting groups of HN posts</p><p>From the exploration, Ask HN proved the most interesting.

Each group contains about 400 posts.</p><p>- Life experiences and advice threads [2]</p><p>- Technical and personal development [3]</p><p>- Software career insights, advice, and discussions [4]</p><p>- General content recommendations (blogs/podcasts) [5]</p><p>============</p><p>2- The interactive visualizations that you can explore in your browser</p><p>- Top 10,000 Hacker News articles of all time [6]</p><p>- Top 3,000 posts in Ask HN [7]</p><p>============</p><p>3- The data from this exploration</p><p>CSV file of top 3K Ask HN posts: [8]</p><p>The sentence embeddings of the titles of those posts: [9]</p><p>This is a colab notebook containing the code examples (including loading these two data files): [10]</p><p>============</p><p>If you&#39;ve ever wanted to get into language models, this is a good place to start.
