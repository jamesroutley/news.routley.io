				<p id="speakable-summary">A day after reporters published their first hands-on review of Apple’s Vision Pro, the technology giant released its first security patch for the mixed reality headset to fix a vulnerability that “may have been exploited” by hackers in the wild.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Apple released visionOS 1.0.2, the software that runs on the Vision Pro, with a fix for a vulnerability in WebKit, the browser engine that runs Safari and other web apps. Apple said the bug, if exploited, allowed malicious code to run on an affected device.</p>
<p>It’s the same vulnerability that Apple patched last week when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/23/iphone-users-should-turn-on-apples-stolen-device-protection-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it rolled out iOS 17.3</a>, which included fixes for iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple TV — all of which rely on WebKit. No patches for this bug, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214070" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially tracked as CVE-2024-23222</a>, were released for Apple Watch.</p>
<p>It’s not immediately clear if malicious hackers used the vulnerability to specifically exploit Apple’s Vision Pro, and Apple spokesperson Scott Radcliffe would not say when asked by TechCrunch.</p>
<p>It also isn’t yet known who was exploiting the vulnerability, or for what reason.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for malicious actors, such as spyware makers, to target weaknesses in WebKit as a way to break into the device’s underlying operating system and the user’s personal data. WebKit bugs can sometimes be exploited when a victim visits a malicious domain in their browser, or the in-app browser.</p>
<p>Apple rolled out several patches for WebKit bugs last year.</p>
<p>Vision Pro is expected to be available starting Friday.</p>
