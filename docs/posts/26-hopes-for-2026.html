<p>Not so new tradition, activate! I&#39;ve done <a href="https://nik.art/23-hopes-for-2023">23 hopes for 2023</a>, <a href="https://nik.art/24-hopes-for-2024">24 for 2024</a>, and <a href="https://nik.art/25-hopes-for-2025">25 for 2025</a>. In 2025 I&#39;d say I made a good try at or achieved about half, which isn&#39;t bad, but a lot of them were more vibes based.</p>
<p>Without further rambling:</p>
<ol>
<li>I hope to put down roots and make a ton of local friends.</li>
<li>I hope to build more online community. I&#39;m a member of a few cool discords and a small social media platform but want to really give it a good try and see what can be done about this &#34;dead/alive internet&#34; stuff.</li>
<li>I hope to pitch a non-fiction book! Maybe about systemic sublime stuff, technopaganism and what it means to me, or just generally about internet infrastucture? Writing a proposal sounds hard so giving myself a year to faff around.</li>
<li>I hope to regularly do a mutual aid/volunteering/similar gig.</li>
<li>I hope that the AI bubble bursts with minimal pain to the many, and much pain to the few who orchestrated this mess.</li>
<li>I hope I get a better handle on my &#34;personal style&#34;.</li>
<li>I hope to finish a singular (1) personal coding project, which may sound unambitious but I have <code>git init</code>-ed so much I have never touched again, we&#39;re keeping it realistic.</li>
<li>I hope that I get into powerlifting in a big and sustainable way.</li>
<li>I hope I&#39;m able to keep up listening to at least one new-to-me album a week for the whole of 2026.</li>
<li>I hope I keep celebrating bigly, beautifully and boldly, even if it seems silly to other people.</li>
<li>J&#39;espère apprendre le français!</li>
<li>I hope to find a way to learn Yoruba, and people to practice with.</li>
<li>I hope I learn to be tidier and to keep spaces functional with more ease.</li>
<li>I hope I read at least a little bit of a book most days of the rest of my life, but starting with 2026 would be great.</li>
<li>I hope to visit some friends who have moved away from very near to me.</li>
<li>I hope I start to appreciate face-to-face interaction more in itself, instead of &#34;I&#39;m glad that the other person is really happy to see me in person&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m glad that we get to meet cos they would never video call/message/etc&#34;.</li>
<li>I hope I start calling people more, on purpose.</li>
<li>I hope I keep up yearly planning and these hopes blogs for many more years! I&#39;ve been yearly planning at least since 2016!!!! One decade down!</li>
<li>I hope I get my sewing ambitions to be sewing reality this year.</li>
<li>I hope I learn more ways to wield perfectionism like a sword to battle with, rather than with the blade turned at myself.</li>
<li>I hope I write on this blog regularly, as well as my newsletter, and for YouTube stuff.</li>
<li>I hope I keep up my awe-based practices and find more ways to help myself and others recognise the majesty of existing creation, the created, and the act of creation.</li>
<li>I hope I make more friends who like computers, and also more friends who like, and see the potential of, social media. But not in awful ways, if that makes any sense?</li>
<li>I hope I keep my values and priorities in mind for the entire year, as it seems pretty clear right now what I want, but obviously never stays that way!</li>
<li>I hope for internal growth, and external growth that serves and sustains me!</li>
<li>I hope you have hope for next year, and you get what you want and need and deserve.</li>
</ol>
<p>Happy new year! What are you hoping for in 2026?</p>
