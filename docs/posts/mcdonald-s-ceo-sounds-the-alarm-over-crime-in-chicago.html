a Starbucks spokesperson told CNN Business at the time. </p><p>Like Kempczinski, Starbucks&#39; leaders said that national and community dynamics tend to play out in their stores. </p><div><div><div><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/business/starbucks-closures/index.html"><img alt="Starbucks CEO on store closings: &amp;#39;There are going to be many more&amp;#39;" data-src-mini="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220719101002-starbucks-closing-stores-file-restricted-small-169.jpg" data-src-xsmall="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220719101002-starbucks-closing-stores-file-restricted-medium-plus-169.jpg" data-src-small="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220719101002-starbucks-closing-stores-file-restricted-large-169.jpg" data-src-medium="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220719101002-starbucks-closing-stores-file-restricted-exlarge-169.jpg" data-src-large="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220719101002-starbucks-closing-stores-file-restricted-super-169.jpg" data-src-full16x9="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220719101002-starbucks-closing-stores-file-restricted-full-169.jpg" data-src-mini1x1="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220719101002-starbucks-closing-stores-file-restricted-small-11.jpg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0, xsmall: 221, small: 308, medium: 461, large: 781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/></a></div></div></div><p>Starbucks employees are &#34;seeing firsthand the challenges facing our communities,&#34; Debbie Stroud and Denise Nelsen, senior vice presidents of US operations at Starbucks, wrote in an open letter to employees in July. &#34;With stores in thousands of communities across the country, we know these challenges can, at times, play out within our stores too.</p><p>Kempczinski highlighted another challenge as well.</p><p>&#34;For McDonald&#39;s<strong>, </strong>though, the issue isn&#39;t<strong> </strong>just about conditions in stores — it&#39;s also about recruiting leaders to the company&#39;s headquarters and convincing corporate workers to return to the office,&#34; the CEO said.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s more difficult today for me to convince a promising McDonald&#39;s executive to relocate to Chicago from one of our other offices than it was just a few years ago,&#34; he said. &#34;It&#39;s more difficult for me to recruit a new employee to McDonald&#39;s, to join us in Chicago than it was in the past.&#34; </p><p>And when it comes to returning to the office, he said, &#34;one of the things that I hear from our employees [is] ... &#39;I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s safe to come downtown.&#39;&#34;
