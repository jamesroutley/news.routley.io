and was shot down over Yukon in north-west Canada.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Both Canadian and US aircraft were scrambled to track down the object which Mr Trudeau says was taken out by a US F-22 fighter jet.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is the third object to be shot down over North America in the last week.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The American military destroyed a Chinese balloon last weekend, and on Friday an unspecified object the size of a small car was shot down off Alaska.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Trudeau confirmed on Saturday he gave the order and had spoken with US President Joe Biden.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Canadian forces will now recover and analyse the wreckage of the object,&#34; he wrote on Twitter.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The latest unspecified object was flying over central Yukon at about 40,000 ft (12,000m) and intercepted at about 15:41 local time on Saturday, defence minister Anita Anand told reporters.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She described it as &#34;small&#34; and &#34;cylindrical&#34;, but that recovery efforts are still being carried out to discover more details.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ms Anand said it was taken out &#34;about 100 miles&#34; from the US border, adding it posed a &#34;reasonable threat to civil aviation&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She said it &#34;appears to be smaller than the one shot down off the coast of South Carolina&#34; <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64524105">last Saturday</a> - meaning the giant Chinese suspected spy balloon that measured 200ft (60m) tall.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Posting earlier on Twitter, Prime Minister Trudeau thanked the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) which carries out air defence for the US and Canada and led the mission.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The White House said the object had been tracked and monitored &#34;over the last 24 hours&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Out of an abundance of caution and at the recommendation of their militaries, President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau authorised it to be taken down,&#34; it said. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;The leaders discussed the importance of recovering the object in order to determine more details on its purpose or origin.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Reuters</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Canada&#39;s Minister of National Defence Anita Anand said the object posed a threat to civil aviation</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Giving more details on the mission to take down the object, the US Department of Defense confirmed two F-22 jets took off from a military base in Anchorage, Alaska and the object was shot down with an AIM 9X missile.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Pentagon Press Secretary Brig Gen Pat Ryder added that the FBI will be &#34;working closely&#34; with Canadian police.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Separately on Saturday, the US military also scrambled fighter jets over Montana as some airspace was closed - but it turned out to be a &#34;radar anomaly&#34; and nothing unusual was found.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The latest object&#39;s appearance over North America comes just a week after a suspected Chinese spy balloon was also destroyed by the US.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>On Friday another unspecified object was tracked and shot down over Alaska at the orders of US President Biden. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In a short statement, the military said US troops, including from the Alaska National Guard, were still conducting search and recovery activities on sea ice for Friday&#39;s object.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It said it had no further details about the object&#39;s capabilities, purpose or origin but confirmed the FBI is helping with the recovery near the Alaskan town of Deadhorse.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;Arctic weather conditions, including wind chill, snow, and limited daylight, are a factor in this operation, and personnel will adjust recovery operations to maintain safety,&#34; it added - and that the rescue operation will continue as weather permits.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Last weekend, defence officials told US media that debris from the Chinese balloon landed in 47ft (14m) of water - shallower than they had expected - near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>China has denied the balloon - which first entered US airspace on 28 January - was used for spying purposes, saying it was a weather device gone astray.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The US, however, said the balloon is part of a fleet of surveillance balloons that have flown over five continents.</p></div><div data-component="video-block"><figure><div></div><figcaption><span>Media caption, </span><p>Video appears to show China balloon shot down</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The balloon incident has strained US-China relations, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken cancelling a planned trip to Beijing.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Chinese officials on Friday accused the US of &#34;political manipulation and hype&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In an interview on Thursday, President Biden defended his handling of the Chinese balloon, maintaining that it was not &#34;a major breach&#34;.</p></div></article></div></div>
