<h2>Is Abandoning the Internet</h2>

<SPAN face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">
As a venture capitalist who invests in high
tech, I have to worry that the web will be perceived as an increasingly
corrupt police state overlying a maze of dark alleys and unsafe practices
outside the rule of law.  The public and many corporations will be reluctant
to embrace a technology fraught with such problems.  The Internet economy will
continue to grow, but it will do so at a much slower pace than forecast by
industry analysts.

<h3>Bad Neighbourhood</h3>

<p>
In 1970–1971 I used to live in a <em>really bad</em>
neighbourhood.  In the space of two years I was held up three
times, twice by the same guy.  (One&#39;s sense of etiquette fails
in such circumstances—what do you say: “New gun?”)  Once I
found a discarded sofa cushion outside my apartment building
and, being perennially short on seating for guests, rescued it
from the trash man.  After bringing it inside and whacking it
to liberate some of the dust prior to vacuuming, I heard a
little “ker-tink” sound on the floor.  Three times.  These
turned out to be caused by .22 calibre bullets whose entry
holes were visible upon closer examination of the pillow.  I
know not whether this ballast was added while it was sitting on
the sidewalk or in the apartment of the neighbour who threw it
away.  The sound of gunfire wasn&#39;t all that rare on Saturday
nights there, then.
</p>

<h3>Getting Out of Dodge</h3>

<p>
Looking back on that time, I don&#39;t recall any sense of chronic
fear or paranoia, but there&#39;s a low level edginess which slowly
grinds you down.  Now, I <em>could</em> have gotten a large,
intimidating dog, put bars on the apartment window and motion
detectors inside with triple deadlocks on the door, a concealed
carry permit and suitable heat to pack, Kevlar vest for going
out after dark, etc., etc.  Instead, immediately I received a
raise which permitted it, I decided to get out of Dodge, as it
were, trading 50% higher rent for a sense of security which
freed me to worry about career-related matters instead of
whether my career was about to be abruptly truncated due to
collision with rapidly moving metallic projectiles.
</p>

<h3>The Internet Slum</h3>

<p>
I&#39;ve come to view today&#39;s Internet as much like the bad
neighbourhood I used to inhabit.  It wasn&#39;t always that way—in
fact, as recently as a few years ago, the Internet seemed like
a frontier town—a little rough on the edges, with its share of
black hats, but also with the sense of open-ended possibility
that attracted pioneers of all sorts, exploring and expanding
the cutting edge in all directions: technological, economic,
social, political, and artistic.  But today&#39;s Internet isn&#39;t a
frontier any more—it&#39;s a slum.  (I use “Internet” here to
refer to the culture of the Web, E-mail, newsgroups, and other
services based upon the underlying packet transport network.  I
have nothing against packet switching networks in general nor
the Internet infrastructure in particular.)
</p>

<h3>One Fine Day at Fourmilab</h3>

<p>
What&#39;s it like living today in the Internet slum?  What comes down that
pipe into your house from the outside world?  Here&#39;s a snapshot,
taken on March 31st, 2004, a completely typical day in all regards.
The Web site racked up 682,516 hits in 56,412 visits from
44,776 distinct sites (IP addresses), delivering 14.8 gigabytes
of content.  That&#39;s, of course, not counting the traffic
generated by the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/security/incidents/ddos_2004-01/" target="is_aux">Distributed
Denial of Service Attack</a> underway since late January 2004.
Whoever is responsible for this attack bombarded the site with
a total of 1,473,602 HTTP request packets originating from 1951
hosts all around the world.  These packets were blocked by the
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/gardol/" target="is_aux">Gardol</a>
attack detector and packet blocker I spent much of February
developing instead of doing productive work.  Well, the attack
this day was only half as intense as during the first wave
in January.  Entirely apart from this recent denial of service attack
is the routine attack against
<cite><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/earthview/" target="is_aux">Earth and Moon Viewer</a></cite>
in which robots attempt to overload the server and/or outbound
bandwidth by making repeated requests for large custom images.
This attack has been underway for several years despite its
impact having been entirely mitigated by countermeasures installed
in October 2001; still they keep trying.  This day a total of
3700 of these attacks originating from 342 distinct hosts were
detected and blocked.

<img src="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/netslum/figures/spamstat.png" width="559" height="404" alt="Mail and Spam per month: 2000-2004"/>
</p>

<p>
Moving from the Web to that other Internet mainstay, E-mail,
let&#39;s take a peek at the traffic on good old port 25.  This day
I received 8 E-mail messages from friends and colleagues around the
globe.  Isn&#39;t E-mail great?  But
that&#39;s not <em>all</em> that arrived that day….
First of all, we have the 629 messages which were blocked as originating
at IP addresses known to be open SMTP relays which permit mass junk
mailers to forge the origin of their garbage.  Open relays, whether
due to misconfiguration or operated as a matter of principle by
self-described
<a href="http://www.toad.com/gnu/verio-censorship.html" target="is_aux">civil
libertarians</a>, are the E-mail equivalent of leaving a live
hand grenade in an elementary school playground.  A peek at the <tt>sendmail</tt>
log shows a total of 6,444 “dictionary spams” attempted that day.
These are hosts which connect to your mail server and try names
from huge lists of names culled from directories used by spammers
in the hope of hitting a valid address which can be sent
spam and then re-sold to other spammers.  A total of 275 E-mail messages
made it past these filters into the hands of <tt>sendmail</tt>
for delivery, being addressed to a valid user name in my
domain, usually the E-mail address which I take care not to
publish on any of my Web pages.  Of these, a total of 259
were correctly identified as spam by
<cite><a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/annoyance-filter/" target="is_aux">Annoyance Filter</a></cite>,
the adaptive Bayesian junk mail filter I spent two months developing
in 2002 instead of doing productive work.  A total of 8 junk mail
messages were “false negatives”—misclassified as legitimate mail
by <cite>Annoyance Filter</cite> (in all likelihood because I hadn&#39;t
recently re-trained the filter with a collection of
contemporary spam) and made it to my mailbox.  This day&#39;s
collection of junk mail included a total of 74 attempts to
corrupt my computer with destructive worm software, thereby to
enlist it in further propagating the corruption. Since the
machine on which I read mail uses none of the vulnerable
Microsoft products these programs exploit, they pose no risk
to me, but consider how many people with computers which are at
risk without the filtering tools and the more than 35 years of
computing experience I bring to the arena withstand this daily
assault.  This day there wasn&#39;t a single criminal fraud attempt
to obtain my credit card number or other financial identity
information; this was a light day; usually there&#39;s one or two.
Absent the open relay block list and 
<cite>Annoyance Filter</cite>, I would be forced to sort
through a total of 896 pieces of junk mail to read the 8 messages
I wish to receive.  Isn&#39;t E-mail great?
</p>

<p>
Ever since 1996, when a dysfunctional superannuated adolescent
exploited a vulnerability in the ancient version of
Solaris I then ran on my Web server to break into the server
and corrupt my Web site, I&#39;ve kept the local network here at
Fourmilab behind a firewall configured with all the (abundant)
paranoia I can summon.  A firewall not only protects one
against the barbarians, but monitoring its log lets you know
which
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0451156609/fourmilabwwwfour" target="Amazon_Fourmilab">tommyknockers</a>
are knocking, knocking at your door and
what keys they&#39;re trying in the lock.  One doesn&#39;t bother
logging the boring, repetitive stuff, but it&#39;s wise to keep an
eye peeled for new, innovative attacks. On this day, the
firewall log recorded a total of 1915 packets dropped—the vast
majority attempts to exploit well-known vulnerabilities in
Microsoft products by automated “attack robots” operated by
people who have nothing better to do with their lives.  That&#39;s
about one every 45 seconds.

<h3>The Tunnel in the Basement</h3>

<p>
Imagine if there were a tunnel which ran into your basement
from the outside world, ending in a sturdy door with four or
five high-security locks which anybody could approach
completely anonymously.  A mail slot in the door allows you to
receive messages and news delivered through the tunnel, but
isn&#39;t big enough to allow intruders to enter.  Now imagine that
every time you go down into your basement, you found several
hundred letters piled up in a snowdrift extending from the mail
slot, and that to find the rare messages from your friends and
family you had to sort through reams of pornography of the most
disgusting kind, solicitations for criminal schemes, “human
engineered” attempts to steal your identity and financial
information, and the occasional rat, scorpion, or snake slipped
through the slot to attack you if you&#39;re insufficiently wary.
You don&#39;t allow your kids into the basement any more for fear
of what they may see coming through the slot, and you&#39;re
worried by the stories of people like yourself who&#39;ve had their
basements filled with sewage or concrete spewed through the
mail slot by malicious “pranksters”.
</p>

<p>
Further, whenever you&#39;re in the basement you not only hear the
incessant sound of unwanted letters and worse dropping through
the mail slot, but every minute or so you hear somebody trying
a key or pick in one of your locks.  As a savvy basement tunnel
owner, you make a point of regularly reading tunnel security
news to learn of “exploits” which compromise the locks you&#39;re
using so you can update your locks before miscreants can break
in through the tunnel.  You may consider it wise to install
motion detectors in your basement so you&#39;re notified if an
intruder does manage to defeat your locks and gain entry.
</p>

<p>
As the risks of basement tunnels make the news more and more
often, industry and government begin to draw up plans to
“do something” about them.  A new
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/#TC" target="is_aux">“trusted door”</a> scheme is
proposed, which will replace the existing locks and mail slot
with “inherently secure” versions which you&#39;re not allowed
to open up and examine, whose master keys are guarded by
commercial manufacturers and government agencies entirely
deserving of your trust.
</p>

<p>
You may choose to be patient, put up with the inconveniences and
risks of your basement tunnel until you can install that trusted
door.  Or, you may simply decide that what comes through the tunnel
isn&#39;t remotely worth the aggravation it creates and dynamite
the whole thing, reclaiming your basement for yourself.
</p>

<h3>Abandon the Internet?</h3>

<p>
Is it time to start thinking about abandoning the Internet?
Well, I&#39;ve pondered that option at some length, and I&#39;m not
alone.
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/" target="is_aux">Donald Knuth</a>,
who&#39;s always at least a decade ahead of everybody else,
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html" target="is_aux">abandoned
E-mail</a> on January 1st, 1990, saying “Email is a
wonderful thing for people whose role in life is to be on top
of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of
things.”
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/fourmilog/archives/2004-11/000006.html" target="is_aux">Harry Schultz</a>,
one of the wisest observers of the financial and geopolitical scene,
advised abandoning E-mail in favour of FAX more than a year ago.
While few people have explicitly announced their retirement from the
Internet, I suspect that more and more parents are loath to
provide Internet access to their children, knowing that their
mailboxes will be filled every day with hundreds of disgusting
messages.  People of all sorts simply walk away from the
Internet after suffering the repellent pop-ups and attacks by
spyware installed on their computers.  You won&#39;t see this as a
downturn in people on the Internet, at least right away, but keep
your eye on the second derivative.
</p>

<p>
Another trend I expect to emerge is an attempt to re-create the
Internet of a decade ago by erecting virtual barriers to keep out the
rabble. When I&#39;m feeling down I call it “Internet Gated Communities”,
when in an optimistic mood, “The Faculty Club”.  This may lead to
what many observers refer to as “the Balkanisation of the Internet”—a
fragmentation of the “goes everywhere, reaches everybody” vision
of the global nervous system into disconnected communities.  This
may not be such a bad thing.  Yes, we will
not end up with a ubiquitous global wired community.  But
if you want to get an idea what <em>that</em>
might actually look like, here&#39;s a little experiment you can try.
Turn off your spam filter and <em>read</em> all the spam
you get in a day, including visiting the Web sites they
direct you to.  Now imagine that, multiplied by a factor
of about a hundred.  Welcome to the electronic global slum!
I am one of those despicable people who believe that
IQ not only exists but matters.  From the origin of the
Internet through the mid 1990s, I&#39;d estimate the mean IQ of
Internet users as about 115.  Today it&#39;s probably somewhere
around 100, the mean in Europe and North America.  The difference
you see in the Internet of today from that of ten years ago is what
one standard deviation (15 points) drop in IQ looks like.
But the mean IQ of the <em>world</em> is a tad less than 90
today, and it&#39;s expected to
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/IQ/1950-2050/" target="is_aux">fall to
about 86 by 2050</a>.  So, when the digital divide is conquered
and all ten billion naked apes are wired up, you&#39;re looking at
about <em>another</em> standard deviation&#39;s drop in the IQ of
the Internet.  Just imagine what that will be like.
</p>

<p>
Optimists point to initiatives underway to address the problems of
the Internet: secure operating systems, certificate based
authentication, tools for identifying abusers and legal sanctions
against them, and the like.  But I fear the cure may be worse than the
disease, so much so that I penned a
<a href="https://www.fourmilab.ch/documents/digital-imprimatur/" target="is_aux">25,000 word
screed</a> sketching the transformation of the Internet from an
open network of peers to a locked-down medium for delivering
commercial content to passive consumers.
</p>

<p>
I&#39;m not ready to abandon the Internet, at least not right away.  But I&#39;m
<em>thinking about it</em>, and I suspect I&#39;m not alone.  Those who have
already abandoned it are, by that very choice, neither
publishing Web pages nor posting messages about it; they
are silent, visible only by their absence from the online
community.  Will early adopters of the Internet, who are in the best
position to compare what it is today with what they connected to
years ago, become early opters-out?  Me, I&#39;m keeping an eye on this
trend—it could just be the next big thing.
