    <h1>The Apple-1&#39;s unusual MOS clock driver chip</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-1776539597405547675" itemprop="description articleBody">


<p>Apple&#39;s first product was the Apple-1 computer, introduced in 1976. 
This early microcomputer used an unusual type of storage for its display: shift register memory.
Instead of storing data in RAM (random-access memory), it was stored
in a 1024-position shift register.
You put a bit into the shift register and 1024 clock cycles later, the bit pops out the other end.
Since a shift-register memory didn&#39;t require addressing circuitry, it could be manufactured more cheaply than a random-access
memory chip.<span id="fnref:cost"><a href="#fn:cost">1</a></span>
The downside, of course, is that you had to use bits as they became available, rather than access arbitrary memory locations.
The behavior of shift-register memory was a good match for video circuitry, though, since characters are displayed on the screen
in a fixed, repeating order (left to right and top to bottom).<span id="fnref:delay"><a href="#fn:delay">2</a></span></p>

<p>Shift-register memory chips required clock pulses with high current and unusual voltages: from +5 volts to -11 volts.
These pulses were provided by a special chip, the DS0025 Two-Phase MOS Clock Driver.
This chip, introduced in 1969, was the first monolithic (i.e. integrated circuit) clock driver.
In this blog post, I look inside the chip and explain how it was implemented.</p>

<p>The photo above shows the silicon die under the microscope.
This chip is very simple, containing four large NPN transistors, four diodes, and four resistors.
The silicon appears blue-gray in this image, while the metal layer on top appears speckled white.
Around the outside of the die, are six dark rectangles, the pads where golden bond wires connected the die to the chip&#39;s external pins.</p>
<p>The die was encased in an epoxy package. To expose the die, Eric (<a href="https://twitter.com/TubeTimeUS">@TubeTimeUS</a>)
tediously sanded through the plastic package until the die was visible.
Some bits of epoxy remained, caught in the bond wires, so I cleaned up the die with a few drops of boiling sulfuric acid.</p>
<h2>The Apple-1&#39;s display</h2>
<p>The Apple-1 displayed 24 lines of forty characters on a television monitor.
Like most computers at the time, the Apple-1 stored characters rather than pixels to reduce memory requirements.
A <a href="http://amigan.yatho.com/2513.pdf">character-generation ROM</a> converted each character into a 5×7 matrix of pixels as it was displayed.
To reduce memory even more, the display didn&#39;t store full bytes, but 6-bit characters, supporting upper-case letters, numbers, and
some symbols.</p>
<p>The six-bit display characters were held in six 1024-bit shift registers. A seventh shift register tracked the cursor position.<span id="fnref:display"><a href="#fn:display">3</a></span>
The diagram below shows the shift registers and the clock driver on the Apple-1 circuit board. These chips are in 8-pin packages,
so two chips fit into the space of a regular TTL chip.</p>

<h2>Transistors</h2>
<p>Next, I&#39;ll discuss the components of the chip.
Because the chip generates high-current pulses, it uses large NPN transistors, with a different construction from most integrated circuit transistors.
Each transistor consists of 24 emitters, paralleled in two groups.
(You can consider it one large transistor, 2 transistors, or 24 small transistors.)
The transistor is structured vertically with the collector (made of N-doped silicon) underneath, a thin P-type base in between,
and the N-type emitters embedded in the top, forming the N-P-N layers of the transistor.
The doped silicon regions are faintly visible with black lines around their boundaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/apple-shift-clock/transistor.jpg"><img alt="Half of a transistor, with 12 emitters." height="272" src="https://static.righto.com/images/apple-shift-clock/transistor-w500.jpg" title="Half of a transistor, with 12 emitters." width="500"/></a></p><p>Half of a transistor, with 12 emitters.</p>
<p>In the photo above, you can see the metal wiring for the transistor&#39;s collector, base, and emitter.
The collector wiring is on the outside, with base wiring in between.
The collector and emitter wiring is tapered:
at one end, the wiring needs to support the full current load, while at the other end it only handles 1/12 of the current.
The tapered approach saves space, since it is thicker only where it needs to be thick.</p>
<h2>Resistors</h2>
<p>The resistors are formed from silicon doped to have higher resistance.
The doped silicon rectangle is faintly visible in the die photo. At each end of the resistor, a contact connects the silicon
to the metal layer on top.
The 1000Ω resistor on the left is longer than the 250Ω resistor on the right, giving it more resistance.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/apple-shift-clock/resistors.jpg"><img alt="Two resistors as they appear on the die." height="151" src="https://static.righto.com/images/apple-shift-clock/resistors-w500.jpg" title="Two resistors as they appear on the die." width="500"/></a></p><p>Two resistors as they appear on the die.</p>
<h2>&#34;Tunnels&#34;</h2>
<p>The chip has a single layer of metal wiring, which poses a problem if two signals need to cross.
The solution is to put one signal in the silicon layer so it can pass under the metal layer.
In essence, a low-valued resistor is used to pass under the metal layer.
The image below shows how a tunnel appears on the die.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/apple-shift-clock/underpass.jpg"><img alt="The conductive silicon strip at the top connects the metal regions on either side. The conductive strip at the bottom doesn&#39;t fulfill a wiring need, but ensures that both paths encounter the same resistance." height="387" src="https://static.righto.com/images/apple-shift-clock/underpass-w500.jpg" title="The conductive silicon strip at the top connects the metal regions on either side. The conductive strip at the bottom doesn&#39;t fulfill a wiring need, but ensures that both paths encounter the same resistance." width="500"/></a></p><p>The conductive silicon strip at the top connects the metal regions on either side. The conductive strip at the bottom doesn&#39;t fulfill a wiring need, but ensures that both paths encounter the same resistance.</p>
<p>One problem is that the silicon has relatively high resistance compared to metal, so the tunnel adds resistance. 
The chip is carefully designed so both &#34;sub-transistors&#34; encounter the same resistance, to avoid one transistor turning on before the other.
You can see that the input path in the upper left has a tunnel to pass under the metal wiring, while the path in the lower right has a tunnel of
identical dimensions that doesn&#39;t go under any metal.
While the second tunnel appears pointless, it assures that both paths have the same resistance.</p>
<h2>The chip&#39;s circuit</h2>
<p>The shift register requires a two-phase clock, that is two clock signals in alternation that step the bits through the circuit.
To support this, the clock driver chip has two identical driver circuits.
The schematic below shows one of the circuits.
When the input goes high, it turns on transistor Q1, pulling its collector low. This pulls the output low through diode D2.
When the input drops, Q1 turns off. This lets R2 provide a current to the base of Q2, turning it on, and pulling the output high.
Thus, the circuit is essentially an inverter, but one that can provide up to 1.5 amps of output.<span id="fnref:amps"><a href="#fn:amps">4</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/apple-shift-clock/ds0025-schematic.png"><img alt="Schematic of the DS0025, from the application note." height="284" src="https://static.righto.com/images/apple-shift-clock/ds0025-schematic-w350.png" title="Schematic of the DS0025, from the application note." width="350"/></a></p>
<p>The image below shows the various components of the schematic as they appear on the die.
Most of the chip is occupied by the large power transistors.
Although the chip is mounted in an 8-pin package, only six pins are used; the corresponding pads are labeled below.
The chip consists of two identical mirror-image drivers; one is labeled.
There are a few blackened regions in the transistors; we suspect this is where the chip failed.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This chip provides an interesting view of computer technology in the 1970s.
The Apple-1 used shift-register memory, a technology that rapidly became obsolete as RAM prices dropped.
Shift-register memory required a specialized clock driver integrated circuit, a chip that contained just four large transistors.
With billions of transistors in modern integrated circuits, it&#39;s hard to imagine that it was once worthwhile to build a chip that
was this simple.
The Apple II, introduced just a year later in 1977, used RAM chips for all its storage, making shift-register memory a thing of the past. </p>
