    <h1>Help Locked out of 10 years Gmail account</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Due to the recent LastPass debacle, I decided to cycle my Gmail passwords. Boy that was a mistake!!</p><p>Gmail has decided that I can&#39;t log in with &#34;just&#34; my password. The new password is correct. It then asks me for my old password, which I put in correctly. Then it tells me I can&#39;t log in anyway. :(</p><p>Occasionally it will give me a QR code to scan. But I can&#39;t scan it on my phone, since my phone is logged out.</p><p>I can&#39;t log in to my recovery account, because (like a fool) I changed the passwords simultaneously. Now both are locked.</p><p>Somebody help! My account name is edgeofepsilon@gmail.com (the recovery email should match my HN username). I&#39;m locked out of a decade+ of correspondence, recovery, and historical data.</p></div></div></div>
