<p><a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a> is a very cool markdown driven notetaking app.
It’s a very general purpose note taking app, and can do everything that every
other note taking app can. It is also super extendable, which is really nice —
it is an electron desktop app, so plugins can be literally anything. There are
plugins that add full on react UI components, and plugins that mess with webasm.
Plugins are implemented by hooking onto type declarations that Obsidian
provides, and it all is very well integrated into the app.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/https://static.404wolf.com/Post-20240802183939700.webp" alt="Markdown all the way down"/></p>
<p>The coolest part of Obsidian though, in my opinion, is the fact that all of your
notes live as a hierarchy of
<a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Obsidian+Flavored+Markdown">obsidian flavored markdown</a>
files (which is just a superset of markdown that adds things like highlighting,
comments, and callouts). Obsidian itself is closed source, but I’m okay with
using it anyway since my files are not obfuscated in any way.</p>
<p>A lot of people have extended obsidian with its powerful plugin plugin system,
to let you do more than just take notes. One philosophy that seems to be
catching on is to use Obsidian as a life manager; as an all in one tool.</p>
<h2 id="plugin-ecosystem">Plugin Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Obsidian is <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, so it can do anything a
browser can. It’s implemented very well and you don’t really notice this unless
you try, but if you want to <em>create</em> for Obsidian, the sky is the limit — heck,
<a href="https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Use+React+in+your+plugin">you can create plugins with React</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/Post-20240806165246984.webp" alt="Obsidian full calendar"/></p>
<p>One plugin I’ve started using is
<a href="https://github.com/obsidian-community/obsidian-full-calendar">Obsidian Full Calendar</a>,
which a cool calendar plugin for Obsidian that lets you unidirectionally sync
iCal calendars, and then also manage events within Obsidian, where it can treat
events as markdown files. That means that I can create an event within Obsidian,
and it can create a corresponding event markdown file, that has the actual
metadata for the event in it.</p>
<p>This is a paradigm that I really like — treating usually structured and rigid
data as semi-structured markdown.</p>
<p>I have started to use templates to create other types of “typically <em>structured</em>
dataforms” in unstructured markdown. The nice thing about Obsidian is that this
does <strong>not</strong> mean copying and pasting every single template. Templating in
Obsidian is pretty mature at this point, it comes with a
<a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Templates">built in templating plugin</a>, and
the community has created a much more powerful
<a href="https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater">Templator</a> plugin. You can plug in
everything from the current note’s file name, to the date, to arbitrary
javascript function results.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/Post-20240806170104437.webp" alt="Omnisearch"/></p>
<p>I think one of the coolest Obsidian plugins, that really does totally change the
experience, is <a href="https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch">Omnisearch</a>,
which is a super powerful search engine for your entire note vault. It does
weighted fuzzy finding across all vault contents, and it even OCRs images and
PDFs. What that means is that the search results are always as relevant as
possible — if you search for a file, files with some of that name (it’s fuzzy!)
show up first, followed by notes with titles, and contents. This means that if
all of my life is stored as markdown in my Obsidian vault, then it’s easy to
find things later.</p>
<h2 id="the-dilemma">The dilemma</h2>
<p>Part of this does mean that I’m restarting systems that I’ve had in place for a
really long time. I really like Google Calendar, but I <em>prefer</em> being able to
put whatever I want into <em>semi structured</em> markdown files for events. Part of
switching to this new system means that my old calendar events are not going to
be in my Obsidian vault.</p>
<p>Importing old calendar events is good enough for now, because since the plugin
supports linking iCal I still can view all my old events, I just don’t have the
ability to have corresponding markdown files. I probably could figure out how to
import them that way with some scripting, but that’s not really worth it for me
since those events are in the past and I’m probably not still taking notes on
them.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/Post-20240806171003276.webp" alt="My options"/></p>
<p>One area of my note-taking life that I would like to include in my Obsidian
vault, though, is my contacts. All my contacts before this project were, as was
the case for most people, stored in <a href="https://404wolf.com/posts/obsidiancontactimporter/contacts.google.com">Google Contacts</a>, and
on my phone in the Contacts app.</p>
<p>What I wanted was a system to load my contacts into structured markdown files
(ideally following some sort of template that I could fine tune and specify).
Obsidian has a plugin registry built into the app, which you can contribute to
by just PRing to a repo. It is pretty extensive, but there were really limited
options that showed up. It’s possible there’s some project out there on Github,
since Obsidian plugins get loaded by just plopping a manifest and js bundle into
a specific spot, but I couldn’t find any.</p>
<h2 id="but-also">But also</h2>
<p>But also, I want to get better at remembering people. I encounter a lot of
people on a fairly regular basis, but I think I could do a better job of
remembering what people do, interesting things I talk about with them, and that
sort of thing.</p>
<p>By having all my contacts in raw markdown, I think it will both lower the
barrier to someone being a “contact,” and will allow me to keep better records
of how I know people and track my conversations with them over time.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/Post-20240806171751994.webp" alt="Google Contact export"/></p>
<p>If I assume that all my contacts are in Google contacts (a bold proposition),
then I can export them as a CSV and then use them that way. But that also means
that anyone who uses my tool will also need to be using Google contacts. I guess
I could have asked people to upload their contacts to Google so that they could
then download them as a CSV, but that’s clunky, so I decided to look into how
they exist on the phone itself.</p>
<p>I can’t really know how Apple is storing them on the file system because of how
closed source it is, but one thing I did figure out is that Apple let’s you
export your contacts in a uniquely unintuitive way: press and hold on a contact
“list”, or “all contacts”, and choose to Export (or email every single contact
in your phone! I will not be doing that, though.).</p>

<h3 id="vcards">VCards</h3>
<p>It turns out that the format that gets exported is the <code>vCard</code> format, which is
the same format that gets used when you share contacts: if you text a friend
your contact what you’ve sent them is a <code>vCard</code> file.</p>
<p>vCards are kinda a pain. There’s a proper
<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6350.html">RFC</a> on the spec. It’s a 74 page
PDF.
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/preservation/digital/formats/fdd/fdd000616.shtml">The vCard format was originally developed by Apple, AT&amp;T, IBM, and Siemens.</a>
as a new unified standard for contact storage, but it’s very powerful.</p>
<p>The US library of congress has a section for the format, so I’ll drop in their
description and move on</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Virtual Card Format (vCard) is a versatile data format designed for exchanging
electronic representations of contact information. vCard is commonly referred
to as an
<a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/fmt/395">“electronic business card”</a>
and is fully and openly standardized through IETF
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6350">RFC 6350</a>. The vCard file
<a href="https://docs.fileformat.com/email/vcf/">contains</a> the same type of content
typically found on a physical business card, such as a contact’s name,
address, phone number and email but may also list more personal data such as
birthday or even organizational data such as line of supervision. Being
digital, vCards can contain graphics (including headshots or ID photos),
video, and audio as well as textual data. These files are shared across a wide
variety of communication channels including email, instant messaging, text
messaging, and website embedding. A single vCard file can contain information
for one or more contacts. These digital cards are versatile, extending beyond
personal descriptions to potentially represent various directory objects,
including organizations, departments, or even buildings. However, the
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-internet-email/9780596802585/">predominant use</a>
remains the representation of individuals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s right, you can store arbitrary data in vCards! Pretty cool.</p>
<h2 id="parsing-vcards">Parsing VCards</h2>
<p>So, vCards are plain text that store contact information. Great, that means we
can look at them (and diff them, and all the other fun things that plain text
let’s us do)…</p>
<p>Here’s my vCard</p>

<p>I got it by clicking “share contact,” and then I shared it via email with
myself, and downloaded the email attachment.</p>
<p>It’s pretty gnarly. I mean, it has all I need, but how do I actually yoink out
the relevant pieces of information. Also notice that the image is just a regular
base64 image — that’s pretty nice.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/https://static.404wolf.com/Post-20240806173810683.webp" alt="My options"/></p>
<p>So I looked into it a bit.</p>
<p>It turns out that there’s not a ton of good options. I tried three different
ones before arriving on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/vcf">vcf</a>, and faced a
few issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrong type of vCard. There’s 4 different versions that aren’t fully
compatible.</li>
<li>Commonjs hell. I’m using <a href="https://bun.sh">bun</a>, which makes life so much
easier, (you can import and require in the same file!), but I don’t want to
require. I want a pure esm solution.</li>
<li>Types. I want types. Typescript is a good thing.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/https://static.404wolf.com/Post-20240806174857068.webp" alt="VCF library"/></p>
<p>So, <code>vcf</code> isn’t typed, but it does have type declarations, and works reasonably
well. And, it turns out it’s wicked fast with <code>bun</code>, which is really nice. I
don’t even have to bundle, just running it as a script is fast with <code>bun</code> (but
we’ll bundle later since I do need to package it with nix, since of course we
do).</p>

seems everything that we need is there, but it’s just a pain in the neck to
extract anything.</p>
<p><em>some hours later</em></p>
<p>I decided to move on anyway, and write a wrapper that uses <code>vcf</code> to extract the
necessary pieces of information from the <code>vCard</code> to craft a <code>Contact</code> object.</p>

<p>Much, much better.</p>
<p>Most of the pain was in dealing with how Apple hacks about the <code>vCard</code> spec: for
many of the elements in the parsed response I got, I would find that things like
phone numbers would be labeled with tags like <code>label1</code>, <code>label2</code>, and <code>label3</code>,
corresponding to <code>personal</code>, <code>home</code>, etc, where the mapping would exist
elsewhere in the <code>vCard</code>, but not in one consistent spot.</p>
<p>To solve this, I just created a global hashmap for each <code>vCard</code> that had all of
the label references and their corresponding proper labels…</p>

<p>Now that I have a function that can take a contact and give me a pretty JSON,
I’m just about ready to start generating markdown.</p>
<p>For this, I have a few options, but it was a tricky decision.</p>
<h2 id="creating-markdown">Creating Markdown</h2>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/https://static.404wolf.com/Post-20240806180300351.webp" alt="The template"/></p>
<p>One cool idea I had pretty early on for this project was the ability for the
process to be bidirectional. That is, I thought it’d be pretty neat if you could
take vCard contacts and turn them into markdown, and then eventually go the
other direction: take the markdown you generated, and maybe some hand written
contacts that follow the schema, and create vCards that you can load back into
your phone.</p>
<p>Also, it would be important to parse the generated markdown later on just so
that I could change the template if I ever wanted to. I love configuring things,
and I think it’s pretty likely that I would want to make some changes to the
template down the line, like moving different sections of the contacts to
different spots in the template.</p>
<p>No matter what I did, I’d probably be using
<a href="https://unifiedjs.com/explore/package/remark/">remark</a> to parse the markdown,
which is a plugin for the <code>unified</code> AST ecosystem. It lets you create a
traversable AST from a plaintext markdown file. I was thinking it might be fun
in the future to create my own vCard parser using <code>unified</code> in pure
<code>typescript</code>.</p>
<p>This was a really tough decision, I was brainstorming and devised a few
different options that would be potentially bidirectional</p>
<p>It turns out that markdown allows you to inject something called “frontmatter”,
which is basically a yaml, at the top of your markdown file, surrounded by <code>---</code>
on either side. That is, something like</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext"><code><span><span>---</span></span>
<span><span>foo: &#34;bar&#34;</span></span>
<span><span>tags: foo, bar, buzz</span></span>
<span><span>---</span></span></code></pre>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/https://static.404wolf.com/Post-20240806180922110.webp" alt="Blog post metadata in frontmatter"/></p>
<p>This is something I do for the Obsidian plugin for my website; I embed metadata
about the blog posts at the top of the blog post files.</p>
<p>One idea then, using this, would be to pick a template and stick to it, and
write a parser that can parse it into a specific format. Then I could add
something like “parser-top-use” (in more practicality, probably something like
“version” or “parserid”), and then dynamically parse notes based on the schema
that they are using.</p>
<p>This is a pretty high effort idea, so another idea I was flirting with was
rendering markdown based on the frontmatter. I found a very straightforward
Obsidian plugin that does this called
<a href="https://github.com/sbquinlan/obsidian-handlebars">“Obsidian handlebars”</a>.
<a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> is a javascript library that lets you
compile and then use templates for text files. It’s a templating language and is
pretty good at what it does.</p>
<p>The plugin’s example is something very similar to what I want to do…</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="markdown"><code><span><span>---</span></span>
<span><span>tags:</span></span>
<span><span>  -</span><span> cool</span></span>
<span><span>  -</span><span> awesome</span></span>
<span><span>---</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>\`\`\`</span><span>handlebars tags: {{#each frontmatter.tags}}{{.}}, {{/each}} </span><span>\`\`\`</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately, however, it’s one directional.</p>
<p>I found an Obsidian plugin called
<a href="https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin">“Obsidian meta bind”</a>
that does something like this in a bidirectional way.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.404wolf.com/https://static.404wolf.com/Post-20240806181431211.webp" alt="Obsidain meta bind"/></p>
<p>You can create “inputs” in the markdown template, and then when you edit them
they automatically update the frontmatter, and then when the user edits the
inputs OR the frontmatter it automatically updates the note/frontmatter.</p>
<p>It works pretty good, but it’s fairly janky and requires a lot of boilerplate
that I rather not deal with. It also seems a bit fragile, since it is assuming
that their inputs work properly long term and don’t have any weird plugin
interactions.</p>
<p>Another idea that I had was to very simply just create a vCard viewer/editor for
Obsidian. I’ve wanted to learn <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelt</a> for a while, so I
might still do this eventually, but for now, I decided on a simpler solution.</p>
<h2 id="obsidian-tables">Obsidian Tables</h2>
<p>Obsidian tables are pretty good for storing tabulated data, and they are very
human readable. It’s an accessible format, and remark/unified should be able to
parse it easily.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="markdown"><code><span><span>| This is a header | This is another header |</span></span>
<span><span>| ---------------- | ---------------------- |</span></span>
<span><span>| This is a value  | This is another value  |</span></span></code></pre>
<p>I decided to go with storing the contact data in tables for now, since it’ll be
easy to parse them later on. To figure out which sections are which, for now
I’ll just have headings above the tables that say what is in them, that I can
regex against when parsing. It is a bit restrictive to require that people
structure their contact templates with markdown tables, but it’s better than
zero flexability, and it will let me figure out a better solution later on.</p>
<p>The example template that I came up with, which is very table driven to store
the key-value pairs, is this.</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="markdown"><code><span><span>---</span></span>
<span><span>obsidian-contact-importer-schema-version: &#39;1.0&#39;</span></span>

<p>And it works! So now let’s package it and call it a day.</p>
<h2 id="bun--nix">Bun + Nix</h2>
<p>I’m not going to go too deep into Nix here, but the TLDR is that it’s a
programming langauge and utility library that makes it very easy to create
extremely pure and consistent, builds of arbitrary files, including executable.</p>
<p>The catch with <code>nix</code> is that it doesn’t just try to be pure, it <strong>forces</strong>
purity. Purity is, in this context, that whenever you run a build, the output
artifact will be bit for bit identical given the same inputs. This makes it
annoying to package things some times, since the <code>sandbox</code> that <code>nix</code> builds
happen in is very restrictive — it doesn’t have internet!</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of utility builder functions that are able to prefetch all your
dependencies. A common one is <code>buildNpmPackage</code>, which is <em>de facto</em> standard
for <code>nixpkgs</code> packages (packages on the official registry) that are in <code>ts/js</code>.
I’m using <code>bun</code> though, not <code>npm</code> or <code>node</code>.</p>
<p>Prefetching artifacts for builds is done by specifying the hash of the thing
you’re fetching, so that you can guarantee that the things you’re fetching are
what you think they are. This isn’t that bad when you have a <code>package-lock.json</code>
with <code>npm</code> or even with <code>yarn</code>. In that case all of the hashes already live
there, and can be used to safely do the fetches.</p>
<p>But, in this case, I want to use <code>nix</code> to package a <code>bun</code> app. <code>bun</code> presents a
few challenges; namely, it uses a
<a href="https://bun.sh/docs/install/lockfile">special binary lock file format</a> that’s
super fast and efficient, but isn’t easily parseable. You can use <code>bun</code> to read
it as a <code>yarn</code> lock file, and theoretically you could go down that route to do
prefetching of deps, but I decided on a much easier approach:
<code>fixed-point-derivations.</code></p>
<p><a href="https://bmcgee.ie/posts/2023/02/nix-what-are-fixed-output-derivations-and-why-use-them/">Fixed point derivations</a>
are when you ALLOW internet access in the sandbox during the build. This sounds
scary, and like a bad idea. It kinda is. The catch is that you specify the hash
of the output before doing the build. If the build, using the internet during
the build, results in an output with the same hash that you pre-specified, then
the build succeeds an it’s fine, but otherwise the build fails and you get
nothing. In the case of <code>bun</code> though, this isn’t that bad, since <code>bun</code> is very
good at getting very consistent dependencies using its lock file. So it’s
probably good enough for now.</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like in action, as a DIY nix builder utility function…</p>

<p>Which just runs bun on the output file. Javascript isn’t “compiled”, so this is
the best we’re going to get. What this does do though is create a nice bundle,
and makes the build nicely portable. It also means that anyone with nix can
instantly run the project with a single CLI command (see the next section)!</p>

<p>Clone <a href="https://github.com/404wolf/obsidian-contact-importer">this</a> repo, or
create a <code>inputs</code> folder with a <code>vcards.vcf</code> and <code>template.md</code> file (see example
template if you’re creating your own).</p>
<p>Run <code>nix run github:404wolf/obsidian-contact-importer</code> if you have <code>nix</code>. If
not, make sure that <code>bun</code> is installed, and then run <code>bun install</code>. Export your
contacts to a <code>.vcf</code> format, and then just run <code>bun run dev</code>.</p>

<p>Another super cool Obsidian plugin, so cool that it’s even baked into the
program, is “<a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes">Daily Notes</a>”. Daily
notes are exactly what they sound like — Obsidian automatically creates a new
note every day that you can dump information into, and by virtue of the
structure they get sorted by date. I find it really useful for very quickly
jotting things down, and since they’re in my vault they’re nicely searchable.</p>
<p>A big inspiration for the project is making it easier to take notes on people,
so the ability to make people reference-able in my vault with a single hotkey
would rapidly reduce the friction needed to begin taking notes on a person.
Since I’m used to pinging people on apps like Slack, Zulip, Discord, etc, I
thought it’d be handy if I could just @ my contacts in my vault.</p>
<p>Enter

<h2 id="fixing--symbol-linking">Fixing <a href="https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-at-symbol-linking">@ Symbol Linking</a></h2>
<p>An important part of Obsidian is the ability to easily link together your notes.
Obsidian lets you reference any note in your vault by using <code>[[Note Title]]</code>,
and it creates a clickable link. You can add a ! to cause the reference to
actually show its contents in the current note.</p>

<p>@ Symbol linking wasn’t actually the first plugin I found for this purpose,
though. I started off using
<a href="https://github.com/saibotsivad/obsidian-at-people">Obsidian at people</a>, which
claims to do literally exactly what I want. Unfortunately, even though there’s a
setting for it, all of the people notes you create with it end up in the top
level directory of your Obsidian vault, when I want them to end up in a
<code>/People</code> folder.</p>
<p>@ Symbol linking is a pretty straightforward plugin that does the same thing.
It’s a bit more generalized — you can use other symbols as prefixes besides @,
and you can customize a few more options.</p>
<p>One thing that I did like that <code>Obsidian at people</code> did was prefixing all of my
people notes with ”@”, though, which makes it really clear which notes are
“People” notes. This was a feature lacking in @ Symbol linking so
I<a href="https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-at-symbol-linking/pull/34">decided to implement it myself and PR the change</a>.</p>

<p>Their plugin was written pretty well, though more comments and docs would’ve
been nice. It mostly boiled down to adding</p>
<pre tabindex="0" data-language="typescript"><code><span><span>if</span><span> (settings.keepTriggerSymbol)</span></span>
<span><span>  filePath </span><span>=</span><span> value.obj?.filePath.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span></span>
<span><span>    /(</span><span>[</span><span>^</span><span>/]</span><span>+</span><span>)</span><span>$</span><span>/</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    `${</span><span>settings</span><span>.</span><span>triggerSymbol</span><span>}$1`</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>  )</span></span>
<span><span>else</span><span> filePath </span><span>=</span><span> value.obj?.filePath</span></span></code></pre>
<p>And the relevant setting. To polish things off, I also updated the “Create new
note” suggestion to suggest the name with the @ symbol if the setting was
enabled.</p>

<p>To make the templates look nicer, I decided to use a plugin I already was using
in my vault for my contacts too.
<a href="https://github.com/scottTomaszewski/obsidian-inline-admonitions">Obsidian inline admonitions</a>
lets you change the way that your inline code (` &lt;this type of thing&gt; `)
renders so that it can have a nice color and even be slightly translucent. I
decided to change the template slightly to incorporate these.</p>

<h2 id="big-things">Big things</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bidirectionality! I want to be able to take my note files that contain VCard
data and then bring the markdown back into VCard format.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="smaller-things">Smaller things</h2>
<ul>
<li>VCards are a massive spec. I don’t implement nearly close to all of the
possible things that they could. I want to implement some more things though,
like pronouns and nicknames.</li>
<li>That is tested with Apple contacts so far. I want to test to see if this works
with Google/other flavors of contacts too.</li>
