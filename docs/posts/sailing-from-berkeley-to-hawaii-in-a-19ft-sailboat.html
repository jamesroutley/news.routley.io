    <h1>Sailing from Berkeley to Hawaii in a 19ft Sailboat</h1>

<h2>By Bill Teplow</h2>

<h2>From Dream to Plan</h2>
<p>As a consulting exploration geologist, my work life tends to consist of periods 
  of intense work punctuated by periods of intense unemployment. True to form, 
  I completed my last work assignment on July 8th and I found myself with a month 
  and a half of enforced leisure before my next gig. Since the coming job was 
  located on the Big Island of Hawaii, an old fantasy of mine started to materialize 
  as an actual plan. In early July, while looking at my West Wight Potter 19 &#34;Chubby&#34; 
  sitting jauntily at her berth at the Berkeley Marina, tugging at her dock lines 
  and proudly showing off her new bottom paint, it dawned on me that I could use 
  her to commute to my next job. On July 9th I started serious preparations for 
  the trip.</p>
<p>Just as I was getting heavily into the outfitting, my client on the Big Island 
  called and asked me to show up on July 16th at a coordinating meeting for the 
  project startup. I flew over to Hilo a day early and went straight to Radio 
  Bay, the small boat harbor located in the far eastern corner of Hilo Bay, tucked 
  in behind the big commercial docks. I chatted with the very friendly and accommodating 
  Harbor Master&#39;s staff and got all the information needed for proper check-in 
  and for renting a space at the harbor. I also got a chance to see the particular 
  style of anchoring and stern tie that is used at the 10&#39; high cement sea wall. 
  The daily fee for keeping Chubby at Radio Bay is $8.50. There is a 30 day limit 
  that can be extended if there is room. When I arrived four weeks later in Chubby, 
  there were two boats tied up, leaving room for perhaps 15 more, so space was 
  not an issue. There is a locked restroom with shower at the dock for the exclusive 
  use of cruisers, and a market and laundromat one block away. The friendly atmosphere 
  and secure tie-up for my destination port gave me the final push to commit to 
  the voyage.</p>
<p>Upon return home to Oakland I found myself with four days to make the final 
  preparations for the trip. I had committed myself to a July 21 departure which 
  was the latest possible date that would assure my arrival in Hilo prior to start 
  of work. Also that date had a mild afternoon ebb to aid my escape. With such 
  a short period of time to prepare the boat, things got pretty hectic. But when 
  it came time to push back from the dock, Chubby was pretty well prepared and 
  upon arriving in Hilo, I was still of the same opinion.</p>
<h2>To Reality</h2>
<p>The following is a discussion of the technical aspects of preparing Chubby 
  and sailing her from Berkeley, California to Hilo, Hawaii. The actual distance 
  sailed was 2142 nautical miles and the voyage took 24 days, almost to the minute, 
  to complete. The voyage in general went very smoothly with no major mishaps. 
  I arrived in Hilo feeling fit, rested and happy. For those who enjoy reading 
  about ordeals at sea, I am sorry to disappoint. Nothing that was supplied by 
  International Marine, the Potter manufacturer, broke during the voyage. Chubby 
  generally behaved quite well in the open ocean and the trade winds even though 
  she is designed to be a trailer sailer and coastal pocket cruiser. I want to 
  stress that I do not want this article or my generally pleasant experience in 
  sailing Chubby to Hawaii to be construed as an endorsement for using the Potter 
  19 as a blue water cruiser. It was designed to be a safe and competent trailerable 
  coastal pocket cruiser and it fulfills its stated goals admirably.</p>
<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>Of the modifications I made to the otherwise stock Potter 19, most were aimed 
  at increasing the margin of safety for this already safe and stable design. 
  In order to increase the rate of drainage of the cockpit in case Chubby was 
  pooped, I added two additional 1-1/4&#34; diameter cockpit drains located just 
  above the cockpit floor at the base of the transom. I also raised the overall 
  freeboard of the cabin by installing a hinged and latched lower companionway 
  door. Weather stripping for the door made a water-tight seal. This increased 
  the cabin freeboard by about 8&#34; and raised it above the height of the transom. 
  Theoretically this would allow the clearing of water from the cockpit while 
  preventing significant volumes of water from spilling into the cabin. </p>
<p>I installed two types of jack lines. I ran a conventional nylon webbing jackline 
  around the perimeter of boat and anchored them through the fore and aft pairs 
  of deck cleats. The jackline was used as an anchor for my tether and harness. 
  The perimeter arrangement allowed me to clip into the jackline in the cockpit 
  and then go to the foredeck for headsail changes in my usual manner which was 
  to swing outboard of the shrouds. If I got bucked off the foredeck, I would 
  theoretically slide along the jackline to the stern and would be able to climb 
  aboard the boat using the swim ladder. A critical extra bit of safety equipment 
  for this jackline system was the tiller pilot trip line. It appeared to me that 
  if Chubby was gurgling along at 5 kts and I was being towed at the end of my 
  tether, it might be very difficult to pull myself up to the swim ladder against 
  the flow, even if the distance was only the 5 or 6 foot length of the tether. 
  I therefore rigged a small block attached to the tiller just above the tiller 
  pilot armature. I then ran a 3/16&#34; line from the armature, through the 
  block and over the transom. The line trailed astern to a distance of about 8 
  feet. A light tug on the line would release the tiller pilot and allow Chubby 
  to round up and stop, giving me time to grab the swim ladder and get on board. 
  The system remains untested. Incidentally, I wore the harness and tether at 
  all times while in the cockpit and on the foredeck. This was one of two of my 
  wife Naomi&#39;s conditions for allowing me to take the voyage. The other condition 
  was to carry an EPIRB.</p>
<p>I ran two additional jacklines which were specifically for securing cargo. 
  These jacklines were made of 1/8&#34; 7X19 stainless cable. One was run around 
  the inside perimeter of the cabin sole and was secured to the storage compartment 
  walls with through-bolted U-bolts using backing plates. The heaviest cargo loads 
  including the generator, water bottles and inflatable kayak were secured to 
  the cabin sole by means of the interior jackline using heavy-duty nylon webbing 
  and cam locks. The webbing which passed over the top of the keel served as a 
  backup to the factory installed keel hold-down fittings which keep the keel 
  in place in the event of capsize. The hatches for the storage compartments were 
  also secured to the interior jackline to prevent scattering of the cabinet contents 
  in the event of a knockdown or roll. </p>
<p>All the canned goods were stored in plastic tubs in the storage compartments. 
  They were secured to the bottom of the hull by wedging empty water bottles and 
  extra life jackets in the space between the tubs and the top of the storage 
  bins. The resulting stowage and tie-down system assured that even if Chubby 
  turned turtle, all the objects of significant weight stowed inside the cabin 
  could not be dislodged from their proper location. </p>
<p>A similar cable jackline was installed around the perimeter of the cockpit 
  sole. This was used to secure the tanks for the outboard and generator fuel. 
  All the fuel was stored in the cockpit so that any spillage could be drained 
  and would not fill the cabin with fumes. </p>
<p>Chubby&#39;s flotation capacity was enhanced to compensate for the added load. 
  This was done as mentioned above by stuffing the void spaces in the storage 
  bins with empty one-gallon water bottles. I also carried inflatable flotation 
  bags with several hundred pounds of buoyancy and a large capacity air pump so 
  that they could be filled in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>For extreme emergency situations I carried an EPIRB with built-in GPS and a 
  complete suite of handheld flares and a flare gun. I also carried two handheld 
  VHF radios in addition to the fixed 25-watt unit. Rounding out the safety equipment 
  was an offshore type first aid kit.</p>
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<p>My primary navigation tool was a Garmin 12XL handheld GPS. I had an identical 
  unit in reserve, stored in a waterproof container. Also, I carried a Garmin 
  76 which served in lieu of a printed light list. All three units were programmed 
  prior to departure with the Jimmy Cornell route discussed later on and a few 
  critical waypoints for the departure from the Golden Gate and for the approach 
  to Hilo Bay. I kept a paper chart of the entire voyage on which was plotted 
  each noon position. I made a portable nav station for the paper maps by sandwiching 
  them between two pieces of 20&#34;X24&#34; Plexiglas.</p>
<p>I also took a sextant, and during the initial calm periods that plagued the 
  first half of the voyage, I learned and practiced celestial navigation. By the 
  time I got to the trade winds, I was able to get a decent position using sun 
  sights. In the trade winds the sights were much more difficult because of Chubby&#39;s 
  sharp motion caused by the short, steep following seas. However, even then I 
  was able to get sufficient accuracy of +/- 2 to 3 miles, which was plenty good 
  enough to hit the Big Island from 1000 miles out.</p>
<h2>Electrical</h2>
<p>Chubby&#39;s electrical system was powered by two group 24 12V batteries which 
  were original equipment when I bought the boat. The batteries were used primarily 
  to power the tiller pilot. The batteries were charged for about 1 hour daily 
  using a Honda EU 1000 gasoline generator coupled with a 3-stage battery charger. 
  The generator burned 1-1/2 gallons of gas in 24 days. I had started with a total 
  4 gallons of gas reserved for the generator. Other than the tiller pilot, there 
  were no significant electrical loads placed on the batteries. There was no backup 
  power source for charging the batteries.</p>
<h2>Electronics</h2>
<p>Electronics consisted of a 25-watt VHF radio with a cabin mounted antenna. 
  Two contacts were made with passing ships using the VHF, one on day 10 and one 
  on day 21. In each case I was able to have a fax sent to Naomi with my position, 
  condition, and my ETA in Hilo. I also carried a short wave receiver with SSB 
  capability but did not have much luck receiving any meaningful broadcasts. Wind 
  speed was measured using a handheld wind meter.</p>
<h2>Provisioning</h2>
<p>I took 40 days worth of food and water. Generally I relied on canned goods 
  to supply the bulk of my meals. Each can was protected in double Ziplock bags 
  to prevent rusting. Pinhole leaks in cans caused by rust and corrosion can be 
  lethal to the unsuspecting mariner. I used a small camp stove to heat the canned 
  meals. The stove I used was suspended from the cabin ceiling by 4 light cables. 
  Pots were locked onto the stove using the suspension cables and a sliding sleeve. 
  In a addition to the normal stews and chillis, I brought a lot of ready-to-eat 
  stuff like peanut butter, crackers, roasted almonds and energy bars. This was 
  kept readily within reach so I would have a rich source of calories during periods 
  of high wind and waves that might prevent me from cooking. That particular scenario 
  never developed during the trip. Even in 16-18 kt trade winds, I was easily 
  able to prepare hot meals.</p>
<p>I also brought considerable fresh food including apples, peaches, bananas, 
  bread, cheese, and olives. The bread and cheese lasted two weeks, the apples 
  lasted 20 days and the olives stayed good for the duration.</p>
<p>I started the voyage with 26 gallons of water and arrived in Hilo with 12 gallons 
  remaining. That works out to a consumption rate of a little over 2 quarts of 
  water per day. In actuality, I drank desalinated water during two days of calm 
  so my per-day consumption of bottled water was closer to 3 quarts per day. I 
  carried a PUR Survivor 35 reverse osmosis, hand-pumped water maker. I was able 
  to make a gallon of drinking water in 45 minutes. I drank the heinous stuff 
  when becalmed because I felt uncomfortable consuming my bottled water when we 
  were not making any progress. The bottled water was purchased in square shaped 
  1-gallon plastic bottles. This shape has the advantage of packing tightly and 
  not rolling with the motion of the boat. Also, the carrying handles on each 
  bottle facilitate tying the bottles down to the cabin sole. It is possible to 
  pack 15 one-gallon bottles into the space between the cabin sole and the cockpit 
  sole just aft of the companionway. </p>
<p>The total weight of consumables was probably around 320 pounds. Of that, 216 
  pounds was water and the remainder canned and dry foods. With 40 days of food 
  and water, Chubby was far from overloaded. She felt lively and easily achieved 
  hull speed in any wind over 12 kts even the first day when carrying her full 
  load.</p>
<h2>Spare Parts, Miscellaneous Equipment and Tools</h2>
<p>I carried the following spare parts, tools and other odds and ends:</p>
<h2>Routing and Weather</h2>
<p>Starting a week before the planned departure, I checked the weather maps two 
  or three times a day. Fortunately, the Pacific Cup race was being run during 
  the week prior to my departure and the race website gave very valuable information 
  about the routes and relative wind strengths. The early starters in the race 
  were running at or near record paces which indicated that the normal wind patterns 
  were well-established. </p>
<p>It appeared to my novice weather eye that the East Pacific High was poorly 
  formed in June and early July, but further into July the classic summer wind 
  pattern emerged and the early starting Pacific Cup racers made good use of it. 
  Based on the return of the normal winds, I chose the standard route as described 
  in Jimmy Cornell&#39;s World Cruising Routes and programmed that route into my GPS.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, two days before my departure, the West Coast weather pattern 
  deteriorated with the westward migration of a low pressure system which is normally 
  parked over the Nevada desert during the summer months. This low herniated westward 
  and established itself just off the coast stretching from Santa Barbara to San 
  Francisco. It brought with it light and variable southwesterlies. In other words, 
  for the first three days of the voyage after leaving the Golden Gate, I had 
  light winds on the nose or no wind at all. The NOAA weather reports promised 
  that the low pressure would dissipate by the July 24, three days after my departure. 
  In the meantime I found myself either beating toward Hilo or mired in glassy 
  flat calms. My strategy at this point was to tack WNW and look for the normal 
  northwesterlies farther off the coast. This was a departure from my original 
  plan of taking a southerly course for the first three days in lieu of a shakedown 
  cruise. </p>
<p>The planned shakedown which was to take place a week before my departure to 
  Hawaii, had to be scrapped because of various work commitments. I was left with 
  only a week to prepare and provision the boat but no time to do an offshore 
  shakedown. Taking the southerly line would have allowed me to return to any 
  number of Southern California ports on a beam reach in the event that I did 
  not like the way Chubby or her skipper were behaving after three to five days 
  at sea. After three days of foul wind or no wind, I was well to the north of 
  the Jimmy Cornell route. But finally the northeawesterlies started to fill in 
  and I was able to ease the sheets and make some southing. During day 5 Chubby 
  ran off 139 nm bearing SSW which put us within 15 miles of the original planned 
  route. At that point I committed mentally to Hilo as my final destination even 
  though I still had 2 days of sailing before I passed my original point of no 
  return. Beyond the point of no return, which I defined for myself as 30 N, 130 
  W, I would have had to cross the main hurricane corridor out of Mexico in order 
  to reach Turtle Bay or Cabo San Lucas and I did not consider that a feasible 
  option. Five days later, my assumption proved to be very correct as the benign 
  remnants of Hurricane Elida crossed my outbound path precisely at that location. 
  Had I diverted southeastward at day 5, I might have run into 30 or 40 kt winds 
  from the death throes of Elida, which on July 24 was a very proud category 5 
  hurricane with 140 kt winds about 1000 miles to the southeast.</p>
<p>My first hint of a possible hurricane came on day 8 when I found myself becalmed 
  for 12 hours in an area where the pilot charts shows a 2% probability of calms. 
  This was followed by a rapidly dropping barometer from 1016 to 1011 in one night 
  and a cross swell coming out of the SE. This swell combining with the normal 
  swell from the north produced a very uncomfortable, confused sea. On day 10 
  I hailed the tanker Selendang Ratna out of Manzanillo, Mexico bound for Korea. 
  The officer of the watch asked me if I had been hit by the hurricane. My reply 
  was &#34;What hurricane?&#34; He gave me the last plotted position of Elida, 
  her course and speed. The officer complained about getting hammered by high 
  seas and winds a couple of days earlier. After hearing that and plotting the 
  last position of Elida, I stopped complaining to myself about the calms I was 
  encountering. The officer of the watch was able to send a fax for me to Naomi, 
  in which I gave my ETA in Hilo as 15 days hence. That turned out to be a pretty 
  good guess because ultimately I arrived in Hilo from that position in 14 days. 
</p>
<p>As far as heavy weather is concerned, Chubby was never challenged. Aside from 
  the 25 kts. which Chubby beat through to exit the Gate, no winds over 20 kts 
  were encountered during the entire voyage. The trade winds averaged 12-16 knots 
  (Force 4) just as advertised on the Pilot Chart for August. Seas averaged 4-8 
  feet with abundant whitecaps. The trade wind swell tended to be relatively steep 
  with a short wave length. The wave pattern almost always consisted of two wave 
  trains, a dominant one coming from the NE and a smaller one caused by the local 
  squall winds that came out of the east. This crossing pattern produced a relatively 
  sharp and chaotic motion for Chubby. The steep quartering sea tended to tip 
  Chubby back to windward just as the crest of each wave passed. This tipping 
  resulted in a stiff bounding of the flat rear quarter. This was probably the 
  most uncomfortable of Chubby&#39;s open ocean hull characteristics. On the other 
  hand, once Chubby left the Golden Gate, she never took any significant spray 
  into the cockpit in the remaining 2100 miles of sailing. My clothes, the cabin, 
  its contents, and I arrived completely dry in Hilo which was a welcome departure 
  from the soggy mess that I imagined the voyage might be. Clearly my imagination 
  was traumatized by three wet, cold years of sailing in the Slot.</p>
<p>The final weather insult came at a distance of 12 miles outside Hilo Bay. At 
  that point just before dawn, the trade winds quit and a land breeze sprung up 
  at 12 kts on the nose coming right up the rhumbline. That, combined with a strong 
  current setting Chubby north along the Hamakua Coast, meant that after 2135 
  miles of sailing and with the safe harbor in sight, we were starting to lose 
  ground. By then I had contacted Naomi by cell phone and found out that, instead 
  of being at home, she was waiting for me in Hilo. Armed with the happy news, 
  I did not hesitate to mix up a batch of two stroke gas using the gas reserved 
  for the generator. I topped off the outboard tank and started bashing into the 
  chop at full throttle. The wind waves from the land breeze were coming out directly 
  opposed to the incoming trade wind swell, thereby creating a nasty standing 
  chop. Powering in against the chop, wind and foul current, I could only make 
  3.5 knots until we got inside the breakwater. Within three hours though, I was 
  standing on the dock holding Naomi in my arms, or more correctly she was holding 
  me up, while my wobbly sea legs tried to get accustomed to the concrete.</p>
<h2>Performance, Sails and Self Steering</h2>
<p>When there was any kind of steady wind at 8 kts or higher, anywhere beyond 
  60 degrees off the bow, Chubby would easily do over 100 miles a day. Her two 
  best days were 139 and 122 nm and she ran off a total of 13 days of over 100 
  nm out of the 24-day voyage. Dead calms made up 94 hours or nearly four days 
  of the voyage. All speeds and distances run were enhanced by the constant 0.5 
  kt current that runs right down the rhumbline to Hilo. Two boats out of San 
  Francisco Bay, a Columbia 8.7m Alchemy and an Islander 28 Kiss, had preceded 
  Chubby to Radio Bay by a few days. Their passage times were 19 and 20 days respectively. 
  Chubby, with her 16&#39; water line, had nothing to be ashamed about for her 24 
  day passage. </p>
<p>I ran two basic sail configurations for the downwind portions of the voyage. 
  Initially in the lighter trade winds, especially in the absence of squalls, 
  I ran a pair of jibs or genoas, wing and wing, hanked onto the forestay and 
  poled out. With the pair of winged-out genoas Chubby would make 2-3 kts in barely 
  perceptible zephyrs. This configuration salvaged a few miles out of otherwise 
  abysmal light-air days. Rigging the two headsails was accomplished by using 
  a short pendant at the tack of one headsail to create an offset between the 
  pairs of hanks. The two heads were joined with about 8&#34; of ¼&#34; 
  line. The jib halyard was shackled to this line which served to evenly luff 
  tension in both headsails. I ran a preventer on both whisker poles when running 
  the genoas because if one went aback, it would break the whisker pole fitting 
  mounted on the mast. The smaller jibs did not require the preventers when winged 
  out. The advantage of the winged-out jib configuration is that it tended to 
  track straighter going dead down wind and therefore it put a minimum stress 
  on the tiller pilot.</p>
<p>I used the more conventional dead-down setup of poled-out jib and prevented 
  mainsail in the latter part of the trade wind segment. Due to squall activity 
  and the accompanying wind shifts, I found it more convenient with this setup 
  to go from dead run with the whisker pole to a broad reach without having to 
  remove one of the head sails. The winds accompanying the squalls would generally 
  clock about 20 degrees from northeasterly to easterly. These shifts most often 
  happened at night and four or five sail adjustments were not uncommon in any 
  given night.</p>
<p>One great advantage of the Potter 19 is that most sail adjustments and reefing 
  can be made without leaving the cabin. On a typical squall-induced wind shift, 
  I would literally standup in my bed, remove the whisker pole, sheet in the jib 
  on broad reach, reef the main, lean out and adjust the autopilot and go back 
  to sleep without ever taking off the wool socks I wore while sleeping. All of 
  the above could be accomplished in about 2 minutes. If I were lazy in the middle 
  of the night or was involved in a particularly vivid dream when the squalls 
  came up, I would simply drop and furl the main, and continue to make 4 kts on 
  the jib alone and get back to sleep in a minute or so.</p>
<p>The trick in using the tiller pilot is to reef down the main and balance it 
  with the appropriate jib. This would minimize the demands on the tiller pilot 
  and hence on electrical consumption. This cost a little raw boat speed but resulted 
  in a straighter course and fewer roundups which somewhat compensated. With a 
  quartering sea, Chubby would tend to round-up occasionally, typically once or 
  twice an hour. In only one case was the autopilot unable to recover the roundup 
  on its own. Normally in a roundup, the poled-out jib would go aback and force 
  the bow back down wind, thereby aiding the tiller pilot to recover. The Raytheon 
  ST 2000 tiller pilot performed flawlessly throughout the 24 day voyage, just 
  as it had during the entire previous year of sailing on San Francisco Bay. </p>
<p>I used a custom made mainsail from Pineapple Sails in Oakland. The sail was 
  cut flatter than the stock sail in order to better accommodate the relatively 
  stiff winds of San Francisco. Also, the sail had three reef points, two that 
  were identical to the stock main, and one very deep reef that reduces the main 
  to near storm-trysail size. I used the third reef occasionally during the trip 
  with winds above 18 kts because it seemed to balance the #2 jib better than 
  the much larger second reef. </p>
<p>Because of the anomalous wind patterns during the first half of the voyage, 
  Chubby found herself hard on the wind on many occasions. This brought out one 
  of Chubby&#39;s weaknesses in that she would not tack through less than about 110 
  degrees. This characteristic was discussed by Bill Combs in a very interesting 
  and entertaining account of his trip from Florida to the Bahamas. I am conjecturing 
  that this is due to the slab shape of the keel. The slab shape probably loses 
  lift and stalls out at a greater angle of attack than a typical faired fixed 
  keel. This accounts for the generous leeway that the Potter 19 experiences and 
  is probably inherent in any retractable keel boat design.</p>
<p>Another observation that I shared with Bill Combs was how comfortable the boat 
  was when loaded with water and food, all stowed and tied down on the cabin sole. 
  This enhanced ballast made Chubby very stiff and relatively smooth riding, particularly 
  in the 25-kt breeze on the nose we encountered while beating out to the Golden 
  Gate.</p>
<p>Though I never had occasion to practice any heavy weather tactics, I did notice 
  one characteristic of Chubby that might indicate her capability of running off 
  before a gale while trailing warps. Occasionally during sail changes, Chubby 
  would find herself under bare poles for a few moments. With the autopilot set 
  for running dead down wind, Chubby seemed to run a very straight course with 
  the following sea square on the stern. She&#39;d make 1-1/2 to 2 kts in 16 to 18 
  kts of wind in this configuration. I am conjecturing based on this experience 
  that she might do passably well in a gale sailing directly down wind while trailing 
  warps and running the tiller pilot. This remains to be tested. Chubby also heaves-to 
  very easily and I did this several times during the voyage either to make repairs 
  or take in a reef in a fresh breeze.</p>
<h2>Sleep</h2>
<p>I slept primarily at night. I seemed to naturally wake up about once every 
  hour at which time I&#39;d check the wind direction, boat speed, course, and scan 
  the horizon for traffic. I slept athwartship between the two cabin seats. The 
  center portion of the cabin between the two seats was filled in with the inflatable 
  kayak and extra life jackets arranged to make a passable bed. I avoided using 
  the V-berths because it is awkward and slow getting out of the V-berth in the 
  event that I had to get out into the cockpit in a hurry. The advantage of the 
  sleeping in the aft part of the cabin as I did, is that I could instantly access 
  all the control lines just by standing up in my bed. Also, I could check the 
  wind vane by simply sliding back the hatch cover and looking straight up from 
  where I lay. I arrived feeling reasonably well rested and never felt that I 
  was suffering from sleep deprivation. </p>
<p>In the shipping lanes and in the final hours of the voyage as I neared Hilo, 
  I used a kitchen timer to wake myself up at 30 minute intervals so I could give 
  a quick horizon scan.</p>

<h2>Clothing</h2>
<p>During the first 10 days of the trip, temperatures were cool, generally in 
  the the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s (F). For this segment I wore heavy fleece pants and shirt 
  and my foulies. This combination was very warm. At night I would add wool socks 
  and sea boots if I had to exit the cabin to make sail adjustments, particularly 
  on the foredeck. For sleeping during the cool weather, I would cover myself 
  with light sleeping bag. The need to be able to exit the cabin quickly at night 
  to tend to the sails precluded the option of actually crawling into a zipped 
  sleeping bag. South of latitude 30 N, I was generally in shorts and long-sleeved 
  shirt during the day and would sleep in the fleece at night. I always wore a 
  broad brimmed hat during the day and used sun block so I never suffered any 
  sunburn. </p>
<h2>Loose Ends</h2>
<p>As I explained to my neighbors who were expecting twins after years of discussion 
  and deliberation, leaving on a voyage is like deciding to have a baby. If you 
  wait until you are 100% ready, it will never happen. Therefore, there are always 
  a few loose ends remaining when one pushes away from the dock. Half way through 
  my voyage, and of course unbeknownst to me, my neighbors gave birth to twins. 
  And true to my assertion, none of us were completely ready to embark on our 
  respective adventures. In my case the loose ends can be listed as follows:</p>
<p>1. I did not check the condition of the two batteries that provided power for 
  the tiller pilot. I was still using the same batteries supplied originally by 
  International Marine but after 3-1/2 years, they were near the end of their 
  usable life. By the time I got to Hilo, they were reluctant to take a full charge. 
  If the voyage had lasted another few days, I might have been doing a lot of 
  hand steering.</p>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>I would like to express my deep appreciation to Jerry Barrilleaux for all the 
  patience, time and sage advice he gave to me on the phone helping me to configure 
  my Potter 19 prior to placing the order. Jerry made his final adjustments to 
  my boat just three months before my departure to Hilo. I met up with him in 
  Ayala Cove and he noticed that my mainsheet was rigged incorrectly. He quickly 
  remedied the problem, thus fixing a problem I was unaware of for the past three 
  years. </p>
<p>A big thanks to Bruce Chase, the shop manager at <a href="http://www.wwpotter.com">International 
  Marine</a>. Bruce was very generous in his support of my project though he had 
  no idea what it was all about until after I left. He was able to supply me with 
  several key items including two genoas on very short notice.</p>
<p>A special thanks to Joseph Oster of <a href="http://www.wingo.com">Wingo.com</a>, 
  Naomi&#39;s website designer and blue water sailor, who very generously created 
  a link on his website to provide updates about my voyage. He gave much appreciated 
  moral support and information to Naomi and friends regarding the progress of 
  my voyage. He also notified the Potter Yachters and Latitude 38 regarding the 
  voyage, all on his own initiative. </p>
<p>Many thanks to Pamela Johnson, my sailing buddy for many a voyage on and outside 
  the Bay, for her skilled hand in helping to prep the boat and for photographing 
  my departure from the Golden Gate. </p>
<p>Thanks to Dr. Judy Blumhorst for her generous technical assistance through 
  her <a href="http://www.blumhorst.com">website</a> and for her spirit of innovation 
  in bringing out the full potential of the Potter 19. She also gave much needed 
  moral support to Naomi through her e-mails to Joseph Oster concerning the rugged 
  construction and unsinkable characteristics of the Potter 19.</p>
<p>And most importantly, thanks to Naomi for her reluctant yet full support for 
  my voyage, for all her help in the last minute purchase and packing of food, 
  and for her audacious surprise of being at Radio Bay to catch my dock lines. 
  What a gal.<br/>
