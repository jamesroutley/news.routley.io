<p>GPS is now a mainstay of daily life, helping us with navigation, tracking, mapping, and timing across a broad spectrum of applications. But it does have a few shortcomings, most notably not being able to pass through buildings, rocks, or water. That&#39;s why Japanese researchers have developed an alternative wireless navigation system that relies on cosmic rays, or muons, instead of radio waves, according to a <a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/pdf/S2589-0042(23)01077-5.pdf">new paper</a> published in the journal iScience. The team has conducted its first successful test, and the system could one day be used by search and rescue teams, for example, to guide robots underwater or to help autonomous vehicles navigate underground.</p>
<p>&#34;Cosmic-ray muons fall equally across the Earth and always travel at the same speed regardless of what matter they traverse, penetrating even kilometers of rock,” <a href="https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/press/z0508_00291.html">said co-author Hiroyuki Tanaka</a> of <a href="https://www.muographix.u-tokyo.ac.jp">Muographix</a> at the University of Tokyo in Japan. “Now, by using muons, we have developed a new kind of GPS, which we have called the muometric positioning system (muPS), which works underground, indoors and underwater.” </p>

<p>In 2016, scientists using muon imaging <a href="http://www.hip.institute/press/HIP_INSTITUTE_CP9_EN.pdf" data-uri="09d9c505ce7c4261b2265fc346e4ba82">picked up signals</a> indicating a hidden corridor behind the famous chevron blocks on the north face of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza" data-uri="677a3018b2e3a94b7eec249f83ef0591">Great Pyramid of Giza</a> in Egypt. The following year, the same team <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/scientists-confirm-theres-a-mysterious-void-in-the-great-pyramid/" data-uri="e06a966074c25d8464f6efc4745c7aca">detected a mysterious void</a> in another area of the pyramid, believing it could be a hidden chamber, which was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/scientists-have-mapped-a-secret-hidden-corridor-in-great-pyramid-of-giza/" data-uri="aea1fed276fb71de7ef94c7523f0d051">subsequently</a> mapped out using two different <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36351-0?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_PF018_ECOM_GL_PHSS_ALWYS_DEEPLINK&amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;utm_term=PID100017430&amp;CJEVENT=b4919ea8f32f11ed8238021a0a82b836" rel="nofollow" data-ml-dynamic="true" data-ml-dynamic-type="sl" data-orig-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36351-0?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=commission_junction&amp;utm_campaign=CONR_PF018_ECOM_GL_PHSS_ALWYS_DEEPLINK&amp;utm_content=textlink&amp;utm_term=PID100017430&amp;CJEVENT=b4919ea8f32f11ed8238021a0a82b836" data-ml-id="1" data-ml="true" data-xid="fr1686920787417bed" data-skimlinks-tracking="xid:fr1686920787417bed" data-uri="abd870fcfa5f9352dc18d8dd210651cd">muon imaging</a> methods. And <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/cosmic-rays-reveal-hidden-ancient-burial-chamber-underneath-naples/">just last month</a>, scientists <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=100098X1555750&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.4.2-stackpath&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Farstechnica.com%2Fscience%2F2023%2F05%2Fcosmic-rays-reveal-hidden-ancient-burial-chamber-underneath-naples%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-023-32626-0&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=0de6d2c9423163ec00d9ee714e862bc9&amp;xcust=xid%3Afr1686920787417gdj&amp;cci=ba7f25299a45408bf3ad0824e74b3572">used muon imaging</a> to discover a previously hidden chamber at the ruins of the ancient necropolis of Neapolis, some 10 meters (about 33 feet) below modern-day Naples, Italy.</p>
<p>Autonomous robots and vehicles could one day be commonplace in homes, hospitals, factories, and mining operations, as well as for search and rescue missions, but there is not yet a universal means of navigation and positioning, per Tanaka <em>et al</em>. As noted, GPS can&#39;t penetrate underground or underwater. RFID technologies can achieve good accuracy with small batteries, but they require a control center with servers, printers, monitors, and so forth. Dead reckoning is plagued by chronic estimation errors without an external signal to provide correction. Acoustic, laser scanner, and lidar approaches also have drawbacks. So Tanaka and his colleagues turned to muons when developing their own alternative system.</p>
