<p>It is hard to comprehend the benefits of granting everyone equal access to green space. From a health perspective, being in nature helps to lower stress levels through hearing natural sounds like birdsong and interacting with phytoncides, chemicals released by trees that soothe our nervous systems, improving digestion, sleep and general wellbeing (Qing Li 2010). I know I have felt instantly relaxed when stepping into a woodland many times over the course of this traineeship! Furthermore, vitamin D also known as the happy hormone, something Black and Asian people with melanated skin are often deficient in is naturally obtained from being outside. You are more likely to want to go outside if you are able to access greenery and escape the grey concrete jungle easily.</p>
<p>You are also more likely to learn about what surrounds us and engage with environmental issues if you are connected to green spaces. This is evident through the excitement I have seen on a child’s face when they find a newt, pond dipping in forest school or an adult’s face upon spotting a heron at Walthamstow Wetlands. After doing this traineeship I no longer walk through a park and just see green, I see a plethora of species battling for my attention.</p>
<p>My wish is for everyone to see the world through these green-tinted glasses and realise how much it is worth saving.</p>
