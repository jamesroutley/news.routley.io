    <h1>The Awk Programming Language, Second Edition</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p> The book will be available by the end of September.  In the
meantime, we will add material that we hope will be of interest --
historical documents, bits of code, and occasional essays on Awk and
related topics.

 <a href="https://awk.dev/awk.spe.pdf"><i>AWK - A Pattern Scanning and Processing Language</i></a>,
the original Awk paper from <i>Software Practice and Experience</i>, 1979.

<!-- This paper from 1978 appears to be an internal memo (though not formatted as such)
from which the SPE paper was derived:
 <a href="awk.paper.1978.pdf">here</a>
-->

 <a href="https://awk.dev/cstr118.pdf">CSTR 118</a>:

An internal technical report on Awk, dated June 1985, so it&#39;s not the
original language but more or less the one described in the Awk book
in 1988.

</p><p>
 <a href="https://github.com/arnoldrobbins/dformat">dformat</a>:
   Dformat is an Awk program, originally written by Jon Bentley,
   for drawing data-format diagrams.
   The version here comes from Arnold Robbins (to whom thanks),
   who has fixed it up and made it work properly in today&#39;s environments.

</p><p>

 <a href="https://awk.dev/chem.pdf">chem</a>:

Chem was an experiment in little languages, a language for describing chemical
structure diagrams.  (Think benzene rings on steroids.)  It wasn&#39;t much used
but it was a good exercise.

The link above is to a somewhat blurry but complete PDF of the original chem paper
by Bentley, Lynn Jelinski and bwk, published in <i>Computational Chemistry</i> in
1987.

</p><p>
 <a href="https://netlib.org/typesetting/indexing.tools"> indexing programs:</a>

One of the examples in the original Awk book was a simplified version of indexing tools
first created by Jon Bentley, and used both for both editions of the book.  The link
above provides the code; the paper published in 
<i>Electronic Publishing -- Origination Dissemination and Design</i> in 1988
is temporarily unavailable.

 <a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/compsystems/1991/win_bentley.pdf">Algorithm animation</a>:
   by Jon Bentley and bwk.
The paper <i> A System for Algorithm Animation </i> (1991) describes a
system for embedding simple graphics commands in program output that
could be used to display an &#34;animated&#34; version of the output.  It all
worked on monochrome displays, so it&#39;s totally dated now, but it was
neat at the time.  The original Computing Science Technical Report (CSTR) 132 is 
 <a href="https://awk.dev/anim.cstr132.pdf">here</a>.
