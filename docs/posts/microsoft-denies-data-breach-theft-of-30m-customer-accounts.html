<p>Microsoft has denied the claims of the so-called hacktivists “Anonymous Sudan” that they breached the company&#39;s servers and stole credentials for 30 million customer accounts.</p>
<p>Anonymous Sudan is known for debilitating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/scandinavian-airlines-says-cyberattack-caused-passenger-data-leak/" target="_blank">Western entities</a> in recent months. The group has <a href="https://flashpoint.io/blog/anonymous-sudan-ddos-timeline/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">confirmed</a> their affiliation with pro-Russian hacktivists like Killnet.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-confirms-azure-outlook-outages-caused-by-ddos-attacks/" target="_blank">Microsoft admitted</a> that Anonymous Sudan was responsible for service disruptions and outages at the beginning of June that impacting several of its services, including Azure, Outlook, and OneDrive.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the hacktivists alleged that they had “successfully hacked Microsoft” and “accessed a large database containing more than 30 million Microsoft accounts, emails, and passwords.”</p>
<p>Anonymous Sudan offered to sell this database to interested parties for $50,000 and urged interested buyers to engage in contact with their Telegram bot to arrange the purchase of the data.</p>

<p>The post even includes a sample of the data they offered (allegedly stolen from Microsoft) as proof of the breach and warned that Microsoft would deny those claims.</p>
<p>The group provided 100 credential pairs but their origin could not be verified (old data, the result of a breach at third-party service provider, stolen from Microsoft’s systems).</p>
<p>BleepingComputer has contacted Microsoft to request a comment on the validity of Anonymous Sudan&#39;s saying and a company spokesperson flatly denied any data breach claims.</p>
<p>“At this time, our analysis of the data shows that this is not a legitimate claim and an aggregation of data,” a company representative told BleepingComputer.</p>
<p>“We have seen no evidence that our customer data has been accessed or compromised” - Microsoft spokesperson</p>
<p>It is unclear at the moment if Microsoft&#39;s investigation is complete or it&#39;s ongoing. Also, the company&#39;s reaction to the potential public release of the data remains to be seen.</p>
