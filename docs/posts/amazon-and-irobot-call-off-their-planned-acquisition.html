The commission argued that Amazon could delist or reduce rival products&#39; prominence in search results or elsewhere.</p><p>&#34;Our in-depth investigation preliminarily showed that the acquisition of iRobot would have enabled Amazon to foreclose iRobot&#39;s rivals by restricting or degrading access to the Amazon Stores,&#34; Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission&#39;s executive vice president, said in a statement. She added that Amazon&#39;s control over the marketplace &#34;could have restricted competition in the market for robot vacuum cleaners, leading to higher prices, lower quality, and less innovation for consumers.&#34;</p><p>&#34;We&#39;re disappointed that Amazon&#39;s acquisition of iRobot could not proceed,&#34; David Zapolsky, senior vice president and general counsel at Amazon, said in a release.</p><p>iRobot said it would focus on margin improvements, reduce spending on research and development, and pause all work on &#34;non-floorcare&#34; products, including its air purifiers and robotic lawn mowers.</p><p>&#34;The termination of the agreement with Amazon is disappointing, but iRobot now turns toward the future with a focus and commitment to continue building thoughtful robots and intelligent home innovations that make life better,&#34; iRobot&#39;s Angle said in a release.</p><p>Amazon will pay iRobot a previously agreed upon $94 million breakup fee. The terminated deal, first announced in 2022, would have originally valued iRobot at roughly $1.7 billion.</p><p>The robotic vacuum maker has a market capitalization of under $400 million, following Monday&#39;s news and prior reports that the EU would move to block the deal.</p><p>In July, iRobot entered into a $200 million financing facility from the Carlyle Group, in order to fund the company&#39;s operations as a stopgap until the Amazon deal closed.</p><p>Amazon declined to provide a comment beyond the release.</p><p>Regulators around the world have moved to scrutinize large technology companies, citing potential anti-competitive effects. Amazon is also one of the subjects of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/25/ftc-looking-into-ai-deals-at-amazon-alphabet-microsoft-openai-.html">a Federal Trade Commission inquiry</a> into the investments and partnerships between Big Tech and artificial intelligence developers such as Anthropic and OpenAI.</p><p>In Europe, both Britain&#39;s Competition and Markets Authority and the EU&#39;s European Commission have delayed or halted several deals.
