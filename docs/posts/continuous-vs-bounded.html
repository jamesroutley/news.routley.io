    <h1>Continuous vs Bounded</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>Nonstandard analysis gives a nice link between continuous and bounded functions,
which are small and large-scale notions.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Let \(X\) and \(Y\) be topological spaces. Identify them with their nonstandard
extensions. A function \(f: X \rightarrow Y\) is <em>continuous</em> if
\(x \approx x&#39; \implies f(x) \approx f(x&#39;)\). Intuitively, infinitely
close points go to infinitely close points.</p>

<p>\(f\) is <em>bounded</em> if \(x \sim x&#39; \implies f(x) \sim f(x&#39;)\) where \(\sim\)
means “is a limited distance from”. Intuitively, points that are a limited
distance from each other go to points a limited distance from each
other.</p>

<p>Notice these definitions are almost the same. Only the equivalence relation of “being
infinitely close” is replaced with the equivalence relation of “being a limited
distance away”.</p>
