<p>Borís Vasíl&#39;yevich Spásskiy was born on January 30, 1937 in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg). The two-time Soviet Champion and ex-World Champion immigrated to France in 1976, and became a French citizen. He returned to Russia in 2012, where <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/boris-spaky-in-grave-condition">he suffered a major stroke</a> that left him bound to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Arkady Dvorkovich, the president of FIDE, said: “He was not only one of the greatest players of the Soviet era and the world, but also a true gentleman. His contributions to chess will never be forgotten.”</p>
<p>The general newspapers and chess news outlets will be full of the news of Spassky&#39;s passing, with copious descriptions of his career. Read for instance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/world/europe/boris-spassky-dead.html">Dylan Loeb McClain&#39;s article</a> in the New York Times, published just hours after the news broke. In any case, there are many comprehensive biographical articles, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Spassky">like this one in Wikipedia</a>. I do not want to add to these, but instead describe the Spassky I knew.</p>
<h3>On a personal note</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://interjectedfuture.com/portals/all/2024/ff/Chess-stories01.jpg"/>In the book <em>Chess Stories,</em> <a href="https://en.chessbase.com/post/chess-stories-now-in-english">now available in English</a>, there is a chapter by me on my decades-long friendship with Boris Spassky. I will link to it at the bottom of this article. Here&#39;s a short summary.</p>
<p>I first met Boris Spassky in the late 1970s, in Hamburg, where he was part of the commercial presentation of a new chess playing computer. Then in Munich in 1979, where Boris was playing in a GM tournament. My friend Helmut Pfleger, who is a medical doctor, was conducting an experiment to monitor the blood pressure and heart rates of players during a game. Spassky was one of the volunteers, and I assisted in attaching the monitors to his arm each day. We slowly became friends.</p>
<p>In 1988, I travelled to the Candidates Tournament in Saint John, Canada. When the plane landed in Toronto they said we had missed the onward flight, and gave me a very nice room, in a very nice hotel. There I went down to dinner, and suddenly Boris Spassky walks up to me and says, “Excuse me, Mr. Frederic, I recognized you on the plane, but I did not want to disturb you. Maybe we could now have dinner together?” I was stunned that one of the greatest chess players in the world would come to me in such a courteous way. We had a sumptuous dinner, with an endless supply of good Canadian wine. We sat there till four in the morning, and Boris told me eighty percent of everything I know about chess history.</p>
<p>After that night in the hotel restaurant, every time we met, we always spoke at length, and often had dinner together. Twice a year I would get a phone call from him: &#34;I need you to fill my samovar,&#34; he&#39;d say. That meant I had to send him new games for his Mega Database.</p>
<p>The next major encounter came many years later, when there was a Candidates Tournament in Elista, Russia. Boris was there doing commentary. We usually took lunch and dinner at the same table, and I witnessed something quite extraordinary: many young players crowded around us, listening to Boris. He was an old man, but everyone was interested in talking to him. He was charismatic and charming, full of stories!</p>
<p>After Boris moved back to Moscow, he became very frail. When I saw pictures or videos of him, I felt sad, because the man with whom I roamed the steppe was so vigorous and healthy. Not so long ago, somebody asked him what he did for his chess preparation. He replied: “I do not prepare for chess. I am preparing for – death! It is a long and difficult endgame.” </p>
