The iPhone 14 Pro introduces a massive resolution jump to 48MP, quadrupling the iPhone 13 Pro’s sensor.</p><p>When I learned about the increase in resolution of the iPhone 14 Pro sensor, I was cautiously excited. I’ve long been happy with the 12MP files coming out of my iPhone, and I know higher resolution sensors often have their trade-offs. All that said, I was excited to see this massive jump in megapixels in the iPhone 14 Pro as it will open doors to capture more detail, crop in on images, and also open up new possibilities for larger format prints at higher DPIs.</p><p>I crop 100% of my images. Whether by just a few pixels or cropping out most of the frame, I use cropping as a tool to balance/direct the viewers eye to where I want it and to cut out the fluff.</p><p>See this example image below. The image feels simple, clean, and focused with no distractions in the frame. Your eye knows right where to land comfortably because there’s nothing to pull it away.</p>

At 12 megapixels, we generally aren’t blowing up our iPhone photos to larger sizes (unless they are shot in Pano mode), but quadrupling image resolution means we have way more flexibility for large format prints shot on iPhone. I shot this BTS image of Jordan (below) and am really excited to send it off to my lab (<a href="http://prodpi.com/">ProDPI</a>) to be printed extra large for the wall in his house.</p>

I’ve found them to be mostly around 80MB, with the smallest files as low as 45MB (a shot with mostly sky and little detail), and the biggest being 115MB (a shot with tons of detail in leaves). For comparison, my Sony A1 (50 megapixel) RAW files are usually in the 120MB range. The image pixel dimensions of the 48 MP files are 8064x6048.</p><p>I’ve made the following 48MP ProRAW DNG file available for download. Just click the link below.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1663165379916_121837"><div><p><strong>Shooting at 48MP in Low-light Conditions</strong></p><p>When we went out on the boat looking for whales in the evening, I switched from 48MP to 12MP because I knew I’d be dealing with fast-moving subjects (animals) and shooting from a moving platform on the boat. This meant the camera is super responsive and will be rendering the best possible image files in these limited lighting conditions.</p>


</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1663092081828_15256"><div><p><strong>Best Camera Settings</strong></p><p>When I first started shooting with iPhone 14 Pro, I was thinking about it as my new 48 megapixel camera, assuming I would just always be shooting 48MP ProRAW. But after just a few days using it, I’m pretty sure I’ll generally leave my settings set to 12MP ProRAW and only push up to 48MP when I really need it. Here are a few reasons why:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>12 megapixels is still where the camera really shines — it’s lightning fast, it’s the same resolution across all lenses, and it’s fantastic in low light.</p></li><li><p>Capturing in 48 megapixels is a bit slow. It’s not crazy slow, but it’s slower than I’m used to, and I feel like I miss shots in the moments between frames when the iPhone is processing the larger 48MP files.</p></li><li><p>Available storage options (both in the iPhone and iCloud) have not expanded despite the file sizes being so much bigger, and I don’t want to run out of space.</p></li><li><p>Battery life seems to get zapped more quickly when shooting all day at 48MP.</p></li><li><p>In most cases, 12 megapixels is more than enough. I like the idea of higher resolution, but in reality I don’t need it in most daily shooting scenarios.</p></li></ol><p>So I’ll default to 12MP ProRAW and think of 48MP ProRAW as a bit of a “boost mode” —  activating it in specific scenarios, such as capturing a beautiful landscape (like the sunny mountain landscape above) with the intent to print.</p>


</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1663160359407_10683"><div><h3>quad-pixels and low-light</h3><p>When shooting in low-light conditions, the iPhone 14 Pro automatically trades the super high resolution for much better image fidelity. It does this by stepping down from 48MP to 12MP, which effectively increases the pixel size, keeping the image grain smoother and the detail sharper.</p><p>I shot the image below handheld about an hour after sunset and as the moon was rising in front of us.</p>

When this happens, I’ve been bringing the ProRAW files into Lightroom CC and adjusting the “Apple ProRAW” profile slider to the left to reduce the HDR/sharp look if it’s too much for me.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1663177140999_28292"><p>Action mode speaks for itself — just check out the results below.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1663171615346_66371"><div><p>We found Action mode to work very well in outdoor, daylight scenarios, especially when handheld compared to hard-mounting to a moving vehicle.</p><p>At times, we were caught a little off-guard at how much light it needed. For instance, inside an airport during daytime, it didn’t work because it needed more light. It’s also important to realize the field-of-view crop is substantial (because the software is using the outer edges of the frame for stabilization), so shooting with the .5x Ultra Wide lens is closer to the FOV you’re used to with the 1x Main lens.</p>

Much of my work takes me beyond the range of cell signal (for the last week in Scotland, we’ve not had cell service), so I have a Garmin inReach MINI I carry with me — mainly as an SOS communicator for when I’m in the backcountry. Sometimes I use it for text messaging, but this is not something you can do via iPhone satellite service. I pay about $30/month for Garmin’s service, and thankfully I’ve never needed to hit the SOS button, but I carry it when I’m outdoors just in case.</p>

Keep in mind, the Garmin has its advantages with super long battery life and an extremely durable build made to withstand the rigors of multi-day expeditions, so I think it’s worth keeping around.</p><p>But probably the most exciting aspect of satellite connectivity being built into iPhone 14 Pro is that loved ones like my wife, Esther, will have it with them all the time. It’ll be ready for them to use whether they’ve planned for it or not.<br/></p><p><strong>eSIM &amp; Travel with iPhone 14 Pro</strong></p><p>I’m a bit concerned about the practicality of an eSIM-only approach for travelers with US iPhones who frequently visit the developing world. My wife and I usually land for a project, get money changed, and pick up a local SIM card so it’s easy and cheap to communicate with people in-country. I keep these SIM cards in my daily bag (see image above), and for areas I’m frequently traveling I can just swap the SIM card upon landing and be ready to go.</p><p>Apple recommends using eSIM to get your line ahead of time, so I tried to sign up for a line in East Africa (we plan to be there quite a bit next summer), but haven’t yet been able to figure out how.</p><p>I did go through a couple guides on how to set this up as I’d really like to get it to work (and I’d be thrilled to toss my bird’s nest of SIM cards), but will need more time to get it sorted out.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> if you’re curious about this for yourself, check out <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213448" target="_blank">this resource provided by Apple</a> to clarify how eSIM works for travelers.  </p>

I know the team at Halide is working on a deep dive into how all of this works, so <a href="https://lux.camera/">keep up with their blog here</a>.</p></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1663161423977_58259"><div><h3>Digital Workflow Challenges</h3><p>I really like how iCloud Photos works and syncs between all my devices. This is the method I generally use to back up my iPhone photos and edit them on my Mac, but this only works with an active and fast internet connection — and when you aren’t on a tight timeline.</p><p>Offloading photos/videos via Lightning cable is another story. I’ve had some serious pains trying to transfer content from my iPhone to my MacBook Pro. I’ve been on YouTube watching videos, unplugging, switching Lightning cables, restarting devices — doing all the things I can think of. I finally found a tip that said if you turn on Airplane mode, then Apple Photos will properly load, and thankfully it did.</p><p>These pains offloading media are not a new issue specific to the iPhone 14 Pro, and I really hope it is solved soon.</p><p>Once I finally did get the files onto my Mac, viewing the 48 MP ProRAW files in Apple Photos was pretty slow (it takes a long time to preview or zoom to 100%), so I decided I would use Image Capture to import files to the Finder and then view them in Adobe Bridge. This process was simple and direct, but then when I get the DNG files in Bridge, they all looked super dark because the ProRAW profile wasn’t loading there. I had to abandon this method.</p><p>I’m genuinely excited about the new cameras, but now I’m growing increasingly anxious about media management and post production, so I hope this stuff gets addressed soon.</p>

I’ve wasted 5+ hours just this week trying to get photos/videos off my iPhone using a combination of Apple Photos and Image Capture so I can back up, review, and share.</p></li><li><p><strong>I wish there was a quick in-camera resolution switch:</strong> I wish I could switch ProRAW resolution between 12 and 48 megapixels within the Camera app instead of buried in Settings. It feels like something I want to go back and forth between fairly often, and it’d be great if it were similar to how video resolution/frame rate is adjusted with a simple tap in the top right corner.</p></li></ul>
