The program ostensibly includes safeguards to ensure the law isn’t being used to unnecessarily spy on Americans, but it’s pretty clear from this new email that the FBI likes being able to get communications from Americans.<br/></p><p>The email obtained by <span><a data-ga="[[&#34;Embedded Url&#34;,&#34;External link&#34;,&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-section-702-us-person-queries-email/&#34;,{&#34;metric25&#34;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/fbi-section-702-us-person-queries-email/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a></span> dated April 20 was written by FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate and sent out to employees internally.<br/></p><p>“To continue to demonstrate why tools like this are essential to our mission, we need to <em>use</em> them, while also holding ourselves accountable for doing so properly and in compliance with legal requirements,” the email reads, according to Wired, which notes that the italicization on the word “use” was in the original email.</p><p>The FBI email made things even more explicit by encouraging searches for Americans when looking through intercepted communications.<br/></p><p>“I urge everyone to continue to look for ways to appropriately use US  person queries to advance the mission, with the added confidence that  this new pre-approval requirement will help ensure that those queries  are fully compliant with the law,” the email reads.</p><p>The FBI’s response to Wired is particularly interesting, making it worth quoting at length. From Wired:<br/></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Following publication, FBI spokesperson Susan McKee provided a statement  from the bureau that mischaracterized WIRED’s reporting, inaccurately  claiming it “alleged that that the FBI instructed its employees to  violate the law or FBI policies.” The statement added that Abbate’s  email “emphasized Congress’ recognition of the vital importance of FISA  Section 702 to protect the American people and was sent to ensure that  FBI personnel were immediately aware of, and in compliance with, the  privacy enhancing changes the law has put in place.”</p></blockquote><p>Obviously, the FBI is going to say everyone at the agency follows the law since they quite literally are the law. But Wired spoke with Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California who notes this newly leaked email “directly contradicts earlier assertions” by the FBI when the agency was trying to get the law reauthorized.</p><p>It’s all a mess. The FBI got exactly what it wanted with the reauthorization of Section 702, something that was never really in doubt, even with pressure from a handful of politicians who opposed it.
