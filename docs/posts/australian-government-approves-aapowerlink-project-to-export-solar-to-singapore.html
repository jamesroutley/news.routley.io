<p><em>Dear blog,</em></p>
<p><em>It has been almost a month since my previous update. How did that happen?</em></p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="time-goes-by-at-a-mostly-constant-rate-but-my-energy-levels-fluctuate-wildly"><a href="#time-goes-by-at-a-mostly-constant-rate-but-my-energy-levels-fluctuate-wildly" aria-label="Anchor link for: time-goes-by-at-a-mostly-constant-rate-but-my-energy-levels-fluctuate-wildly">§</a>Time goes by at a (mostly) constant rate,<sup><a href="#0">1</a></sup> but my energy levels fluctuate wildly</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, even though I enjoy sharing my writing with others, writing also takes a lot of energy.
It is too easy for me to skip blogging when my energy levels are already low (for reasons I explain further down).
I usually write on the weekends, but after spending so much energy during the week, I 
needed my weekends to provide me a break (and taking breaks without feeling guilty has always been hard for me, 
as it has <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ntietz.com/blog/integrate-rest-into-your-work-and-practice/">for others</a>).</p>
<h3 id="building-a-simple-web-browser-gui-really-took-it-out-of-me"><a href="#building-a-simple-web-browser-gui-really-took-it-out-of-me" aria-label="Anchor link for: building-a-simple-web-browser-gui-really-took-it-out-of-me">§</a>Building a simple web browser GUI really took it out of me</h3>
<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://annahope.me/blog/rc-week-3/#web-browser">in my last post,</a> I am following 
the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://browser.engineering">Web Browser Engineering</a> book, but <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anna-hope/browser">in Rust</a> 
instead of Python. I also mentioned that
my challenge at the time of writing that post was choosing a Rust GUI framework 
among the many unstable, or semi-experimental, or kind of unergonomic options on offer. And finding one that worked
exactly the way I wanted so that I could follow the book&#39;s approach, if not exactly, then at least in spirit. </p>
<p>The Browser Engineering book has you build a GUI in a very manual, no-frills way. Instead of using a GUI framework&#39;s 
high-level abstractions like widgets, it has you draw text to the screen &#39;directly,&#39; meaning you manually figure out
where the text should go on the screen given the size of the text and size of the window, then put your text at that
exact place.</p>
<p>The book uses <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk_(software)">Tk</a>, likely because Python has Tk bindings
in its standard library. Some cool people have published crates with Tk bindings 
for Rust, but one crate <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/oooutlk/tcltk/issues/15">might not work on macOS</a>
(which is my primary OS), and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://codeberg.org/peterlane/rstk/">another is unmaintained.</a> </p>
<p>So it took me, like, 3 weeks (??!) to find a GUI framework in Rust that would let me put some <em>goshdarn</em> text on 
the <em>goshdarn</em> screen at the exact <em>goshdarn</em> <code>x, y</code> coordinate I wanted to <em>goshdarn</em> put it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I first tried <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/gtk-rs/gtk4-rs">gtk4-rs</a> because it appeared to be the most mature. Unfortunately 
for me, GTK was made for serious people to make serious software, and not something silly like a toy web browser.
I found no good way to bypass all of GTK&#39;s many, many layers of abstraction, and was losing myself in docs 
for both Rust and C bindings, so that I could just figure out a way to draw text onto 
the screen. I was stuck in the sunk cost fallacy mode with <code>gtk4-rs</code> for nearly two weeks, trying to make it work 
in a way that was close to the book, before I admitted to myself (and others)<sup><a href="#1">2</a></sup> 
that I was not making meaningful progress, and finally decided to abandon <code>gtk4-rs</code> out and start over with...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://iced.rs/">Iced.</a> I think Iced is a very promising framework, and I appreciate that its creator(s) are
trying to build a GUI framework that tries to work with Rust&#39;s memory management model instead of around it 
(ahem, <code>gtk4-rs</code>), and shift as many errors to compile time instead of run time (ahem again, <code>gtk4-rs</code>).<sup><a href="#2">3</a></sup> But Iced 
is also very heavily in development, with potentially breaking changes on every commit, and the docs can be hard
to follow (or not exist, or not match the current codebase). To be fair, the documentation itself 
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.iced.rs/iced/index.html#disclaimer">makes all that clear upfront,</a> so my frustrations are on me.
And there were things about Iced that I found very elegant once things clicked. But, ultimately, I still couldn&#39;t
figure out how to just draw text on the screen at a given <code>x, y</code> coordinate. So, once again, I forced myself to
move on and start again with...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://docs.rs/egui/latest/egui/index.html">egui.</a> Long story short, this was the winner 🎉</p>
<ul>
<li>
Easy to use and get started with (as promised)</li>
<li>
Offers widgets and other abstractions, but doesn&#39;t force you to use them</li>
<li>
Has decent docs (I have to admit that after <code>gtk4-rs</code> and <code>Iced</code>, my bar was very low)</li>
<li>
Lets me put some <em>goshdarn</em> text on the <em>goshdarn</em> screen at some specific <em>goshdarn</em> coordinates</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am still upset that this GUI journey ate up so much of my time,<sup><a href="#3">4</a></sup> but I&#39;m glad that I got there in the end.
If not for other Recursers in the Web Browser Engineering study group, I would&#39;ve probably abandoned it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Recurse community: win</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, I burnt a lot of energy on this project, and several weeks of repeatedly
rebuilding the GUI from scratch in yet another framework brought me no joy 
(as much as it was a learning experience — or at least I <em>hope</em> it was). When I finally made my text 
layout logic work in <code>egui</code>, 
I <em>did</em> feel a <em>very high</em> high, and that somewhat made up for the hard time I had getting there.<sup><a href="#4">5</a></sup></p>
<p>But it&#39;s made me think about what I really want to get out of the rest of my time at RC — especially because,
continuing to surprise no one, that time has been moving <em>very fast.</em> I plan to continue with Web Browser Engineering, 
but I also want to leave time to explore other things. More joy, less frustration about implementation details.</p>
<p>And more opportunities for collaborating with other Recursers.</p>
<h3 id="struggling-to-build-a-sqlite-clone-in-zig-made-me-appreciate-other-recursers-even-more"><a href="#struggling-to-build-a-sqlite-clone-in-zig-made-me-appreciate-other-recursers-even-more" aria-label="Anchor link for: struggling-to-build-a-sqlite-clone-in-zig-made-me-appreciate-other-recursers-even-more">§</a>Struggling to build a SQLite clone in Zig made me appreciate other Recursers even more</h3>
<p>One of my goals for my batch at RC has been to learn Zig. Another was to learn how databases work from the ground up.
I have been trying to make progress on both by implementing a 
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anna-hope/sqlite-zig/tree/main">SQLite clone in Zig.</a></p>
<p>I originally started this project by trying to follow 
the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/sqlite/overview">Codecrafters course.</a> That turned out to be very frustrating
for me (the course, at least in its Zig version, offers little guidance beyond a high-level structure), 
and I quickly abandoned the project and stopped attending the <em>Build Your Own Database</em> study group. </p>
<p>Then, a fellow Recurser suggested 
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/">Let&#39;s Build a Simple Database in C,</a> and I thought it would be perfect
both to practice reading C, and writing Zig, and understanding how their database implementation works because 
I would need to translate from C to Zig instead of just retyping all the code as-is.<sup><a href="#5">6</a></sup></p>
<p>However, with my brain being fully subsumed by the challenge of building a simple browser GUI in Rust,
it took only a slight roadblock in my Zig implementation for me to put that project aside as well.
It would have probably stayed put aside <em>(read: abandoned),</em> 
if the Recurser who has been leading the <em>Build Your Own Database</em> study group
hadn&#39;t reached out and kindly checked in to ask if I had 
stopped attending because the time slot didn&#39;t work for me, or if there was another reason.</p>
<p>I admitted that the reason was that I felt bad about not making progress on my SQLite implementation, that I
didn&#39;t like my reason, and that I wanted to rejoin the group. </p>
<p>Since then, I have been making slow but steady progress on this project, and have paired with that Recurser 
on my SQLite-in-C-in-Zig multiple times, with every one of those times helping unblock me.
Even though he does not know Zig, his knowledge of C plus systems programming experience plus 
being ready to dig into Zig docs has helped me tremendously.</p>

<p>The whole 
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Pass-by-value-Parameters">Zig will magically decide when to pass parameters by value or by reference</a>
turned out to be a <a href="https://annahope.me/blog/rc-week-3/#zig">Chekhov&#39;s footgun,</a> because I ran into the exact problem
of 
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/anna-hope/sqlite-zig/commit/03334ed6d2cce6e8c13fdbbaaed1adaf416e2b02#r145500181">getting a copy to an element where I thought I&#39;d be getting a reference.</a></p>
<p>I still like Zig overall, but would 100% prefer less magic.</p>

<p>All of those are great, I have really enjoyed them, and have found them to be one of the most rewarding
parts of RC. RC is the only place I can do those, and I want to make the most of that.</p>

<p>Last week was the end of the previous batch, and many people I hope to stay friends with have

(batches are staggered), so there have been lots of new people to meet! </p>
<p>It&#39;s felt bittersweet.</p>

<p>I failed in my intention to blog every week. I may have needed to step away from my computer to recover,
but I still feel bad.</p>
<ul>
<li>
Writing on schedule: not win</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Of course,</em> the more I put off writing an update, the more of a Big Thing it became in my mind.
I <em>really</em> appreciate everyone who has told me they&#39;ve read my posts and offered kind and encouraging feedback!
It has helped motivate me to keep writing.</p>
<p>So, I do want to post these updates weekly, for real.</p>
