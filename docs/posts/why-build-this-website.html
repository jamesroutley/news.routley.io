    <h1>Why build this website?</h1>

    <p>I’ve been putting a lot of time into this website lately. With all of this work, I’ve been wondering: why do all of this? I don’t really have much of an audience on this blog- nor do I have much of a desire to “build a brand.” What’s the point of it all? I’ve meditated on this question and think I’ve come up with a few sources of motivation for doing all of this.</p>

<p>The first is a source of encouragement to continue creating. While it doesn’t happen too often, the occasional “I read your post about [something] and really liked it” or “this page helped me with [something else]” provides a huge source of encouragement for me. It’s really cool to know that somebody enjoyed or was helped by something you’ve made or written.</p>

<p>The flip side of this is that I really need to think through what I publish. The idea of public scrutiny on something I make or write creates a pressure to make sure it meets a certain bar of quality and notability.</p>

<p>I find this pressure to be especially helpful when writing. The threat of a skeptical mind reading my ideas forces me to really think through what I’m saying. It’s like a switch gets turned on in my brain that begins a process of considering alternative viewpoints and potential criticisms that break down or reinforce my ideas.</p>

<p>There is also pressure coming from the increased longevity of the medium. I’ve explicitly designed this website to make content discoverable in the long-term and, as such, need to be careful to ensure what I publish will hold up to the test of time. This isn’t Mastodon where I can hobble together some half-baked sentences, hurl them into a whirpool of content, and be confident that they’ll be forgotten about within a day. Instead, I hope the content I publish here will be valuable months, years, maybe even decades from their creation<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Lastly, I’ve found that the things I enjoy the most around the web have been recommended to me by humans. I really love browsing through others’ blogs and digital gardens to get recommendations for software, music, books, events, etc. Word-of-mouth is my favorite form of discovery, especially as I’ve worked to remove algorithmically generated feeds from my life. As such, the <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202310091958%20Bookmarks.html">Bookmarks</a> section of my site serves as a place for me to dole out my own recommendations to others. I throw things there in the hope that I can help someone discover their next favorite thing.</p>

<p>All of this is on top of the fact that I simply enjoy writing here. It’s a fun, healthy, and fulfilling hobby for me, regardless of whether or not people actually read any of it.</p>
