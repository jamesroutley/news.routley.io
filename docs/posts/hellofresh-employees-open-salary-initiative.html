    <h1>Hellofresh employees&#39; open salary initiative</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><span>This initiative is employee-led.</span> </span>We are inspired by our colleagues at Zalando, who have been sharing their salaries with each other for years.<span><span> <span>EU, US and Canadian labor laws protect your right to discuss your salary!</span></span></span> For example, see <span>this court decision: openjur.de/u/342735.html.</span></p></div><div><div><p><span><span>How does it work?</span></span></p></div></div><div><p>If a colleague wants access to this information, ask them to fill out the form first, same as you did, no shortcuts. This only works if people participate. <span>Please don&#39;t share outside of HelloFresh,<span> </span><span>but do share with as many colleagues as possible!</span></span></p></div><div></div><div><p><span><span>FAQs</span></span></p></div><div><p>1. Why fill out this form?</p></div><div><p>HelloFresh is notoriously secretive when it comes to compensation. Even though the salary bands for most job positions were revised in 2021, you&#39;re probably still wondering what that means for you. Knowing what other people at the company are paid for similar work helps bridge the information gap between you and HelloFresh, which is especially useful in salary negotiations. The data we gather here will also be useful in highlighting any structural unfairness (e.g. between the genders).</p></div><div><p>2. What is the goal of this Initiative?</p></div><div><p>Our ultimate goal is to help convince senior leadership to be more transparent about the decisions they make around employee compensation. A good step in that direction would be making the salary bands available to all employees. </p></div><div><p>3. Is the data I put in anonymous?</p></div><div><div><p>No. Anonymized data is already available on sites like Glassdoor. The data you input here (apart from your personal email and comments) will be shared with every employee, as long as they fill out the form first.</p></div></div></div></div>
