<p><b>Wronger than wrong</b> is a statement that equates two errors when one of the errors is clearly more wrong than the other. It was described by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shermer" title="Michael Shermer">Michael Shermer</a> as <b>Asimov&#39;s axiom</b>.<sup id="cite_ref-Shermer_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Shermer-1">[1]</a></sup> The mistake was discussed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>&#39;s book of essays <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Relativity_of_Wrong" title="The Relativity of Wrong">The Relativity of Wrong</a></i><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> as well as in a 1989 article<sup id="cite_ref-Asimov_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Asimov-3">[3]</a></sup> of the same name in the Fall 1989 issue of the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_Inquirer" title="Skeptical Inquirer">Skeptical Inquirer</a></i>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>When people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the Earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.</p></blockquote>
<p>Asimov explained that science is both progressive and cumulative. Even though scientific theories are later proven wrong, the degree of their wrongness attenuates with time as they are modified in response to the mistakes of the past.<sup id="cite_ref-Shermer_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-Shermer-1">[1]</a></sup> For example, data collected from satellite measurements show, to a high level of precision, how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure_of_the_Earth" title="Figure of the Earth">Earth&#39;s shape</a> differs from a perfect sphere or even an oblate spheroid or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid" title="Geoid">geoid</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Shermer_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-Shermer-1">[1]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Shermer stated that being wronger than wrong is actually worse than being <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong" title="Not even wrong">not even wrong</a></i> (that is, being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfalsifiable" title="Unfalsifiable">unfalsifiable</a>).<sup id="cite_ref-Shermer_1-3"><a href="#cite_note-Shermer-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Holmes_Jenkins" title="John Holmes Jenkins">John Jenkins</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> who reviewed <i>The Relativity of Wrong</i>, the title essay of Asimov&#39;s book is the one &#34;which I think is important both for understanding Asimov&#39;s thinking about science and for arming oneself against the inevitable anti-science attack that one often hears – [that] theories are always preliminary and science really doesn&#39;t &#39;know&#39; anything.&#34;
