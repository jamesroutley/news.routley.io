Power.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-1">Build quality of certain parts such as audio systems and cup-holders have resulted in quality issues, the report said, which collected data from 93,380 purchasers and lessees of 2023 model-year vehicles.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Automakers have been leaning on software and technology as they rush to roll out innovative models amid easing supply constraints and labor shortages.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">Problems per 100 vehicles (PP100) rose 30 PP100 during the past two years, the report said. A lower score reflects higher vehicle quality.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Quality ratings of Tesla Inc <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/TSLA.O/" target="_blank">(TSLA.O)</a>, which is not officially ranked among other brands in the study as it did not meet ranking criteria, increased by 31 PP100 year-over-year to 257 PP100 in 2023.</p><figure data-testid="image-0"><div data-testid="Image"></div><figcaption data-testid="Body">A nighttime view of vehicle traffic along the Interstate 405 (I-405) highway in Carson, California, U.S., March 11, 2022.
