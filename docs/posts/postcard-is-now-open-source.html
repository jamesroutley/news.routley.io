      <p>In 2022, I launched <a href="https://www.contraption.co/launching-postcard/" rel="noreferrer">Postcard</a> as a personal website + newsletter. I had deleted social media, and <a href="https://www.philipithomas.com/posts/how-to-replace-social-media-with-a-personal-newsletter?ref=contraption.co" rel="noreferrer">wanted a way to stay in touch with friends via email</a>. It powers my personal website, <a href="https://philipithomas.com/?ref=contraption.co" rel="noreferrer">philipithomas.com</a>, where <a href="https://www.philipithomas.com/posts/?ref=contraption.co" rel="noreferrer">I&#39;ve published monthly &#34;What I&#39;m up to&#34; every month since</a>.</p><p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33549267&amp;ref=contraption.co" rel="noreferrer">Postcard&#39;s launch was well-received</a> and thousands of people signed up. Today, many people continue to use and maintain their Postcard sites. Revenue is modest - I make dozens of dollars per month on it. But, I&#39;m happy to maintain it because I believe <a href="https://www.contraption.co/introducing-contraption-co/" rel="noreferrer">dependable tools matter</a>. Today, I still maintain Postcard and the hosted service runs on a <a href="https://www.contraption.co/a-mini-data-center/" rel="noreferrer">Mac Mini on my desk.</a> </p><p>I&#39;ve decided to release the source code for Postcard. I update the service only occasionally, several developers have asked to contribute, and I no longer expect meaningful revenue from the project. Open-sourcing it feels right.</p><p>In the age of vibe coding, I think it would be fun to give people a working app they can customize. Postcard is a fairly simple application, written in <a href="https://www.contraption.co/rails-versus-nextjs/" rel="noreferrer">Ruby on Rails</a>, that works with few dependencies. So, it should be easy to run and customize.</p><p>In order to open-source Postcard, I made some changes to the code. Most significant is that I rewrote the application to support a &#34;Solo&#34; mode for running one single site, which simplifies the hosting and deployment for most open-source users. The hosted  service runs in &#34;Multiuser&#34; mode to support multiple users, custom domains, payments, and other options. The codebase includes both modes on the same <code>main</code> branch.</p><p>Deployment is straightforward. A Dockerfile is included, and a <code>render.yaml</code> file lets you ship Postcard to <a href="https://render.com/?ref=contraption.co">Render</a> with minimal setup.</p><p>Check it out, fork it, and let me know what you build:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/contraptionco/postcard?ref=contraption.co" rel="noreferrer"><strong>github.com/contraptionco/postcard</strong></a></p>
