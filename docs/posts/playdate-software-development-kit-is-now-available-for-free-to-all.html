        Questions &amp; answers about making games for Playdate
    </h2>

    <p>
        Playdate is a brand-new handheld game system, shipping soon.  Our small, yellow console-with-a-crank is the perfect platform for indie games of all kinds, made by people of all kinds.
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>    
            How do I get a Playdate devkit?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            Good news: any Playdate can be used to develop games for the platform. There won’t be any special hardware that you’ll need for this. You can <a href="https://shop.play.date/"><b>pre-order</b></a> a Playdate today.
        </dd>
        <dt>
            What&#39;s the difference between the Playdate SDK and Pulp?
        </dt>
        <dd>
             <p>
                 The Playdate SDK is the best way for experienced developers to use every  capability of the Playdate. It includes a rich set of APIs, a compiler, and documentation. You can write your games using Lua, for ease of development; or C, for games that need extra performance; or, combine both languages in the same project. Typical SDK features are included: graphics, sound, inputs, text, collisions, etc.
                 
             </p>
             <p>
                 Another neat option is our web-based game maker, <a href="https://play.date/pulp"><b>Playdate Pulp</b></a>. It’s a click-and-place game studio with all the tools you need to build your first game—or your twentieth experiment—in a quirky little environment. With Pulp, you’ll be able to create your art and music; use our scripting language, PulpScript; and preview your game, all in the browser. It&#39;s not meant to be as full-featured as our SDK, but it&#39;s a one-stop editor you can use without installing anything.
             </p>
        </dd>

        <dt>
            Do I have to pay any licensing fees for the SDK or Pulp?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            No. The Playdate SDK and Pulp are provided for free, and you&#39;re welcome to use them for whatever project you have in mind. You can read the <a href="https://play.date/dev/sdk-license"><b>Playdate SDK license</b></a> here.
        </dd>

        <dt>
            How do I distribute my Playdate game?
        </dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                You can sell or share your own Playdate code and compiled game any way you wish: sell it on your website, through an online game store, or another digital-goods marketplace. Playdate owners can sideload these games over a USB connection; or wirelessly, through our website.
            </p>
            <p>
                We realize you may be looking for an &#34;official&#34; game store as well, to make sure your game reaches a large audience. We&#39;re currently exploring different ideas for the best experience of getting games out to Playdate owners, and we&#39;ll have more to say on this in the future.
