    <h1>Framework&#39;s first desktop is a strange–but unique–mini ITX gaming PC</h1>

<p>In Framework&#39;s first-party case, the PC starts at $1,099, which gets you a Ryzen AI Max 385 (that&#39;s an 8-core CPU and 32 GPU cores) and 32GB of RAM. A fully loaded 128GB with a Ryzen AI Max+ 395 configuration (16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores) will run you $1,999. There&#39;s also an in-between build with the Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip and 64GB of RAM for $1,599. If you just want the mini ITX board to put in a case of your choosing, that starts at $799.</p>
<p>None of these are impulse buys, exactly, but they&#39;re priced a bit better than a gaming-focused mini PC like the Asus ROG NUC, which <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1860500-REG/asus_rnuc14srku7169aui_republic_of_gamers_nuc.html?ap=y&amp;smp=y&amp;msclkid=665d398fca4517ecc9d75e33332b247f">starts at nearly $1,300 as of this writing</a> and comes with half as much RAM. It&#39;s also priced well compared to what you can get out of a DIY mini ITX PC based on integrated graphics—the Ryzen 7 8700G, an AM5 ITX motherboard, and 32GB of DDR5 can all be had for around $500 collectively before you add a case, power supply, or SSD, but for considerably slower performance.</p>
<p>The volume of the Framework Desktop&#39;s first-party case is just 4.5 liters—for reference, <a href="https://ssupd.co/products/cases-meshroom-s-v2">the SSUPD Meshroom S</a> is 14.9 liters, a fairly middle-of-the-road volume for an ITX case that can fit a full-size GPU. An Xbox Series X is about 6.9 liters, and the Xbox Series S is 4.4 liters. Apple&#39;s Mac Studio is about 3.7 liters. The Framework Desktop isn&#39;t breaking records, but it&#39;s definitely tiny. </p>

      Despite the non-upgradeability of the main components, Framework has tried to stick to existing standards where it can by using a flex ATX power supply, ATX headers on the motherboard, regular 120 mm fans that can be changed out, and of course the mini ITX form factor itself.

<p>So the pitch for the system is easy: You get a reasonably powerful 1440p-capable gaming and workstation PC inside a case the size of a small game console. &#34;If the Series S could run Windows, I&#39;d buy it in a second&#34; is a thought that has occurred to me, so I can see the appeal, even though it costs at least three times as much.</p>
<p>But it does feel like a strange fit for Framework, given that it&#39;s so much <em>less</em> upgradeable than most PCs. The CPU and GPU are one piece of silicon, and they&#39;re soldered to the motherboard. The RAM is also soldered down and not upgradeable once you&#39;ve bought it, setting it apart from nearly every other board Framework sells.</p>
