                    <p>The other day I was reading about the development of personal computers and the desktop GUI, and I was thinking about how comfortable we all have become with the analogy of the “desktop” for our personal computers. We place files in folders and keep them on our desktops. There’s a lot of physical action going on.</p>
<p>Humans are very good at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_ability">understanding spaces</a>, especially when it comes to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_memory">remembering physical spaces</a>, and it got me thinking about how we commonly visualize code. Is there any good way to tap into that when thinking about and visualizing code?</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-visualize-code">How do you visualize code?</h2>
<p>This made me think about how I tend to visualize code, and it’s a little hard to describe. I think it usually lives in my head in a variety of ways, depending on the level of abstraction and specificity, and there’s some combination of all of them there at the same time. Depending on the need, I can jump between them pretty well, especially if I’m very familiar with the codebase.</p>
<p>For example, when I’m imagining the interactions between various microservices, it’s helpful to draw big boxes around each service, treating each one like a big unit of work with RPC interactions in between.</p>
