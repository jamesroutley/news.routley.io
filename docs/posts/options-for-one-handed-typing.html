    <h1>Ask HN: Options for One-Handed Typing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A relative of mine recently suffered a serious injury to their dominant (right) arm, which will have a long recovery period (likely several months). Ideally finger movement will be restored sooner, but even if so it might not be comfortable to keep the injured arm in an ergonomic typing position.</p><p>So I wanted to prepare some options for one-handed typing that they can review. At first glance, it looks like solutions fall into one of three categories:</p><p>- Trainings on how to effectively use a keyboard with one hand</p><p>- Keyboard remappings on existing hardware to use alternative key layouts that favor the keys on the left side</p><p>- Specialty keyboards that are intended to be used with one hand. Some of these seem promising but also shockingly expensive.</p><p>Any thoughts on what solutions you&#39;ve seen work / you might pursue in a similar situation?</p></div></div></div>
