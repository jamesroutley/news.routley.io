Bottle Plotter

<div id="post-body-7578344262479663453">
<h2>Bottle Plotter</h2><p><span>    </span>I have noticed that, it is quite common in group of small wine producers, that they don&#39;t use bottle labels. Usually they just draw some basic info on the bottle with special (<b>Edding</b>) paint marker. That is how I got this idea. Everybody can get paper label printed, but what about bottle plotter. CNC that would used paint marker as plotter to plot the label directly on the bottle. And with tool-changer you could also have more colors. </p><p><span>    </span>I had this idea in my head for some time, but it take me quite long time to do this mental kick-off and start to work on it. Usually, what works for me is that when the mood is right I go outside walking and fully put myself in this trans-like state where I keep iterating on that idea and create first design in my head. But the &#34;mood&#34; was not coming for some time, so once I have found myself forced to drive for 2h alone in car back home. I never tried this while driving, but I have managed to get myself into that state and come with first design. I also decided I would like to prototype it as fast as possible. </p><p><span>    </span>The plan was to create shitty design print it, test it, change it, print it. It was kind of amazing, funny but also exhausting. On beginning I started simply on the whole mechanical configuration of the plotter. Main ideas for before I started.</p><div><ul><li><i>I will putt stepper motor on free moving arm with rubber wheel touching the bottle on top and with its weight it will press on the bottle to assure contact and when running it will rotate the bottle.</i></li><li><i>Pen will be placed horizontally</i></li><li><i>There will be quite sophisticated revolver mechanism for changing pens</i></li><li><i>Bottle will be rolling on bearing on the bottom that will be done in way it could accommodate different diameters of bottles</i></li><li><i>I will make the final product as simple/cheap as possible. Maximum of 3D printing and as few types of mechanical components as possible. I decided to use M4x10 with cylindrical head as standard fastener.</i></li></ul></div><p><b>Spoiler</b>: All / Most of this proved to be wrong.</p><p><span>    </span>After putting first part together issues started to show up. Having motor on top did not work, it was trying to push the bottle not roll it every time. I decided to abandon multitool quite soon as it started to be obvious it is just big complication for now. And should be pushed to the future as &#34;Nice to have&#34;.</p><p><span>    </span>First prototype was just awful, ugly falling apart. I was printing 4 revision of some part per day. But I was learning a lot. I used some parts that I already had on hand as linear stage etc.</p><p><span>    </span>For electronics I have decided to use the cheapest thing available. Arduino CNC shield and GRBL, it is not great but cheap. I spent quite some time for debugging interference issues between limit switches and motors. </p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEivJC4I-K8AswEAcMFAHSQaw0_ftmLxJl4h6SWMzcg4kOYR2pXWwzQBc0eMG58CnZ-yuHKTIgBzF4dyBY8VEoWUzyz9-Y7ldt86d03GLBTMZc2Kju0A6J3xHFQPyP7ZthbbkFbLA3_pazEdHKTgjh7WfWfUtqoRUm2M6Z8iE0WEiYx_EwOQIGz-xjVNeiFT"><img alt="" data-original-height="3004" data-original-width="5325" height="350" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEivJC4I-K8AswEAcMFAHSQaw0_ftmLxJl4h6SWMzcg4kOYR2pXWwzQBc0eMG58CnZ-yuHKTIgBzF4dyBY8VEoWUzyz9-Y7ldt86d03GLBTMZc2Kju0A6J3xHFQPyP7ZthbbkFbLA3_pazEdHKTgjh7WfWfUtqoRUm2M6Z8iE0WEiYx_EwOQIGz-xjVNeiFT=w620-h350" width="620"/></a></p></div><p><span>    </span>On the picture is already little bit advanced version where I started testing motorized roller on bottom. But this also did not work well. One of the issue was that, as the bottle is not perfect you may end up on different spot when you are rotating back and forward. Also one the issues is that you need some freedom of movement on the pen to allow for following surface of bottle. So everything points to having the pen vertical. In hindsight it seems sooooo obvious.</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjhpYi2P53tME7Y8_vxkpvD0k_vK-08TD4gtbRJmfCaQnnZTHJhYJE-2ZTvkCwmWc0CPB6v6wXW5WT3ArXbKvZYlRRXGz4VyI7a3UQunL00h0RuZxq9zLtRLRgkICtaIyzWLrhfFpoHcechU5MTmBUKm0FAslJ9Of3EdNydJLZBPJi0Gv4IVRUzIgnPnsln"><img alt="" data-original-height="5325" data-original-width="3004" height="693" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjhpYi2P53tME7Y8_vxkpvD0k_vK-08TD4gtbRJmfCaQnnZTHJhYJE-2ZTvkCwmWc0CPB6v6wXW5WT3ArXbKvZYlRRXGz4VyI7a3UQunL00h0RuZxq9zLtRLRgkICtaIyzWLrhfFpoHcechU5MTmBUKm0FAslJ9Of3EdNydJLZBPJi0Gv4IVRUzIgnPnsln=w390-h693" width="390"/></a></p><p><span>    </span>I tried to used printed spring for the pen holder but it was not working well so I went with linear rail that I had at hand.</p><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjdC0zySVz6642bmHV8SPxK_UWJyl8BO9Z-ChQuNu6gYPi1STeVu6gLviJzHoVNbGDeqwjqwcumVgwblvb5GVUhozBZIkPv2VPZF7UUejBAj4PajcgRQ5o3DWYpF-5rhC1zIL2Na7q5G_FYJT9UXM4OyNkPT0vEyUCFOC5ps3X9pQfJqfYXRRhVXwD5L6vm"><img alt="" data-original-height="5325" data-original-width="3004" height="695" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjdC0zySVz6642bmHV8SPxK_UWJyl8BO9Z-ChQuNu6gYPi1STeVu6gLviJzHoVNbGDeqwjqwcumVgwblvb5GVUhozBZIkPv2VPZF7UUejBAj4PajcgRQ5o3DWYpF-5rhC1zIL2Na7q5G_FYJT9UXM4OyNkPT0vEyUCFOC5ps3X9pQfJqfYXRRhVXwD5L6vm=w391-h695" width="391"/></a></p><p>First more successful print </p></div><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi7Pyv73mIyGHd9pWpJvmL0mYxSKjbrU7DGPot0OItiLcFdJ6G53Ok5IKeH6B_L_ypauz_bnIslx5U_dsaYP_-6BgfDYFIk-12CNLkFeWdR-w2hu_lVRtemraXzg3UagoeCXNd2Er3qaJ32ma1a_4oIiQnQOh3l7lpuoNwcI9erCKePV7fNGCc_-pwNzbw_"><img alt="" data-original-height="3004" data-original-width="5325" height="333" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi7Pyv73mIyGHd9pWpJvmL0mYxSKjbrU7DGPot0OItiLcFdJ6G53Ok5IKeH6B_L_ypauz_bnIslx5U_dsaYP_-6BgfDYFIk-12CNLkFeWdR-w2hu_lVRtemraXzg3UagoeCXNd2Er3qaJ32ma1a_4oIiQnQOh3l7lpuoNwcI9erCKePV7fNGCc_-pwNzbw_=w588-h333" width="588"/></a></p></div><div><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiuNbBXQRvjG7eMkQtI2Yzk-wb6RoiaIbp5H82Aw7vKPZZGtn6ERNBvxerYW1l3k8UQLE5osH1TBtYuL5yRjrbY6rvxIvOLBWvYaMU435iLRgki6MOGsl9SyvOip6bOq57DeZuGc1DxXaSxLa48Rt2fk1s42qvfqnSSYhGYygXhxbDOjePv8eeSUgqcnU5F"><img alt="" data-original-height="3004" data-original-width="5325" height="328" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiuNbBXQRvjG7eMkQtI2Yzk-wb6RoiaIbp5H82Aw7vKPZZGtn6ERNBvxerYW1l3k8UQLE5osH1TBtYuL5yRjrbY6rvxIvOLBWvYaMU435iLRgki6MOGsl9SyvOip6bOq57DeZuGc1DxXaSxLa48Rt2fk1s42qvfqnSSYhGYygXhxbDOjePv8eeSUgqcnU5F=w581-h328" width="581"/></a></p><p><span>    </span>I still had issues with using bottom rollers for rotating the bottle.

This project was something I did for my own education and for fun. So that means in free time. And as I started to build <b>Positron V3</b>, then design some parts and upgrade for it for our <b>Muon3D.com</b> project. I really did not have muc time to focus on this. But luckily I was approached by my first customer who offered couple bottles of wine in exchange for working bottle plotter. </p><p><span>    </span>When I started to work on first version I was not using any master model or assembly of whole project. All was done on my table, which was helpful as I did not have really that many experience to be sure how I want to really design it. But for V2 I decided to build 3D assembly before printing and building.</p><p><u>Key ideas for <b>V2</b>:</u></p><div><ul><li><i>Use only as much standard as possible components.

How do actually prepare data for plotting on circular surface and funny enough. You don&#39;t need to everything acts as the bottle is flat surface a it rotates around its axis. The common SW workflow is that you take vector image, best is SVG. Then Convert it to G-Code that is than played to GRBL motor driver. I had issues with finding something that I would be happy with so after all I decided to slicer/CAM on my own. It is simple web pages where you upload svg and the get g-code file after some processing. There is still need for improvements, but it works and it is kind of fun to work on it.</span><br/></p><p><span><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiUnOeRBG1fR69MTQOMf-Gg5Xmn0sQcr-9aAn_x2mjBfV5GtOaL4CqFqiqUR4ADKicoaQeeB5zTxAT5knul4bTcGGe3FYdN9XEKMigtY2BH0EEBuhbhZi8x8T4uPEjGLv_XvYWoZEXCAdfdQSk8fDcXOstWJL7QbjznHYOg0YQQQ3IIJ67_jusvNCOQ0pmy"><img alt="" data-original-height="933" data-original-width="619" height="742" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiUnOeRBG1fR69MTQOMf-Gg5Xmn0sQcr-9aAn_x2mjBfV5GtOaL4CqFqiqUR4ADKicoaQeeB5zTxAT5knul4bTcGGe3FYdN9XEKMigtY2BH0EEBuhbhZi8x8T4uPEjGLv_XvYWoZEXCAdfdQSk8fDcXOstWJL7QbjznHYOg0YQQQ3IIJ67_jusvNCOQ0pmy=w492-h742" width="492"/></a></p></span></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p><span>    </span>I&#39;m happy I managed to test both, rapid iteration and more controlled way of building stuff. Again looking on the final machine everything looks as very obvious solution. Which is annoying as it took me quite some time to get to that. But it is also sign that it is probably the right one. I was also able to get the component price for everything for around 150$ without printed parts.</p><p>And another thing. I was not really able to find some G-Code generator that I would be happy with so I build my own. </p><p><b>PS: I&#39;m looking someone to help me open source it.</b></p></div></div>

I&#39;m somehow interested in audio production. But not it more my pet hobby, nothing that would generate decent income. This means I usually don&#39;t want to spend much of money on the equipment.  Right about now is quite good time to get some old-ish wireless audio equipment for decent price. The reason is that there was change ( info ) in wireless bands and bands that used to be free before are not available for the professional audio anymore. That means that lot of productions are ditching their stuff to buy new one, compatible. But not all the old stuff is useless as some of it can be reprogrammed. There is tight window from 822 to 830 MHz in EU. This window is quite narrow, but at least it should granted all the time for professional audio. Other option is to go below 700Mhz, but then you might get into collision with local TV transmitter. Therefore I settled for the narrow band since I don&#39;t plan to use too many transmitters at once and this should work for me well. My movi

 Understanding what is going on I2C In the previous step I hooked up my logic analyzer on the I2C to see how the communication inside the mic actually looks like. Partially because I want to understand better how to reprogram the microphones EEPROM but also because I&#39;m just curious and want to see what is really going on. After powering up the microphone this is the output from I2C. write to 0x3E ack data: 0xE0 0xC8 0xF0 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00  write to 0x3E ack data: 0xE0 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00  write to 0x50 ack data: 0x10  read to 0x50 ack data: 0x11 write to 0x51 ack data: 0x1A  read to 0x50 ack data: 0xA9 write to 0x51 ack data: 0xB3  read to 0x50 ack data: 0x1F write to 0x51 ack data: 0xAE  read to 0x50 ack data: 0x03 write to 0x51 ack data: 0xAF  read to 0x50 ack data: 0x20 write to 0x51 ack data: 0xAC  read to 0x50 ack data: 0xFC write to 0x51 ack data: 0xAD  read to 0x50 ack data: 0x5D write to 0x51 ack data: 0xC4  read
