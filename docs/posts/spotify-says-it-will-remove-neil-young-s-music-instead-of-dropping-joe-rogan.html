<p>With Neil Young having told Spotify that it can keep him or podcaster Joe Rogan but not both, the streaming company today said it will remove Young&#39;s catalog of music.</p>
<p>&#34;We want all the world&#39;s music and audio content to be available to Spotify users,&#34; Spotify said in a <a href="https://deadline.com/2022/01/neil-young-leaving-spotify-joe-rogan-covid-vaccines-1234920496/">statement to Deadline</a> and other media organizations. &#34;With that comes great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators. We have detailed content policies in place, and we&#39;ve removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to COVID since the start of the pandemic. We regret Neil&#39;s decision to remove his music from Spotify but hope to welcome him back soon.&#34;</p>
<p>Young&#39;s music was still on Spotify as of this writing but will presumably be removed soon unless either Young or Spotify change their minds. Objecting to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/21/1074442185/joe-rogan-doctor-covid-podcast-spotify-misinformation">misinformation about COVID</a> aired on Rogan&#39;s podcast, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/01/neil-young-threatens-to-pull-songs-from-spotify-over-joe-rogan-podcast/">Young told Warner Records</a> this week that Spotify &#34;has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I want you to let Spotify know immediately TODAY that I want all my music off their platform,&#34; Young wrote. &#34;They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.&#34;</p>
<h2>Young thanks Warner for backing him</h2>
<p>Young posted an <a href="https://neilyoungarchives.com/news/1/article?id=Spotify-In-The-Name-Of-Truth">update today</a> thanking Warner. &#34;I want to thank my truly great and supportive record company Warner Brothers-Reprise Records, for standing with me in my decision to pull all my music from Spotify. Thank You!&#34; Young wrote. Young said this is &#34;a huge loss for my record company to absorb&#34; given that &#34;Spotify represents 60 percent of the streaming of my music to listeners around the world.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;I could not continue to support Spotify&#39;s life-threatening misinformation to the music loving public... Spotify has become the home of life-threatening COVID misinformation. Lies being sold for money,&#34; Young also wrote.                                            </p>
                                                        
<p>Young wrote that before he went public about wanting his music off Spotify, &#34;I was reminded by my own legal forces that, contractually, I did not have the control of my music to do that. I announced I was leaving anyway because I knew I was. I was prepared to do all I could and more just to make sure that happened.&#34;</p>
<p>Young, a long-time <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/02/pono-player-review-a-tall-refreshing-drink-of-snake-oil/">proponent of high-resolution music files</a>, also wrote that &#34;many other platforms, Amazon, Apple, and Qobuz, to name a few, present my music today in all its High-Resolution glory—the way it is intended to be heard, while unfortunately Spotify continues to peddle the lowest quality in music reproduction. So much for art.&#34;</p>
<h2>Open letter slammed Spotify for hosting Rogan</h2>
<p>Young&#39;s action came shortly after hundreds of scientists, professors, doctors, and healthcare workers wrote an <a href="https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/">open letter to Spotify</a> about Rogan&#39;s podcast. They wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Joe Rogan has repeatedly spread misleading and false claims on his podcast, provoking distrust in science and medicine. He has <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/joe-rogan-slammed-for-deeply-irresponsible-anti-vaccine-comments/">discouraged</a> vaccination in young people and children, <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/aug/31/joe-rogan/joe-rogan-falsely-says-mrna-vaccines-are-gene-ther/">incorrectly</a> claimed that mRNA vaccines are &#34;gene therapy,&#34; promoted off-label use of <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/joe-rogan-covid19-misinformation-ivermectin-spotify-podcast-1219976/">ivermectin</a> to treat COVID-19 (contrary to FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19">warnings</a>), and spread a number of unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. In episode #1757, Rogan hosted Dr. Robert Malone, who was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2021/12/31/prominant-virologist-kicked-off-twitter-for-spreading-anti-vaxx-video-15844655/">suspended</a> from Twitter for spreading misinformation about COVID-19.</p>
<p>Dr. Malone used the JRE [Joe Rogan Experience] platform to further promote numerous baseless claims, including several <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unbiasedscipod/p/CYT5hwmL4ND/?utm_medium=copy_link">falsehoods</a> about COVID-19 vaccines and an <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-health-joe-rogan-ap-fact-check-a87b1044c6256968dcc33886a36c949f">unfounded</a> theory that societal leaders have &#34;hypnotized&#34; the public. Many of these statements have already been <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/covid-psychosis-theory-joe-rogan-b1989552.html">discredited</a>. Notably, Dr. Malone is one of two recent JRE guests who has compared pandemic policies to the <a href="https://healthfeedback.org/claimreview/joe-rogan-interview-with-peter-mccullough-contains-multiple-false-and-unsubstantiated-claims-about-the-covid-19-pandemic-and-vaccines/">Holocaust</a>. These actions are not only objectionable and offensive, but also medically and culturally dangerous.</p></blockquote>
