    <p>How high is the stress I am talking about? You are commuting all you think is that you might snap today, you might quit today. That is what I am calling a high-stress work environment. You know after a certain point the job becomes disposable and you are making a list in your head of who you are going to say &#34;fuck you&#34; to as you storm out of the building.</p>
<p>The reality in this environment is that everyone is stressed and you are not unique. The person pressing you is being pressed on by another guy. Everyone hates their job and everyone likes the movie &#34;Office Space&#34; daydreaming about quitting and dating Jennifer Aniston, who happens to be beautiful but stupid enough to not see that.</p>
<p>The reality is that if you quit, you DO NEED these connections to get a new job in the form of a recommendation. Do not snap at people. You may think the job is disposable, but the reality is that the memory is not. You will always be &#34;that guy&#34;. You will always be the person who said &#34;fuck you&#34; to them, even though you were both in a pile of shit neck-deep.</p>
<p>So, prioritize relationships. If you are doing something, forget about deadlines or significance, think of the other person who is begging you and how it impacts them. Every relationship is a human relationship, so do not let the &#34;professional environment&#34; corrupt that.</p>
