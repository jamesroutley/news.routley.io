    <h1>Alpine Linux: Brilliant Linux Distro</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="mw-content-text" lang="en" dir="ltr"><div><p>Alpine Linux is <b>designed for power users, with security, simplicity and resource efficiency in mind.</b>
</p><p>Alpine is the <b>OS</b> (<b>O</b>perating <b>S</b>ystem), that runs on your <b>machine</b>. Programs such as a web browser run on the OS, and web pages like &#34;wiki.alpinelinux.org&#34; are handled by the web browser.
</p><p>Keep in mind that today <b>due to the great popularity of Docker, Alpine Linux is one of the most deployed operating systems currently in use,</b> because within every other operating system that uses docker, the docker image it uses is almost always Alpine Linux.
</p>



<p>Alpine Linux is different from most other Linux distros in a few ways:
</p>
<ol><li>it is built around <b>musl libc</b>, not glibc, which means there might be incompatibilites with some packages</li>
<li>its main utilities (<b>coreutils</b>) are derived from <b>busybox</b> and <b>suckless</b>, but GNU coreutils can be installed</li>
<li>it uses a <b>hardened Linux kernel</b> by default, but offers an optional <b>vanilla original kernel</b> for desktop users</li>
<li>it compiles all userspace binaries as position-independent executables with stack-smashing protection</li></ol>
<p>In next sections you will find general information necessary to start in the Alpine powered world for a new user.

<h2><span id="Installation">Installation</span></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_newbie_installation" title="Alpine newbie installation">Alpine newbie installation</a> wiki page is focused on the idea to cover popular quick cases such as ARM, i386 and AMD64 that only offer the ready-to-use installation, that is, cases where only alpine will be the OS to install, in order to understand it faster, once understood, you can play and deep more granular over your preferred install.
</p><p><b>For more granular, advanced or more specific cases you will have to read the official installation wiki page</b> at <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Installation" title="Installation">Installation</a>. Its more recommended you first use an alpine virtual-box install and understand the system before try more deep install process, that is why we offered in newbie category the <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_newbie_installation" title="Alpine newbie installation">Alpine newbie installation</a> wiki pages!

<h2><span id="Post_install_and_Software_Packages">Post install and Software Packages</span></h2>
<p><b>See: <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Post_installation" title="Post installation">Post installation</a></b>
</p><p>The programs, the <b>software installed to Alpine comes from two places: repositories</b> (those managed by Alpine) <b>and original upstream sources</b> (those compiled as Unix-like traditional way).
</p><p>Alpine software repositories are managed by the repositories and uses packages. Each Alpine release have two branch of repositories. The <b>/community</b> repository of each Alpine release contains community supported packages that were accepted from the <b>/edge</b> repository. Only <b>/main</b> repository of each version of Alpine release are supported for Main Alpine Developers and Man Powers and received official support by almost few years until new releases happened.
</p>
<ul><li><b>main</b>: Main packages are the Alpine package software that have direct support and updates from the Alpine core and main team, also have official special documentation. Are always available for all releases and will have almost substitutions if some are not continued from upstream. Commonly those packages are selected due their responsibility and stability respect upstream availability. Those are in <i>testing</i> and when performs well or are mature goes to <i>main</i> branch.</li>
<li><b>community</b>: community packages are those made by users in team with the official developers and well near integrated to the Alpine packages. They are supported by those user contributions and could end if the user also ends respect with Alpine work, by example could not have substitution in next release due lack of support by upstream author. Those are in <i>testing</i> and when accepted goes to <i>community</i> branch.</li>
<li><b>edge</b>: New packages come into testing repositories of edge Alpine version and are those made by any contributor or man power on Alpine, the edge is unstable current development, this branch of repository has no release linked or related of Alpine. Those are in <i>testing</i> and when accepted goes to <i>community</i>.</li></ul>
<h4><span id="APK_and_package_formats">APK and package formats</span></h4>
<p><b>Software packages for Alpine Linux</b> are digitally signed tar.gz archives containing programs, configuration files, and dependency metadata. They have the extension <code>.apk</code> (yes, please don&#39;t confused with Androit ones), and are often called &#34;a-packs&#34;.
</p><p>Are managed with the <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Package_management" title="Package management">apk</a> command, located at <code>/sbin/apk</code>, it uses <code>/etc/apk/</code> place for the configurations files, and stores all downloaded &#34;a-packs&#34; files in <code>/etc/apk/cache</code> from the repositories before unpacks and put the package files compiled into the installed system.
</p><p>As new user those technical tips are not necessary now, you can read the <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_newbie_apk_packages" title="Alpine newbie apk packages">Alpine newbie apk packages</a> page to just read all about packages install only.. for more deep in advanced: those technical topic are in the <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_package_management" title="Alpine Linux package management">apk</a> wiki official page.
</p>
<h2><span id="Developer">Developer</span></h2>
<p>In earlier days, Alpine used a separate Gentoo build environment. Nowadays we can build in Alpine environment itself.
</p><p>There&#39;s many kind of developers.. more are <b>Distro targeted</b> (like Alpine package development), others web oriented as <b>Front-end web development or a Back-End Web Developer</b> (like webpage design or applications services) , and others <b>DevOps</b> (backend programming and/or software development (Dev) and information-technology operations (Ops))
</p><p>In <b>DevOps and/or Web Development</b>, Whatever will be, <b>installation of the devel tools are the next step</b>: the <span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=alpine-sdk&amp;branch=edge&amp;repo=&amp;arch=x86_64&amp;maintainer=">alpine-sdk</a></span> is a metapackage that pulls in the most essential packages used to development environments; Also the <span><a rel="nofollow" href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=crosstool-ng&amp;branch=edge&amp;repo=&amp;arch=x86_64&amp;maintainer=">crosstool-ng</a></span> if you will setup different architectures or cross-compiling.
</p><p>For <b>development of packages</b>.. there&#39;s two branchs: using the Alpine edge branch or using the Alpine stable, the only difference are the target, edge used the most up to date but not well tested software packages and the results are for the next Alpine releases. The recommendation to develop packages for newbies, are using <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux_in_a_chroot" title="Alpine Linux in a chroot">Alpine Linux in a chroot</a>, later when users got more experience.. must move to others way to develop packages.. at the actual status of a newbie it&#39;s the most easy and faster way.
</p><p>All the Development process are detailed for newbie users in the <a href="https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Alpine_newbie_developer" title="Alpine newbie developer">Alpine newbie developer</a> page.
