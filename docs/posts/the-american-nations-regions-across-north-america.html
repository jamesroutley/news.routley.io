<p>The book the model is based on, <a data-cke-saved-href="https://colinwoodard.com/books/american-nations/" href="https://colinwoodard.com/books/american-nations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>American Nations,</em></a> is a history of the entire continent north of the 25th parallel, including what’s now Canada and northern Mexico. Until now, I’d never had a proper map of what that looks like, facilitating research across borders. The map’s been popular with the public as well, with <a data-cke-saved-href="https://www.nationhoodlab.org/the-american-nations-regions-across-north-america/" href="https://www.nationhoodlab.org/the-american-nations-regions-across-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the post</a> introducing it garnering unprecedented organic internet traffic. </p>
<p><span>Note Spanish Caribbean’s extension to the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. The region probably includes parts of the “Spanish Main” — the </span><span>northern, Caribbean coast of South America — and maybe some other island locations as well, but, it being peripheral to our core study area in North America, I haven’t done the research into all that. First Nation, of course, includes Greenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. </span></p>
<p><span>Central and Southern Mexico likely belong to “post-Aztec” and “Maya” regional cultures, the latter extending into parts of Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. Someday, hopefully in collaboration with regional experts, maybe there will be a South American Nations map as well. </span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to my counterparts at <a href="https://www.motivf.com/">Motivf</a>, John Liberty (who created the map) and Tova Pearlman (who helped wrangle some of the underlying data.) Enjoy.</span></p>
