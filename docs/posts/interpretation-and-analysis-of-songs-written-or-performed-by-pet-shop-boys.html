  <p>This website has no &#34;official&#34; 
    connection to the Pet Shop Boys. It merely presents my own personal commentary—often 
    including attempted explanations and interpretations—on the songs of my favorite 
    contemporary pop band. Of course, this commentary has often been influenced by 
    what the Pet Shop Boys themselves, <b>Chris Lowe</b> and <b>Neil Tennant</b>, have said about 
    their music and by what others have previously written. Nevertheless, many of 
    the observations I make here are original with me. </p>
  <p>By no means am I suggesting 
    that these are the &#34;only&#34; or &#34;correct&#34; interpretations. In 
    fact, it&#39;s typical of great art, even great <b>pop</b> art, to lend itself to 
    multiple interpretations. And I do consider the Pet Shop Boys to be the creators 
    of great pop art. So you can take or leave my interpretations as you wish. If 
    you disagree, please don&#39;t take offense. Rather, enjoy the fact that we&#39;re both 
    fans of music rich enough to invite different interpretations. </p>
  <p>Despite my best efforts, I have no doubt that I&#39;m guilty of at least some factual 
    errors. I recognize this fact and apologize in advance for any that may have slipped 
    past me. I&#39;ll certainly correct any errors that come to my attention.<a name="securityNote" id="securityNote"></a></p>
