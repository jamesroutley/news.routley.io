<p><strong>Yesterday</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>First day of RC. Took a more low-stress approach by focusing on meeting people and figuring out how to make the best use of my time here.</li>
<li>Got back into Full Stack open course and finished up the last exercise of part 2 (https://github.com/justcho5/fullstackopen).</li>
<li>Chatted with @<strong>John Isak Texas Falk (he) (W1&#39;23)</strong> @<strong>RÃ©gis Schiavi (he) (W2&#39;24)</strong> about software engineering vs data science, ML, DL</li>
<li>Chatted with @<strong>Christopher Mischaikow (he) (W2&#39;24)</strong> about our projects going into RC, chatgpt, prompt engineering, making a personal website</li>
<li>Started my first ever <a href="https://justinacho.bearblog.dev/first-day-of-rc/">blog</a> in an attempt to keep myself accountable and just be more open to others :see_no_evil: Not sure yet whether this will be more a weekly reflections blog or a daily notes blog</li>
<li>Thought about some project ideas :thinking_face_3d:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Today</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get through at least half of part 3 (Node.js section) of FullStackOpen</li>
<li><del>Start repo for personal website. Been hard to start this. I have a design and plan to use React but have had a hard time knowing where to start. Time to figure it out.</del></li>
<li><del>Chats with @<strong>Mani Sundararajan (he) (W2&#39;24)</strong> and @<strong>Ivy Wong (they) (W2&#39;24)</strong></del></li>
<li>Get through Trees section of Leetcode DSA crash course</li>
<li><del>Whatever else RC has in store today :blush:</del></li>
</ul>

<p>Hello World,</p>
<p>Today was a busy day and I&#39;m not really sure where all the time went. Spent a lot of time meeting new people and didn&#39;t get as much done as I had hope, but that&#39;s okay! I figured that the first week would be pretty hectic and a time of discovery. Despite not getting through some of my to-do&#39;s, I still discussed project ideas with Mani Sundararajan and Rhea Karty, as well as had a unexpectedly long but fun! convo with Ivy Wong. We talked about doing weekly pairing on mini-projects and getting a JS/TS group going. I&#39;m pretty introverted/anxious so I was worried to be the meeting organizer but when at Recurse?!? haha.. I&#39;m confident the meetings will be more a group effort and not what I&#39;m fearing which is leading the meetings &gt;&lt; Either way, very excited to keep developing relationships and working together with the other Recursers. Tomorrow is probably another day filled with more 1-on-1s! Why is everyone so interesting??</p>
<p>Things I learned today:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta&#39;s MMS speech recognition model. Don&#39;t know a lot about it right now but could be interesting to incorporate in a future project.</li>
<li>some basic Node.js and Express</li>
<li>Chatgpt vision API. Need to look more into this</li>
</ul>
<p>Love,</p>
<p>Justina</p>
