Its 4-shade display was technically no match for Game Gear’s 4,096-color backlit display. Its processor had a quarter the power of the Atari Lynx. How did Game Boy win?</p></div></div></div><div><p><img src="https://d2kq0urxkarztv.cloudfront.net/616f05008e9fa70027fff38e/3331466/upload-0672a187-bb5e-48c0-b34a-eea7d6a525a7.png"/></p></div></div>

The patented design includes a down-facing hemisphere to act as a fulcrum and silicone pads to provide a soft click feeling. This interface became so fundamental to the modern gaming experience that Nintendo was presented an Emmy at CES ’08 for the design.</p></div></div></div><div><div data-id="61c9c5b22145e8002cf052ac"><div><p>Here is the LR35902 processor, running at just 4 MHz. Based on the Intel 8080 and Zilog Z80, the technology was already 10+ years old at the time of the Game Boy’s release — this minimized cost and maximized developer familiarity. The processor is similar, if not slower, than those in calculators such as the TI-83.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="61cca49494627d001f05d0f3"><div><p><span>Fun fact: according to Michael Johas Teener, former chair of the FireWire working group, the connector design of Game Boy’s link cable inspired that of the original FireWire connector.</span></p></div></div></div>
