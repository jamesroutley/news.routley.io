      <b>DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE IRISH TAKEOVER RULES</b>
    </p>
    <p>
Under Rule 8.3(a) of the Irish Takeover Rules, any person who is &#39;interested&#39; in 1% or more of any class of &#39;relevant securities&#39; of the Company or a securities exchange offeror (being any offeror other than an offeror which has announced that its offer is, or is likely to be, solely in cash) must make an &#39;opening position disclosure&#39; following the commencement of the &#39;offer period&#39; and, if later, following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified. An &#39;opening position disclosure&#39; must contain, among other things, details of the person&#39;s &#39;interests&#39; and &#39;short positions&#39; in any &#39;relevant securities&#39; of each of (i) the Company and (ii) any securities exchange offeror(s). An &#39;opening position disclosure&#39; by a person to whom Rule 8.3(a) applies must be made by no later than 3:30 pm (New York time) on the day that is ten &#39;business days&#39; following the commencement of the ‘offer period’ and, if appropriate, by no later than 3:30 pm (New York time) on the day that is ten &#39;business days&#39; following the announcement in which any securities exchange offeror is first identified.

</p>
    <p>
Under Rule 8.3(b) of the Irish Takeover Rules, if any person is, or becomes, ‘interested’ (directly or indirectly) in 1% or more of any class of ‘relevant securities’ of the Company, all ‘dealings’ in any ‘relevant securities’ of the Company or any securities exchange offeror (including by means of an option in respect of, or a derivative referenced to, any such ‘relevant securities’) must be publicly disclosed by not later than 3:30 pm (New York time) on the ‘business day’ following the date of the relevant transaction. This requirement will continue until the ‘offer period’ ends. If two or more persons cooperate on the basis of any agreement either express or tacit, either oral or written, to acquire an ‘interest’ in ‘relevant securities’ of the Company, they will be deemed to be a single person for the purpose of Rule 8.3 of the Irish Takeover Rules. A disclosure table, giving details of the companies in whose ‘relevant securities’ ‘dealings’ should be disclosed can be found on the Irish Takeover Panel&#39;s website at <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtakeoverpanel.ie&amp;esheet=53556170&amp;newsitemid=20230917756751&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie&amp;index=1&amp;md5=92bbe6038180ef65919ad04921e0fec8" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie</a>.

</p>
    <p>
In general, interests in securities arise when a person has long economic exposure, whether conditional or absolute, to changes in the price of the securities. In particular, a person will be treated as having an ‘interest’ by virtue of the ownership or control of securities, or by virtue of any option in respect of, or derivative referenced to, securities.

</p>
    <p>
Terms in quotation marks are defined in the Irish Takeover Rules, which can be found on the Irish Takeover Panel&#39;s website. If you are in any doubt as to whether or not you are required to disclose a ’dealing’ under Rule 8, please consult the Irish Takeover Panel&#39;s website at <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtakeoverpanel.ie&amp;esheet=53556170&amp;newsitemid=20230917756751&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie&amp;index=2&amp;md5=0cd9c16cc6e7bd34875376c2225adbca" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">www.irishtakeoverpanel.ie</a> or contact the Irish Takeover Panel at telephone number +353 1 678 9020.
