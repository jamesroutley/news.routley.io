        The Voder was an early attempt at speech synthesis developed by Bell
        Telephone Laboratory for the 1939-40 New York World&#39;s Fair. Controlled
        by hand, the operator manually forms each syllable using complex button
        sequences and it would take about a year of practice to able to
        produce fluid speech.
      </p>
      <p>
        Helen Harper was one of the first people to figure out how to operate
        the Voder effectively, and was the live demonstrator at the World&#39;s
        Fair. She later went on to form a year-long course instructing women to
        use the Voder. Of 100 applied students, only 20 were able to graduate
        and match Harper&#39;s skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        This application puts you in the shoes of the few women capable of
        operating the Voder.

        Try create vowel formants pressing the button combinations below on
        your keyboard, or if you are using a mobile device scroll down and tap
        console display:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><kbd>D + V + J</kbd>: [ɑ] as in &#34;father&#34;</li>
        <li><kbd>A + K</kbd>: [ē] as in &#34;heed&#34;</li>
        <li><kbd>A + D</kbd>: [ōō] as in &#34;pool&#34;</li>
        <li><kbd>Space</kbd>: unvoiced noise</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Replicating the sequence &#34;She saw me&#34; like in the video above
        requires the following inputs with exact timing; experiment until it
        sounds right to you. The results will not sound exactly like the video
        because of subtle articulations the operator is performing for
        inflection and dynamics.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>“She (shē)</dt>
        <dd>
          <ol>
            <li><kbd>Space</kbd>: [sh]</li>
            <li><kbd>A + K</kbd>: [ē]</li>
          </ol>
        </dd>
        <dt>saw (sô)</dt>
        <dd>
          <ol>
            <li><kbd>Space</kbd>: [s]</li>
            <li><kbd>D + V + J</kbd>: [ô]</li>
          </ol>
        </dd>
        <dt>me.” (mē)</dt>
        <dd>
          <ol>
            <li><kbd>A</kbd>: [m]</li>
            <li><kbd>A + K</kbd>: [ē]</li>
          </ol>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        After you get the hang of the former example, try saying
        &#34;She seesaws&#34; by resequencing some of the formants.
