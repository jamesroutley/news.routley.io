    <h1>Awkwardness</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>This week I&#39;ve been feeling more socially awkward than I have ever before. Don&#39;t get me wrong: it has been a great week in most respects. But I&#39;ve also spent time crying in the bathroom a few hours ago because I get everything wrong.</p>
<p>Where is this coming from? I try to be a very sociable person, and most people might know me as exactly that. But, as most of my closest friends would know, I&#39;m actually also very timid at times and need a lot of time for myself—my significant other excluded.</p>
<p>I try to be as open about this as I can be, but a lot of the times people don&#39;t believe me. For some time there was a meme going on in my friend circle: “Veit doesn&#39;t want to have fun”. It was pretty funny for some time, and I participated in spinning the meme. But what most people didn&#39;t realize was that just because it was funny doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t true.</p>
<p>Over the years I developed a bunch of mechanisms to cope with that dichotomy of wanting to be social and not actually having a very high tolerance for social activites. It ranges from the classic “I have headphones on and I can&#39;t hear you right now (but it&#39;s not actually playing anything)” to the relatively new “staying in my room with the lights out for prolonged periods”.</p>
<p>These cool-down periods seem to have been a lot more necessary as of late, namely since I&#39;ve arrived at NYC. Why is that? It&#39;s simple, really: my formulae don&#39;t work anymore.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve become a super apologetic, over-reflective mental wreck a lot of the times when I have to socialize. This hasn&#39;t been true for a few occasions, but I&#39;ve largely felt that way when interacting. I constantly feel like I&#39;m doing something wrong, because the social cues I receive here bear an uncanny resemblance to the ones I&#39;m used to, but they&#39;re different enough for me to feel like the odd one; I don&#39;t know when or when not to speak, and I certainly don&#39;t know how to start a conversation properly.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think most people think much of it, mind, or even notice. But I do. I know who I am, and I know I&#39;m not the person I have been for the past week. I&#39;ve inserted myself into conversations I have no room in. I have frantically tried to do every social activity I could, just to break the ice somehow, and I feel like the ice only exists in my mind.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve said I want to be open, and I think this might be the most blunt, open, and hard to write post I&#39;ve ever written. I&#39;ve not only written it for myself, though. I&#39;ve written it for everyone who has been over-analyzing every encounter they had so far. I&#39;ve written it for all of the odd folks. If you didn&#39;t know already: you&#39;re not alone. I feel like RC, probably even the “real world” is full of these people, and we all feel that way sometimes. But I also think that this is hard to acknowledge when you&#39;re in “your zone”, because your anxieties don&#39;t want you to see that. I think being upfront and open about that is the best way to tackle this, even if it makes you feel weak or wimpy. You&#39;re certainly not, or else it wouldn&#39;t be that hard.</p>
<p>I will try not to talk that much about feelings anymore in the future, because I actually want to talk about cool tech stuff in this blog. I will also try to be less apologetic about myself in the future; sorry for the rant.</p>
