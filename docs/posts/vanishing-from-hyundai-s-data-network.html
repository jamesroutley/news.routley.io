    <h1>Vanishing from Hyundai’s data network</h1>

The Yuppie Button page talks about making lots of light. 
Now I needed to do the opposite, by &#34;going dark&#34; -- to vanish completely
from Hyundai&#39;s data network, and avoid having the car being tracked
or actively interfered with outside of my control. 
See, this is one of the showstopping problems I have with Tesla -- they
*insist* that you have your car online all the time, talking to Tesla&#39;s
cloud and sending telematic data. 
Thank you, NO. 
The <a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/bluelink/index.aspx">
range of things</a>
that Hyundai&#39;s BlueLink setup is able to
do remotely to someone&#39;s car given only a VIN is totally scary. 
Not only did I want no parts of that, we all have every right to not
participate in that nonsense if we so choose.
<p>

As a first step I refused to let the dealer sign me for BlueLink, telling
them that I could handle signup later myself if I wanted to. 
But I knew there was more to it, since the car as it came was still able
to make a cellular data connection and send information about itself. 
The obvious question was to find and disable the cellular communication
facility, or &#34;telematics unit&#34; as it is implemented in many vehicles.
