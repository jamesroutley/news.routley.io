This chipset contains multiple components, one of them being the main CPU. The rest are at the CPU disposal to speed up certain tasks.</p><h3 id="the-leader">The leader</h3><p>The main core is a <strong>MIPS R5900-compatible</strong> CPU with lots of enhancements. This is the first chip that starts executing instructions after the console is turned on. The processor provides the following features:</p><ul><li><strong>MIPS III ISA</strong>: A 64-bit RISC instruction set. <em>Wait, is it me or this is the same ISA found on a <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#cpu">competitor’s console</a>?</em>. Not quite, Sony enhanced the ISA by adding some instructions from <strong>MIPS IV</strong> (prefetch and conditional move) along with their own SIMD extension called <strong>multimedia instructions</strong>.</li><li><strong>32 128-bit extra registers</strong>: Another enhancement. They are better managed using multimedia instructions and are very useful for vector processing.<ul><li>These registers are accessed through a 128-bit bus, while the rest of the CPU uses an internal 64-bit bus.</li></ul></li><li><strong>2-way superscalar</strong>: Up to two instructions are executed in parallel.</li><li><strong>24 KB L1 cache</strong>: Divided into 16 KB for instructions and 8 KB for data.<ul><li>It also implements a <strong>prefetch function</strong> to cache instructions and data before they are requested. This is done by including extra circuitry that can identify which places in memory are more often requested.</li></ul></li><li><strong>16 KB of Scratchpad RAM</strong>: Also known as ‘Fast RAM’.</li><li><strong>Memory management unit</strong>: Interfaces memory access with the rest of the system.</li></ul><p>The core is complemented with a <strong>dedicated floating point unit</strong> (identified as ‘COP1’) that accelerates operations with 32-bit floating-point numbers (also known as <code>floats</code> in C). This is a peculiar block as it doesn’t follow the IEEE 754 standard, most evident with its absence of <code>infinity</code> (computed as <code>0</code> instead) <sup id="bibref:2"><a href="#bib:cpu-krysto" role="doc-biblioref">[2]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="a-recognisable-memory-choice">A recognisable memory choice</h3><p>Next to the Emotion Engine are two blocks of 16 MB of RAM, giving a total of <strong>32 MB</strong> of main memory. The type of memory used is <strong>RDRAM</strong> (<a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/#memory-design"><em>déjà vu!</em></a>) which is accessed through a 16-bit bus.</p><div><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/MemoryArch.b34c74b38be1ed34237a641ee12d48fafbb98ad28688c4ebb79fc723d8e0ab24.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="605" height="269" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/MemoryArch.b34c74b38be1ed34237a641ee12d48fafbb98ad28688c4ebb79fc723d8e0ab24.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Memory design of the Emotion Engine. You can guess where the congestion will emerge.</figcaption></figure><p>At first, this can be a little disappointing to hear, considering the internal bus of the Emotion engine is as wide as 128 bits. However, the RAM chips are strategically placed by following the <strong>dual-channel architecture</strong>, which consists in connecting both chips using two independent 16-bit buses (one bus per chip) to improve data throughput. The resulting setup provides a theoretical 3.2 GB/sec, so rest assured that memory latency is not an issue in this console!</p></div><p>At one corner of the Emotion engine there is a powerful <strong>DMA Controller</strong> or ‘DMAC’ that transfers data between main memory and Scratchpad; or between main memory and any component inside the EE.</p><p>Data transfers are done in batches of 128-bits, but here is the interesting part: Every eight batches, the main bus is temporarily unlocked. This leaves a small window to perform other DMA transfers in parallel (up to ten) or let the CPU use the main bus. This <em>modus operandi</em> is called <strong>slice mode</strong> and is one of the many modes available on this DMA unit. Bear in mind that while slice mode reduces stalls on the main bus, it does so at the cost of slowing down the overall DMA transfer.</p><h3 id="preventing-past-mishaps">Preventing past mishaps</h3><p>Whether we want it or not, with the amount of traffic happening inside the Emotion Engine, this design will eventually suffer the consequences of the <strong>Unified memory architecture</strong> or ‘UMA’. That is… multiple independent components trying to access main memory at the same time, causing congestion. Well, to correct these issues, Sony alleviated the constant need for memory by:</p><ul><li>Wrapping their processors with <strong>lots of cache</strong>. Thus, only requiring access to main memory if it’s absolutely necessary.<ul><li>99% of cache/scratchpad mentions in this article will be for this reason.</li></ul></li><li>Adding a 128-byte <strong>Write Back Buffer</strong>: Very similar to the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/gamecube/#ibms-enhancements">Write Gather Pipe</a>, but instead of waiting until it’s 25% full, it will check the state of the bus (i.e congested or free) first.</li></ul><p>This sounds very convenient for applications that can benefit from cache, but what about those tasks, such as manipulating Display Lists, which shouldn’t use cache at all? Luckily, the CPU provides a different memory access mode called <strong>UnCached</strong>, which <strong>only</strong> uses the Write Back Buffer. Thus, it will not waste cycles correcting the cache (product of <em>cache misses</em>).</p><p>Furthermore, the <strong>UnCached accelerated mode</strong> is also available. This one adds a buffer for speeding up the read of continuous addresses in memory.</p><h3 id="other-interesting-bits">Other interesting bits</h3><p>Inside the same Emotion Engine package, there is yet-another processor called <strong>Image Processing Unit</strong> or ‘IPU’, this time designed for <strong>image decompression</strong>. As the successor of the <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/playstation/#tab-2-3-motion-decoder">MDEC</a>, the IPU can be useful when a game needs to decode an MPEG2 movie without jamming the main CPU.</p><p>Long story short, the game sends compressed image streams to the IPU (hopefully using DMA) which are then decoded in a format that the GPU can display. The PS2’s operating system also relies on the IPU to provide DVD playback.</p><p>Finally, the IPU also operates compressed <strong>High-resolution textures</strong>, which saves CPU usage and reduces large transfers.</p><hr/><h2 id="co-cpus">Co CPUs</h2><p>It’s been two years since the rivals presented their <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/dreamcast/">latest offering</a>. If you read the former article and just started reading this one, I presume you are <em>still</em> waiting for ‘the thing’ that makes the PS2 as powerful as it seemed back then. Now, let me introduce a <em>very</em> important set of components Sony fitted in the Emotion Engine, the <strong>Vector Processing Units</strong> or ‘VPU’.</p><h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3><p>A Vector Processing Unit is a small independent processor designed to operate vectors, in particular, vectors made of four <code>floats</code>. These processors are so fast that they only spend <strong>one cycle per operation</strong>, which can be extremely convenient for geometry processing. Though they exhibit similar unstandardised behaviour to the CPU’s FPU.</p><p>VPUs are made of the following components:</p><ul><li>Some <strong>Vector Unit Memory</strong> or ‘VU Mem’: Used as a working space for the Vector unit. It stores values needed to be operated and/or the results of previous operations.</li><li>A <strong>Vector Unit</strong>: The core of the processor. It contains some memory (called <strong>Micro Memory</strong>) to store a program (called <strong>Microprogram</strong>) which instructs the unit on how to operate the data found in ‘VU Mem’.<ul><li>It implements a <strong>64-bit ISA</strong> and the execution unit is <strong>split into two parallel sub-units</strong>. The first one multiplies or adds floats, while the other one divides floats or operates integers. This enables to operate both floats and integers <strong>concurrently</strong>.</li></ul></li><li>A <strong>Vector Interface</strong>: Automatically decompresses vertex data coming from main memory in a format the Vector unit can understand. This unit can also transfer microprograms to Micro Memory.</li></ul><h3 id="functionality">Functionality</h3><p>To start working, the vector unit needs to be ‘kickstarted’. For this, the main CPU is in charge of supplying the microcode.</p><p>There are <strong>two VPUs</strong> fitted in the Emotion engine, but they are arranged differently, giving way to different uses and optimisations.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-1-1-vector-processing-unit-0-link"><a href="#tab-1-1-vector-processing-unit-0">Vector Processing Unit 0</a></li><li id="tab-1-2-vector-processing-unit-1-link"><a href="#tab-1-2-vector-processing-unit-1">Vector Processing Unit 1</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-1-1-vector-processing-unit-0"><h4 id="tab-1-1-vector-processing-unit-0">Vector Processing Unit 0</h4><figure><a href="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/VU0.300aa8f5034941872e5a56f84ab61dfa3f3b2c71ede208b85d7edc99e6dd38a5.png"><picture><img alt="Image" width="881" height="429" src="https://www.copetti.org/images/consoles/ps2/VU0.300aa8f5034941872e5a56f84ab61dfa3f3b2c71ede208b85d7edc99e6dd38a5.png" loading="lazy"/></picture></a><figcaption>Architecture of VPU0.</figcaption></figure><p>The first VPU, the <strong>VPU0</strong>, is positioned between the CPU and the other vector unit (VPU1). It provides an ‘assisting’ role to the main CPU.</p><p>The VPU0 has two modes of operation:</p><ul><li><strong>Micromode</strong>: This is the ‘traditional mode’. The VPU will independently execute ‘microinstructions’ from a microprogram stored in Micro memory.</li><li><strong>Macromode</strong>: The VPU0 becomes the ‘COP2’ of the main CPU and executes ‘macro-instructions’, received from the main CPU through a dedicated 128-bit bus.<ul><li>Macro-instructions have the same functionality as microinstructions but use different opcodes. Nonetheless, the VPU execution unit is no longer split (meaning it can only execute one instruction at a time).</li><li>While this mode doesn’t make full utilisation of all the components of the VPU0, it still speeds up the CPU’s vector operations. Moreover, in terms of simplicity, a co-processor is easier to program than an independent unit (something PC programmers will find helpful).</li></ul></li></ul><p>The memory map of the VPU0 also has access to some of the other VPU’s registers and flags, presumably to check its state or quickly read the results of some operations done by the other VPU.</p><div><p><a rel="nofollow">« Previous</a>

Moreover, this unit includes an additional component called <strong>Elementary function unit</strong> or ‘EFU’ which speeds up the execution of exponential and trigonometric functions.</p><p>The VPU1 is located between the VPU0 and the Graphics Interface (the ‘gate’ to the GPU), so it includes additional buses to feed the geometry to the GPU as quickly as possible and without using the main bus.</p><p>On the other side and due to its location, the VPU1 <strong>only operates in micromode</strong>.</p><p>It’s obvious that this VPU was designed for trigonometric operations, and may serve as a pre-processor for the GPU. Hence, it’s often put in charge of delivering the famous Display Lists.</p><div><p><a rel="nofollow">« Previous</a>
<a rel="nofollow">Next »</a></p></div></div></div></div><h3 id="infinite-worlds">Infinite worlds</h3><p>A useful approach that can be exploited with these units is <strong>procedural generation</strong>. In other words, instead of building the scene using hard-coded geometry, let the VPUs generate it using algorithms. In this case, the VPU computes <strong>mathematical functions to produce the geometry</strong> which is then interpreted by the GPU (i.e. triangles, lines, quadrangles, etc) and ultimately used to draw the scene.</p><p>Compared to using explicit data, procedural content is ideal for parallelised tasks, it frees up bandwidth, requires very little storage and it’s dynamic (programmers can set parameters to achieve different results) <sup id="bibref:3"><a href="#bib:cpu-green" role="doc-biblioref">[3]</a></sup>. Many areas can highly benefit from this technique:</p><ul><li><strong>Complex surfaces</strong> (e.g. spheres and wheels).</li><li><strong>World rendering</strong> (e.g terrains, particles, trees).</li><li><strong>Bezier curves</strong> (a very popular equation in computer graphics which is used to draw curves), these are turned into a <strong>Bezier patch</strong> (explicit geometry) and support different degrees of precision based on the level of detail required.</li></ul><p>On the other side, procedural content may struggle with animations and, if the algorithm is too complex, the VPU might not generate the geometry at the required time.</p><p>To sum up, procedural rendering is not a new technique, but thanks to the VPUs, it opens the doors to further optimisations and richer graphics. Nonetheless, is not a simple technique to implement and Sony R&amp;D published various papers describing different approaches to use on their console <sup id="bibref:4"><a href="#bib:cpu-tumati" role="doc-biblioref">[4]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="you-define-the-workflow">You define the workflow</h3><p>With these new additions, programmers now have a lot of flexibility to design their graphics engines.

The commands specifically used to read the content of a game behave very differently from standard DVD commands (i.e. to read a DVD movie). It turns out authorised games contain an out-of-reach ‘map file’ in the inner section of the disc that indexes the filesystem by name, position and size. When the DVD is asked to read a game disc, it will always navigate through the disc using the map file, meaning that a pirated copy of a game, which could not include the map file, will be impossible to read. This was complemented by a region lock system that prevented imported games from working in a console from a different region.</p></div><h3 id="exploits-discovered">Exploits discovered</h3><p>Having explained the most critical part of this console, let’s take a look at multiple methods discovered that could bypass the protection mechanisms.</p><div><ul><li id="tab-8-1-modchips-link"><a href="#tab-8-1-modchips">Modchips</a></li><li id="tab-8-2-cheats-link"><a href="#tab-8-2-cheats">Cheats</a></li><li id="tab-8-3-disc-swapping-link"><a href="#tab-8-3-disc-swapping">Disc swapping</a></li><li id="tab-8-4-ps1-overflow-link"><a href="#tab-8-4-ps1-overflow">PS1 overflow</a></li></ul><div><div id="tab-8-1-modchips"><h4 id="tab-8-1-modchips">Modchips</h4><p>As any other console of its generation (and previous ones) using disc-based systems, it was a matter of time before third-party companies reversed-engineered the DVD subsystem. The goal here was to find a usable exploit which could force the driver to navigate through the file system without needing an out-of-reach map file.</p><p>This eventually happened in the form of <strong>modchips</strong>, which lifted the region locking restrictions as well.</p><div><p><a rel="nofollow">« Previous</a>
<a rel="nofollow">Next »</a></p></div></div><div id="tab-8-2-cheats"><h4 id="tab-8-2-cheats">Cheats</h4><p>Along with the modchips, which required soldering skills to install, unauthorised but ‘genuine’ discs appeared in the market. These enabled to defeat the region protection and use in-game cheats by patching the OS. Moreover, ‘cheat discs’ had the advantage of not requiring to modify the console. I guess the best example to mention is <em>CodeBreaker</em>.</p><div><p><a rel="nofollow">« Previous</a>
<a rel="nofollow">Next »</a></p></div></div><div id="tab-8-3-disc-swapping"><h4 id="tab-8-3-disc-swapping">Disc swapping</h4><p>In the middle of the latest advancements, yet another trick appeared. This time, exploiting the reader’s handling of faulty sectors. <strong>Swap Magic</strong> looks like another ‘genuine’ disc, but its ‘game’ tells the DVD to read a non-existent executable found on a deliberate faulty sector, halting the driver altogether <sup id="bibref:24"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-hacking" role="doc-biblioref">[24]</a></sup>. This window of opportunity allowed users to swap the disc for a non-genuine one. Then Swap Magic, still loaded in memory, bootstrapped the main executable of the new disc, loading a real game at the end. All of this is carried out while the driver is still thinking a genuine disc is inserted.</p><p>This doesn’t necessarily require altering the console. However, depending on the model, the external case of the PS2 will have to be tampered with to block the eject sensors of the drive. In some cases, placing cotton in certain places will do the trick.</p><div><p><a rel="nofollow">« Previous</a>
<a rel="nofollow">Next »</a></p></div></div><div id="tab-8-4-ps1-overflow"><h4 id="tab-8-4-ps1-overflow">PS1 overflow</h4><p>The PS2 stores a database file called <code>TITLE.DB</code> in MemoryCard which contains information used to optimise the emulation of PS1 games <sup id="bibref:25"><a href="#bib:anti_piracy-grand" role="doc-biblioref">[25]</a></sup>. When a PS1 game is inserted, the OS fetches the database file and loads the whole file in memory at a fixed address (<em>strike one</em>). The information parser is implemented using <strong><code>strncpy()</code></strong>, a function in C that copies strings (chain of characters) from one place to another.</p><p>For people familiar with C, you probably guessed where I’m going. The thing is that <code>strncpy()</code> doesn’t know how long is a string, so unless it’s terminated (by placing <code>\0</code> at the end of the chain) the copy goes on ‘forever’ (with unpredictable results!). Luckily, this function contains an optional parameter that specifies the maximum number of bytes to be copied, protecting the copy from buffer overflows. As ludicrous as it may seem, <strong>Sony didn’t use this parameter</strong>, even though each database entry has a fixed size of 256 bytes (<em>strike two</em>).</p><p>Upon closer inspection in RAM, TITLE.DB happens to be copied <strong>next to a saved register</strong>, <code>$ra</code>, which states the address to return after the current function being executed finishes (<em>strike three</em>) leading up to <strong>The independence exploit</strong>: Craft a Title.db with a large string, embed an executable in it and design that string so <code>$ra</code> will be overridden to point to the executable. If you manage to upload that file to your MemoryCard (through another exploit or a PC USB adapter) you got yourself a simple Homebrew launcher.</p><p>After the slim revision was released, the exploit got patched (<em>I wonder how</em>). Curiously enough, it wasn’t the last <a href="https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/wii/#the-fall-of-encryption">blunder</a> that exposed clumsy code.</p><div><p><a rel="nofollow">« Previous</a>
<a rel="nofollow">Next »</a></p></div></div></div></div><h3 id="a-semi-permanent-software-unlock">A semi-permanent software unlock</h3><p>Some time ago, it was discovered that the BIOS of this console could be upgraded using the Memory Card, this function was never used in practice, but neither was removed (at least during most of the console’s lifespan). With this, hackers realised that if they find a way to install particular software into the MemoryCard, then the BIOS would always load it at boot. This discovery led to <strong>Free MCBoot</strong>, a program presented as ‘upgrade data’ which replaces the original shell with one that can execute <strong>Homebrew</strong>.</p><p>Bear in mind these changes are not permanent, a Memory Card with ‘Free MCBoot’ installed must be inserted prior to the console’s startup. Additionally, this software needs to be installed somehow, so another exploit (e.g. disc swapping) is required to bootstrap the installer.</p><h3 id="more-disc-tricks">More disc tricks</h3><p>The same year after the release of Free MCBoot, another trick was discovered: Disguising games as DVD movies, effectively allowing unauthorised game copies to be read without requiring a modchip.</p><p>This only required patching the game image by adding dummy metadata and partitions only used by DVD movies. Then, when the burned copy is inserted into the console, the drive won’t reject it, but it won’t execute the game either. However, with the help of a Homebrew program called <strong>ESR</strong>, the game could be kickstarted.</p><hr/><h2 id="thats-all-folks">That’s all folks</h2><p>Congratulations and thank you for reaching the end of the article! To be honest, there was so much to talk about that I wondered if readers would eventually get tired of PlayStation-related stuff after finishing this.</p><p>Anyway, in all seriousness, I do hope you discovered new things after reading this article and if you have any comments, don’t hesitate to <a href="https://www.copetti.org/about/">contact me</a>.</p><p>Until next time!</p></article></div>
