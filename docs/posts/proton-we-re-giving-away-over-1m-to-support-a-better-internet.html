<p>This year’s Lifetime Account Charity Fundraiser was a record-breaking success, generating over $1 million to directly support organizations fighting for privacy, freedom of expression, and human rights worldwide.</p>



<p>We’ve held our annual charity fundraiser since 2018, raffling off exclusive Lifetime Accounts while raising millions for the fight for a better internet. But this year, the community fundraiser exceeded all expectations, bringing our total charity contributions over the last <a href="https://proton.me/about/impact">seven years to over $4 million</a>.</p>



<p>The 2024 fundraiser brought in $927,470 from over 90,000 tickets sold to 43,631 participants. We’re donating a further $150,000, bringing the total donation amount to <strong>$1,077,470</strong>. This achievement is a testament to the power of this community and our ability to collectively build a better future.</p>

<h3>The difference you’ve made</h3>



<p>Every ticket you purchased is more than just an entry into our exclusive raffle — it’s a vote for a freer, more open world. The funds raised this year will support 10 vital organizations selected by the Proton community, along with others we’ve supported in previous years. <a rel="" target="_self" href="https://proton.me/blog/2024-lifetime-account-charity-fundraiser">Learn more about the recipients in this article.</a></p>



<p>Thanks to your continued support, we have now distributed over $4  million in grants globally to aligned organizations. Beyond financial contributions, Proton also provides free access to our services in regions where privacy is under threat, supports open-source projects, and leads efforts to resist online censorship.</p>
