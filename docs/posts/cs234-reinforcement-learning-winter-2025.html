    <h1>CS234: Reinforcement Learning Winter 2025</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
					I care about academic collaboration and misconduct because it is important both that we are able to evaluate
					your own work (independent of your peer’s)
					and because not claiming others’ work as your own is an important part of integrity in your future career. I
					understand that different
					institutions and locations can have different definitions of what forms of collaborative behavior is
					considered
					acceptable. In this class,
					for written homework problems, you are welcome to discuss ideas with others, but you are expected to write up
					your own solutions
					independently (without referring to another’s solutions). For coding, you may only share the input-output behavior
					of your programs. This encourages you to work separately but share ideas
					on how to test your implementation. 
				

Please remember that if you share your solution with another student, even
					if you did not copy from
					another, you are still violating the honor code.

Consistent with this, it is also considered an honor code violation if you make your assignment solutions publicly available, such as posting them online or in a 
public git repo.


					</p><!-- In terms of the final project, you are welcome to combine this project with another class
				assuming that the project is relevant to both classes, given that you take prior permission of the class
				instructors. If your project is an extension of a previous class project, you are expected to make significant additional contributions to the
				project. -->
