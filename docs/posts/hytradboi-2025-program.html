A place for ideas to cross-fertilize between the two disciplines.</p><p>The conference is hosted in a chat room and all the talks are recorded and captioned in advance. Join from a different time-zone, watch talks on your lunch break, answer questions in your pajamas, pause the talk to go feed your baby. Conferences work better async.</p><p>HYTRADBOI takes place <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=HYTRADBOI+2025&amp;iso=20250228T09&amp;ah=6&amp;p1=256">2025 Feb 28 0900-1500 PDT</a>. The chat will stay open for weeks afterwards for those who can&#39;t attend live.</p><hr/><p><em>&#34;HYTRADBOI is so addictive. I&#39;m just clicking on every talk one-by-one and can&#39;t stop. Lots of interesting material and perfect talk length.&#34;</em> -- <a href="https://x.com/nikitonsky/status/1521511745671606272">Nikita Prokopov</a></p><p><em>&#34;HYTRADBOI was the best remote conference I&#39;ve attended and should be used as an example for how we should reconsider the medium of conferences&#34;</em> -- <a href="https://x.com/abanduk/status/1848111970827776247">Alexander Bandukwala</a></p><p><em>&#34;The embodiment of &#34;the future is here but not evenly distributed.&#34; Each talk felt like a sneak peek at 3-5 years into the future. 10/10 wouldn&#39;t miss it for the world.&#34;</em> -- <a href="https://x.com/PredragGruevski/status/1847852144868622756">Predrag Gruevski</a></p><p><em>&#34;I still get more traction from the 10 minute video I posted at HYTRADBOI than any talk/paper I&#39;ve presented at SPLASH. I had more salient questions about Mech than I&#39;ve ever gotten from SPLASH, VC head hunters setting up meetings, and even Graydon Hoare stopped by for a chat.&#34;</em> -- <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42017132">Corey Montella</a></p><p><em>&#34;I&#39;m really impressed by the quality of talks at HYTRADBOI this year. There&#39;s so many smart people looking to the sky, dreaming about the future of programming, and seeing relations in the clouds. Everything can be a database if you squint hard enough.&#34;</em> -- <a href="https://x.com/ekzhang1/status/1520163922485157889">Eric Zhang</a></p><p><em>&#34;Was struck by the density of connections across talks... there are some cool ideas in the air right now and this conf really brought them out.&#34;</em> -- <a href="https://x.com/geoffreylitt/status/1520163029328949248">Geoffrey Litt</a></p><p><em>&#34;Highly recommended to all DB-minded tweeps out there...  it&#39;s amazing for learning about a bunch of new things in a short period of time.&#34;</em> -- <a href="https://x.com/gunnarmorling/status/1520469363186413568">Gunnar Morling</a></p><p><em>&#34;I&#39;m really sold on the 10-minute format after HYTRADBOI.&#34;</em> -- <a href="https://x.com/morsapaes/status/1520502841995104256">Marta Paes</a></p></div></section><section><div><h2 id="program">Program</h2><p>0900-1000: Compilers</p><ul><li><p>Database query compilation: our journey</p></li><li><p>A YJIT interview</p></li><li><p>Can we democratize JIT compilers?</p></li><li><p>Safe and productive performance with user-schedulable languages</p></li></ul><p>1000-1100: Understanding programs</p><ul><li><p>How debuggers work</p></li><li><p>Debugging compiler-optimized code: how it works and doesn&#39;t</p></li><li><p>Side-Eye: ask your programs anything</p></li><li><p>Let’s run a million benchmarks</p></li><li><p>Rocket science of simulation testing!</p></li></ul><p>1100-1200: Wild ideas</p><ul><li><p>Back to modularity</p></li><li><p>DB usability: as if</p></li><li><p>Twizzler and far out memory sharing: precise abstractions</p></li><li><p>Programming without pointers</p></li><li><p>Throwing it all away - how extreme rewriting changed the way I build databases</p></li></ul><p>1200-1230: Programmers are people</p><ul><li><p>A case for feminism in programming language design</p></li><li><p>Malloy, mic drop, peace!</p></li></ul><p>1230-1300: Lightning talk buffet</p><ul></ul><p>1300-1400: Query languages</p><ul><li><p>???</p></li><li><p>???</p></li><li><p>???</p></li><li><p>AquaLang: a dataflow programming language</p></li><li><p>A polymorphic data model for SQL using algebraic types</p></li></ul><p>1400-1430: Databases</p><ul><li><p>Use of time in distributed databases —don’t fall behind the times</p></li><li><p>???</p></li><li><p>Thank goodness we&#39;re not building a database</p></li></ul><p>1430-1500: Wasm</p><ul><li><p>Thinking in wit</p></li><li><p>Bringing the WebAssembly standard up to speed with SpecTec</p></li></ul></div></section><section><div><h2 id="lightning-talk-buffet">Lightning talk buffet</h2><p>You can <a href="https://forms.gle/4PvHxisUr6JNG6KHA">submit a pre-recorded lightning talk</a> for the lunchtime break.

If your product/project vanished tomorrow, would the talk still be worth watching?</li><li>Is submitted by Feb 16.</li><li>Is at most 3:00 minutes long. Not 3:01 minutes.

We wanted to do something a little different. But it&#39;s hard to say no to people who already gave you money.</p><p><strong>What about accessibility?</strong> All the talks are captioned and the event is based around a text chat.</p><p><strong>Will recordings be available afterwards?</strong> All the talks will be prerecorded and will be published here afterwards. The discussion and chat rooms will not be recorded.</p><p><strong>Can we behave like idiots?</strong> We expect everyone to <a href="https://berlincodeofconduct.org/">conduct</a> themselves like the professionals you are. Also: be curious and constructive rather than cynical and dismissive, stay on topic and avoid digressions that are likely to start fights.</p><p><strong>Who is running this thing?</strong> HYTRADBOI is organized by <a href="https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/">Jamie Brandon</a>.</p><p>If you have any other questions get in touch at <a href="mailto:info@hytradboi.com">info@hytradboi.com</a>.</p></div></section></article></div>
