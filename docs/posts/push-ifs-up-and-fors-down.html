<section id="Push-Ifs-Up">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Push-Ifs-Up"><span>Push Ifs Up</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>If there</span>’<span>s an </span><code>if</code><span> condition inside a function, consider if it could be moved to the caller instead:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>frobnicate</span>(walrus: Walrus) {</span>
<span>    ...</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>frobnicate</span>(walrus: <span>Option</span>&lt;Walrus&gt;) {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>walrus</span> = <span>match</span> walrus {</span>
<span>    <span>Some</span>(it) =&gt; it,</span>
<span>    <span>None</span> =&gt; <span>return</span>,</span>
<span>  };</span>
<span>  ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>As in the example above, this often comes up with preconditions: a function might check precondition</span>
<span>inside and </span>“<span>do nothing</span>”<span> if it doesn</span>’<span>t hold, or it could push the task of precondition checking to</span>
<span>its caller, and enforce via types (or an assert) that the precondition holds. With preconditions</span>
<span>especially, </span>“<span>pushing up</span>”<span> can become viral, and result in fewer checks overall, which is one</span>
<span>motivation for this rule of thumb.</span></p>
<p><span>Another motivation is that control flow and </span><code>if</code><span>s are complicated, and are  a source of bugs. By</span>
<span>pushing </span><code>if</code><span>s up, you often end up centralizing control flow in a single function, which has a</span>
<span>complex branching logic, but all the actual work is delegated to straight line subroutines.</span></p>
<p><em><span>If</span></em><span> you have complex control flow, better to fit it on a screen in a single function, rather than</span>
<span>spread throughout the file. What</span>’<span>s more, with all the flow in one place it often is possible to</span>
<span>notice redundancies and dead conditions. Compare:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>f</span>() {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> foo &amp;&amp; bar {</span>
<span>    <span>if</span> foo {</span>
<span></span>
<span>    } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span></span>
<span>    }</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>g</span>() {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> foo &amp;&amp; bar {</span>
<span>    <span>h</span>()</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>h</span>() {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> foo {</span>
<span></span>
<span>  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span></span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>For </span><code>f</code><span>, it</span>’<span>s much easier to notice a dead branch than for a combination of </span><code>g</code><span> and </span><code>h</code><span>!</span></p>
<p><span>A related pattern here is what I call </span>“<span>dissolving enum</span>”<span> refactor. Sometimes, the code ends up</span>
<span>looking like this:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>enum</span> <span>E</span> {</span>
<span>  <span>Foo</span>(<span>i32</span>),</span>
<span>  <span>Bar</span>(<span>String</span>),</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {</span>
<span>  <span>let</span> <span>e</span> = <span>f</span>();</span>
<span>  <span>g</span>(e)</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>f</span>() <span>-&gt;</span> E {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> condition {</span>
<span>    E::<span>Foo</span>(x)</span>
<span>  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span>    E::<span>Bar</span>(y)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span><span>fn</span> <span>g</span>(e: E) {</span>
<span>  <span>match</span> e {</span>
<span>    E::<span>Foo</span>(x) =&gt; <span>foo</span>(x),</span>
<span>    E::<span>Bar</span>(y) =&gt; <span>bar</span>(y)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>There are two branching instructions here and, by pulling them up, it becomes apparent that it is</span>
<span>the exact same condition, triplicated (the third time reified as a data structure):</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>() {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> condition {</span>
<span>    <span>foo</span>(x)</span>
<span>  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span>    <span>bar</span>(y)</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

    </h2>
<p><span>This comes from data oriented school of thought. Few things are few, many things are many. Programs</span>
<span>usually operate with bunches of objects. Or at least the hot path usually involves handling many</span>
<span>entities. It is the volume of entities that makes the path hot in the first place. So it often is</span>
<span>prudent to introduce a concept of a </span>“<span>batch</span>”<span> of objects, and make operations on batches the base</span>
<span>case, with a scalar version being a special case of a batched ones:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span></span>
<span><span>frobnicate_batch</span>(walruses)</span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>for</span> <span>walrus</span> <span>in</span> walruses {</span>
<span>  <span>frobnicate</span>(walrus)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The primary benefit here is performance. Plenty of performance, </span><a href="http://venge.net/graydon/talks/VectorizedInterpretersTalk-2023-05-12.pdf"><span>in extreme</span>
<span>cases</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a whole batch of things to work with, you can amortize startup cost and be flexible</span>
<span>about the order you process things. In fact, you don</span>’<span>t even need to process entities in any</span>
<span>particular order, you can do vectorized/struct-of-array tricks to process one field of all entities</span>
<span>first, before continuing with other fields.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps the most fun example here is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhage%E2%80%93Strassen_algorithm"><span>FFT-based polynomial</span>
<span>multiplication</span></a><span>: turns out,</span>
<span>evaluating a polynomial at a bunch of points simultaneously could be done faster than a bunch of</span>
<span>individual point evaluations!</span></p>
<p><span>The two pieces of advice about </span><code>for</code><span>s and </span><code>if</code><span>s even compose!</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span></span>
<span><span>if</span> condition {</span>
<span>  <span>for</span> <span>walrus</span> <span>in</span> walruses {</span>
<span>    walrus.<span>frobnicate</span>()</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>} <span>else</span> {</span>
<span>  <span>for</span> <span>walrus</span> <span>in</span> walruses {</span>
<span>    walrus.<span>transmogrify</span>()</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>for</span> <span>walrus</span> <span>in</span> walruses {</span>
<span>  <span>if</span> condition {</span>
<span>    walrus.<span>frobnicate</span>()</span>
<span>  } <span>else</span> {</span>
<span>    walrus.<span>transmogrify</span>()</span>
<span>  }</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>The </span><code>GOOD</code><span> version is good, because it avoid repeatedly re-evaluation </span><code>condition</code><span>, removes a branch</span>
<span>from the hot loop, and potentially unlocks vectorization. This pattern works on a micro level and on</span>
<span>a macro level </span>—<span> the good version is the architecture of TigerBeetle, where in the data plane we</span>
<span>operate on batches of objects at the same time, to amortize the cost of decision making in the</span>
<span>control plane.</span></p>
<p><span>While performance is perhaps the primary motivation for the </span><code>for</code><span> advice, sometimes it helps with</span>
<span>expressiveness as well. </span><code>jQuery</code><span> was quite successful back in the day, and it operates on</span>
<span>collections of elements. The language of abstract vector spaces is often a better tool for thought</span>
<span>than bunches of coordinate-wise equations.</span></p>
<p><span>To sum up, push the </span><code>if</code><span>s up and the </span><code>for</code><span>s down!</span></p>
