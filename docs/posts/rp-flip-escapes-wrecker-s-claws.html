    <h1>RP FLIP escapes wrecker&#39;s claws</h1>

<p>In a quiet corner of the Pacific last August, a vessel unlike any other was making what many thought was its final voyage. <a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/">R/P FLIP </a>(Floating Instrument Platform), the U.S. Navy’s<a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/"> legendary research vessel </a>that could stand on end like a floating skyscraper, was being towed to Mexico to be scrapped. For well over half a century, FLIP had been an icon of oceanographic research, a testament to audacious engineering and the human thirst for discovery. Its <a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/">decommissioning</a>, announced last year, marked the end of an era—or so it seemed.</p>



<p>But then, a twist befitting a maritime thriller unfolded. It looks like she has been saved! </p>



<h2 id="h-the-call-that-changed-everything">The Call That Changed Everything</h2>



<p>Giulio Maresca was sitting in his London office at <a href="https://www.deep.com">DEEP</a>, the subsea design firm with ambitions to pioneer underwater human habitats, when the news crossed his desk: FLIP was <a href="https://gcaptain.com/internet-famous-flip-sent-for-scrap/">headed for dismantlement</a>. To Maresca and his colleagues, FLIP was more than metal and machinery; it was a symbol of what could be achieved when imagination met engineering.</p>



<p>“The directive from our founder was quite clear,” Maresca recalls with a smile. “‘Save her. Don’t come back without her.&#39;”</p>



<p>Within 48 hours, a DEEP team was en route to Mexico, racing against time to intercept the vessel before it met an ignoble end. It was a mission as quixotic as it was urgent.</p>

<p>FLIP isn’t your typical ship. At 355 feet long, it was designed to do the unthinkable: flip from a horizontal floating position to a vertical one, submerging 300 feet of its length below the ocean surface. This unique capability allowed it to become an exceptionally stable platform, unaffected by surface waves—a perfect sentinel for studying acoustics, wave dynamics, and marine life.</p>



<p>Commissioned in 1962, FLIP was a <a href="https://gcaptain.com/the-flip-scripps-institute-of-oceanography/">collaborative effort </a>between the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Over decades, it facilitated groundbreaking research that deepened our understanding of the ocean’s mysteries.</p>



<p>Shaped like a giant baseball bat, the 700-ton FLIP is technically not a ship but a barge. It has no propellers, propulsion, or engine room, and requires towing by a tugboat when conducting scientific missions.</p>



<p>“FLIP was from a time when bold engineering met boundless optimism,” <a href="https://www.deep.com/article/the-onrs-flipping-vessel-which-was-believed-to-be-scrapped-has-been-saved/">says</a> Kristen Tertoole, CEO of DEEP. “An ethos we share and seek to embody.”</p>

<h2 id="h-the-journey-across-oceans">The Journey Across Oceans</h2>



<p>After tense negotiations and a flurry of logistical hurdles, DEEP secured ownership of FLIP. The vessel began a new journey—from Mexico, through the Panama Canal, and across the Atlantic to the Mediterranean. It was a voyage that mirrored its original mission: bridging gaps and breaking boundaries.</p>



<p>Now docked in France, FLIP is slated for a 12 to 18-month refit at <a href="https://mb92.com">MB92</a>, a shipyard rin Barcelona renowned for refurbishing superyachts and handling unusual projects.</p>



<p>“Modernizing FLIP to further our understanding of the ocean is what’s in our DNA,” says Rob Papworth, MB92 Group Managing Director. “We’re exceptionally proud to be involved in this historic endeavor.”</p>



<h2 id="h-a-bold-vision-for-the-future">A Bold Vision for the Future</h2>



<p>DEEP’s ambitions for FLIP go beyond restoration. The company envisions the vessel as a cornerstone in their mission to “make humans aquatic,” enabling people to live, work, and thrive underwater.</p>



<p>“FLIP will play a key role in our fleet, providing a one-of-a-kind platform for ocean research,” Tertoole explains. “She’s not just a ship; she’s a bridge to the next frontier.”</p>



<p>The refitted FLIP will support DEEP’s Sentinel habitat deployments, underwater living spaces designed for extended research missions. Interest from the global scientific community has been immediate and enthusiastic.</p>



<p>“I’m thrilled to confirm that many oceanographic and research groups are already in contact to ensure access,” Tertoole says.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-legacy-continued">A Legacy Continued</h2>



<p>News of FLIP’s salvation has reached those who knew her best.</p>



<p>“I’m delighted by DEEP’s decision to revitalize and modernize the R/P FLIP,” says Dr. Tom Drake of the Office of Naval Research. “This modernization will significantly expand her capabilities in ocean science, breathing new life into a vessel that has been vital to our mission.”</p>



<p>For Maresca, the rescue of FLIP is both professional and deeply personal.</p>



<p>“Everyone in maritime research has a FLIP story,” he says. “She’s inspired generations of scientists and engineers. To be part of her next chapter is beyond rewarding.”</p>



<h2 id="h-turning-tides">Turning Tides</h2>



<p>As FLIP prepares for her relaunch in early 2026, she carries with her not just instruments and equipment, but the weight of history and the promise of future discoveries.</p>



<p>“She’s a vessel born from audacity,” Tertoole reflects. “And that’s exactly what we need now—to be bold in our pursuit of understanding our oceans.”</p>
