    <p>We are excited to announce that F-Droid has been awarded $396,044 from the
<a href="https://www.opentech.fund/funds/free-and-open-source-software-sustainability-fund/">Open Technology Fund’s FOSS Sustainability
Fund</a>.
This grant is specifically designed to support free and open-source software
(FOSS) projects in addressing long-term sustainability challenges, and we
are honored to be among the recipients.</p>

<p>As F-Droid’s user base and community of volunteer contributors has grown, so
have the challenges of maintaining and expanding the project. While our
lightweight, resilient architecture has scaled to meet increasing demand, we
now face critical issues that dedicated and consistent funding will help us
address so we can continue to bring FOSS-based, privacy focused apps to
people around the world, even in places with limited internet access. This
OTF funding will help us:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Refactor and integrate code with other maintained projects</strong> to reduce
technical debt and improve efficiency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Establish clear policies and legal strategies</strong> for handling government
take-down and censorship requests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Improve our localization workflows</strong> to make translations easier to
manage and maintain.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Strengthen our donation infrastructure</strong> so we can sustain F-Droid
long-term.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enhance our hosting and infrastructure</strong> to increase flexibility, reduce
costs, and ensure reliability.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This grant represents a major step forward in ensuring F-Droid’s long-term
sustainability. We look forward to sharing progress as we work on these
improvements.</p>

infrastructure and helping projects like ours continue to thrive!</p>
