<p dir="auto">A purely bash web server, no socat, netcat, etc...</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>bash 5.1</li>
<li>loadable accept builtin (<a href="http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/tree/examples/loadables/accept.c" rel="nofollow">http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/tree/examples/loadables/accept.c</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto">The port can be set by the env var: HTTP_PORT
The path to accept (Directory) can be set by using: BASH_LOADABLE_PATH</p>
<p dir="auto">The scripts need a file as first argument which will be source. The file will need a function named runner, which will be run on each request</p>

<p dir="auto">Well there&#39;s a little problem... since accept doesn&#39;t close the connection (Or i&#39;m doing something wrong), the connection will go into TIME_WAIT.
This means that we need to wait the time the connection will be closed, after that we can reopen a connection.
I will have a look at te source code and probably provide some options, like a bind-address and a close when the FD is closed.</p>
