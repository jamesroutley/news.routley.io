    <h1>Show HN: Every problem and solution in Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hey HN, I&#39;m Aline, founder of interviewing.io and one of the authors of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview (the official sequel to CTCI).</p><p>We just compiled every problem (and solution) in the book and made them available for free. There are ~230 problems in total. Some of them are classics like n-queens, but almost all are new and not found in the original CTCI.</p><p>You can read through the problems and solutions, or you work them with our AI Interviewer, which is also free. I&#39;d recommend doing AI Interviewer before you read the solutions, but you can do it in whichever order you like. (When you first get into AI Interviewer, you can configure which topics you want problems on, and at what difficulty level, and you can add topics and change difficulty levels as you go.)</p><p>Here&#39;s the link: <a href="https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/all-problems/technical-topics" rel="nofollow">https://start.interviewing.io/beyond-ctci/all-problems/techn...</a> (You&#39;ll have to create an account if you don&#39;t already have one, but there&#39;s nothing else you need to do to access all the things.)</p></div></div></div>
