<p>More than half of all residents in the Big Tech hub of Silicon Valley are planning to ditch the region due to spiraling costs and quality-of-life issues, according to the results of a poll released this week.</p>



<p>A whopping 64% of residents in Silicon Valley, home to corporate heavyweights such as Google, Meta and Apple, say they are concerned the region is on the wrong track, according to <a href="https://jointventure.org/images/stories/pdf/sv-poll-2022-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the 2022 Silicon Valley poll</a> conducted by Joint Venture and the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, 56% of respondents said they were likely to move out of the Bay Area “in the next few years.” The figure is even higher for working-age residents, with 59% of adults aged 18 to 64 indicating they were likely to seek greener pastures.</p>



<p>Among individuals who plan to leave, 67% cited housing costs, while 47% pointed to a falling quality of life and 43% were sick of the area’s high taxes.</p>



<p>“There’s a mood out there – the mood is gloomy. The mood is darkening,” Russell Hancock, the CEO of Joint Venture and president of the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies, said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during a briefing</a> on the poll’s findings.</p>

<p>“The folks that are working in Silicon Valley think that despite their work, the overall region is losing ground,” Hancock added.</p>



<p>The poll results surfaced during a period in which several prominent businesses, including some based in the Bay Area, have <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/07/tesla-to-move-headquarters-to-texas-elon-musk-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opted to leave California</a> for other states. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/tesla-s-texas-move-is-latest-sign-of-california-losing-tech-grip">Firms that have relocated</a> include Tesla, Oracle, Hewlett Packard and Charles Schwab.</p>

<p>Taking into account all factors, 36% of Silicon Valley dwellers who responded to the poll said the Bay Area’s quality of life has gotten worse over the last five years.</p>
