    <h1>It&#39;s easy to underprice your product (2009)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Enterprise Software is a solution sale typically, and it all boils down to this.  In order for an enterprise to buy something on this scale, it has to make the company money or save them money.  The cost of the product then is set by either how much money it makes or saves the buyer.  The VALUE of the product is the difference between the gain and the cost.  If a company saves $1m because of using your product that cost $1m, then your product has no value.  The bigger the difference the more highly valued it becomes and the more likely you will have customers as marketers working for you.</p>
<p>Your income though is separate from your value.  Your income is set by how many people you provide value to.  For example, iTunes saves me $10 because I don’t have to spend $12 for a CD that contains the two songs I want.  Apple provided me a ton of value, but not a lot of actual income for Apple.  But by offering that same value to millions of people, suddenly they have real income on a highly valued product.</p>
<p>This same concept holds true for enterprise selling.  How many customers can you reach, how much value can you give them.</p>
<p>In order to close the deal though, you first and foremost have to attend to their needs.  Thus your influence is determined by how well you look after the needs of others.  Because of this a commodity seller will price his product as low as possible in order to get a transaction.  A solution seller will meet with his customer, understand their needs and then have an opportunity for a more holistic satisfaction of his customer’s needs.</p>
