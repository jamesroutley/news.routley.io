    <h1>A fourteen-day free trial ain’t gonna cut it</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I&#39;ve been working on Keygen for coming up on 8 years now (May 22nd, to <a href="https://github.com/keygen-sh/keygen-api/commit/84e8ccc35ea4accaf45d8bf529ba554650465644">be exact</a>).
In that time, it&#39;s an understatement to say that I&#39;ve learned a lot. One of the things I&#39;ve
learned is that a lot of founders, myself included, ignore some pretty crucial business
metrics. One of those metrics that we&#39;ll be talking about today is <strong>time-to-convert</strong>.</p>
<p>When I first started Keygen, I did what everybody probably does and set up a 14-day free
trial. What I quickly found is that it&#39;s very hard for a potential customer to integrate
a software licensing API into their entire stack within a 14 days timeframe.</p>
<p>So I started offering free trial extensions. I&#39;d push this on my pricing page, in onboarding
emails, in follow up emails, etc. I wanted to make potentional customers aware that
<em>they had more time.</em></p>
<p>What I found over the next couple years was that the majority of converting customers had
asked for a free trial extension. And out those that <em>did</em> and those that <em>didn&#39;t</em>, my
conversion rate was higher when they <em>did</em> ask for one.</p>
<p>Was there a reason <em>why</em> this was the case? Possibly!</p>
<p>When I extended a trial, I would require the potential customer to put a card on file
before I extended their trial. So we go from free trial without a card, to free trial
with a card. Much better.</p>
<p>You may be thinking — what does this have to do with time-to-convert?</p>
<p>We&#39;ll get there.</p>
<p>Anyways — after discovering that free trial extensions increase conversion rate, I started
personally sending emails to potentional customers that were nearing their trial&#39;s end to
offer a trial extension. This was a pretty big success.</p>
<p>So much of a success, actually, that I stopped being so strict about requiring a card be
put on file — mainly out of laziness — because it was such an annoying back-and-forth
step to do before extending a potential customer&#39;s trial.</p>
<p>Unintuitively to what I learned prior, this didn&#39;t hurt conversion rate (so that potential
reason for a higher conversion rate was moot).</p>
<p>I chugged along manually extending trials for a couple more years.</p>
<p>Then <a href="https://keygen.sh/blog/how-i-replaced-baremetrics-and-chartmogul-with-rake/">I got fed up with limited metrics from Baremetrics and replaced it with a Rake task</a>.
I no longer use that Rake task (it didn&#39;t scale as my Stripe customer count grew), but through
that, I learned about my <strong>time-to-convert</strong>, which is a crucial business metric that remains
unknown to many, many founders (myself included at the time).</p>
<p>What is time-to-convert? It&#39;s the time it takes from a customer signing up to a customer
paying you. Pretty simple.</p>
<p>(For brevity, I&#39;ll refer to this metric as <strong>TTC</strong>.)</p>
<p>So why was this such a big deal?</p>
<p>Well, because my 14-day free trial didn&#39;t line up with the time it takes a customer to realize
value from Keygen — to get to that fork in the road where they can decide &#34;is this worth
my money?&#34;</p>
<p>I gave them 14 days to get to that fork.</p>
<p>But my p50 TTC is <em>41 days.</em> My p90, 130 days; p95, 198; p99, 290.</p>

<p>As I mentioned, I realized that what I was <em>really doing</em> was asking people to sign up
<em>now</em> and complete a proof-of-concept integration <em>in 14 days.</em> This includes reading
documentation, onboarding, and planning and executing a proof-of-concept (PoC).</p>
<p>But my median TTC is 41 days!</p>
<p>That just doesn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>Understanding and integrating a new API can be a lot. On top of other projects, it can
end up being impossible to do in 14 days, from first discovery to being integrated
(or at least with a PoC in-hand).</p>
<p>What I was really asking potential customers to do was <em>wait</em>.</p>
<p>Wait until they&#39;re ready to start understanding the API.</p>
<p>Wait until they&#39;re ready to go through onboarding.</p>
<p>Wait until the PoC is planned.</p>
<p>Wait until dev is freed up.</p>
<p>Wait. Wait. Wait.</p>
<p>What ends up happening is that people get busy and they end up seeing that 14 day
deadline, determine that they&#39;re not ready yet, so they bounce until they <em>are</em>
ready, but then <em>they never come back.</em></p>
<p>I decided that I needed to remove that friction. I wanted to capture these leads
as soon as they decide Keygen may be the solution for them. So ultimately, I can
start nurturing these leads.</p>
<p>So I did what every bootstrapper tells you to never do…</p>
<p>I added an unlimited trial, a.k.a. <em>a free tier.</em></p>
<p>What happened next?</p>
<p>Overall sign ups increased, of course, as it always does with a free tier. But by
segmenting out users that stay on the free tier, I found paid sign ups also increased,
with conversion rate staying steady, but now with no manual work. I say that&#39;s a
win-win.</p>
<p>So, what&#39;s your TTC?</p>
<p>Until next time.</p>
