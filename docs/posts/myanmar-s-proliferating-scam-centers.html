<p>According to numerous reports, large numbers of foreign nationals are trafficked into these compounds and forced to
perpetrate scams.</p><p>Japan has been affected. In February 2025, a Japanese high school student believed to have been held captive in Myanmar was rescued and later arrested on fraud charges.</p><p>According to Myanmar&#39;s military government, from October 2023 to June 2025, authorities deported more than 66,000
foreign nationals who had stayed in the country illegally to participate in fraud or gambling.</p></div></div></section><section id="sec2">

<p>&#34;All but one of the compounds seems to be operating as normal [after the crackdown],&#34; said Eric Heintz, a global analyst at International Justice Mission, a U.S.-based nongovernmental organization that supports people who have escaped scam centers.</p><h3>&#34;Prisons&#34; with three distinct features</h3></div></div><div>
<section>
<div>
<div>

<li>
<p><span>Layouts designed </span></p></li><li>
<p><span>Capacities to hold </span></p></li><li>
<p><span>Locations along rivers</span></p></li></ul></div></div><section>
<div>
<h4>Layouts designed for monitoring workers</h4><p>The first feature is a layout designed to allow for the close surveillance of workers. The expansive grounds are surrounded by fences and walls, lined with numerous structures believed to be watchtowers. Nikkei analyzed and mapped the positions of the structures by using satellite imagery and social media posts.</p><figure>

</div></div><figcaption>Source: Douyin account @美岐不是美岐 (Meiqi Bushi Meiqi) (Nikkei added a white frame)</figcaption></figure><p>A video posted on the Chinese video-sharing platform Douyin shows elevated platforms towering above the surrounding walls. Satellite imagery also captured the main roofed gate on the compound&#39;s south side.</p><p>&#34;It is quite common that the cameras are pointing inside and the wire along the wall bends inside,&#34; said Mark Bo of the nonprofit EOS Collective, which researches online scam operations. &#34;It is not to keep people out of the compound. It is to keep people inside the compound.&#34;</p></div></section><section>
<div>
<h4>Capacities to hold large numbers of people</h4><p>The second defining feature is a massive scale to accommodate a large number of people. Some structures rise more than four stories high, with over 10 buildings standing side by side. Complexes of this magnitude are virtually unheard of elsewhere in the region.</p></div><div>

<p>The sites appear to be outfitted with a range of facilities. Nikkei geolocated video footage depicting the interior of the compound. Visible in the clips were basketball hoops, signs believed to advertise a hot pot restaurant and a noodle shop, and even a building marked &#34;Hospital&#34; in Chinese. &#34;These places [are] set up with all the things that are needed to cater to basically an enclosed community,&#34; said Bo of EOS Collective, &#34;because most people are not really allowed to come and go.&#34;</p><figure>

<div>
<h4>Locations along rivers</h4><p>The third defining feature is a riverside setting. Boat landings adjoin the complexes, facilitating movement to and from Thailand. The Myawaddy area is notorious for illegal cross-border trading with Thailand via the river. Criminal groups are believed to bring people and supplies illegally into the scam centers via boat.</p><figure>
<div role="img" data-atlas-trackable="image" aria-label="A satellite image shows a boat landing near an entrance to Huanya Park. Visible is a boat docked on the Thai side of the river, along with an entrance that provides direct access to the facility for cross-border traffic.">
</div><figure>Source: Planet Labs</figure></figure><p>Myanmar Witness, an investigative organization, determined that the landing, seen in the upper right of the image, is directly linked to the compound. Satellite images show that the landing was developed at the same time as the compound.</p></div></section></section></div></section><section>

<h3>Business network tied to armed groups</h3><p>After the 2021 military coup, Myanmar&#39;s civil war intensified, leaving the central government unable to maintain effective control over the Myawaddy region. In many areas, armed groups of ethnic minorities have established de facto authority.</p><p>One of these groups is the Karen Border Guard Force (BGF). In May, the U.S. sanctioned BGF leader Saw Chit Thu and his family members, accusing them of facilitating scams and human trafficking. The U.K. and the European Union have also imposed sanctions on the leader and other people connected to the BGF.</p><p>When internal documents obtained by the advocacy group Justice for Myanmar (JFM) were cross-referenced against the sanctions list, two sanctioned individuals -- Saw Min Min Oo and Saw Htoo Eh Moo -- were found to be listed as officers of three companies suspected of investing in these scam centers.</p></div><div>
<h4>BGF-affiliated individuals among company officers</h4><figure>
<div role="img" data-atlas-trackable="image" aria-label="Photographs of two individuals linked to the BGF are shown alongside documents containing corporate records. The names of the sanctioned BGF-linked individuals appear in the companies&#39; executive listings.">
</div><figcaption>Provided by Justice for Myanmar</figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>Three scam centers are suspected of being linked to the three companies. These compounds share names with the companies: Yatai New City, Apolo Park, and Yulong Bay Park. According to JFM, many other sites are indirectly connected to the BGF.</p><p>Data suggests operational links among multiple compounds. Over 4.9 million location records from 11,930 mobile devices in Myanmar from Jan. 1, 2024, to May 7, 2025, were obtained and analyzed. Among the devices, five were tracked visiting all three compounds, and were also recorded at KK Park and Huanya Park -- suggesting that individuals involved in scam operations were circulating between sites.</p></div><div>
<h4>Location data points to movements between compounds</h4><figure>

<p>In a response to Nikkei inquiries, a spokesperson insisted that the BGF does not allow fraud-based business operations, does not invest in fraud-related businesses, nor does it have financial stakes in any such business.</p><p>Several other armed groups are also present in the surrounding area, and reports have linked them to the scam centers.</p></div></div></section><section>

<h3>&#39;Modern slavery&#39;</h3><figure>
<p><img src="https://asia.nikkei.com/static/vdata/infographics/myanmar-scam-centers/img/img_sec4-1.jpg" srcset="img/img_sec4-1_small.jpg 622w, img/img_sec4-1_large.jpg 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 286px, 860px" alt="A photo shows victims of human trafficking bearing visible scars from electric shocks and physical abuse." width="1920" height="1280" loading="lazy" decoding="async"/>
</p><figcaption>Human trafficking victims, pictured in Thailand&#39;s Tak province in February, show scars left by electric shocks and beatings. (Reuters)</figcaption></figure><p>Criminal networks amassed such enormous profits that they were able to sustain -- and even expand -- these sprawling compounds. One man who claimed to have perpetrated scams recalled that a deep, resonant beat from a Chinese-style drum would echo through the compound each time a deposit of over $100,000 was received.</p><p>The profits are built not only on the victims of the scams but also on the suffering of the perpetrators. Many described how they were forced to work more than 12 hours a day and were subjected to electric shocks and beatings if they failed to produce results.</p><p>&#34;We don&#39;t like to work like that,&#34; the man said with regret. &#34;I&#39;m a Buddhist, so I believe in karma. I don&#39;t want to steal anyone&#39;s money.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Some people willingly participate in the scams, but many are forced to work against their will,&#34; said Ivan Franceschini, a lecturer at the University of Melbourne who studies online scam labor. &#34;It is modern slavery.&#34;</p></div></div></section><section>

<h3>Crime gangs expand across Southeast Asia</h3></p><div>
<figure>
<ul aria-hidden="true">
<li><i></i>Places believed to be scam centers</li><li><i></i>Flows of workers, other personnel</li></ul><div role="img" data-atlas-trackable="image" aria-label="A map of Southeast Asia shows numerous compounds scattered across Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia. The graphic indicates that criminal organizations are moving out of the Myawaddy area into neighboring countries such as Laos and Cambodia.">

<p>Scam centers are not limited to the Myanmar-Thailand border. According to an April report released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), they are scattered across border regions throughout Southeast Asia. Some Myanmar-based criminal groups have relocated to countries such as Laos and Cambodia in response to intensified crackdowns.</p><p>To address cross-border crime, Japan is strengthening cooperation with local authorities. In May, 29 Japanese nationals were detained by local authorities in Poipet, northwestern Cambodia, on suspicion of involvement in a fraud scheme. The site is suspected to be an overseas base for what Japanese police call an &#34;anonymous and fluid criminal group&#34; -- known as a Tokuryu -- which forms and dissolves through social media networks.</p><p>According to United Nations estimates, losses from scam centers in 2023 reached up to $37 billion in East and Southeast Asia alone.</p><p>&#34;The total revenue of the scam groups exceeds that of drug syndicates and represents one of the most lucrative operations run by global crime organizations,&#34; said Police Lt. Gen. Trairong Phiwphan, commissioner of the Cyber Crime Investigation Bureau. &#34;If we step up our crackdown, the scam groups only change their fraud schemes and places of operations,&#34; he added, pointing to a need for further international cooperation in eradicating the syndicates.</p></div></div></section><section>

<h4>Investigation methods</h4><p>Nikkei analyzed satellite imagery and nighttime light data to identify areas that had seen significant development over the past decade. It then cross-referenced public records and reports, and conducted interviews with experts from NGOs and the United Nations. The investigation was narrowed down to locations that were identified as scam centers by at least two independent sources.</p><p>An additional investigation was conducted into 16 sites suspected of being scam centers. The latest satellite images were used to confirm whether construction had continued following a large-scale crackdown in February.</p><p>The location data and footage of Huanya Park, which was used as a case study, were shared with Myanmar Witness, who assisted in verifying the placement of structures.</p><p>The mobile device location data was provided by the French network analytics company nPerf. The company supplies global telecommunications data categorized by country and carrier.</p><p>Documents indicating links between armed groups and scam centers were provided by JFM. The materials were downloaded from the database of Myanmar&#39;s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration (DICA). Following the coup, access to the database has been restricted, and detailed information is no longer available.</p><p>The worker who escaped from the compound was introduced by IJM on the condition of anonymity.</p></div></div></section></section></article></div>
