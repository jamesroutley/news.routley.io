<ul>
<li>have a week off work next week for my birthday!!! i&#39;m so stoked i love time off ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ… (3 day workweek when?)</li>
<li>this week someone sent me a translated short story called <a href="https://www.guerrillamedia.coop/en/la-esta/">esta</a>, which i liked a lot as i love the idea of hotspot girls and various other connotations. it also made me sad in combination with having been recommended this (very heavy-handed and i don&#39;t agree with all its heavy-handedness) short film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okFodk74gyk">pig</a>. i like how so much of experiencing a piece of media is discursive, how the <a href="https://we-b.site/">fingerprints</a> remain from one experience and transfer onto another.</li>
<li>i&#39;m gonna try and write more in a more literary fashion on this blog going forthâ€”they say, like they haven&#39;t eschewed capital letters for fashion/because i like it for a very long timeâ€”cos i realise i wasn&#39;t because this is nominally a tech blog, but when is the last time a code block darkened this blog&#39;s door? Fairly certain not since I&#39;ve been on bearblog so at least a few years lol. i should move my oldest posts over maybe, some of them have code! meshing niceÂ® writing and code sounds like a cool challenge anyway.</li>
<li>in general i am trying to be a bit less wedded to outcomes and a bit more wedded to process. i would make one of those &#34;i have broken up with &#39;goals&#39;, &#39;process&#39; is my new best friend&#34; memes but you can probably imagine it?</li>
<li>having/witnessing really cool conversations about life and art and disability over on <a href="https://thewhitepube.com">the white pube</a>&#39;s discord, and discords in general. i really value having cool spaces to have conversation and i was asking about it a bit over on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oluoluoxenfree/">my instagram</a> (i mostly do everything in stories/disappearing posts and it&#39;s a hard habit to break sorry), i am unsurprised most people said private or private-ish spaces like group chats are their fave places to chat, even if i did prime the waters a bit by saying what my faves were. where do you go for conversation online these days?</li>
<li>noting daily wins in my daily pages in my note taking app, and wondering if in light of my shift away from goals i should change my weekly review. last big change was leaving <a href="https://capacities.io/">capacities</a> for <a href="https://obsidian.md/">obsidian</a>, mostly due to better templating which meant i didn&#39;t need to manually fill in a bunch of fields every week. i think that combined with using obsidian for <a href="https://notes.olu.online">my notes</a> means its been a good move. i should probably actually finish tiny experiments to see if there&#39;s a good way to review iterative experiments other than &#34;did i tick off this todo&#34;.</li>
<li>focusing on two books has helped a lot - tiny experiments OR blood in the machine, only for this week - except i obviously started reading literary mags, newsletters and articles again. i love a loophole.</li>
<li>i&#39;ve been eating mini eggs and creme eggs (more non-fairtrade/possibly enslavement produced chocolate, sigh), chorizo stews, udon noodles with sautÃ©ed cabbage and poached eggs, and drinking the red orange san pellegrino.</li>
<li>hope you have a lovely week ðŸ’Ÿ</li>
