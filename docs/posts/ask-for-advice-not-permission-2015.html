    <h1>Ask for Advice, Not Permission (2015)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>One of the most common anti-patterns I see that can create conflict in an
otherwise collaborative environment is people asking for permission instead of
advice. This is such an insidious practice that it not only sounds reasonable,
it actually sounds like the right thing to do: “Hey, I was thinking about
doing X, would you be on board with that?”</p>
<p>The problem with permission is that you are implicitly asking someone else
to take some responsibility for your decision. You aren’t inviting them to
participate in its success — permission is hardly seen as a value adding
behavior — but if it goes wrong you might end up involving them in the
failure: “Hey, I asked that team and they said it was fine.”</p>
<p>As a consequence, someone being asked for permission will feel a burden to
do some diligence and may be resentful of it. That may mean second guessing
work that has already been done to ensure they are supportive which is
likely a waste of time. In the best case, they will ultimately agree but
this process will nonetheless feel disrespectful and appear to demonstrate a
lack of trust to the team asking permission. In the worst case, they will
decline to give their permission which is not just a matter of rejection but
also of loss given all the thought that had already been put into the issue
before bringing it to them. Worse still, if your goal is permission you’ll
have a strong instinct to present information in a way that favors the
outcome you want which can come across as dishonest and further undermine
trust. All around, this is a bad situation that breeds antagonism.</p>
<p>Advice, on the other hand, is easy. “Hey, I was thinking about doing X, what
advice would you give me on that?” In this instance you are showing a lot of
respect to the person you are asking but not saddling them with
responsibility because the decision is still on you. Your obvious goal with
this approach is to do the best you can, so they are going to trust you
aren’t hiding any gritty details and therefore aren’t going to waste time
second guessing your premises. They are going to feel comfortable giving you
all their honest feedback knowing the responsibility lies with you, and your
ego will remain intact because you invited the criticism on yourself
directly.</p>
<p>Asking for advice is also a much better way to create advocates for your
approach as those who have contributed their ideas will feel some personal
ownership over the result much more than if they were just another approval
in a long chain. It gives them a personal stake in the resulting success or
failure.</p>
<p>The world is full of gatekeepers who think they have veto rights. Don’t
believe them. If you need them to invest time or resources then they deserve
to have a say, otherwise the responsibility remains with you to decide how
to proceed and to suffer the consequences or reap the rewards, as the case
may be.</p>
<p>Pitbull got it right: “Ask for money, get advice. Ask for advice, get money
twice.”</p></section></div></div>
