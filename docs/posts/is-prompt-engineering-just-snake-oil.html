    <h1>Ask HN: Is prompt engineering just snake oil?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Is prompt engineering a snake oil? The engineering, as the word stands so far in history is about observing clear limitations and capabilities of something and then &#34;engineering&#34; things around it such as &#34;engineering a compiler&#34; is all about knowing the underlying processor, memory and other characteristics and then engineering a solution that converts a text notation to a stream of instructions that try to strike a balanced tradeoff.</p><p>But with LLMs, no one knows their workings once they are trained. The other day, Bark model[0] for text to speech, the team itself has following to say on details:</p><p>&gt; Below is a list of some known non-speech sounds, but we are finding more every day. Please let us know if you find patterns that work particularly well on Discord! [laughter], [laughs], [sighs]....</p><p>So that&#39;s the team themselves not knowing what their model is capable of then how come prompt engineering is any engineering at all?</p><p>[0] <a href="https://github.com/suno-ai/bark">https://github.com/suno-ai/bark</a></p></div></div></div>
