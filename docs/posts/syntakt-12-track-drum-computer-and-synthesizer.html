    <h1>Syntakt – 12 Track Drum Computer and Synthesizer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div>

<p>Syntakt comes full of filter and envelope goodness. All tracks have a Multimode filter to put to use allowing you to emphasize different parts of your sound, with the digital tracks also able to call on Parametric EQ and a Base-width filter – an additional filter giving you even more sonic control.</p>
<p>Choose from two amplitude envelope types to define the ideal contour of your sound. Try out the ADSR envelope – for your wicked synth lines – or the simpler AHD envelope – perfect for transient percussive sounds.</p>
<p>All synth tracks have two full-featured LFOs with multiple waveforms and modulation destinations. Set your sounds in motion, subtly or harshly, rocking the amplitude envelope, volume, filter, synth engine settings, even the other LFO; pretty much any parameter you like. Then redefine space and time with a slice of reverb and delay.</p>
