    <h1>Pocket gets worse the more you use it (2019)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Having used Pocket&#39;s article-archival-and-management tool -- sort of a bookmarks-on-steroids product -- for the past year or two, and with news that the company has just been acquired by Mozilla (it&#39;s been getting increasingly integrated into Firefox over the past year or so), I&#39;ve realised one of my most fundamental complaints about it.</p>

<p><strong>The more I use Pocket, the worse it gets.</strong></p>

<p>As I&#39;ve mentioned (a few too many times), I do a lot of research, much of it with articles and documents, and tools for managing the pile / heap / mountain / swamp are a constant and growing consideration.  Pocket addresses one part of the problem:  online HTML-based content.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve compiled a large set of articles.  I&#39;m a top-1% reader, according to an emailed report sent a month or so back.  Some 2,000 or so in Readability, prior to its demise, manually transferred in the week before that service was to go dark, and another 1,000 - 3,000 likely in Pocket itself.  I make copious use of tagging features.  My intent is to have <em>a vetted, known, classified, and useful set of references to comb through for specific research needs as I organise and write</em>.</p>

<p>The fact that I can&#39;t even say, not even <em>approximately</em>, how much material I&#39;ve archived, is a profound signifier of the design failures and lack of consideration of use-cases.  The folks at Pocket seem to have given absolutely no thought to how people might use their product, or benefit by self-directed use.  (And it&#39;s not as if they&#39;ve not heard:  I&#39;ve shared this complaint with them multiple times over the past two years.)  Which is to say:  even at the most basic level, <em>the product isn&#39;t getting better or more useful</em>.</p>

<p>The problem is, the bigger the pile gets, the less manageable it becomes.</p>

<h2>Tags</h2>

<p>Great, I have an unlimited set of tags.</p>

<p>It takes me 45 seconds just to scroll from the top of the list to the end on the Android app.</p>

<p>The tags are not searchable.  A &#34;type and autocomplete&#34; feature -- you know, the sort of thing software has offered since the 1980s, would be peachy.  No such luck.</p>

<p>The tags don&#39;t auto-complete <em>and activate such that, say, I can hit &lt;enter&gt; to select one</em> when filing new material.</p>

<p>If I make a tyop, I cannot, say, <em>select a tag and edit it right there</em>.  No, I&#39;ve got to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Switch to the &#34;Tags&#34; view.</li>
<li>Select the &#34;Edit&#34; option.  <em>Before</em> I search for the tag I want to edit.</li>
<li>Scroll through the list to where the tag in question is.  Given a 45s full-list scan, this takes an average of about 22 seconds.</li>
<li>Edit and save the tag.</li>
</ol>

<p>What <em>could</em> be a two-second, in-place operation, becomes an epic-journey-to-a-distant-land-and-quest-for-a-holy-grail, fraught with pitfalls and traps -- if you make the wrong turn, you waste time, have to backtrack, and start over again.  During all of which your flow-of-thought is being completely interrupted.</p>

<p>Desktop clients (Web) don&#39;t appear to be any better.</p>

<p>If I happen to typo a tab and want to delete it, in the Android app, with my Bluetooth keyboard attached ... I cannot.  I&#39;ve got to switch to the <em>software</em> keyboard, re-select the tag in question (because, of course, it doesn&#39;t stay selected), then delete it.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not possible to filter by <em>multiple</em> tags.  Something which is hugely annoying as that is a fast and efficient way to cut through a large mass of material -- items which are cross-referenced and multi-tagged could be, say, filtered with the remaining tags within the set listed.  Check the ones you&#39;re interested in and you should end up with a small set of items of interest.</p>

<p>And finally:  the tags display is highly minimal and hidden under windows.  These should be presented <em>on the document itself</em> (head or foot, preferably), <em>with all tags visible at all times</em>.  Selecting a given tag should call up all content under it (and provide for further filtering by other tags).</p>

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>For a time, it seemed that Pocket had a full-text article search, able to use multiple words.  That ... seems to have vanished.</p>

<p><strong>Keep in mind:  Pocket archives its articles locally.  <em>The search can run over the local archive, and doesn&#39;t impose any server load.</em>  But it doesn&#39;t.</strong></p>

<p>No bueno.</p>

<p>Which means that <em>despite having an archive of data sitting on my own device, in text form, eminently searchable</em>, my best option is to try an online search (of a much larger corpus), and hoping I might land the items of interest.</p>

<p>This is, to say the least, slightly frustrating.</p>

<p>The fact that Pocket&#39;s search, such as it is, seems to be limited to <em>a single keyword</em>, to not support <code>&#34;quoted strings&#34;</code>, or <code>-excluded terms</code>, or field-specific criteria (author, date, publisher, website), ranges, etc., is ... similarly a staggering oversight.</p>

<p>Frankly, I&#39;d get more utility (and am strongly considering how I might accomplish this) downloading or fetching content locally, and running various search/index tools over it.</p>

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>No, that&#39;s not a typo:  I&#39;m referring to <em>in-document</em> search.  On the Android app, there is no text search <em>within</em> documents.</p>

<p>If I want to find a particular passage, I&#39;ve either got to vgrep for it (scan manually), switch to one of the Web interfaces, or pull up the original article online.  Another staggering oversight.  (Though in fairness:  fairly common amongst Android apps, which only means the firing squad&#39;s work is all the larger.)</p>

<h2>Workflow</h2>

<p>There&#39;s no concept of workflow.</p>

<p>Generally, I&#39;m stashing stuff for later review, on which I&#39;ll be associating it with various projects, dumping into a general file, or indicating it&#39;s been seen and found wanting.  A set of workflow-oriented features would help in this.  No such thing exists.</p>

<h2>Going from Browser to Pocket</h2>

<p>One of my most frequent operations is to open a Web page, discover that it is utterly fucked over in its page design, and want to open it in Pocket.  What I&#39;d <em>like</em> to do is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the current tab immediately in Pocket, whilst closing the present window.</li>
</ol>

<p>What I&#39;ve got to do instead is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save to Pocket.</li>
<li>Try to close the current tab -- tricky at best on a mobile device given imprecise location control and click-vs-drag ambiguity, plus focus-stealing by Pocket meaning a keyboard &lt;ctrl&gt;-W generally doesn&#39;t work.</li>
<li>Punch the Pocket icon that appears to switch to Pocket.</li>
<li>Land on the Pocket <em>article list</em> rather than <em>the article I&#39;ve just added to it</em>, requiring a 2nd step to get to that.</li>
</ol>

<p>A one-step process has become a 4-5 step process.  Every. Single. Time.</p>

<p>In the way of Pains Suffered Through Life, it&#39;s not among the largest.  But it&#39;s a telling failure of attention to detail, or consideration of What the User Might Want.</p>

<h2>Reputation</h2>

<p>Since I&#39;m referencing my corpus, over time I&#39;ll build up a set of &#34;hot&#34; articles that are referenced more frequently than others.  I might want to have these turn up quickly in searches ... or perhaps exclude them to find other potentially relevant material.  Again, lack of any user-oriented statistics means this isn&#39;t supported.</p>

<p>Similarly, I&#39;d like to be able to indicate reputation of sources, for accuracy or insight.  I don&#39;t make a habit of choosing a <em>large</em> amount of bogus material, but since one of my research areas is the concept of bogosity itself, there are a few.  And there are also sources and authorities who are particularly compelling.  Being able to track reputation by author, publication, and URL, would again be highly useful.</p>

<h2>Export lists</h2>

<p>A chief value of being able to categorise content is <em>to be able to call it up, and share it</em>, when desired.</p>

<p>I can ... very barely sort-of ... search through and find some subset of my articles.</p>

<p>What I <em>cannot</em> do, and what I&#39;ve wanted to do many times, is to apply one of the non-existent advanced search features above, to select out a set of, say, 2-12 articles or references I think will be particularly useful to someone, and dump that as a set of URLs (to either Pocket or the original sources).  A hugely useful capability, and one which could well help to popularise Pocket itself.  But not present.</p>

<h2>Highlights and notes</h2>

<p>Again:  for research, I&#39;m reading material for synthesis, not just pleasure.  Which means I want to make comments, mark relevant passages, etc.  There&#39;s no capability to do so.</p>

<h2>Paying for it wouldn&#39;t help</h2>

<p>I had, for a while, the trial-mode advanced usage features of Pocket.  That <em>may</em> have included full-text search (it&#39;s not clear that this was or wasn&#39;t included, and ... it&#39;s painfully difficult to find out just what the full-product features are).  There was a &#34;suggested tags&#34; feature, which was nice, though not essential, and I find I somewhat prefer <em>thinking</em> about tags <em>without</em> having them suggested to me (though the ability to check against suggestions would be useful).</p>

<p>But none of the other features I&#39;ve listed are currently in the paid app.  There&#39;s been no visible work I&#39;m aware toward any of them over the past year or so.</p>

<p>I&#39;m familiar with arguments for paying for software.  I&#39;ve never found them particularly convincing, as an individual user, particularly given my experience with Free Software over the years.  Whilst I&#39;ve seen a fair number of FS projects with crappy user relations, in general I&#39;ve found that:</p>

<ol>
<li>The software already anticipates my needs.</li>
<li>Developers are responsive to intelligent requests.</li>
<li>I can contribute myself, to my abilities -- a small number of bugfixes, rather more bug reports, occasional documentation.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the proprietary world, <em>if you are a significant customer</em>, it&#39;s possible to see requests built out.  Ordinary users, particularly in the Web world where userbases are measured in the 100s of millions or billions, rather less so.  In fact, generally, I&#39;ve seen long-standing requests <em>from myself and numerous others</em> utterly ignored, for years.  Most especially if they are for &#34;advanced user&#34; features -- anything remotely generative.</p>

<p>A few hours ago I posted an item at Ello about the DMOZ hierarchy categories -- a list of 800,000+ classifications of online content.  I&#39;d done some quick classification of it, on my Android tablet, using Termux, an add-on Linux environment with actually-capable shell tools, including auto-generating a Markdown table.  It&#39;s a small example of the power of such tools -- the ability to scan through nearly a million items and reduce them to a meaningful report in 18 rows, ready for publication.  (Mind:  Ello&#39;s table support appears broken, though I&#39;ve also posted a copy to a Reddit sandbox.)</p>

<p><strong>That is the level of power and flexibility I expect from, no, demand from, my tools.  And am finding increasingly lacking.</strong></p>

<p>It took me most of a year to even discover Termux, and another several months to learn of the API features enabling clipboard interaction with the Android environment.  Which I&#39;m using, incidentally, to compose this Reddit post, given the pains and pitfalls of using the Web interfaces on Android.</p>

<p>I suspect too that the individual-subscriber market isn&#39;t worth all that much to Pocket either.  Dealing with individual payments and the hassles thereof (from <em>both</em> sides:  credit card and identity fraud affect customers as well), make the margins afforded by support minimal.  Bundling and large-account sales are, with very few exceptions, where the money in software has been made.  Researching a set of Murphy&#39;s and related laws earlier, I came across Mark Miller&#39;s exception to Crane&#39;s Law:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are no &#34;free lunches&#34;, but sometimes it costs more to collect money than to give away food.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s among the motivating influences behind Free Software as well, though it helps to realise that costs can impose themselves in numerous ways.  An avoided cost of free software <em>can</em> be (though not always) the contributions and assistance of others in improving your product.  Going closed and proprietary loses that, though with possibly other beneficial trade-offs.</p>

<h2>What to do?</h2>

<p>Back to Pocket:  my view for now is much as I was treating Readability for the 2-3 years in which that project was obviously a dead man walking.  It was unsuitable to my needs, but marginally better than nothing at all, or other options.  The transition costs (to another proprietary tool, to a nonproprietary tool, my own solution) are all high.  I&#39;m not sure how much metadata I can extract from Pocket, and loss of my tags would be a major hassle.  The evaluation cost of alternatives (Pinboard.in is highest on the list) is itself high.  I&#39;ve been looking at an Emacs-based option, or ... something.  Using mutt or an email-storage format as an article reference tool has crossed my mind more than once.  With an IMAPS server, that gives me remote access, search, filter, annotation, and, with some add-on tagging or other classification systems, more organising capabilities.</p>

<p>Or some sort of DIY web-based interface, with some virtual filesystem approaches to addressing a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190512092903/https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13751560">larger set of concepts</a> including metadata-as-search based on, say, title, author, other persons, dates, organisations, hashes, or content.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also very much like to have other document formats -- PDFs, ePubs, DJVU, Mobi -- included.  For which, the capability to search meaningfully <em>within those docs, as text</em> would be handy (I&#39;m getting well past the point of badly wanting a <code>pdfgrep</code> or <code>ocrgrep</code> type tool -- which reminds me that converting a substantial set of scanned books to eBook format(s) is another pending project).</p>

<p>Mostly though, I wonder why such things are, 25 years into the WWW, approaching 50 years from the birth of Unix, seventy years after Vannevar Bush&#39;s Memex proposal, so fucking hard to get right.  </p>

<p>Is it the problem itself, the people working on it, the dynamics of trying to commercialise such systems, or what?</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<h3>17 March, 2017</h3>

<p>I&#39;d submitted a request to Pocket support when I first posted this, about two weeks ago now.  Having heard no response, other than an automated acknowledgement, I&#39;ve just submitted it again yesterday.  Again, an automated response but nothing more.</p>

<p>This is disappointing.</p>

<p>Pocket <em>have</em> tended to be responsive, and friendly, to requests, which was a ray of hope.  Mind:  actually <em>addressing</em> the substance of those requests through fixes and enhancements, not so much.  I&#39;m aware that there can be long lists of such requests, that there&#39;s a lot of behind-the-scenes work, and more.  But over the course of 1-2 years, with some pretty significant issues, I&#39;d hope to see <em>some</em> progress.  There&#39;s been ... none.</p>

<p>Elements of the product as it stands are good.  But at least for my use-case, it&#39;s the oversights which are increasingly glaring and inexcuseable.  I don&#39;t like rolling my own for all the obvious reasons, but it really seems as if what I&#39;m looking for doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

<h3>7 May, 2017</h3>

<p>I did finally hear back from Pocket a few days ago, they&#39;ve seen the comments here and acknowledged them.  For that alone, I&#39;m grateful.</p>

<p>Foulups happen and messages get dropped, I&#39;ve seen that.  I&#39;ve <em>also</em> seen projects go completely dark (Readability had done that for a few years before shutting down), so ... it&#39;s a concerning sign.</p>

<p>I <em>would</em> like to see movement.  If not, I&#39;m considering other options.  Semantic filesystems or something along those lines is starting to sound more interesting.</p>
