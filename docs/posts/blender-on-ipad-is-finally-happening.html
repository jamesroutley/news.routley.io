Proving it&#39;s not a pipe dream, a hands-on tech demo will debut at SIGGRAPH 2025 in Vancouver, offering a first glimpse at how Blender runs on a standalone tablet.</p><p aria-hidden="true">Importantly, this isn’t Blender Lite. This is Blender, with all the power, functionality, and depth users expect, reimagined for iPad Pro and touch-tablets. And it could be a game-changer for mobile creativity.

But only now, with devices like the iPad Pro matching desktop-class performance, has the idea of creating professional 3D art and assets on the go felt within reach. If you&#39;re looking to get started in this space, check out our guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-ipad-for-drawing" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.creativebloq.com/buying-guides/best-ipad-for-drawing">best iPad for drawing</a> and explore what’s currently the top of the line.</p><p>Blender’s developers agree. “To support Blender’s mission of making 3D technology accessible to everyone, it’s important to fully embrace these platforms,” reads the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://code.blender.org/2025/07/beyond-mouse-keyboard/" target="_blank" data-url="https://code.blender.org/2025/07/beyond-mouse-keyboard/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">Blender blog post</a>. And crucially, this isn’t about dumbing things down. The new interface isn’t a watered-down companion; it’s Blender rethought to match the needs of artists who live in a multi-touch world.</p><p>This means creators who prefer a tablet as their main device and want to unlock from a desktop can now do so in a more profound way. And it means artists who need to tweak a model on the train or paint textures from a café. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.creativebloq.com/tag/zbrush" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.creativebloq.com/tag/zbrush">ZBrush</a> for iPad revealed, this can be done, but when touch, gesture, and stylus work together, it can also open up a new kind of workflow, one that&#39;s more intuitive.

There’s no split, no simplified &#39;tablet mode&#39;. Instead, the Blender team is building platform-specific templates and input options on top of regular Blender.</p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qaX8VhnPi4XE6QnMSqgFxk"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.</p></section></div></div></div><p>That means if you’re sculpting on an iPad, then switch to a desktop with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.creativebloq.com/tag/wacom" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.creativebloq.com/tag/wacom">Wacom</a> Cintiq, your experience will stay consistent. The aim is to offer Blender as you know it, just more accessible in more places.</p><p>The tablet interface is being designed around a single full-screen window, with floating regions for context-specific tools. It’s a nod to the limited screen size of tablets, but one that avoids the cluttered feel of overlapping windows. Sidebar tabs use icons instead of text, and menus are collapsed by default. There’s even a curated helper overlay to keep essential shortcuts within easy reach.</p><p>Mockups released so far show a surprisingly elegant sculpting workspace, a rethought Tool Panel that floats into view, and context-sensitive wheel menus look like they’ll make navigating Blender’s famously deep toolset much more touch-friendly.</p><div id="1948396261175951497"><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Help make blending on-the-go a reality. https://t.co/LeA7GH1vHd #b3d #DevFund pic.twitter.com/ntMum4HM9r<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1948396261175951497" data-url="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1948396261175951497" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">July 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote></div><h2 id="features-coming-to-future-platforms-3">Features coming to future platforms</h2><p id="e4cd7042-7797-48cf-bf4c-3a4395e6b339">One of the most exciting aspects of Blender on iPad is how much of the tablet UI/UX work will flow back into the desktop version of Blender. Features such as the Quick Favorites editor, iconised sidebar tabs, and togglable UI elements are already appearing in the Blender 5.0 alpha.</p><p>This is part of Blender’s inclusive design ethos. Improvements designed for touch, like wheel menus, interactive status bars, and multi-touch gestures, are being implemented in ways that benefit both tablet and desktop users. It’s a truly device-agnostic mindset that puts the artist first.</p><p>Whether you’re a new user or a seasoned pro, the prospect of Blender on iPad is a great time to explore our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.creativebloq.com/3d-tips/blender-tutorials-1232739" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.creativebloq.com/3d-tips/blender-tutorials-1232739">Blender tutorials</a> to brush up on your skills or dive in for the first time.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="016247a1-9c36-4f31-b65d-ad5816600a7a"><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-320-80.png.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-480-80.png.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-650-80.png.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-970-80.png.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-1024-80.png.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-1200-80.png.webp 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)"/><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo.png" alt="Blender for iPad" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-320-80.png 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-480-80.png 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-650-80.png 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-970-80.png 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-1024-80.png 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo-1200-80.png 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" loading="lazy" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo.png" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HpEE9ZV3wm2LcWSxjGpdQo.png"/></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Blender)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="ios-android-and-beyond-3">iOS, Android and beyond</h2><p id="c5ef335a-d00a-4f13-a1a6-199637272b81">While the initial focus is on iPad Pro with Apple Pencil, Android tablets and other pen-enabled devices such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.creativebloq.com/tech/phones-tablets/microsoft-surface-pro-12-review-genre-blender" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.creativebloq.com/tech/phones-tablets/microsoft-surface-pro-12-review-genre-blender">Microsoft Surface Pro</a> and Wacom MovinkPad 11 are on the roadmap.
