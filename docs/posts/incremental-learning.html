Instead we regard it as something that just happens to us. But learning must itself consist of sets of skills we grow ourselves; we start with only some of them and slowly grow the rest. Why don&#39;t more people keep on learning more and better learning skills? Because it&#39;s not rewarded right away, its payoff has a long delay.</p></blockquote><p>This article describes the fastest avenue towards rock-solid lifetime knowledge: <strong>Incremental Learning</strong>.</p><p>Incremental learning is the fastest and the most comprehensive way of learning available to students at the moment of writing (2013).</p><p>Incremental learning is a consolidation of computer-based techniques that accelerate and optimize the process of learning from all conceivable material available in electronic form, and not only.</p><p>Currently, SuperMemo is the only software that implements incremental learning. In SuperMemo, the student feeds the program with all forms of learning material and/or data (texts, pictures, videos, sounds, etc.). Those learning materials are then gradually converted into durable knowledge that can last a lifetime.</p><p><strong>Incremental learning helps the student convert all forms of learning material into durable and lasting memories.</strong></p><p>In incremental learning, the student usually remembers 95% of his or her top priority material. That knowledge is relatively stable and lasts in student&#39;s memory as long as the process continues, and well beyond.</p><p><strong>Incremental learning easily ensures 95% recall of top-priority learning material for lifetime</strong> (as long as the student ensures a regular review along the prescription provided by the program).</p><p>The cost of high <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">knowledge retention</a> is very small when compared with various traditional learning methods. For example, in learning a language, the vocabulary of an educated native speaker can be retained in SuperMemo at the cost of 20 minutes per day in the first years of the process, and mere minutes in later years (assuming the original set is acquired in portions spread over 4 years in 30-50 min. sessions).</p><p><strong>Incremental learning ensures high recall at a fraction of the cost in time (as compared to textbook learning).</strong></p><p>The incremental learning derives its name from the incremental nature of the learning process. In incremental learning, all facets of knowledge receive a regular treatment, and there is a regular inflow of new knowledge that builds upon the past knowledge. In incremental learning, the student sits in the driving seat and determines which knowledge should be mastered. He or she determines when this happens, with what degree of detail, at what <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>, and at what desired degree of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">recall/retention</a>. For example, in a single session, the student may learn a few facts of geography, discover a few rules of healthy lifestyle, figure out a few statistical formulas, read a couple of paragraphs from a friend&#39;s blog, process a few minutes of his home video collection, annotate a few family pictures, watch a few pieces from his YouTube video collection, and read a few articles in subjects related to a forthcoming exam. In other words, all areas of knowledge keep growing in parallel in proportion to interests and importance.</p><p>Typical learning at school puts an emphasis on a few areas of knowledge and neglects all the remaining areas. A medical student may spend a few months mastering anatomy, while gradually forgetting his biochemistry material in the meantime (or the other way round). At the same time, he or she will not find time to study important issues of the day that will always depend on a given person in a given context. With blinkers imposed by the heavy load of school material, the student may never find time, for example, to figure out what incremental learning is. Narrow horizons and narrow perspectives only make it harder to further rationalize the selection of the learning material.</p><p><strong>Incremental learning is the opposite of the irrational school system learning in which a heavy focus is put on just a few areas of knowledge in a semester (at the cost of other, equally important, areas of learning).</strong></p><h2> <span id="General_outline_of_incremental_learning"> General outline of incremental learning </span></h2><p>In incremental learning, you acquire and maintain knowledge using the following steps:</p><ul><li> importing knowledge from various electronic and non-electronic sources (e.g. articles on the web, YouTube videos, music files, pictures from your camera, e-mails, scanned paper notes, etc.)</li><li> <a href="#Priority_queue">prioritizing knowledge</a> for incremental processing (e.g. high <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> for physics, low <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> for movie trivia, etc.). Incremental approach means processing knowledge in small bits and in small steps</li><li> gradually converting the learning materials into lasting knowledge in your memory. This conversion may also produce an easily searchable and well-annotated computer media archive that does not even need to be part of the learning process</li><li> expanding creatively upon the acquired knowledge (e.g. in the process of <a href="#Incremental_writing">incremental writing</a>, <a href="#Incremental_problem_solving">problem solving</a>, etc.)</li></ul><p><strong>With incremental learning, you can consolidate all sources of knowledge, and convert information into lifetime memories at the chosen cost in time, and along strictly defined goals and priorities.</strong></p><h2> <span id="Components_of_incremental_learning"> Components of incremental learning </span></h2><p>Incremental learning tools differ substantially for various forms of learning material, media, and goals. Here are the main components of incremental learning:</p><ul><li> <a href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a></li><li> <a href="#Visual_learning">incremental image learning</a> (or visual learning)</li><li> <a href="#Incremental_video">incremental video</a></li><li> <a href="#Incremental_audio">incremental audio</a></li><li> <a href="#Incremental_mail_processing">incremental mail processing</a></li><li> incremental creative elaboration (incl. <a href="#Incremental_problem_solving">incremental problem solving</a>, <a href="#Incremental_writing">incremental writing</a>, etc.)</li></ul><p>With the rich toolset offered by incremental learning, all reading, learning, viewing, archiving, and annotation functions can be delegated to SuperMemo. This goes far beyond standard learning and includes personal notes, home videos, lectures available in audio and video formats, YouTube material, family photo-albums, diaries, audio files, scanned paper materials, etc.</p><p>The oldest, most popular, and the most mature component of incremental learning is <strong>incremental reading</strong>. We will use incremental reading as the comprehensive introduction to other forms of incremental learning.</p><h2> <span id="The_value_of_interruption_in_learning"> The value of interruption in learning </span></h2><p>In incremental learning, we often quickly move from one subject to another. Such interruptions may occur many times during a single learning day. When people first learn about this incremental methodology they immediately ask <em>&#34;Why interrupt? Aren&#39;t these the prime principles of human endeavour to be thorough, persist, and do things right to the end?&#34;</em></p><p>The 3 main advantages of interruption in learning are:</p><ul><li> <strong>improving memory</strong>: spaced learning has long been proven dramatically more efficient than conglomerate learning massed in time</li><li> <strong>improving learning choices/priorities</strong>: unless the learning material has been pre-selected by a higher authority, student&#39;s own choices require prioritization, which in turn requires preview. Previewing is a form of interruption. Regular interruption allows of prioritizing on the go</li><li> <strong>improving attention</strong>: whenever attention declines, change of the subject is the simplest remedy other than taking a definite break from learning</li></ul><p>As for the disadvantages ... there are none! Simply put: <strong>interruption is optional!</strong> It is true that incremental learning may lead to &#34;learning impatience&#34; and &#34;craving interruption&#34;, however, these have never been proven detrimental beyond showing that once you employ incremental learning, you may never want to go back to traditional &#34;book at a time&#34; learning. Nevertheless, you should not forget that schools are incremental too. Just on a slightly moderate scale. Schools employ interruption when kids move from geography to physics, or when they close the books for the day.</p><p>Once the art of incremental learning is mastered, the advantages go far beyond the advantages of the interruption or <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>. Here is a shortlist (for a detailed discussion see: <a href="#Advantages_of_incremental_reading">Advantages of incremental learning</a>).</p><ul><li> <strong>massive learning</strong> - you learn  more than you thought your memory can hold </li><li> <strong>95% knowledge retention</strong> - you nearly eliminate the problem of forgetting</li><li> <strong>lifetime memories</strong> - your memories will last for life (as long as you stick with the regular review schedule based on <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>) </li><li> <strong>comprehensive learning</strong> on all fronts (rather than the school-like focus on 2-4 majors)</li><li> <strong>better understanding</strong> of the studied subject is assisted by moderation in consuming details, and easy inclusion of explanatory material (e.g. from dictionaries and/or encyclopedias)</li><li> <strong>better consolidation of the knowledge structure</strong> by incremental approach, interrupted learning, spacing, and slotting in of the new knowledge. Contrary to popular belief, incremental learning helps you keep the big picture in your mind</li><li> <strong>better attention</strong> by focusing on a single issue at a time without ever missing a detail, and by remedying attention deficits with a constant change of the learning material</li><li> <strong>creativity</strong> - by encountering different subjects in unpredictable sequences, your creativity soars. You can employ it, for example, in the process of <a href="#Incremental_problem_solving">incremental problem solving</a> or <a href="#Incremental_writing">incremental writing</a> (this article was written using incremental writing tools in SuperMemo)</li><li> <strong>battling chaos</strong> - it is easier to resolve contradictions in SuperMemo, e.g. when processing new research with contradictory claims and findings. Unlike your memory in &#34;real life&#34; where you keep oscillating between contradictions, SuperMemo does not tolerate information discrepancy. Contradictory material converges up to a point when you realize you need to decide on the nature of the truth</li><li> <strong>all knowledge is well prioritized</strong></li><li> <strong>all knowledge is easily searchable</strong></li><li> <strong>all knowledge is quantifiable</strong> (size, retention, workload, etc.)</li><li> <strong>stresslessness</strong> - nothing frees your mind for learning efficiently as the sense that no detail will ever be missed and you can focus on a single problem at a time while delegating other problems to later</li><li> <strong>fun</strong> - once you master incremental learning, it can truly be the best part of your day with few other earthly pleasures giving you as much satisfaction as new useful knowledge</li></ul><p>In short, with incremental learning you learn fast, you acquire massive loads of knowledge, retain memories for life, remember almost all that you have learned, understand things better, develop harmoniously in all directions, enhance your creativity, and all that while having incredible fun! If that sounds too good to be true, please read more below or just give it a solid try.

A well-written article will get you to the basic idea from its first paragraph or even a sentence. Incremental reading is best suited for articles written in hypertext or in an encyclopedic manner. Ideally, each sentence you read has a contribution to your knowledge and is not useless without the sentences that follow. </p><p>Imagine that you would like to learn a few things about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamal_Abdel_Nasser" rel="nofollow">Gamal Abdel Nasser</a>. You will, for example, import to SuperMemo an article about Nasser from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>. In the first sentence you will find out that &#34;<em>Gamal Abdel Nasser (1918 - 1970) was the second President of Egypt</em>&#34;. If you are new to Nasser, you may be happy to just know he was the Egyptian president and safely jump to reading other articles. Thus you may delay the encounter with the historic role of Nasser and economize some time to finding out, for example, who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Peres" rel="nofollow">Shimon Peres</a> is. When you see the Nasser article for the second time, you might find that &#34;<em>He was followed by after President Muhammad Naguib and can be considered one of the most important Arab leaders in history</em>&#34;. This piece of knowledge is also self-contained and you can patiently wait for your third encounter with Nasser. When you return the next time, you may conclude that another piece about Nasser is of lower priority: &#34;<em>Nasser was born in Alexandria</em>&#34;. You can schedule the review of that piece in 2-3 years. Perhaps your interest in Nasser or in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria" rel="nofollow">Alexandria</a> will grow to the point that this knowledge will become relevant. If not, you can always <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Dismiss">dismiss</a> or delete such an <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extract</a>. Alternatively, you can skip a few paragraphs and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extract</a> a more important sentence: &#34;<em>In 1952, Nasser led the military coup against King Farouk I of Egypt</em>&#34;. Even if your read individual sentences about Nasser in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> lasting months, your knowledge will progressively expand and will become increasingly consolidated (esp. if you employ <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>, which are mandatory for longer <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a>).</p><p>Naturally, not all texts are are so well-suited for incremental reading. For example, a research paper may throw at you a detailed description of methods and leave results and conclusions for the end. In such cases, you may <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extract</a> the abstract and delay the body of the paper by a period in which you believe the abstract will have been sufficiently processed. Then, if you are still interested in the article, you can schedule the methods well into the future (you will or will not read the methods depending on the conclusions of the article). You can schedule the results and the discussion into a less remote point in time, and proceed with reading the conclusions.</p><p>The hardest texts may not be suitable to reading in increments. For example, a piece of software code may need to be analyzed in its entirety before it reveals any useful meaning. In such cases, when the text (here the code) comes up in the incremental reading process, analyze it and verbalize your conclusions. The conclusions can then be processed incrementally. You will generate individual questions depending on which pieces of knowledge you consider important and which become volatile. The original computer code can be still retained in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> as reference only.</p><p>When learning at the university, you do many courses in parallel. That&#39;s a macro version of incremental reading. Many people love to zap TV channels and play a chaotic version of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/video.htm">incremental video</a> with their TV set. Zapping may not be a recommended way of learning, but it won&#39;t leave your mind blank. Another example can be seen in people who have a habit of reading a few novels in parallel. Their limit on the number of novels comes from the limits of human memory. There is a breaking point beyond which a novel, if read in bursts separated by longer <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a>, cannot be followed due to fading memories. Incremental reading is based on <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/smintro.htm">SuperMemo</a>, and by definition is far less limited by your forgetful memory. The number of articles in the process can reach a hundred thousands, and given basic skills, you won&#39;t get confused.</p><h2> <span id="Complexity_of_incremental_learning"> Complexity of incremental learning </span></h2><p>Unlike classic SuperMemo, incremental learning requires quite a lot of experience and training before it becomes effective. However, your investment will be returned manifold once you become proficient with the method.</p><p>Incremental learning is a consolidation of technologies that have been in development for nearly 3 decades. It is still in the process of maturing and it is still pretty complex. It requires skills that take months to develop. It requires your own strategies that may mature over years. Moreover, incremental learning requires the mastery of SuperMemo, which has been optimized for professional use. As such it is not beginner friendly.</p><p>Users complain that SuperMemo has a steep learning curve. They are right. SuperMemo has been optimized to make a life of a pro easy. It makes life of beginners hard because it does not ever compromise the learning efficiency for sleekness or marketing value. Take the <a href="#Priority_queue">priority queue</a> as an example. Nearly everyone asks why the articles of highest value have a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> of 0% rather than the obvious 100%. They ask: <em>&#34;Why is SuperMemo always keeping things upside down?&#34;</em>. They got a point. However, no pro user would ever swap the ease of typing 1, 2, 3 for his top priority material as opposed to 99, 98 or 97. Those dilemmas slow down the adoption of SuperMemo. However, once you become a pro, you will appreciate this approach and will more likely become a lifelong devotee.</p><h2> <span id="Introduction_to_incremental_reading"> Introduction to incremental reading </span></h2><p>Traditional linear reading is highly inefficient. This comes from the fact that various pieces of the text are of various importance. Some should be skipped. Others should be read in the first order of priority. Old-fashioned books are quickly being replaced with hypertext. Hypertext will help you quickly jump to information that is the most important at any given moment. Hypertext requires a different style of writing. All linear texts can assume that the reader is familiar with the preceding sections. This makes them context-poor. Within hypertext, individual texts become context-independent, and all difficult terms and concepts are explained primarily with additional hyperlinks. In the same way in which the web helped delinearize the global sources of information, SuperMemo can help you delinearize your reading of whatever linear material you decide to import to SuperMemo. While reading with SuperMemo, you will see a linear text as a sequence of sections subdivided into paragraphs and individual sentences. SuperMemo will help you provide a separate and independent processing for each section, paragraph or sentence.</p><h2> <span id="What_is_incremental_reading.3F"> What is incremental reading? </span></h2><p>Incremental reading is a learning technique that makes it possible to <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/il.htm#Can_you_really_read_thousands_of_articles_at_the_same_time.3F">read thousands of articles at the same time</a> without getting lost. Incremental reading begins with importing articles from electronic sources, e.g. the Internet. The student then extracts the most important fragments of individual articles for further review. Extracted fragments are then converted into questions and answers. These in turn become subject to systematic review and repetition that maximizes the long-term recall. The review process is handled by the proven <em><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/english/ol/background.htm">spaced repetition algorithm</a></em> known as the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/smintro.htm"><strong>SuperMemo method</strong></a>.</p><div><p><strong>Incremental reading converts electronic articles into durable knowledge in your memory.</strong> This conversion requires minimum keyboard&amp;mouse work:</p><ul><li> <strong>Input</strong>: electronic articles (e.g. collected from the net)</li><li> <strong>Output</strong>: well-remembered knowledge (quizzed regularly in the form of questions and answers)</li></ul></div><p>In incremental reading, you read articles in small portions. After you read a portion of one article, you go on to a portion of another article, etc. You introduce all important portions of texts into the learning process in SuperMemo. This way you do not worry that you forget the main thread of the article, even if you return to reading months later. Your progress with individual articles may be slow, but you greatly increase your efficiency by paying less attention to less important articles and spending more time on articles that are more beneficial to your knowledge. Difficult articles may wait until you read easier explanatory articles, etc. Last but not least, incremental reading increases your efficiency because it is fun! You never get bored. If you do not like an article, you read just a sentence and jump to other articles. This way your attention and focus stay maximized.</p><p><strong>Warning!</strong> Incremental reading may seem complex at first. However, once you master it, you will begin a learning process that will surpass your expectations. You will be surprised with the volume of data your memory can process and retain!</p><h2> <span id="Five_basic_skills_of_incremental_reading"> Five basic skills of incremental reading </span></h2><p>Incremental reading requires skills that you will perfect only over months and years of use.

To avoid importing advertising and other garbage, in Internet Explorer, select portions of the text that is to be imported. If you select texts before imports, you are less likely to need filters to get rid of troublesome HTML (available by pressing <em>F6</em> on the imported article). If you prefer to use other browsers, e.g. Chrome or Firefox, you will need to use <a href="#Import_by_Copy.26Paste">Copy&amp;Paste method</a>, or re-open the selected articles in Internet Explorer.

Use the following criteria to decide when to stop reading the article:<ul><li> <strong>lack of time</strong>: if you still have many articles for review for a given day and your time is running out, keep your increments shorter. After some time, being in a hurry will be a norm and you will tend to read only 1-2 paragraphs of each article and dig deeper only into groundbreaking articles that will powerfully affect your knowledge.</li><li> <strong>boredom</strong>: if the article tends to make you bored, stop reading. Your attention span is always limited. If your focus is poor, you will benefit more from the article if you return to it after some break. Go on to reading something that you are not yet tired of. If SuperMemo schedules the next review at a date you consider too late, use <em>Ctrl+J</em> or <em>Shift+Ctrl+R</em> to adjust the next review date.</li><li> <strong>lack of understanding</strong>: if you feel you need more knowledge before you are able to understand the article, postpone it (e.g. use <em>Ctrl+J</em> or <em>Shift+Ctrl+R</em> and schedule the next review in 100 days or so). If you believe you have already imported articles with relevant explanatory knowledge, you can search for these articles (e.g. with <em>Ctrl+F</em>).

For example, if you have extracted the following fragment from your reading about the history of the Internet:</p><blockquote><em>The Internet was started in 1969 under a contract let by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which connected four major computers at universities in the southwestern US (UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UCSB, and the University of Utah)</em></blockquote><p>you may discover that when review <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> become long enough, you may not actually be able to recall the name of the ARPA agency or even forget the year in which the Internet started. You can then select an important keyword, e.g. <em>1969</em>, and use <strong>Remember cloze</strong> to produce the following question-answer pair:</p><blockquote><em><strong>Question</strong>: The Internet was started in <span>[...]</span> under a contract let by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) which connected four major computers at universities in the southwestern US (UCLA, Stanford Research Institute, UCSB, and the University of Utah)<br/></em><strong>Answer</strong>: 1969</blockquote><p>In the course of learning, you will need to polish the above <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> by manual editing it to a more compact and understandable form:</p><blockquote><em><strong>Question</strong>: The Internet was started in <span>[...](year)</span> under a contract let by the ARPA agency<br/></em><strong>Answer</strong>: 1969</blockquote><p>Or better yet:</p><blockquote><em><strong>Question</strong>: The Internet was started in <span>[...](year)</span><br/></em><strong>Answer</strong>: 1969<em></em></blockquote><p>As for the precious information &#34;lost&#34; during the editing, it can (but does not have to) be learned independently with separate questions generated by <strong>Remember cloze</strong>.</p><p>The mini-editing of questions presented above added the following benefits to the newly created question-answer pair:</p><ol><li> <strong>clearer purpose of the question</strong>: the fact that the question is about the year in which the Internet began is emphasized by using the red-colored <span><em>(year)</em></span> hint.</li><li> <strong>brevity</strong>: by removing superfluous information, you will not waste time on information that is not likely to be remembered (only actively recalled material will be remembered for years). You will answer the question and never focus on which universities were originally connected by the early Internet. If you believe this information is also important, you will use the original <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extract</a> to produce more <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze items</a> that will focus solely on the universities in question by naming them in the answer field (if you disagree, read: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">20 rules of formulating knowledge</a>).</li><li> <strong>understandability</strong>: <em>&#34;the ARPA agency&#34;</em> phrase may defy grammar rules you have learned in primary school, but it is by far more understandable than just <em>the ARPA</em>. In SuperMemo, understandability is more important than stiff rules of grammar or spelling!</li></ol><h3> <span id="Skill_4:_Repetition_and_review"> Skill 4: Repetition and review </span></h3><p><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/help.htm">SuperMemo is based on repetition</a>. You will review the learned material from time to time to make sure you prevent forgetting.</p><p>If you have never tried SuperMemo before, you will need to get the hang of standard repetitions as described <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/help.htm">here</a>.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, your review will be based on similar principles as in classical SuperMemo. The main differencesare:</p><ul><li> the learning process will intermingle reading of new articles with reviewing your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a></li><li> your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> will mostly have a form of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>, i.e. sentences with a question posed by a missing part <span>[...]</span> (e.g. The planet nearest the Sun is <span>[...]</span>)</li><li> as the entire learning process is incremental, your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> will often show up in an unfinished form</li></ul><p>Incrementally processed articles will be subject to periodic review/reading. When you resume reading an article after a certain period, you will proceed to new sections, extracting newly acquired wisdom intoseparate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> with <em>Alt+X</em> (i.e. <strong>Remember extract</strong>). Usually, you will delete the remnants of the processed article with <strong>Delete before cursor</strong> (<em>Alt+\</em>).</p><p>The algorithms that determine the timing of (1) repetitions of question-and-answer material and (2) reviewing reading material are analogous but not identical. Most importantly, all repetitions and article presentations happen in increasing <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> by default. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you will see a constant inflow of new articles into your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a>. Unprocessed material will need to compete with the newly imported material. Increasing review <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> make sure that your old material fades into lower priority if not processed early. The speed of processing will depend on the availability of your time and the value of the material itself. Articles that are boring, badly written, less important for your work or growth, will receive smaller portions of your attention and may go into long review <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> before you even manage to pass a fraction of the text. That is an inevitable side effect of a voluminous flow of new information into your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> and into your memory. However, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priorities</a> can easily be adjusted. If your priorities change, you can modify the way you process important articles. At review time, you can either read the entire article without interruption, or bring it back for review in a shorter <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">interval</a>. You can manually change its <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> (e.g. with <em>Alt+P</em>). You can also use search tools (e.g. <em>Ctrl+F</em>) to locate more articles on the subject that you feel you have neglected. You can reprioritize a bunch of articles by changing their <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>. You can shorten <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> of articles, or review them all when needed (see: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/review.htm">Subset review</a>).</p><p>The algorithm for reviewing questions and answers (e.g. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>) is quite complex and limits your influence on the timing of repetitions (see: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/smalg.htm">SuperMemo Algorithm</a>). This is to ensure that you achieve a high level of knowledge <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a>, which might be compromised by manual intervention. However, the algorithm for determining inter-review <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a> is much simpler and is entirely under your control. Each article receives a specific <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>. The priority determines which articles are reviewed first and which can be postponed in case you run out of time. Each article is also assigned a number called the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#A-Factor">A-Factor</a> that determines how much <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> increase between subsequent reviews. For example, if <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#A-Factor">A-Factor</a> is 2, review <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> will double with each review. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">Priority</a> and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#A-Factor">A-Factors</a> are set automatically, but you can change them manually at any time. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">Priorities</a> and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#A-Factor">A-Factors</a> are determined and modified heuristically on the basis of the length of the text, the way it is processed, the way it is postponed or advanced, and by many other factors. You can change the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#A-Factor">A-Factor</a> of an article by pressing <em>Alt+P</em>. You can also use <em>Shift+Ctrl+Up arrow</em> and <em>Shift+Ctrl+Down arrow</em> to increase or decrease an <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>.

Use <em>Ctrl+J</em> (<strong>Reschedule</strong>) or <em>Shift+Ctrl+R</em> (<strong>Execute repetition</strong>) to determine the date of the next review. <em>Ctrl+J</em> will increment the current <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">interval</a>, while <em>Shift+Ctrl+R</em> will first execute a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Repetition">repetition</a> and then set the new interval. For example, if your current <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">interval</a> is 100 and you specify the value of 3 in <strong>Reschedule</strong>, your new repetition date will be set in 3 days, and the last repetition date will not change (the new interval will be 103). If you do the same with <strong>Execute repetition</strong>, your new <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">interval</a> will be 3 and the last repetition date will be set to today. In other words, <strong>Reschedule</strong> increments the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">interval</a> (it can also shorten intervals), while <strong>Execute repetition</strong> sets the length of the interval (while leaving a trace of a repetition executed in the learning process). Note that <strong>Reschedule</strong> (<em>Ctrl+J</em>) executed at <strong>Next repetition</strong> stage will first complete the repetition and will have the same effect as <strong>Execute repetition</strong> (<em>Shift+Ctrl+R</em>). To delay a repetition during learning, use any of the earlier stages of the repetition cycle.</p><p>In a heavily overloaded incremental reading process, you will often want to focus on a specific subject on a given day (e.g. before an exam).

Topics can also have a form of a picture, a video, a piece of music, etc. Unlike <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>, topics do not test your knowledge. They are used in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Passive_review">passive reading</a>, watching, or listening only. Short text topics are used to generate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>. Topics take part in the incremental learning process. Once they are converted to <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>, they are often <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Dismiss">dismissed</a> (i.e. ignored in learning) or <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/elmenu.htm#Done">done</a> (i.e. deleted from the learning process altogether). Both <strong>Done!</strong> and <strong>Dismiss</strong> must be executed by the user (i.e. they are not automatic).</p><h5> <span id="Using_topics"> Using topics </span></h5><p>Topics are marked in <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/contwind.htm">Contents</a></strong> with a green T icon (<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/8/84/Topic_memorized.gif" width="16" height="16"><img alt="A topic taking part in the learning process" src="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/8/84/Topic_memorized.gif" width="16" height="16"/></a>). Topics may be very long (entire articles) or very short (single sentences). This is how you work with topics:</p><ul><li> read the topic from the top</li><li> if you find some interesting information, extract it (e.g. with <em>Alt+X</em>); the extract will form a new independent topic; the new topic will be shorter and will be handled in the same way as all other topics</li><li> decide how far you want to go into reading the topic depending on its priority and available time (e.g. interrupt fast, if you are in a hurry, or read it all, if the topic is of top importance)</li><li> if you finish reading the topic, execute <strong>Done!</strong> (e.g. <em>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</em>); this will delete the topic without deleting the material that it produced</li><li> only if the topic is as short as a single sentence, create <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> (e.g. with <em>Alt+Z</em>)</li><li> return to reading the topic next time it comes for review</li></ul><p>On longer topics you <strong>read and extract</strong>, on very short topics you <strong>generate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a></strong>.</p><h4> <span id="Items"> Items </span></h4><p>Item in SuperMemo is a piece of knowledge that you want to remember. It usually has a question&amp;answer form. The main difference between an item and a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a> is that an item actively tests your memory (e.g. with a question), while a topic is used for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Passive_review">passive review</a> only (e.g. for reading, viewing, watching, etc.).</p><h4> <span id="Concepts"> Concepts </span></h4><p>SuperMemo 17 introduces a new element type: concept (denoted in <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/contwind.htm">Contents</a></strong> with an orange lightbulb icon (<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/f/f6/Concept_memorized.gif" width="16" height="16"><img alt="SuperMemo: A concept taking part in the learning process" src="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/f/f6/Concept_memorized.gif" width="16" height="16"/></a>)).

It ensures you do not get overloaded, and it ensures that you minimize delays for top priority material.</li></ul><p><strong>Auto-postpone</strong> always leaves a number of top-priority <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> in the queue. The purpose of the postpone is to get rid of the main mass of low-priority material and focus on top-priority material. You are most likely to use <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/postpone.htm">Postpone</a></strong> after a day of learning, while <strong>Auto-postpone</strong> is executed before your learning day begins. This is why it never affects today&#39;s material, and does not postpone top-priority material from previous days. If you have <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/learnmenu.htm#Postpone">Auto-postpone</a></strong> checked on the menu, you will always start the day with all the repetitions scheduled for that day, and a number of unexecuted top-priority repetitions from previous days. Even though <strong>Auto-postpone</strong> increases the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> and reduces the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> of low-priority material, it also makes you benefit from the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a>. Research shows that longer <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> may paradoxically increase the speed of learning (up to a certain point). This comes from the fact that the default <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> in SuperMemo (around 95%) is higher than the retention that delivers the largest number of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> remembered per unit of time invested.</p><p>You can start with default settings of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/priority.htm#Sorting_repetitions">sorting criteria</a>, however, if you feel you make insufficient progress with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> (e.g. high <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Forgetting_index">forgetting index</a>), you can reduce the proportion of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a>. If the inflow of new material is too slow, you can increase the proportion of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a>. If your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priorities</a> are imperfect, increase the degree of randomization. If you think you miss too many high priority <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> (see: <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/tools.htm">Tools</a> : <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/tools.htm#Statistics">Statistics</a> : <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/analysis.htm">Analysis</a> : <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/analysis.htm#Use">Use</a> : Priority protection</strong> from the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/main.htm">main menu</a>), reduce the randomization. By trial and error, you will arrive at your optimum. Even after you find your optimum, keep experimenting with different randomization and topic levels. This will help you avoid various cognitive biases that develop through the routine of learning. It may also be helpful to execute random review from time to time (just to get a general feel of your overall progress).</p><p>With <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Auto-sort">Auto-sort</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Auto-postpone">Auto-postpone</a></strong>, you will nearly never have to worry about <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Overload">material overload</a>. Each time you start SuperMemo for the first time on a given day, it will first postpone repetitions that you failed to execute on previous days. It will use default postpone criteria which you can always modify (e.g. with <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/learnmenu.htm">Learn</a> : <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/learnmenu.htm#Postpone">Postpone</a> : All elements</strong>).

Whatever the value of this parameter, you can still have all your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> postponed.

In most basic areas of knowledge, there are multiple sources of learning materials available. There are fewer and fewer cases where you need to do any scanning. These days, you can even be finicky and search for HTML texts to replace your nice PDF materials (to avoid the pain of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/il.htm#PDF_to_HTML_converters">converting PDF to HTML</a>)</li><li> Some texts rich in pictures and tables may be handled with difficulty by SuperMemo (the older the SuperMemo, the more difficulty you may experience). It may be very useful to learn to use HTML filters (press <em>F6</em>). Some of the problems stem from bugs in Internet Explorer that SuperMemo employs to display and edit texts formatted in HTML. This particularly refers to older versions of Internet Explorer (e.g. IE 6.0). It is therefore highly recommended you install Internet Explorer 7 or later to make your life easier</li><li> If you are pressed by exam deadlines and still not too fluent with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, it would make more sense to do some of your old and new learning in parallel. For example, 30% <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> and 70% traditional learning. You are bound to make many mistakes in strategy and the discovery process may take longer than until the exam. At the beginning you will have a big overhead cost (strategy, material selection, formulation, learning SuperMemo itself, etc.). It would not then be surprising if your performance on the exam actually dropped at your first try! You could pick a couple of chapters that you particularly enjoy and use them in your incremental learning practice. You would then process the rest of the material using your old methods. You cannot possibly embark on a massive conversion of textbooks into SuperMemo material before you get the feel of how to do it right! It can backfire and discourage the use of SuperMemo. As always, proceed carefully and incrementally</li></ul><h3> <span id="Inflow_of_new_articles"> Inflow of new articles </span></h3><ul><li> SuperMemo uses 2 basic element types: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a> (articles) and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> (questions and answers). Those are treated differently in the review process. <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">Topics</a> represent what you want to know, while <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> hold what you know</strong>. To better understand the difference, see: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/eltypes.htm">Topics vs. Items</a></li><li> Keep your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a>/articles in check. Use your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/priority.htm#Sorting_criteria">sorting criteria</a> to make sure you get a solid dose of daily <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>/questions in addition to your reading. High topic overload may slow your item flow and damage the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Active_recall">active recall</a> process. <strong>High topic load will make SuperMemo resemble traditional reading where your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> is unacceptably low</strong>. You can decide your optimum ratio on the basis of time needed for repetitions. For example, 5:1 <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a>:<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a> ratio would probably still make you spend more time on reading than on reviewing. Increase that ratio to increase your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a>, reduce the ratio temporarily if you need to do a great deal of reading. If you are not sure, set <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>:<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a> to anywhere between 3:1 and 8:1.

This will clean up your learning process without affecting the work you have done (all <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> will remain in the learning process). <strong>Done!</strong> deletes (1) the article, (2) its <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/rephist.htm">repetition history</a>, (3) its <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Component">components</a>, etc. However, it leaves the original empty <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> as a source of reference and as a holder for the derived structure of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>. <strong>Done!</strong> is executed at the moment when you believe you have completed reading and processing a given piece of text. This usually means skipping all unimportant parts and extracting all important parts of the article. You repeat <strong>Done!</strong> on all <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">topic extracts</a> generated from the article. You will quickly discover that keeping the original articles for reference only clutters your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a>, increases its size and produces an excess of search hits. Getting rid of the original is usually the preferred action. You can always get to the original article on the net using its reference link</li><li> If you return to an interrupted article in the learning process, the cursor in the text is set on the last-processed text. That text selection is called a <em>read-point</em>. When leaving the article, you can also manually set the <em>read-point&#39;</em> at the place where you interrupted reading. Choose <em>Ctrl+F7</em> to set the read-point, or click the set read-point button (<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/4/4f/Set_read-point.png" width="16" height="16"><img alt="Set read-point marks the selected text as the point from which you will resume reading the next time you return to the presented article" src="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/4/4f/Set_read-point.png" width="16" height="16"/></a>) on the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/readbar.htm"><strong>Read</strong> toolbar</a></li><li> Highlighting texts automatically sets the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Read-point">read-point</a></li><li> Use <strong>Clear read-point</strong> (<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/4/4d/Clear_read-point.png" width="16" height="16"><img alt="Clear read-point removes the read-point from the currently processed text" src="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/4/4d/Clear_read-point.png" width="16" height="16"/></a>) on the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/readbar.htm"><strong>Read</strong> toolbar</a>, or press <em>Ctrl+Shift+F7</em>, to remove the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Read-point">read-point</a></li><li> <em>Enter</em> is the default key used when progressing through the learning cycle. When a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Read-point">read-point</a> is selected and you press <em>Enter</em>, instead of inserting a new line, SuperMemo will automatically begin or resume repetitions. This will also be the case if you make any selections in the text. <em>Enter</em> will play its usual function only if there are no selections in the text. Although using <em>Del</em> and <em>Enter</em> instead of just <em>Enter</em> in these circumstances may seem cumbersome, you will quickly find this behavior indispensable in learning. If you still do not like this <em>Enter</em> behavior despite giving it a try, set <code>Allow Read-Point Enter=0</code> in <em><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/files.htm#Program_files">[BIN]\supermemo.ini</a></em></li><li> If you use <strong>Delete before cursor</strong>, you may be annoyed by lack of <strong>Undo</strong>. However, if you mistakenly delete important texts (e.g. when using <strong>After</strong> instead of <strong>Before</strong>), you can find a temporary backup of the deleted text in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a>&#39;s <em>[TEMP]</em> folder (the file is named <em>Last text portion delete</em> with element number and delete time appended).

Ideally, all passive texts should be deleted when done with. All interference from &#34;outside world&#34; makes SuperMemo less precise. Passive texts provide little extra help in learning. At the same time, they provide interference, and should only be used to generate new <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> (or for reference)</li><li> When you press <em>Alt+Z</em>, the currently selected keyword in the current <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a> is marked as <span>clozed</span>. The newly created <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> <strong>is not visible</strong> (i.e. you will not immediately see the answer nor the deletion brackets). You can see the newly created <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> by pressing <em>Alt+Left arrow</em>. Use that key to edit the newly created <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a> (e.g. to add context clues, shorten the text, improve the wording, etc.). However, if possible, you should do such mini-jobs incrementally, i.e. on the next encounter with the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozed item</a></li><li> If you want to cloze more than one keyword, before you apply <strong>Cloze</strong>, you should make sure that the processed statement or paragraph is as simple as possible. You should try to <strong>use only one-sentence <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a></strong> to generate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>! Some newcomers dislike incremental learning at first. Monster <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> are a chief reason for their negative feelings. Simplifying the parent paragraph to a simple statement will produce simple <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> that will require little processing. Using <strong>Cloze</strong> on complex texts multiplies the cost of re-editing when simplifying texts (in all cases where you cloze more than one keyword). If you use <strong>Cloze</strong> on a longer multi-sentence paragraph, you will have to put extra effort in simplifying the resulting <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>. All <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> should be short enough to ensure you read them entirely at repetition time. Otherwise, your brain will tend to &#34;deduce&#34; the answer from non-semantic cues. This will defeat the purpose of learning! By using one-sentence <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>, you will save ages on repetition time and eons on time needed to simplify <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> and converting them to the final form based on the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/il.htm#Minimum_information_principle">minimum information principle</a>. If you plan to cloze only a single keyword along the incremental principles, you can afford less pre-cloze simplification/editing, esp. on the material that still needs more work on its &#34;big picture&#34; structure</li><li> Your work on extracting fragments, producing <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> and editing them should be incremental. <strong>In each review, do only as much work on the learning material as is necessary!</strong> Extracting and editing in intervals adds additional benefit to learning and is more time-efficient. Each time you rethink structure and formulation, you hone the representation and &#34;connectivity&#34; of a given piece of knowledge in your memory. In addition, your priorities change as you proceed with learning. At times, you will over-invest in a piece of knowledge that quickly becomes irrelevant or out-dated. The incremental approach will reduce the impact of over-investment. Incrementalism should then be used not only while reading, but also in the follow-up processing and formulation of knowledge. See: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/il.htm#Examples:_Incremental_reading_in_action">Examples</a>. Unless you work with top-priority material, do not generate all your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> in one go. Make it incremental. Generate a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a> today, and another one at the next review. The incremental nature of the learning process, variegated coloring of texts marked with processing styles, and a complex extract hierarchy seem to quarrel with the perfectionist nature of many. However, the purpose of incremental reading is the maximum effect in minimum time. For that reason, at extract time, you are already forming passive trace memory engrams of the extracted sentence. The optimum strategy then is not to proceed with generating <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>, but to move on to other <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> in the queue or to other <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> in the same article (if the high priority of the article justifies it)</li><li> Once you finish processing a paragraph with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>, use <strong>Done!</strong> (<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/0/01/Done!.png" width="16" height="16"><img alt="Learning : Done will remove the article from the review process, and delete its contents (without deleting the extracted material" src="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/0/01/Done%21.png" width="16" height="16"/></a>) on the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/learnbar.htm">learnbar</a> or on the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/elmenu.htm">element menu</a> (e.g. with <em>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</em>). This will clean up your learning process without affecting the work you have done. All <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> will remain in the learning process. <strong>Done!</strong> deletes the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extract</a>/paragraph, however, it leaves the original empty <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> as a holder of the derived <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>. Once you believe your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> cover all vital keywords of the statement that forms the topic, you execute <strong>Done!</strong> again. In the end, only <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze items</a> remain in the learning process. Note that the process of descending from the source article to individual <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> may take years.

Lists and sets are a good example of knowledge that does not stick to memory. Even if you perfectly know the map of Africa, answering the request: &#34;<em>List all countries of Africa</em>&#34; may be pretty hard. There are proven techniques that will help you tackle repetitive, list-rich, or boring knowledge with SuperMemo. All solutions are costly at memorization stage, but will pay handsomely in the long run due to lesser forgetting rate. The basic 2 principles are:</p><ol><li> gradually glue individual pieces to your overall knowledge structure</li><li> be as visual and mnemonic as possible</li></ol><p>Here are some specific hints:</p><ul><li> <strong>use a mind map</strong>: search the net for a nice mnemonic picture of the subject studied (e.g. political map of Africa). The picture will provide the basic skeleton for your memory. Like ornaments on a Christmas tree, you will hang new pieces of knowledge on this mnemonic skeleton. Use the picture to illustrate all <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a> and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> in the studied <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Concept_group">concept group</a>.</li><li> <strong>do not learn it all at once</strong>: Add individual <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> gradually at a point when they acquire some special meaning. Add them when they fit snugly with the rest of your knowledge. Add them when you specifically need them or when you learn about a related subject. If you need enumerative knowledge for an exam, cram it using traditional methods, and still continue adding individual pieces in unique contexts later on when you feel they are interesting or important.</li><li> <strong>associate with stories</strong>: if you ask an expert in the field, you will probably hear that (s)he mastered enumerative knowledge by association with individual case stories. Whatever he or she learned at school was quickly forgotten, but individual cases or problems to solve leave a good and durable imprint due to their uniqueness. Once you hit upon a story that is relevant to your hard-to-remember <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>, try to learn those items in the context of that particular story (e.g. hang the Cameroon up on your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Knowledge_tree">knowledge tree</a> only when reading about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Eto&#39;o" rel="nofollow">Eto&#39;s</a> move to Chelsea). If you encounter cases in the course of your practise, describe them shortly and use them to supply context.</li><li> <strong>supplement with incremental reading</strong>: instead of formulating all <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> along the same repetitive and monotonous template, try to use <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> to generate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> that work on separate storylines. Ideally, you would review your topic and generate just a single subtopic (e.g. on a single country in Africa). Always choose the one that seems most obvious or most important to remember. Always try to add some supplementary material. Be sure you do not provide clues that will make you answer correctly without forming an appropriate association</li><li> <strong>compare with experts</strong>: ask an expert in the field how (s)he remembers a given fact or association. In some cases you may be dismayed to see how poorly experts recall compulsory college material. At other times, you will see how their memory tackles the problem with ease by using a simple mnemonic. This will help you emulate real life learning at a compressed timescale without ever wasting time on trying to master what others never manage to master anyway. That&#39;s the basic difference between school learning and your efficient incremental learning: you do not cram it dry along a rigid prescription. You use your creativity to incrementally build a durable structure of useful knowledge!</li></ul><h5> <span id="Example:_dealing_with_enumerations"> Example: dealing with enumerations </span></h5><p>If you happen to learn the geological periods, you are bound to generate nasty <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Leech">leeches</a>, esp. if you are new to the subject. Using the top-down learning rule, be sure you know the eras, before you learn the periods, and before you move on to the epochs, and further down the tree of knowledge.</p><p>A typical mistake would be to start from cramming the meaningless sequence of periods. For example, clozing the Paleozoic Era sequence: &#34;<em>Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian</em>&#34; could result in a question that is bound to cause problems: &#34;<em>Cambrian, Ordovician, <span>[...]</span>, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian</em>&#34;. This <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a> will trouble anyone who is not privy to the field. In other words, only those who come with the knowledge ready in their mind will be able to tackle this type of question at little cost! <strong>Conclusion: there is no point in learning lists the hard way unless you already know what you are trying to learn!</strong> Catch 22!</p><p>Instead of using the above approach, it would make far more sense to first anchor the Silurian period in your mind with some meaningful event. For example, the appearance of the bony fish. This way, we might start with a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a> based on &#34;<em>The bony fish appeared in Silurian (443-419 mn years ago)</em>&#34;. The following question will be far easier to remember: &#34;<em>The bony fish appeared in <span>[...](period)</span>(443-419 mn years ago)</em>&#34;. Even if the answer is the same as in the original unfortunate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a>, that question is not semantically equivalent. You will need more <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>. However, working with similar sequences should always proceed incrementally and in proportion to anchoring individual periods in memory. Later on you can move on to clozing dates, epochs, and other details. All the time you should try to add new interesting anchors and work with the material in parallel to the inflow of meaningful information that is likely to stay long in memory.</p><h3> <span id="Learning"> Learning </span></h3><ul><li> Use <em>Ctrl+W</em> (<strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/tools.htm">Tools</a> : <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/workload.htm">Workload</a></strong> from the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/main.htm">main menu</a>) to <strong>view the calendar of repetitions</strong>.

For some texts, you may find it difficult to reach reasonable attention levels for longer than a few minutes. Often you can retain your maximum processing power for just a single sentence or paragraph. On other texts that are highly interesting, well written, highly useful, or highly important, your curiosity and rage to master may kick in and let you go on for several hours without a break. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, the primary criterion for time allocation is your level of concentration. You can literally lick a hundred articles in a continuous block of time and still keep your mind highly focused and alert. Some articles will be processed in depth, others will be quickly postponed. The concentration criterion is all-inclusive. It includes all factors listed above: difficulty of an article may affect your concentration, your tiredness will always reduce optimum allocations for difficult texts and increase allocations for interesting or enjoyable texts (those who help you &#34;survive&#34; a bad learning day)</li><li> <strong>You can leave some low-priority material in the passive form</strong> (i.e. without generating <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>). Naturally, this material will gradually become difficult to recall or entirely forgotten. The best moment for using <strong>Remember cloze</strong> is when you notice that the material becomes volatile. Do not convert the entire passage into <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> at once (unless it is very important). Pick the most important keyword and create just a single <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a>. When the next review of the passage comes along, you will be able to determine which other keywords must be used with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> to prevent forgetting the key information. It is very difficult to predict how many <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> you will need to generate to attain perfect recall of the whole passage. On occasion, a single <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a> suffices. At other times, a single passage can require a dozen of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a>! </li><li> <strong>The better you get, the more often you will want to resort to incremental learning</strong>. The stronger your incremental learning skills, the shorter the working period that makes employing incremental learning effective. For a proficient user, even a next day&#39;s assignment might make sense to be done with incremental learning tools. For a beginner though, it is enough to consider that it may take you a few months of practise to truly understand the flow of knowledge in incremental reading (and in your memory).

Choose between the two depending on whether you have seen the contents of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> and have attempted to recall it from memory. <strong>Execute repetition</strong> requires providing a grade (unless you execute it on day when a repetition has already been done).</li><li> <strong>For <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> of lesser importance, reduce <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a></strong> (<em>Alt+P</em>), increase the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">interval</a> (<em>Ctrl+Shift+R</em>), or even increase the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Forgetting_index">forgetting index</a>.

If you are learning mathematics, you might wonder if you should commit individual derivation steps of a mathematic proof or solution, or should you just focus on the final outcome. The choice will depend on your goals. If you only need the final formula, time spent on learning the derivation steps could be better spent learning other important portions of the material. If you are not sure today what you will need in the future, you could just type in the whole derivation into a single <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a> and memorize the final formula. Later, in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you will make incremental decisions whether portions of the derivation are or are not important in your work or further learning.

Naturally, derivation will often enhance your ability to efficiently use the formula. Hence the decision is never easy.

If you do not understand a term or concept, you need to dig deep into why. Is it terminology? This can be easily investigated and fixed. Or is it a problem with the material itself? Perhaps you can find an alternative on the net? Perhaps you can find a nice picture on the net to illustrate the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a>? Obviously, each little investigation takes time, but it is better to master 10-20% of the material well, that to cram an encyclopedia without comprehension. Even if you fail an exam, those 10% can be useful in the future (e.g. if you retake the exam). In general, schools load more than students can master and this leads to lots of stress and frustration.

Think applicability!</strong> Luckily, as your knowledge grows, so does your ability to use it efficiently</li></ul><h4> <span id="Re-evaluation_of_items"> Re-evaluation of items </span></h4><p>You should remember that all <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> introduced into your learning process require endless attention in reference to their applicability, formulation, importance, logic, etc. In a well-planned learning process, it should not be necessary to review <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> in the periods between individual repetitions. However, when an <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> comes up for a repetition, you should make a quick and nearly instinctive assessment of the following: </p><ol><li> <em>Do I really need this item?</em></li><li> <em>What is the honest <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> of this item in the entire spectrum of my (desired) knowledge?</em></li><li> <em>Is this item difficult to remember? If so, why?</em></li><li> <em>Is it factually correct?</em></li><li> <em>Is it as simple and clear as it could be?</em></li><li> <em>Do I really need to know it now?</em></li><li> <em>Do you need supplementary knowledge to understand all ramifications of the item?</em></li></ol><p>Here are some typical actions you will take depending on the answer to the above questions:</p><ol><li> <strong>edit</strong> the item. You will use keys such as <em>Q</em>, <em>A</em>, or <em>E</em> to enter a desired text field and edit it. In more complex <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> you will use <em>Ctrl+T</em> to circle between <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Component">components</a>, <em>Alt+click</em> to switch a component between <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Editing_mode">editing</a> and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Dragging_mode">dragging</a> modes, or <em>Ctrl+E</em> to enter the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Editing_mode">editing mode</a></li><li> <strong>de-prioritize</strong> the item. For <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> that are not important enough, or you are not sure are important enough, use <em>Alt+P</em> and reduce their <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>. You can also use <em>Ctrl+Shift+Down arrow</em> for minor deprioritizations</li><li> <strong>reschedule</strong> the item. If you know the item well or for some reason want to manually increase (or decrease) the length of the inter-repetition <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">interval</a>, press <em>Ctrl+Shift+R</em> to select the date of the next repetition</li><li> <strong>dismiss</strong> the item. If you are sure you are not likely to need the item in the future, but you would like to keep it in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> for reference or archival purposes, press <em>Ctrl+D</em>. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Dismissed_element">Dismissed items</a> are removed from the learning process</li><li> <strong>delete</strong> the item. The key <em>Del</em> is very useful in cleaning your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> from garbage that results from your desire to know more than your memory can hold. In the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Editing_mode">editing mode</a> or in spelling <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> (i.e. at times when <em>Del</em> plays text editing functions), you may need to use <em>Ctrl+Shift+Del</em> instead. Please note that deleting an <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> in SuperMemo will delete all its <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Child">children</a>! You may therefore wish to learn to always use safer <strong>Done</strong> (<em>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</em>) instead </li><li> <strong>delay</strong> or <strong>forget</strong> the item. If you think the item is too difficult at the moment, you can postpone learning it. For this purpose, choose <em>Ctrl+J</em> to set a new <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">interval</a> or use <strong>Forget</strong> to transfer the item to the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Pending_queue">pending queue</a>. This will give you some time to import some supplementary material that will help you understand the item</li></ol><h3> <span id="Formulation"> Formulation </span></h3><ul><li> <strong>Use minimum information principle</strong> which says that simple <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> formulated for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Active_recall">active recall</a> bring much better learning results than complex elements. This holds true even though one complex <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> may be equivalent to a large number of simpler elements. See: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/il.htm#Minimum_information_principle">Minimum information principle</a>.</li><li> Some information may be presented as a list. Lists should be avoided. However, some are inevitable (e.g. list of nerves, list of tributaries, list of EU admissions, etc.). If you need to memorize lists, use mnemonic techniques and try to <a href="#Mimic_real_life_situations_to_combat_memory_interference">mimic real life situations to combat memory interference</a>. See also: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/il.htm#Learning_lists">Learning lists</a></li><li> The way you ask the question in SuperMemo may differ from the way your life asks you the same question. In other words, you may store some material in SuperMemo, but a real-life situation will trick you into being unable to recall it. In other words, you need to properly formulate the material to maximize its recall in all potential contexts</li><li> Remember about the universality of memorized rules. For example, it is better to learn a universal mathematical formula than just the examples of its use. Examples can be used to emphasize applicability in various contexts </li><li> You can use <strong>Parse HTML</strong> (<em>Ctrl+Shift+1</em>) to convert selected HTML code into formatting (e.g. try inserting &lt;hr&gt; or &lt;br&gt; and parsing it with <strong>Parse HTML</strong>). You can also use this option to remove formatting (e.g. if you want to get rid of line breaks)</li><li> You can edit your more elaborate texts using your favorite HTML editor. You need to associate that editor with the filename extension <em>*.HTM</em>. For example, if you associate <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36179" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Expression Web</a> (free) with *.HTM, you can edit your texts by just pressing <em>Ctrl+F9</em>. If you would rather leave your associations unchanged, you can use <em>F9</em> to view the file in Internet Explorer, and choose <strong>File : Edit with Microsoft Expression Web</strong> (that menu item is added to Internet Explorer by Expression Web).

Here are some things that you will discover on your own within the first 2-3 months of intense incremental learning:</p><ul><li> recognition is good for your exam, but recall is vital for your professional skills in the long-term</li><li> manually organizing the timing of review is not what suits your memory best; it is actually quite the opposite to the idea of SuperMemo, which says that you review the material at moments that help stabilize memories</li><li> manually organizing the order of review is not what suits your memory best (even though <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/review.htm">subset review</a> is a very useful tool in SuperMemo when preparing for an exam)</li><li> for beginners, traditional learning might be superior to SuperMemo in a very short-term (perhaps up to 1-2 months) because of the steep learning curve. You need to learn the toolset of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> before you can reap the benefits (unless you employ simple Q&amp;A learning when SuperMemo might be superior even within a week&#39;s perspective)</li><li> you may reach 95% recall within 1-2 weeks on condition that you do not <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/postpone.htm">postpone</a> your review. However, if you dump 1,000 pages of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a> into the process at once, you will simply not manage to review all that material as scheduled by SuperMemo, and your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> might hover around 60-80% depending on how much time you invested in making repetitions</li><li> once SuperMemo learns a bit about your memory and habits (1-3 weeks), you will oscillate around 95% recall as of the first repetition (if you do not <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/postpone.htm">delay</a>, and if you stick to the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">rules of formulating knowledge</a>)</li><li> you will quickly discover that multiple <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> on a single paragraph are not a good idea (e.g. compare the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Measured_forgetting_index">measured forgetting index</a> with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> that have the same cloze keywords separated, or just see how thus gained knowledge works in practice)</li><li> you can look at learning parameters in SuperMemo to see how different approaches to learning affect your progress</li></ul><h2> <span id="Advantages_of_incremental_reading"> Advantages of incremental reading </span></h2><p>In incremental learning, you learn fast, you acquire massive loads of knowledge, retain memories for life, remember almost all that you have learned, understand things better, develop harmoniously in all directions, enhance your creativity, and all that while having incredible fun! If that sounds too good to be true, please read more below or just give it a solid try.</p><h3> <span id="Massive_learning"> Massive learning </span></h3><p>Incremental learning offers a possibility of studying a huge number of subjects in parallel. In traditional reading, very often, one book or academic subject must be completed before studying another. With incremental learning, there is virtually no limit on how many subjects you can study at the same time. The volume of processed knowledge can be staggering. Only the availability of time and your memory capacity will keep massive learning in check.</p><h3> <span id="Lifetime_memories"> Lifetime memories </span></h3><p>As incremental learning is based on <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>, all memories that you form while learning will be indefinitely protected from forgetting. See: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/english/princip.htm">General principles of SuperMemo</a>. Only <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/smintro.htm">SuperMemo</a> makes it possible to implement <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. Incremental reading requires continual <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> of knowledge. Depending on the volume of knowledge flow in the program, the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">interval</a> between reading individual portions of the same article may extend from days to months and even years. <strong>SuperMemo (<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/english/ol/background.htm">repetition spacing</a>) provides the foundation of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, which is based on stable memory traces that would not fade between the bursts of reading</strong></p><h3> <span id="High_retention"> High retention </span></h3><p>In incremental learning, the review of the learning material is governed by a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Computational_spaced_repetition">spaced repetition algorithm</a> known as the SuperMemo method. The algorithm ensures 95% knowledge <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> by default. That fraction can be increased at the cost of higher cost in time (i.e. more frequent review). <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">Retention</a> can also be reduced to increase the overall speed of learning. In heavily overloaded <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collections</a>, 95% retention figure refers only to top-priority material. To save time, low priority material may be reviewed less frequently, resulting in lesser <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a>.</p><h3> <span id="Comprehension"> Comprehension </span></h3><p>One of the limiting factors in acquiring new knowledge is the barrier of understanding. Building knowledge in your brain is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle. Some pieces cannot be placed in the puzzle before the others. Some pieces capitalize on others. There is no point in memorizing facts about <em>Higgs boson</em> before you learn what the <em>standard model</em> is and that, in turn, should follow the general understanding of <em>particle physics</em> which itself requires some <em>ABC of physics</em>. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, if you encounter texts related to <em>Higgs boson</em> you can manually delay it until the time you hope your <em>Physics ABC</em> will provide the ground for understanding the boson. In traditional reading, you would just waste your time on reviewing <em>Higgs boson</em> material just because you would not have tools to effectively reschedule and reprioritize your reading in the middle of a longer article. Traditionally, your decision to skip the material would provide no definite way of coming back to the skipped material in the future. With <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you waste no time on reading material you do not understand. You can safely skip portions of material and return to them in the future. You become the master of the conscious knowledge building process. You can gradually build understanding of complex phenomena.</p><p>All written materials, depending on the reader&#39;s knowledge, pose a degree of difficulty in accurately interpreting their meaning. This is particularly visible in highly specialist scientific papers that use a sophisticated symbol-rich language. A symbol-rich language is a language that gains conciseness by the use of highly specialist vocabulary and notational conventions. For an average reader, symbol-rich language may exponentially raise the bar of lexical competence (i.e. knowledge of vocabulary required to gain understanding). <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> makes it possible to delay the processing of those articles, paragraphs or sentences that require prior knowledge of concepts that are not known at the moment of reading. The processing of the learning material will only take place then when the new information begins to slot in comfortably in the fabric of the reader&#39;s knowledge. You can then gradually proceed through this material and gradually build the understanding from basic or simple facts towards details or more complex components of knowledge. You will build understanding, resolve contradictions and ultimately creatively discover new truths about the learned material. Over time, you will optimize the structure of knowledge in your mind in terms of coherence, integrity, and representation. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> will make it possible to tackle the hardest material that might otherwise seem unreadable.</p><h3> <span id="Uniform_progress"> Uniform progress </span></h3><p>Instead of focusing on a single subject of study, the student will review dozens of subject areas in a single day. Instead of monopolizing his or her knowledge with a single area of expertise, he or she will harmoniously deepen all facets of his knowledge in proportion to needs and/or interests. The growth of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Knowledge_tree">knowledge tree</a> will also be guided by the present level of understanding of individual subjects, in proportion to the growth of the supporting knowledge and specialist terminology. Instead of growing a few thick <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Branch">branches</a>, the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Knowledge_tree">knowledge tree</a> will grow twigs in all possible directions while still adding bulk to the trunk and main boughs. Incremental learning is inherently incapable of producing medical experts who have never heard of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt" rel="nofollow">Kuiper Belt</a>, or astronomers who have no idea what constitutes a basic healthy diet. SuperMemo helps you prioritize the acquisition of knowledge in various fields. It also helps you fine-tune the balance between specialization and general knowledge. See also how <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/il.htm#SuperMemo_user.27s_opinion:_Why_I_do_not_use_incremental_reading.3F">SuperMemo prevents tunnel vision</a></p><h3> <span id="Creativity_boost"> Creativity boost </span></h3><p>The key to creativity is an association of remote ideas. By studying multiple subjects in unpredictable order, you will increase your power to associate ideas. This will immensely improve your creativity. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> may be compared to brainstorming with yourself. SuperMemo will throw at you various articles, paragraphs, statements and questions in a most unexpected order. In the long run, the greatest creative advantage comes from knowledge permanently stored in your memory (as opposed to knowledge that requires <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow">Google</a>). It is only a matter of creative effort and invested time before different pieces of knowledge can be associated to form new quality. This will also provide your brain with an entertaining form of mental training that will be highly appreciated in all forms of professions based on intellectual performance.</p><p>With <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/e-mail.htm">incremental mail processing</a>, it is also possible to mesh your learning, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/creativity.htm#Incremental_writing">creative writing</a>, and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/creativity.htm#Incremental_problem_solving">creative problem solving</a> with a creative mail exchange with other people. This may appear helpful in collective problem solving or in complex projects when you need to strike a balance between focused individual work and pulling the team brains together. This process is called <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/creativity.htm#Incremental_brainstorming">incremental brainstorming</a>. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/creativity.htm#Incremental_brainstorming">Incremental brainstorming</a> is slower, but it does not need synchronization (circadian rhythm, time zones, motivation, etc.), and you do not need to interrupt each other&#39;s work. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/creativity.htm#Incremental_brainstorming">Incremental brainstorming</a> will never replace face-to-face interactive collaboration, however, it has many advantages associated with incremental learning (creativity, <a href="#Prioritization">prioritization</a>, <a href="#Attention">attention</a>, <a href="#Meticulousness">meticulousness</a>, long-term viability, etc.). It may provide an excellent knowledge-based supplement, or be your best creative collaboration tool when working at a distance (esp. via different time zones). The creative process is unpredictable, and when you hit your best ideas when the rest of the team is asleep, it makes a good sense to strike the iron while hot: employ creative elaboration and send your idea out.</p><p>For more on the employment of incremental learning in the creative process see:</p><ul><li> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/creativity.htm#Incremental_problem_solving">incremental problem solving</a></li><li> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/creativity.htm#Incremental_writing">incremental writing</a></li><li> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/creativity.htm#Incremental_brainstorming">incremental brainstorming</a></li><li> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/nc.htm">neural creativity</a></li></ul><h3> <span id="Consistency_.28resolving_chaos_and_contradiction.29"> Consistency (resolving chaos and contradiction) </span></h3><p>Contradiction and chaos in your learning material comes from bad sources, from errors, from disagreements in science, or from the fact that you start the process from importing a set of unrelated or even chaotic articles describing a studied complex problem.</p><p>If your learning material contains contradictory information, your brain will quickly alert you to this fact. In classical learning, you would often relearn new facts that would contradict earlier learned facts. Then you would relearn the older version again and this wasteful cycle might repeat more than once. In SuperMemo, the same process can take place; however, there will be two mechanisms that will turn chaos and contradiction into a self-limiting condition. The first mechanism relies on <strong>high <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> of knowledge</strong> in SuperMemo that will often make you instantaneously spot the contradiction: <em>Wait a minute! I have already learned this fact and the answer was different!</em> Unfortunately, even SuperMemo isn&#39;t hermetic to contradiction (your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> actually never reaches 100%). The second mechanism is the <strong>convergence of contradictory material</strong> in time. If you, for example, learn two different answers to <em>What is the size of human population?</em>, say, <em>5.5 billion</em> and <em>6 billion</em>, you will naturally provide a wrong answer to one of these questions. Once you relearn it the new way, you will provide a wrong answer to the other question. Inter-repetition <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> for these two contradictory <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> will get shorter with each relearning cycle. The repetitions of contradictory <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> converge in time. Sooner or later, the red alert will be raised by your brain. You will quickly resolve the difference and delete one of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>. Similar process will affect hazy or incompletely specified information. Your knowledge will grow in consistency with time.</p><p>In scientific research, acquiring engineering knowledge, studying a narrow topic of interest, etc. we are constantly faced with a chaos of disparate and often contradictory statements. By introducing the chaos of new research into SuperMemo, you will gradually locate contradictions and strive at building better and more consistent models in your memory. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=stochastic" rel="nofollow">stochastically</a> <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=juxtapose" rel="nofollow">juxtaposes</a> pieces of information coming from various sources and uses the associative qualities of human memory to emphasize and then resolve contradiction. You will quickly lean towards theories that are better supported by research findings. Those supported poorly will be less firm and will often cause recall problems. Naturally, it may happen that you wish to learn contradictory statements too. For example, the opinions of dissenting scientists. In those cases, SuperMemo will help you emphasize the need of rich context. You will label individual statements with their proponent names or with the school of thought labels.</p><h3> <span id="Stresslessness"> Stresslessness </span></h3><p>Observers and new users of SuperMemo believe that complexity of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> must make it stressful. Some report that <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/il.htm#SuperMemo_user.27s_opinion:_Why_I_do_not_use_incremental_reading.3F">even reading about incremental learning is stressful</a>. However, even though complexity always leads to a degree of stress or confusion, in the long-term, the opposite is true: SuperMemo helps you combat stress. Stressless learning is one of the greatest advantages of incremental learning. All the advantages listed in this section contribute to the sense of fun and relaxation. However, SuperMemo&#39;s ability to combat information overload might be the chief factor. Conversely, low stress levels have a miraculous impact on the effectiveness of learning.</p><p>Not everyone is stressed with information overload. There is a precondition for experiencing stress of having too much to read or too much to learn: obsessive hunger for knowledge, fear of not being able to keep up, pressing need for new knowledge, etc. This precondition is met in a great proportion of the general population according to a number of studies, and is actually less likely in younger individuals, including students, who are shielded from stress by their less crystallized motivation for learning.</p><p>The term <em>Information Fatigue Syndrome</em> has been coined recently to refer to stress coming from problems with managing overwhelming information. Some consequences of IFS listed by Dr. David Lewis, a British psychologist, include: anxiety, tension, procrastination, time-wasting, loss of job satisfaction, self-doubt, psychosomatic stress, breakdown of relationships, reduced analytical capacity, etc. The information era tends to overwhelm us with the amount of information we feel compelled to process. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> does not require all-or-nothing choices on articles to read. All-or-nothing choices are stressful! <em>Can I afford to skip this article? For months I haven&#39;t had time to read this article!</em> etc. SuperMemo helps you prioritize and skip articles partially (by decision) or automatically (i.e. behind the scenes). Oftentimes, reading 3% of an article may provide 50% of its reading value. Reading of articles may be delayed without your participation, i.e. not by stressful procrastination, but by a sheer competition with other pieces of information on the basis of their <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, instead of hesitating or procrastinating, you simply prioritize.</p><p>If you happen to open a dozen of tabs in your web browser, you will often be stressed about the optimum course of action. You might be late for sleep, or late for work, and yet you do not want to lose the information. In SuperMemo, you just <a href="#Skill_1:_Importing_articles">import</a>&amp;prioritize. Or just <a href="#Skill_1:_Importing_articles">import</a>. Nothing is lost. You will encounter the imported material as soon as your learning time allocations permit. Similarly, you can clear your 1,000 pieces mail Inbox in a few hours with all pieces of mail well prioritized and scheduled for review.</p><p>Once you know you can rely on SuperMemo in presenting review material for you, you can eliminate the stress and anxiety related to having too much to study or too much to read. You will never manage to read or learn all that you would hope for, but you will at least not lose sleep over planning and scheduling. SuperMemo is a promise of the best use of your potential. With this conviction, you can devote all your energy to comprehension, analysis and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> of the learned material.</p><p>SuperMemo helps you take away a big deal of information overload stress. In a typical IFS stress therapy, you will see that scrupulous notes, ordering one&#39;s desk, planning one&#39;s work, keeping a calendar of appointments, etc. all have a strong therapeutic value. SuperMemo does exactly the same: it helps you keep a scrupulous and well-prioritized record of what you want to read and takes away stressful chaos from the process of acquiring information and learning the collected material. SuperMemo eliminates disorder and the ensuing uncertainty that often characterizes wild searches for information on the net.</p><h3> <span id="Attention"> Attention </span></h3><p>Human brain has an in-built limit on the attention span. We all get bored with things. This is particularly visible in kids. Limited attention helps maximize the learning input. This is why most toys have a short lifespan, and other kids&#39; toys seem always more interesting. The same is true of reading. Even the best articles can become taxing if they get too long. Millions of people do a daily channel zapping on TV. This absurd activity is driven precisely by the craving for dense action and information variety. A gripping movie goes &#34;too slow&#34; for a typical channel zapper. This is why he or she prefers to watch three movies at the same time (even though the coherence of the plot of each will suffer). Incremental learning is a perfect remedy to the limited attention span. Even a single unlucky paragraph in an article may greatly reduce your enthusiasm for reading. If you stumble against a few frustrating paragraphs, you may gradually develop a dislike of reading a particular article. You may even become fed up with reading for the entire evening.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, once you sense any sign of boredom or distraction, you can jump to the next article with mostly positive side effects (expressed mainly in better memories produced by spaced learning). Unlike in channel zapping, you won&#39;t miss any information. Just the opposite, you will maximize attention per paragraph. Your attention to the same piece of information may depend on your mood, amount of prior reading, today&#39;s interest that may depend on the piece of news you heard on the morning radio, etc. With <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you can fit your best attention to each individual piece of reading. You can change the approach depending on your circadian status (i.e. the time of the day, mental energy, etc.). You can deprioritize articles that undermine attention. You can split intimidating articles into more manageable portions. The boost in attention is one of the main reasons why <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is more fun than ordinary reading.</p><h3> <span id="Consolidation"> Consolidation </span></h3><p>Everything we learn must be reviewed from time to time in order to be remembered. If you read an article in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a>, you already begin the consolidation of memory which may save you lots of time. In traditional reading, you would need to read the whole article, and then to review the article later several times. With earlier releases of SuperMemo, you would need to read the whole article, and then only review the most important parts of the article in SuperMemo at <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> determined by the program. Now you can begin the consolidation-review cycle already during reading! <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> combines the process of extracting pieces of valuable knowledge with memory consolidation. This pre-consolidation will often dramatically reduce the number of repetitions required before your material gets to be reviewed in long <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> of months and years. By the time you convert parts of the material into <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> or question-answer <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>, you will already have it well-consolidated. This consolidation will be based on solid context, a degree of redundancy (that helps <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a>), and an easy-to-remember formulation based on <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a>. Extracting pieces of information from a larger body of knowledge provides your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> with all the relevant context. This slow process of jelling out knowledge produces an enhanced sense of meaning and applicability of individual pieces of information. Semantically equivalent pieces of information may be consolidated in varying contexts adding additional angles to their associative power. In other words, not only will you remember better. You will also be able to view the same information from different perspectives.</p><h3> <span id="Prioritization"> Prioritization </span></h3><p>You always have a long queue of articles to read, and there are always more articles to read than you can ever hope to remember. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you can precisely determine the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> of each article, paragraph, sentence or question. Evaluating articles and prioritizing them is difficult because you cannot do a good evaluation without actually reading a part of the article in question. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you can read the introduction and then decide when to read the rest. If an article is extremely valuable or interesting, you can process it entirely at once. Other articles can slowly scramble through the learning process. Yet others may ultimately be deleted. The prioritization will continue while you are reading the article. If the evaluation of quality or content changes while reading, so will the reading-review schedule.</p><p>Prioritization tools will ensure that important pieces of information will receive better processing. This will maximize the value of your reading time. This will also reduce the impact of material overflow on <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a>. You will always remember the desired proportion of your top-priority material. While the lesser priority material may suffer more from the overflow and be remembered less accurately. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">Priority</a> of articles is not set in stone. You can modify it manually while reading in proportion to the value you extract from a given article. The <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> will also change automatically each time you generate article <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a>. It will change if you delay or advance scheduled reading. The <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> is determined by the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> of articles. The <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> of questions and answers produced from individual sentences is determined by their parenting <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a>. Multiple prioritization tools will help you effectively deal with massive changes in your learning focus. With the prioritization tools you can always determine your learning focus in numbers!</p><p>This is one of the most important things about <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>: efficient fishing for pieces of golden knowledge!</p><h3> <span id="Speed_.28of_reading.29"> Speed (of reading) </span></h3><p>Incremental readers can beat speed readers in the speed of reading! This is true even for relative beginners with little or no speed-reading training. The caveat: all that is possible at the cost of delayed comprehension. In speed-reading, you always need to worry about the comprehension level. High comprehension is where speed-reading skills are vital. However, in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you can quickly skim through less important portions of the text without worrying you will miss a detail. The skimmed fragment will be scheduled for later review. You can optionally determine when the review will happen and at what <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> (low priority review may be delayed further, often automatically). You can quickly jump from paragraph to paragraph, get the overall picture, mark fragments for later reading, mark fragments for detailed study, etc. This speed-reading method, with a bit of training, is stress free. You will eliminate the greatest bottleneck of speed-reading: fear of missing important pieces of information. When you come back to the skimmed fragments in the future, they may have already become irrelevant or less important. That is one of a savings in time generated by <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. You always focus on top priority material and you spend little time worrying about things that are left for later reading. <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> is speed-reading without the loss of comprehension</strong>. Once you speed-read the entire article, you can slowly digest it again from the very beginning in the incremental reading process. Needless to say, speed-reading does not come close to <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> when it comes to long-term <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a>. Memories are always subject to forgetting. All valuable information that you collect while reading may be forgotten at any time. Pieces that would be retained without SuperMemo (e.g. through regular use) produce minimum workload. Other pieces will allow you to never need to come back to the article in question. In conclusion, all knowledge that you need in the long-run, should be best acquired via <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. Traditional reading can still be used for entertainment, temporary knowledge (e.g. how to install a sound board), curiosity (e.g. news), etc. This is not to say that speed-reading skills are not useful in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. If you are already a solid speed-reader, you can add to your speed and comprehension with the help of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. In the process, you will hone your skills further and become even a faster reader.</p><p>See also: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/speedread.htm">Speed-reading on steroids</a>, which also explains the bell-shaped curve of changes in the cost of topic review.</p><h3> <span id="Speed_.28of_formulating_items.29"> Speed (of formulating items) </span></h3><p><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">Cloze deletion</a> is the fastest tool for converting texts into <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>. In addition to massive imports, you can introduce your own rough notes into SuperMemo and later gradually convert them into well-structured knowledge. Less important material may remain unstructured and, as such, less well-remembered. You will see how passive notes gradually fade in your memory and how their individual components will need to be reinforced by formulating specific well-structured <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>. You will make such reinforcement decisions on the one-by-one basis depending on the importance of the fading material and the degree of recall problems. Naturally, due to a typical learning overflow, you will always neglect some portions of the material. This is how you will gain additional speed understood as the time invested per <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a>. You will generate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> faster, re-formulate them with greater ease, and save additional time by neglecting less important material. This is prioritization via formulation. Less important material will remain in a less processed and messier state characterized by lower <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a>.</p><h3> <span id="Meticulousness"> Meticulousness </span></h3><p>With well-prioritized stream of information, you are served knowledge in smaller chunks. This makes it possible to truly focus on most important pieces and discover things that would never get noticed in the mass of voluminous learning. Good attention brings meticulousness and creative discovery. In other words, this is a marriage of <a href="#Prioritization">prioritization</a>, <a href="#Attention">attention</a>, and <a href="#Creativity_boost">creativity</a> advantages with a new twist: noticing things that are hard to notice in massive learning.</p><h3> <span id="Training"> Training </span></h3><p>With massive <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you will hone a set of skills that are vital for efficient learning. By repeating the same procedures over and over again, day in and day out, over the months and years, you will become a master of processing and retaining knowledge! <strong>If you want things well done, do them often</strong>. Here are some examples of skills that will get a boost and change your learning:</p><ul><li> <strong>Recognizing suitable texts</strong> at a glance of an eye. Some texts are great for efficient reading, some are full of chaff and waffle. The more articles you need to preview fast and prioritize, the faster you can do it and more accurate you become. This is an exercise in expert pattern recognition.</li><li> <strong>Formulating knowledge</strong> efficiently. In terms of learning efficiency, the difference between well-formulated and ill-formulated <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> may be as high as 1:10 or even 1:100. Some <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> are mnemonic. Others are confusing. Some require 5-6 repetitions in a lifetime. Others permanently reside among <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Leech">leeches</a> that come back for review and waste your precious time.</li><li> <strong>Mnemonic skills</strong>. The more you try to remember, the better you know how to remember things fast and for long. Mnemonic skills can be developed in dedicated courses. They can also improve with each single <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> you formulate and memorize.</li><li> <strong>Speed-reading skills</strong>. Fast reading is a hallmark of incremental learning. Traditional speed-reading is very different from speed-reading with SuperMemo. You nearly never need to worry about missing information. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> carries none of the burdens of a typical hit-and-miss speed-reading. There is no limit on the speed of skimming. Mastery of keyboard is as important as the eye <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" rel="nofollow">saccades</a>. The more you skim, the better you skim. The more you hurry, the more you skim. Incremental learning accelerates your hunger for knowledge, and the speed at which you devour it.</li><li> <strong>Semantic skills</strong>. The language is a jigsaw puzzle of words and phrases played on a set board of grammar. Understanding the language is vital for speed-reading where the structure of a sentence needs to be parsed in a fraction of a millisecond at a single glance. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, correct formulation of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> will often require minor rewording. Like in a puzzle, you will need to shift a word from here to there, remove sections of sentences, insert context, change the tense, remove referential ambiguity, etc. Mastery of the grammatical sentence skeleton and the semantics will increase with every and each new <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a> polished for long-term memory.</li><li> <strong>Prioritizations skills</strong>. New students, however smart, are often totally blind to the priority of knowledge. They are unable to judge the extent of their present and future knowledge. They find it difficult to differentiate gold from garbage. Seemingly precious knowledge becomes garbage if it does not pass the priority test that ensures it can ever be mastered. The lifetime capacity of the human brain is limited. Without understanding the limits, newcomers to incremental learning will often embark onto a futile quest for mastering details that would steal room needed for memories that are essential to one&#39;s existence (professional and beyond). With every passing month and with the constant increase in the size of your knowledge and your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> (i.e. also &#34;knowledge to-be&#34;), you will better understand your ultimate limits. Your knowledge selection skills will keep improving for years to come.</li><li> <strong>Editing and SuperMemo skills</strong>. SuperMemo is complex. It takes months to fully explore. SuperMemo is also keyboard-oriented. The list of keyboard shortcuts is overwhelming. Only with the mastery of the keyboard and SuperMemo itself can you become a true pro of incremental learning who can whiz through dozens of articles per hour. You will edit dozens of little pieces of texts to optimally formulate your questions. Speed-reading and semantic skills, combined with editing skills will help you instantly mold the texts in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> to suit your long-term goals.</li></ul><h3> <span id="Knowledge_database"> Knowledge database </span></h3><p>Once your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> grows rich in materials from various domains, you can use it before you use <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow">Google</a> to search for information about a subject within the material that you already want to learn. The search results will not be as rich, but they will be far more focused on the areas of your interest. While doing <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/review.htm#Search_and_review">search&amp;review</a>, you will be able to reduce the future workload in many areas. This is fun!</p><h3> <span id="All-in-one_archive"> All-in-one archive </span></h3><p>Once you become proficient with SuperMemo you can use it as an all-encompasing archive of all your media files. Those files do not need to be part of the learning process, however, you can combine archiving functions with the incremental process (e.g. when annotating your family photo album <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a>). SuperMemo may be a great way to get rid of those dusty paper documents, tape recorder cassettes, CDs, photo albums, school notebooks, etc. You can archive this in dedicated folders on your computer and import it all to SuperMemo. Incremental processing of archive has many advantages. For example, while annotating family pictures from two centuries ago, you can fill in the gaps in information by simple face recognition that may rely on a degree of learning or creative juxtaposition of photographs from different sources in close <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a>. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_audio">Incremental audio</a> can also convert your jukebox SuperMemo into a stream of music with a maximized fun factor. There are millions of ways of sorting tracks on your media player device, by filename, by date, by annotation, by priority, by recent viewing... all that does not compare to the incremental review process. This is because the quality of your experience when processing music or photos is based on the same forgetting mechanisms that affect learning. You want to see or listen to some things more often than others, but not too often. Forgetting is the key to experiencing music or imagery or videos again and again with a heightened degree of fun, pleasure and, last but not least, learning.</p><h3> <span id="Fun"> Fun </span></h3><p>The sense of productivity might be one of the most satisfying emotions. This is why incremental learning should be highly enjoyable. This only magnifies its powers. To experience the elation of incremental learning, you may need a few months of focused practice. You will first have to start with the basic tools and techniques. Then you will need to master <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">knowledge representation skills</a>. Finally, you will need a couple of months of heavy-load incremental learning to perfect the details and develop your own &#34;incremental learning philosophy&#34;. You will also need to grow your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> as size matters for the fun of learning. Last but not least, incremental learning requires good language skills, some touch-typing skills, and patience (SuperMemo will often want you to go against your own intuition). Although the material is originally imported from electronic sources, it always needs to be molded, shortened, provided with context clues, restructured for wording and grammar, etc. The skills involved are not trivial and require practice.</p><p>If you have used SuperMemo and/or <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>, you may have concluded that learning with SuperMemo is boring due to its repetitive nature. Those who can compare the classic SuperMemo with incremental learning will testify that incremental learning is by far more fun. In contrast to classic SuperMemo, where you focus on the review of the old material, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> interweaves the old with the new. Novelty adds to the fun and efficiency of learning. Incremental learning is by far more challenging and colorful than typical repetitions. In addition to review and reading, you can import rich graphics, audio and video to spice up your learning process.</p><p>In the end, you risk becoming seriously addicted to incremental learning. The statement &#34;<em>I do not read books</em>&#34; should no longer be considered in a negative light! As long as you keep incremental learning in rational check, it will benefit you and others around you.</p><h2> <span id="Disadvantages"> Disadvantages </span></h2><p>Most of disadvantages of incremental learning come from factors that are a disadvantage in nearly all human pursuits: opportunity and overhead costs. However, there are also disadvantages that come from the fact that <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/il.htm#Incremental_learning_is_not_for_everyone">Incremental learning is not for everyone</a>. Poor selection of knowledge may result in wasting time on low-quality learning. Moreover, incremental learning may lead to frustration, stress, addiction, compulsive use, and other undesirable effects on user&#39;s psychology.</p><p>Here is the short list of disadvantages to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>opportunity costs</strong>: each time you learn with SuperMemo, you are not doing something else. You might be neglecting your creative pursuits, other people, your children, your own health, etc. Incremental learning makes sense only if it is done in the right proportion to your other activities. That proportion will depend on your skills, goals, profession, lifestyle, personality, and more. You need to strike the optimum balance on your own. It might be just a few minutes to polish your English or professional knowledge. Or it might be a few hours if you are a medical student. You always need to keep opportunity costs in mind and keep a score of costs and benefits.</li><li><strong>overhead costs</strong>: there is no way around a steep learning curve in incremental learning. You will be thwarted by limitations of software, and the overall complexity of the concept. You will wonder why some solutions in SuperMemo have been set upside down against your best intuition. You will keep improving your skills, and strategies over long months and years. Even mastering the basic techniques will take a lot of time. You should be aware of that difficulty before you embark on the process that is bound to cause some stress and frustration at the beginning. At the same time, you should find hope in the fact that for a pro, the overhead costs are negligible. All extra operations are semi-automatic while the learning process proceeds largely uninterrupted in student&#39;s mind. While keystrokes are issued, knowledge is actively being processed by the memory system. All operations have been optimized for pro use. Once you get to a pro level and follow the recommended strategy, overhead cost disadvantage will cease to matter.</li><li><strong>learning garbage</strong> (GIGO): if your selection of learning material is poor, or your formulation skills inadequate, you risk wasting lots of time on learning things that you do not need or that do not bring a tangible memory effect. This is why you must read <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">20 rules of formulating knowledge</a>, keep <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/il.htm#Selecting_knowledge">knowledge selection</a> at the front of your mind, and be honest with your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a>.</li><li><strong>frustration and stress</strong>: incremental learning is not for everyone. It requires a certain level of proficiency with the language that may be hard for some to reach. It requires a mind that is somewhat abstract-enabled. Did you do well in math? Or science? These are good omens. If incremental learning is not fun after a few months of determined study, you need to re-read this entire article with utmost attention. Otherwise, your incremental adventure will not bring fruit.</li></ul><p><strong>Incremental learning must be fun to work!</strong></p><h2> <span id="Incremental_reading:_Summary"> Incremental reading: Summary </span></h2><ul><li> If you are serious about learning, you must learn <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>!

With all <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Child">child elements</a> produced from a given text marked with references, you would never need to worry about losing the context of the question. </p><p>For example: </p><div><p><strong>Q</strong>: He was born in <span>[...](year)</span></p></div><p>cannot be answered without the context. However, the following question is already easier to understand: </p><div><div><p><strong>Q</strong>: He was born in <span>[...](year)</span> </p><hr/><p><span>#Title: Barrack Obama</span></p></div></div><p>To speed up learning, in the incremental reading process, the above question should naturally be replaced with: </p><div><p><strong>Q</strong>: Obama was born in <span>[...](year)</span></p></div><p>or </p><div><div><p><strong>Q</strong>: Obama was born in <span>[...](year)</span> </p><hr/><p><span>#Title: Barrack Obama</span></p></div></div><p>References are not stored in HTML files that hold your articles but in a reference <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Registry">registry</a> (i.e. in a separate database). The reference registry does not hold the text of references either. All reference texts are held in the text <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Registry">registry</a> and are available for global text searches. In earlier versions of SuperMemo, each text would keep its own copy of references. In newer SuperMemos, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> keep only pointers to reference <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Registry">registry</a>, which in turn keeps pointers to individual text fields in the text registry. As a result, many <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> can hold the same reference, and many references can hold the same text. This results in a significant saving in space in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a>. More importantly, you can update the reference in a single <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> and see the change show in all <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> using the same reference. This way, you do not need to waste time on search&amp;replace to correct a single misspelling or reference inaccuracy that propagated to many <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a>.</p><h2> <span id="Example"> Example </span></h2><p>If you select the title of the source article and press <em>Alt+T</em> (<strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/compmenu.htm#Reference">Reference</a> : Title</strong> on the HTML <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/compmenu.htm">component menu</a>), each <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extract</a> will be marked by the title of the source article.

This way you can accomplish a good memory effect at little processing effort. However, many users fall into traps of inefficiency where too little or too much work is done on a subject in a single review.</p><h3> <span id="Futile_review"> Futile review </span></h3><p>Futile review is an example of insufficient work done (one action, zero memory). Futile review is born in this mental scenario: you see a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a> and think: <em>I am in no mood for this material now. Let&#39;s execute <strong>Next repetition</strong>.</em> This is wrong! You must take action or you will loop into wasting time and learning little! It is a cardinal sin to execute processing operations without actually learning anything. When a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a> arrives, you may have a dozen of excuses: &#34;<em>I do not like this one. Let&#39;s do it tomorrow</em>&#34;. Or &#34;<em>I am too sleepy for this one</em>&#34;. Or &#34;<em>This one will take too much time.</em>&#34; If you find yourself in a loop and constantly rescheduling the same <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a>, or spending time rescheduling a number of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a>, you are hurting the efficiency of learning! This is the time that could be spent on more productive steps.</p><p>If you do not want <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> to become a waste of time, you must <strong>always take some action</strong> when you see a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a>. For example:</p><ul><li> read a sentence and delete it, or mark as <span>ignore</span>, or extract it</li><li> if the article is not vital for your further progress, set low <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> (e.g. 99%)</li><li> for the material that you won&#39;t have time for in a month or more, set the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">interval</a> (e.g. to 333 days)</li></ul><p>In other words, either make tiny inroads into the text, or mark it clearly as low priority or to-be-done later. Consider also <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/elmenu.htm#Delete_element">Delete</a></strong> or <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/elmenu.htm#Done">Done!</a></strong></p><h3> <span id="Item_perfectionism"> Item perfectionism </span></h3><p>Another facet of the same problem is taking too many actions on a single piece of information. It is highly inefficient to work on colors, fonts, pictures, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priorities</a>, etc. during a single repetition. All those actions can be spread over time. Naturally, setting the right <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> is one of the most important steps. Perhaps a piece of information is not important enough to ever squeeze through your crowded learning. If so, you will save tons of time on not doing colors and styles.</p><p>Here also you should remember: <strong>one memory, one action</strong>. Each time you review a piece of information, you are allowed to do an edit, font change, template change, concept group change, etc. However, unless you can do all your actions in a single burst of machine gun keyboard strikes, or unless some actions are associated with learning new things, you should rather limit your actions to a single step per single repetition.</p><p><strong>One memory, one action</strong> rule demands that <strong>every operation in incremental learning should leave a trace in your memory</strong>. It also says that <strong>one operation on a piece of data is better than two operations at the same time</strong></p><h3> <span id="Example:_incremental_item_structuring"> Example: incremental item structuring </span></h3><p>The following <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> may look like a violation of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">20 rules</a>:</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: Inflammation is produced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosanoid" rel="nofollow">eicosanoids</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytokine" rel="nofollow">cytokines</a>.

Incremental learning is incremental across the spectrum of rules and principles. In particular, formulating <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> and building understanding are incremental too.</p><p>According to the <strong>one memory, one action</strong> principle, the presented <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> will assume its final shape some time in the undefined future (or never, if its <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> is not high enough). It must be processed incrementally due to the following factors:</p><ol><li> incremental build up of comprehension, and</li><li> incremental reformulation that requires time.</li></ol><p>The <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">20 rules</a> say &#34;<strong>Do not memorize until you understand</strong>&#34;, however, understanding is also an incremental process. Converting this <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> to plain &#34;<em>What eicosanoids attract white blood cells?</em>&#34; might make sense only if the student fully understands and remembers the hierarchy of inflammation factors, and involved eicosanoids. If this is not the case, carrying the context in the shape of this complex <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> is a form of transitional stage between a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a> and an <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a>. The <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> still asks the question vital for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Active_recall">active recall</a>. However, it also makes sure that full context is provided until the rest of the knowledge structure is firmly established in student&#39;s mind. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, the order of reading is often chaotic, the understanding is incremental, and the effort to build a solid knowledge structure is gradual too.</p><p>In addition to the incremental buildup of comprehension, extensive edits of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> are costly (esp. a total rewrite of the item to a plain question). In fact, one of the main advantages of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is the minimum need for typing. This is why we use electronic sources in the first place (instead of just books that offer no disadvantage when entire <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> are typed in anyway). This is why an important efficiency principle in incremental learning is to minimize edits by complying with the <strong>one memory, one action</strong> principle.</p><p>Let us see how the presented <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> might evolve in successive repetitions. Note that all edit steps my proceed only with solidification of related knowledge (i.e. a single repetition may actually bring no edits at all). The execution of those steps will also be somewhat dependent on item <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>. High priority items will receive more exposure, more processing and will demand better formulation quality.</p><h4> <span id="Take_1:_original_complex_item"> Take 1: original complex item </span></h4><div><p><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/7/78/SuperMemo_Commander.jpg"><img alt="SuperMemo: A cloze deletion whose formulation is improved incrementally over many repetitions in accordance with the principle: &#34;one memory, one action&#34;" src="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/thumb/7/78/SuperMemo_Commander.jpg/800px-SuperMemo_Commander.jpg" width="800" height="355"/></a></p><blockquote><em><strong>Figure</strong>: A <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> related to inflammation, with a formulation that seems to violate the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">20 rules</a>.

It is hard to remember the whole set of countries that belong to the European Union. When learning lists, you should rather decompose the problem into smaller subproblems.</p><p>Let us consider an example in which you want to memorize the entire sequence of letters in the alphabet. It won&#39;t be very effective if you use the following item:</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: What is the sequence of letters in the alphabet?</blockquote><p>You will notice that you frequently stumble on parts of the sequence and need to stop repetitions just to exercise the entire sequence in the traditional way (like we all learn poems by rote).</p><p>However, you can approach this in a way that guarantees quick effects:</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: What is the sequence of letters in the alphabet between A and E?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: What is the sequence of letters in the alphabet between D and H?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: What is the sequence of letters in the alphabet between G and K?</blockquote><blockquote>etc. etc.</blockquote><p>After 2-3 weeks of repetitions, you may take on an extra task of recalling the whole sequence after each repetition of these simplified <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>. This will make sure you can recite the entire alphabet quickly. You will also frequently rehearse that parts of the sequence that are harder for your memory (e.g. <em>V, W, X, Y, Z</em>) as opposed to those that are much simpler (e.g. <em>A, B, C, D, E</em>).</p><h3> <span id="Practical_problems_with_memorizing_lists"> Practical problems with memorizing lists </span></h3><p>You may develop a good methodology for memorizing lists in SuperMemo. However, you may later discover that the memorized lists are not very useful in real life, or worse, your memory may fail you when you undergo a baptism of fire. You already know that list should not form an answer to a question. In a list A, B, C, SuperMemo needs to separately understand your difficulties with linking A and B, B and C, etc. You can use <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> to learn lists using multiple <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>.

In such cases, you will need even more work by formulating <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>: A-B (where A is the question and B is the answer), A-C, B-A, B-C, C-A, and C-B. Although you will get six <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> instead of one, you knowledge is likely to be more solid and you may actually spend less time on repetitions of those multiple <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> than on repetitions of the conglomerate A-B-C item</p><h3> <span id="Lists_can_often_be_ignored"> Lists can often be ignored </span></h3><p>In a majority of cases, we do not need to learn lists at all.

However, for understanding the subject, you do not really need to remember how many factors affect mental illness. You primarily need to remember the relationship between the cause and the effect. If you ignore the enumeration, you can simply produce the following <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a> that will each be easy to process further:</p><blockquote><ul><li> <em>Mental illness is becoming an increasing problem</em></li><li> <em>Increases in life expectancy have brought increased numbers of certain chronic mental illnesses</em></li><li> <em>Because more people are living into old age, more people are suffering from dementia</em></li><li> <em>Rates of depression are rising throughout the world</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>If you believe that you cannot live without the enumeration, you can first extract the facts listed above, and then simplify the enumeration by deleting all superfluous information:</p><blockquote><em>Mental illness is increasing for 2 reasons:</em><ol><li> <em>increases in life expectancy have brought increased chronic illnesses</em></li><li> <em>rates of depression are rising</em></li></ol></blockquote><h3> <span id="Using_Decompose"> Using Decompose </span></h3><p>Little known but very useful function in SuperMemo can help you tackle lists.</p><p>If you are learning the names of fruits, you might see a text like this:</p><blockquote><em>Examples of fruits are apples, oranges, pears, cherries, banana...</em></blockquote><p>You do not want to memorize the whole list of fruits, esp. that the longer it gets the more likely you are to fail. There is no definite or complete list of fruits that would make a good memorization target.

That main collection should be enriched daily by new imports of articles and multimedia from various sources. Keeping your knowledge in a single <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> is vital for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/review.htm">subset review</a>, searching for knowledge and references, searching for pictures, statistics, progress monitoring, import defaults, etc. SuperMemo provides a rich set of tools for handling disparate areas of knowledge in a single continuous learning process. However, in certain situations, you may create separate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collections</a> for various purposes.

SuperMemo does not support PDF natively. This has always made PDF materials harder to process than ordinary HTML text imported from the web.</p><p>There are 4 approaches that are most often used to process PDF incrementally. You will need to see which one is best for your particular material. It may happen that you will need to resort to mixed strategies and use different approaches to different texts. The 4 options are:</p><ul><li> <strong><a href="#PDF_to_HTML_converters">Converters</a></strong>: using PDF to HTML converters to generate HTML text that can be read in SuperMemo</li><li> <strong><a href="#PDF_with_visual_learning">Pictures</a></strong>: using page snapshots (e.g. with <strong>Print Screen</strong>) and employing <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/visual.htm">visual learning</a></li><li> <strong><a href="#PDF_copy_and_paste">Manual</a></strong>: using copy and paste to copy PDF to SuperMemo page by page (or picture by picture)</li><li> <strong><a href="#Incremental_PDF">Incremental</a></strong>: using an incremental approach to read-copy-and-paste while working with PDF in Adobe Reader called from SuperMemo</li></ul><p>Conversion to HTML is most convenient and least expensive. However, some converters and/or some PDFs produce HTML that is quite different than the original, and/or difficult to process in SuperMemo (e.g. requiring extra filtering, or extra manual formatting). Page snapshots are a fast way to read and import pages that are difficult to convert or are read only (e.g. manuals that require a specific page layout). Copy and paste approach is best for articles that can easily be selected in their entirety and which do not contain too many pictures. Finally, the incremental approach is most natural for SuperMemo, however, instead of using <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Read-point">read-points</a>, the student needs to make a note where he or she stopped reading the text.</p><p>For more solutions, see: <a href="http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/PDF" rel="nofollow">PDF at SuperMemopedia</a>.</p><h3> <span id="PDF_to_HTML_converters"> PDF to HTML converters </span></h3><p>As SuperMemo cannot host PDF files natively for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, the most promising long-term solution is the use of PDF to HTML converters. However, all converters have their limitations. The languages defined by HTML and PDF are not equivalent. Not all expressions of PDF can be expressed in HTML. This is why you need to check a few converters and see which one is best at processing your type of learning material.</p><h4> <span id="Conversion"> Conversion </span></h4><p>Here is a short list of converters as compiled at <a href="http://supermemopedia.com" rel="nofollow">SuperMemoPedia</a>:</p><ul><li> <a href="http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/PDF_to_HTML_converters" rel="nofollow">PDF to HTML converters</a></li></ul><p>If you are not sure which one to choose, you might use this one: <a href="http://www.pdfonline.com/" rel="nofollow">PDF online</a> (it keeps a limit of 2 MB on the size of files to convert).</p><h4> <span id="Processing"> Processing </span></h4><p>Once texts are imported to SuperMemo, they may need further processing:</p><ul><li> filter problematic code with <em>F6</em> (e.g. bulletizing tables)</li><li> import pictures (some pictures are text-like constructs that need to be snapped with copy&amp;paste)</li><li> split into manageable portions (e.g. with the help of <strong>Split: Split the article</strong> in the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/commander.htm"><strong>Commander</strong></a>)</li><li> convert portions of text to plain text with <em>Ctrl+Shift+F12</em> (in cases of most unfriendly formatting)</li></ul><h4> <span id="Using_MS_Word"> Using MS Word </span></h4><p>Some students use MS Word as an intermediary stage in conversion to HTML. However, as much as the conversion of PDF to HTML is never complete and accurate, there are differences between PDF and MS Word that make lifedifficult. At the moment of writing, there aren&#39;t any tools that would reliably convert PDF to MS Word format. Pasting from Adobe Reader to MS Word yields poor results (e.g. texts in columns lose or mix portions of texts). If you own MS Word, you can give it a try, however, using converters or <a href="#Incremental_reading_of_PDF_articles">other methods</a> will probably work better.</p><h4> <span id="Using_OCR"> Using OCR </span></h4><p>Some users swear by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition" rel="nofollow">OCR</a>. See: <a href="http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/PDF_and_OCR" rel="nofollow">Using OCR to convert PDF for SuperMemo</a>.</p><h3> <span id="PDF_with_visual_learning"> PDF with visual learning </span></h3><p>You can convert PDF to pictures and employ the tools of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/visual.htm">visual learning</a>.</p><p>Here are the steps:</p><ol><li> convert PDF to pictures either by saving as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG" rel="nofollow">JPEG</a>, or by using page snapshots with <strong>Print Screen</strong></li><li> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/visual.htm#Pasting_pictures_from_the_clipboard">paste pictures</a> to SuperMemo or <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/visual.htm#Importing_pictures_from_a_local_drive">import pictures from a local drive</a></li><li> as pictures are not searchable, it is important to copy&amp;paste a part of article (if possible) that could later be used in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/review.htm#Search_and_review">search and review</a>. For example, abstracts of scholarly articles with necessary reference tags (<span>#Title</span>, <span>#Author</span>, <span>#Source</span>, etc.)</li><li> use <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/visual.htm">visual learning</a> to process the imported materials. Pictures will need to be trimmed (e.g. (1) <em>Alt+click</em>, (2) marquee selection of the interesting part, (3) press <em>Esc</em>, and (4) choose <em>Permanently cut/crop the zoomed/trimmed image file</em>). Use visual <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> (<em>Alt+X</em>) to focus on smaller portions of imported articles</li><li> annotate the pictures or write down summaries to further process most important portions with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. Without the use of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a>, imported material may quickly be forgotten.</li></ol><p>This method of reading PDF is analogous to <a href="#Incremental_reading_of_paper_articles">incremental reading of paper materials</a>.</p><p>See more at <a href="http://supermemopedia.com" rel="nofollow">SuperMemoPedia</a>: <a href="http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/PDF_and_Visual_Learning" rel="nofollow">PDF and Visual Learning</a>.</p><h3> <span id="PDF_copy_and_paste"> PDF copy and paste </span></h3><p>If <a href="#PDF_to_HTML_converters">conversion of PDF to HTML</a> is not satisfactory, you may need to resort to old plain copy&amp;paste. Some PDF texts paste whole chapters pretty well with little extra text/code (e.g. page headings). Some PDFs respond well to <em>Ctrl+A</em> (for selecting all text) and <strong>Copy with Formatting</strong> (right click). Usually, Adobe Reader will not let you do multi-page selections that would paste to SuperMemo fast and nicely. You may even get annoyed with your attempts to copy a multi-column portion of a single page. You will get one column selected, middle of the second, and the ending of the third. Other double-column texts will paste as a mix of both columns per line. Sometimes pasting multi-column texts is not possible. This means that you will often need to go from page to page, or even column to column, and repeat copy&amp;paste. That can take ages. Similarly, pictures do not copy as part of HTML. So you need to copy&amp;paste pictures separately. Here again, when Adobe Reader will not let you copy pictures easily, you can just use <strong>Print Screen</strong>, paste to SuperMemo and trim&amp;crop in SuperMemo (see: <a href="#PDF_with_visual_learning">Visual learning</a>). Tables are usually best processed in the form of pictures as they usually import poorly to HTML. Some PDF documents do not even allow of selecting texts. In those cases you will need to resort to <a href="#PDF_with_visual_learning">PDF visual learning</a> too. Sometimes you may just give up and read the article straight without bothering to do it incrementally, or look for alternative texts, or just give up reading altogether. You can also read the article using traditional methods, and copy to SuperMemo only the portions that you would normally extract within SuperMemo.</p><p>After pasting text from Adobe Reader to SuperMemo, it will often be jagged, disrupted, wrongly formatted, etc. Converting short passages to plain text often dramatically improves readability. The shortcut is <em>Ctrl+Shift+F12</em>.</p><p>For more, see: <a href="http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/PDF_Copy_and_Paste" rel="nofollow">PDF Copy and Paste</a></p><h3> <span id="Incremental_PDF"> Incremental PDF </span></h3><p>If you want to work incrementally with PDF articles, you can use the following strategy:</p><ol><li> Save your PDF files to a dedicated folder</li><li> Import them regularly with <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/file.htm">File</a> : <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/file.htm#Import">Import</a> : Files and folders</strong></li><li> Define a PDF <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Template">template</a> with a large <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/html.htm">HTML component</a> and a tiny binary <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Component">component</a> for holding PDF (use that template as the default for the import <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Concept_group">concept group</a>, or apply it after import to all PDF articles)</li><li> When reading is scheduled for the PDF element, click the binary <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Component">component</a> and jump to the page where you last finished reading (to automatically go back to the last viewed pages, in Adobe Reader, check <strong>Edit : Preferences : Documents : Restore last view settings when reopening documents</strong>)</li><li> Paste all important fragments of the PDF document to the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/html.htm">HTML component</a> (if texts cannot be selected, use the <strong>Print Screen</strong> option, paste the picture, and use <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/visual.htm">visual learning</a> tools to extract individual fragments)</li><li> Paste figures to SuperMemo by clicking a selected picture, right-clicking, and choosing <strong>Copy Image</strong> in Adobe Reader or <strong>Print Screen</strong>.

Even though we strongly believe it might spell a revolution in learning, its present incarnation will reach only a small fraction of society. This is why:</p><ul><li> Most of people will never arrive to this website. A great part of this planet do not have access to the Internet. Of those who are privileged enough to be able to use <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow">Google</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> on a regular basis, most are too busy with work, family and other pursuits. The rest are busy with <a href="http://facebook.com" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>, games and other &#34;blessings&#34; of the Internet.</li><li> A significant fraction of the users of the Internet realize that the web offers incredible self-help opportunities. However, a substantial portion of those will suffer from a cognitive bias known as the <strong>illusion of knowledge</strong>. This bias does not spare highly intelligent individuals. Under the illusion of knowledge, we are less motivated to seek more learning. </li><li> Users of the Internet who are highly interested in learning quickly discover that their memory can be improved, and that their learning can be advanced to a new level with some help from the net or software. However, the language barrier is another big sieve. The best materials about learning techniques have been published in English. Language divisions result in a global inequality in the access to information. You can read about SuperMemo in a couple of major languages. Perhaps you might learn about <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> too. The article you are reading now will take months or years to percolate to non-English areas of the net!</li><li> For anyone interested in learning, it does not take long to find out about <em><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a></em>. The term was quite exotic when first used in the context of SuperMemo in the mid 1990s. In those days it could only be found in a couple of scientific publications. However, it was SuperMemo that helped popularize the concept, which now has entered the popular culture. Those who seek better memory will quickly be informed that <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> is the way. They will get their introduction to <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> from <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/english/down.htm">SuperMemo freeware</a>, or an array of other excellent free spaced repetition applications, some of which use older SuperMemo algorithms. The fact that the newest SuperMemo is a commercial product will prevent many potentially excellent students from ever going in the direction of incremental learning. This must made be clear then. At the moment of writing, <a href="http://www.freewarefiles.com/SuperMemo_program_13849.html" rel="nofollow">SuperMemo 2004 is freeware</a> and supports <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. It might be missing the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a>, but this will matter only much later in the process when you build a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> of unmanageable size.

That&#39;s the core of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>!</li><li> Among users of SuperMemo, only a fraction will ever become interested in a complex concept of incremental learning (probably still below 5%). A typical newcomer is more likely to drop out altogether than to move on to the next level. The chief culprit is the incompatibility of SuperMemo with the human nature and the modern lifestyle. Stressful and busy lives do not help in forging new paths and acquiring new habits. It is not just that humans like to live in their comfort zones. It is also that the pressures of the modern dog-eat-dog society are pretty effective in stifling higher inspiration, lifelong learning, creative pursuits beyond one&#39;s job, etc. Those issues are inherent (human nature), or systemic. As such they cannot be easily remedied.</li><li> Some users might hold a relatively positive opinion about <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, but will excuse their lack of commitment by technological limitations of SuperMemo. For example, &#34;<em>unless you give me a Mac version, I won&#39;t go there</em>&#34;, &#34;<em>I hate Internet Explorer</em>&#34;, &#34;<em>Your interface comes from Windows 98 era</em>&#34; or &#34;<em>I will come back if you have a mobile version</em>&#34;. Incidentally, there is an inherent incompatibility between mobility and incremental learning. Mobility correlates with multitasking and low attention (interaction with others, social media notifications, arriving mail, phone calls, browser pop-ups, etc.). The power of incremental learning lies in balancing creativity with attention. As such, incremental learning is inherently immobile (unless you understand mobility as a transfer between two or more peaceful and static environments). In addition, without a standard-size keyboard, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> might feel like paddling up the creek.</li><li> Among those users of SuperMemo who get down to reading about incremental learning, a large proportion will come with a preconceived goal: proving that incremental learning is not really worth the investment of time. &#34;Negative reading&#34; is more likely to occur in a bad state of mind: low-spirits, irritation, or reading outside one&#39;s <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Optimizing_the_timing_of_brainwork">optimum circadian brainwork bracket</a>. This preconception may be largely subconscious and based on a defense mechanism: proving that incremental learning is a weak concept is easy, should save one a great deal of investment in mastering the concept, and prevent the need to leave one&#39;s comfort zone. Discovering that incremental learning is a must will simply augur long hours of plodding through the documentation that is notorious for its poor readability index. The presented article is harder to read than 70% of articles at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>. The ultimate judgement is strongly correlated with your present state of mind. You are more likely to say &#34;<em>Incremental learning is full of fluff</em>&#34; or &#34;<em>Incremental learning goes against human nature</em>&#34; than to say &#34;<em>I have discovered a new great technology that will change my life</em>&#34;. You might be just seeking affirmation of your preset frame of mind: &#34;<em>Incremental learning must be a hoax or at least a waste of time</em>&#34;, or simply &#34;<em>Incremental learning is not of much use in my particular profession</em>&#34;. It is easy to find the desired confirmation. Imperfections in this article will provide a rich material for dismissal. A perfection is not achievable. Prejudiced mind will always find a way to misinterpret. Naturally, if you are enthusiastic about incremental learning at your first encounter, this is a very good predictor of your ultimate success.</li><li> Having passed all this rich obstacle course, you are now bound to be in a tiny group of people who arrived at this point. The good news is that you might be part of a special elite. People with fertile minds who are open to new challenges, motivated well enough and self-disciplined enough. Naturally, you might have equally well come here exhausted with your failure in learning, in hope of finding a remedy to your recent bad exam results. Whatever the answer, the road is still very long. Even with a brisk mind and great enthusiasm, you may still drop out at later stages.</li><li> When reading about incremental learning, you might hit another major obstacle: &#34;<em>This is more convoluted than I thought!</em>&#34;, or &#34;<em>The whole idea of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/priority.htm">prioritization</a> makes me nauseous</em>&#34;, or &#34;<em>The toolset may be rich but is it natural?</em>&#34;. You can get discouraged either by incomplete understanding of the concept, or the incompatibility of the concept with your personality.</li><li> If you have already decided to try incremental learning, and you have <a href="http://super-memo.com/supermemo17.html" rel="nofollow">SuperMemo 17</a> installed, you may get an unpleasant shock. <a href="http://super-memo.com/supermemo17.html" rel="nofollow">SuperMemo 17</a> is not user friendly! It has been optimized for pro users and only simplified enough at lower levels (<strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/file.htm">File</a> : <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/levels.htm">Level</a></strong>) to make it somewhat palatable for a novice. You can overcome this impression only with a firm belief: incremental learning works and it is worth the investment of my time. After a year, you may love the solutions you hated in SuperMemo at first. User unfriendliness and complexity will make many give up in the first days or weeks. Those dropouts rarely return! We are guilty here too. New solutions are never perfectly encapsulated and/or interfaced. You will get your neat iPad and Android version only when incremental learning is more popular, which is not anytime soon.</li><li> The dropout rate in the first weeks is still high. Some of the main problems: importing unsuitable text, difficulty in parsing the text with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a>, losing context of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a>, comprehension problems (not related to SuperMemo), <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozing</a> texts that are too complex, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">difficulty in formulating items</a>, excessive time spent on formatting and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Template">templates</a>, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Overload">learning overload</a>, confusion, problems with SuperMemo (e.g. layouts), lack of sense of progress, etc. Without clear gratification, many users come to the conclusion that the cost is greater than the benefits. They are not wrong. It is not easy to get a return on your investment in a month or even longer. Few users start their learning swiftly on a wave of solid enthusiasm!</li><li> Many of the advantages of incremental learning rely on the size of your learning <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a>. The value of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/review.htm#Search_and_review">search&amp;review</a> increases with the size of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a>. At the beginning of the process, when <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> is small, and as a result knowledge-poor, you may feel like laying the first brick of a large pyramid on a vast boring desert. The greatest fun can be found at the top of the pyramid, when you can see the extent of your knowledge in a good perspective. This metaphor should not imply your pyramid will ever stop growing. You keep adding stone blocks to the sides. The pyramid keeps growing high and wide for lifetime.</li><li> The extent of failure does not only cover the dropouts and the never-has-beens. Even long-term users may enter a never-ending struggle with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">knowledge formulation</a>, complex material, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priorities</a>, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Overload">overload</a>, etc. The later you start, the longer the transition from pain to fun. Old habits die hard. There is one clear litmus test for success: once incremental learning is fun, you know you do things right. If you have not reached the level of fun after a couple of months of trying hard, you need to re-think your strategies. For example, you may need to start from reading this article cover-to-cover again.</li><li> If you happen to be a happy user of incremental learning, your knowledge will keep growing fast, and your hunger for learning will keep increasing at an ever faster rate. This makes you a part of a very tiny elite. This also imposes an obligation. It is time to help others reach your level!</li></ul><h2> <span id="Big_picture_in_incremental_learning"> Big picture in incremental learning </span></h2><p>A frequent reservation voiced by skeptical observers is that dismembering texts into little units will result in an inevitable loss of the ability to see things from a distance in their entirety. The question is: <em>Does incremental learning produce a loss of the big picture?</em> What the skeptics fail to appreciate is the power of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> that stands behind SuperMemo. The SuperMemo method ensures high <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> of once-mastered knowledge. This means that there is minimum disintegration of the coherence of knowledge once it is understood and well modeled in student&#39;s mind.</p><p><strong>The main advantage of SuperMemo is that you convert lots of disparate pieces of information into a solid model of reality that lives in your memory</strong>. All these pieces can be dispersed randomly in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, however, they fit into a coherent entirety that stays firmly intact in your mind. In other words, incremental learning is reductionist at the level of knowledge processing, but is holistic at the level of memories stored in your brain.</p><p>The big picture worry comes from the fact that in traditional education, students rely heavily on their short-term memory. They cram a single subject intensely before an exam only to forget most of that knowledge in the following months unless the subject is reviewed in later courses. It is true that short-term memory can act as a glue that holds the big picture in memory. However, it is the short-term memory and the weakest long-term memories that are gone first. With that in mind, it is only natural that you might worry that if you start intermingling more than a few courses, you will end up with chaos and confusion. It is not the case with incremental learning. New memories, once established, are gradually reinforced to permanently enter the long-term storage. All incremental learning does is to help you focus on a small portion of the material at any given moment.</p><p><strong>In traditional (unspaced) education, the big picture is maintained with the glue of short-term memories. As such it is volatile, and subject to forgetting. In incremental learning, the big picture has a lasting value!</strong></p><p>Worrying about the big picture in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is as if you worried that you might forget the structure of your family just because you meet too many members at the same time at a big family occasion, or that you might forget your name when focusing too much on spelling its individual letters. Once the big picture resides in your long-term memory, you can play with details to your heart&#39;s content. Today, tomorrow, or in a couple of years.</p><h2> <span id="Incremental_learning_can_make_you_smarter"> Incremental learning can make you smarter </span></h2><p>User of classical SuperMemo, T. Sz. wondered:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>Incremental learning is just a few years old. For example, incremental reading was introduced in 2000. The essential concept of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/priority.htm">priority queue</a> was introduced only in 2006. Without the priority queue, massive learning may lead to massive chaos. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/video.htm">Incremental video</a> was born in 2009. So you won&#39;t find users with 20 years of experience.</p><h3> <span id="Incremental_learning_is_faster"> Incremental learning is faster </span></h3><p>Despite the young age of incremental learning, it is easy to theorize about its power. This is because learning incrementally isn&#39;t much different than its ultimate effect as other forms of learning (e.g. extensive reading, studying for the university, research, etc.). For that reason, the results will be comparable. The main difference is that you will get to the levels of higher knowledge much faster (assuming sufficient skills). This way, someone with a few months of intense incremental learning, may get the knowledge and act not much different than a university graduate. Naturally, incremental learning will not substitute for laboratory practice, problem solving, discussions with friends, and professors, etc. So there will be differences. You can then ask: <em>How does the university education make me into a better person?&#39;</em>. Once you answer that question, you will have an answer about incremental learning.</p><h3> <span id="No_amount_of_learning_can_eliminate_ignorance"> No amount of learning can eliminate ignorance </span></h3><p>If you hope that incremental reading will make you universally knowledgeable and smart, you are wrong. Human knowledge is vast enough for a 2-year-old to know things that a PhD does not know (esp. if the kid is trained for the trick, e.g. to answer &#34;<em>What is the capital of Burkina Faso?</em>&#34;).</p><h3> <span id="Incremental_readers_are_different"> Incremental readers are different </span></h3><p>Incremental reading is more likely to be less focused and more general. At the university, you may learn extensively on a specific subject, while in incremental reading you are more likely to stray to multiple related areas depending on your interests and the encountered gaps in knowledge. Your priorities will reflect your individual profile and your knowledge may be far more customized to your own needs and passions. All in all, an incremental reader will not differ much from a well-learned person. The main difference may show in personality. Not because of incremental learning but due to the fact that only a few have the mental characteristics needed to get interested and then sustain the incremental reading process. Thus incremental readers may appear more knowledgeable just because of their natural curiosity or even obsession with knowledge. This quest for general knowledge may result in short moments of amazement with the gaps in knowledge exhibited by other people. In September 2013, scientists announced that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1" rel="nofollow">Voyager 1</a> entered the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium" rel="nofollow">interstellar medium</a>. A panel of high-IQ journalists on a respected news channel discussed that historic moment. One of the journalists mentioned that Voyager 1 was launched in the 1990s and has now left the solar system. The other journalists nodded. This is where an obsessive incremental reader may pause and realize that he or she is indeed a bit different.</p><h3> <span id="Nobody_likes_a_smart_aleck"> Nobody likes a smart aleck </span></h3><p>It is not how others perceive you that matters, but how you change your thinking and the ability to solve problems. In most cases, few people in your surroundings care about your problems and your goals. The knowledge you obtain for those goals will be of little interest to others (beyond a narrow circle of close friends). If you ever attempt to show off at parties, you will rather be politely dismissed as an annoyance. Being a <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smart%20aleck" rel="nofollow">smart aleck</a> is universally perceived in a negative light. If you shine with your knowledge in a relevant context (i.e. not for the sake of shining), the perception will be different. We all love the doctor that can provide an accurate diagnosis at a glance and instantly come up with a solution to your health problem. However, chances are rather slim that you will be able to show off your specialist knowledge at a party (unless it is a professional party of your colleagues in the field).</p><h3> <span id="Reward_in_higher_awareness"> Reward in higher awareness </span></h3><p>The greatest advantage of incremental reading may show in the areas of general knowledge. These are the areas that most of people neglect due to a simple lack of time and lack of sufficient pressure or motivation. A student may need to study for his geography course, a medical researcher may need to read dozens of papers, but they both may have too little time or need to refresh the ABC of physics that might otherwise be useful in understanding things that happen around them. An obsessive incremental reader might therefore reach a sort of higher level of awareness. If you hear about a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Chaffinch" rel="nofollow">chaffinch</a> for the first time in your life, you might likely say &#34;<em>I have never seen that bird</em>&#34;. However, you might then be amazed if you see the bird a few times in the course of the following week.</p><p>With a narrow focus, few people are able to point to the galaxies that are likely to collide with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way" rel="nofollow">Milky Way</a>. Knowledge and understanding of similar facts and processes may seem to have little application to daily activities, however, it does seem to change how people view their place in the universe. Ignorance is blind. Knowledge makes you see things that others do not see. That should be sufficient reward.</p><h3> <span id="Smart_learning_makes_you_smarter"> Smart learning makes you smarter </span></h3><p>As explained in <a href="http://supermemo.com/articles/genius.htm">Roots of Genius and Creativity</a>: <a href="http://supermemo.com/articles/genius.htm#Smart%20and%20dumb%20learning">Smart and dumb learning</a>, smart learning will help you get smarter. However, bad learning practices can result in a monumental waste of time. SuperMemo helps you eliminate the problem of forgetting. As such, it can also help you remember time-wasting garbage. The main rule of smart learning is: <strong>learn what is highly applicable</strong>. Learn things that change your life. Learning things that help you change the life of others. Rules are better than facts. You can employ probability or statistical formulas in dozens of contexts. If you memorize phone numbers, it won&#39;t make you much smarter.</p><h3> <span id="Incremental_learning_can_make_you_dumber"> Incremental learning can make you dumber </span></h3><p>We believe that incremental learning is the acme of learning in 2013. However, it can also make you dumber. If you take on heavy learning, you are bound to suffer from serious memory interference. This means that you will also forget much faster, esp. the things that you do not keep in SuperMemo. Instead of looking smarter, to the outside world, you might appear more forgetful and even absent-minded. You might forget events, promises, encounters, jokes, movies, and all those little memory things that we take for granted. Incidentally, this forgetfulness is also produced by <a href="http://facebook.com" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>, and the like. In this chaotic modern world, we hardly ever have time to stop and ponder important things. These days you can buy a shower cabin or a sauna with speakers built in. It&#39;s a matter of time before you can engage into a conversation with your toilet. Perhaps you already chat with your Facebook friends while sitting on the toilet? This means that the last preserves of peaceful thinking and creativity are in danger of being swamped with information overload. This makes us smarter in a different way. However, without your rational intervention, it may work against your long-term success. The same is true about incremental learning, you must stay vigilant and learn only things that are highly relevant and applicable to your goals and your position in society. Turn off your phone in the night, leave your MP3 player at home when you go for a jogging, and keep your incremental reading in check and order.</p><h3> <span id="Understanding_your_own_ignorance"> Understanding your own ignorance </span></h3><p>Incremental learning helps you quantify your knowledge. If you do incremental learning, this might be your most distinguishing feature: <strong>you know what you do not know and why. You better understand the limitations of human memory and its value!</strong></p><h2> <span id="Knowledge_that_makes_you_smarter"> Knowledge that makes you smarter </span></h2><h3> <span id="Smart_and_dumb_learning"> Smart and dumb learning </span></h3><p>Not all knowledge is of great value. Memorizing all tributaries of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a> may take precious time from other areas of learning. Unless you are an expert on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_River" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_forest" rel="nofollow">rain forest</a>, geography, Indian tribes or related areas, you would rather not want to begin your incremental learning experience from that Amazon exercise.</p><p>Your learning efforts must be based on high applicability of newly acquired skills and knowledge. If you memorize the whole phone book, your problem solving ability will increase only slightly (mostly through the beneficial effect of memory training on the health of your brain). On the other hand, a simple formula for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_payoff" rel="nofollow">expected payoff</a> may affect all decisions you make in problem solving and in life in general. It can, for example, save you years of wasted investment in lottery tickets. Millions of people are enticed with huge lottery jackpots, yet they would never agree to give up their whole income for life in order to get it back at retirement in one-off payment, which is a frequent probabilistic payoff equivalent of taking part in lotteries. Using the terminology defined above, you will find most benefit in mastering and understanding highly abstract rules of logical thinking and decision making.</p><p>To accomplish smart learning, you will need to constantly pay utmost attention to what material you decide to study. You must avoid short-term gratification at the cost of long-term learning. It may be great fun to learn all Roman emperors and details of their interesting lives and rule. However, unless you study with a big picture in mind (e.g. in an attempt to understand why civilizations thrive or fall), you may benefit less than by struggling through less entertaining but highly applicable formulas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_research" rel="nofollow">operation research</a>, which might, for example help you optimize your diet, investment, daily schedule, etc. In other words, <strong>you cannot be guided by just the fun of learning but by your goals and needs</strong>. In time, you will learn to see the link between long-term learning and long-term benefits. You will simply condition yourself to love beneficial learning. Hard study material can still provide instant gratification.</p><p>While you focus on your goals, you cannot forget about the overall context of human life. You cannot dig solely into studying car engines only because this happens to be your profession. This would put you at risk of developing a tunnel vision. You might spend years improving a liquid fuel engine efficiency while others would leap years by getting involved in lithium batteries or hydrogen engines. One of the main reasons for which companies go bankrupt is that their leadership fails to spot the change. As corporate darwinism eliminates short-sighted teams, future society will witness more and more intellectual darwinism. To understand the trends and the future, you need to study human nature, economics, sociology, history, neurophysiology, mathematics, computing sciences, and more. The more you lick, the stronger your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm#Predicting%20the%20future">predictive powers</a> and your problem solving capacity and the creative strength.</p><p>Should we learn &#34;trivia&#34; such as &#34;<em>Which year was the Internet born?</em>&#34;. <strong>The concept of trivia is highly relative!</strong> To a child in a kindergarten, the birth of the Internet is rather meaningless. At this stage of development, the child may find it difficult to grasp the concept of the Internet itself. Many parents will wait until the primary school before showing a web browser to their child. The value of putting the date on the birth of the Internet probably develops only in the context of an effort to understand the history of technological development. In this context, 1969 may be as important as the name of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm#Johannes%20Gutenberg">Gutenberg</a>. Only when multiple events of the 1960s and the 1970s dovetail together, the commissioning of ARPANET becomes meaningful. When we figure out that we landed the man on the moon before making the first connection via the net, 1969 looms larger. If we dig deeper, we may find it inspiring to know that when Charley Kline tried to log in on October 29, 1969, the network crashed as he typed the letter <em>G</em>. Imagine, you work on commissioning a major installation that you have worked on for several years. You know that the installation implements revolutionary concepts yet it keeps on crashing. You are about to lose heart. This may not necessarily be an emotional event, after all you also need to apply probability to deciding when to give up blind-alley pursuits even after years of investment. The juxtaposition of the small letter <em>G</em> and the groundbreaking concept of the interconnected world will help you see the big picture. If your concept is great enough, you will go on through another 100 crashes in hope of diagnosing the reason. That perseverance may seem to have little to do with &#34;being smart&#34;, but it will make you into a winner (given a bit of luck).</p><p>Listen to other people&#39;s advice and valuations. The younger you are the more you should listen. In the end though, <strong>it must be you who determines the criteria for sifting golden knowledge from trivia</strong>. Only you can measure the value of knowledge in the light of your own goals.</p><p>Remember that not all knowledge can easily be formulated in a declarative manner. Remember then to use the power of your own neural networks: solve problems, practice your skills, compute, abstract, associate, etc. You and others may not be able to see or verbalize some rules but your brain will extract them in the course of practice. Once the rules have been developed, try to formulate them and write them down. This can be of benefit to you and others.</p><h3> <span id="Knowledge_that_assists_problem_solving"> Knowledge that assists problem solving </span></h3><p>Problem solving in artificial intelligence can be used to mimic those mental faculties of a human being that we associate with intelligence and creativity. There are many approaches to problem solving such as deduction, induction, abduction, reasoning by analogy or probabilistic methods, neural networks approach, searching in state space, and more. And even though some of these can generate false conclusions or uncertain responses, they can all be expressed by means of deductive methods such as those used in theorem proving in mathematics. Deduction proceeds from axioms or premises towards true formulas or assertions through logical derivation using valid inference rules. The better the selection of assertions and the selection of inference rules, the broader the reasoning capacity of an expert system or human brain. Rich inferential knowledge stored in our memory makes us fast in thinking, creative, intelligent, efficient in problem solving, etc. Yet we need factual knowledge as the raw processing material for derivation. Even the creative vein and inspiration can be expressed in terms of multithreaded derivation and backtracking well formalized in logic programming. No magic fluids or reflections of the soul are involved here. Just a plain network of firing neurons recovering the encoded patterns of facts and rules. See also: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">Roots of creativity and genius</a>.</p><p>To boost your problem solving capacity you need to master a great deal of inferential knowledge. If you learn about specific classes of problems to solve, you may need to choose between memorizing the outcome of inference or its individual steps. Both equip you with a formula for transforming knowledge into new quality. Learning derivation steps is costly. At the same time it can equip you with highly abstract derivation rules. You need to balance cost and benefit. We cannot blindly assume that it is better to derive answers to problems than to simply memorize the answers. In problems with multiple instances, we will tend to learn the derivation. For example, it is easier to learn how to derive the third power of X than to memorize all useful pairs: argument-result. On the other hand, most of people memorize the multiplication table at the time when they could still derive the result from bit-operations on binary numbers. Memorizing some 40 or so combinations seems more practicable, esp. that derivation always takes time and we make use of the multiplication table thousands of times in a lifetime. Here memorization saves hours and days in the lifetime perspective. Brain armed with rich factual and inferential knowledge will associate the most remote ideas and derive the most unexpected conclusions. Through a conscious control over this rich reasoning process, we have built the present civilization.</p><h3> <span id="Knowledge_that_assists_creativity"> Knowledge that assists creativity </span></h3><p>Creativity is based on association of ideas. It is helpful to be born with a creative brain that keeps spewing new ideas in all circumstances. However, creativity can also be assisted. When you master a great deal of facts and rules in areas adjacent to the problem that you try to creatively solve or elaborate upon, your creativity gets enhanced. If you employ incremental learning, the association of random ideas will be a norm throughout the process.</p><p>All innovation in the history of science and technology is based on association. Forgetful memory can be helped with external sources of knowledge and each major scientific breakthrough is based on a series of smaller steps, many of which will be based on hours of search, trial-and-error and experimentation. The brain armed with extensive knowledge is more likely to come up with the needed associations. As in problem solving, inferential knowledge is also particularly valuable in creative efforts. The rules that you know, help you derive new truths, and associate these with all your current knowledge.</p><p>Two ideas do not come together to produce a great invention unless they sit in the same head. They either have to be called up at the same time or one has to come unexpectedly from the outside:</p><ul><li> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes" rel="nofollow">Archimedes</a> stepped into a bath and immediately associated the fact with all he knew about weight and buoyancy.

It can help you generate new ideas while making repetitions! Creative associations do not come from the mere existence of two pieces of knowledge in your brain. Those two pieces of knowledge have to light up at the same time. Only this way can your brain make a connection. Strangely, a repetition related to genetically modified tomato can light up memories related to tomato juice, cucumbers, genetic disorders, take-home dinner, flu or even the silent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Polar_Lander" rel="nofollow">Mars Polar Lander</a>.

However, in the long perspective, the role of human learning will be lessened by the development of artificial intelligence.</p><h3> <span id="Knowledge_and_history"> Knowledge and history </span></h3><p>Throughout the ages, knowledge was the cornerstone of human progress. From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Age" rel="nofollow">Stone Age</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age" rel="nofollow">Information Age</a>, in pain, we have built a tiny oasis of civilization in ruthless expanses of the evolving universe. The history of the mankind is made of billions of individual lives that keep on sparking and fading. Born of self-preservation instincts imprinted by evolution, history books paint a picture of a constant string of wars, conflict of interest, loss and gain of influences, lust for power and submission to weaknesses of human nature. On the other hand, the greatest achievement of the evolution, the rational mind, kept on contributing to new findings, discoveries, technologies and philosophies. Progress has always hinged on discovering new truths and preserving them for posterity in form of stories, solutions, tools, books, and other carriers of information. Knowledge is the basis of human power, yet it constantly struggles with two forces that regularly diminish it: death and forgetting. We can preserve knowledge in books and other forms of information storage. However, this knowledge translates to value only then when it is used by the creative power of the human brain. The limitations of the human brain will remain a bottleneck of progress for many years to come. We will develop artificially intelligent knowledge processors not earlier than in a decade or two.</p><h3> <span id="Knowledge_and_death"> Knowledge and death </span></h3><p>Death poses an ageless challenge to educating new generations. Years of hard work needed to gain knowledge on professorial level are obliterated in a single act of death. Newborns need to go through years of education before they are able to access, read, and comprehend this text. They all have to struggle with basic literacy skills, lessons of safe sex and teen pregnancy, lessons on superiority of altruism over egoism, the difference between wise and not-so-wise choices, existential questions, etc. Although constant reeducation may contribute to gaining a fresh perspective in each generation, it is also painfully wasteful. As yet, there is no efficient remedy to the death of knowledge. All we can do is to attach more weight to healthy lifestyle and health research. Those two promote longevity of knowledge in a single generation.</p><h3> <span id="Knowledge_and_forgetting"> Knowledge and forgetting </span></h3><p>Forgetting is a natural process that makes it possible to efficiently use the limited memory space of the brain. We forget to dispose of knowledge deemed less important in order to make space for knowledge of higher importance. Currently we have only a limited control over what we remember and what we forget. Today, the most important tool that we can use to prevent forgetting is practice. We can minimize time needed for practice by using <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> (i.e. learning technique based on computing optimum <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> between repetitions). <strong>Spaced repetition is the key to maximizing knowledge within a single human lifetime</strong>.</p><h3> <span id="Immortal_knowledge"> Immortal knowledge </span></h3><p>Artificial intelligence is our best hope for approaching immortal knowledge. It can nearly eliminate the problem of death (except for the heat death of the universe or factors that we cannot foresee today, e.g. the collapse of space, and the like). Artificial intelligence can also eliminate the problem of forgetting (at least within the bounds of the available storage). Some forgetting is needed to shape crisp associative knowledge, but that is a welcome phenomenon that leads to more applicable knowledge. Despite great hopes we might have about artificial intelligence, the best path towards immortal knowledge must still rely today on the use of the human brain. This is why we believe that incremental learning is so vital for further human progress.</p><h2> <span id="Incremental_reading_is_an_extension_of_traditional_book_reading"> Incremental reading is an extension of traditional book reading </span></h2><p>Someone remarked: &#34;<em>If Gutenberg was a blessing then <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> might be a curse!</em>&#34;. Is incremental reading an attack on traditional books? If you read in pieces and with endless interruption, does it not destroy the storyline?</p><p>Whether <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is a curse or a blessing depends on the way it is employed. There is no sharp transition between traditional reading and incremental reading. In the simplest case, you can use <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> exactly in the same way as you would read a book. Partitioning of texts and interruptions are not compulsory. You can read the entire text from top to the bottom without a single interruption. This would make sense if you needed a storyline for context, and did not want to bother with committing it to long-term memory. If you do take breaks or skip portions of texts or change the natural sequence of reading, it all happens in situations that have their counterparts in the world of books:</p><ul><li> <strong>Interruptions</strong>: you can read an entire book in a single evening, but very often you take breaks and read a book in portions on a daily basis. You may even put it back on a shelf in a busy period and return after a few weeks</li><li> <strong>Multiple subjects</strong>: it is not unusual to read more than one book in parallel. You may pick one that matches your mood for a given evening, or read portions of different books on the same day</li><li> <strong>Changing the sequence of reading</strong>: many readers are tempted to peek at the end of the book for its ending. Or browse back to earlier chapters to check some details that failed to register in prior reading</li><li> <strong>Deleting portions of the book</strong>: deleting portions of the text in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is analogous to dropping them from your memory through forgetting once you read a book. The book is still on the shelf, the original electronic article may still exist in your archive, but your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> or your memory retain only highlights that may get sparser as weeks go by. Years after the original reading you may retain only single quotes or golden thoughts. The rest is gone</li></ul><p>In other words, in extreme cases, there may be no difference between traditional and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. Gutenberg&#39;s blessing is safe. If you believe interruptions or multiplicity of subjects are beneficial, you can employ them at greater ease that it is the case with book reading. At the other extreme, you may wish to take on thousands of independent articles, make interruptions a norm, focus your reading only on portions that you deem most important, etc.</p><p>A rule of the thumb is: use traditional reading when you read stories or you read for enjoyment. Use <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> to process learning material, textbooks, notes, or scientific literature that you need to remember for life (or at least for many months).</p><h2> <span id="Knowledge_acquisition:_Areas_of_optimization"> Knowledge acquisition: Areas of optimization </span></h2><p>There are seven main areas where the learning process can be enhanced. Incremental learning plays a role in each, however, the first two areas will benefit only through your growing experience, and ability to quantify your progress:</p><ol><li> <strong>access to knowledge</strong>: with the advent of the world wide web, we all have information literally at our fingertips. Searching for knowledge with <a href="http://google.com" rel="nofollow">Google</a> is fast, easy and accurate. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> is the biggest encyclopedia in human history. Access to knowledge is no longer a bottleneck of human learning. It virtually became a non issue!  Web&#39;s quality and role will continue increasing exponentially as more and more people appreciate its potential and contribute to its growth. There are still many complementary sources of information that compete successfully with the Internet. However, it is only a question of time before you will be safely able to rely on the Internet as your sole source of information. The great benefit of reading the web, as opposed to reading the books, is that the hypertext nature of the web enforces a very compact and usually self-explaining nature of individual articles. A jump to a randomly selected page in an average book will leave you confused due to the context-dependence of the material. On the other hand, it is less likely the same confusion will trouble you in a random jump to a selected page of an equivalent material placed on the web. Web authors usually put more effort to add contexts to the page (at least in the form of hyperlinks). In other words, it is easier to build quality knowledge by reading single pages of the web than by reading single pages of paper books. We are getting closer to the ideals of incremental life-long learning as opposed to thorough-review learning which for many ends with the end of school years. In the busy days of modern society, few can afford a thorough review of their rusty knowledge in individual fields. It is much easier to fix the gaps incrementally: today an article on the structure of the atom, tomorrow an article on a healthy diet, etc. And all that strictly adjusted to individual&#39;s interests and professional priorities</li><li> <strong>selecting knowledge</strong>: you will face the need to fill the gaps in your knowledge in many more areas than your time permits or your memory makes possible. You can ask SuperMemo to help you scrupulously note down and prioritize all areas of knowledge that need an enhancement! In SuperMemo, you are the master of what you learn and what you neglect. Your ability to select valuable information will grow in proportion to the acquired knowledge. Incremental learning helps you quantify your knowledge and extrapolate into the future. This will help you be more selective in choosing your learning materials.</li><li> <strong>reading</strong>: this is the first stage where knowledge makes an actual intimate contact with the brain. Traditionally, it is streamed into memory in a more or less linear manner (i.e. paragraph after paragraph). Incremental learning helps you delinearize this process and optimize reading by enhancing <strong>knowledge selection and prioritization</strong> concurrently with reading. For example, you should be able to say &#34;<em>This paragraph can be processed later</em>&#34; or &#34;<em>This paragraph requires utmost attention right now</em>&#34; or &#34;<em>This paragraph can be skipped for good even if I decide to read the article again</em>&#34; or &#34;<em>I want to read this paragraph again in three days and in more detail</em>&#34; or &#34;<em>I want to mark this paragraph with lower priority and come to it only after all higher priority paragraphs have been processed</em>&#34;, etc. </li><li> <strong>representing knowledge</strong>: the way in which you present knowledge will affect comprehension and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> (i.e. how well you remember). Things that are simple are easier to understand. Things that are simple are also easier to remember. Many people do not realize the degree to which simplicity can affect learning. Many people doubt that even the most complex material can be presented in a very simple way. Einstein noticed that &#34;<em>it should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid</em>&#34;</li><li> <strong>remembering knowledge</strong>: SuperMemo helps you eliminate the problem of forgetting. You will base all learning on <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> that SuperMemo pioneered almost 30 years ago. SuperMemo produces immense savings in time by scheduling review of the studied material only then when the review is necessary (see: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/smintro.htm">Introduction to SuperMemo</a>)</li><li> <strong>life cycle of knowledge</strong>: knowledge in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> and in your memory keeps on evolving and maturing. This will involve continual rewording, reprioritizing, and re-associating pieces of knowledge. You will often give up portions of knowledge that become outdated or lose their high-priority status. You will apply the rules of knowledge representation that will make knowledge easy to remember. Your knowledge will also become more associative in time. In other words, it will become a more suitable ground for making intelligent choices </li><li> <strong>using knowledge</strong>: knowledge translates to value when it is properly used. In the long-run, skills discussed in this article will indirectly help you become more creative and skillful in using your own knowledge. Not surprisingly, your skills needed to efficiently use knowledge are also part of knowledge itself and tend to grow spontaneously as your knowledge increases</li></ol><h2> <span id="Cost-Benefit_Analysis"> Cost-Benefit Analysis </span></h2><h3> <span id="Cost_of_knowledge"> Cost of knowledge </span></h3><p>Each piece of knowledge stored in SuperMemo adds to the total cost of learning in terms of time. If knowledge is <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">well-formulated</a>, we can estimate that a single element will be repeated from 8-20 times in a lifetime. If a single repetition time falls in the range from 3 seconds to 15 seconds, we could conclude that the expected lifetime cost of a single item ranges from 24 seconds to 5 minutes. SuperMemo has a statistical measure called <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/statistics.htm#Cost">Cost</a></strong>. It measures the total time cost of a single memorized element. In a well-managed long-term learning process, this cost is usually estimated at 2-3 minutes/item in a 10-year bracket. This is then more than the theoretical prediction due to the fact that each collection contains a small subset of so-called <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Leech">leeches</a> which dramatically increase the average cost/item (note that <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Leech">leeches</a> can easily be <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/leech.htm">detected and removed</a> from the learning process).The rational criterion for deciding if a piece of knowledge should be memorized by means of SuperMemo is to judge the benefits of having the given piece constantly available in memory. If the benefits do not seem to add up to more than 10 minutes, the student might simply not add an item to SuperMemo. With a dose of practice, this analysis becomes a semi-automatic process, and should painlessly blend with your life</p><p>The cost-benefit criterion is: <strong>if costs of not knowing a piece of knowledge is greater than the cost of repetitions in a given period of time, add this piece of knowledge to SuperMemo</strong> (otherwise do not addit, or relegate it to lower priority).</p><h3> <span id="Cost_of_items"> Cost of items </span></h3><p>Cost of a single <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">well-structured</a> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> in lifetime ranges roughly from 24 seconds to 5 minutes. At any given moment it may be approximated for a 30-year bracket, by multiplying <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/eldata.htm#Repetitions">Repetitions</a> : Future</strong> (in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/eldata.htm"><strong>Element data</strong> window</a>) by <strong>Avg time</strong> (in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/statistics.htm">learning statistics</a>). SuperMemo displays this value in the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/eldata.htm"><strong>Element data</strong> window</a>. If your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> is ill-structured (i.e. difficult to remember), this cost may bloat! To eliminate ill-structured <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> use <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/leech.htm">leech analysis</a>.</p><h3> <span id="Benefit"> Benefit </span></h3><p>Each piece of knowledge in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collections</a> should be associated with a tangible benefit. Only <strong>you</strong> can accurately guess the value. For example, the value of memorizing the opening hours of your gym in a given time might be approximated by multiplying (1) the probability you will choose wrong hours by (2) the time-cost of missing the gym. For example, if you believe that the probability is 25% and the cost of choosing wrong hours is 40 minutes, the cost of knowing the opening hours is around 10 minutes. In such a case, memorizing the opening hours will be cheaper than missing the gym. However, if the probability is sufficiently low or the time loss sufficiently small, you should not add opening hours to SuperMemo. For example, if the probability is 10% and time loss is 3 minutes, you are not likely to recover your learning investment! There are naturally less clear-cut cases in-between. If you are not sure if you should add a piece of knowledge to SuperMemo, add it with sufficiently low <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>. With overflow tools (e.g. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Auto-postpone">auto-postpone</a>, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Auto-sort">auto-sort</a>, etc.), you can drag along less valuable pieces of knowledge at little cost.</p><h3> <span id="Priorities"> Priorities </span></h3><p>You will quickly realize that there are awfully many pieces of information that pass the cost-benefit criterion. You cannot ever hope to learn all this information. This is actually optimistic. This means that with a good selection of knowledge, you can gain far more than just a few minutes on memorizing the gym hours. You may gain untold hours by learning things that transform your life. Your best tool in making sure you always focus on the most beneficial material is to use the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a>. If you have too many <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> to remember, those of lower <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> will get a less meticulous treatment and will carry a higher probability of forgetting. However, this also means that they will benefit from the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a> and you will learn more of such <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> at higher speed (despite lower <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a>).</p><h2> <span id="Selecting_knowledge"> Selecting knowledge </span></h2><p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress" rel="nofollow">Library of Congress</a> holds 10 terabytes of printed materials.

That qualification tells you that reading is not a panacea, and that making reading smart is vital. With the advent of the web, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>, blogosphere, and other sources of knowledge, access to information is easier than ever. This also means that information becomes more overwhelming. There are always too many things to read. And it is hard to select from a myriad of essential sources.

Search the web for solutions for book selection, and you will literally find dozens of blogs with advice. However, most of the advice is based on volatile skills that are hard to master. You need to become an expert in book selection, in speed-reading, in skimming, in skim-or-read decisions, in highlight-and-review strategies, in margin notes and in underlines.

Is complex knowledge based on just &#34;remembering passages&#34; or does it go well beyond it. Any form of interruption or delay while working on many things in parallel can potentially slow down this process. Many people believe that <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is good for cramming, but not for serious learning, esp. when complex subject matter is concerned.</p><h3> <span id="Example_Opinion_1:_tackling_quantum_mechanics"> Example Opinion 1: tackling quantum mechanics </span></h3><p>Here is an example opinion of someone who never tried incremental learning:</p><blockquote><em>I believe that <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> (IR) may slow down or hamper learning complex subjects that require deeper understanding -- as opposed to superficial remembering. From what I&#39;m told, in IR, the student spends but a few seconds on a passage related to one subject, and then jumps to another, completely unrelated subject. Such switching among disparate subjects makes it difficult, if not impossible, to engage in deeper thoughts and thus to discover deeper truths beyond the superficial remembering of passages. When I read, I look for concepts and methods that underlie the necessarily descriptive language used to convey them, and I try to imagine their applicability in my other pursuits. In other words, discovering deeper truths requires deeper thoughts. The latter are difficult to reach if only a few seconds are spent on a subject at a time. As a practical aside, technical papers in hard sciences and engineering are peppered with notational inconsistencies among different authors, different research groups, and different journals. The same symbols may mean different things in different scientific papers. Similarly, different authors may use different symbols to denote the same quantity. Sometimes the differences are gross and easy to spot, and sometimes they are only subtle. When reading one paper at a time, the reader familiarizes him/herself with the terminology and notation, and can follow the line of reasoning while recognizing the subtleties. Having a few dozen (or hundreds!) articles read in parallel, frequently switching among them, creates a nightmare scenario of confusion where the meaning is lost in the jungle of various notations and subtle terminology differences. This makes it impossible to follow the line of reasoning in any one of the papers. Below are a couple of (imperfect) metaphors that may convey the sense of loss when trying to apply IR to learning complex subjects and to discovering deeper truths:</em><ol><li> <em>If you are a wine connoisseur, imagine that you are only allowed to smell the wine, but that you are not allowed to drink it, or even to put it in your mouth. How good would your knowledge of wine be? With practice, you would probably learn to distinguish various wineries, age, etc. You may even be more efficient at it, and be able to do it in record time. Yet, I venture a guess that you would feel something missing, that you would feel somehow cheated, that you would feel that you don&#39;t know all that there is to know about wine. And rightfully so. Same with IR. You just &#39;smell&#39; the knowledge, but you never &#39;taste&#39; it. It may be enough if your goal is to learn a foreign language. But some areas require that you dig deeper if you want the real insight, the real truth.</em></li><li> <em>Physical exercise. A well-rounded routine has both cardiovascular and resistance training elements to it. IR is like having only the high-intensity cardio. Sure, if you stick with cardio, after a while you will be able to deliver a small package across town in record time -- and that may be all you aspire to. However, it will not give you the upper body strength to help move a 400-kg optics bench. Same with IR: you may impress your audience with the breadth of your knowledge, but you will have to leave the heavy intellectual lifting to others.</em></li></ol></blockquote><p>The above reasoning can easily be proven false. We can imagine two extremes:</p><ul><li> all learning is done using traditional textbook processing with all the academic arsenal of teachers, practise, reasoning, interaction, labwork, and more</li><li> all learning is purely incremental with no breaks for free thought, calculations on the margin, walking around, conversation, etc.</li></ul><p>It is easy to show that both are flawed. For example, traditional learning is deprived of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>, while pure incremental learning may be seen as deprived of conversation or lab practise. Clearly, the optimum falls somewhere in the mix between the two extremes. <strong>Incremental learning is a supplementary tool in well-rounded education</strong>. It is not supposed to monopolize your day and your thinking. It should not be seen as a replacement, but as an enhancement. As such, it is up to you to find your optimum.</p><p><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> is all you want it to be. It can be speed-reading, cram-reading, or mass-reading. It all depends on the priority criteria which you choose. For that reasons, it would be best described as a reading management technique. As such it is indispensable independent of the complexity of the studied matter. On one hand, you can speed-read articles faster than in conventional speed-reading and yet leave vital paragraphs for future review. On the other hand, you can meticulously dismantle individual paragraphs and convert them into classical questions-answers material that will stay with you for ever. In addition, you can freely manipulate the volume of the material flowing into the reading/learning process. You can focus on a hundred most important articles or you can opt for thousands. Naturally, in the latter case, your time allocation for individual articles will be minute. For example, if you import 10,000 articles to SuperMemo, you might end up with 50,000 to 100,000 <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> within a year of 1-hour daily reading. In such circumstances, low priority articles will indeed linger for months in the process. Naturally, this is exactly the purpose of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>: focus on what is important without neglecting anything that falls within your area of interest. If your focus changes, you can use search and navigation tools to speed up the review of most important portions of your reading material.</p><p><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> is universal in textbook learning. Whatever complex concepts you need to analyze, and whatever computations you need to make on the margins, you can do in parallel with incremental reading of the textbook (assuming you have an electronic version). An old rule says: whatever you need to remember for life (or at least months), process incrementally (to improve memory, boost understanding, and save time in the long term). Whatever you need at the moment, for the sake of understanding the subject, process in bulk (non-incrementally). By combining the two, you can get the most of your learning.</p><p>Metaphorically, a pencil is a useful tool that can enhance your life. You will not want to replace your computer with a pencil, or use a pencil while cooking. However, you can still enhance your life by having the pencil handy. Needless to say, we believe, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is far more useful than a pencil.</p><p>The presented reasoning is not only wrong, it is also based on a few misconceptions about incremental learning:</p><ul><li> It is not true that, in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you spend only a few seconds on each <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a>. The time depends on your needs. It may be a few seconds or it can be an entire day (e.g. before an exam, when doing research, or when being consumed with one&#39;s learning passions)</li><li> It is conceivable that an incremental reading novice would suffer from the lack of knowledge of the toolset and get lost in the process thus making it more confusing than it is the case with standard textbook learning. Weighing up pros and cons should always consider an ideal case in which the student truly understands the methods of incremental learning. This often takes months of use. The learning process should begin with easier concepts and easier subjects before more complex subjects can be tackled.</li><li> Some research papers are less suitable for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. Papers that require a vast use of working memory or a large investment in short-term memory <strong>are not</strong> suitable for incremental reading. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> is useful each time you study knowledge with lifetime application. Research papers with complex methodology and rich in new specific symbols and notations are not suitable. You should read such papers in your own way and leave just a few notes (&#34;deep thoughts&#34;) in SuperMemo. Use your working memory while it lasts and dump it right after reading. Naturally, for massive learning, you will target texts that produce a minimum discardable burden of short-term memory, i.e. are well-written with concise formulations focused on lifelong value.</li><li> For novices, knowledge acquired with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> may not taste as sweet as for a professional. In the latter case, the &#34;taste&#34; may be exquisite due to a well-established contextual knowledge and solid semantic context that relies strongly on long-term memories. A seasoned incremental reader will have a totally opposite feelings about the wine metaphor. Not only will <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> allow of sensing the intricate fabric of the full spectrum of volatiles. Instead of just a single evening, the taste, aroma and pleasure will last a lifetime!</li><li> The effects of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> will always depend on the goals. If the goal is to impress some audience, it will likely be accomplished. However, if the plan is to do some &#34;heavy intellectual lifting&#34;, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> will provide a rich toolset to enhance that process and provide you with solid long-term knowledge grounding needed for the job.</li></ul><h3> <span id="Example_Opinion_2:_struggling_with_basic_physics"> Example Opinion 2: struggling with basic physics </span></h3><p>Here is another example opinion of someone who tried incremental learning but found it difficult:</p><blockquote><p><em>I think <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is either very difficult or impossible to use when learning some concepts of physics. For example, I have the following text about the Earth and the Sun, how would you handle this with incremental reading?</em></p><p><em>The Earth is moving very very slowly away from the Sun. This happens for two reasons. The first is that the Sun is constantly losing mass because of the solar wind. As the mass of the Sun decreases its pull on the Earth decreases and so the Earth moves slightly further away. The second reason is to do with tidal forces. In exactly the same way that the Moon is slowly moving away from the Earth, the Earth is very slowly moving away from the Sun. In the Earth-Moon case the Moon pulls on the Earth creating tides and slowing the Earth’s rotation very slightly, making the day longer. This action has a reaction - the Moon&#39;s orbit is speeded up. If something travels faster it must move outwards to remain in an orbit and so the Moon slowly drifts away from us at a rate of 3.8 centimeters per year. The same situation happens with the Sun but the Earth’s influence on the Sun is much smaller than the Moon’s influence on the Earth. The result is the Earth’s tiny tiny drift away from the Sun</em></p></blockquote><p>The example isn&#39;t much harder to process than other pieces of knowledge suitable for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. For success in similar cases one needs an encyclopedic text or a degree of editorial effort to dismantle portions of more elaborate prose. The presented example poses two obstacles:</p><ol><li> <strong>Implicit enumeration</strong>. The text mentions two reasons why the Earth moves away from the Sun but it does not name them in an explicit sentence. One needs to read the entire passage to find out the second reason. </li><li> <strong>Explaining by analogy</strong>. The effect of tidal forces on the Sun is explained by describing similar forces created by the Moon. You cannot extract the &#34;second reason&#34; without including and understanding the &#34;<em>Moon example context</em>&#34;.</li></ol><p>Here is how the presented text would be handled with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> (note the editorial effort as well as the need to entirely rephrase one of the sentences):</p><ul><li> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/users/earth_files/index.htm">progress of the incremental reading process</a></li><li> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/users/earth_files/earth.txt">resultant questions and answers</a></li></ul><p>Some authors make <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> very difficult by assuming a great deal of knowledge on the part of the reader or, as it is the case here, loading student&#39;s working memory with a great deal of data rather than building knowledge gradually (i.e. from the ground up). In the discussed example of quantum mechanics, the basic vocabulary needed to process any meaningful text is pretty extensive and capitalizes on many branches of physics and mathematics. In addition, good understanding of all concepts requires a great deal of mathematical practice that goes beyond linear reading.</p><h2> <span id="Incrementalism_and_interruption_are_not_obligatory"> Incrementalism and interruption are not obligatory </span></h2><p>If you love to go through texts from cover to cover without a stop, and always find it hard to stop reading a book before sleep, you may still benefit from <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>.</p><p>There are no incremental readers who did not begin from misgivings about interruption. Paradoxically, <strong>the stronger your misgivings, the better candidate for a good incremental reader you might be</strong>!</p><p>A popular misconception is that there are impatient people who are predisposed to be incremental readers - let&#39;s call them <strong>sippers</strong> - and those who love to devour knowledge in large chunks - let&#39;s call them <strong>gulpers</strong>. The truth is that all creative individuals are of a gulper nature. Incrementalism is both a skill and a habit all gulpers may learn over time.</p><p>Nobody loves SuperMemo as of the first day. It may take a few weeks to notice its power. And still, as we do not have sensors of the speed of forgetting, you need a dose of rational mathematical appreciation of what SuperMemo does to your brain. You cannot easily sense the power of knowledge and how fast it is being undermined by forgetting.</p><p><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> takes far longer to be appreciated than SuperMemo itself. To employ SuperMemo, you need to learn only two operations (<strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/addnew.htm">Add new</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/learn.htm">Learn</a></strong>). For <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you need a toolset that keeps growing and improving over the years of use. Yes! Even after a few years of learning, you will discover new ways you can speed up your own learning with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. It may take a year before you might notice first signs of addiction to <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. A benign form of addiction, mind you, with few negative side effects.</p><p>The paradoxical tendency of &#34;gulpers&#34; to become good incremental readers comes from their hunger for knowledge. The fact that you cannot stop reading is a powerful expression of this hunger and it is the primary driving force that will help you become an addictive reader. What you might be missing still is the understanding of the power of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> and the hunger to &#34;<em>switch for more</em>&#34;. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> will help you develop a hunger for maximizing the value of information you are processing at any given moment.</p><p>You can begin <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> today without ever having to stop reading an article that you find fascinating.</p><p><strong>In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, interrupted reading is a norm, but is NOT obligatory!</strong></p><p>You can read all articles from front to back and only use incremental reading tools for prioritizing articles and extracting most important sentences and converting them to <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a>. In other words, you do not need incrementalism to achieve solid <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> of knowledge. An ordinary web surfer has only two alternatives when encountering an article that seems worth reading: (A) <em>Fascinating, let&#39;s read,</em> and (B) <em>Not fascinating enough. Perhaps I will read some other time</em>. In contrast, an incremental reader can determine the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> of the article and always read only the articles from the top of the current <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority list</a> (perhaps with a user-defined degree of randomization). Moreover, at any time, he or she can say: <em>Interesting, but not as much as I thought. Let&#39;s downgrade the priority and come back later (if ever)</em>.</p><p>A gulper is driven by a natural neural mechanism that underlies all human progress: <strong>curiosity</strong>. The same mechanism can be used to magnify incrementalism: curiosity of what article or paragraph comes next. Once you develop a healthy incremental reading process, you will add another natural neural mechanism: <strong>impatience</strong>. Impatience is also a buttress of progress. We do not like long stretches of low efficiency. We like instant gratification of success and the bigger the success the better. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you are constantly driven by curiosity and yet you itch-to-switch as soon as the text you are reading does not bring sufficient value-per-time. The healthier your incremental reading process, the more value per second you can extract. You will develop a sense of the realistic average value stream, and each time you fall below that expectation, you will add up to the incremental nature of reading (even if the fault is yours, not the text author&#39;s, e.g. when the gaps in your knowledge produce poor comprehension). By combining curiosity with impatience, you can convert from a <em>gulper</em> to a <em>sipper</em>. And still you will be able to read top-quality articles top-to-bottom without interruption. <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> helps you prioritize by content instead of reacting to transient evaluative impressions</strong>.</p><p>You will notice that incremental attitude is a habit you grow as your technical and parsing skills improve. Rarely will you delete lower quality articles, but these will fade in priority and may indefinitely linger in the process. As a result, you will maximize the educational effects of every precious second you spent on learning.</p><p>As an incremental reader, you might gradually develop a dislike of old-style books (as opposed to importable e-books and articles). If you choose to read a book, it is as if you said: &#34;<em>this is the most important reading material in the whole world</em>&#34;. Then the whole series of paragraphs in the book are considered the most important paragraphs to read in their precise sequence as they appear in the book. You give the author of a book God-like powers to stream information into your brain in a flawless, omniscient, and omnipotent way.</p><p><strong>Gulpers and sippers are not biologically different!</strong> The conversion from one to the other goes via the understanding of incremental learning, mastering SuperMemo toolset, honing the skills, self-control, rationalization of the learning process, and gradually pumping up the average value of knowledge streamed into one&#39;s memory.</p><h2> <span id="Incremental_learning_for_perfectionists"> Incremental learning for perfectionists </span></h2><p>If you are a perfectionist, you may initially have problems with accepting the chaos of incremental learning. You may wonder why you should leave your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> unfinished before they look perfectly adorned with fonts, stylesheets, and pictures.</p><p>If you give incremental learning a more determined try, you will understand that the opposite is true: <strong>perfectionists should love incremental learning</strong>! Your perfectionist nature should accept the overriding rule: maximum quality knowledge in minimum time. It is not the beauty of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> that counts, but the beauty of knowledge in your mind. For a skillful student, incremental learning is based on a set of perfectly-formed strict and rigid rules that guarantee the maximum speed of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Acquisition_rate">knowledge acquisition</a>. It is true that some of these rules can make you uneasy at first. If you see a sentence that qualifies for a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a>, the rule is: execute the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> and defer worrying about its exact formulation to its first repetition. The mere choice of the cloze keyword will leave sufficient traces in your memory to qualify as a repetition. In such circumstances, perfecting the formulation of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a> will become art for art&#39;s stake. A higher level rule is: <strong>minimum work for maximum memory effect</strong>. Therefore, you will improve the formulation of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a> as soon as you proceed with the first repetition. And again, you will do only as much work as it is necessary to successfully complete a single repetition act. Again you give up details and frills. Ultimately, your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a> will become perfectly formulated, perfectly prioritized, and perfectly placed in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Knowledge_tree">knowledge tree</a>. Alternatively, it will be deleted or left lingering in your &#34;to do&#34; subset. It is the perfect rules of incremental learning and the perfect learning results that should feed your perfectionist needs, not the perfect &#34;look&#34; of your learning material.</p><p>Many people tend to hold the world wide web in contempt calling it the &#34;human information garbage dump&#34;.

We can adapt our own &#34;perfect rules&#34; for mining the web. Incremental learning uses &#34;perfect rules&#34; to convert web data into golden knowledge. As a perfectionist, you should not worry about the chaos of the web or chaos of your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a>. What really matters is the perfect golden end-result: wisdom!</p><p>Finally, if you still cannot live with imperfectly formulated <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a>, nothing prevents formulating them perfectly. The formulations may be more satisfying to your perception, but you will, naturally, learn at a slower rate.</p><h2> <span id="Incremental_reading_is_not_an_attention_destroyer"> Incremental reading is not an attention destroyer </span></h2><p>In incremental learning, it is very important to make the right choice of the learning material. Many texts or videos are unsuitable for incremental processing. SuperMemo user who never tried incremental learningwrote:</p><blockquote><p><em>It is possible that article structure and quality do matter that much in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> because the real learning bottleneck is the human brain (speed of cortex plasticity)? What if you can only absorb X items of knowledge each day -- if you try to do more, you do something bad to your brain? Here&#39;s one idea: If you overload your brain with new stuff, it won&#39;t have the time to form meaningful connections between the things you know, so your knowledge may be reduced to the ability to answer gameshow-like questions.<br/></em>Solving any significant problem requires periods of prolonged concentration. I fear that an information addiction (200 new tidbits per day) leads to attention deficit. Your brain is used to getting something shiny and new every 15 seconds (a new tweet, new funny pic, new headline, etc.), so when you tell it to work on one thing for 4 hours, it doesn&#39;t listen. I think I was able to concentrate more on one thing in times before Web surfing.<em></em></p><p><em>So, to put a tabloid spin on it, <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> could be the ultimate attention destroyer!!!</strong></em></p></blockquote><p>There is a lot of truth in the above reasoning in reference to attention, memory bottlenecks, &#34;meaningful connections&#34;, etc. However, comparing SuperMemo to <a href="http://twitter.com" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://facebook.com" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a> as used by Internet junkies is very inaccurate! The reward in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is based on quality learning, not &#34;something shiny or something funny&#34;. Naturally, nothing prevents &#34;shiny/funny&#34; things to be imported to SuperMemo. This is why the nature of the ultimate reward will also depend on one&#39;s personality and self-discipline.</p><p>When employed along the recommended rules: <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> should dramatically increase the attention</strong> (as explained in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/read.htm#Advantages_of_incremental_reading">Advantages of incremental learning</a>).</p><h3> <span id="Learning_speed_bottleneck"> Learning speed bottleneck </span></h3><p>Cortex plasticity is indeed the bottleneck in the learning process. All speed-reading and speed-learning efforts may go to naught if you do not employ <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>, which ultimately determines the speed of establishing long-term memories. Remember that in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, the volume of the material may be very high, however, the ultimate number of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> entering the learning process, in the ideal case, is relatively small (usu. 10-20 per day, not 200!). It simply takes lots of time to fish for golden knowledge that will bring best value in the long term.</p><h3> <span id="Overloading_memory_and_the_role_of_sleep"> Overloading memory and the role of sleep </span></h3><p>The existence of the memory bottleneck is the direct consequence of the overload concern. You can overload your learning process with excess information, however, you are unlikely to &#34;overload your long-term memory&#34;. The processes of forgetting and garbage collection executed in sleep have evolved precisely to prevent this problem. However much you try to learn excess facts, forgetting will clean up the excess, and memory optimization in sleep will ensure you develop all necessary &#34;meaningful connections&#34;. Naturally, this will happen only if you get all sleep that you need (i.e. avoid using alarm clock, sleeping pills, staying up late, etc.).</p><p>For more see: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Neural_optimization_in_sleep">Neural optimization in sleep</a></p><h3> <span id="Learning_vs._problem_solving"> Learning vs. problem solving </span></h3><p>It is true that solving problems requires high concentration. However, in the ideal world, you should devote separate time slots to (1) learning and (2) problem solving. In Covey&#39;s terminology, your learning boosts the <em>Production Capacity</em>, while your problem solving time is your <em>Production</em> time. Naturally, you can marry the two slots when problem solving occurs in conditions of information deficit. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> is an ideal tool for such situations. You can combine the inflow of new information with creative efforts and problem solving while retaining maximum focus on the problem at hand.

However, this is more a matter of self-discipline than an inherent problem associated with SuperMemo. It is up to you to decide if you wish to stray to <a href="http://facebook.com" rel="nofollow">Facebook</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> may encourage a degree of straying (e.g. to import supplementary material from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> and/or dictionaries). The whole concept of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a> was developed precisely to counteract the cost of such straying. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> you stray, import, prioritize and... forget (about the excursion to the web). You may visit 20 pages, but instead of wasting time, you import and prioritize. You are back onto your focused path in minutes. The whole process can be under your rational control and the web may become an ally rather than an enemy. Metaphorically speaking, an Internet junkie is constantly distracted with shiny titbits, while incremental reader focuses on fishing for golden knowledge.</p><h3> <span id="Incremental_reading_boosts_attention"> Incremental reading boosts attention </span></h3><p><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> increases attention by letting you focus on a manageable portions of knowledge without feeling overwhelmed, without straying, without getting stuck on harder material, without worrying that you might miss important pieces when speed-reading, etc. Your best way to experience that improvement is to try <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. However, you should know that the effects will not be instant. You will need to invest a lot of time in learning the tools, and then even more time in honing your strategies and learning about your own memory and reasoning. Few incremental readers become truly enthusiastic in their first months of learning.</p><h3> <span id="Article_quality_matters_in_learning"> Article quality matters in learning </span></h3><p>In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you will quickly develop skills needed to instantly differentiate between high quality articles and articles that are full of fluff and wasteful prose. You will indeed fish for catchy headlines, meaningful sections, minimum off-topic commentary, etc. Article quality will determine your ability to employ speed-reading, and to quickly prioritize your material. This has nothing to do with instant gratification obtained from social media, instant news, and other net distractions.</p><h2> <span id="Can_you_really_read_thousands_of_articles_at_the_same_time.3F"> Can you really read thousands of articles at the same time? </span></h2><p>A visitor to <a href="http://super-memory.com" rel="nofollow">super-memory.com</a> commented on incremental learning claims:</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>That skepticism is understandable, and yet we stick with the original claim: you can indeed read thousands of articles at the same time. This is because <em>reading</em> can be understood as a <em>process</em> or as an<em>act</em>. No one can make a sane claim of multiple reading acts at the same time. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, only one article receives a laser focus at any given moment of time. Few students read more than 50 articles in a single day, and they rarely read them all in their entirety. However, they may easily read or skim a few thousand articles in a month, and keep hundreds of thousands of articles in the incremental learning <em>process</em>. In that sense <em>reading thousands of articles at the same time</em> is an accurate if somewhat enticing description.</p><p>To understand <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you need to understand SuperMemo (or <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Repetition_spacing">repetition spacing</a> in general), as well as the effects of intermittent reading on memory. Reading in chunks without the help of the underlying learning process based on <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> indeed makes little sense. However, once you master and understand the techniques of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, you will get the effect opposite to the one expected: not only will you not lose the track of the big picture, you will keep a lasting, durable and coherent memory image of whatever you found important in the processed articles.</p><p><strong>In a well-managed incremental learning process, the big picture is retained in a state of better coherence than it is the case in traditional learning.</strong></p><h2> <span id="Incremental_reading_vs._memory_interference"> Incremental reading vs. memory interference </span></h2><p>You may have read about interference in learning. When students learn two things one after another, they perform worse than in cases where they focus on one thing. This might sound like a reason to disqualify <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> as an effective learning method.</p><p>It is true that interference can ruin learning. If you read about a subject without fully understanding it and follow it with another subject that is confusingly similar in nature, you will indeed perform worse intests. However, this effect is much less pronounced if the first subject is studied with solid comprehension. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> makes it possible to read only as much as you understand. Then it encourages long-term <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> by producing <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>. Finally, it periodically rediscovers weaknesses in the learning process and fills the gap. When well executed, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> produces an opposite effect. It minimizes interference by forcing you to resolve contradiction in your material. It ruthlessly punishes all cases of incomplete understanding. In classroom conditions, you can get a foggy pass at subject A, then worsen the fog by digging into subject B. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, SuperMemo will force you to jump from A to B and back to A until the two form a harmonious body of knowledge with minimum interference and maximum connectivity. Note that the same research on interference produces diametrically different results when the interfering <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a> are subject to continual re-reading. Re-reading is frequent in SuperMemo and multiple active repetition of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> is a norm. The outcome of the experiment may also be obscured by adding a degree of novelty to old reviews which greatly improves attention.

Upon being alerted, one may feel or say, &#34;I was asleep just then,&#34; and such judgments ordinarily are accepted as evidence for identifying a prearousal state as sleep. Such subjective evidence, however, can be at variance with both behavioral classifications and sleep electrophysiology, raising interesting questions about how to define the true measure of sleep. Is sleep determined by objective or subjective evidence alone, or is it determined by some combination of the two? And what is the best way to measure such evidence? More generally, problems in defining sleep arise when evidence for one or more of the several criteria of sleep is lacking or when the evidence generated by available criteria is inconsistent. Do all animals sleep?</em></blockquote><p>This piece begins with an ominous context-buster: &#34;<em>already mentioned</em>&#34;. It poses interesting questions. However, it will take a while for an incremental reader to find cloze keywords that would answer the most essential question of long-term learning: <em>What do I really want to remember for life from the passage I have just read?</em></p><h3> <span id="Simple_English_Wikipedia_is_dangerous"> Simple English Wikipedia is dangerous </span></h3><p>Many users believe that <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Simple English Wikipedia</a> is better for understanding problems than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> itself.

Incremental learning is useful only for long-term memories. The greatest benefits of trying to process news with incremental learning is to realize how transient news is, and to moderate the craving for news by making it &#34;old news&#34; through the incremental approach.</p><p>These are the main reasons why news is a poor candidate for your learning material:</p><ul><li> knowledge that comes with the news is incomplete. If you hear &#34;breaking news&#34;, you know this is about news that is &#34;broken&#34;. It is incomplete and inaccurate. If you ever think of retaining it in your memory for long, come back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> in a week, or in a month, or in a few years. The news becomes most useful when it becomes history. Most of the time, however, it all gets forgotten by the next &#34;news cycle&#34;</li><li> knowledge that comes with the news is contradictory. If you happen to incrementally juxtapose news with old news, you will realize the extent to which people change their minds as new information becomes available. That evolution in thinking and opinion is probably the most interesting part of news.</li><li> knowledge that comes with the news is scant. What was news yesterday might still be news today with some tiny change in the angle. News is repetitive and monopolized by single &#34;hot&#34; issue. If you watch news once a week, you will rarely miss anything important for your long-term perspective</li><li> knowledge that comes with the news is trivial. Breaking news might be devoted entirely to a plane crash, or a bomb explosion. Unless you or your close ones are directly affected, you hardly ever become a better person by being intimate with the details of the tragedy. Understanding plane crashes or bomb explosions in general is far more relevant. A National Geographic documentary might be a better source of such knowledge. Unless this is your first ever encounter with crashes and bombs, you rarely learn anything of major significance. Your ability to change the world will better be enhanced with other sources of knowledge. Your optimization in this area will also help build a future with fewer bombs and fewer crashes.</li></ul><p>News may have more value for you at younger ages when you still need to learn a lot about the world, or when you are trying to learn a new language and want to understand the news broadcast from another country. In such cases, use news mostly as the source of indications of what supplementary material should enter your learning process for you to comprehend the news better.</p><p>Unless you study journalism (and need to understand the process), or political sciences (incl. the impact of news on the public), or you just live and die by being up-to-date, you should limit your craving for news and focus on knowledge with long-term applicability.</p><h3> <span id="Example:_how_breaking_news_breaks_the_news"> Example: how breaking news breaks the news </span></h3><p>Consider this funny episode from CNN that illustrates the obsession with &#34;breaking news&#34;. On a sunny Sunday of September 22, 2013, Fareed Zakaria spoke about Angela&#39;s Merkel impact on Germany, and Europe:</p><blockquote><em>Merkel has taken important steps to help Europe&#39;s struggling economies, spending tens of billions of dollars directly and indirectly on them. On the other hand, Merkel has imposed austerity on much of Europe, which has been excessive and counterproductive. Her argument is that it is the only way to get governments like Greece and Italy to become more competitive. Now here&#39;s the irony...</em></blockquote><p>Now here is a real irony. The intelligent commentary was interrupted by the breaking news related to Angela Merkel herself. The viewer did not get a chance to learn about the historic role of the German leader. Instead he or she got a 2 min. &#34;deal&#34; to watch Angela Merkel vote in a federal election. Three full minutes of relaxing silence and a chance to admire Angela&#39;s dress and body language in this historic moment.</p><p>Ah yes, if you cannot stand similar interruptions and want to learn about the historic role of Angela, see Zakaria&#39;s transcripts at <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1309/22/fzgps.01.html" rel="nofollow">FAREED ZAKARIA GPS: Not the Time for Big Sticks; Interview with Bill Clinton; Will Germany&#39;s Merkel Practice What She Preaches?</a></p><h2> <span id="Minimum_information_principle"> Minimum information principle </span></h2><p>Minimum information principle says that your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> should be as simple as possible and always ask a single simple question. Conglomerating information in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> results in slower learning. For example, you may be tempted to formulate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> like this:</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: What was decided at the Council of Trent, beginning in 1545, and how long did the Council go on?</blockquote><p>Two separate memories should be separated in SuperMemo due to the fact that they nearly always will require different timing of repetitions. If you can always activate the same mental pathway in thinking about the Council of Trent (&#34;neurons firing together&#34; in the same pattern), your particular <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> has a good chance of surviving long in the process without a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Lapse">memory lapse</a>. However, once you build a large database of similar <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>, and you review your sizeable material under the pressure of time, your review will always tend to strip redundant pieces of information. Overtime, your nice <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> will be reduced to the bare bones of information that will often fail its primary test: applicability in real life. It may happen, that despite zero <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Lapse">memory lapses</a>, in 2-3 years, someone will ask you about a Council of Trent in a new context and you will be amazed that you won&#39;t be able to reasonably answer the question despite having all the necessary pieces of information included in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a>. Two memories of different difficulty might be compared to two different planes of different flying characteristics. The difficult piece (e.g. 18 year duration of the Council) might be compared to a slow flying plane. The easy piece (here the reference to the Catholic Church) might be compared to a modern jet. Review of the conglomerated <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> might be compared to flying both planes at the same speed. In an extreme case, this might be impossible. The compromise speed might be too high for a slow plane, which might disintegrate beyond a certain speed limit, while the faster plane cannot slow down enough without stalling. In our memory, forgetting is equivalent to forgetting, while stalling is caused by the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a>. By doing complex and repeatable reasoning at each repetition, you might act as if handling both planes using remote control. However, this is always difficult and requires lots of focus and deliberation at repetitions. Your brain has natural defenses against such &#34;enforced repetitive reasoning&#34;. It is designed to be &#34;intellectually lazy&#34; and thus energetically efficient. Practice shows that <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> produces many more <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>. However, those <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> are usually much easier to remember. In the end, you spend less time on reviewing 5-10 <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> than you would spend on an item that would conglomerate information and suffer repeated <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Lapse">memory lapses</a> or very short <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a>.</p><p>In the course of the evolution, the brain developed strategies for abstracting away from the details and retaining only the most essential, useful and frequently used information. Those strategies are great forsurvival, but aren&#39;t as good in reaching our educational goals. Council of Trent is a typical example of knowledge we wish to have, but that is pretty expensive. This is because, for most people, it does not get reinforced in run-of-the-mill conversations, TV shows, daily applicability, or at water cooler at work. The situation might differ if you, in particular, read a lot on the subject matter. This might help the memory establish itself in an efficient manner. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> makes it possible to root such difficult-to-retain knowledge firmly in the context, and still make sure that individual repetitions focus on a very specific and cheap-to-retain memories.</p><p>This is how the same paragraph might be processed with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, and paradoxically cause a significant saving in time in the long run:</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: The Council of <span>[...]</span>, which began in 1545 and lasted for 18 years, made decisions about the basic beliefs of the Catholic Church</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: The Council of Trent, which began in <span>[...](year)</span> and lasted for 18 years, made decisions about the basic beliefs of the Catholic Church</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: The Council of Trent, which began in 1545 and lasted for <span>[...]</span> years, made decisions about the basic beliefs of the Catholic Church</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: The Council of Trent, which began in 1545 and lasted for 18 years, made decisions about the basic beliefs of <span>[...]</span></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: The Council of Trent, which began in 1545 and lasted for 18 years, made decisions about <span>[...]</span></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: <span>[...]</span>, which began in 1545 and lasted for 18 years, made decisions about the basic beliefs of the Catholic Church</blockquote><p>In the end, if you are sure this <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> works for you, check its performance in the course of the next few years.

Foods rich in antioxidants -- such as blueberries, strawberries, spinach and broccoli -- have what doctors call high ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity) levels. Middle-aged rats who were fed a high ORAC diet in the USDA-sponsored study experienced less memory loss than those given a normal diet. Some of the older, slower rats became as lively as their younger peers after taking antioxidants. &#34;We prevented both some brain and some behavioral changes that one normally sees in these rats when they hit 15 months of age,&#34; said USDA researcher Jim Joseph. Antioxidants are effective in destroying free radicals -- cell-damaging compounds that can help cause cancer and heart disease and speed the aging process. &#34;It&#39;s pretty well accepted that aging is due to the production of free radicals. So anything we can do nutritionally to provide additional antioxidants is likely to protect us in the process of aging,&#34; Joseph said. That fact already has prompted many to eat a diet rich in antioxidants. &#34;I look at it as sort of a savings account. I&#39;m benefiting today from eating right, but I&#39;m also going to have it in the future,&#34; said 30-year-old Cori Alcock. &#34;As I age and grow older, I&#39;ll have good health as well.&#34;<hr/><p><span>#Title: Antioxidants may slow aging process</span></p></blockquote><h3> <span id="Extracting_the_essence_from_the_article"> Extracting the essence from the article </span></h3><p>In the course of reading, you should select the most important sections of the article.

For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> is an excellent source. As it is edited by many people in an incremental manner, it is highly context-independent. In comparison, <a href="http://britannica.com" rel="nofollow">Britannica</a> is wordy, full of pronouns, definite clauses, and various context references.</p><p>Where <a href="http://britannica.com" rel="nofollow">Britannica</a> might say (fictitious example): &#34;<em>Over the next five years, he struggled to obtain a patent for his invention</em>&#34;, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> might say explicitly &#34;<em>In the years 1883-1889, Edison struggled to obtain a patent for a filament of carbon of high resistance</em>&#34;. This context-independent style can save you hours of parsing and re-editing.</p><p>In the presented example, the first sentence is causing trouble because the author tried to tell you far more than you might wish to process in one go.</p><p>One strategy is to start with monster <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a>, and simplify them incrementally while learning. However, you could save lots of time with another strategy, in which you split the sentences into more manageable portions. Unfortunately, in this case, some editing will be necessary in the beginning. You will also need to carefully parse the meaning of the passage. You could, for example, separate <em>who</em> and <em>what</em> components of the sentence</p><blockquote><p><strong>who</strong>: In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent smaller than bacteria.</p><p><strong>what</strong>: In 1892, Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco infected with mosaic disease even after being passed through a porcelain filter known to retain all bacteria, contained an agent that could infect other tobacco plants.</p></blockquote><p>From those two mini-<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a>, you can generate several <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> that will cover the essence of the passage:</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In <span>[...](year)</span> the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent smaller than bacteria</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892 the <span>[...](nationality)</span> botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent smaller than bacteria</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892 the Russian <span>[...](specialty)</span> Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent smaller thanbacteria</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892 the Russian botanist <span>[...](name)</span> showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent smaller than bacteria</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that <span>[...](what?)</span> from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent smaller than bacteria</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from <span>[...](type)</span> plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent smaller than bacteria</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with <span>[...](disease)</span> contained an infectious agent smaller than bacteria</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained <span>[...]</span> smaller than bacteria</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent smaller than <span>[...]</span></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892 the Russian botanist Dimitri Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco plants infected with mosaic disease contained an infectious agent <span>[...]</span> than bacteria</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892, Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco infected with mosaic disease even after being passed through a <span>[...](type)</span> filter, contained an agent that could infect other tobacco plants</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892, Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco infected with mosaic disease even after being passed through a porcelain filter known to <span>[...](property)</span>, contained an agent that could infect other tobacco plants</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: In 1892, Iwanowski showed that the sap from tobacco infected with mosaic disease even after being passed through a porcelain filter, contained an agent that <span>[...](property)</span></blockquote><p>The above questions are only a rough beginning. Only during learning will you be able to identify holes in these <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a>. You will see where they cause trouble, why they may be hard to remember or what questions are imprecise or confusing. You will fix those deficiencies incrementally while learning.</p><h2> <span id="Example:_Conglomerating_information"> Example: Conglomerating information </span></h2><p>A frequent sin committed by new users of SuperMemo is to create &#34;monster items&#34; that include many bits of information.

Here are exemplary steps that show a complete evolution of a single article into a finished <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> based on <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Active_recall">active recall</a>:</p><ol><li>Imagine that you find an article on the net, e.g. <em>The criticism of global capitalism</em>, and you decide to read it and remember it for ever</li><li>You import the article to SuperMemo</li><li>You read the article (e.g. once its turn comes up in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>)</li><li>While reading, you extract most important paragraphs. One of these, let us say, refers to <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznets_curve" rel="nofollow">Kuznets hypothesis</a></em></li><li>The extracted paragraphs will live separate lives in SuperMemo and will be scheduled for separate review, i.e. independent of the review of the parent article. The extracted paragraphs in the parent article will be marked as . Once all paragraphs in the parent article are processed, you will terminate the review of the parent article and keep on reviewing only its components (e.g. selected paragraphs)</li><li>Upon the first review, usually after a few days, you read the extracted paragraph again and analyze it as to how it should be processed further. You may decide to <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/postpone.htm">postpone</a> it, remove it from the learning process, shorten it or extract the most important sentences that you want to remember</li><li>If you decide to extract a single statement in reference to <em>Kuznets hypothesis</em> it will again be marked as  in the original <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extract</a> and will assume a separate review cycle in SuperMemo</li><li>Upon the first review of the extracted sentence, you make further decisions as to its further life in SuperMemo. Let us say, this is the wording of the Kuznets sentence:<blockquote>Acc to Kuznets hypothesis, growth (from the low income levels associated with predominantly agrarian societies) would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</blockquote></li><li>In order to capture the essence, you would probably decide to shorten the above sentence to the following form:<blockquote>Acc to Kuznets hypothesis, growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</blockquote></li><li>At the same time, other parts of the same parent article might establish a memory trace that would say that <em>Kuznets hypothesis</em> has been based on relatively weak empirical data. Moreover, recent research clearly indicates that the hypothesis is false (growth actually seems to equally benefit both the poor and the rich). You could then enhance the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extract</a> with words <em>controversial</em> or even <em>recently falsified</em>. For example:<blockquote>Recently falsified Kuznets hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</blockquote></li><li>Upon the next review of the same sentence, you may decide to convert it into a number of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>. This conversion will be incremental, i.e. you may decide to first create a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> asking about the name of the controversial hypothesis and only later ask about its actual meaning (the meaning is relatively easier to remember and shall survive longer in your memory without <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Active_recall">active recall</a>). Your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> could then look like this:<blockquote><strong>Question:</strong> Recently falsified <span>[...](name)</span> hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</blockquote><p>This <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> would again assume a separate life from the original sentence in which the keyword <em>Kuznets</em> will again be marked as <span>processed</span>. This is the original Kuznets sentence with one keyword marked as processed:</p><blockquote>Recently falsified <span>Kuznets</span> hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase, and then to a decrease in income inequality</blockquote></li><li>The same sentence will generate a few separate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> that will be processed independently. Upon the first review of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> created in the previous point, you may decide to simplify it in accordance with the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/20rules.htm">rules of formulating knowledge in learning</a>:<blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: Recently falsified <span>[...](name)</span> hypothesis claimed that growth would first lead to an increase in income inequality</blockquote></li><li>Upon the next review, you can, but you do not have to, convert the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletion</a> into a standard question-answer <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a>:<blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: What is the name of the hypothesis that falsely claims that income inequality initially increases with growth?</blockquote></li><li>The above question-answer pair is probably as simple as it can only be. Certainly, it is simple enough to be relatively easy to remember. This <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> will be repeated in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> determined by SuperMemo. You can decide how well you want to remember it. By default, it will be remembered with 95% probability of recall and require 5-15 repetitions in lifetime. The establishment of durable memory traces in your memory, completes the life cycle of this particular piece of knowledge. The only thing that remains is the memory-sustaining review in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> ranging from months to years (as determined by SuperMemo)</li><li>Once you convert all important keywords from the <em>Kuznets hypothesis</em> into separate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>, you will remove the parenting paragraph from the review process. You will no longer <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Passive_review">passively review</a> the original declarative hypothesis. You will continue repeating individual <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> and that will ensure your perfect recall of the hypothesis for as long as you deem necessary</li></ol><h2> <span id="Example:_Building_comprehension_incrementally"> Example: Building comprehension incrementally </span></h2><p>It is not unusual to generate a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a> that will keep causing problems. It is not the subject in question, but the complexity of the sentence that seems to send the brain into a panic mode. You may keep re-reading bad <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> and get the impression that at each re-reading the understanding decreases (instead of growing).</p><p>Here is an example of a bad <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a> taken from a real learning process. It caused 5 <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Lapse">lapses</a> in succession, and needed special treatment to make it palatable and useful.</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: Companies or other groups are issued emission permits and are required to hold an equivalent number of <span>[...]</span> (or <em>credits</em>) which represent the right to emit a specificamount</blockquote><p>With some experience, you will quickly notice that the problem resides in the poor quality of the chosen text. Your first red flag should come with &#34;<em>companies or other groups</em>&#34;. Unless you are an insider to the subject, you will instantly wonder what &#34;<em>other groups</em>&#34; means. If you look at the essence of your question, you will notice that &#34;<em>other groups</em>&#34; does not add to the core of the question and can easily be skipped. After some analysis, you can make an effort to formulate a straightforward question, however, it is easier and more cost-effective to take an incremental approach (as long as you keep understanding the question, which may not be the case with you).</p><p>As soon as you notice that &#34;<em>other groups</em>&#34; are out of place, you can simplify the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a>:</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: Companies are issued emission permits and are required to hold an equivalent number of <span>[...]</span> (or <em>credits</em>) which represent the right to emit a specific amount</blockquote><p>You may also notice that <em>allowances</em> and <em>credits</em> are synonymous (acc. to that particular question), and you may not need to tax your memory with both terms. You can therefore make the question easier:</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: Companies are issued emission permits and are required to hold an equivalent number of <span>[...]</span> which represent the right to emit a specific amount</blockquote><p>During the next repetition you may wish to simplify the question further. You can now start feeling confident that the question will stick to your memory. If that makes you feel better, you will have made a big step towards better recall:&lt;/p&gt;</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: Companies hold a number of <span>[...]</span> which represent the right to emit a specific amount</blockquote><p>Some time in the future, you might take yet another incremental step:</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: <span>[...]</span> represent the right to emit a specific amount (by companies)</blockquote><p>Finally, you may realize that you question is actually a definition of a term (<em>credit/allowance</em>). As such, it does not even need the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze</a>. You may also notice that the definition misses an important context point. The original question spoke of carbon emissions (which is probably indicated by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> references that provide the context of the question).</p><blockquote><strong>Question</strong>: (What is the name of) the right to emit a specific amount of CO<sub>2</sub> (by companies)?</blockquote><p>With the above definition, learning should finally be easy and fun. Remember that it is a frequently used standard to separate synonyms or equivalent answers with a slash (&#34;/&#34;). This means that any answer will do <em>permits</em>, <em>allowances</em>, or <em>credits</em>. You do not need to list them all and you do not need to remember about semi-obvious <em>carbon</em> prefix.</p><p>Interestingly, it can easily be found that the text comes from May 7, 2010 version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>. It was red-flagged with &#34;clarification needed&#34;, which instantly tells you that you are not the only one who got an issue with the paragraph. In such cases blame the author and search for better texts. In this particular example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> text was improved just 2 weeks later, and the current version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> holds a better version (Aug 2013).</p><h2> <span id="Example:_Unsuitable_texts"> Example: Unsuitable texts </span></h2><p>Not all texts are suitable or easy to process with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. You will not want to process a literary novel with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. You may still prefer to read it on paper in a bathtub. Examples of texts that are difficult to process are: flowery materials, materials rich in explanations and metaphors, programming code, case studies, mathematical derivations, experimental research documentation, etc. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> is easiest for encyclopedic materials. Materials that are not suitable will often include a valuable message; however, you will often be better off by phrasing it on your own and processing your summary with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. For example, you would not want to memorize the Linux source code. However, you could find some specific facts or regularities in the code, describe them shortly and then learn the description incrementally (perhaps with snippet code illustrations).</p><h3> <span id="Example_1:_Texts_that_are_too_general"> Example 1: Texts that are too general </span></h3><p>Here is an example paragraph that caused learning problem to a user of SuperMemo:</p><blockquote><em>A good enterprise architect should enable the right balance between the needs of the organization for an integrated IT strategy, permitting the closest possible synergy across the extended enterprise, and allowing individual business units to innovate safely in their pursuit of competitive advantage.</em></blockquote><p>The user wrote:</p><blockquote><em>I have no problem understanding this phrase (synergy across business units must be balanced against freedom to innovate within business units), and I constructed two <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> from it for either side of the balance, and when presented with either question I can fill in the blanks. Yet, I was in a discussion recently defending a synergy position, not realizing that it might jeopardize innovation, not even realizing I had this SuperMemo question pointing it out to me. In other words, even though I can answer the question in SuperMemo, it is not something that stuck in my memory, i.e. the synergy is not associated with freedom-to-innovate and vice versa (maybe it will after this mail). So, I suspect that I am only able to answer the question based on recognition of the question or some such, and not on recognition of the association. I figure that a better way to associate the two would be to ask something like &#34;what must be balanced against each other&#34; but this question would be so general in nature that it would create serious interference with other questions that deal with other aspects of enterprise architecture that need to be balanced against each other. Or I would have to make it more specific, again risking to give away the answer in the question, which would also not cause the association to form.</em></blockquote><p>Can you identify a problem here?</p><p>In similar cases, you need to pause to ponder what kind of questions you want to be able to answer having read the passage. If the questions are too general or too obvious, you just need to trust your own intelligence and creativity to be able to answer them on the basis of your experience and more specific questions in the given area of knowledge.</p><p>In this case, keywords such as &#34;synergy&#34; or &#34;innovate&#34; might provide a hazy way to capture the meaning of the passage. However, very general texts are not suitable for treatment with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>. You may waste unnecessary time on re-reading the entire passage at question time, or waste time on simplifying the passage to capture the essence. In school jargon, you might call similar passages &#34;waffle&#34;. They may carry an important message, they may help the flow of text, they might be explanatory, but they do not yield material suitable for memorization. In the extreme case you can juxtapose Wikipedia-like &#34;IT = Information Technology&#34; with obvious &#34;waffle&#34; that cannot be clozed: <em>We should be nice for other people</em>.</p><p>In all sorts of exams, you will always need to tackle lots of &#34;waffle&#34;. You will also meet teachers who demand fluent &#34;waffle&#34; performance. However, this is not the type of knowledge that will make you a better expert or a better person. If you meet &#34;waffle&#34;, pause to think if there are questions that truly flow from the text, or if the text is too general to be handled with SuperMemo. In your case, you might do better by perhaps adding some meatier passages on enterprise synergy or constraints on innovation or... Actually, you are the best person to find supplementary material that will help you better understand the underlying issues.</p><p>If waffle bothers you, try to find a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> equivalent. Due to the nature of crowdsourcing, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> lends itself perfectly to incremental processing. Once you get the hang and feel the benefit, you will quickly learn to spot text and passages that are less suitable and provide less benefit when processed with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>.</p><h3> <span id="Example_2:_Unsuitable_text_from_super-memory.com"> Example 2: Unsuitable text from super-memory.com </span></h3><p>Here is another example that comes from <a href="http://super-memory.com" rel="nofollow">super-memory.com</a>.

When you see a smart student quickly learn new things, think logically, solve puzzles and show uncanny wit, you may say: This guy is really intelligent! See how fast his brain reacts! The student has a fast processor installed and his RAM has a lightning access time. He may though still need a couple of years to &#34;build&#34; good software through years of study. IQ tests attempt to measure this sort of intelligence in abstraction of knowledge.

It reiterates the same message a few times using different words in an attempt to find a metaphor that will strike a cord with the reader. Consequently, it is enough you extract only the core message. For example:</p><blockquote><em>Intelligence as <span>processing power</span>: <span>IQ</span> tests attempt to measure this sort of intelligence in abstraction of <span>knowledge</span></em></blockquote><p>You could also add:</p><blockquote><em>Intelligence as <span>processing power</span>: The difficulty of improving processing power by training is similar to the fact that <span>programming</span> cannot speed up <span>the processor</span></em></blockquote><p>Once you learn the above 6 <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> (marked by 6 clozed keywords), you will most likely be able to recall that it should be very difficult to train for an improved score in an ideally designed IQ test.</p><p>Incremental learning has its followers and its hardline critics.

Nearly all criticism comes from those who never used <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> themselves.

It is hard to make a prediction on the basis of your text. The fact that you studied <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is a very good predictor of success. On the other hand, the fact that the mere concept of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a> can generate stress, tells you a lot about your personality. You might just be one of those who excel at theory and fail in practical situations for a number of reasons. You should definitely give incremental learning a try and see how it works. If frustrations keep multiplying beyond the first two months of use, your chances may drop. It is vital to start from simplest concepts: import, extract and cloze. All the remaining tools should wait for their turn until you start enjoying the process. For the same reason, you should start from learning about things you love (not about algebra or economics). Your hobby, your pet, your favorite sport, health, your favorite music band, your favorite actor or actress, etc. Use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> as its texts are well-suited for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. Only after 2-3 months, when you start sensing the new quality of knowledge emerge in your mind, will you be able to anchor emotionally in the process and find sufficient motivation to overcome successive obstacles.</p><p>Short comments on the rest of your text:</p><ul><li> <strong>tunnel vision</strong>: experience shows that incremental learning favors broad learning as opposed to developing a tunnel vision. After all, the more you know, the more you know you do not know. You are more likely to have your day monopolized by a single topic when you do traditional reading or browsing. In incremental learning you face the whole spectrum of your knowledge (with a natural bias towards your interests). Unpredictability of incremental learning sequences, also in different moods or different contexts (e.g. change of interest), increases the quality of the creative processes. This is where curiosity is born. You are more likely to become interested with a seemingly irrelevant detail when you have a peaceful time allocation typical of incremental learning. This is how you keep branching to new areas. This branching is less likely when you work in conditions of stress, time constraints, and information overload, typical to free browsing on the net. In free browsing, you can open 20 browser tabs and struggle with the right course of action: read now, make favorite, save to disk, skim, give up, etc. In incremental learning, you just import all tabs, and return to your main line of thought. Naturally, it helps greatly if you prioritize the tabs. This is a way of consolidating new interests as opposed to giving them just a temporary brush. SuperMemo&#39;s capacity to prevent tunnel vision is mentioned amongst its advantages. See: <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/read.htm#Advantages_of_incremental_reading">Advantages of incremental learning</a>: Uniform progress</strong></li><li> <strong>wild goose chase</strong>: the way shifting <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priorities</a> work in SuperMemo is exactly how priorities behave in real life situations: your yesterday&#39;s interests are ruthlessly replaced by today&#39;s interests, and so on. This is a wild goose chase indeed. But the fault is not with SuperMemo, but with human nature. Please recall that <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> started from <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Reading_list">reading lists</a>. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_bias">Priority bias</a> could result in having a thousand or ten thousand top priority articles. This situation was not manageable and not rational. With relative <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priorities</a> you can observe the process, and work to improve your strategies, and your personal honesty about priorities. This will not stop the wild goose chase, but you have a range of tools to correct your mistakes (e.g. when discovering a neglected portion of the material). However long you think about it, you are not likely to find a better remedy to your knowledge greed than a simple <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a>! You have signaled the problem, but you neglect the fact that in real life, the problem is incomparably greater. In SuperMemo, if you discover neglected material, you can up-prioritize it. In traditional learning, you forget the material and the problem itself. It is better to chase the goose that to have it swept under the carpet. </li><li> <strong>stress</strong>: if the prioritization process is stressful, you can initially ignore the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a>. You will needed it only when your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> grows beyond a manageable size. You can then gradually introduce various prioritization levels. For example, you can have a shy start with just two levels: <em><strong>Important: 22%</strong></em> and <em><strong>Unimportant: 88%</strong></em>. You will soon discover that you need more precision, esp. that you will never escape the feeling &#34;<em>this article must land in top 3 articles</em>&#34;, which at some point may mean you need decimal places or referencing the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a> by position.</li><li> <strong>user friendliness</strong>: the problem of <strong>Step</strong> in <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/subsetop.htm#spread_priorities">Spread priorities</a></strong> is typical of SuperMemo, which claims to be unfriendly for novices to better satisfy the pros. This option might display a message: &#34;<em>You are trying to squeeze more <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> into the range than the size of the range</em>&#34;. However, this would make pros apoplectic, as it is very easy to input wrong data. You do not want to waste time on clicking away the message. A pro will just want to correct the input. This problem cannot be remedied by <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/file.htm">File</a> : <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/file.htm#Level">Level</a></strong> because <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/subsetop.htm#spread_priorities">Spread priorities</a></strong> is available only at advanced levels. This means that the user should already be inured to the fact that the first use of any function in SuperMemo may be difficult. A more sophisticated solution, e.g. a wizard or messages incorporated in the dialog, would probably not pass <code>Value/Time</code> criterion on the ever-bloating SuperMemo tasklist. You are right, SuperMemo is not nice for novices. If you have simpler solution ideas, please mail them. They are always read carefully.</li><li> <strong>programming</strong>: it is not true that <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is unsuitable for programmers (for example see: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/programming.htm">SuperMemo as a new tool for programmers</a>). This misunderstanding might come from statements such as &#34;<em>computer code is not suitable as text to be processed with incremental reading</em>&#34;, even though it is conceivable that <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> might be useful in code analysis (e.g. when a large number of well-encapsulated short procedures of different priority needs to be reviewed).</li></ul><h2> <span id="Priority_queue:_Introduction"> Priority queue: Introduction </span></h2><p>Human knowledge resources are vast. Our appetite to acquire knowledge is usually exceeding our learning capacity. Incremental learning makes it easy to import huge volumes of knowledge. However, if you cannot effectively process all that imported knowledge, you risk neglecting high priority material by being overwhelmed by subjects that might be relegated to later study. This state of affair was the main reason for introducing <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priorities</a> in SuperMemo.</p><p>In incremental learning, all <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> are organized into a sequence determined by their <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>. That sequence is called the <strong>priority queue</strong>. The <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> is determined by the importance of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> for a particular student. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">Elements</a> with lower <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priorities</a> will be sacrificed first when the student runs out of learning time on a given day. As a result, only high-<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> will receive the desired level of recall/<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a>.

With the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a>, you know you did your best and only lower priority material was left behind.

This attitude is caused by two factors:</p><ul><li> smaller volume of learning early in the process</li><li> false conviction that human memory is vast enough to hold all that dream knowledge</li></ul><p>Do you think you are able to memorize the entire <a href="http://britannica.com" rel="nofollow">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> line by line, fact for fact?</p><p>Chances are your answer might be: &#34;<em>I might be too lazy, I might be too busy, but if I had all the time of my day for the job, I would</em>&#34;. Or perhaps &#34;<em>I might not, but I have heard of geniuses able to do it! How about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Peek" rel="nofollow">Kim Peek</a>?</em>&#34;. If you believe the encyclopedia is within the realm of possible, you will soon realize that you desperately need the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a> to help you overcome a big surprise: our memory is far more limited than you think!</p><p>Assuming we do not deal with humans affected with a mutation to their memory system, memorizing <a href="http://britannica.com" rel="nofollow">Britannica</a> would falsify the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/theory.htm">theory of SuperMemo</a> which should apply to all healthy adults. In the light of SuperMemo, memorizing <a href="http://britannica.com" rel="nofollow">Britannica</a> verges on impossible. There are 44 million words in Britannica&#39;s 32 volumes. This translates to 6 million SuperMemo <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> (&#34;human memory bits&#34;) assuming the average keyword extraction on information dense texts as 1:7. Assuming a 50-year learning span, we get to 18,250 days and 330 <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> per day. Assuming optimum representation of knowledge (say <a href="http://britannica.com" rel="nofollow">Britannica</a> is already &#34;perfectly formulated&#34;) you cannot learn faster for a given level of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">knowledge retention</a> than with SuperMemo (it simply finds the mathematical optimum), and practice shows it is very difficult to sustain more than 100 <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> per day in the long run with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> around 95%. In other words, for an intelligent man, for perfectly formulated Britannica knowledge, with SuperMemo, you are hardly able to accomplish the goal with your whole life devoted to the task!</p><h2> <span id="Volume_vs._retention_battle_in_learning"> Volume vs. retention battle in learning </span></h2><p><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> makes it easy to import large volumes of learning material from the Internet. By default, all imported material enters the learning process. As a result, large volumes of unprocessed information begin to compete for your attention with most important pieces of knowledge that you decided to remember. It is a clash of priorities. On one hand you want to ensure high <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> of your mission-critical knowledge (as in classical SuperMemo), on the other, you want to devour more and more new knowledge.</p><p>Before SuperMemo, your learning would largely be based on reading and reviewing books or your own notes. With older SuperMemos, you would divide your time between reading (on paper) and repetitions (on the computer). With <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, those competing processes were blended into one. You can read and review concurrently in SuperMemo. However, for the most avid incremental readers, the balance of priority will always dangerously shift in favor of new reading at the cost of the previously acquired knowledge. This comes from human nature. New reading provides instant gratification: <em>&#34;Today, I have learned something new. I am wiser now&#34;</em>. Reviewing the material you already know will always feel like a burden. We are always unhappy with our forgetful memory. It always feels that the nature should have given us a natural choice of what to forget and what to remember without the painful effort of reviewing what we already know.</p><p>To settle the Volume-vs-Retention battle and to resolve the perpetual clash of priorities, you need better weapons than those made available by older SuperMemos. Before the arrival of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a> (2006), you would need to use a complex set of tools to employ massive learning and still protect the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> of your most important knowledge. You would use complex concepts such as <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#A-Factor">A-Factors</a>, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Forgetting_index">forgetting index</a>, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/review.htm">subset learning</a>, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/postpone.htm">selective postpones</a>, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/browsermenu.htm">repetition sorting</a>, etc. These tools were poorly automated and required substantial effort and knowledge on your part. In practice, most incremental readers would have to opt for the simplest prioritization tool: <em>moderation</em>. You could best protect your previous investment in learning by limiting your hunger for knowledge.</p><p>Newer SuperMemos use a simple and fully automated mechanism that will help you combine high volumes of reading with high <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> of the most important material. This mechanism is based on the concept of the <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a></strong>.</p><h2> <span id="Priority_bias_in_incremental_reading"> Priority bias in incremental reading </span></h2><p>In SuperMemo, each <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> receives a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> from <code>0%</code> to <code>100%</code>. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">Elements</a> sorted by their <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> form the <em><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a></em>. An <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a>&#39;s <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> can also be expressed as its position in the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a>. The most important <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> will sit at <code>Position=1</code> of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a>. The queue is a relative queue. This means that if you, for example, insert an important article at <code>Position=3</code>, all <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> and articles at higher positions will be shifted by one position up in the queue (i.e. towards lower <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>). Thus the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> at <code>Position=999</code> will be pushed to <code>Position=1000</code>, while the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> previously sitting at <code>Position=3</code> will now occupy <code>Position=4</code>. The first two <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> in the queue, i.e. <code>Position=1</code> and <code>Position=2</code>, will not move. The relative nature of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a> will help you instantly inspect the current <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> of each <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a>. In earlier versions of SuperMemo, you could observe crowding of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> at high-priority ranks. For example, you could amass a large number of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a> with <code><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#A-Factor">A-Factor</a>=1.01</code> and be practically unable to prioritize within that group. (<code><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#A-Factor">A-Factor</a>=1.01</code> is the lowest possible and would correspond to the highest <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>).</p><p>The fundamental rationale for using a relative <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a> is the existence of a form of cognitive bias, which we will call the <em>priority bias</em>. This bias makes us always think that the newly found article is extremely important to read. The new article feels so important, because we underestimate the value of all the previously imported articles. Our memory is unable to produce an effective estimate of the importance of the current mass of remembered knowledge. Even less so is it capable of producing a remotely accurate estimate of the importance of the mass of knowledge stored in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> process (of which, usually, only a tiny fraction is part of your long-term memories). The net effect is that we always underestimate the volume of what we know, the volume of what we keep in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, and the importance distribution of those volumes of knowledge. This psychological mechanism is also the primary force that works against the universal adoption of SuperMemo. Humans are, by biological design, very weak at estimating the size of their knowledge, the cost of learning, and the power of forgetting. As a result, without an intimate knowledge of what SuperMemo is, individuals rarely ever pause to sense the need to use <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>. This underestimation effect is by far more damaging in the case of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_learning">incremental learning</a>, which is far more complex and has still not been explained in sufficiently simple and catchy terms.</p><p>By employing the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a>, SuperMemo will help you visualize the <em>priority bias</em> and the process in which large volumes of new material quickly displace the old material from your learning focus. Moreover, SuperMemo highly automates the process in which you can handle material overflow and reconcile high <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> with high volumes of learning. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> has always boasted of its capacity to bring the volume of learning to unprecedented levels.

Of good things, there is a correlation between the hunger for knowledge and creativity. If you struggle with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priorities</a> and overflow then it might be a good indicator, as long as you win the battle and learn to prioritize honestly.</p><p>To prioritize well, you only need to know that the most important material has <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> <code>0%</code>, while your least important material is <code>100%</code>. You need to develop a sense for where, in the queue, a piece of information belongs. If you think that everything is &#34;top priority&#34; then you are clearly at the beginning of the road. Pick two <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> and ask yourself a question: <em>&#34;If I was to forget/delete one, which one would that be?&#34;</em> This exercise will help you see different applications of different <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> and different value behind the applications. Another exercise is: try to give <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> as low <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> as you can stomach. Can you make it <em>10%</em>? Would you be hurt if it was <em>20%</em>? Would the world collapse if it was <em>66%</em>? With some conscious effort you will realize that you can live without some portions of your knowledge (after all, most people do not use SuperMemo at all and survive ok). Over months of training, you will get better at this.</p><p>If you keep peeking at the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/statistics.htm#Protection"><strong>Protection</strong> statistic</a>, you may also realize that sending <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> beyond your average priority protection will help you clear them from view for a while. This way, if you have created too many <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a> that crowd your process, you might actually enjoy sending most of them out of the protected zone, and focus on just one or two that capture the essence of knowledge you are trying to learn.</p><p>SuperMemo will not help you much in the prioritization work unless you manually play with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> (e.g. by saying &#34;<em>this cannot wait 30 days, I must see it in 11</em>&#34;).

It is therefore vital that you begin your review process from <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> of the highest priority. Low-priority <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> might linger in the queue for months or years. High-priority <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> should be reviewed at the exact time that SuperMemo finds optimum. Only this way will you be able to meet your <em><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/fi.htm#requested_forgetting_index">requested forgetting index</a></em> criteria for high-priority material while still being under no pressure to limit your hunger for knowledge. In simpler terms, in an overloaded learning process, the SuperMemo promise of &#34;excellent memory&#34; will only apply to your top-priority material.

That would be a throwback to your pre-SuperMemo times when you kept reading new material, while forgetting your previous investment in learning.

You need to adjust the proportion of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a> and the degree of randomization by trial and error. This will all depend on your goals and preferences. If you admit too few <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a> in the process, you will not gain much new knowledge. If you allow too many <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a>, you will start forgetting previously learned material. If you randomize the learning queue too much, the whole prioritization mechanism will unravel, and your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> of high-priority material will drop. If you sort repetitions strictly by <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>, the new material will keep displacing the old material due to the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_bias">priority bias</a>.

However, once the first repetition ends with success and your future recall at longer <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> is a bit more likely, you can provide a more honest <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>, which is usually lower than when first prioritizing <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> for the sake of generating <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a>. If you are still worried about possible forgetting, you can wait with establishing the honest <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> until the 3rd or 4th review. The longer you wait, the greater the chance you will forget something truly important in the meantime.</li></ul></li><li>If you hesitate between a lower <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> and a higher <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>, <strong>a lower priority is nearly always better!</strong> (due to the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_bias">priority bias</a> that is likely to crowd your learning process)</li><li>If you skip some of your daily repetition sessions, item protection will drop (as indicated by <strong>Priority protection</strong> in <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/analysis.htm">Analysis</a> : Use</strong>).

Incremental video makes it possible to learn from multiple sources of video without neglecting any one of them. The processing of individual sources proceeds in parallel and time allocations for individual sources depend on student&#39;s priorities. Incremental video is to video as <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> is to learning from electronic texts. In incremental video, it is the user who decides which portions of a video are important to remember. Those portions are part of a standard learning process known from other applications of SuperMemo. Each portion of the video forms a separate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a> that is reviewed at increasing <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a>. Despite working with thousands of videos, you do not ever need to feel lost, ever get bored, or ever miss a valuable scene. You can also use SuperMemo as your video or music jukebox. You can work with individual videos for mere seconds. Just as much as is needed to set the new viewing point, determine the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> and determine the date of the next viewing. This way, you can process dozens of videos daily and work with thousands of videos in parallel. You shall feel overwhelmed with the richness of <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> never again!</p><p>On the face of it, incremental video looks like channel-zapping on steroids. However, it is also a powerful learning technique that makes it easy to process thousands of videos in parallel without getting lost. It also makes it easy to learn individual video scenes for long-term <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a>. It can be used to learn sports, master musical instruments, understand biology, or learn fun dialogs in your favorite movies. Individual videos are processed in small portions. Viewing can be resumed at any time at the last viewing position. Best pieces are preserved for repeat viewing. Individual videos are prioritized and served on a daily basis in manageable portions in order of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>.</p><p>Although, incremental video can roughly be implemented with a pair of digital video recorders working in tandem, only SuperMemo provides a bona fide implementation with the whole set of incremental learning tools. SuperMemo makes it possible to learn from standard video files (e.g. MP4). It also makes it easy to learn from <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> videos. At the moment of writing these words, no other software in the world provides the incremental video learning toolset.</p><div><p><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/a/ad/Incremental_video.jpg"><img alt="SuperMemo: Incremental video in action - Incremental learning about DNA wrapping and replication based on a video imported from YouTube" src="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/thumb/a/ad/Incremental_video.jpg/800px-Incremental_video.jpg" width="800" height="518"/></a></p><blockquote><em><strong>Figure</strong>: Exemplary screenshot from an incremental video process in SuperMemo.</em></blockquote></div><h3> <span id="Incremental_video_with_YouTube"> Incremental video with YouTube </span></h3><p>Incremental video in SuperMemo can use <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> videos. You can capitalize on the video streaming power of <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> and speed up SuperMemo even though you may suffer video lags on weaker Internet connections. You will also dramatically save on hard disk space. Videos are notorious hogs of space, your <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collections</a> will take a tiny fraction of space needed for video based on local files. <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> will actually take less space than <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collections</a> while carrying lots of learning power. If your network is slow or frequently down, you should take comfort in the fact that this situation is likely to change for the better as networks improve worldwide all the time (and this progress is not likely to be slowed soon). Last but not least, SuperMemo will hopefully encourage you to upload your own educational videos to <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> and thus share them with others.</p><h3> <span id="Incremental_video_with_video_files"> Incremental video with video files </span></h3><p>Incremental video in SuperMemo can use video files from your local drive. You do not need to limit your learning to videos available from <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> that can be notoriously volatile (e.g. with accounts closed for copyright violations, embedding blocked by account holders, videos made private, etc.). You are not limited by the need to access the Internet. You can also process private videos.</p><p>Using incremental video with local files requires computers with significant processing power. On a strong PC, processing video files is fast and painless. It may be slower on weaker PCs. Your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collections</a> may grow to be terabytes large, which is the main disadvantage of keeping files local. Make sure you have a big dedicated external drive for a backup of your material. The time-scale resolution of local videos is higher than that of <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a>-based videos, which are limited to setting <strong>Start</strong> and <strong>Stop</strong> points in increments of 1 second. With local files, you can review fragments that last milliseconds. You can review your best football move at nauseam. Moreover, with local files, you can work when disconnected from the net.</p><p>Incremental video can use local files in several video formats (incl. MP4, WMV, AVI, MOV, Mpeg, and more). Not all video formats are supported. Before you commit to SuperMemo, give it a try to see if your files can be processed or converted to acceptable format with third party tools.</p><h2> <span id="Incremental_video_in_SuperMemo"> Incremental video in SuperMemo </span></h2><p>SuperMemo is a pioneer in implementing versatile incremental video. For those who are familiar with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> (also pioneered by SuperMemo), incremental video is an analogous technique. Instead of text <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a>, you generate video <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a>, i.e. portions of a larger video. Video <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> are viewed repeatedly in increasing <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> (as it is the case with other pieces of information in SuperMemo).</p><p>Individual videos and their <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> are treated in the same way as all other <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic elements</a> and enter the learning process according to the rules that are known from <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. Currently, only <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Passive_review">passive review</a> of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> is supported.

They can also have embedding disabled. This is a major problem for the present implementation of YouTube-based incremental video in SuperMemo. There are no API tools that could allow of legal localization of YouTube contents (at the moment of writing). However, the problem mostly affects copyrighted material that shows up on <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> illegally (e.g. movies, music, etc.). Occasionally, video authors themselves remove content. This should never be a problem though if you use your own videos. Hopefully, there will be more and more persistent content uploaded for educational purposes.  </li><li> <em>Alt+Left arrow</em> shortcut is used by Internet Explorer to return to the previously visited page. As a result, it also works like an Undo for your <strong>Start:Stop</strong> setting. To return to the previous page in SuperMemo, use the <strong>Back</strong> button (<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/f/f8/Back.gif" width="16" height="16"><img alt="Back enables you to go back to the most recently visited element" src="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/f/f8/Back.gif" width="16" height="16"/></a>) on the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/navigate.htm">navigation bar</a></li><li> it may happen that your network is down or the Internet is slow when working with <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> videos. You may therefore prefer to first experiment with a dedicated incremental video <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> to learn how to handle videos and prevent interruptions to learning in cases of network problems. You can always stop working with your incremental video <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a>, return to your regular learning, and resume video learning when the network returns to normal functionality</li><li> if you would like to use SuperMemo as your <a href="http://youtube.com" rel="nofollow">YouTube</a> jukebox, you should also keep music videos in a single <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> (or mark them all with a specific keyword for fast <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/review.htm">subset learning</a>). You can later hide your jukebox <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> in the system tray. Your jukebox will play only the selected fragments of individual videos in order of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> as specified in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/priority.htm#Sorting_repetitions">sorting criteria</a>.

At the very minimum, MAPI compatible mail would be needed for sending SuperMemo <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> or objects via mail.</p><p>Here are the most important ways you can use SuperMemo in mail processing, and use e-mail in communicating your SuperMemo work:</p><ol><li> <strong>Prioritizing mail</strong>: To make sure you always begin with the most important pieces, you should use the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a> to prioritize mail. Possibly, you will not manage to answer all mail, however, you will always do your best in processing top-priority messages.</li><li> <strong>Using incremental learning tools to process mail</strong>: <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> is a powerful tool that helps you prioritize, schedule, and process mail. As a result, you may decide that instead of using your mail software, it is more convenient and rational to use SuperMemo to read and respond to your e-mail. Users of Windows (Live) Mail or MS Outlook can now import all their mail to SuperMemo with a keystroke. If you receive more mail than you are able to effectively process, you can use overload tools. You will immediately process only the most important pieces and proceed with others according to their <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a> in proportion of available time. As in the learning process, rescheduling and sorting happens in the background, so that you never lose sleep over delaying a reply or being slow with processing excess mail. You can respond to longer pieces incrementally.</li><li> <strong>Sending learning data to others</strong>: If you encounter valuable information in incremental learning (or when processing mail), you can send it to your colleagues, friends, partners or family with a single click for inspiration or further discussion. For example, while reading an article about decoding human genome, you might find out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Venter" rel="nofollow">Craig Venter of Celera</a> comes from a Mormon family and that his father was eventually excommunicated. You can send such a note (or the whole article) from SuperMemo to your Mormon friend with a click of a button.</li><li> <strong>Using mail material in incremental learning</strong>: You may also incorporate snippets of mail in your learning process. You can treat most valuable pieces of e-mail as articles to read. If you receive highly inspirational messages, you may want to introduce it into incremental learning and memorize its portions to ensure long-term benefit. In other words, your mail may not only prompt action, but may also be used in learning to keep your memory up-to-date with things you care about. This way you can also learn from materials sent from others, esp. if those materials come in small portions extracted from an incremental learning process conducted by other people. You can also comment or respond to individual portions of the processed mail. You can do it while reading or when new ideas come to your mind upon review. You can use this process for the purpose of creativity (e.g. reviewing an inspiring idea or information in different contexts) or for the purpose of recall (e.g. trying to remember the university major of your cousin).</li></ol><h2> <span id="Sending_learning_data_to_others"> Sending learning data to others </span></h2><p>To send an <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> via e-mail, click the <strong>E-mail</strong> button (<a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/e/e9/Send_e-mail.png" width="16" height="16"><img alt="SuperMemo: Send a copy of the element (or its part) in an e-mail message" src="http://www.super-memory.com/help/images/e/e9/Send_e-mail.png" width="16" height="16"/></a>) on the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/navigate.htm">navigation bar</a> or press <em>Shift+Ctrl+E</em>.

You will not experience mental chaos caused by an overcrowded Inbox</li><li> <strong>prioritization</strong>: if you get more e-mail material than you are able to process, you can use incremental learning tools for prioritizing mail and its fragments. One of the greatest strengths of incremental learning is its unique system for efficiently determining the priority of the reading material with the help of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority_queue">priority queue</a>. Remember to politely inform everyone about your e-mail processing system. Otherwise you may easily be accused of acting as an <em>e-mail black hole</em></li><li> <strong>handling overflow</strong>: you can use <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/postpone.htm">Postpone</a></strong> and other rescheduling tools to resolve the excessive inflow of information without damage to your selected priority criteria. If you work in a team, it is a great idea to delegate some of your work; however, not all work can be delegated. Additionally, if you delegate, you do not learn from e-mail that you delegate. To answer the latter problem, you can choose a solution in the middle: delegate e-mail jobs and process inflowing pieces with the tools of incremental learning</li></ol><h3> <span id="Disadvantages_2"> Disadvantages </span></h3><ol><li> <strong>splintering e-mail</strong>: some people dislike <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/search?q=splinter" rel="nofollow">splintered</a> responses. They prefer to have their e-mail analyzed as a whole and responded to as a whole (preferably within an hour :). As an act of kindness, try to remember people&#39;s preferences and do not use incremental e-mail processing (too much) on those who do not like it</li><li> <strong>incremental approach is not transitive</strong>: incremental e-mail processing shows the greatest power for longer pieces of mail, article forwards, etc. For very short e-mail messages, incremental e-mail processing delivers less value per unit time. Because incremental mail processing leads to short communication bursts, it undermines its own power when used at both ends of the communication channel.

This approach eliminates the instant nature of mail, but makes the entire process more reasonable, esp. if volumes are far beyond manageable. Although many pieces of mail will get substantially delayed (or perhaps even neglected), top-priority mail will be processed in the first order, and damage done by urgency will be less.

For example: <em>[mailto:johndoe@hotmail.com]</em> (note the square brackets around the tag and the missing space between <em>mailto:</em> and the address). You can specify multiple recipients by separating their names with a semicolon. For example: <em>[mailto:miko;alex]</em> where <em>miko</em> and <em>alex</em> must be defined in your mail program&#39;s address book (e.g. Windows Live Mail address book). Adding the <em>[mailto:</em> tag is useful when you want to ask many questions or forward many pieces of a single mail to a single person whose address is complex and is not defined in your address book</li><li> Optionally, add a degree of randomization in your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/priority.htm#Sorting_repetitions">Sorting criteria</a> to prevent &#34;tunnel vision&#34; in processing.

Incremental approach is most suited for complex problems with multiple reasoning paths or requiring rich input of new information. Some bugs in SuperMemo would be particularly intractable due to their complex technical background or difficulty in reproducing the problem. In most severe cases, it makes sense to set up a separate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> for working on a single issue. That <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> can later be integrated with larger bodies of knowledge (incl. problem solving knowledge).</p><h3> <span id="How_does_incremental_problem_solving_work.3F"> How does incremental problem solving work? </span></h3><p>Incremental problem solving works as follows:</p><ul><li> collect all information about the problem from all sources available</li><li> write down your own ideas and comments as separate <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a></li><li> process all that information with incremental learning techniques</li><li> document all new ideas and new sub-problems that need to be tackled</li><li> import all relevant supplementary material that expands on core ideas</li></ul><h3> <span id="Advantages_of_incremental_problem_solving"> Advantages of incremental problem solving </span></h3><ul><li> always focusing on a small sub-problem that requires further testing or gathering further information</li><li> never missing a single idea in a jungle of criss-crossing inspiration</li><li> never drowning in excess information</li><li> using random association of ideas that boosts creativity</li><li> never getting frustrated by lack of progress in solving the problem.

By analogy to <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, this process is called <em>incremental writing</em>.</p><p>The technique of incremental writing was used to compile some of the materials at <a href="http://super-memory.com" rel="nofollow">super-memory.com</a>.

This is suitable for large fact-packed material that is difficult to organize sequentially. In addition, one&#39;s own writing may be the source of most input, as opposed to external electronic sources. Incremental writing is also suitable in a compilation of a large body of prior writing, esp. of materials that are repetitive, fact-rich, and often loosely connected. Incremental writing is less useful for texts with a linear line of thought.</p><p>Incremental article writing is an open-ended process that can be interrupted at any stage for the article to be exported to as a single document for text-flow rewrites.</p><p>Articles written using incremental writing may be particularly suitable for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>.

For the exactly same reasons, materials compiled with incremental writing are highly suitable for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>. They may be bloated and repetitive, however, with <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, they can be prioritized in a rational way. Incremental writing leaves the texts highly granular and the flow of thought is jagged, however, in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, this is an advantage as all individual articles and subarticles carry sufficient local context to be read independently.</p><h3> <span id="Incremental_writing_algorithm"> Incremental writing algorithm </span></h3><p>The incremental writing algorithm involves the steps presented below.

Those materials were supplemented with the review of knowledge of sleep from a general knowledge <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> compiled by the author. The whole process started from a massive review of the entire material with incremental learning. The construction of a rough outline of the structure of the article proceeded in parallel (in the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/contwind.htm"><strong>Contents</strong> window</a>). Supplementary materials were imported to fill in or complement individual pieces of knowledge. Figures, annotations, links, and literature citations were also processed incrementally in order of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priority</a>. This process quickly resulted in an article bloat, however, this was a bloat of valuable information rather than a bloat of excess writing. Towards the end of the process, individual <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topics</a> from SuperMemo were imported to a single-page wiki. Some manual wikification was necessary at that step.

SuperMemo makes writing fun as compared to traditional methods (e.g. writing in a word processor). If you are in no mood to write about one topic today, you might be more inclined to try something else. If you are in no mood for writing anything, tackle some minor clean up jobs. Very often, once you start writing, you get sucked into the effort and the mood returns. A piece of information can trigger new ideas. If it happens in your writing slot, you can instantly write down new ideas. You can write them rough and short. But you need to write them instantly. If you keep waiting, the memory of the inspiration whittles down to just the need to write about a subject! This is how forgetting affects your own ideas! Strike the iron while it&#39;s hot. Process inspiration incrementally, and pick the pieces that raise most enthusiasm at any given moment. Those pieces will generate most new creative value.</p><h4> <span id="Creative_explosion_vs._deadlines"> Creative explosion vs. deadlines </span></h4><p>Excess creativity and wish to include valuable information or ideas may cause an unstoppable bloat of writing materials and a never-ending writing loop.

As long as strict <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">priorities</a> are applied, loss of value to the main article should be minimized.</p><h3> <span id="Disadvantages_of_incremental_writing"> Disadvantages of incremental writing </span></h3><p>Incremental writing will always be superior over linear writing for a class of non-fiction texts, however, the toolkit is difficult to master, and the strategies are not obvious. This is a new set of techniques that requires a high degree of innovative thinking on the part of the author. This is why we do not expect any significant degree of adoption at the moment. Incremental writing should primarily be considered by authors who are already masters of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>.</p><h2> <span id="Incremental_brainstorming"> Incremental brainstorming </span></h2><p>If you combine incremental learning with <a href="#Incremental_problem_solving">incremental problem solving</a> and plain old brainstorming, you will arrive at <em>incremental brainstorming</em>. The brainstorming part may be executed face-to-face or over e-mail.</p><p>Incremental brainstorming sounds like an oxymoron. Incremental brainstorming has very little to do with &#34;storming&#34;, but it makes a very good use of the brain&#39;s capacity to build creative associations in fertile knowledge-rich conditions. Incremental brainstorming might be slow, but it can deliver more than plain face-to-face brainstorming. At worst, the outcome will be different, and in creative work, this is always a desirable complementary effect.</p><p>In face-to-face brainstorming, two or more brains, preferably with different strengths, specializations, and biases, engage into a fast exchange of ideas, where Idea X from Brain A might generate ideas Y and Z from Brain B, which in turn may cause a chain reaction of creative inspiration in other participating brains. Moreover, brainstorming requires a degree of mental discipline that may be missing in brainstorming with oneself (in one&#39;s mind, i.e. without incremental learning). Converting thoughts to speech slows down the thinking, but increases the discipline and may dramatically enhance creative outcomes.</p><p>In incremental brainstorming, this process is taken a few steps further. Incremental learning is a form of brainstorming with oneself, as mentioned in the <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/read.htm#Creativity_boost">Creativity</a></strong> section, however, it can also be used in remote brainstorming via e-mail. The main tools of remote incremental brainstorming are:</p><ol><li> incremental learning (for processing knowledge),</li><li> <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/e-mail.htm">incremental mail processing</a> (for processing exchanged ideas), and</li><li> e-mail communication (which may be supplemented by live video).</li></ol><p>Incremental brainstorming may be slow, and yet it adds an additional degree of discipline with an archive of written communications. Most of all, it adds more sources of inspiration to the mix. In addition to the participating brains, incremental brainstorming adds inspiration from external sources of knowledge (with non-participating authors providing further inspiration). It also adds from the history of the communication. Due to forgetting, incremental brainstorming makes it possible to brainstorm with one&#39;s past self. In other words, the participants of incremental brainstorming include:</p><ol><li> participating brains,</li><li> past versions of participating brains, and</li><li>  non-participating authors from the past and the present.</li></ol><h3> <span id="Advantages_of_incremental_brainstorming"> Advantages of incremental brainstorming </span></h3><p>The main advantages of incremental brainstorming are:</p><ul><li><strong>wider knowledge</strong>: involvement of incremental learning in expanding upon the discussed ideas substantially extends the knowledge used in the creative process. This is a way of adding non-participating brains to the mix</li><li><strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a></strong>: when brainstorming is slowed down, fading memory traces evoke the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a> that may:<ol><li>provide for better long-term consolidation of ideas, and</li><li>evoke new creative reasoning pathways in cases where the fading signal needs to be rebuilt via new pathway searches.</li></ol>This is particularly valuable for hard-to-solve problems that may require the involvement of long-term memory and all its advantages (incl. problem modelling)</li><li><strong>circadian synchronization</strong>: participating brains do not need to synchronize their peek performance hours (e.g. when working over different times zones)</li><li><strong>sleep</strong>: few people realize the monumental role of sleep in creativity. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/sleep.htm#Neural_optimization_in_sleep">Neural optimization of memories in sleep</a> works like an automatic creative thinker that is autonomous from the conscious brain even though it feeds on creative processes that occur in waking. <strong>Sleep is an organizer of memories and can convert results of brainstorming into new quality</strong>. Incremental brainstorming is slower, it may span weeks or months. As such, it employs sleep mechanisms as new autonomous brains in the creative process. Sleep converts the chaos of data into abstract models that yield higher quality reasoning</li><li><strong>balancing attention and creativity</strong>: in all creative pursuits, striking the ideal balance between creativity and attention is vital for the ultimate success. Our multitasking society is pretty good at stimulating creativity, however, the same factors that boost creativity have a destructive impact on attention. Incremental brainstorming helps you strike a balance between focused individual work and pulling the team brains together. You can brainstorm without ever interrupting each other</li><li><strong>free from reliance on the coincidence of interests</strong>: face-to-face brainstorming often fails due to differing levels of interests or motivations in the participating parties. Moderating face-to-face and adding a bigger dose of incremental brainstorming may be an easy solution. In those cases, most of the workload may shift to a single brain, while still capitalizing on the contribution of the less involved brains</li></ul><h3> <span id="Disadvantages_of_incremental_brainstorming"> Disadvantages of incremental brainstorming </span></h3><p>The main disadvantage of incremental brainstorming is its snail&#39;s speed. Naturally, it won&#39;t be of much value right before a project&#39;s deadline. However, despite the hype speed receives in the media in reference to technological progress, the hardest problems are always solved by collective efforts of multiple brains working over generations. Incremental brainstorming might be less useful in hurrying a new iPad model, but it would be handy in slowly developing or slowly adopting theories like those of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin" rel="nofollow">Darwin</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel" rel="nofollow">Mendel</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Wegener" rel="nofollow">Wegener</a>, and the like.</p><h3> <span id="Future_of_brainstorming"> Future of brainstorming </span></h3><p>Incremental brainstorming is not intended to replace face-to-face interactive collaboration. However, it should serve as its rich supplement. It carries all the advantages of incremental learning: creativity, attention, prioritization, meticulousness, consolidation, long-term sustainability based on long-term memories, and more. It requires a lot of training before it brings fruits. Therefore, if problem solving or creative work are vital for your progress, you might consider mastering the following progression of skills: classical SuperMemo (for better memory), incremental reading (for processing text), incremental learning (for overall learning), incremental problem solving (for employing knowledge in solving problems), to finally arrive at incremental brainstorming, i.e. combining incremental learning with classical brainstorming.</p><h2> <span id="User.27s_take:_Creative_elaboration"> User&#39;s take: Creative elaboration </span></h2><h2> <span id="Neural_learning_with_SuperMemo"> Neural learning with SuperMemo </span></h2><p>SuperMemo 17 introduces a new form of <strong>incremental learning</strong>, which we will call <strong>neural learning</strong>. In neural learning, SuperMemo serves the student with knowledge associated with a selected subject, article, picture, etc. Knowledge is served in a neural way, i.e. by sequentially exploring semantic connections in a networks of information build automatically or manually in SuperMemo. SuperMemo takes inspiration from how the brain works. Creativity enhanced with SuperMemo is very slow, but it is targeted and methodical. <strong>Neural creativity works like a slow brain extended by memories stored in SuperMemo.</strong> Neural learning is particularly useful in research, problem solving, creative writing, explorative learning, etc. In other words, you may not find neural learning particularly useful in mastering a course of physics, however, if you are a physicist working on a complex problem that requires associating knowledge from different fields of physics and beyond, you will notice that this form of learning has a fantastic impact on your creative productivity.</p><p>Neural learning was the main reason for SuperMemo 17 to introduce a new type of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a>: <strong>concepts</strong>. A concept in SuperMemo is an equivalent of an important idea, which can be connected with other elements (incl. other concepts). In addition to connections between concepts, neural learning also explores connections between elements using the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Knowledge_tree">knowledge tree</a>. Elements connected via concepts form <strong>concept maps</strong>, which, in addition to the knowledge tree, from the primary skeleton for explorations in neural learning.</p><p>In the following sections, the essential terms and notions underlying neural learning will be introduced gradually: <a href="#Concepts">concepts</a>, <a href="#Spreading_activation">spreading activation</a>, <a href="#Neural_review">neural review</a>, etc. Even if this may sound overwhelming at first, remember that you can start neural learning now with just one keystroke: <em>Ctrl+F2</em> (<strong>Go neural</strong>).

It takes inspiration from how the brain follows associated ideas. Neural review automates the review of knowledge associated with selected concepts or ideas, e.g. in problem solving, creative writing, etc. </p><p>For example, in a neural review of <em>dogs</em>, there is a good chance of learning about <em>puppies</em> or <em>pooddles</em>, but there is also a chance of learning about <em>cats</em> and somewhat lesser chance of learning about <em>cars</em>. Similarly, if you see a picture of a banana plant, going neural on that picture will help you review associated elements (e.g. other pictures of plants, or articles about bananas, or <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> associated with the same <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Concept">concept</a> such as <em>gardening</em>). </p><p>A <strong>concept</strong> in SuperMemo is an important idea or subject. Concepts are a new type of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> that can be linked with other elements. The network of <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Link">links</a> based on concepts will be called a <strong>concept map</strong>. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">Elements</a> can also form <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Link">links</a> between each other. In SuperMemo, knowledge is also connected by inheritance, and the structure of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Knowledge_tree">knowledge tree</a>. </p><p><a href="#Spreading_activation">Spreading activation</a> in neural networks is a method of searching the network with the use of network connections and weights. </p><p>Neural review follows the <em>spread of neural activation</em> in a network of inter-element connections. All the links and connections in SuperMemo can be used to simulate a spread of activation in the network of knowledge where individual <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> play a role of neurons. </p><p>All <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Link">links</a> used in spreading activation receive weights based on their importance. In SuperMemo, weights are determined by <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Priority">element priority</a> and the priorities of individual knowledge associations (e.g. concept connections are of higher priority than the sibling relationship in the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Knowledge_tree">knowledge tree</a>). </p><p>In spreading activation, we can sequence the propagation wave by the time of activation of individual nodes, which are formed by SuperMemo <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a>. Such a sequence can then be used as the basis of a semantic review in the incremental learning process. </p><p>Neural review can be initiated by executing <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/learnmenu.htm">Learn</a> : <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/learnmenu.htm#Go_neural">Go neural</a></strong> (<em>Ctrl+F2</em>) from the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/main.htm">main menu</a>. </p><p>Neural review carries a degree of randomness. As such it can be very helpful in associating ideas in neural creativity. Connectivity and randomness underlie the main rationale behind neural review: <strong>neural creativity</strong> and <strong>neural problem solving</strong>. In those approaches, we combine a creative process or a problem solving process with an exploration of new subjects, while executing <strong>incremental learning</strong> in the background. In other words, neural review serves learning that is to instantly bring benefits in the shape of new ideas and new problems solved in conditions of incomplete human knowledge and in combination with abundant and possibly contradictory computer-stored knowledge.

If you are familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map" rel="nofollow">mind maps</a>, you will be happy to know that the cost of building your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Concept_map">concept maps</a> is far less. At times, all you need for your creative purposes is a conceptual link between two different subjects where you expect to find creative associations. To execute your neural review or to engage in neural creativity, pick your <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Concept">concept</a>, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">element</a> or a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Registry_member">registry member</a> (e.g. a picture) and <strong>Go Neural</strong>.</p><p><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Concept">Concepts</a> and inter-element <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Link">links</a> form the primary framework for <a href="#Spreading_activation">spreading activation</a>. The <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Knowledge_tree">knowledge tree</a> comes next. Activation might actually be infinite if it was costless. SuperMemo goes into just a few layers of activation in a single <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Repetition">repetition</a> or when building the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Neural_queue">neural queue</a> for the first time. This takes milliseconds on a fast PC, but might drag for a second on older computers. SuperMemo adds more layers of activation in successive <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Repetition">repetitions</a>. Those can be useful for remote associations, but you are unlikely to go through more than just a layer in a single session. The queue then becomes a tool for building your understanding how the activation is spreading in the network. </p><p>For example, if you are a doctor who is to make a diagnosis for a specific patient, you can set up a diagnostic <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Concept">concept</a> and link chief suspects in a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Concept_map">concept map</a>. <strong>Go neural</strong> to see what new ideas come to your mind while learning new topics at the same time.</p><h2> <span id="Spreading_activation"> Spreading activation </span></h2><p><strong>Spreading activation</strong> is an algorithm for activating nodes in a neural network, semantic network, directed graph, etc. In <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#SuperMemo">SuperMemo</a>, the graph is formed by semantic connections of the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Knowledge_tree">knowledge tree</a>, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Link">concept links and inter-element links</a>. <strong>Spreading activation</strong> is used to sequence <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Element">elements</a> for <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Neural_review">neural review</a>.

Note that this sequence will differ each time you create a new queue. Spreading activation is subject to &#34;race conditions&#34;.

In neural review, SuperMemo successively feeds the user with knowledge associated with a selected topic or a chosen subset of topics. When a network of conceptual <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Link">links</a> connects areas of knowledge, they form semantic space that can be explored in a neural manner that helps forming new associations, and generate ideas. This process is conducive to research, invention, problem solving, etc. Metaphorically speaking, neural creativity helps emulate a thinking process in a human brain extended by knowledge stored in SuperMemo. </p><p>Neural creativity employs the incremental learning process to produce new ideas in a neural fashion. In neural creativity, closely related <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Concept">concepts</a> are more likely to show up when executing a neural review of a studied subject. If you are fluent in <strong>incremental learning</strong>, you may wonder how a neural review differs from a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/review.htm#Semantic_review">semantic review</a>. The main difference is that in semantic review the whole burden of juggling the semantics is in your hands. You need to know the tools of <strong>incremental learning</strong> to execute a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/review.htm#Semantic_review">semantic review</a> well. In neural review, the whole process will be reduced to pressing a single button in SuperMemo.</p><p>Unlike it is the case with semantic review in SuperMemo, or simply googling for knowledge, the whole process of associating pieces of knowledge is automated. To give it a try, pick a subject and <strong>Go neural</strong> (<em>Ctrl+F2</em>).</p><h2> <span id="Incremental_approach"> Incremental approach </span></h2><p><strong>Incremental learning</strong> can be used to creatively come up with new ideas. This raises some skepticism. Here is an exemplary skeptical voice:</p><blockquote><em>&#34;How can interruption be good for creativity or problem solving? Isn&#39;t it that all great discoveries come from continual, persistent and focused effort? It is those who can dedicate themselves to a cause that achieve best results. Most people fail because they major in minor things. They do many things superficially. They are jacks of all trade and masters of none. Incremental learning seems like an effort to major in everything. Putting too much on one&#39;s own plate&#34;.</em></blockquote><p>This question keeps popping back in various contexts. Here is an illustrative answer based on the fact that creativity and problem solving are based on forming new connections in your brain.</p><p><strong>Incremental recall: bringing back things to memory, piece by piece</strong></p><p>Imagine you had a very eventful day. For example, a visit to an exotic city, meeting an old good friend, or attending a breakthrough conference. Imagine that your inspiration is so rich that you want to write a detailed report of the day (assuming you did not capture it all with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass" rel="nofollow">Google Glass</a>). The first thing to do is to sit down to writing a report and list all essential keywords for rebuilding the memory of the day. Once you write the outline, you can quickly notice that it does not take long before you come up blank for new memories. You cannot recall any more details. This is normal. Sitting down over a blank piece of paper for an hour may not be the best use of your time. It may be pretty unproductive. However, if you keep your piece of paper handy, you may notice that it keeps filling up with new memories as they keep popping up in your head in different contexts. An image, a smell, or an article in press may all contribute to unexpected recall. If you happen to execute <strong>incremental learning</strong> in the meantime, you will notice that the process of recall is intensified. If your learning materials are rich, you are likely to read about dozens of unrelated subjects in a single day. All those subjects produce new associations. Your blank piece of paper will fill up much faster than it is the case in the course of ordinary life or if your learning was less varied. What you witness here is incremental recall. </p><p>There is a short step from incremental recall to incremental creativity. Both are based on incrementally building a mental structure in your mind. In case of recall, you will recover past memories. In case of creativity, you will additionally add</p><ol><li> new pieces of knowledge acquired via <strong>incremental learning</strong> (e.g. neural review), and</li><li> new memories and/or ideas you have not experienced or thought of before.</li></ol><p>Finally, in problem solving, you will direct this creative process towards accomplishing a specific task: solving a problem, answering a question, etc.</p><h2> <span id="Examples_of_neural_creativity"> Examples of neural creativity </span></h2><p>Neural tools in SuperMemo equip the user with a sort of Einstein&#39;s brain in slow motion. You can build a brain of knowledge as big as you wish. You can make your networks of ideas as complex as you wish. And then you can just press one button to start a train of thought at your own pace while watching all new ideas form in front of your eyes. Here are some examples of the neural approach in SuperMemo:</p><h3> <span id="Medical_diagnosis"> Medical diagnosis </span></h3><p>Physicians and medical students always have a mountain of new health-related knowledge to process. This is also true of all individuals who care about health. A specific problem to solve, e.g. a medical diagnosis, may also be a good excuse for acquiring new knowledge neural style. For example, if a patient presents with a skin condition, a dedicated <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Concept">concept</a> might be created (e.g. <em>Patient John Doe condition</em>). <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Link">Conceptual links</a> can then be made to relevant fields of knowledge, e.g. skin conditions, allergies, bacterial skin infections, mycoses, etc. Neural review will provide new inspiration for new areas to explore. Two birds can be killed with one stone:</p><ol><li> new knowledge acquired for future use, and</li><li> zeroing in on the ultimate diagnosis.</li></ol><h3> <span id="Solving_a_software_problem"> Solving a software problem </span></h3><p>Neural review has already been helpful in solving problems that pester users of SuperMemo (e.g. <a href="http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Cloze_deletions_get_shifted_by_one_character" rel="nofollow">misaligned cloze deletion</a>, due to bugs in Internet Explorer). When a pesky problem shows up, all ideas and new areas of related knowledge can be associated with a <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Concept">concept</a> that defines the problem (e.g. <em>cloze bug</em>).</p><p>In the case of the &#34;cloze bug&#34;, several users sent their ideas on how to possibly solve the problem. None of these worked. In the end, all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model" rel="nofollow">DOM</a>-related ideas turned out to be a blind path. However, initiating neural review provided an ultimate incentive with a hope for a light in the tunnel. Could the problem be solved without neural review? Yes. Perhaps, neural review helped step out of the box in looking for solutions? If not, it might at least have had a psychological effect: <em>&#34;if nothing works, perhaps neural review will?&#34;</em>.</p><h3> <span id="Creative_writing"> Creative writing </span></h3><p><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/creativity.htm#Incremental_writing">Incremental writing</a> is useful if you want to compile a number of texts into a larger body. Neural approach may be useful if you want to combine that procedure with a degree of research. You may either want to research a topic (e.g. when looking for facts or literature related to your thesis), or research your own texts if they are too voluminous and highly repetitive (e.g. to look for simpler phrasing, more logical sequencing, clearer line of thought, etc.).</p><h3> <span id="Forensic_science"> Forensic science </span></h3><p>Forensics is an excellent example of where neural approach may appear useful. A complex case may involve a great deal of case-specific knowledge that needs to be combined with scientific and general knowledge. Wherever the size of knowledge goes well beyond the capacity of human memory, and where the solution may require thinking &#34;out of the box&#34;, neural approach may act as an extension to the human mind. Once a case is solved, case-independent knowledge may be integrated with the main learning <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Collection">collection</a> to secure the long-term investment in knowledge.</p><h2> <span id="See_also"> See also </span></h2><ul><li> <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/en/blog/how-to-improve-creativity-with-SuperMemo">SuperMemo Blog: Neural Creativity</a></li></ul><p>SuperMemo always had to struggle with myths slowing down its popularization. Preventing the reappearance of myths appears to be a never-ending battle. The knowledge about SuperMemo has grown to a substantial volume. Not all users can afford reading dozens of articles. Many users are bound to arrive to the same wrong conclusions independently of others. Some of these myths are rooted in general myths of memory. Others seem to spring from the common sense thinking about learning. Here are some most damaging myths related to spaced repetition, SuperMemo, and incremental learning.</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_Many_people_are_successful_without_using_SuperMemo.2C_hence_its_importance_is_secondary"> Myth: Many people are successful without using SuperMemo, hence its importance is secondary </span></h3><p><strong>Myth: Many people are successful without using SuperMemo, hence its importance is secondary</strong>.</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_Natural_mechanisms_for_selecting_important_memories_are_good_enough._We_do_not_need_a_crutch"> Myth: Natural mechanisms for selecting important memories are good enough.

The evolution produced an effective forgetting mechanism that frees our memory from space-consuming and perhaps irrelevant garbage. This mechanism proved efficient enough to build the amazing human civilization. Consequently, many believe that there cannot be much room for improvement.</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_We_cannot_improve_memory_by_training"> Myth: We cannot improve memory by training </span></h3><p><strong>Myth: We cannot improve memory by training</strong>. Infinite memory is a popular optimist&#39;s myth. A pessimist&#39;s myth is that we cannot improve our memory via training. Even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_James" rel="nofollow">William James</a> in his genius book <em><a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/James/Principles/" rel="nofollow">The Principles of Psychology (1890)</a></em> wrote with certainty that memory does not change unless for the worse (e.g. as a result of aging or disease).</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_SuperMemo_repetitions_take_too_much_time_to_make_it_worthwhile"> Myth: SuperMemo repetitions take too much time to make it worthwhile </span></h3><p><strong>Myth: SuperMemo repetitions take too much time to make it worthwhile</strong>.

No <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">item</a> added to SuperMemo is considered &#34;memorized for good&#34;. For that reasons, all <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> are subject to review sooner or later. There must therefore be an inevitable increase in the cost of repetitions.</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_People_differ_in_the_speed_of_learning.2C_but_they_all_forget_at_the_same_speed"> Myth: People differ in the speed of learning, but they all forget at the same speed </span></h3><p><strong>Myth: People differ in the speed of learning, but they all forget at the same speed</strong>.</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_Hypertext_can_substitute_for_memory"> Myth: Hypertext can substitute for memory </span></h3><p><strong>Myth: Hypertext can substitute for memory</strong>. An amazingly large proportion of the population holds memorization in contempt. Terms &#34;<em>rote memorization</em>&#34;, &#34;<em>recitatory rehearsal</em>&#34;, &#34;<em>mindless repetition</em>&#34; are used to label any form of memorization or repetition as unintelligent. Seeing the &#34;<em>big picture</em>&#34;, &#34;<em>reasoning</em>&#34; and leaving the job of remembering to external hypertext sources are supposed to be viable substitutes.</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_We_do_not_need_SuperMemo.2C_all_we_need_is_to_build_an_index_to_knowledge_sources"> Myth: We do not need SuperMemo, all we need is to build an index to knowledge sources </span></h3><p><strong>Myth: We do not need SuperMemo, all we need is to build an index to knowledge sources</strong>. With multiple on-line sources of knowledge, some people are tempted to believe that all we are supposed to learn is a sort of index to these external sources of knowledge.</p><h4> <span id="Index_to_knowledge"> Index to knowledge </span></h4><p>A less extreme version of &#34;<a href="#Myth:_Memorization_is_not_needed">memorization is not needed</a>&#34; myth, is that &#34;we only need to remember an index to knowledge&#34;. It is true that abstract knowledge and general concepts are most useful. However, this type of knowledge is also subject to forgetting. Moreover, not all knowledge is inferential. To reason about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica" rel="nofollow">Antarctica</a>, we often need to know that it is cold. We might derive the temperature conclusion from the position of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica" rel="nofollow">Antarctica</a> on the map, but we need the knowledge of the map, the knowledge of the climate, and the knowledge of the earth&#39;s position in reference to the sun. Any kid will admit that it is simpler to just remember that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica" rel="nofollow">Antarctica</a> is white and cold. In this case, rules are more useful, but facts are easier to remember.</p><p>A <em>mere mortal</em> will usually be aware that doughnuts are foods that should better be avoided by people who fear a heart disease. The fact &#34;<em>Doughnuts ain&#39;t good for heart</em>&#34; contributes to an average man&#39;s knowledge about health. This fact probably does not need SuperMemo. After all, most of us will refresh the knowledge about doughnuts and the heart each time we see a tasty doughnut. The <em>Doughnut Fact</em> contributes also to our <em>index to knowledge</em>. It is enough to jump to Google and type <em>+doughnut +heart</em> to make a good use of this particular entry in our index. The search will help us recover more knowledge about the <em>relationship</em> between doughnuts and the heart.</p><p>If we want to enhance our ability to think and conclude about doughnuts and the heart, we might try to remember the following:</p><ol><li> <strong>Fact 1</strong>: <em>Doughnuts are high in trans fatty acids</em></li><li> <strong>Rule 1</strong>: <em>Trans fatty acids in foods tend to lower <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein" rel="nofollow">HDLs</a> (high-density lipoproteins)</em></li><li> <strong>Rule 2</strong>: <em>Lower blood <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-density_lipoprotein" rel="nofollow">HDLs</a> are a major risk factor in cardiovascular disorders (e.g. arteriosclerosis)</em></li></ol><p>There is an advantage to knowing the above facts and rules: upon finding out that <em>French fries are high in trans fatty acids</em>, we will be able to use <strong>Rule 1</strong> and <strong>Rule 2</strong> to derive a new fact: <em>French fries ain&#39;t good for the heart</em>. The awareness of the above rules will increase our reasoning ability. In the terminology of knowledge engineering, we will be able to derive new facts and rules from the existing set of facts and rules. In plain language, we will know more than we have actually learned. We will be able to conclude more. We will become <em>more intelligent</em> (if intelligence was defined as <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/genius.htm">the inferential ability of the human mind</a>).</p><p>Yet there is a downside to remembering the <em>trans fat rules</em>. They are not as plain as the <em>Doughnut Fact</em>, and they may not effectively be refreshed upon a sight of a doughnut. Consequently, we may simply forget the link between <em>doughnuts</em>, <em>trans fat</em>, and <em>the heart</em>. This is where SuperMemo comes to play a role. It will help you refresh the <em>trans fat rules</em>. It will minimize the number of reviews in lifetime. In other words, it will help you keep the <em>trans fat rules</em> in your forgetful memory. Thus SuperMemo makes sure that your &#34;<em>index to knowledge</em>&#34; remains intact in your mind.</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_In_incremental_reading.2C_you_spend_mere_seconds_reading_a_topic"> Myth: In incremental reading, you spend mere seconds reading a topic </span></h3><p><strong>Myth: In incremental reading, you spend mere seconds reading a topic</strong>.</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_Memorization_is_not_needed"> Myth: Memorization is not needed </span></h3><p><strong>Myth: Memorization is not needed</strong>.</p><ul><li> If memorization was not needed, we could travel around the world without learning languages.

I will check it out on my computer</em></li><li> If memorization was not needed, all exams such as SAT, GRE, TEOFL, FCE, GCSE, USMLE, etc. would be a great waste of human time and resources.

Nearly all parents seem to prefer to choose the former for their kids.</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_High_retention_results_in_slow_learning"> Myth: High retention results in slow learning </span></h3><p><strong>Myth: High retention results in slow learning</strong>.</p><ul><li> <strong>high-retention-low-volume learning</strong> (as in early versions of SuperMemo) - in which you make sure you remember 95 or more percent of the studied material</li><li> <strong>low-retention-high-volume learning</strong> (as in traditional forms of learning) - in which you quickly process large chunks of the material while having to struggle with massive forgetting</li></ul><p>Reading books belongs to the low-retention category, while memorizing 10-20 <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> per day with SuperMemo belongs to the high-retention category. The optimum reading strategy will find the golden mean between these two. You should not give up traditional reading. Neither should you expect to put all your study material into SuperMemo. You should choose a middle-ground strategy. For example, if you consistently spend 90% of your time on reading and 10% of your time on adding <strong>most important</strong> findings to SuperMemo, your reading speed will actually decline only by some 10%, while the <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a> of the most important pieces will be as high as programmed in SuperMemo (i.e. usually 95%).</p><p><a href="#Incremental_reading">Incremental reading</a> provides you with a precise tool for finding the optimum balance between speed and <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Retention">retention</a>. You will ensure high-retention of the most important pieces of text, while a large proportion of time will be spent reading at speeds comparable or higher than those typical of traditional book reading.</p><p>It is worth noting that the learning speed limit in high-retention learning is imposed by your memory. If &#34;memorizing&#34; one-book-per-year sounds like a major disappointment, the roots of this lay in human memory. Our current knowledge of psychophysiology and pharmacology does not provide any means that could allow of breaking beyond those limits. We are left with the choice between high-speed and high-retention. Incremental reading gives you a full hands-on control over finding the optimum balance.</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_We_are_good_at_remembering_important_things"> Myth: We are good at remembering important things </span></h3><p><strong>Myth: We are good at remembering important things</strong>.</p><p>Modern life has changed the hierarchy of value and importance of knowledge. The link between importance and repeated use has been severed. A flashy lingerie billboard we see every morning is not likely to be more important than dozens of volatile facts pertaining to our professional life. Regrettably, there is no circuit in our brain that would let us consciously etch important memories: <em>This is important! I must not forget it!</em> All we can do is to use the trick of reverberation or mnemonic techniques which... still will usually not last long unless we apply <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a> as in SuperMemo.</p><p>If memory had an excellent ability to retain important information:</p><ol><li> you would not tremble before an exam and confusingly run through the notes to be sure that at the zero hour you won&#39;t suffer from a blackout. At the same time, you could easily recall details of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzenegger" rel="nofollow">Schwarzenegger</a> movie seen last evening or even weeks before the exam. Clearly, Arnie beats the ups and downs of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman" rel="nofollow">Ottoman Empire</a>. And if you think the Ottoman Empire had much greater an impact on humanity than the island shootout in <em>Commando</em>, you are still likely to remember the muscle and the machine gun far better than the timeline of the sultans</li><li> you would never have problems with recalling the date of your mother-in-law&#39;s birthday. This is a piece of data that is critical to your marital harmony!</li><li> you should instantly forget the Olympic champions in football in Atlanta 1996 or Munich 1972. After all this might be a classic case of unimportant knowledge. Yet few Africans would forget how Nigeria beat Argentina 4:3 in 1996. Similarly, few Poles would forget the most memorable moment in the history of Polish football: Olympic championship in Munich.</li></ol><p>The truth is that we excellently remember only things that are both easy to remember and repeated frequently enough. The brain does not have an internal measure of importance (other than limited volitional control or control via repeated exposure)! Your memory storage ruthlessly deletes your career-critical knowledge with the same ease as it ravages the traces of last year&#39;s golf scores or contributing names listed at the end of a boring soap opera. SuperMemo will ensure you remember your mission critical data. What is in, stays in your memory. What is out, is free to go.</p><h3> <span id="Myth:_We_remember_useful_things_because_we_use_them"> Myth: We remember useful things because we use them </span></h3><p><strong>Myth: We remember useful things because we use them</strong>.</p><ul><li> <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spacing_effect">spacing effect</a></strong> (frequently used memories may be very volatile): if you use things often, e.g. a credit card&#39;s pin code, you may surprised by a sudden unexpected <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Lapse">lapse of memory</a>! The facts that are used too often or are too obvious, do not challenge the memory system well enough. They are remembered superficially. Any break from use, stress, change of context, or innocent interference from other memories may cause a sudden inability to recall a fact from memory. Even SuperMemo may not help in those cases. Those easy <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Item">items</a> often grow their <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Interval">intervals</a> fast and cannot prevent the spacing effect.</li><li> <strong>tunnel vision</strong>: when we rely on frequently used memories, we are slow at expanding our horizons. With <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spaced_repetition">spaced repetition</a>, you can quickly grow stable and coherent knowledge into new areas. This expansion is not easy or even possible when relying on frequent use. A conscious intervention is necessary. In an extreme case, you might ask a cat why it does not master mathematics. In a cat&#39;s tunnel vision, simple goals lead to a narrow set of factual knowledge that is needed and remembered. A cat will never fly to Mars (on its own).</li></ul><p>Opponents of SuperMemo often say: &#34;<em>Whatever knowledge I need, I use often. If I use it often, I do not forget</em>&#34;. This is a false conviction. <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Spacing_effect">Spacing effect</a> and forgetting are unpredictable. The whole world of useful things escapes your brain on a daily basis. You may say that if need to fly to Mars, you can just read about math tools that you find useful. However, the tool that is useless today might be useful in 5 years, or tomorrow, when you tackle a different problem. You need the whole toolset ready in your mind. The associative power of the extra knowledge just makes you a better problem solver and a stronger thinker.</p><p>Tunnel vision effect may be counteracted with extensive reading, however, there is no better way of reading than <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>.</p><p>Incremental learning might be as important to SuperMemo as the original <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/english/princip.htm">repetition spacing idea</a>. Incremental learning eliminates a number of bottlenecks that limit various stages of <em><a href="#Knowledge_acquisition:_Areas_of_optimization">knowledge acquisition</a></em>.</p><p>The name <em><a href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a></em> first appeared in SuperMemo 2000. However, the concept is not new. It originated from combining our natural reading habits with the demands of <em><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/smintro.htm">spaced repetition (SuperMemo)</a></em>. We rarely pick up a book and read it cover-to-cover in one go. At school we often dig through a number textbooks used for different courses. At home we stop reading a book to read a newspaper and then stop reading the newspaper to watch TV. A combination of needs and interests determines how far we go with the reading of an individual text. SuperMemo drives this concept to an extreme by letting you read just one sentence from one chapter from one book and then go on to reading <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> from a thousand books and/or articles. SuperMemo&#39;s contribution here is only the management of this multi-source reading process. As for the creative aspect of <a href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr" rel="nofollow">Niels Bohr</a> is known to have used the power ofintermitted reading and intermitted thinking to maximize his creative output. He would keep dozens of shelves with outlines of ideas. He would return to individual shelves from time to time, esp. if he was inspired by a conversation, thinking, experiment, or reading. He would then keep reading a single shelf, think and ponder, add new notes, etc. Many of those shelves ended up as scientific publications. In that sense, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr" rel="nofollow">Niels Bohr</a> employed rudimentary <a href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> in his creative work.</p><p>The approach used in incremental reading is widely employed by many creative individuals. Even if it is far less formal that <a href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> or even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr" rel="nofollow">Bohr</a>&#39;s approach. <a href="http://www.planetary.org/html/mmp/scien/gazzm/gazzm70.htm" rel="nofollow">Dr Michael Gazzaniga</a> puts it this way: &#34;<em>I think the creative process is directly related to the amount of time one spends mulling something over. I come back and revisit ideas, data, thoughts, all the time. I think this keeps key semantic networks active and then &#34;bingo&#34; an inconsistency or consistency suddenly presents itself to consciousness and the beginnings of a new idea appear</em>&#34;.</p><p>Here is a brief history of incremental reading:</p><ul><li> <strong>Before SuperMemo (1980)</strong>: The author of SuperMemo and co-author of this incrementally written text, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/english/company/wozniak.htm">Piotr Wozniak</a>, in his student years, used his own &#34;cross-the-notebook&#34; method of learning. He would go through his paper notes and cross out those he was sure he would remember for the exam. He would read his notes over and over again until all the notes have been crossed out. Each pass was faster as there was less and less to read. That method was nearly a guarantee of excellent exam results. All his lecture notes were covered with crossed out shapes that surrounded pictures and portions of text. This &#34;granular treatment&#34; with &#34;processing attributes&#34; can be thought of as an early inspiration for future <a href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a></li><li> <strong>SuperMemo algorithm (1984-1985)</strong> - The first ever attempt to measure <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Optimum_interval">optimum intervals</a> in learning resulted in the formulation of the SuperMemo method in 1985</li><li> <strong>SuperMemo 1.0 (1987)</strong> - The birth of SuperMemo is also the birth of <em>computational spaced repetition</em>, i.e. the use of computers in computing <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Optimum_interval">optimum intervals</a> in learning</li><li> <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/english/sms.htm">SuperMemo 2 - SuperMemo 98 (1987-1998)</a></strong> - In the years 1987-1998, users of SuperMemo had only two alternatives in the area of collecting learning material for learning with SuperMemo:<ol><li> type it in and formulate it manually, or</li><li>  obtain ready-made learning material from a colleague, SuperMemo Library, etc.</li></ol></li></ul><dl><dd> The only way SuperMemo supported learning from electronic sources was via <strong>Copy</strong> and <strong>Paste</strong>.</dd></dl><ul><li> <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/soft/sm99.htm">SuperMemo 99 (1999)</a></strong> made the first step towards efficient reading of electronic articles by introducing <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/read.htm">reading lists</a> and the first primitive reading tools: <strong>Extract</strong> and <strong>Cloze</strong>. Reading lists were prioritized lists of articles to read. Extracts made it possible to split larger articles into smaller portions. Clozes made it possible to convert short sentences into question-answer format by means of <em><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">cloze deletions</a></em> (i.e. fill-in-the-blank questions)</li><li> <strong><a href="http://www.super-memory.com/articles/soft/sm10.htm">SuperMemo 2000</a></strong> greatly increased the efficiency of reading by introducing the concept of <em><a href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a></em>. Incremental reading makes it possible to simultaneously read dozens of articles. Each article is read in small increments fully controlled and prioritized by the user and/or the default learning process. Components of <a href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> introduced in SuperMemo 2000: new <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#A-Factor">A-Factor</a>-based <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Topic">topic</a> repetition scheme (i.e. the learning algorithm), <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Read-point">read points</a>, formatting in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Extract">extracts</a> and in <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/g.htm#Cloze_deletion">clozes</a> (SuperMemo 99 would ignore formatting), text highlights, source article link, <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/readbar.htm">reading toolbar</a>, <a href="#Subset_review">subset learning</a>, subset <a href="http://www.super-memory.com/help/postpone.htm">postpone</a>, and support for longer articles (SuperMemo 99 was limited to 64K articles)</li><li> <strong><a href="http://super-memo.com/supermemo/supermemo2002.html" rel="nofollow">SuperMemo 2002</a></strong> brought <a href="#Incremental_reading">incremental reading</a> to a new level.
