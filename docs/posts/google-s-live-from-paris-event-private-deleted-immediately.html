    <h1>Google&#39;s live from Paris event private/deleted immediately</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Just watched the &#39;Google Live from Paris&#39; event and it looked like a non-event to me.</p><p>It seems that the livestream event was set private after it ended. (It was unlisted to begin with) They even forgot the phone used to demonstrate multisearch.</p><p>This suggests to me that Google is finally getting disrupted and are scrambling of desperation because of the release of ChatGPT.</p></div></div></div>
