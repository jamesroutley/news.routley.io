While revenue is still growing, the effort came after the company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/26/alphabet-is-set-to-report-q2-earnings-after-the-bell-.html">reported</a> its second consecutive quarter of weaker-than-expected earnings and revenue. </p><p>However, prior to that, employees early in the year had given the company&#39;s leadership particularly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/14/google-employees-growing-unhappy-with-pay-and-promotions-survey-shows.html">poor marks</a> on pay, promotions and execution, citing the company’s growing bureaucracy, which executives acknowledged at the time. </p><p>“Across everything we do, we can be slower to make decisions,” Pichai said Tuesday. &#34;You look at it end-to-end and figure out how to make the company 20% more productive.”</p><p>Pichai also gave more specific examples of how he hopes to do that. He gave a past example of aligning YouTube Music and Google Play Music into one product.</p><p>“Sometimes there are areas to make progress [where] you have three people making decisions, understanding that and bringing it down to two or one improves efficiency by 20%,” he gave in another example.</p><p>In a July all-hands meeting, HR chief Fiona Cicconi acknowledged industrywide concerns about layoffs, but said the company at the time was &#34;not currently looking to reduce Google&#39;s overall workforce.&#34; She did, however, add &#34;we can&#39;t be sure of the economy in the future.&#34;</p><p>Host Kara Swisher pointed out a common term associated with Google employees working at the company for a long time called “rest and vest,” which was depicted on the six-season HBO fictional show </p><p>Smiling, Pichai said he never watched the popular show. &#34;Too close to home,” he remarked. “You watch TV to relax.&#34; </p></div></div></div>
