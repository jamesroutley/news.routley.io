    <h1>Examples Are the Best Documentation</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>When I&#39;m searching for docs, 95% of the time a single example would suffice. Yet, 95% of the time I can&#39;t find one in any official source.</p>
<p>It seems that by default formal technical documentation is targeted towards someone who&#39;s deeply immersed in the ecosystem. But many developers have to juggle a lot of &#34;worlds&#34; in their heads daily. When jumping between projects, languages and frameworks, it takes a considerable amount of mental energy to restore the context and understand what is going on.</p>
<p>Consider this <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#max">example</a> from the Python 3 docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>max(iterable, /, *, key=None)</code>
Return the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.... <em>[followed by 5 short paragraphs]</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to know quite a bit about Python in order to understand this:</p>
<ul>
<li>What <code>*</code> means in the function definition.</li>
<li>What <code>/</code> means in the function definition.</li>
<li>What&#39;s a &#34;positional-only parameter separator&#34;</li>
<li>What&#39;s an iterable.</li>
<li>What are keyword-only arguments.</li>
<li>What <code>key</code> usually means.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you have to read some text in order to understand what values you can pass and how to actually call the function.</p>
<p>Granted, these are important details that can&#39;t be omitted for brevity. But I bet a lot of developers looked at that page simply because they needed to quickly find out how to pass a custom sorting function. This example would&#39;ve quickly helped them:</p>
<pre><code><span>max</span>(<span>4</span>, <span>6</span>) 

<span>max</span>([<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>]) 

<span>max</span>([<span>&#39;x&#39;</span>, <span>&#39;y&#39;</span>, <span>&#39;abc&#39;</span>],  key=<span>len</span>) 

<span>max</span>([]) 

<span>max</span>([], default=<span>5</span>) 
</code></pre><p>Easy, right?</p>
<p>One popular community-based project in the Clojure world is <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/">clojuredocs.org</a>, a site where people contribute examples for built in functions. It&#39;s fantastic and, in my experience, indispensable in day-to-day coding. For example, check out the pages about <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/into">into</a> or <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/spit">spit</a> or <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map">map</a>. Note that examples often include related functions, not only those in question. This increases the real-world usefulness and practicality.</p>
<p>Since even major software projects rarely offer <a href="https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/">4 distinct kinds of documentation</a>, I am often hesitant to click on a &#34;Documentation&#34; link. Chances are, it&#39;s a terse, difficult to read, automatically generated API reference. I often choose to find a tutorial, not because I need a walk-through, but because I need examples.</p>
