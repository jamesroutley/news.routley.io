  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>When talking about REST, it is worth reading <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation">the dissertation</a> of Roy Thomas Fielding. The <a href="https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/fielding_dissertation.pdf">original paper</a> that describes RESTful web, “Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures” Roy T. Fielding (2000), introduces the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style as a framework for designing scalable, performant, and maintainable networked systems, particularly web services.</p>

<p>The paper aims to analyze architectural styles for network-based systems, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. It defines REST as a specific architectural style optimized for the modern web, focusing on scalability, simplicity, and adaptability.</p>

<p>Fielding demonstrates how REST principles shape the success of the web, advocating for its adoption in designing distributed systems with universal, stateless interfaces and clear resource-based interactions.</p>

<p>In his dissertation he does <strong>not</strong> prescribe the specific use of HTTP verbs (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) or focus on CRUD-style APIs as REST is often implemented today.</p>

<p>The dissertation clearly describes REST as an architectural style that provides principles and constraints for building network-based applications, using the web as its foundational example.</p>

<p>Roy Fielding has explicitly criticized the oversimplification of REST in CRUD-style APIs, emphasizing that many so-called “RESTful” APIs fail to implement key REST constraints, particularly the use of hypermedia for driving application state transitions. In his 2008 blog post, “REST APIs must be hypertext-driven,” Fielding states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If the engine of application state (and hence the API) is not being driven by hypertext, then it cannot be RESTful and cannot be a REST API. Period.” <a href="https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This underscores his view that without hypermedia controls, an API does not fulfill the REST architectural style Hypermedia controls are elements embedded in a resource representation that guide clients on what actions they can take next.</p>

<p>Common misconceptions in the context of what people consider REST are for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>REST is CRUD (often it is, but not always)</li>
  <li>A resource is an entity (often meaning a persistence entity).</li>
  <li>RESTful API must not use verbs.</li>
</ul>

<p>But those are actually <em>design decision</em> made for the API at hand, chosen by their creators and have nothing to do with REST.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-driven-by-hypertext-mean">What Does “Driven by Hypertext” Mean?</h2>

<p>The phrase “not being driven by hypertext” in Roy Fielding’s criticism refers to the absence of Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a>) in many APIs that claim to be RESTful. HATEOAS is a fundamental principle of REST, requiring that the client dynamically discover actions and interactions through hypermedia links embedded in server responses, rather than relying on out-of-band knowledge (e.g., API documentation).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;orderId&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>123</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;_links&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>&#34;self&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>&#34;href&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;/orders/123&#34;</span><span> </span><span>},</span><span>
    </span><span>&#34;cancel&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>&#34;href&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;/orders/123/cancel&#34;</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>&#34;method&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;POST&#34;</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The core problem it addresses is client-server coupling. There are probably countless projects where a small change in a server’s URI structure required a coordinated (and often painful) deployment of multiple client applications. A HATEOAS-driven approach directly solves this by decoupling the client from the server’s namespace. This addresses the quality of evolvability.</p>

<p>Simply implementing HATEOAS will bring you closer to RESTful principles than debating whether verbs are allowed in your API.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-resource">What is a “Resource”?</h2>

<p>Often people argue about what a resource in REST is. I’ve seen more or less commonly people expressing the opinion that a resource is a data structure coming from the server, unfortunately often even equal to a persistence entity.</p>

<p>Let’s check what Fielding says about it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The key abstraction of information in REST is a resource.</strong> Any information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a temporal service (e.g. “today’s weather in Los Angeles”), a collection of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In other words, any concept that might be the target of an author’s hypertext reference must fit within the definition of a resource. A resource is a conceptual mapping to a set of entities, not the entity that corresponds to the mapping at any particular point in time.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Semantics are a by-product of the act of assigning resource identifiers and populating those resources with representations. At no time whatsoever do the server or client software need to know or understand the meaning of a URI – they merely act as a conduit through which the creator of a resource (a human naming authority) can associate representations with the semantics identified by the URI. In other words, there are no resources on the server; just mechanisms that supply answers across an abstract interface defined by resources. It may seem odd, but this is the essence of what makes the Web work across so many different implementations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now let’s take a look at <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This specification does not limit the scope of what might be a
resource; rather, <strong>the term “resource”</strong> is used in a general sense
for whatever might be <strong>identified by a URI</strong>. Familiar examples
include <strong>an electronic document, an image, a source of information
with a consistent purpose</strong> (e.g., “today’s weather report for Los
Angeles”), a service (e.g., an HTTP-to-SMS gateway), and a
collection of other resources.  <strong>A resource is not necessarily
accessible via the Internet</strong>; e.g., human beings, corporations, and
bound books in a library can also be resources.  Likewise,
abstract concepts can be resources, such as the operators and
operands of a mathematical equation, the types of a relationship
(e.g., “parent” or “employee”), or numeric values (e.g., zero,
one, and infinity).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following examples of URIs are taken from the RFC as well:</p>

<h3 id="conclusion-about-resources">Conclusion about Resources</h3>

<p>A resource can be virtually anything that can be addressed by a URI. It can be a physical object, a concept, a document, a service, or even a virtual or abstract thing—as long as it can be uniquely identified and represented.</p>

<h2 id="what-fielding-considers-a-restful-api">What Fielding considers a RESTful API</h2>

<p>In 2008, Fielding expressed frustration: <a href="https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">Source</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I am getting frustrated by the number of people calling any HTTP-based interface a REST API.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fielding describes six rules that you should consider before calling your API a RESTful API <a href="https://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">Source</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>API designers, please note the following rules before calling your creation a REST API:</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A REST API should not be dependent on any single communication protocol</strong>, though its successful mapping to a given protocol may be dependent on the availability of metadata, choice of methods, etc. In general, any protocol element that uses a URI for identification must allow any URI scheme to be used for the sake of that identification. <em>[Failure here implies that identification is not separated from interaction.]</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A REST API should not contain any changes to the communication protocols aside from filling-out or fixing the details of underspecified bits of standard protocols</strong>, such as HTTP’s PATCH method or Link header field. Workarounds for broken implementations (such as those browsers stupid enough to believe that HTML defines HTTP’s method set) should be defined separately, or at least in appendices, with an expectation that the workaround will eventually be obsolete. <em>[Failure here implies that the resource interfaces are object-specific, not generic.]</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A REST API should spend almost all of its descriptive effort in defining the media type(s) used for representing resources and driving application state, or in defining extended relation names and/or hypertext-enabled mark-up for existing standard media types.</strong> Any effort spent describing what methods to use on what URIs of interest should be entirely defined within the scope of the processing rules for a media type (and, in most cases, already defined by existing media types). <em>[Failure here implies that out-of-band information is driving interaction instead of hypertext.]</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A REST API must not define fixed resource names or hierarchies (an obvious coupling of client and server).</strong> Servers must have the freedom to control their own namespace. Instead, allow servers to instruct clients on how to construct appropriate URIs, such as is done in HTML forms and URI templates, by defining those instructions within media types and link relations. [Failure here implies that clients are assuming a resource structure due to out-of band information, such as a domain-specific standard, which is the data-oriented equivalent to RPC’s functional coupling].</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A REST API should never have “typed” resources that are significant to the client.</strong> Specification authors may use resource types for describing server implementation behind the interface, but those types must be irrelevant and invisible to the client. The only types that are significant to a client are the current representation’s media type and standardized relation names. [ditto]</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI</strong> (bookmark) and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the API). From that point on, all application state transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations. The transitions may be determined (or limited by) the client’s knowledge of media types and resource communication mechanisms, both of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand). <em>[Failure here implies that out-of-band information is driving interaction instead of hypertext.]</em></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>But what does all of that exactly mean? To be honest, without spending some time and thoughts I didn’t comprehend it either the first time I was reading it.</p>

<h2 id="interpretation-of-the-rules">Interpretation of the Rules</h2>

<p>This is my understanding of them, feel free to disagree and lets have a conversation! I’m curious to learn a different point of view or opinion about them.</p>

<h3 id="1-dont-depend-on-one-protocol">1. Don’t Depend on One Protocol</h3>

<p>A REST API uses Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to name things. A URL (http://…) is just one specific type of URI that also includes a location. The key principle here is that a resource’s fundamental identity should be separate from its access mechanism.</p>

<p>A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a broad concept that refers to any string used to identify a resource, while a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a specific type of URI that not only identifies a resource but also provides a means to locate it by describing its primary access mechanism (such as its network location).</p>

<p>Your API should work with any URI and not rely on HTTP-specific mechanisms.</p>

<h3 id="2-dont-change-the-protocol">2. Don’t Change the Protocol</h3>

<p>Stick to existing standards (like HTTP). If something in the standard is vague, clarify it. Don’t invent new behaviors or break existing ones.</p>

<p>Don’t hack or redefine how HTTP works. Fix the gaps, but don’t change the rules.</p>

<p>If HTTP doesn’t fully define how PATCH should work, you can clarify it. But don’t redefine GET to also delete data just because it’s convenient.</p>

<h3 id="3-focus-on-media-types-not-uris">3. Focus on Media Types, Not URIs</h3>

<p>Your API should define how to understand and use the data it returns — through media types (like JSON, HTML) and links — not focus on the structure of URIs or what actions to call.</p>

<p>Put your energy into designing the format of the data and the links inside it, not into documenting what URLs to hit.</p>

<p>Instead of documenting that you must POST to <code>/users/123/activate</code>, your API should return a user representation in a hypermedia-aware format (like <code>application/hal+json</code> or a custom type like <code>application/vnd.myapp.user+json</code>).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;name&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;John Doe&#34;</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;status&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;inactive&#34;</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;_links&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>&#34;self&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>&#34;href&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;/users/123&#34;</span><span> </span><span>},</span><span>
    </span><span>&#34;activate&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>&#34;href&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;/users/123/activate&#34;</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>&#34;method&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;POST&#34;</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>The client code doesn’t know about the <code>/users/123/activate path.</code> It only knows that the media type defines an “activate” link relation, and it uses the href and method provided in the response to perform the action.</p>

<h3 id="4-dont-hardcode-uri-structures">4. Don’t Hardcode URI Structures</h3>

<p>This rule is the direct consequence of Rule #3. Clients shouldn’t assume or hardcode paths like <code>/users/123/posts</code>. Instead, they should discover URIs through links provided by the server. Clients should learn about URIs dynamically.</p>

<p>A client shouldn’t assume that a user’s posts are at /users/123/posts. It should read a link like this from the resource:</p>

<h3 id="5-avoid-resource-types">5. Avoid Resource “Types”</h3>

<p>The server’s internal classification of a resource (e.g., User vs. Admin) must be entirely irrelevant and invisible to the client.</p>

<p>The client shouldn’t care what kind of entity a resource represents internally (like User, Admin, Moderator). It should care only about the media type (like <code>application/json</code>) and the links/actions it sees.</p>

<p>Don’t expose internal object types or roles. Just send a well-structured response with useful links. Don’t require the client to know that a resource is of type Admin. Just give them a consistent <code>application/json</code> response with relevant links and data.</p>

<p>By “standardized relation names” he refers to the <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml">registered link relations</a> by the <a href="https://www.iana.org">IANA</a>.</p>

<h3 id="6-start-with-a-bookmark-and-follow-the-links">6. Start with a Bookmark and Follow the Links</h3>

<p>The client should only need one starting point (e.g., a base URL, a bookmark) and a knowledge of standard media types. Everything else — what to do, where to go — should come from the server responses.</p>

<p>Clients should follow links like browsing a website — starting from the home page and clicking through, not hardcoding paths.</p>

<p>Start with https://api.example.com/ and follow the _links in each response:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>&#34;_links&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>&#34;user&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>&#34;href&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;/users/123&#34;</span><span> </span><span>},</span><span>
    </span><span>&#34;orders&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span> </span><span>&#34;href&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;/users/123/orders&#34;</span><span> </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<hr/>

<p>In practice, very few APIs adhere to these principles. The next section examines why.</p>

<h2 id="why-arent-most-apis-truly-restful">Why aren’t most APIs truly RESTful?</h2>

<p>The widespread adoption of a simpler, RPC-like style over HTTP can probably attributed to practical trade-offs in tooling and developer experience: The ecosystem around specifications like OpenAPI grew rapidly, offering immediate, benefits that proved irresistible to development teams. These tools provided powerful features like automatic client/server code generation, interactive documentation, and request validation out-of-the-box. For a team under pressure to deliver, the clear, static contract provided by an OpenAPI definition was and still is probably often seen as “good enough,” making the long-term architectural benefits of HATEOAS, like evolvability, seem abstract and less urgent.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the initial cognitive overhead of building a truly hypermedia-driven client was perceived as a significant barrier. It felt easier for a developer to read documentation and hardcode a URI template like <code>/users/{id}/orders</code> than to write a client that could dynamically parse a <code>_links</code> section and discover the “orders” URI at runtime.</p>

<p>In many common scenarios, such as a front-end single-page application being developed by the same team as the back-end, the client and server are already tightly coupled. In this context, the primary problem that HATEOAS solves—decoupling the client from the server’s URI structure—doesn’t present as an immediate pain point, making the simpler, documentation-driven approach the path of least resistance.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Fielding’s rules emphasize that a truly RESTful API should embrace hypermedia (HATEOAS) as the central mechanism for interaction, not just use HTTP as a <em>transport</em>. REST is protocol-independent at its core; HTTP is simply a convenient way of using it. Clients should discover and navigate resources dynamically through links and standardized relations embedded in representations — not rely on hardcoded URI structures, types, or external documentation.</p>

<p>This makes REST systems loosely coupled, evolvable, and aligned with how the web itself operates: through <em>representation, discovery, and transitions</em>. <strong>REST isn’t about exposing your internal object model over HTTP — it’s about building distributed systems that behave like the web</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, simply be pragmatic.</strong> I personally like to avoid the term “RESTful” for the reasons given in the article and instead say “HTTP” based APIs. Build whatever makes sense for <strong>your</strong> project and the consumers of your API. Ignore the dogmatists who preach what RESTful APIs might be and what not. An API should be easy to learn and hard to misuse in the first place. If it fulfills that criteria it doesn’t matter if it is RESTful or not. Follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Postels Law</a> if it makes sense for your case: “Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.”.</p>

<p>Who is the consumer of your API? How easy will it be for it to learn and use the API? Will it be intuitive to use? What are possible constraints? How do you version it? Deprecation and sun-setting strategies? How are changes to the API effectively communicated to consumers? Those things are much more valuable than the actual format of your resource identifier.</p>

<p>By using HATEOAS and referencing schema definitions (such as XSD or JSON Schema) from within your resource representations, you can enable clients to understand the structure of the data and navigate the API dynamically. This can support generic or self-adapting clients. If that aligns with your goals (e.g., client decoupling, evolvability, dynamic interaction), then it’s a valid and powerful design choice. If you are building a public API for external developers you don’t control, invest in HATEOAS. If you are building a backend for a single frontend controlled by your own team, a simpler RPC-style API may be the more practical choice.</p>
