His family&#39;s net worth is less than $2,000. And his parents are neither supportive nor involved in his life.</p><p>When researchers assessed his home and family life, they determined he was in a fairly <span>risky environment.</span></p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div> </div>  <div><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>Over the next 25 years, researchers will continue interviewing Alex regularly. He&#39;ll be <span>bullied</span> at school. He&#39;ll be held back a few grades. He won&#39;t go to college.</p><p>As an adult, he&#39;ll often live in poverty while struggling with his physical and mental health.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div> </div>  <div><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>But, right now, Alex is a teenager. And there&#39;s only so much control he has over his life.</p><p>He thinks his teachers are pretty good. He&#39;ll soon go on his first date with a girl. And he&#39;s <span>pretty optimistic</span> about the future. In other words, he&#39;s like most other teenagers. </p><p>Let&#39;s meet everyone else.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div> </div>  <div><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>In this story, we&#39;ll follow hundreds of teenagers for the next 24 years, when they’ll be in their late-30s.</p><p>They&#39;re among the thousands of kids who are part of the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/nls/" rel="no_referrer" target="_blank">National Longitudinal Survey of Youth</a>.

For example, they asked whether the kid has basic necessities, like electricity or a quiet place to study.</p><p>They also asked about factors that could destabilize the home environment – chaotic routines, parents who have disabilities, or relatives struggling with substance abuse.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div> </div>  <div><p>And a lot of kids are growing up <span>extremely poor</span> – which, in and of itself, can be <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29563312/" rel="no_referrer" target="_blank">traumatic</a>.</p> </div>  <div><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>A year from now, in 1998, a researcher named Vincent Felitti will <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9635069/" rel="no_referrer" target="_blank">publish a paper</a> that drastically changes the way we think about these kids – and their childhood.</p><p>The research will show that these childhood stressors and traumas – called Adverse Childhood Experiences – have a lifelong effect on our health, relationships, happiness, financial security, and pretty much everything else that we value. It will kickstart decades of research that shows that our childhood experiences shape our adulthood far more than we ever thought. </p><p>While we can&#39;t track everything about these kids&#39; lives, we can track how many of the following  <span>adverse experiences</span> each kid experiences:</p><ul><li>Having uninvolved parents</li><li>Held back in school</li><li>School suspensions</li><li>Being  bullied</li><li>Seeing someone shot with a gun</li></ul><p>In addition, I&#39;ll add in the <strong>home/family environment risk score</strong> to calculate the total adverse experience number.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div> </div>  <div><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>To make this easier to see, let&#39;s split the kids up into three groups – kids who experience…</p><p> <span></span>No adverse experiences (0)</p><p>Let&#39;s go forward in time.

But psychologist Jeffrey Arnett <a href="https://jeffreyarnett.com/ARNETT_Emerging_Adulthood_theory.pdf" rel="no_referrer" target="_blank">argues</a> that, in developed countries, there is an era between ages 18 and 25  when we collectively agree to let people explore the world and figure out what role they want to have in it. He calls it &#34;emerging adulthood&#34;. And college is an environment built for emerging adults – a place where kids can leave their family environment and finally have a chance to independently shape their futures.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div> </div>  <div><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>It&#39;s 2003.</p><p>More kids will eventually go to <span>college</span> – but it&#39;ll be uncommon for kids who experienced many adverse events.</p><p>It&#39;s a cruel irony. Research has shown that even one year of college or technical school <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8428486/" rel="no_referrer" target="_blank">can mitigate</a> some of the effects of adverse childhood experiences.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div> </div>    <div><div><!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>Let&#39;s check in on Alex. </p><p>He&#39;s 20 now. The last few years were tough. He was held back in high school, graduated with a 2.9 GPA, and didn&#39;t go to college.</p><p>But he moved out of his parents&#39; house and he briefly had a job as a grounds maintenance worker.
