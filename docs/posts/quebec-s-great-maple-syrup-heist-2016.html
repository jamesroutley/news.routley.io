    <h1>Quebec’s Great Maple Syrup Heist (2016)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Americans are focused on the wrong border. It’s not Mexico, with all
this dubious talk about building a wall, but Canada, with its Mounties,
and comedy writers who move among us, betrayed only by the occasional
mispronunciation of “about,” that threatens our way of life. If this
nation was not founded on the free flow of syrup, it should have been.
And now, as anyone with kids can tell you, the price of syrup has
remained stable and high; it’s more expensive than oil. Is it Arab
sheikhs who did this, Russian oligarchs? No. It’s Canadians, who,
organized into an ironfisted cartel, have established a stranglehold on
that honey-flavored elixir.</p><p>In short, FPAQ—the Federation of Quebec Maple Syrup Producers—is
OPEC. Formed in 1966, the federation was tasked with taking a business
in which few could make a decent living—the price went north to south
with the quality of the yield, which went north to south with the
quality of the spring—and turning it into a respectable trade. This
was accomplished in the classic way: quotas, rules. You control supply,
you control price. You limit supply, you raise price. Because Quebec
makes 72 percent of the world’s maple syrup, it’s been able to set the
price. As of this writing, the commodity is valued at just over $1,300
a barrel, 26 times more expensive than crude. (If Jed Clampett shot up a
sugar maple instead of a mountain holler, he’d have been a whole
different order of rich.) I discovered this for myself on a recent trip
to the supermarket. My son returned from the shelves with a small
artisanal jug of Canadian syrup—“genuine maple” has prospered in
concert with the boom in organic food—which cost . . . $15! It
shocked me. I stormed up the aisle to see for myself, where I discovered
Aunt Jemima, companion of so many Sunday mornings, in her babushka,
costing just four bucks for a family-size jug. When I asked the cashier
to explain this discrepancy, she pointed rudely at Aunt Jemima and said,
“ ‘Cause that’s not real syrup.”</p><p>“Then what is it?”</p><p>“I don’t know. High-fructose corn syrup? Food coloring? Goo?”</p><p>It’s an answer that would bring joy in Quebec—authenticity is what
FPAQ is selling. Canadian maple is real, while all those high-fructose
Jemimas are as phony as the bottle that is the body of Mrs. Butterworth.
In a world covered in plastic and going to hell, there’s nothing more
honest than sap. In Canada, people tell you the trappers got it from the
Indians, who got it from their ancestors, who got it from the gods. It’s
the death and rebirth of the forest turned into wine. If consumers know
that, it’s partly because of FPAQ, which has turned Quebec into a brand.</p><p>Have there been side effects to all this success? Has the federation,
with its quotas and its methods of control (quotas must be enforced),
reaped its own sticky harvest?</p><p>Start with those high prices. By making syrup production seem like a
good business instead of just an eccentric survivalist hobby, it has
brought a great increase in production, much of it in the U.S. Just like
OPEC, which, with its near monopoly, spurred the search for new sources.
With oil, it’s the deep deposits reached only by fracking. With syrup,
it’s forests in Vermont, New Hampshire, and especially New York State,
which, Canadians tell you with a shudder, has three times more maple
trees than all of Quebec’s maple farms combined. The French province
produces 72 percent of the world supply, but if the Americans ever make
the push to self-sufficiency, French Canada is cooked. In 2015, Quebec’s
minister of agriculture, Pierre Paradis, commissioned a report on FPAQ
and the industry—just how far could that 72 percent fall? While giving
proper credit to the cartel, the report, noting, among other things, how
readily journalists like me compare FPAQ to OPEC, called on the
federation to loosen its rules, scrap its quotas, and let a thousand
flowers bloom. “It’s a mafia,” a producer who has defied the cartel
recently said to <em>The Globe and Mail</em> of FPAQ. “Last year, they tried to
seize my syrup. I had to [move the product into New Brunswick] at
night. This year, they hit me with an injunction.”</p><p>And what about that most troubling of unintended consequences: the black
market, the subterranean world of contraband sap where wildcatters move
unmarked barrels through Elmore Leonard country, the seedy history
behind your stack of morning hotcakes or pancakes, or, as they insisted
everywhere I went, crêpes. Especially interesting are the criminals,
pirates of syrup nation, who, attracted by the peak prices, skulk
through warehouses, waiting for the watchman to doze off over his <em>Hockey
News</em> as the getaway truck idles.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><p>Barrels of maple syrup at the Global Strategic Maple Syrup Reserve, in Laurierville, Quebec.</p>

Jemima. The original character was borrowed from a minstrel show that
was touring the South at the end of the 19th century. The original
Jemima was a white man in black face, possibly a German. The character
was re-purposed in the 1890s by an American mill owner who sold pancake
mix with an Aunt Jemima who, though smiling beneath her headscarf, looks
nothing like the Aunt Jemima of my childhood. In 1893, marketers hired
Nancy Green, who’d been a slave in Kentucky, to play Aunt Jemima, which
she did till her death, in 1923. By the 1930s, General Mills, which had
bought the company, had begun to churn through Aunt Jemimas, printing up
frankly offensive catchphrases such as “Let ol’ Auntie sing in yo’
kitchen.” The Aunt Jemima on the label today is a composite, a dream of
antebellum domesticity, the bosomy warmth of Sunday in Dixieland, where
Jim calls Huck “honey” as they float down the big river. Why does that
trademark still exist? Probably because no group has yet turned its
attention to it: #jemimasoracist. Enjoy your view from the Stop &amp; Shop
shelf, Aunt Jemima, your days are numbered.</p><p>Which is what I was thinking about as I drove across Canada, en route to
perhaps the holiest place in syrup. America has its Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. In case of embargo, nukes, Mad Max. Canada has a Global
Strategic Maple Syrup Reserve. In case of Butterworth, Jemima, who knows
what. Jemima stands for everything Canadians distrust about the planet
and the syrup much of it consumes.</p><p>It’s one of the things FPAQ was organized to battle. Phony syrup and its
lies, fake backstories cooked up for Aunt Jemima and her pal,
Mrs. Butterworth. Caroline Cyr, a spokesperson for the
federation—perfect name for a syrup lady—seemed especially irritated
by varieties of what is essentially high-fructose corn syrup, products
that often decorate their labels with maple trees and log cabins,
implying a connection to the forest that simply does not exist. FPAQ
fights with advertising and fancy recipes—Crustless Vegetable Quiche
with Maple Syrup, Crêpes with Kale and Maple Syrup, Maple-Almond
Truffles—but mostly by controlling the quality and quantity of the
product.</p><p>Hence the Reserve.</p><h2>Barrel In</h2><p>Here’s how it works: there are 13,500 maple-syrup producers in Quebec.
Each is permitted to send a fixed amount to FPAQ for sale that year, a
quota that was established in 2004, even as U.S. production has exploded
(up 27 percent from 2015). Members of the federation—Quebec’s bulk
producers are required to join—give their harvest over to FPAQ, which
inspects, tastes, and grades the syrup. Some of it is sold immediately;
the rest is stored in the Reserve. Producers are paid only when the
syrup is sold, which can mean years. FPAQ keeps $54 for each barrel, a
kind of tax that pays for the advertising, the testing of the recipes,
the upkeep of the Reserve, and so on. In this way, the federation
steadies supply, filling the coffers in banner years, satisfying demand
in fallow. In this way, the price of syrup is stabilized, benefiting
even the competitors across the border.</p><p>The Reserve is in Laurierville, a town in the heart of Quebec. Steeples,
snowy roads, hills, old men in berets eating croissants at McDonald’s.
It’s reached via spotless highways where no one tailgates or cuts you
off or honks in anger. It’s just the polite double beep in Quebec, a
state of play that seems connected to how most syrup producers have been
content to leave the free market for the safety of a cartel. It’s a
better life, with less road rage, but also not as colorful, nor as
interesting, and forget about the windfall and resulting spree.</p><p>Caroline Cyr met me at the back door of the Reserve and took me on a
tour. As I said, it’s the holy of holies, where oceans of syrup, the
accumulated wealth of Canadian forests, hibernates, sometimes for
months, sometimes for years. I had a clear mental picture of the
Reserve: huge vats, surface crusted and covered with flies; tanks
reached by tottering ziggurats; visitors in perpetual danger of falling
in and doing the slowest, stickiest, sweetest dead man’s float of all
time. In fact, the Reserve, which might hold 7.5 million gallons on a
typical day, is a warehouse filled with barrels, white drums stacked
from floor to ceiling, nearly 20 feet high. There was a Charles
Sheeler-like quality to the place, an industrial awesomeness, the
barrels in endless rows, the implied weight of them, persnickety and
precise in a way that seems especially Canadian. It’s almost like the
life we know, but not quite. It’s so close, yet so different. A treasure
trove, with inventory, at any given time, worth perhaps $185 million.
The syrup is tested when it comes in, then sent through a Willie
Wonka-esque conveyor system where it’s pasteurized and sealed in a
barrel, forklifted and stacked. Each barrel carries a label with a grade
(Extra Light, Light, Medium, Amber, Dark) and percentage. When maple
water exits a maple tree, it’s 2 to 4 percent sugar. As it’s boiled, the
sugar concentrates. To be syrup, it must be 66 percent sugar. Below
that, it’s not stable. Above 69 percent, it turns into something else.
Butter. Taffy. Candy. There were two or three guys cruising around on
forklifts, in hairnets. “We’re all waiting for the spring,” Cyr told
me, “when this place will be filled with barrels.” Being in syrup is
like being a tax accountant. Three or four weeks of intensity followed
by months of waiting and wondering.</p><p>I asked Cyr if there’d ever been a spill. She looked at me like I was a
fool. I told her about a molasses spill that had once smothered Boston’s
North End, a wave that upended trees, drove horses mad, and killed 21.
“No,” she said calmly. “We have never had a spill.”</p><p>The Reserve is a monument to collective planning, to thousands of little
guys each giving up a little freedom in return for security. Canadians
call this a better life. Americans call it socialism. Austrian economist
Friedrich Hayek might call it “the Road to Serfdom.” It’s like all the
other roads in Quebec. Calm and predictable, without a single Camaro
blasting Bon Jovi, or a sticker of a cartoon man flipping you off while
peeing. But it’s had the perverse effect of pooling wealth, of creating
just the sort of target Willie Sutton meant when he supposedly said he
robs banks because that’s where the money is. Cyr encouraged me to lift
one of the barrels. I couldn’t budge it. Imagine trying to steal one of
those barrels—now imagine trying to steal 10,000.</p><div data-testid="GenericCallout"><figure><p><span><p>Entrepreneur and syrup producer François Roberge at his sugar shack, in Lac-Brome, Quebec.</p>

one of those July days when the first hint of autumn cools the northern
forest, Michel Gauvreau began his precarious climb up the barrels in
St.-Louis-de-Blandford, a town outside Laurierville, where part of the
Reserve was stored in a rented warehouse. Once a year, FPAQ takes an
inventory of the barrels. Gauvreau was near the top of the stack when
one of the barrels teetered, then nearly gave way. “He almost fell,”
Cyr said, pausing to let the picture form. A small man, astride a tower
of syrup, realizing, suddenly, there’s nothing beneath his feet.
Normally, weighing more than 600 pounds when filled, the barrels are
sturdy, so something was clearly amiss. When Gauvreau knocked on the
barrel, it tolled like a gong. When he unscrewed the cap, he discovered
it empty. At first, it seemed like this might have been a glitch, a
mistake, but soon more punk barrels were found—many more. Even barrels
that seemed full had been emptied of syrup and filled with water—a
sure sign of thieves who’d covered their tracks. My God, they could be
in Thunder Bay by now! In most cases, when a boring, bureaucratic job
turns interesting, there’s trouble.</p><p>Inspectors called FPAQ HQ and sounded the alarm. Just like that, the
facility was swarming with cops. It was a great mystery. There were no
security cameras. Who would steal syrup? And, even if some sick bastard
wanted to, what would he carry it away in? How far could he get?</p><p>The investigation was headed by the Sûreté du Québec police, which was
soon joined by the Royal Mounties and U.S. Customs. They promised to
spare no expense. These heartless criminals would be brought to justice,
and the syrup, described as “hot,” would be recovered. About 300
people were questioned, 40 search warrants executed. It was not O.J. and
the knife. It was not the bearded doctor and one-armed man. But it was
special, strange. There was something stirring about making off with all
that syrup; it boggled the mind. It felt less like a crime than a prank,
what you might do to your brother if you were all-powerful and he had a
lot of syrup. Of course it was serious business to FPAQ; nearly 540,000
gallons of syrup had been stolen—12.5 percent of the Reserve—with a
street value of $13.4 million. It became known as the Great Maple Syrup
Heist and was said to be among the most fantastic agricultural crimes
ever committed, which, granted, is an odd subset. Everyone figured it
was people who’d done it—Martians don’t love syrup—but no one could
figure out how. “Try to think up the scenario and it’s impossible,” a
friendly hotel waiter told me in Montreal. “Syrup is heavy. And sticky.
How do you hide it? Who do you get to smuggle it? Where can you sell it?
It’s like stealing the salt out of the sea.”</p><p>It was most likely an inside job. Not a member of FPAQ—though rogue
syrup producers have their theories—nor a manufacturer, but a tenant
who happened to be renting space in the same facility. That would mean
access: keys, ID card, reason to be there. FPAQ supplied the motive. The
value of the commodity, the tight control of supply, the resulting black
market. (In the post-apocalyptic world, as Mad Max runs the gauntlet for
petrol, Canucks will be fighting over those last precious drops of
genuine maple.) Several conspirators were pursued, including alleged
ringleaders Avik Caron and Richard Vallières. Working with a handful of
others, some with knowledge of the trade, they apparently went after the
bounty like Mickey in the Night Kitchen, dreaming their dream between
midnight and dawn, when the world is half realized, insubstantial.
According to the prosecutor, the gang would truck barrels out of the
Reserve to a sugar shack where they would siphon the syrup in the way
you siphon gasoline from a semi, feeding it, a cask at a time, into
their own ramshackle barrels and then re-filling the originals with
water. As the operation grew, the masterminds allegedly brought on
accomplices and began siphoning the syrup directly from barrels in the
Reserve. Nearly 10,000 barrels of syrup were stolen and trucked to
points south and east, where the market is free. So far, prosecutors
have brought four men to trial.</p></div></div></div></div>
