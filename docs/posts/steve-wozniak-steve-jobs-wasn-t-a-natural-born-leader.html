    <h1>Steve Wozniak: Steve Jobs wasn’t a natural-born leader</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="MakeItRegularArticle-ArticleBody-5" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-1" data-analytics="MakeItRegularArticle-articleBody-5-1"><div><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/06/steve-wozniak-on-steve-jobs-personality-shift-as-apple-co-founder.html">Steve Wozniak</a> knows the importance of communication, especially when building a business. After all, he co-founded Apple with one of the tech world&#39;s greatest communicators and marketers of all time: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/12/3-tricks-steve-jobs-used-that-can-help-you-be-a-better-public-speaker.html">Steve Jobs</a>.</p><p>The late Jobs has long been heralded as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/bill-gates-i-was-so-jealous-of-genius-steve-jobs.html">a &#34;genius&#34;</a> for the way he marketed and sold Apple products, most of which were designed and built by Wozniak in the company&#39;s early days. But Wozniak tells <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it/">CNBC Make It</a> that his partner wasn&#39;t always a marketing and communications guru – those were skills Jobs had to develop to compensate for not being a particularly skilled computer engineer.</p><p>&#34;He learned a lot of marketing principles because he wasn&#39;t really capable, engineering wise, you know, computer hardware [and] software,&#34; Wozniak says of Jobs. &#34;He had to find other areas to make himself important.&#34;</p><p>Last year, Wozniak began starring on the online reality show &#34;<a href="https://unicornhunters.com/" target="_blank">Unicorn Hunters</a>,&#34; alongside <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/12/maya-angelou-quarter-rosie-rios-on-championing-historical-women.html">former U.S. Treasurer Rosie Rios</a> and singer Lance Bass, among others. On the show, he and the other judges field investment pitches from tech start-up founders, and Wozniak says he&#39;s sometimes &#34;amazed&#34; at how ineffectively some entrepreneurs communicate.</p><p>&#34;We watched a lot of pitches that were kind of rough and stuttering, and they&#39;d kind of lose themselves, and that doesn&#39;t help when you&#39;re pitching to investors,&#34; he says.</p></div><div><p>Of course, Wozniak may have been spoiled after spending years working with Jobs. Last year, Wozniak <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/06/steve-wozniak-on-steve-jobs-personality-shift-as-apple-co-founder.html">noted</a> that when the two men founded Apple, Jobs&#39; &#34;personality changed&#34; from fun-loving friend to someone who was dead serious about building a world-changing company. A crucial part of that transformation, Wozniak now says, was watching Jobs &#34;develop his communication [skills].&#34;</p><p>&#34;Being the main communicator and main business decider of things. He was very good at [that],&#34; Wozniak says.</p><p>Wozniak says Jobs&#39; skills as a communicator and salesperson helped Apple successfully market products like the iPhone as user-friendly. The smartphone was something applicable to Jobs&#39; life, Wozniak says: &#34;An understandable technology product in your hand that the Average Joe wouldn&#39;t get confused by. You didn&#39;t have to know technology [to use it].&#34;</p><p>That skill ended up separating Jobs from the rest of his generation of tech icons. In a 2020 interview, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/bill-gates-i-was-so-jealous-of-genius-steve-jobs.html">Bill Gates said he was &#34;so jealous&#34;</a> of Jobs for coming across as such a natural public speaker. Gates called Jobs &#34;a genius,&#34; particularly for the way he could inspire people – from customers to his own employees.</p><p>It was likely necessary that Jobs inspired his employees to do great things, because he was a notoriously difficult, and demanding, boss to work for. Former Apple employee <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/01/former-apple-employee-guy-kawasaki-once-stood-up-to-steve-jobs-here-is-the-amazing-response-he-received.html">Guy Kawasaki wrote in 2019</a> that working for Jobs &#34;was sometimes unpleasant and always scary, but it drove many of us to do the finest work of our careers.&#34;</p><p>And according to Wozniak, Jobs&#39; wasn&#39;t a natural communicator. In 2020, Wozniak told &#34;Guy Kawasaki&#39;s Remarkable People&#34; podcast that Jobs&#39; intense, relentless drive to become a successful communicator and leader came from his desire to ultimately be remembered as an important historical figure — and that motivation drove him to develop the appropriate skills for it.</p><p>&#34;Sometimes motivation, wanting something, is a lot more important than having the real skill,&#34; Wozniak said.</p><p><em><strong>Sign up now: </strong></em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/make-it-newsletters/"><em><strong>Get smarter about your money and career with our weekly newsletter</strong></em></a></p><p><em><strong>Don&#39;t miss:</strong></em></p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/06/steve-wozniak-on-steve-jobs-personality-shift-as-apple-co-founder.html"><em><strong>Steve Wozniak: When Apple got &#39;big money&#39; Steve Jobs&#39; personality &#39;changed&#39;</strong></em></a></p><p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/bill-gates-i-was-so-jealous-of-genius-steve-jobs.html"><em><strong>Bill Gates: &#39;I was so jealous&#39; of &#39;genius&#39; Steve Jobs</strong></em></a></p></div></div></div>
