    <h1>The Windows 98 taskbar, now on macOS</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>Are you a macOS user? Do you enjoy the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bad_design_-_Apple_Magic_Mouse_2,_unusable_when_charging_3.jpg">elegant user experience</a>? And yet, do you ever stare at your empty desktop in the morning, and think… wow, I wish I just had a little bit more inspiration? A little bit more motivation? A bit more enthusiasm?</p><p>Do you find yourself thinking…</p><blockquote><p>I just wish I knew where to <strong><em>Start</em></strong>?</p></blockquote><p>Introducing: The Windows 98 Taskbar, now available for macOS.</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/win98-taskbar-macos/on-lockscreen_hu15994258702985015369.png,

It does have a working clock! That’s pretty neat.</p><h2 id="a-working-clock-in-a-wallpaper">A working clock in a wallpaper?</h2><p>Yes! macOS has had a feature called ‘<a href="https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Dynamic_desktop">dynamic wallpapers</a>’ since 2018. They’re typically set up to use different images in dark mode or light mode, or to use different photos based on the position of the sun throughout the day. ☀️</p><p>But! They also support “time-based” wallpapers, where the picture changes based on the amount of time that’s passed since midnight. So, all we have to do is create the same image, with all possible clocks (24 × 60 = 1440 combinations), and then cram them into a single wallpaper image.</p><p>We’re really pushing the limits of what’s possible with wallpaper technology!</p><h2 id="download-and-install-instructions">Download and install instructions</h2><p>First, download the wallpaper:</p><p>Then:</p><ul><li>Open <strong>System Settings</strong> → <strong>Wallpaper</strong></li><li>Choose a <em>different</em> dynamic wallpaper, e.g. “Big Sur”, or “The Beach” or “The Desert”:<figure><img src="https://capnfabs.net/posts/win98-taskbar-macos/wallpaper-changes-throughout-day.png" alt="It needs to say “This wallpaper changes throughout the day”"/><figcaption><p>It needs to say “This wallpaper changes throughout the day”</p></figcaption></figure></li><li>Now <em>close the wallpaper settings</em></li><li>And finally, right click the wallpaper you downloaded and click “Set Desktop Picture”.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li></ul><p>It’s maximally absurd (and therefore maximally funny) if you also change some of the lock screen settings to hide the more obvious macOS UI:</p><figure><img srcset="/posts/win98-taskbar-macos/lockscreen-settings-annotated_hu13764372282324807997.png,

It takes about 2½ minutes to load the image in the Wallpaper Panel on my Macbook Air, for the smallest resolution one. Some of the bigger resolution ones never load. So… just be patient 😇</p><figure><video muted="" autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="" src="./fan-sound.mp4" alt="Watching Activity monitor while trying to load this wallpaper in the system settings" width="588"></video><figcaption><p>It’ll stay like this for about 2½ minutes; it’s trying to update the preview in the top left.</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id="future-work">Future work</h2><p>The obvious next step is to make a similar wallpaper for Windows XP. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bliss_(photograph)"><code>Bliss.jpg</code></a> with the Windows XP taskbar would be brilliant.</p><h2 id="code-etc">Code etc</h2><p>There’s code and instructions for replicating this yourself <a href="https://github.com/capnfabs/age-of-glory">on Github</a>.</p><p>Have fun! ✨</p></div></div>
