    <h1>EU reaches deal to make USB-C a common charger for most electronic devices</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Europe has <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220603IPR32196/deal-on-common-charger-reducing-hassle-for-consumers-and-curbing-e-waste" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0">reached a deal</a> to make USB-C a common charger for all phones and electronic devices, with the aim to reduce e-waste and inconvenience with incompatible chargers. &#34;Under the new rules, consumers will no longer need a different charging device and cable every time they purchase a new device, and can use one single charger for all of their small and medium-sized portable electronic devices,&#34; the European Parliament said in a press release.¬†</p>
<p>Buyers will also be able to choose whether they want to purchase new electronic equipment with or without a charger. &#34;These new obligations will lead to more re-use of chargers and will help consumers save up to 250 million euro a year on unnecessary charger purchases,&#34; the EU wrote.¬†</p>
<p>Manufacturers have until autumn 2024 to implement the new rule, which covers &#34;mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, earbuds, digital cameras, headphones and headsets, handheld videogame consoles and portable speakers.&#34; They&#39;ll have a bit longer to adapt the rule for laptops, up to 40 months after the rule goes into effect.¬†</p>
<div id="f374c70c112043d4b4b57b8c2f99a27d"><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have reached a deal on the common charger! üîåüëè</p>‚Äî IMCO Committee Press (@EP_SingleMarket) <a href="https://twitter.com/EP_SingleMarket/status/1534107035612094464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0">June 7, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p>The EU has worked with the industry to reduce the number of mobile phone chargers from 30 to 3 over the last decade, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-proposes-usb-c-as-a-common-charger-for-electronic-devices-131605815.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">said last year.</a> The biggest odd one out is Apple&#39;s Lightning iPhone port that&#39;s used by around 20 percent of devices sold in Europe. Apple has yet to respond to the legislation, but in 2020, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-23-apple-rejects-eu-call-for-common-phone-charger.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">said</a> that the push for a universal phone charger would &#34;stifle innovation.&#34;¬†</p>
<p>Another issue that&#39;s not completely clear is how the EU wants manufacturers to handle different standards like DisplayPort for video. As for power delivery (PD), the EU simply said that &#34;consumers will be provided with clear information on the charging characteristics of new devices, making it easier for them to see whether their existing chargers are compatible.&#34; USB-C version 2.1 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/usb-c-upgrade-power-104536539.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0">supports up to 240 watts</a> of power delivery, up from 100 watts, but there&#39;s no clear way to identify how much power a given cable can support.¬†</p>
<p>The EU throws away 12,000 tons of chargers each year, many unused, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/iphones-may-need-redesign-as-eu-pushes-for-common-charger" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:affiliate_link;itc:0"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. At the same time, consumers spend around 2.4 billion euros ($2.8 billion) on standalone chargers not included with devices. The new rules require formal approval the EU&#39;s Parliament and Council, which won&#39;t take place until after the summer recess. It&#39;ll enter into force 20 days after it&#39;s published in the EU Official Journal.¬†</p></div><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
