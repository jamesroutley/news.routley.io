    <h1>Deepest fish ever caught on camera off Japan</h1>

This discovery therefore beats the depth record by 158m.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;If this record is broken, it would only be by minute increments, potentially by just a few meters,&#34; Prof Alan Jamieson told BBC News.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The University of Western Australia deep-sea scientist made a prediction 10 years ago that fish would likely be found as deep as 8,200m to 8,400m. A decade of investigations around the globe has confirmed this.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>FIVEDEEPS.COM</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Prof Jamieson has pioneered the use of instrumented deep-ocean landers</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The juvenile <i>Pseudoliparis </i>was filmed by a camera system attached to a weighted frame released from over the side of a ship, the DSSV Pressure Drop. Bait was added to the frame to attract sea life.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Although a specimen was not caught to fully identify its species type, several fish were trapped slightly higher up in the water column in the nearby Japan Trench at a depth of 8,022m.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>These, again, were snailfish, <i>Pseudoliparis belyaevi</i>, and set a record for the deepest fish ever caught.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Deepest ever catch: Some snailfish were pulled up from 8,022m</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Snailfish are truly remarkable. There are over 300 species, most of which are actually shallow-water creatures and can be found in river estuaries. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But the snailfish group have also adapted to life in the cold waters of the Arctic and Antarctic, and also under the extreme pressure conditions that exist in the world&#39;s deepest trenches. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At 8km down, they are experiencing more than 80 megapascals, or 800 times the pressure at the ocean surface.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Their gelatinous bodies help them survive.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Not having a swim bladder, the gas-filled organ to control buoyancy that is found in many other fish, is an additional advantage. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Likewise, their approach to food - they are suction feeders and consume tiny crustaceans, of which there are many in trenches. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>FIVEDEEPS.COM</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The DSSV Pressure Drop is now owned by Inkfish and has been renamed Dagon</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prof Jamieson says the discovery of a fish deeper than those found in the Mariana Trench is probably due to the Izu-Ogasawara&#39;s slightly warmer waters. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We predicted the deepest fish would be there and we predicted it would be a snailfish,&#34; he said. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I get frustrated when people tell me we know nothing about the deep sea. We do. Things are changing really fast.&#34;</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prof Jamieson is the founder of the Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre. On this expedition, which also explored the Ryukyu Trenche, he worked with a team from the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Minderoo-UWA Deep Sea Research Centre</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Landers use bait to draw fish into the view of cameras</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The DSSV Pressure Drop and its crew-capable submarine, Limiting Factor, were used by the American adventurer Victor Vescovo in 2018 and 2019 to visit the deepest parts of Earth&#39;s five major oceans. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The Texan became the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-49636756">first person in history to complete the quintet of dives</a>, and Prof Jamieson acted as his chief scientist.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The ship and the submarine were sold last year to the marine research organisation Inkfish and sent for a refit in San Diego.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They have also been renamed - the ship is now Dagon and the submarine is Bakunawa - and will head back out to sea again in June with Prof Jamieson again acting as the chief scientist. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Prof Jamieson, who was born in Scotland, is credited with discovering not just the deepest fish in our oceans but also the deepest octopus,  jellyfish and squid.</p></div></article></main></div></div>
