    <h1>MSCHF’s &#39;Tax Heaven 3000&#39; Is a Dating Simulator That Also Files Your Taxes</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With Tax Day (April 18) right around the corner, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/mschf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:MSCHF;elm:context_link;itc:0">MSCHF</a> has now unveiled <em>Tax Heaven 3000</em>. For its latest irreverent release, the art collective based in Brooklyn, New York has put together a free dating simulator that also files your income taxes. MSCHF writes, &#34;Do Your Federal Taxes While Romancing Your Waifu! <em>Tax Heaven 3000</em> is a one-of-a-kind dating sim experience that really does your federal taxes!&#34;</p><p>Suitable for singles without dependents, <em>Tax Heaven 3000</em> covers the 2022 1040: U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, checking eligibility for the Earned Income Tax Credit, American Opportunity Credit, and more, with &#34;multiple endings.&#34;</p><p>The game&#39;s description arrives from the point of view of your waifu, Iris, &#34;Hi there! Iris here~ It’s always been a dream of mine to meet that special someone…and file their tax return. Join me and we’ll search for deductions while searching for love! But be careful! We’re not alone. Corporate tax filing services like TurboTax are (by dint of extensive lobbying) predatory, parasitic bottlenecks that deliberately complicate the tax filing process in order to make it unnavigable by ordinary people. They feed us their poison so that we buy their medicine!&#34;</p><p>In <em>Tax Heaven 3000</em>, Gamers/tax filers play as Turbo, &#34;An unsavory SaaS bro, quick to anger and oddly fixated on Iris. He seems to be up to no good...&#34; The character is described as liking corporate lobbying, confusing forms, dark UX, and fleece vests.</p><p>MSCHF also warns &#34;if you prepare your taxes in the game, you prepare your taxes in real life,&#34; and it is important to note the game does not cover state taxes.</p><p><em>Tax Heaven 3000</em> will be available for free April 4 on <a href="https://taxheaven3000.itch.io/tax-heaven-3000" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:itch.io;elm:context_link;itc:0">itch.io</a> for Mac and Windows users, but a $90 USD Collector&#39;s Edition of <em>Tax Heaven 3000</em> will also be available on the dedicated <a href="https://taxheaven3000.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:website;elm:context_link;itc:0">website</a> for the game. The Collector&#39;s Edition features a software box with an installation disk and case, instruction manual, and an Iris Body Pillow.</p><p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2023/3/lego-2k-drive-racing-game-leak-info" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:upcoming Lego 2K Drive racing game leaks;elm:context_link;itc:0">upcoming <em>Lego 2K Drive</em> racing game leaks</a>.</p></div></div>
