    <h1>Owen Le Blanc: creator of the first Linux distribution</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Ask a Linux enthusiast who created the Linux kernel, and odds are they will have
no trouble naming Linus Torvalds—but many would be stumped if asked what the
first Linux distribution was, and who created it. Some might guess <a href="http://www.slackware.com/">Slackware</a>, or its predecessor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softlanding_Linux_System">Softlanding Linux
System</a> (SLS); both were arguably more influential but arrived just a bit
later. The first honest-to-goodness distribution with a proper installer was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCC_Interim_Linux">MCC Interim Linux</a>,
created by Owen Le Blanc, released publicly in early 1992. I recently
reached out to Le Blanc to learn more about his work on the distribution, what
he has been doing since, and his thoughts on Linux in 2025.</p>

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1018060/"><img src="https://static.lwn.net/images/2025/owen-le-blanc-sm.png" alt="[Owen Le Blanc]" title="Owen Le Blanc"/></a></p><p>When Torvalds first released the Linux kernel, he also provided &#34;boot&#34; and &#34;root&#34;
disk images (intended for <span>5¼-inch</span> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk">floppy disks</a>) to help users
create a Linux system. There was not a proper installer, and users had to collect
several other utilities to pull together a working system. This was not, even for the
time, <a href="https://www.kclug.org/old_archives/linux-activists/1992/mar/4/0057.shtml">particularly
user friendly</a>. Clearly, Linux was going to need a little extra help on its path
to world domination.</p>

<h4>MCC Interim Linux</h4>

<p>Le Blanc worked for the Manchester Computing Centre (MCC) at the <a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a> from 1985
through 2016. He had been working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_7600">CDC 7600</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_Cyber">Cyber 170/730</a> machines, and
eventually began working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_9000">HP 9000</a> workstations. Those ran
Hewlett Packard&#39;s Unix, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX">HP-UX</a>, which
made him want to learn more about Unix. He started with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix">Xenix</a>, but wanted something easier to
use. He said that he also tried <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minix">MINIX</a>, but it was difficult to get
working on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I486">Intel 80486 CPU</a>. When
Torvalds announced Linux, Le Blanc decided to give it a try, and that too was a
fair amount of work.</p>

<blockquote>
It was fairly hard to install Linux at first, because I think you
needed both MS-DOS and Minix -- we used a bootloader from Minix before
Werner Almesberger wrote LILO. You needed Minix because the DOS fdisk
program could not write partitions for other operating systems, and
you needed DOS if you wanted to do networking.
</blockquote>

<p>He was interested in improving the installation and created a Linux
system that could be installed from a pair of floppy disks. He made
use of ramdisk code by Ted Ts&#39;o, took binaries from a <a href="https://www.kclug.org/old_archives/linux-activists/1992/sep/3/0341.shtml">proto-distribution</a>
created by H. J. Lu, and he wrote the original Linux fdisk
&#34;<q>bugs and all</q>&#34; for the project. According to the <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/historic-linux/distributions/MCC-1.0/1.0/documentation/README">MCC
README</a> for version 0.99.p10+, Le Blanc used his
distribution to install Linux on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386#80386SX">386-SX</a> machines
for the university&#39;s C and Unix courses. It was possible to install
Linux on 12 machines in about an hour, according to the
documentation, certainly an improvement over earlier installation
methods. Eventually, he asked his department if he could share the
work that he had been doing.</p>

<blockquote>
The department was reluctantly willing, provided (1) I gave them some
credit for supporting its development, and (2) I made certain they had
no responsibility for ongoing support for users.  We agreed that
calling it &#34;MCC Interim Linux&#34; suggested that MCC had developed it,
and it was not intended to be a long term project.
</blockquote>

<p>The first MCC Interim Linux release (0.12) from February 1992, is,
if not completely lost, certainly hard to find online. The <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/historic-linux/distributions/MCC-1.0/1.0/">1.0
release</a> is preserved on the ibiblio archive with other <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org/pub/historic-linux/distributions/">historic
distributions</a> such as Yggdrasil, Red Hat&#39;s &#34;Mother&#39;s Day&#34; 1.0
release, and SLS 1.03 and 1.05.</p>

<p>The distribution
included things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">GCC</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html">GNU Awk</a>, 
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs</a>, and the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Info_%28Unix%29">info</a>
packages because they were used in the university&#39;s courses. He did
not attempt to include a wide assortment of other software, such as
<a href="https://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> (then X386), though.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>Later releases can be found on <a href="https://debian.mcc.ac.uk/non-debian/mcc-interim/old/">debian.mcc.ac.uk</a>,
in the <tt>non-debian</tt> directory. It has several releases, up to
the final <a href="https://debian.mcc.ac.uk/non-debian/mcc-interim/2.0+/">2.0
release</a> from 1996. I had asked Le Blanc whether MCC had
been distributed commercially, and he said no one had ever sold copies
of MCC that he was aware of though &#34;<q>there were certainly people who
passed disks to others</q>&#34;. While doing some digging, though, I found
that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut_Creek_CDROM">Walnut
Creek</a> had included MCC in some of its Linux Toolkit CD sets. For
example, the Internet Archive has the <a href="https://archive.org/details/linux-toolkit-march-1997">March 1997</a>
set with MCC Interim Linux 1.0+, along with Slackware, Debian,
MkLinux, and others. Readers who have older Linux Toolkit CD sets, or similar
sets, gathering dust in their closets may have even earlier versions.</p>

<p>In all, Le Blanc said that the
project ran about seven years, with the last updates to the
distribution being released in early 1998. During the time MCC
was maintained, he said that he had received advice and suggestions
from many people, including Torvalds, Ts&#39;o, Almesberger, Alan Cox, as
well as local users &#34;<q>especially John Heaton, Ted Harding and Nobby
Clark</q>&#34;.</p>

<blockquote>
The most valuable help was testing, which we tried to do before every release and
update. In the early days I hoped I could find other people to develop add-ons to
the system, but this never took off.
</blockquote>

<p>There is also some misinformation about MCC&#39;s development, he said, including
claims that it was developed by Bruce Perens. &#34;<q>Bruce did terrific work on Debian
and in many other ways, but he never had a connection with MCC Linux to my
knowledge</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Le Blanc said that he used Debian from its early days, and eventually decided
to encourage others to migrate to it as well. MCC Interim Linux included a migration
tool for moving to Debian in its final release.</p>

<h4>Supporting Linux</h4>

<p>With other more ambitious and polished Linux distributions
available, Le Blanc focused his attention on managing university
servers and supporting Linux applications for <span>MCC—later</span> <a href="https://www.manchester.edu/about-manchester/office-directory/information-technology-services/its-home">Information Technology Services</a>
<span>(ITS)—users</span>. All of the servers ran
Debian, and he encouraged users to run Ubuntu—which he prefers
for desktops as well. He also supported Scientific Linux for the
computer science and mathematics department, but said that became harder and harder
to sustain because it was &#34;<q>always a bit behind for those who wanted
the latest versions of things</q>&#34;. He also continued to promote Linux
and said that he is still involved in open-source projects, such as <a href="https://lilypond.org/">LilyPond</a>, today &#34;<q>but more as a
user and support person than as a developer</q>&#34;.</p>

<p>Despite being the home of the first Linux distribution, Le Blanc said, 
the University of Manchester was always a bit reluctant to use open-source software
and he found himself &#34;<q>spending more and more energy to defend what we had</q>&#34;. He
said that there is still too much reluctance in universities, governments, and
businesses to use free and open-source software or anything that doesn&#39;t come with a
price tag. (LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/1013776/">covered</a> some of
hurdles for open-source adoption in Mexican government in March.)</p>

<blockquote>
This despite the fact that much of the commercial support for &#34;industry standard&#34;
software is pretty awful.  Of course, when you have systems making use of open
source/free software components, then you need local expertise to manage and support
them, and this goes against the belief that it&#39;s safest to have systems for which you
can easily buy support, because they use out-of-the box components put together
according to the manual.  Although this approach produces poorer quality systems that
cost more in the long run to maintain and update, it&#39;s very hard to convince
(non-technical) higher managers of this.
</blockquote>

<p>In 2016, Le Blanc accepted voluntary severance from ITS and moved on
to teaching, where he is still active.</p>

<p>Linux would not have made it this far without Le Blanc—and others like
him—making incremental contributions that paved the way for more people to use
and improve Linux. MCC Interim Linux did not last long, but it was an important
stepping stone on the path to longer-lived distributions like Debian.</p><p>
