<p><a href="https://as.tufts.edu/philosophy/people/faculty/daniel-dennett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professor Dennett</a> wrote extensively about issues related to philosophy of mind and cognitive science, especially <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consciousness</a>. He is also recognized as having made significant contributions to the concept of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intentionality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intentionality</a> and debates on free will. Some of Professor Dennett’s books include <em>Content and Consciousness</em> (1969), <em>Brainstorms: Philosophical Essays on Mind and </em>Psychology (1981), <em>The Intentional </em>Stance (1987), <em>Consciousness Explained </em>(1992), <em>Darwin’s Dangerous Idea</em> (1995), <em>Breaking the Spell</em> (2006), and <em>From Bacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds</em> (2017). He published a memoir last year entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ive-Been-Thinking-Daniel-Dennett/dp/0393868052?crid=51C0GBFOVG3H&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.hIpcSTR5ukdvp9pwaMShvmgOhE6cR6nMWfn3FiKU2lR5t4U1aPV3aLrkD_rloa9wh5ZiEQCB2EznPjdy-j1ViIH-whS3IYpOLEbN52Z4EyMdO07c-YsB6deygzHiUy_HND1J4CrH50PdwErFPt6kPQ7EJBmsSIQZLQqh45MAzhc5Gfgw7pgyu9I1_Fi7ZPfhP-HKiVQVBdCAEWr11Jhj0tbB4a9JkQE4a-8by8uKDfg.1tQQS7Na3UvKRDFFxnaJT6y9ZHM816io4nCfd0VUsXk&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=i%27ve+been+thinking+daniel+c.+dennett&amp;qid=1713539861&amp;sprefix=I%27ve+been+thinking+%2Caps%2C98&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=dainou-20&amp;linkId=491277c6dd818b511f737b621b10ec99&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>I’ve Been</em> <em>Thinking</em></a>. There are also several books about him and his ideas. You can learn more about his work <a href="https://philpapers.org/s/Daniel%20dennett" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Professor Dennett held a position at Tufts University for nearly all his career. Prior to this, he held a position at the University of California, Irvine from 1965 to 1971. He also held visiting positions at Oxford, Harvard, Pittsburgh, and other institutions during his time at Tufts University. Professor Dennett was awarded his PhD from the University of Oxford in 1965 and his undergraduate degree in philosophy from Harvard University in 1963.</p>
<p>Professor Dennett is the recipient of several awards and prizes including the Jean Nicod Prize, the Mind and Brain Prize, and the Erasmus Prize. He also held a Fulbright Fellowship, two Guggenheim Fellowships, and a Fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences. An outspoken atheist, Professor Dennett was dubbed one of the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atheism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Four Horsemen of New Atheism</a>”. He was also a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, an honored Humanist Laureate of the International Academy of Humanism, and was named Humanist of the Year by the American Humanist Organization.</p>
<p>He died this morning from complications of interstitial lung disease.*</p>
