                    <p>Alice and Bob are the world’s most famous cryptographic couple. Since their invention in 1978, they have at once been called “inseparable,” and have been the subject of numerous divorces, travels, and torments. In the ensuing years, other characters have joined their cryptographic family. There’s Eve, the passive and submissive eavesdropper, Mallory the malicious attacker, and Trent, trusted by all, just to name a few.</p>
                    <p>While Alice, Bob, and their extended family were originally used to explain how public key cryptography works, they have since become widely used across other science and engineering domains. Their influence continues to grow outside of academia as well: Alice and Bob are now a part of geek lore, and subject to narratives and visual depictions that combine pedagogy with in-jokes, often reflecting of the sexist and heteronormative environments in which they were born and continue to be used. More than just the world’s most famous cryptographic couple, Alice and Bob have become an archetype of digital exchange, and a lens through which to view broader digital culture.</p>
                    <p>This website details the major events in the “lives” of Alice and Bob, from their birth in 1978 onwards. It is also the public, multimedia component for a related academic research project by <a href="#contact">Quinn DuPont and Alana Cattapan.</a></p>

                <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                    <p>Alice and Bob are fictional characters originally invented to make research in cryptology easier to understand. In a now-famous paper (“A method for obtaining digital signatures and public-key cryptosystems”), authors <a href="#born">Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman</a> described exchanges between a sender and receiver of information as follows: “For our scenarios we suppose that A and B (also known as Alice and Bob) are two users of a public-key cryptosystem.” In that instant, Alice and Bob were born.</p>

                            <p>Diffie and Hellman’s proposal for public key cryptography set the course for future research, but their analysis still lacked the all-important one-way function, <img src="http://pepijndevos.nl/2023/12/24/img/rsa_field.png" alt="Picture of Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman in a field"/> needed to generate the public and private key parts. Moreover, there was no working implementation of the cryptosystem. In 1977, young MIT computer scientists Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman found a suitable one-way function and then developed a working implementation of public key cryptography.</p>

                        <p>In the history of cryptology, women tend to be either systematically excluded or reduced to objects. The absence of women is both a reflection of the bias of society and historians, and a gap in the employment of women in computing fields. In the early history of computing, in fact, women were key to the development of computing, and especially cryptology (see <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/ca/academic/subjects/sociology/organisational-sociology/women-work-and-computing?format=PB&amp;isbn=9780521777353#ST9B8hvdWa6FYBoI.97">Woodfield, 2001</a>; <a href="http://ca.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470597194.html">Misa (ed.), 2010</a>; <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/programmed-inequality">Hicks, 2017</a>). But, once computing gained status and importance, women were increasingly pushed out of the computer and <a href="https://medium.com/the-internet-of-women/the-uk-s-history-of-pioneering-women-in-cybersecurity-cf99520b97ba">cybersecurity industry</a>. Worrisomely, in the field of cybersecurity, this trend to marginalize and exclude women has <a href="http://theinstitute.ieee.org/ieee-roundup/members/achievements/the-number-of-women-working-in-cybersecurity-is-shrinking-and-there-werent-many-to-begin-with"><i>increased</i> in recent years</a>. Those women that have managed to elbow in on the male-dominated industry are <a href="https://cryptologicfoundation.org/learn/stimulate/women-in-cryptology.html">important to highlight and celebrate.</a> Uncovering the gendered context of Alice and Bob is one chapter in the larger, untold story of women in cryptology.</p>
