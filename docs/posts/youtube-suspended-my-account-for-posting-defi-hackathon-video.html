      <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>I knew Google&#39;s automated processes were pretty bad from earlier stories here, but today I got hit by it myself.<p>I participated in the totally legit EthGlobal &#34;Hack Money&#34; hackathon (https://hackathon.money/) earlier this year and one of required submissions of that event was a video describing your work.
I made one and uploaded it to Youtube. The hackathon went great and we won some prizes but that&#39;s not relevant to this story.</p><p>Yesterday evening I received an email from Youtube that they&#39;ve removed my channel because &#34;Spam, scams or commercially deceptive content are not allowed on YouTube.&#34;.</p><p>I thought this certainly must be an error so I used the attached appeal link and got a response within less than 15 minutes that they appeal has been rejected and that no further replies will be processed.</p><p>I am a paid Youtube Music subscriber and I can&#39;t login to even listen to my own music anymore. Amazing.</p><p>I would like to think that Google&#39;s AI systems are smarter than just videoTitle.contains(&#34;hack&#34;) &amp;&amp; videoTitle.contains(&#34;money&#34;), but apparently not.</p><p>If anybody has connections who can help get me unsuspended that would be highly appreciated. The google cache of my channel is still available here:
