                        <p>A Brazilian judge has ordered Apple to pay 5,000 Brazilian reals, or $1,081, to a man for not including a power adapter with the sale of his new iPhone.</p><p>Judge Vanderlei Caires Pinheiro of a civil court in the city of Goi√¢nia ruled the practice a &#34;tie sale,&#34; or a situation in which a company requires that a customer buy two of its products for one of them to work, according to <a href="https://www.conjur.com.br/dl/decisao-apple.pdf" data-analytics-module="body_link">court documents seen by Insider</a>.</p><p>The judge said Apple had &#34;obliged the consumer to purchase a second product of its exclusive manufacture,&#34; calling it an &#34;abusive and illegal commercial practice.&#34;</p><p>In its defense, Apple said each iPhone came with a

                        <p>But the judge rejected the argument, saying the cable didn&#39;t work with wall adapters lacking a USB-C port, with which the Apple charger was designed.</p><p>He also noted that Apple said it stopped providing the power adapter out of concern for the environment and because of a supply shortage for the accessory. Pinheiro responded by saying Apple was still manufacturing its power adapters and selling them separately.</p><p>&#34;It is not appropriate that such a measure seeks to reduce environmental impacts, since, in all evidence, the defendant continues to manufacture such an essential accessory, but now sells it separately,&#34; Pinheiro said.</p><p>Apple first announced it would stop providing <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-iphone-12-rumors-no-charger-adapter-price-2020-6" data-analytics-module="body_link">power adapters with its iPhone 12 in 2020</a>, which the Brazilian government said it found to be abusive. In 2021, it fined Apple $2 million for the practice, saying the tech giant failed to demonstrate the &#34;environmental gain&#34; it had advertised, <a href="https://g1.globo.com/economia/tecnologia/noticia/2021/03/19/procon-sp-multa-apple-em-r-10-milhoes-por-vender-iphones-sem-carregador.ghtml" data-analytics-module="body_link">according to the Brazilian outlet G1</a>.</p>
