    <h1>We all need more reasons to celebrate.</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody" id="content"><p>Every now and again, figuring out how old you are in days <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/llk2ta/i_am_9999_days_old_today/">becomes a minor internet moment</a>. It’s an interesting idea: age is a <em>useful</em> concept, but it’s measured arbitrarily. We measure it in fractional orbits around the sun, but we could just as meaningfully choose:</p><ul><li>the number of times the earth has rotated on its axis (days), or</li><li>the number of times the moon has orbited the earth (~lunar months), or</li><li>the height of a specific tree in the middle of the town that you live in, or</li><li>the aggregate distance that your body has traveled relative to the center of the galaxy, like we’re all interplanetary used cars, slowly putting astronomical units on the odometer.</li></ul><hr/><p>We don’t tend to count the days, except when we’re looking forward to something – a wedding, the weekend, a deadline. But maybe we should? Birthdays are arbitrary, there is not enough joy in the world, and we all need more reasons to celebrate.</p><p>Go ahead and make a minor celebration for a friend who doesn’t like to celebrate themselves. Bring them a donut or send them a text and tell them that you’re glad that they were born 13,000 days ago.
There’s something wonderful about completely unexpected, low-pressure celebrations.</p><h2 id="if-you-liked-this">If you liked this</h2><p>You might also enjoy:</p><ul><li><a href="https://capnfabs.net/tags/people-vs.-the-internet/">Other random crap that I’ve made</a></li><li><a href="https://teresaibarra.com/texts/">Analyzing my text messages with my ex-boyfriend</a></li><li><a href="https://goodenough.us/blog/2023-08-23-bad-ideas-are-fun/">Bad Ideas are Fun</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time">Swatch Internet Time</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Fixed_Calendar">International Fixed Calendar</a></li></ul></div></div>
