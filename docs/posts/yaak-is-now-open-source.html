    <h1>Yaak is now open source</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I hate to admit it, but <strong>the Reddit, HackerNews, and Lobsters folks were right.</strong></p>
<p>Three months ago I published <a href="https://yaak.app/blog/why-not-open-source">Why Not Open Source</a> as an
attempt to explain why Yaak <em>wouldn&#39;t</em> be open source. Having burnt out on OSS in the
past, I thought that others might find my decision-making process useful, so I shared it
to the usual places.</p>
<p>Yaak users mostly agreed, which makes sense, as they were already happy with the
close-source reality. The broader open-source community, however, strongly disagreed with
almost everything.</p>

</ul>
<p>Here are a few of the highlights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don‚Äôt conflate ‚Äúopen source‚Äù/‚Äúfree software‚Äù with github‚Äôs specific social model of
drive-by contributions, or even contributions at all...

<p>But all of those things are also true of closed source software.

<p>The claims of this text are complete bullshit. No idea what this &#34;app&#34; is about,

Dont need it. Can go to the trash can of history

<p>While most of the replies weren&#39;t constructive, the quoted
<a href="https://lobste.rs/s/qeqgiq/why_yaak_is_not_open_source#c_k7tr74">500-word lobste.rs comment</a>
is absolute gold. It immediately got me thinking that <strong>maybe I was wrong.</strong> üôà</p>
<p>I wanted feedback, and that&#39;s exactly what I got.</p>
<p>The main theme was that <em><strong>open source doesn&#39;t mean open contribution.</strong></em> You can still
get most of the benefits by simply making the code public:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open to security audits</li>
<li>Transparent functionality (no shady stuff)</li>
<li>Flexibility (can still fork and modify)</li>
<li>Runnable even if the developer leaves</li>
</ul>
<p>I wanted Yaak users to experience these benefits too, which is why Yaak is now open source
but closed (mostly) for contribution.</p>
<h2 id="-open-source-closedish-contribution">üôà Open source, closed(ish) contribution</h2>
<p>Many commenters pointed to projects like SQLite which are open-source but don&#39;t allow
outside contribution. For some reason, I never even considered this to be a possibility.
While Googling for more projects like this, I came
across <a href="https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream?tab=readme-ov-file#contribution-policy">Litestream</a>,
which was initially closed to contribution and eventually opened for bug-fixes only.</p>
<p>This model made perfect sense to me, so it&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m doing. <strong>Yaak is now open
source under the MIT license and open to contribution for bug fixes only.</strong></p>
<p><em>Now the desktop Linux users can fix their own bugs (please don&#39;t hate me)</em> üòÖ</p>
