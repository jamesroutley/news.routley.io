    <h1>Japan to revise romanization rules for first time in 70 years</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                      <p>The Agency for Cultural Affairs submitted a recommendation to education minister Toshiko Abe on Wednesday to replace the government’s romanization system for the Japanese language, the first such overhaul in 70 years.</p>

<p>The agency is recommending replacing the government’s long-standing Kunrei system with more widely used Hepburn-style spellings. The changes are expected to be approved within the current fiscal year and gradually rolled out in textbooks and other materials.</p>

<p>Under the Kunrei system, codified by Cabinet notification in 1954, phonemes for ち and ふ are written as <em>ti</em> and <em>hu</em>. Most Japanese schools still teach the style in romanization studies.</p>

<p>But the Hepburn system, which renders them as <em>chi</em> and <em>fu</em>, has become dominant both in Japan and abroad, making the impact of the change likely most evident in educational materials such as school textbooks.</p>

<p>The council’s recommendation also adopts Hepburn spellings for し, じ and つ as <em>shi</em>, <em>ji</em>, and <em>tsu</em>, compared to the Kunrei spellings of <em>si, zi</em> and <em>tu</em>. It specifies that double consonants, as in てっぱん, should be written by repeating the consonant, while long vowels such as in かあさん<strong> </strong>can be indicated with either a macron (kāsan) or doubled letters (kaasan).</p>

<p>Personal and organizational names will be left to the preference of individuals and entities concerned.</p>

<p>The government began reviewing official romanization rules in 2022, with then-education minister Masahito Moriyama formally requesting a reassessment last year.</p>
