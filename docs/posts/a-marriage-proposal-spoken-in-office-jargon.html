    <h1>A marriage proposal spoken in office jargon</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p><span>GARY</span>: Hey Cindy, remember the other day when we were talking about optimizations?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Yeah, I wanted to circle back on that.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Me too. You said you wanted to see hockey-stick growth. Well, I’ve realized that I want to see hockey-stick growth too—in our relationship.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Unpack that for me.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: This relationship has been such a value-add. Some of my friends were worried that it would take too long for us to get into alignment. But you have been an absolute rockstar.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I feel the same way, Gary. The <span>ROI</span> on this relationship has been unbelievable. You’ve really given 110 percent.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: So I wanted to close the loop. In addition to the other deliverables, I have one more. (<i>He takes a knee, and holds out his hand</i>.) It’s this wedding ring. Cindy, will you marry me?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I will, Gary. You have been an absolute ninja. This moves the needle in a significant way.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Getting married will represent a huge pivot, but I see it as a quick win, and a real solve.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Me too. And we can talk about this later, but—I do want to make sure we go forward with a single source of truth.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Break that down for me.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I used to be with a guy who was full of valuable insights—but his insights weren’t actionable, let alone fundable.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Sounds like low-hanging fruit.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: He was. And I know you’re different. The synergy is unbelievable. But I want to make sure we stay focused on core values. Which, for me, comes down to the bottom line.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: By bottom line, you’re talking about the financials?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Not having enough spend was a big pain point for me. I don’t know how else to say it. You’re more than your financials, but you’re not less than them.</p>
<p>(<i>Long pause.</i>)</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: I think I understand.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Just wanted to touch base on how you’re feeling about that.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Well, look. We both know the importance of data-driven insights. So I think I’ve got a solve. What if we set up a weekly one-on-one to check in and stack hands on the financials as we start to plan for our new normal?</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: I would love that. But I’m so sorry, I have a three-thirty.</p>
<p><span>GARY</span>: Okay, let’s table this for now. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask.</p>
<p><span>CINDY</span>: Sounds good. Let’s circle back tonight, and we can action on our solve.</p>
