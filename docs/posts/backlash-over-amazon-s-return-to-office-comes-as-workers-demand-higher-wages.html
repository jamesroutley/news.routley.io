<p>Amazon currently faces disgruntled workers in every direction.</p>
<p>Office workers are raging against CEO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/amazon-kills-remote-working-tells-workers-to-be-in-office-5-days-a-week/">Andy Jassy&#39;s return to office mandate</a>, Fortune <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/09/17/amazon-andy-jassy-rto-mandate-employees-angry/">reported</a>—which came just as a leaked document reportedly showed that Amazon is also planning to gut management, Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-fewer-managers-leaked-document-2024-9">reported</a>. Drivers by the hundreds are flocking to join a union to negotiate even better work conditions, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/hundreds-of-amazon-delivery-drivers-in-new-york-join-teamsters-union.html">reported</a>, despite some of the <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazon-delivery-service-partner-dsp-rate-increases-investment">biggest concessions in Amazon&#39;s history</a>. And hundreds more unionized warehouse workers are increasingly banding together nationwide to <a href="https://labornotes.org/2024/07/new-york-amazon-workers-demand-paid-juneteenth-holiday">demand a $25 an hour minimum wage</a>. On Wednesday, workers everywhere were encouraged to <a href="https://act.united4respect.org/a/make-call-warehouse-workers-deserve-living-wage">leave Jassy a voicemail</a> elevating workers&#39; demands for a $25 minimum wage.</p>
<h2>Putting on the pressure</h2>
<p>This momentum has been building for years after <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/teamsters-to-vote-thursday-on-sweeping-push-to-unionize-amazon-workers.html">drivers unionized in 2021</a>. And all this collective fury increasingly appears to be finally pressuring Amazon into negotiating better conditions for some workers.</p>
<p>Just <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazon-delivery-service-partner-dsp-rate-increases-investment">last week</a>, Amazon ponied up $2.1 billion—its &#34;biggest investment yet&#34;—to improve driver safety and increase drivers&#39; wages.</p>
<p>Unionizing warehouse workers told Ars that they&#39;re seeking a similar investment from Amazon, which currently pays on average a $20.50 minimum wage.</p>
<p>&#34;We work at a breakneck pace,&#34; Christine Manno, an Amazon Fulfillment Center worker at Amazon site STL8 in St. Louis, Missouri, who was injured and never expects to work again, told Ars. &#34;We put smiles on the billionaire&#39;s faces, and we feel it&#39;s prime time for a real raise for the employees. There&#39;s too many of us struggling with food and housing, yet Andy Jassy took home <a href="https://x.com/moworkerscenter/status/1803912601421910144">over $14,000 an hour last year</a> and Amazon is making billions in profit.&#34;</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>On Wednesday, Amazon seemed to finally bend to the warehouse workers&#39; pressure, announcing a compromise on wage increases. The company said it was investing $2.2 billion to raise the base salaries of hourly fulfillment workers to &#34;more than $22 an hour, and more than $29 an hour including benefits,&#34; Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazon-raises-pay-hourly-workers-fulfillment-transport-ops-2024-09-18/">reported</a>.</p>
<p>But while workers claimed the victory, they&#39;re not going to sit back and take the pay bump. An STL8 worker on the organizing committee with Manno, Ash Judd, told Ars that workers &#34;made this $1.50 raise happen through our tireless organizing, and we&#39;ll keep fighting until we reach $25.&#34;</p>
<p>Because of recent gains and the increasingly dire economic plight of workers, Amazon workers likely won&#39;t be easing off the e-commerce giant any time soon. Some office workers told Fortune they are seeking other remote work to avoid returning to the office, threatening to &#34;soft quit&#34; and claiming that Amazon is going &#34;backwards&#34; with a stricter office policy than pre-COVID times. “This is a layoff in disguise,” one apparent worker complained on Reddit. “Return to the office or you’re fired and we don’t have to pay any severance or unemployment.”</p>
<p>With so many workers upset, it could now be a question of when Amazon will cave to their growing demands—not if—according to Beth Gutelius, the research director of the University of Illinois Chicago&#39;s Center for Urban Economic Development.</p>
<p>&#34;Research shows that the presence of collective bargaining agreements creates upward pressure on wages and working conditions, both in facilities that are unionized and those that are not,&#34; Gutelius told Ars. &#34;Based on that evidence, I would expect working conditions at Amazon to improve.&#34;</p>
<p>Gutelius co-authored a May <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Handling20Hardship20Final_May2024.pdf">report</a> documenting the financial insecurity of Amazon warehouse workers by surveying more than 1,400 across 42 states.</p>
