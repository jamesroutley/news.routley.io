    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[--><!--[--><!----><!----><div> <p>age verifies your account automatically as an adult on any website using k-id</p> <p>made by <a href="https://kibty.town" target="_blank">xyzeva</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Dziurwa14" target="_blank">Dziurwa</a>, greetz to <a href="https://amplitudes.me/" target="_blank">amplitudes</a> (for previous work)</p> <!--[!--><p>the age verifier is currently patched, we are working on a fix and will update this page when
			we do.</p><!--]--> <h2>how does this work</h2> <p>k-id, the age verification provider discord uses doesn&#39;t store or send your face to the server.
		instead, it sends a bunch of metadata about your face and general process details. while this is
		good for your privacy <span>(well, considering some other providers send actual videos of your face to their servers)</span>, its also bad for them, because we can just send legitimate looking metadata to their servers
		and they have no way to tell its not legitimate. </p> <h3>step 1: encrypted_payload and auth_tag</h3> <p>the first thing we noticed that the old implementation doesn&#39;t send when comparing a legitimate
		request payload with a generated one, is its missing <code>encrypted_payload</code>, <code>auth_tag</code>, <code>timestamp</code> and <code>iv</code> in the body. </p> <h3>step 2: prediction data</h3> <p>heres where it kind of gets tricky, even after perfectly replicating the encryption, our
		verification attempt still doesn&#39;t succeed, so they must also be doing checks on the actual
		payload. </p> <ul><li><code>xScaledShiftAmt</code> and <code>yScaledShiftAmt</code> in predictions are not random but
			rather can be one of two values</li> <li>it is checked that the media name (camera) matches one of your media devices in the array of
			devices</li> <li>it is checked if the states completion times match the state timeline</li></ul> <h3>the (failed) patch</h3> <p>after the initial release, k-id&#39;s provider for face scans, privately added a patch to this
		script. however, the patch wasn&#39;t sufficient enough and we bypassed it. <span>(so the script works again!)</span> </p> </div><!----><!----><!----><!--]--> <!--[!--><!--]--><!--]-->
