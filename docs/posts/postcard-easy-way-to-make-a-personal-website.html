        Hey I&#39;m Aaron ðŸ‘‹ These days, I&#39;m focused on creating a better future of work, no-code, and designing experiences worth talking about [both IRL + digital].

I lead Community at a future-of-work startup called A.Team, creating a home on the internet for the most talented independent software builders on earth. We&#39;ve raised $60M to date (NYT, Forbes) from Tiger, Insight, Adam Grant, Michael Ovitz, Jay-Z, and the CFO of SpaceX. Â 

Outside of work, here&#39;s what else keeps me busy:Â 
â€¢ I rent a ski mountain every year for 160 friends [friendsrentamountain.com]
â€¢ Volunteer as the no-code lead for US Digital Response
â€¢ Dabbling in new products as a Partner at Quiet Ventures, a small NYC-based startup studio
â€¢ EIR at the National University of Singapore
â€¢ Adjunct Professor at Binghamton University
â€¢ Running Founders Friday NYC
â€¢ Thursday Night Softball
â€¢ Enthusiastic supporter of dinner parties, Mets games, Citi Bike, Broadway rush tickets, good government, friend matchmaking, independent ski areas, history museums, last-minute trips, clever dodgeball strategy, and walking tours.
