<a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/roundups/2025-05-29/about.html">By Artyom Bologov</a>

<p>
I have a long story with bipolar spikes making me re-evaluate my tech choices.
You can observe it with multiple of my website setups:
<a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/roundups/2025-05-29/tripod.html">I started with Tripod, my Gemtext-oriented OOP Lisp engine</a>.
<a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/roundups/2025-05-29/this-post-is-lisp.html">Then I used the DSLs Common Lisp provides to generate HTML from s-expressions</a>.
<a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/roundups/2025-05-29/this-post-is-cpp.html">And, finally, I switched to C Preprocessor</a>.
And here&#39;s a new flare-up, I guess?

</p><p>
This time I&#39;m testing the limits of what ed-family editors can do.
<a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/roundups/2025-05-29/paren-regex.html">Including parsing Lisp</a>.
<a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/roundups/2025-05-29/sed-ed.html">And using ed as an everyday scripting environment</a>.

</p><p>
I&#39;ve also tried ex/vi (not Vim!)
<a href="https://github.com/aartaka/emvi">To the point of making a Lisp programming config for it</a>.
<a href="https://merveilles.town/@aartaka/113546886276193594">But ex/vi are too troublesome, so forget it</a>.

</p><p>
Back to ed then!
<a href="https://github.com/aartaka/modal.ed">Here&#39;s a compiler from high-level Modal system to ed, written in ed itself</a>.
<a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/roundups/2025-05-29/scripts/wisp.ed">Here&#39;s a script processing Wisp syntax extension for Lisps</a>.
<a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Ed">And here&#39;s a whole category for ed tasks I solved on RosettaCode</a>.
The overarching narrative can be a transformation from one format to the other.
Like... what site generators do?
So I can use ed as my site generator, and get away with it?

</p> <section id="setup"><h2>Setup: Glorified ed Scripts <a href="#setup">#</a></h2>

<p>
So the way ed scripts are ran:

</p><figure><pre lang="sh">ed -s file.html &lt; script.ed
</pre><figcaption>Example script run</figcaption></figure>

<p>
This incantation

</p><ul><li> Opens a <code>file.html</code>,
</li><li>  Reads commands from stdin (redirected <code>script.ed</code>.)
</li><li>  And saves/writes (<code>w</code> command) file if there are respective commands in the stdin.
</li></ul>

<p>
A huge advantage is that I can swap commands in the script file.
Replacing writing commands to printing ones, for example.
This way, I can print the content of the post without modifying it.
Y&#39;know, for blog debugging (everyone does that?)

</p><p>
With that general formula, I can abstract article builds per format with two scripts:
a preprocessing (deabbreviation and escaped char expansion) script and the actual conversion.
Here&#39;s how
<a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/roundups/2025-05-29/makefile">my Makefile rule for .txt building</a>
looks like:

</p><figure><pre lang="">%.txt: %.h
	-cp $^ $@
	-ed -s $@ &lt; <a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/roundups/2025-05-29/scripts/preprocess.ed">scripts/preprocess.ed</a>
	-ed -s $@ &lt; <a href="https://cceckman.com/reading/roundups/2025-05-29/scripts/totxt.ed">scripts/totxt.ed</a>
</pre><figcaption>Makefile implicit rule for conversion from .h to actual output text files</figcaption></figure>

<p>
Repeat this for every format (my site supports five atm) with dedicated <code>to*.ed</code> scripts.
And that&#39;s it!

</p></section> <section id="advantages"><h2>Advantages <a href="#advantages">#</a></h2>

<p>
I can use whatever syntax I want now!
With C Preprocessor, I was restricted to <code>X(ARG1, ARG2, ...)</code> structure for all my elements.
With ed, I can go crazy with something like <code>&lt;cd code-here&gt;</code>, imitating self-closing HTML tags.
Or whatever.
Closer to the way I model my writing.

</p><p>
Another upside: I don&#39;t have to rewrite all of my posts in a new format.
My ed scripts are processing the old preprocessor-oriented format too!
So ed is capable of replacing C Preprocessor and even adds some features on top.

</p><p>
One more advantage is that there no longer are weird chars breaking everything.
When I see an apostrophe, my eye starts twitching.
C Preprocessor recognizes apostrophe as a char marker and reads the rest of the line verbatim.
Same goes for double quote and hash.
Special chars, forbidden magic.

</p><p>
In general, ed has this sloppiness of regex/substitutions.
And interactivity of a REPL (well, to an extent.)
Perfect for text processing and document authoring.

</p></section> <section id="limitations"><h2>Limitations <a href="#limitations">#</a></h2>

<p>
ed is stupid (I say lovingly.)
It has no file inclusion, for one.
So C Preprocessor&#39;s <code>#include</code> is no longer accessible.
I manage without it, because most of the files I include are easily hard-codeable.
But the mere inability to include arbitrary files is somewhat alarming.

</p><p>
Another problem that I already got the taste of:
having arbitrary substitutions at the fingertips spoils me.
I might end up with some really otherworldly syntax without noticing.
And I wouldn&#39;t be able to rollback to e.g. C Preprocessor to generate my posts.
But then, ed is so simple and more or less standard, so what can go wrong?

</p><details><summary>It did go wrong</summary>
<p>
Arch and Alpine package slightly different versions of ed.
Alpine version was breaking on line joining and variable substitution.
So I had to swap Alpine for Arch on the Gitlab CI.
I would have been able to stay on Alpine if I was able to debug what&#39;s wrong with ed there.
But Gitlab (like any other CI platform?) doesn&#39;t make it easy to debug things on CI.
</p></details>

</section> <section id="you-too"><h2>Should You Use ed As Site Generator? <a href="#you-too">#</a></h2>

<p>
No, not at all.
It&#39;s a weird choice that&#39;s only there because I&#39;m having a new phase.
But still, it&#39;s fun!
Try ed if you have too much free time and are bored out of your mind ðŸ˜œ
