    <h1>Help! Is This Arabic?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
         
         <div><p>Your deadline is coming up, and for some reason you&#39;re the one handling Arabic text on the project. Of course, you can&#39;t read a single letter of Arabic, so you can&#39;t tell whether you&#39;re doing it right. Since I am tired of seeing my script misrepresented in media and you or your employer refuse to just hire someone for this, I will give you a number of easy pointers to avoid embarrassing yourself &amp; your project to almost 2 billion people.</p></div>

            1. Arabic script is aligned to the right. Interface flows from the right. If your Arabic is aligned to the left, your text is wrong.
         </p>
         <p><img src="https://isthisarabic.com/l2.png"/>
            2. Arabic script generally has a clear and visible baseline, connecting the letters. If you cannot find a baseline, your text is wrong.
         </p>

            3. In general, the letter combination ال  should be common. The combination ل​​​‌ا  cannot occur in Arabic script, as those characters should be connected.

            <h4>18 minute crash course</h4>
            <p>Here&#39;s a <b>18 minute video</b> of I talk I gave at <a href="https://xoxofest.com/" target="_blank">XOXO</a> in 2015 that&#39;ll teach you more than enough Arabic to not embarrass yourself in front of everyone who can read the Arabic alphabet to some degree. That&#39;s about 2 billion people, or 28% of the human population, <span>and they will absolutely notice that you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing and laugh at you in languages you cannot even read</span>.</p>

              <h4>Found an example of Not Arabic?</h4>
              <p>Please submit it to <a href="https://notarabic.com/" target="_blank">notarabic.com</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/ra" target="_blank">@ra</a>, so it can join a list of small independent companies with limited budgets, such as <a title="Managed to mess up &#39;United Nations&#39; somehow, despite Arabic being one of the seven official languages of the UN.">Disney</a>, <a title="Managed to mess up a faked screenshot of their own UI.">Google</a>, <a title="Managed to write &#39;zero&#39; backwards for Coca Cola Zero.">Coca Cola</a>, <a title="Managed to spell &#39;love&#39;, a two letter word, backwards in that one weird riot ad.">Pepsi</a>, <a title="Managed to mess up &#39;shokran&#39;, one of the most common Arabic words.">Github</a>, <a title="Managed to mess up &#39;welcome&#39; in Westworld.">HBO</a>, <a title="Managed to mess up United Nations in Arabic in Captain America: Civil War.">Marvel</a>, and other such companies that would rather insult a tenth of the human population than actually pay to have someone who knows the language look at it. <span>Shoutout to Marvel Studios <a href="https://www.notarabic.com/?31" target="_blank">for getting &#39;United Nations&#39; wrong</a>, something you can check in about 2 seconds at <a href="https://un.org/ar" target="_blank">un.org/ar</a>.</span></p>

              <p>The Arabic-scripted languages are spoken, read, and/or written to some degree by over 2 billion people on Earth. I hope this will you help in case you cannot afford to hire anyone at all with a elementary school level of Arabic script reading.
