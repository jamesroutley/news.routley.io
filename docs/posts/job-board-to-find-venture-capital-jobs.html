<p>Most people donâ€™t know that installing software packages takes more time than programming.</p>



<p>This is why using containers is so revolutionary â€“ they are like little preinstalled computers.</p>



<p>This is what I learned day 2 of solidity programming</p>



<p>My computer ground to a halt.</p>



<p>I ran the three functions in scaffolding eth. I started them stopped them restarted them. And then my computer stopped.</p>



<p>I had like 10 million node processes running. Maybe I should run this in a container!</p>



<p>While waiting for everything install I thought about port 3000.</p>



<p>Is it related to @mst3k mystery science theater 3000?</p>



<p>Probably not but I went down a rabbit hole.</p>



<p>Here are all mst3k episodes ranked.</p>



<p>I have a favorite â€“ but I donâ€™t know its name ðŸ˜¦</p>



<p>I started programming a python app.</p>



<p>The python app turns mantras into sounds. I am going to use #scipy and matrices. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/soundstretching-and-pitch-shifting-in-python/">http://zulko.github.io/blog/2014/03/29/soundstretching-and-pitch-shifting-in-python/</a></p>



<p>Maybe I will work on it more doing this 30for30 when solidity is slow â€“ like saving things to the blockchain.</p>



<p>At one point my terminal stopped working!</p>



<p>The error: <strong>Clear error in Linux: Terminals Database Is Inaccessible Solution </strong><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://programmersought.com/article/78227910950/"><strong>https://programmersought.com/article/78227910950/</strong></a></p>



<p>I reset the terminal emulation:</p>



<p>I researched tricking out my tmux config â€“ as one does.</p>



<p>Can different panes in #tmux have different color schemes?</p>



<p>Day 2 and it does not feel like much solidity was learned, but sometimes the hardest part is getting your environment set up</p>
