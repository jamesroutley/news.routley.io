    <h1>What It Takes to Be a Good Engineering Manager</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><header><p><time datetime="2025-06-19">June 19th, 2025</time> • ~400 words • 2 minute read</p></header><p>There is no shortage of opinions on this topic. The most honest answer is probably “it depends” but that’s also the least helpful.</p><p>After 4.5 years leading multiple engineering teams, here’s my single-sentence answer to what makes a great manager:</p><blockquote><p>A good manager balances high empathy with high expectations and knows when to pull which lever.</p></blockquote><p>High expectations without empathy might “succeed” but at the cost of toxicity. It’s not my definition of success or <a href="https://george.mand.is/2021/10/facebook-recruiter-correspondence/">something I want to be part of</a>.</p><p>High empathy without expectations can leave a team adrift. It comes at the cost of growth, learning and output.</p><p>In interviewing for new engineering leadership positions I’ve found this line lands very well when trying to describe my own engineering leadership philosophies and values. I like to think this is because I really <em>mean</em> it. This isn’t a pithy mantra I picked up in an engineering management book—it’s a core tenet I’ve seen, felt, and lived.</p><p>I&#39;ve been in situations where I could see I was pushing people too hard and needed to back-off without making them feel like they&#39;ve failed. There have also been situations where I knew people could do more and found ways to gracefully challenge them. It&#39;s all part of navigating the tricky calculus of people, projects and priorities.</p><p>What you’re really calibrating for is the right amount of tension. It looks different for each individual, and each person&#39;s tension has to be balanced with the team as a whole. Think of it like a musical instrument with strings. There’s an appropriate amount of tension to achieve the desired frequency for each string and there’s an overall amount that the instrument itself can withstand.</p><p>I’m a firm believer in the <a href="https://www.recurse.com/self-directives">Recurse Center&#39;s self-directives</a>. They&#39;ve been a significant part of my &#34;high expectations&#34; for people on the various teams I managed. They&#39;re a beautiful set of principles to build any community around.</p><p>This approach engenders a culture that tends to attract and keep curious, life-long learners. People who holistically care about their work and how it fits into the whole. On its best days it feels like a fun class everyone has elected to take.</p><p>There’s no substitute for giving a shit—about every person, the team, and the work we do together.</p><p>❧ If you care as much about people as outcomes and you’re looking for an engineering leader who’ll pull the right levers, <a href="https://george.mand.is/hire">let’s chat</a>.</p>--<p><em>Published on Thursday, June 19th 2025.
