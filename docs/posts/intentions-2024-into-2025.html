    <h1>Intentions: 2024 into 2025</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over on <a href="https://llllllll.co">the lines forum</a>, I snagged the opportunity to be the one who started <a href="https://llllllll.co/t/goals-2025/70222/35">the yearly goals thread</a>. (Actually, I was hoping that one of the previous posters would have started it, but then suddenly it was almost the new year and the thread had still not started.) I really appreciated these threads over the past couple years. Slightly uncharacteristically, my contribution, which I just wrote today, has very little in the way of specific achievements I&#39;m in pursuit of. Anyway, the purpose of this post is to riff on what I wrote there. (By the way, if you&#39;re reading this and would like an invitation to join the conversation, please feel invited to sign up and chime in.)</p></div><div><div id="remainder"><p>In my reply to the thread, I gave an answer for how 2024 felt. Here&#39;s how it shook out in terms of Things Done.</p><p>I spoke at the Joint Math Meetings in January in San Francisco. It was my first time visiting the city, and I was pleased with myself for skipping an entire day of the conference in order to do things like: meet <a href="https://willpragnell.com">Will Pragnell</a> and <a href="https://rgbrgbrgb.bandcamp.com/album/ceramics-class">RGB</a> in meatspace, walk around the Mission neighborhood in a (failed) search for a compelling thrift store and a successful search for a bookstore, where I bought a bell hooks book (<em>The Will to Change</em>) which I read in August and a Thich Nhat Hanh book (<em>Going Home: Jesus and Buddha as Brothers</em>), which I read a week or two later while doing jury duty.</p><p>In late January I led a workshop on <a href="https://vcvrack.com">VCV Rack</a> with <a href="https://dndrks.com">Dani Derks</a> and performed on a bill with them and <a href="https://acampbellpayne.com">A. Campbell Payne</a>, both in Worcester, Massachusetts.</p><p>Spoke in seminars at CUNY, Temple, McGill and SUNY Buffalo, and an AMS meeting in Albany. Spent a week with a SQuaRE at <a href="https://aimath.org">AIM</a> in Pasadena. Broke my streak (since September 2023) of doing a Celtic cross tarot spread every day in February. Had two fairly short relationships. Visited Georgia (the country) with two of my siblings, where I was a worse sport than I intended to be—I was caught off-guard by the common practice in Georgian churches and monasteries for women to cover their hair (and occasionally don a skirt) and men to remove any hat they had on. Georgia, it turns out, is positively <em>littered</em> with monasteries, and all of them poked at my gender in a place that I hadn’t fully realized I was vulnerable.</p><p>Spent 12 weeks attending <a href="https://recurse.com">The Recurse Center</a>. Realized partway through doing it that I was transitioning again. Wrote many tens of thousands of lines of code, much of it for <a href="https://github.com/robbielyman/seamstress">Seamstress</a>, most of which didn’t stick yet. Performed twice with <a href="https://janiejaffe.com">Janie Jaffe</a>, once with LiveCodeNYC and once at VJoltron. Worked on music for a new play which the cast and I ultimately decided not to move forward with. Read at least 15 books. Hit the ArXiv with new papers four times, all of them collaborations. Completed Advent of Code (for 2022) in Rust and (for 2024) in Zig.</p><p>I have a bunch of longer-term goals that I’d like to continue working towards, but I’m not particularly bothered on whether I finish them this year. Indeed, it would not surprise me if I abandoned them or worked on something different; that’s pretty par for the course. Having the goals and attempting to strive for them usually helps me work out what I should really be doing. Here are three.</p><ul><li>I’d like to write Album #2 as Alanza, tentatively titled <em>Moire</em>.</li><li>I’d like to write a book. The shape of book has kind of been slippery, but I think it is probably mathematical at least a little.</li><li>I’d like to get Seamstress closer to my original vision for version 2.</li></ul><p>Most of what I’m interested in working on is a bit more process-oriented. In September I happened to make a list of things I’d like to be doing daily, weekly and monthly. At the time I was pretty struck by how many things I wanted to be doing every day. It seemed to me then that it would be pretty challenging to keep up with all of them. This was useful! It let me allow myself to fail to actually do everything I would like to do daily daily without needing to therefore give up the intention to do them daily.</p><p><strong>Daily:</strong></p><ul><li>Physical:<ul><li>Tooth care (brushing 2x, flossing 1x, mouthwash)</li><li>Pushups</li><li>Tidy my room</li><li>Chores</li></ul></li><li>Mental / Creative:<ul><li>日本語を練習</li><li>Read I managed at least 15 books last year, but ideally would like to reactivate the part of myself that read voraciously as a child. I have a decently long train commute many days of the week, which is a perfect opportunity to read a book rather than rotting on my phone.</li><li>Write In addition to being a professional writer (of academic math) I am interested in writing creatively, blogging, etc.</li><li>Music At my most recent peak of music-making in 2022, I was in the habit of finishing work for the day and opening up Ableton or firing up a synthesizer to play with. I observed to myself once that when I go too long without playing an instrument, something inside me knots up.</li></ul></li><li>Spiritual:<ul><li>Journal</li><li>Meditate</li><li>Throw tarot</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Weekly:</strong></p><ul><li>Cleaning (my room, the bathroom, other parts of the apartment)</li><li>Cooking</li><li>Maintain my planner + calendar</li><li>Blog</li><li>See friends, visit the Recurse Center</li><li>Code</li></ul><p><strong>Monthly:</strong></p><ul><li>Plan for the next month</li><li>See a show</li><li>Deep clean something</li><li>Set goals</li></ul><p>I have a couple alterations I’d make to this list today, but for some reason not enough to write them either in this post or on my notebook just yet. Partly since my semester hasn’t started yet, it’s been gratifying to realize that I’ve done a bit better of a job maintaining work on these intentions than I expected.</p></div></div></div>
