it often happens that a power rating of some part is exceeded or its cooling is insufficient.
It would be beneficial to see such situations before the parts express their distress with a
smoke signal.

<hr/><a name="How"></a><h2>How
</h2>
<p>
A breadborad was modified with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermochromism" title="Wikipedia link: Thermochromism" target="_blank">thermochromic paint</a><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQBAMAAADt3eJSAAAAMFBMVEWEg4R6e3pIR0jp6Om5urmpqKmYmJhpamlXWFf8/fw8OjwoKCjY2dgZGBnIx8gEAgRb5tWnAAAAcklEQVR4nGOYCQUMmAwPlamKJyXOVDBM2DJT+zDb5DKGOdctc+MqJ1cyzOx9eWhD5JRIhpm+nNN+zDTwZJg5SWfOopkHgdonfJ2z2jMNZM4O06pKZhCDS/TgNk4QI3rrlN0vQYxJOjOrwXZNeTnzCJKlAFOARWjqKuE5AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC"/>, mixed from a white
acrylic model-grade paint and a thermochromic pigment obtained from <a href="http://www.mutr.co.uk/" title="remote link: http://www.mutr.co.uk/" target="_blank">Middlesex University Teaching Resources</a><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCgAKAIABAGZmZv///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAAKAAoAAAIVjA8Jx6FvVmrL1chu3c1h+mXRoxgFADs="/>
webshop, using a makeshift pot made from the bottom part of a beverage can. 
The orange color was chosen on the basis of availability (read: mistakenly ordering four
oranges instead of intended four different hues.) The threshold temperature of the pigment
was chosen also on the basis of availability (they did not have any other than 29-30 °C).
</p>
<p>
The active area, where the parts are located by at least one pin, was coated with the
mixed paint. Care was taken to not let too much of it drip into the pin holes.
The power buses were not painted.
</p>
<hr/><a name="Results"></a><h2>Results
</h2>
<p>
The first tests were done during a particularly warm summer night, when the indoor temperature
reached close to threshold temperature of the pigment. At such conditions, the sensitivity of the
paint was outstanding; a 250-milliwatt resistor loaded with 350 milliwatts shown a color change around
its leg within several seconds.
</p>
<p>
The reverse change was much slower. Due to some hysteresis of the pigment and the closeness of the
room temperature to the threshold temperature, the thermal trace was present for a fairly long time
(minutes). Putting the board out of the window, where the temperature was slightly lower, markedly
accelerated restoring of the color.
</p>
<p>
The thermal trace (the discoloration of the pigment) tended to bleed around the board as its material
spread the heat. The width of the trace, and the speed of its spreading, can provide a visual clue
about how much is the part heating.
</p>
<p>
Caveat: The color change shows the part&#39;s color indirectly. There is a delay between the temperature
change of the part itself and temperature change of the board, which is usually provided via thermal
conduction through the part&#39;s legs. There is also a thermal differential between the part itself,
along its leg, and over the board.
</p>
<hr/><a name="Possibleimprovements"></a><h2>Possible improvements
</h2>
<ul><li> Use a darker pigment with a different hue (most likely blue or black)
</li><li> Use a pigment with a different threshold temperature (e.g. 43 °C, that could be optimal)
</li><li> Best: Use a pair of pigments with different colors and different thresholds, yielding two color changes at two temperatures
</li><li> Incorporate the pigment directly into the material the breadboard is made from
