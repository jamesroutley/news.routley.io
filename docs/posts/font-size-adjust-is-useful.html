    <h1>Font-size-adjust Is Useful</h1>

        <p>
          In this article, I will describe a recent addition to CSS, the <code>font-size-adjust</code> property. I am also making a bold claim that
          everyone in the world misunderstands the usefulness of this property,
          including <a href="https://web.dev/blog/font-size-adjust">Google</a>,
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust">MDN</a>, and
          <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#propdef-font-size-adjust">CSS Specification itself</a>. (Just to clarify, no, I am not a web
          designer and I have no idea what I am talking about).
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s start with oversimplified and incorrect explanation of <code>font-size</code>
          (see <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/font-size/">https://tonsky.me/blog/font-size/</a> for details). Let’s say you
          specified <code>font-size: 96px</code>. What does that mean? First,
          draw a square 96 pixels high:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <span ;="">
          </span>
        </figure>
        <p>Then, draw a letter “m” somewhere inside this box:</p>
        <figure>
          <span>m</span>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This doesn’t make sense? I haven’t told you how large the letter m
          should be? Tiny? Huge? Well, sorry, but that’s really how font size
          works. It’s a size of the box around the glyph, not the size of the
          glyph. And there isn’t really much consistency between the fonts as to
          how large the glyph itself should be. Here’s a small “x” in the three
          fonts used on my blog at 48px font size:
        </p>
        <span>x</span>
        <span>x</span>
        <span font-weight:="" 300="">x</span>
        <p>
          They are quite different! And this is where <code>font-size-adjust</code> comes in. If I specify
          <span><code>font-size-adjust: ex-height
              0.5</code>,</span>
          I ask the browser to scale the font such that the letter “x” is
          exactly half of the box. This makes the fonts comparable:
        </p>
        <span>x</span>
        <span>x</span>
        <span font-weight:="" 300="">x</span>
        <section id="Me-vs-Everyone">
          <h2>
            <a href="#Me-vs-Everyone">Me vs. Everyone </a>
          </h2>
          <p>
            Now, the part where I foolishly disagree with the world! The way
            this property is described in
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust">MDN</a>
            and elsewhere is as if it only matters for the font fallback. That
            is, if you have
            <span><code>font-family: Futura,
                sans-serif</code>,</span> one potential problem could be that
            the fallback sans-serif font on the user’s machine will have very
            different size from Futura. So, the page could look very differently
            depending on whether fallback kicks in or not (and fallback can kick
            in
            <em>temporarily</em>, while the font is being loaded). So, the
            official guideline is, roughly,
          </p>

          <figure>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                When using font fallback, find a value of <code>font-size-adjust</code> that makes no change for the first font
                of the fallback stack.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
          </figure>
          <p>
            I don’t find this to be a particularly compelling use-case! Make
            sure to vendor the fonts used, specify <code>@font-face</code>
            inline in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> to avoid extra round trips, add
            <span><code>font-display: block;</code></span>
            and FOUC is solved for most people. Otherwise, you might want to
            stick to <code>system-ui</code> font.
          </p>
          <p>
            A use-case for <code>font-size-adjust</code> I find <em>much</em>
            more compelling is that you probably are going to use several fonts
            on a web-page. And you also might <em>change</em> fonts in the
            future. And they will have different intrinsic size because that’s
            how the things are. Part of the mess is avoidable by pinning the
            meaning of font size. So, the guideline I’d use is:
          </p>

          <figure>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Stick <span><code>font-size-adjust: ex-height
                    0.53;</code></span>
                into your CSS reset, right next to <code>box-sizing:
                  border-box</code>.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Why <code>0.53</code>? That’s the invariant ratio for Helvetica, but
            any number in that vicinity should work!
