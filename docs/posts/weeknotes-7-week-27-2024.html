<li>better late than never on this one!</li>
<li>this week has been pretty empty of writing and internet and tech stuff, been a very afk/meatspace week which has been nice in a lot of ways.</li>
<li>finished planning my quarter on the 1st which felt auspicious; the only one I&#39;m gonna share of the four is that I want to create more online. I like doing weeknotes so will keep those up, but trying to ramp up my output on <a href="https://olu.online/contact">all my social media</a> and here cos I feel like I have been in input/consume mode for too long.</li>
<li>turns out there&#39;s no consensus on what length of video essay is best for consistently actually completing the things. Almost as if it&#39;s completely subjective.</li>
<li>starting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OluOutlines">another YouTube channel</a> about planning/reviewing/outlining your life, no posts yet but excited about it. Need to work out if I&#39;m going to have a public facing goals list and my private goals for video recording reasons lol.</li>
<li>might write/record/etc a piece about the blurring and crumbling boundaries of public and private online; maybe that can be my second TikTok.</li>
<li>also wondering about a public facing content calendar/WIP on my <a href="https://notes.olu.online">notes</a> site, but I think i need some kind of commenting or upvoting system if i do that to make it useful to me for planning purposes.</li>
<li>stalled a bit on my habits website snapback; i&#39;m struggling with <a href="https://finchcare.com/">Finch</a> at the minute and assume that all apps/websites eventually get annoying or intrusive to a lot of people. I know I should just build it for what i want and what i need now and not worry about hypothetical users lol, but easier said than done.</li>
</ul>
