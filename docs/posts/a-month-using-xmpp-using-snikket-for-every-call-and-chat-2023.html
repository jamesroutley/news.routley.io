    <h1>A month using XMPP (using Snikket) for every call and chat (2023)</h1>

<article>
    <p>For the last month, I’ve been using XMPP (using Snikket) for every call and chat between me and my wife Sandra, at least.</p>
<p>Sandra and I switched from using Matrix to using XMPP a while back. Matrix was pretty good for messaging, although quite a few encryption-related issues, but it - or my installation of it, possibly - was unreliable for audio and video. Sometimes it would work, sometimes it would not.</p>
<p>Moving to XMPP - using prosody - worked really well for messaging, but the lack of real-time notifications on Sandra’s iPhone was sub-optimal, and the lack of any notifications for incoming XMPP calls on her phone was <em>really</em> undesirable.</p>
<p>I <a href="https://neilzone.co.uk/2023/07/snikket-a-self-contained-xmpp-distribution">installed Snikket, a self-contained XMPP distribution</a> just over a month ago and, since then, we’ve tried to use that for every call and message.</p>
<p>And we have very nearly succeeded - I can think of only two times where I fell back on using a cellular call instead of an XMPP call:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One was where Sandra was somewhere with very poor cellular data coverage (as in, cannot load a basic web page of check email), so fair enough.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another was when I was in Westminster, so there really shouldn’t have been a coverage problem, but there was an annoying latency on the connection of a few seconds, which made me think that perhaps the cell was congested, or something like that. Enough for a monologue or to get an important message across, but too poor for a meaningful conversation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But other than those two occasions, voice and video have been incredibly reliable. We’ve had quite long calls using it, moving between cells, and switching between Wi-Fi and cellular connections, and it has been great. I haven’t experimented yet too much with calls from my computer; that’s still to come.</p>
<p>Messaging, including photo sharing, has worked flawlessly throughout.</p>
<p>Sandra is, with no disrepect meant, a pretty typical end user. She puts up with me installing different apps on her phone, or asking her to use Service X or Y for something, but she doesn’t have a particular interest in how it all works, or what it is, as long as it does the job. So it is very pleasing that XMPP has been so painless in <em>that</em> regard too.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried using it with anyone else though, or across different servers, as there’s no-one else with whom I want to talk who also uses XMPP. I could set up my parents on it, and use XMPP instead of Signal, and this is kind of where I wish Snikket supported multiple domain names rather than needing different instances (I know, I know, there’s prosody for that…).</p>
<p>I rather like the fact that’s an Intel NUC, sitting in the rack at home, carrying all our communications, and that they are encrypted. That all appeals to me.</p>
