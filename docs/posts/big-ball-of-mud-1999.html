	<p>
		While much attention has been focused on high-level software
		architectural patterns, what is, in effect, the de-facto standard
		software architecture is seldom discussed. This paper examines this
		most frequently deployed of software architectures: the <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>. A <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> is a casually, even
		haphazardly, structured system. Its organization, if one can call it
		that, is dictated more by expediency than design. Yet, its enduring
		popularity cannot merely be indicative of a general disregard for
		architecture.
	</p>

	<p>
		These patterns explore the forces that encourage the emergence of a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>, and the undeniable
		effectiveness of this approach to software architecture. What are the
		people who build them doing right? If more high-minded architectural
		approaches are to compete, we must understand what the forces that
		lead to a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> are, and
		examine alternative ways to resolve them.
	</p>

	<p>
		A number of additional patterns emerge out of the <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>. We discuss them in
		turn. Two principal questions underlie these patterns: Why are so many
		existing systems architecturally undistinguished, and what can we do
		to improve them?
	</p>

	<p>
		Over the last several years, a number of authors [Garlan &amp; Shaw
		1993] [Shaw 1996] [Buschmann et. al. 1996] [Meszaros 1997] have
		presented patterns that characterize high-level software
		architectures, such as PIPELINE and LAYERED ARCHITECTURE. In an ideal
		world, every system would be an exemplar of one or more such
		high-level patterns. Yet, this is not so. The architecture that
		actually predominates in practice has yet to be discussed: the <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<a href="http://oak.cats.ohiou.edu/~ba116594/mmt.html"> <img src="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/images/pictures/spaghetti-medium.jpg" width="317" height="437" alt="Lennon Serves Too Much Spaghetti"/></a>
	<p>
		A <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> is haphazardly
		structured, sprawling, sloppy, duct-tape and bailing wire, <a href="http://www.mdagroup.com/computing/spaghett.htm">spaghetti</a> <a href="http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~dkw/C-humor/pasta.txt">code</a> <a href="http://leb.net/~tonyk/jargon/entry.cgi?idx=1710">jungle</a>.
		Weâ€™ve all seen them. These systems show unmistakable signs of
		unregulated growth, and repeated, <a href="http://home.swbell.net/mck9/cobol/style/rewrite.html">expedient</a>
		repair. Information is shared promiscuously among distant elements of
		the system, often to the point where nearly all the important
		information becomes global or duplicated. The overall structure of the
		system may never have been well defined. If it was, it may have <a href="http://garynorth.com/y2k/detail_.cfm/881">eroded</a> beyond
		recognition. Programmers with a shred of architectural sensibility
		shun these quagmires. Only those who are unconcerned about
		architecture, and, perhaps, are comfortable with the inertia of the
		day-to-day chore of patching the holes in these failing dikes, are
		content to work on such systems.
	</p>

	<p>Still, this approach endures and thrives. Why is this
		architecture so popular? Is it as bad as it seems, or might it serve
		as a way-station on the road to more enduring, elegant artifacts? What
		forces drive good programmers to build ugly systems? Can we avoid
		this? Should we? How can we make such systems better?</p>

	<p>We present the following seven patterns:</p>

	<p>
		Why does a system become a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>? Sometimes, big, ugly systems emerge from <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode"></a><a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY
			CODE</a>. <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a> is
		quick-and-dirty code that was intended to be used only once and then
		discarded. However, such code often takes on a life of its own,
		despite casual structure and poor or non-existent documentation. It
		works, so why fix it? When a related problem arises, the quickest way
		to address it might be to expediently modify this working code, rather
		than design a proper, general program from the ground up. Over time, a
		simple throwaway program begets a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Even systems with well-defined architectures are prone to structural
		erosion. The relentless onslaught of changing requirements that any
		successful system attracts can gradually undermine its structure.
		Systems that were once tidy become overgrown as <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> gradually allows
		elements of the system to sprawl in an uncontrolled fashion.
	</p>

	<p>
		If such sprawl continues unabated, the structure of the system can
		become so badly compromised that it must be abandoned. As with a
		decaying neighborhood, a downward spiral ensues. Since the system
		becomes harder and harder to understand, maintenance becomes more
		expensive, and more difficult. Good programmers refuse to work there.
		Investors withdraw their capital. And yet, as with neighborhoods,
		there are ways to avoid, and even reverse, this sort of decline. As
		with anything else in the universe, counteracting entropic forces
		requires an investment of energy. Software <a href="http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?gentrification">gentrification</a>
		is no exception. The way to arrest entropy in software is to refactor
		it. A sustained commitment to refactoring can keep a system from
		subsiding into a BIG BALL OF MUD.
	</p>

	<p>
		A major flood, fire, or war may require that a city be evacuated and
		rebuilt from the ground up. More often, change takes place a building
		or block at a time, while the city as a whole continues to function.
		Once established, a strategy of <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEPING
			IT WORKING</a> preserves a municipalityâ€™s vitality as it grows.
	</p>

	<p>
		Systems and their constituent elements evolve at different rates. As
		they do, things that change quickly tend to become distinct from
		things that change more slowly. The <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#ShearingLayers">SHEARING
			LAYERS</a> that develop between them are like fault lines or facets that
		help foster the emergence of enduring abstractions.
	</p>

	<p>
		A simple way to begin to control decline is to cordon off the blighted
		areas, and put an attractive façade around them. We call this strategy
		<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#SweepingItUnderTheRug">SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG</a>.
		In more advanced cases, there may be no alternative but to tear
		everything down and start over. When total <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a> becomes necessary,
		all that is left to salvage is the patterns that underlie the
		experience.
	</p>

	<p>Some of these patterns might appear at first to be antipatterns
		[Brown et al. 1998] or straw men, but they are not, at least in the
		customary sense. Instead, they seek to examine the gap between what we
		preach and what we practice.</p>

	<p>Still, some of them may strike some readers as having a schizoid
		quality about them. So, for the record, let us put our cards on the
		table. We are in favor of good architecture.</p>

	<p>Our ultimate agenda is to help drain these swamps. Where
		possible, architectural decline should be prevented, arrested, or
		reversed. We discuss ways of doing this. In severe cases,
		architectural abominations may even need to be demolished.</p>

	<p>At the same time, we seek not to cast blame upon those who must
		wallow in these mires. In part, our attitude is to &#34;hate the sin, but
		love the sinner&#34;. But, it goes beyond this. Not every backyard storage
		shack needs marble columns. There are significant forces that can
		conspire to compel architecture to take a back seat to functionality,
		particularly early in the evolution of a software artifact.
		Opportunities and insights that can allow for architectural progress
		often are present later rather than earlier in the lifecycle.</p>

	<p>A certain amount of controlled chaos is natural during
		construction, and can be tolerated, as long as you clean up after
		yourself eventually. Even beyond this though, a complex system may be
		an accurate reflection of our immature understanding of a complex
		problem. The class of systems that we can build at all may be larger
		than the class of systems we can build elegantly, at least at first. A
		somewhat ramshackle rat&#39;s nest might be a state-of-the-art
		architecture for a poorly understood domain. This should not be the
		end of the story, though. As we gain more experience in such domains,
		we should increasingly direct our energies to gleaning more enduring
		architectural abstractions from them.</p>

	<p>
		The patterns described herein are not intended to stand alone. They
		are instead set in a context that includes a number of other patterns
		that we and others have described. In particular, they are set in
		contrast to the lifecycle patterns, <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/user/cope/Patterns/Process/section38.html">PROTOTYPE</a>
		<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">PHASE</a>, <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSIONARY PHASE</a>, and
		<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION
			PHASE</a>, presented in [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote
			&amp; Opdyke 1995</a>] and [Coplien 1995], the <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/metamorphosis/metamorphosis.html#SoftwareTectonics">SOFTWARE
			TECTONICS</a> pattern in [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/metamorphosis/metamorphosis.html#SoftwareTectonics">Foote
			&amp; Yoder 1996</a>], and the framework development patterns in [<a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/~droberts/evolve.html">Roberts
			&amp; Johnson 1998</a>].
	</p>

	<p>Indeed, to a substantial extent, much of this chapter describes
		the disease, while the patterns above describe what we believe can be
		the cure: a flexible, adaptive, feedback-driven development process in
		which design and refactoring pervade the lifecycle of each artifact,
		component, and framework, within and beyond the applications that
		incubate them.</p>

	<!-- End of Pattern Header -->

	<p>
		A number of forces can conspire to drive even the most architecturally
		conscientious organizations to produce <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. These pervasive, <i>&#34;global&#34; forces</i> are
		at work in all the patterns presented. Among these forces:
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Time:</i> There may not be enough <u>time</u> to consider the <a href="http://www.longnow.org/">long-term</a> architectural
		implications of oneâ€™s design and implementation decisions. Even
		when systems have been well designed, architectural concerns often
		must yield to more pragmatic ones as a deadline starts to loom.
	</p>

	<p>
		One reason that software architectures are so often mediocre is that
		architecture frequently takes a back seat to more mundane concerns
		such as cost, time-to-market, and programmer skill. Architecture is
		often seen as a luxury or a frill, or the indulgent pursuit of
		lily-gilding compulsives who have no concern for the bottom line.
		Architecture is often treated with neglect, and even disdain. While
		such attitudes are unfortunate, they are not hard to understand.
		Architecture is a long-term concern. The concerns above have to be
		addressed if a product is not to be stillborn in the marketplace,
		while the benefits of good architecture are realized later in the
		lifecycle, as frameworks mature, and reusable black-box components
		emerge [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke
			1995</a>].
	</p>

	<p>
		Architecture can be looked upon as a <i>Risk</i>, that will consume
		resources better directed at meeting a fleeting market window, or as
		an <i>Opportunity</i> to lay the groundwork for a commanding advantage
		down the road.
	</p>

	<p>Indeed, an immature architecture can be an advantage in a
		growing system because data and functionality can migrate to their
		natural places in the system unencumbered by artificial architectural
		constraints. Premature architecture can be more dangerous than none at
		all, as unproved architectural hypotheses turn into straightjackets
		that discourage evolution and experimentation.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Cost:</i> Architecture is expensive, especially when a new domain
		is being explored. Getting the system right seems like a pointless
		luxury once the system is limping well enough to ship. An investment
		in architecture usually does not pay off immediately. Indeed, if
		architectural concerns delay a productâ€™s market entry for too
		long, then long-term concerns may be moot. Who benefits from an
		investment in architecture, and when is a return on this investment
		seen? Money spent on a quick-and-dirty project that allows an
		immediate entry into the market may be better spent than money spent
		on elaborate, speculative architectural fishing expedition. Itâ€™s
		hard to recover the value of your architectural assets if youâ€™ve
		long since gone bankrupt.
	</p>

	<p>Programmers with the ability to discern and design quality
		architectures are reputed to command a premium. These expenses must be
		weighed against those of allowing an expensive system to slip into
		premature decline and obsolescence. If you think good architecture is
		expensive, try bad architecture.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Experience:</i> Even when one has the time and inclination to take
		architectural concerns into account, oneâ€™s experience, or lack
		thereof, with the domain can limit the degree of architectural
		sophistication that can be brought to a system, particularly early in
		its evolution. Some programmers flourish in environments where they
		can discover and develop new abstractions, while others are more
		comfortable in more constrained environments (for instance, Smalltalk
		vs. <a href="http://www.hamline.edu/~wnk/cpb/199707/0884.html">Visual
			Basic</a> programmers.) Often, initial versions of a system are vehicles
		whereby programmers learn what pieces must be brought into play to
		solve a particular problem. Only after these are identified do the
		architectural boundaries among parts of the system start to emerge.
	</p>

	<p>Inexperience can take a number of guises. There is absolute,
		fresh out of school inexperience. A good architect may lack domain
		experience, or a domain expert who knows the code cold may not have
		architectural experience.</p>

	<p>Employee turnover can wreak havoc on an organizationâ€™s
		institutional memory, with the perhaps dubious consolation of bringing
		fresh blood aboard.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Skill:</i> Programmers differ in their levels of skill, as well as
		in expertise, predisposition and temperament. Some programmers have a
		passion for finding good abstractions, while some are skilled at
		navigating the swamps of complex code left to them by others.
		Programmers differ tremendously in their degrees of experience with
		particular domains, and their capacities for adapting to new ones.
		Programmers differ in their language and tool preferences and
		experience as well.
	</p>


	<p>
		<i>Visibility:</i> Buildings are tangible, physical structures. You
		can look at a building. You can watch it being built. You can walk
		inside it, and admire and critique its design.
	</p>

	<p>A programâ€™s user interface presents the public face of a
		program, much as a buildingâ€™s exterior manifests its
		architecture. However, unlike buildings, only the people who build a
		program see how it looks inside.</p>

	<p>Programs are made of bits. The manner in which we present these
		bits greatly affects our sense of how they are put together. Some
		designers prefer to see systems depicted using modeling languages or
		PowerPoint pictures. Others prefer prose descriptions. Still others
		prefer to see code. The fashion in which we present our architectures
		affects our perceptions of whether they are good or bad, clear or
		muddled, and elegant or muddy.</p>

	<p>Indeed, one of the reasons that architecture is neglected is
		that much of it is &#34;under the hood&#34;, where nobody can see
		it. If the system works, and it can be shipped, who cares what it
		looks like on the inside?</p>

	<p>
		<i>Complexity:</i> One reason for a muddled architecture is that
		software often reflects the inherent complexity of the application
		domain. This is what <a href="http://groucho.admin.unc.edu/endeavors/end496/brooks.htm">Brooks</a>
		called &#34;essential complexity&#34; [Brooks 1995]. In other words,
		the software is ugly because the problem is ugly, or at least not well
		understood. Frequently, the organization of the system reflects the
		sprawl and history of the organization that built it (as per <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/user/cope/Patterns/Process/section15.html">CONWAYâ€™S
			LAW</a> [Coplien 1995]) and the compromises that were made along the way.
		Renegotiating these relationships is often difficult once the basic
		boundaries among system elements are drawn. These relationships can
		take on the immutable character of &#34;site&#34; boundaries that <a href="http://www.well.com/user/sbb/index.html"> Brand</a> [Brand
		1994] observed in real cities. Big problems can arises when the needs
		of the applications force unrestrained communication across these
		boundaries. The system becomes a tangled mess, and what little
		structure is there can erode further.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Change:</i> Architecture is a hypothesis about the future that
		holds that subsequent change will be confined to that part of the
		design space encompassed by that architecture. Of course, the world
		has a way of mocking our attempts to make such predictions by tossing
		us the totally unexpected. A problem we might have been told was
		definitely ruled out of consideration for all time may turn out to be
		dear to the heart of a new client we never thought weâ€™d have.
		Such changes may cut directly across the grain of fundamental
		architectural decisions made in the light of the certainty that these
		new contingencies could never arise. The &#34;right&#34; thing to do
		might be to redesign the system. The more likely result is that the
		architecture of the system will be expediently perturbed to address
		the new requirements, with only passing regard for the effect of these
		radical changes on the structure of the system.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Scale:</i> Managing a large project is a qualitatively different
		problem from managing a small one, just as leading a division of
		infantry into battle is different from commanding a small special
		forces team. Obviously, &#34;divide and conquer&#34; is, in general, an
		insufficient answer to the problems posed by scale. Alan Kay, during
		an invited talk at OOPSLA &#39;86 observed that &#34;good ideas don&#39;t always
		scale.&#34; That observation prompted <a href="http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/people/lieber/">Henry
			Lieberman</a> to inquire &#34;so what do we do, just scale the bad ones?&#34;

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.interlog.com/~rodneyb/paraguay/shantypix.html">Shantytowns</a>
		are squalid, sprawling slums. Everyone seems to agree they are a bad
		idea, but forces conspire to promote their emergence anyway. What is
		it that they are doing right?
	</p>

	<p>Shantytowns are usually built from common, inexpensive materials
		and simple tools. Shantytowns can be built using relatively unskilled
		labor. Even though the labor force is &#34;unskilled&#34; in the
		customary sense, the construction and maintenance of this sort of
		housing can be quite labor intensive. There is little specialization.
		Each housing unit is constructed and maintained primarily by its
		inhabitants, and each inhabitant must be a jack of all the necessary
		trades. There is little concern for infrastructure, since
		infrastructure requires coordination and capital, and specialized
		resources, equipment, and skills. There is little overall planning or
		regulation of growth. Shantytowns emerge where there is a need for
		housing, a surplus of unskilled labor, and a dearth of capital
		investment. Shantytowns fulfill an immediate, local need for housing
		by bringing available resources to bear on the problem. Loftier
		architectural goals are a luxury that has to wait.</p>

	<p>Maintaining a shantytown is labor-intensive and requires a broad
		range of skills. One must be able to improvise repairs with the
		materials on-hand, and master tasks from roof repair to ad hoc
		sanitation. However, there is little of the sort of skilled
		specialization that one sees in a mature economy.</p>

	<p>All too many of our software systems are, architecturally,
		little more than shantytowns. Investment in tools and infrastructure
		is too often inadequate. Tools are usually primitive, and
		infrastructure such as libraries and frameworks, is undercapitalized.
		Individual portions of the system grow unchecked, and the lack of
		infrastructure and architecture allows problems in one part of the
		system to erode and pollute adjacent portions. Deadlines loom like
		monsoons, and architectural elegance seems unattainable.</p>

	<p>As a system nears completion, its actual users may begin to work
		with it for the first time. This experience may inspire changes to
		data formats and the user interface that undermine architectural
		decisions that had been thought to be settled. Also, as Brooks [Brooks
		1995] has noted, because software is so flexible, it is often asked to
		bear the burden of architectural compromises late in the development
		cycle of hardware/software deliverables precisely because of its
		flexibility.</p>

	<p>
		This phenomenon is not unique to software. <a href="http://www.well.com/user/sbb/index.html">Stewart Brand</a>
		[Brand 1994] has observed that the period just prior to a
		buildingâ€™s initial occupancy can be a stressful period for both
		architects and their clients. The money is running out, and the
		finishing touches are being put on just those parts of the space that
		will interact the most with its occupants. During this period, it can
		become evident that certain wish-list items are not going to make it,
		and that exotic experiments are not going to work. Compromise becomes
		the &#34;order of the day&#34;.
	</p>

	<p>The time and money to chase perfection are seldom available, nor
		should they be. To survive, we must do what it takes to get our
		software working and out the door on time. Indeed, if a team completes
		a project with time to spare, todayâ€™s managers are likely to take
		that as a sign to provide less time and money or fewer people the next
		time around.</p>

	<div><SPAN><b>You need to deliver quality
						software on time, and under budget.</b></SPAN></div>

	<p>
		<i>Cost</i>: Architecture is a long-term investment. It is easy for
		the people who are paying the bills to dismiss it, unless there is
		some tangible immediate benefit, such a tax write-off, or unless
		surplus money and time happens to be available. Such is seldom the
		case. More often, the customer needs something working by tomorrow.
		Often, the people who control and manage the development process
		simply do not regard architecture as a pressing concern. If
		programmers know that workmanship is invisible, and managers don&#39;t
		want to pay for it anyway, a vicious circle is born.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Skill</i>: Ralph Johnson is fond of observing that is inevitable
		that &#34;on average, average organizations will have average people&#34;. One
		reason for the popularity and success of <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> approaches might be
		that this appoach doesn&#39;t require a hyperproductive <a href="http://www.onenet.net/~njtdb/casey.html">virtuoso</a> architect
		at every keyboard.
	</p><p>
		<i>Organization</i>: With larger projects, cultural, process,
		organizational and resource allocation issues can overwhelm technical
		concerns such as tools, languages, and architecture.
	</p>

	<p>It may seem to a programmer that whether to don hip boots and
		wade into a swamp is a major quality-of-life matter, but programmer
		comfort is but one concern to a manager, which can conflict with many
		others. Architecture and code quality may strike management as frills
		that have only an indirect impact on their bottom lines.
	</p><p>
	<p><b><SPAN><u><i>Therefore</i></u>,

	</p><p>
		The case made here resembles Gabrielâ€™s &#34;<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/gabriel/worse-is-better.html">Worse is Better</a>&#34;
		arguments [Gabriel 1991] in a number of respects. Why does so much
		software, despite the best intentions and efforts of developers, turn
		into <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS OF MUD</a>? Why do
		slash-and-burn tactics drive out elegance? Does bad architecture drive
		out good architecture?
	</p>

	<p>What does this muddy code look like to the programmers in the
		trenches who must confront it? Data structures may be haphazardly
		constructed, or even next to non-existent. Everything talks to
		everything else. Every shred of important state data may be global.
		There are those who might construe this as a sort of blackboard
		approach [Buschmann 1996], but it more closely resembles a grab bag of
		undifferentiated state. Where state information is compartmentalized,
		it may be passed promiscuously about though Byzantine back channels
		that circumvent the system&#39;s original structure.</p>

	<p>Variable and function names might be uninformative, or even
		misleading. Functions themselves may make extensive use of global
		variables, as well as long lists of poorly defined parameters. The
		function themselves are lengthy and convoluted, and perform several
		unrelated tasks. Code is duplicated. The flow of control is hard to
		understand, and difficult to follow. The programmerâ€™s intent is
		next to impossible to discern. The code is simply unreadable, and
		borders on indecipherable. The code exhibits the unmistakable signs of
		patch after patch at the hands of multiple maintainers, each of whom
		barely understood the consequences of what he or she was doing. Did we
		mention documentation? What documentation?</p>

	<p>
		<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> might be thought
		of as an anti-pattern, since our intention is to show how passivity in
		the face of forces that undermine architecture can lead to a quagmire.
		However, its undeniable popularity leads to the inexorable conclusion
		that it is a pattern in its own right. It is certainly a pervasive,
		recurring solution to the problem of producing a working system in the
		context of software development. It would seem to be the path of least
		resistance when one confronts the sorts of forces discussed above.
		Only by understanding the logic of its appeal can we channel or
		counteract the forces that lead to a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>One thing that isnâ€™t the answer is rigid, totalitarian,
		top-down design. Some analysts, designers, and architects have an
		exaggerated sense of their ability to get things right up-front,
		before moving into implementation. This approach leads to inefficient
		resources utilization, analysis paralysis, and design straightjackets
		and cul-de-sacs.</p>

	<p>Kent Beck has observed that the way to build software is to:
		Make it work. Make it right. Make it fast [Beck 1997]. &#34;Make it
		work&#34; means that we should focus on functionality up-front, and
		get something running. &#34;Make it right&#34; means that we should
		concern ourselves with how to structure the system only after
		weâ€™ve figured out the pieces we need to solve the problem in the
		first place. &#34;Make it fast&#34; means that we should be
		concerned about optimizing performance only after weâ€™ve learned
		how to solve the problem, and after weâ€™ve discerned an
		architecture to elegantly encompass this functionality. Once all this
		has been done, one can consider how to make it cheap.</p>

	<p>
		When it comes to software architecture, form <u>follows</u> function.
		Here we mean &#34;follows&#34; not in the traditional sense of dictating
		function. Instead, we mean that the distinct identities of the
		system’s architectural elements often don’t start to emerge until <u>after</u>
		the code is working.
	</p>

	<p>Domain experience is an essential ingredient in any framework
		design effort. It is hard to try to follow a front-loaded, top-down
		design process under the best of circumstances. Without knowing the
		architectural demands of the domain, such an attempt is premature, if
		not foolhardy. Often, the only way to get domain experience early in
		the lifecycle is to hire someone who has worked in a domain before
		from someone else.</p>

	<p>The quality of oneâ€™s tools can influence a systemâ€™s
		architecture. If a systemâ€™s architectural goals are inadequately
		communicated among members of a team, they will be harder to take into
		account as the system is designed and constructed.</p>

	<p>
		Finally, engineers will differ in their levels of skill and commitment
		to architecture. Sadly, architecture has been undervalued for so long
		that many engineers regard life with a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a> as normal. Indeed some engineers are particularly skilled
		at learning to navigate these quagmires, and guiding others through
		them. Over time, this symbiosis between architecture and skills can
		change the character of the organization itself, as swamp guides
		become more valuable than architects. As per <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/user/cope/Patterns/Process/section15.html">CONWAYâ€™S
			LAW</a> [Coplien 1995], architects depart in futility, while engineers
		who have mastered the muddy details of the system they have built in
		their images prevail. [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/selfish/selfish.html#LowSurfaceToVolumeRatio">Foote
			&amp; Yoder 1998a</a>] went so far as to observe that inscrutable code
		might, in fact, have a survival advantage over good code, by virtue of
		being difficult to comprehend and change. This advantage can extend to
		those programmers who can find their ways around such code. In a land
		devoid of landmarks, such guides may become indispensable.
	</p>

	<p>The incentives that drive the evolution of such systems can, at
		times, operate perversely. Just as it is easier to be verbose than
		concise, it is easier to build complex systems than it is to build
		simple ones. Skilled programmers may be able to create complexity more
		quickly than their peers, and more quickly than they can document and
		explain it. Like an army outrunning its logistics train, complexity
		increases until it reaches the point where such programmers can no
		longer reliably cope with it.</p>

	<p>
		This is akin to a phenonmenon dubbed the <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?PeterPrincipleProgramming"><i>PeterPrinciple
				of Programming</i></a> by authors on the Wiki-Wiki web [Cunninghan 1999a].
		Complexity increases rapidly until the it reaches a level of
		complexity just beyond that with which programmers can comfortably
		cope. At this point, complexity and our abilities to contain it reach
		an uneasy equilibrium. The blitzkrieg bogs down into a siege. We built
		<a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheMostComplexWhichCanBeMadeToWork">
			the most complicated system that can possible work</a> [Cunningham
		1999b].
	</p>
	<a href="http://www.45thdivisionmuseum.com/Mainmuseum/Mauldin2.htm">
		<img src="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/images/pictures/mauldin-warm-mud.gif"/>
	</a>

	<p>Such code can become a personal fiefdom, since the author care
		barely understand it anymore, and no one else can come close. Once
		simple repairs become all day affairs, as the code turns to mud. It
		becomes increasingly difficult for management to tell how long such
		repairs ought to take. Simple objectives turn into trench warfare.
		Everyone becomes resigned to a turgid pace. Some even come to prefer
		it, hiding in their cozy foxholes, and making their two line-per-day
		repairs.</p>

	<p>It is interesting to ask whether some of the differences in
		productivity seen between hyper-productive organizations and typical
		shops are due not to differences in talent, but differences in
		terrain. Mud is hard to march through. The hacker in the trenches must
		engage complexity in hand-to-hand combat every day. Sometimes,
		complexity wins.</p>

	<p>Status in the programmer&#39;s primate pecking order is often earned
		through ritual displays of cleverness, rather than through
		workman-like displays of simplicity and clarity. That which a culture
		glorifies will flourish.</p>

	<p>
		Yet, a case can be made that the casual, undifferentiated structure of
		a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> is one of its
		secret advantages, since forces acting between two parts of the system
		can be directly addressed without having to worry about undermining
		the systemâ€™s grander architectural aspirations. These aspirations
		are modest ones at best in the typical <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>. Indeed, a casual approach to architecture is emblematic
		of the early phases of a systemâ€™s evolution, as programmers,
		architects and users learn their way around the domain [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">Foote &amp; Opdyke
			1995</a>]. During the <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">PROTOTYPE</a>
		and <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSIONARY
			PHASES</a> of a systems evolution, expedient, white-box inheritance-based
		code borrowing, and a relaxed approach to encapsulation are common.
		Later, as experience with the system accrues, the grain of the
		architectural domain becomes discernable, and more durable black-box
		components begin to emerge. In other words, itâ€™s okay if the
		system looks at first like a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG

	<p>
		<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> architectures
		often emerge from throw-away prototypes, or <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a>, because the
		prototype is kept, or the disposable code is never disposed of. (One
		might call these &#34;<a href="http://www.muang.com/rice/plant.html">little

	</p>

	<p>
		They also can emerge as gradual maintenance and <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> impinges upon
		the structure of a mature system. Once a system is working, a good way
		to encourage its growth is to <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEP

	<p>
		The <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Prototype">PROTOTYPE
			PHASE</a> and <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSION
			PHASE</a> patterns in [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote
			&amp; Opdyke 1995</a>] both emphasize that a period of exploration and
		experimentation is often beneficial before making enduring
		architectural commitments.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, these activities, which can undermine a system&#39;s structure
		should be interspersed with <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION
			PHASES</a> [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke
			1995</a>], during which opportunities to refactor the system to enhance
		its structure are exploited. Proponents of <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com">Extreme Programming</a> [Beck
		2000] also emphasize continuous coding and refactoring.
	</p>

	<p>
		[Brand 1994] observes that buildings with large spaces punctuated with
		regular columns had the paradoxical effect of encouraging the
		innovative reuse of space precisely <u>because</u> they <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/chaos/chaos.html"><i>constrained</i></a> the design space.
		Grandiose flights of architectural fancy werenâ€™t possible, which
		reduced the number of design alternatives that could be put on the
		table. Sometimes <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/dfc/discussion.html#O2isEasy">FREEDOM
			FROM CHOICE</a> [Foote 1988] is what we <u>really</u> want.
	</p>

	<p>One of mud&#39;s most effective enemies is sunshine. Subjecting
		convoluted code to scrutiny can set the stage for its refactoring,
		repair, and rehabilitation. Code reviews are one mechanism one can use
		to expose code to daylight.</p>

	<p>
		Another is the <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com">Extreme
			Programming</a> practice of pair programming [Beck 2000]. A pure pair
		programming approach requires that every line of code written be added
		to the system with two programmers present. One types, or &#34;drives&#34;,
		while the other &#34;rides shotgun&#34; and looks on. In contrast to
		traditional solitary software production practices, pair programming
		subjects code to immediate scrutiny, and provides a means by which
		knowledge about the system is rapidly disseminated.
	</p>

	<p>Indeed, reviews and pair programming provide programmers with
		something their work would not otherwise have: an audience. Sunlight,
		it is said is a powerful disinfectant. Pair-practices add an element
		of performance to programming. An immediate audience of one&#39;s peers
		provides immediate incentives to programmers to keep their code clear
		and comprehensible, as well as functional.</p>

	<p>
		An additional benefit of pairing is that accumulated wisdom and best
		practices can be <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/chaos/chaos.html">rapidly
			disseminated</a> throughout an organization through successive pairings.
		This is, incidentally, the same benefit that sexual reproduction
		brought to the genome.
	</p>

	<p>By contrast, if no one ever looks at code, everyone is free to
		think they are better than average at producing it. Programmers will,
		instead, respond to those relatively perverse incentives that do
		exist. Line of code metrics, design documents, and other indirect
		measurements of progress and quality can become central concerns.</p>

	<p>
		There are three ways to deal with <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. The first is to keep the system healthy.
		Conscientiously alternating periods of <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Expand">EXPANSION</a> with periods
		of <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION</a>,
		refactoring and repair can maintain, and even enhance a system&#39;s
		structure as it evolves. The second is to throw the system away and
		start over. The <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a>
		pattern explores this drastic, but frequently necessary alternative.
		The third is to simply surrender to entropy, and wallow in the mire.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since the time of Roman architect <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/vit/www/index.html">Marcus
			Vitruvius</a>, [<a href="http://www.ukans.edu/history/index/europe/ancient_rome/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/home*.html">Vitruvius
			20 B.C.</a>] architects have focused on his trinity of desirables: <i>Firmitas</i>
		(<b>strength</b>), <i>Utilitas</i> (<b>utility</b>), and <i>Venustas</i>
		(<b>beauty</b>). A <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>
		usually represents a triumph of utility over aesthetics, because
		workmanship is sacrificed for functionality. Structure and durability
		can be sacrificed as well, because an incomprehensible program defies
		attempts at maintenance. The frenzied, feature-driven &#34;bloatware&#34;
		phenomenon seen in many large consumer software products can be seen
		as evidence of designers having allowed purely utilitarian concerns to
		dominate software design.

	<p>Likewise, when you are prototyping a system, you are not usually

		Programmers are usually not domain experts, especially at first. Use

	<p>When you build a prototype, there is always the risk that

		first-hand experience with this approach to software development. For
		example, in the patterns community, two examples of quick-and-dirty
		code that have endured are the <a href="http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/plop/chili98/chili-register.html">PLoP
			online registration</a> code, and the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors">Wiki-Wiki Web</a>
		pages.
	</p>

	<p>The EuroPLoP/PLoP/UP online registration code was, in effect, a
		distributed web-based application that ran on four different machines
		on two continents. Conference information was maintained on a machine
		in St. Louis, while registration records were kept on machines in
		Illinois and Germany. The system could generate web-based reports of
		registration activity, and now even instantaneously maintaineed an
		online attendees list. It began life in 1995 as a quick-and-dirty
		collection of HTML, scavenged C demonstration code, and csh scripts.
		It was undertaken largely as an experiment in web-based form
		processing prior to PLoP â€˜95, and, like so many things on the
		Web, succeeded considerably beyond the expectations of its authors.
		Today, it is still essentially the same collection of HTML, scavenged
		C demonstration code, and csh scripts. As such, it showcases how
		quick-and-dirty code can, when successful, take on a life of its own.</p>

	<p>The original C code and scripts probably contained fewer than
		three dozen original lines of code. Many lines were cut-and-paste jobs
		that differed only in the specific text they generate, or fields that
		they check.</p>

	<p>Hereâ€™s an example of one of the scripts that generates the
		attendance report:</p>
	<SPAN face="Lucida Sans Typewriter" size="2">

		<p>
			echo &#34;&lt;H2&gt;Registrations: &lt;B&gt;&#34; `ls | wc -l`
			&#34;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;&#34;</p>
	</SPAN>

	<p>
		This script is slow and inefficient, particularly as the number of
		registrations increases, but not least among its virtues is the fact
		that it<i> works</i>. Were the number of attendees to exceed more than
		around one hundred, this script would start to perform so badly as to
		be unusable. However, since hundreds of attendees would exceed the
		physical capacity of the conference site, we knew the number of
		registrations would have been limited long before the performance of
		this script became a significant problem. So while this approach is,
		in general, a lousy way to address this problem, it is perfectly
		satisfactory within the confines of the particular purpose for which
		the script has ever actually been used. Such practical constraints are
		typical of <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a>, and
		are more often than not undocumented. For that matter, everything
		about <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#ThrowAwayCode">THROWAWAY CODE</a> is more
		often than not undocumented. When documentation exists, it is
		frequently not current, and often not accurate.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Wiki-Web <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MoreAboutMechanics">code</a>
		at <a href="http://www.c2.com">www.c2.com</a> also started as a CGI
		experiment undertaken by Ward Cunningham also succeeded beyond the
		authorâ€™s expectations. The name &#34;wiki&#34; is one of
		Wardâ€™s personal jokes, having been taken from a Hawaiian word for
		&#34;quick&#34; that the author had seen on an airport van on a
		vacation in Hawaii. Ward has subsequently used the name for a number
		of quick-and-dirty projects. The Wiki Web is unusual in that <u>any</u>
		visitor may change anything that anyone else has written
		indiscriminately. This would seem like a recipe for vandalism, but in
		practice, it has worked out well. In light of the systemâ€™s
		success, the author has subsequently undertaken additional work to
		polish it up, but the same quick-and-dirty Perl CGI core remains at
		the heart of the system.
	</p>

	<p>
		Both systems might be thought of as being on the verge of graduating
		from little balls of mud to <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. The registration systemâ€™s C code <i><a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/dfc/discussion.html#Skeletons">metastasized</a></i> from one of
		the NCSA HTTPD server demos, and still contains zombie code that
		testifies to this heritage. At each step, <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEPING IT WORKING</a> is a premiere
		consideration in deciding whether to extend or enhance the system.
		Both systems might be good candidates for <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a>, were the
		resources, interest, and audience present to justify such an
		undertaking. In the mean time, these systems, which are still
		sufficiently well suited to the particular tasks for which they were
		built, remain in service. Keeping them on the air takes far less
		energy than rewriting them. They continue to evolve, in a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL</a> fashion, a little at a
		time.
	</p>

	<p>You can ameloriate the architectural erosion that can be caused
		by quick-and-dirty code by isolating it from other parts of your
		system, in its own objects, packages, or modules. To the extent that
		such code can be quarantined, its ability to affect the integrity of
		healthy parts of a system is reduced.</p>

	<p>
		Once it becomes evident that a purportedly disposable artifact is
		going to be around for a while, one can turn one&#39;s attention to
		improving its structure, either through an iterative process of <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a>, or via a fresh
		draft, as discussed in the <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a>

		Urban planning has an <a href="http://www.architectureweek.com/2001/0822/culture_1-2.html">uneven</a>
		history of success. For instance, Washington D.C. was laid out
		according to a <a href="http://www.nbm.org/Capital/">master plan</a>
		designed by the French architect <a href="http://www.nps.gov/nama/lenfant.htm">Lâ€™Enfant</a>. The
		capitals of
		<!-- Was: http://www1.estado.com.br/english/brasil/brasili2.html -->
		Brazil (<a href="http://www.macalstr.edu/~geograph/world-urbanization/jmoersch/geography.html">Brasilia</a>)
		and Nigeria (<a href="http://cityguide.lycos.com/africa/westcentral_africa/NGAAbuja.html">Abuja</a>)
		started as paper cities as well. Other cities, such as <a href="http://www.patternlanguage.com/leveltwo/archivesframe.htm?/leveltwo/../archives/alexander1.htm">Houston</a>,
		have grown without any overarching plan to guide them. Each approach
		has its problems. For instance, the radial street plans in
		Lâ€™Enftantâ€™s master plan become awkward past a certain
		distance from the center. The lack of any plan at all, on the other
		hand, leads to a patchwork of residential, commercial, and industrial
		areas that is dictated by the capricious interaction of local forces
		such as land ownership, capital, and zoning. Since concerns such as
		recreation, shopping close to homes, and noise and pollution away from
		homes are not brought directly into the mix, they are not adequately
		addressed.
	</p>

	<p>Most cities are more like Houston than Abuja. They may begin as
		settlements, subdivisions, docks, or railway stops. Maybe people were
		drawn by gold, or lumber, access to transportation, or empty land. As
		time goes on, certain settlements achieve a critical mass, and a
		positive feedback cycle ensues. The cityâ€™s success draws
		tradesmen, merchants, doctors, and clergymen. The growing population
		is able to support infrastructure, governmental institutions, and
		police protection. These, in turn, draw more people. Different
		sections of town develop distinct identities. With few exceptions,
		(Salt Lake City comes to mind) the founders of these settlements never
		stopped to think that they were founding major cities. Their ambitions
		were usually more modest, and immediate.</p>

	<p>It has become fashionable over the last several years to take
		pot shots at the &#34;traditional&#34; waterfall process model. It may seem to
		the reader that attacking it is tantamount to flogging a dead horse.
		However, if it be a dead horse, it is a tenacious one. While the
		approach itself is seen by many as having been long since discredited,
		it has spawned a legacy of rigid, top-down, front-loaded processes and
		methodologies that endure, in various guises, to this day. We can do
		worse that examine the forces that led to its original development.</p>

	<p>
		In the days before waterfall development, programming pioneers
		employed a simple, casual, relatively undisciplined &#34;code-and-fix&#34;
		approach to software development. Given the primitive nature of the
		problems of the day, this approach was frequently effective. However,
		the result of this lack of discipline was, all too often, a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>The waterfall approach arose in response to this muddy morass.
		While the code-and-fix approach might have been suitable for small
		jobs, it did not scale well. As software became more complex, it would
		not do to simply gather a room full of programmers together and tell
		them to go forth and code. Larger projects demanded better planning
		and coordination. Why, it was asked, can&#39;t software be engineered like
		cars and bridges, with a careful analysis of the problem, and a
		detailed up-front design prior to implementation? Indeed, an
		examination of software development costs showed that problems were
		many times more expensive to fix during maintenance than during
		design. Surely it was best to mobilize resources and talent up-front,
		so as to avoid maintenance expenses down the road. It&#39;s surely wiser
		to route the plumbing correctly now, before the walls are up, than to
		tear holes in them later. Measure twice, cut once.</p>

	<p>One of the reasons that the waterfall approach was able to
		flourish a generation ago was that computers and business requirements
		changed at a more leisurely pace. Hardware was very expensive, often
		dwarfing the salaries of the programmers hired to tend it. User
		interfaces were primitive by today&#39;s standards. You could have any
		user interface you wanted, as long as it was an alphanumeric &#34;green
		screen&#34;. Another reason for the popularity of the waterfall approach
		was that it exhibited a comfortable similarity to practices in more
		mature engineering and manufacturing disciplines.</p>

	<p>Today&#39;s designers are confronted with a broad onslaught of
		changing requirements. It arises in part from the rapid growth of
		technology itself, and partially from rapid changes in the business
		climate (some of which is driven by technology). Customers are used to
		more sophisticated software these days, and demand more choice and
		flexibility. Products that were once built from the ground up by
		in-house programmers must now be integrated with third-party code and
		applications. User interfaces are complex, both externally and
		internally. Indeed, we often dedicate an entire tier of our system to
		their care and feeding. Change threatens to outpace our ability to
		cope with it.</p>

	<div><SPAN><b>Master plans are often
						rigid, misguided and out of date. Usersâ€™ needs change with
						time.</b></SPAN></div>

	<p>
		<i>Change:</i> The fundamental problem with top-down design is that
		real world requirement are inevitably moving targets. You can&#39;t simply
		aspire to solve the problem at hand once and for all, because, by the
		time you&#39;re done, the problem will have changed out from underneath
		you. You can&#39;t simply do what the customer wants, for quite often,
		they don&#39;t know what they want. You can&#39;t simply plan, you have to
		plan to be able to adapt. If you can&#39;t fully anticipate what is going
		to happen, you must be prepared to be nimble.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Aesthetics:</i> The goal of up-front design is to be able to
		discern and specify the significant architectural elements of a system
		before ground is broken for it. A superior design, given this mindset,
		is one that elegantly and completely specifies the system&#39;s structure
		before a single line of code has been written. Mismatches between
		these blueprints and reality are considered aberrations, and are
		treated as mistakes on the part of the designer. A better design would
		have anticipated these oversights. In the presence of volatile
		requirements, aspirations towards such design perfection are as vain
		as the desire for a hole-in-one on every hole.
	</p>

	<p>To avoid such embarrassment, the designer may attempt to cover
		him or herself by specifying a more complicated, and more general
		solution to certain problems, secure in the knowledge that others will
		bear the burden of constructing these artifacts. When such predictions
		about where complexity is needed are correct, they can indeed be a
		source of power and satisfaction. This is part of their allure of
		Venustas. However, sometime the anticipated contingencies never arise,
		and the designer and implementers wind up having wasted effort solving
		a problem that no one has ever actually had. Other times, not only is
		the anticipated problem never encountered, its solution introduces
		complexity in a part of the system that turns out to need to evolve in
		another direction. In such cases, speculative complexity can be an
		unnecessary obstacle to subsequent adaptation. It is ironic that the
		impulse towards elegance can be an unintended source of complexity and
		clutter instead.</p>

	<p>In its most virulent form, the desire to anticipate and head off
		change can lead to &#34;analysis paralysis&#34;, as the thickening web of
		imagined contingencies grows to the point where the design space seems
		irreconcilably constrained.</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, incrementally
					address forces that encourage change and growth. Allow
					opportunities for growth to be exploited <u>locally</u>, as they
					occur. Refactor unrelentingly.</b></p>

	<p>
		Successful software attracts a wider audience, which can, in turn,
		place a broader range of requirements on it. These new requirements
		can run against the grain of the original design. Nonetheless, they
		can frequently be addressed, but at the cost of cutting across the
		grain of existing architectural assumptions. [Foote 1988] called this
		architectural erosion <i><a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/dfc/discussion.html#Specificity">midlife generality loss</a></i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		When designers are faced with a choice between building something
		elegant from the ground up, or undermining the architecture of the
		existing system to quickly address a problem, architecture usually
		loses. Indeed, this is a natural phase in a systemâ€™s evolution [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke 1995</a>]. This
		might be thought of as <i>messy kitchen</i> phase, during which pieces
		of the system are scattered across the counter, awaiting an eventual
		cleanup. The danger is that the clean up is never done. With real
		kitchens, the board of health will eventually intervene. With
		software, alas, there is seldom any corresponding agency to police
		such squalor. Uncontrolled growth can ultimately be a malignant force.
		The result of neglecting to contain it can be a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In <i>How Buildings Learn</i>, Brand [Brand 1994] observed that what
		he called <i>High Road</i> architecture often resulted in buildings
		that were expensive and difficult to change, while vernacular, <i>Low
			Road</i> buildings like bungalows and warehouses were, paradoxically,
		much more adaptable. Brand noted that <i>Function melts form</i>, and
		low road buildings are more amenable to such change. Similarly, with
		software, you may be reluctant to desecrate another programmerâ€™s
		cathedral. Expedient changes to a low road system that exhibits no
		discernable architectural pretensions to begin with are easier to
		rationalize.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the Oregon Experiment [Brand 1994][Alexander 1988] <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/ca/ca/ca.html">Alexander</a> noted:
	</p>
	<dir>
		<i> Large-lump development is based on the idea of <b>replacement</b>.
			Piecemeal Growth is based on the idea of <b>repair</b>. â€¦
			Large-lump development is based on the fallacy that it is possible to
			build perfect buildings. Piecemeal growth is based on the healthier
			and more realistic view that mistakes are inevitable. â€¦ Unless
			money is available for repairing these mistakes, every building, once
			built, is condemned to be, to some extent unworkable. â€¦
			Piecemeal growth is based on the assumption that adaptation between
			buildings and their users is necessarily a slow and continuous
			business which cannot, under any circumstances, be achieve in a
			single leap.
		</i>
	</dir>

	<p>Alexander has noted that our mortgage and capital expenditure
		policies make large sums of money available up front, but do nothing
		to provide resources for maintenance, improvement, and evolution
		[Brand 1994][Alexander 1988]. In the software world, we deploy our
		most skilled, experienced people early in the lifecycle. Later on,
		maintenance is relegated to junior staff, when resources can be
		scarce. The so-called maintenance phase is the part of the lifecycle
		in which the price of the fiction of master planning is really paid.
		It is maintenance programmers who are called upon to bear the burden
		of coping with the ever widening divergence between fixed designs and
		a continuously changing world. If the hypothesis that architectural
		insight emerges late in the lifecycle is correct, then this practice
		should be reconsidered.</p>

	<p>
		Brand went on to observe <i>Maintenance <b>is</b> learning.
		</i>He distinguishes three levels of learning in the context of systems.
		This first is habit, where a system dutifully serves its function
		within the parameters for which it was designed. The second level
		comes into play when the system must adapt to change. Here, it usually
		must be modified, and its capacity to sustain such modification
		determines itâ€™s degree of adaptability. The third level is the
		most interesting: <i>learning to learn</i>. With buildings, adding a
		raised floor is an example. Having had to sustain a major upheaval,
		the system adapts so that subsequent adaptations will be much less
		painful.
	</p>

	<p>
		<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> can be
		undertaken in an opportunistic fashion, starting with the existing,
		living, breathing system, and working outward, a step at a time, in
		such a way as to not undermine the systemâ€™s viability. You
		enhance the program as you use it. Broad advances on all fronts are
		avoided. Instead, change is broken down into small, manageable chunks.
	</p>

	<p>
		One of the most striking things about <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL GROWTH</a> is the role
		played by <i>Feedback</i>. Herbert Simon [Simon 1969] has observed
		that few of the adaptive systems that have been forged by evolution or
		shaped by man depend on prediction as their main means of coping with
		the future. He notes that two complementary mechanisms, homeostasis,
		and retrospective feedback, are often far more effective. Homeostasis
		insulates the system from short-range fluctuations in its environment,
		while feedback mechanisms respond to long-term discrepancies between a
		system&#39;s actual and desired behavior, and adjust it accordingly.
		Alexander [Alexander 1964] has written extensively of the roles that
		homeostasis and feedback play in adaptation as well.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you can adapt quickly to change, predicting it becomes far less
		crucial. Hindsight, as Brand observes [Brand 1994] is better than
		foresight. Such rapid adaptation is the basis of one of the mantras of
		<a href="http://www.xprogramming.com">Extreme Programming</a> [Beck
		2000]: <i>You&#39;re not going to need it</i>.
	</p>

	<p>Proponents of XP (as it is called) say to pretend you are not a
		smart as you think you are, and wait until this clever idea of yours
		is actually required before you take the time to bring it into being.
		In the cases where you were right, hey, you saw it coming, and you
		know what to do. In the cases where you were wrong, you won&#39;t have
		wasted any effort solving a problem you&#39;ve never had when the design
		heads in an unanticipated direction instead.</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.xprogramming.com">Extreme Programming</a> relies
		heavily on feedback to keep requirements in sync with code, by
		emphasizing short (three week) iterations, and extensive, continuous
		consultation with users regarding design and development priorities
		throughout the development process. Extreme Programmers do not engage
		in extensive up-front planning. Instead, they produce working code as
		quickly as possible, and steer these prototypes towards what the users
		are looking for based on feedback.
	</p>

	<p>Feedback also plays a role in determining coding assignments.
		Coders who miss a deadline are assigned a different task during the
		next iteration, regardless of how close they may have been to
		completing the task. This form of feedback resembles the stern justice
		meted out by the jungle to the fruit of uncompetitive pairings.</p>

	<p>
		<a href="http://www.xprogramming.com">Extreme Programming</a> also
		emphasizes testing as an integral part of the development process.
		Tests are developed, ideally, before the code itself. Code is
		continuously tested as it is developed.
	</p>

	<p>
		There is a &#34;back-to-the-future&#34; quality to Extreme Programming. In
		many respects, it resembles the blind <i>Code and Fix</i> approach.
		The thing that distinguishes it is the central role played by feedback
		in driving the system&#39;s evolution. This evolution is abetted, in turn,
		by modern object-oriented languages and powerful refactoring tools.
	</p>

	<p>Proponents of extreme programming portray it as placing minimal
		emphasis on planning and up-front design. They rely instead on
		feedback and continuous integration. We believe that a certain amount
		of up-front planning and design is not only important, but inevitable.
		No one really goes into any project blindly. The groundwork must be
		laid, the infrastructure must be decided upon, tools must be selected,
		and a general direction must be set. A focus on a shared architectural
		vision and strategy should be established early.</p>

	<p>Unbridled, change can undermine structure. Orderly change can
		enhance it. Change can engender malignant sprawl, or healthy, orderly
		growth.</p>

		A broad consensus that objects emerge from an <i>iterative
			incremental</i> evolutionary process has formed in the object-oriented
		community over the last decade. See for instance [Booch 1994]. The <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/metamorphosis/metamorphosis.html#SoftwareTectonics">SOFTWARE
			TECTONICS</a> pattern [Foote &amp; Yoder 1996] examines how systems can
		incrementally cope with change.
	</p>

	<p>
		The biggest risk associated with <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL
			GROWTH</a> is that it will gradually erode the overall structure of the
		system, and inexorably turn it into a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALL OF MUD</a>. A strategy of <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#KeepItWorking">KEEPING
			IT WORKING</a> goes hand in hand with <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#PiecemealGrowth">PIECEMEAL
			GROWTH</a>. Both patterns emphasize acute, local concerns at the expense
		of chronic, architectural ones.
	</p>

	<p>
		To counteract these forces, a permanent commitment to <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Consolidate">CONSOLIDATION</a> and
		<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html#Table2">refactoring</a> must be
		made. It is through such a process that local and global forces are
		reconciled over time. This lifecyle perspective has been dubbed the <i><a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/frameworks/fractal.html">fractal model</a></i> [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lifecycle/lifecycle.html">Foote &amp; Opdyke 1995</a>]. To
		quote Alexander [Brand 1994][Alexander 1988]:
	</p>
	<dir>
		<i>An organic process of growth and repair must create a gradual
			sequence of changes, and these changes must be distributed evenly
			across all levels of scale. [In developing a college campus] there
			must be as much attention to the repair of detailsâ€”rooms, wings
			of buildings, windows, pathsâ€”as to the creation of brand new
			buildings. Only then can the environment be balanced both as a whole,
			and in its parts, at every moment in its history.</i>

	<p>Once a city establishes its infrastructure, it is imperative
		that it be kept working. For example, if the sewers break, and
		arenâ€™t quickly repaired, the consequences can escalate from
		merely unpleasant to genuinely life threatening. People come to expect
		that they can rely on their public utilities being available 24 hours
		per day. They (rightfully) expect to be able to demand that an outage
		be treated as an emergency.</p>

	</p>
	<p>Software can be like this. Often a business becomes dependent
		upon the data driving it. Businesses have become critically dependent
		on their software and computing infrastructures. There are numerous
		mission critical systems that must be on-the-air twenty-four hours a
		day/seven days per week. If these systems go down, inventories can not
		be checked, employees can not be paid, aircraft cannot be routed, and
		so on.</p>

	<p>
		There may be times where taking a system down for a major overhaul can
		be justified, but usually, doing so is fraught with peril. However,
		once the system is brought back up, it is difficult to tell which from
		among a large collection of modifications might have caused a new
		problem. Every change is suspect. This is why deferring such
		integration is a recipe for misery. Capers Jones [Jones 1999] reported
		that the chance that a significant change might contain a new error--a
		phenomenon he ominously referred to as a <i>Bad Fix Injection</i>--
		was about 7% in the United States. This may strike some readers as a
		low figure. Still, it&#39;s easy to see that compounding this possibility
		can lead to a situation where multiple upgrades are increasing likely
		to break a system.
	</p>

	<p><b>Maintenance needs have accumulated, but
					an overhaul is unwise, since you might break the system.</b></p>


	<p>
		<i>Workmanship:</i> Architects who live in the house they are building
		have an obvious incentive to insure that things are done properly,
		since they will directly reap the consequences when they do not. The
		idea of the architect-builder is a central theme of Alexander&#39;s work.
		Who better to resolve the forces impinging upon each design issue as
		it arises as the person who is going to have to live with these
		decisions? The architect-builder will be the direct beneficiary of his
		or her own workmanship and care. Mistakes and shortcuts will merely
		foul his or her own nest.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Dependability:</i> These days, people rely on our software
		artifacts for their very livelihoods, and even, at time, for their
		very safety. It is imperative that ill-advise changes to elements of a
		system do not drag the entire system down. Modern software systems are
		intricate, elaborate webs of interdependent elements. When an
		essential element is broken, everyone who depends on it will be
		affected. Deadlines can be missed, and tempers can flare. This problem
		is particularly acute in <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS
			OF MUD</a>, since a single failure can bring the entire system down like
		a house of cards.
	</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, do what it
					takes to maintain the software and keep it going. Keep it working.</b></p>

	<p>When you are living in the system you’re building, you have an
		acute incentive not to break anything. A plumbing outage will be a
		direct inconvenience, and hence you have a powerful reason to keep it
		brief. You are, at times, working with live wires, and must exhibit
		particular care. A major benefit of working with a live system is that
		feedback is direct, and nearly immediate.</p>

	<p>
		One of the strengths of this strategy is that modifications that break
		the system are rejected immediately. There are always a large number
		of paths forward from any point in a systemâ€™s evolution, and most
		of them lead nowhere. By immediately selecting only those that do <u>not</u>
		undermine the systemâ€™s viability, obvious dead-ends are avoided.
	</p>

	<p>
		Of course, this sort of reactive approach, that of kicking the
		nearest, meanest woolf from your door, is not necessarily globally
		optimal. Yet, by eliminating obvious wrong turns, <u>only</u> more
		insidiously incorrect paths remain. While these are always harder to
		identify and correct, they are, fortunately less numerous than those
		cases where the best immediate choice is also the best overall choice
		as well.
	</p>

	<p>It may seem that this approach only accommodates minor
		modifications. This is not necessarily so. Large new subsystems might
		be constructed off to the side, perhaps by separate teams, and
		integrated with the running system in such a way as to minimize
		distruption.</p>

	<p>Design space might be thought of as a vast, dark, largely
		unexplored forest. Useful potential paths through it might be thought
		of as encompassing working programs. The space off to the sides of
		these paths is much larger realm of non-working programs. From any
		given point, a few small steps in most directions take you from a
		working to a non-working program. From time to time, there are forks
		in the path, indicating a choice among working alternatives. In
		unexplored territory, the prudent strategy is never to stray too far
		from the path. Now, if one has a map, a shortcut through the trekless
		thicket that might save miles may be evident. Of course, pioneers, by
		definition, donâ€™t have maps. By taking small steps in any
		direction, they know that it is never more than a few steps back to a
		working system.</p>

		<SPAN face="Courier New" size="2">Some years ago, Harlan Mills

	</p>
	<p>
		The notion of <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#ShearingLayers">SHEARING LAYERS</a> is
		one of the centerpieces of Brand&#39;s <i>How Buildings Learn</i> [Brand
		1994]. Brand, in turn synthesized his ideas from a variety of sources,
		including British designer Frank Duffy, and ecologist R. V. O&#39;Neill.
	</p>
	<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/images/figures/shearing-layers.gif"> <img src="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/images/figures/shearing-small.gif" alt="Brand, Page 13"/>
	</a>

	<p>Brand quotes Duffy as saying: &#34;Our basic argument is that there
		isn&#39;t any such thing as a building. A building properly conceived is
		several layers of longevity of built components&#34;.</p>

	<p>Brand distilled Duffy&#39;s proposed layers into these six: Site,
		Structure, Skin, Services, Space Plan, and Stuff. Site is geographical
		setting. Structure is the load bearing elements, such as the
		foundation and skeleton. Skin is the exterior surface, such as siding
		and windows. Services are the circulatory and nervous systems of a
		building, such as its heating plant, wiring, and plumbing. The Space
		Plan includes walls, flooring, and ceilings. Stuff includes lamps,
		chairs, appliances, bulletin boards, and paintings.</p>

	<p>These layers change at different rates. Site, they say, is
		eternal. Structure may last from 30 to 300 years. Skin lasts for
		around 20 years, as it responds to the elements, and to the whims of
		fashion. Services succumb to wear and technical obsolescence more
		quickly, in 7 to 15 years. Commercial Space Plans may turn over every
		3 years. Stuff, is, of course, subject to unrelenting flux [Brand
		1994].</p>

		Software systems cannot stand still. Software is often called upon to
		bear the brunt of changing requirements, because, being as that it is
		made of bits, it <u>can</u> change.
	</p>

	<div><SPAN><b>Different artifacts change
						at different rates.</b></SPAN></div>

	<p>
		<i>Adaptability:</i> A system that can cope readily with a wide range
		of requirements, will, all other things being equal, have an advantage
		over one that cannot. Such a system can allow unexpected requirements
		to be met with little or no reengineering, and allow its more skilled
		customers to rapidly address novel challenges.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Stability:</i> Systems succeed by doing what they were designed to
		do as well as they can do it. They earn their niches, by bettering
		their competition along one or more dimensions such as cost, quality,
		features, and performance. See [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/lingua/lingua.html">Foote
			&amp; Roberts 1998</a>] for a discussion of the occasionally fickle nature of
		such completion. Once they have found their niche, for whatever
		reason, it is essential that short term concerns not be allowed to
		wash away the elements of the system that account for their mastery of
		their niche. Such victories are inevitably hard won, and fruits of
		such victories should not be squandered. Those parts of the system
		that do what the system does well must be protected from fads, whims,
		and other such spasms of poor judgement.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Adaptability</i> and <i>Stability</i> are forces that are in
		constant tension. On one hand, systems must be able to confront
		novelty without blinking. On the other, they should not squander their
		patrimony on spur of the moment misadventures.
	</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, factor your
					system so that artifacts that change at similar rates are together.</b></p>

	<p>
		Most interactions in a system tend to be within layers, or between
		adjacent layers. Individual layers tend to be about things that change
		at similar rates. Things that change at different rates diverge.
		Differential rates of change encourage layers to emerge. Brand notes
		as well that occupational specialties emerge along with these layers.
		The rate at which things change shapes our organizations as well. For
		instance, decorators and painters concern themselves with interiors,
		while architects dwell on site and skin. We expect to see things that
		evolve at different rates emerge as distinct concerns. This is <a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/~droberts/evolve.html#SeparateChangeable">&#34;separate
			that which changes from that which doesn&#39;t&#34;</a> [<a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/~droberts/evolve.html">Roberts
			&amp; Johnson 1998</a>] writ large.
	</p>

	<p>Can we identify such layers in software?</p>

	<p>Well, at the bottom, there are data. Things that change most
		quickly migrate into the data, since this is the aspect of software
		that is most amenable to change. Data, in turn, interact with users
		themselves, who produce and consume them.</p>

	<p>Code changes more slowly than data, and is the realm of
		programmers, analysts and designers. In object-oriented languages,
		things that will change quickly are cast as black-box polymorphic
		components. Elements that will change less often may employ white-box
		inheritance.</p>

	<p>The abstract classes and components that constitute an
		object-oriented framework change more slowly than the applications
		that are built from them. Indeed, their role is to distill what is
		common, and enduring, from among the applications that seeded the
		framework.</p>

	<p>
		As frameworks evolve, certain abstractions make their ways from
		individual applications into the frameworks and libraries that
		constitute the system&#39;s infrastructure [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/dfc/discussion.html">Foote 1988</a>]. Not all elements will
		make this journey. Not all should. Those that do are among the most
		valuable legacies of the projects that spawn them. Objects help
		shearing layers to emerge, because they provide places where more
		fine-grained chunks of code and behavior that belong together can
		coalesce.
	</p>

	<p>The Smalltalk programming language is built from a set of
		objects that have proven themselves to be of particular value to
		programmers. Languages change more slowly than frameworks. They are
		the purview of scholars and standards committees. One of the
		traditional functions of such bodies is to ensure that languages
		evolve at a suitably deliberate pace.</p>

	<p>Artifacts that evolve quickly provide a system with dynamism and
		flexibility. They allow a system to be fast on its feet in the face of
		change.</p>

	<p>Slowly evolving objects are bulwarks against change. They embody
		the wisdom that the system has accrued in its prior interactions with
		its environment. Like tenure, tradition, big corporations, and
		conservative politics, they maintain what has worked. They worked
		once, so they are kept around. They had a good idea once, so maybe
		they are a better than even bet to have another one.</p>

	<p>Wide acceptance and deployment causes resistance to change. If
		changing something will break a lot of code, there is considerable
		incentive not to change it. For example, schema reorganization in
		large enterprise databases can be an expensive and time-consuming
		process. Database designers and administrators learn to resist change
		for this reason. Separate job descriptions, and separate hardware,
		together with distinct tiers, help to make these tiers distinct.</p>

	<p>The phenomenon whereby distinct concerns emerge as distinct
		layers and tiers can be seen as well with graphical user interfaces.</p>

	<p>
		Part of the impetus behind using <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/metadata/metadata.html#Metadata">METADATA</a> [<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/metadata/metadata.html">Foote &amp; Yoder 1998b</a>] is the
		observation that pushing complexity and power into the data pushes
		that same power (and complexity) out of the realm of the programmer
		and into the realm of users themselves. Metadata are often used to
		model static facilities such as classes and schemas, in order to allow
		them to change dynamically. The effect is analogous to that seen with
		modular office furniture, which allows office workers to easily,
		quickly, and cheaply move partitions without having to enlist
		architects and contractors in the effort.
	</p>

	<p>Over time, our frameworks, abstract classes, and components come
		to embody what we&#39;ve learned about the structure of the domains for
		which they are built. More enduring insights gravitate towards the
		primary structural elements of these systems. Things which find
		themselves in flux are spun out into the data, where users can
		interact with them. Software evolution becomes like a centrifuge spun
		by change. The layers that result, over time, can come to a much truer
		accommodation with the forces that shaped them than any top-down
		agenda could have devised.</p>

	<p>
		<SPAN face="Courier New" size="2">Things that are good have a
			certain kind of structure. You can’t get that structure except
			dynamically. Period. In nature you’ve got continuous
			very-small-feedback-loop adaptation going on, which is why things get

			wasn’t for the time dimension, it wouldn’t happen. Yet here we are

	<p>By getting the dirt into a single pile beneath the carpet, you
		at least know where it is, and can move it around. Youâ€™ve still
		got a pile of dirt on your hands, but it is localized, and your guests
		canâ€™t see it. As the engineers who entombed reactor number four
		at Chernobly demonstrated, sometimes you&#39;ve got to get a lid on a
		problem before you can get serious about cleaning things up. Once the
		problem area is contained, you can decontaminate at a more leisurely
		pace.</p>

	<p>To begin to get a handle on spaghetti code, find those sections
		of it that seem less tightly coupled, and start to draw architectural
		boundaries there. Separate the global information into distinct data
		structures, and enforce communication between these enclaves using
		well-defined interfaces. Such steps can be the first ones on the road
		to re-establishing the systemâ€™s conceptual integrity, and
		discerning nascent architectural landmarks.</p>

	<p>
		Putting a fresh interface around a run down region of the system can
		be the first step on the way architectural rehabilitation. This is a
		long row to hoe, however. Distilling meaningful abstractions from a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL OF MUD</a> is a difficult and
		demand task. It requires skill, insight, and persistence. At times, <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a> may seem like the
		less painful course. Still, it is not like unscrambling an egg. As
		with rehabilitation in the real world, restoring a system to
		architectural health requires resources, as well as a sustained
		commitment on the part of the people who live there.
	</p>

	<p>The UIMX user interface builder for Unix and Motif, and the
		various Smalltalk GUI builders both provide a means for programmers to
		cordon off complexity in this fashion.</p>

	<p>Atlantaâ€™s Fulton County Stadium was built in 1966 to serve
		as the home of baseballâ€™s Atlanta Braves, and footballâ€™s
		Atlanta Falcons. In August of 1997, the stadium was demolished. Two
		factors contributed to its relatively rapid obsolescence. One was that
		the architecture of the original stadium was incapable of
		accommodating the addition of the &#34;sky-box&#34; suites that the
		spreadsheets of â€˜90s sporting economics demanded. No conceivable
		retrofit could accommodate this requirement. Addressing it meant
		starting over, from the ground up. The second was that the
		stadiumâ€™s attempt to provide a cheap, general solution to the
		problem of providing a forum for both baseball and football audiences
		compromised the needs of both. In only thirty-one years, the balance
		among these forces had shifted decidedly. The facility is being
		replaced by two new single-purpose stadia.</p>

	<p>Might there be lessons for us about unexpected requirements and
		designing general components here?</p>

	</p>

	<p>Extreme Programming [Beck 2000] had its genesis in the Chrysler
		Comprehensive Compensation project (C3). It began with a cry for help
		from a foundering project, and a decision to discard a year and a
		half&#39;s worth of work. The process they put in place after they started
		anew laid the foundation for XP, and the author&#39;s credit these
		approaches for the subsequent success of the C3 effort. However, less
		emphasis is given to value of the experience the team might have
		salvaged from their initial, unsuccessful draft. Could this first
		draft have been the unsung hero of this tale?</p>

	<div><SPAN><b>Your code has declined to
						the point where it is beyond repair, or even comprehension.</b></SPAN></div>


	<p>
		<i>Obsolescence</i>: Of course, one reason to abandon a system is that
		it is in fact technically or economically obsolete. These are distinct
		situations. A system that is no longer state-of-the-art may still sell
		well, while a technically superior system may be overwhelmed by a more
		popular competitor for non-technical reasons.
	</p>

	<p>In the realm of concrete and steel, blight is the symptom, and a
		withdrawal of capital is the cause. Of course, once this process
		begins, it can feed on itself. On the other hand, given a steady
		infusion of resources, buildings can last indefinitely. It&#39;s not
		merely entropy, but an unwillingness to counteract it, that allows
		buildings to decline. In Europe, neighborhoods have flourished for
		hundreds of years. They have avoided the boom/bust cycles that
		characterize some New World cities.</p>

	<p>
		<i>Change:</i> Even though software is a highly malleable medium, like
		Fulton County Stadium, new demands can, at times, cut across a
		systemâ€™s architectural assumptions in such a ways as to make
		accommodating them next to impossible. In such cases, a total rewrite
		might be the only answer.
	</p>


	<p>
		<i>Cost</i>: Writing-off a system can be traumatic, both to those who
		have worked on it, and to those who have paid for it. Software is
		often treated as an asset by accountants, and can be an expensive
		asset at that. Rewriting a system, of course, does not discard its
		conceptual design, or its staffâ€™s experience. If it is truly the
		case that the value of these assets is in the design experience they
		embody, then accounting practices must recognize this.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>Organization:</i> Rebuilding a system from scratch is a
		high-profile undertaking, that will demand considerable time and
		resources, which, in turn, will make high-level management support
		essential.
	</p>

	<p><b><u><i>Therefore</i></u>, throw it away
					and start over.</b></p>

	<p>Sometimes itâ€™s just easier to throw a system away, and
		start over. Examples abound. Our shelves are littered with the
		discarded carcasses of obsolete software and its documentation.
		Starting over can be seen as a defeat at the hands of the old code, or
		a victory over it.</p>
	<a href="http://www.sheridanc.on.ca/~randy/design.dir/disaster.dir/disaster.htm">
		<img src="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/images/pictures/pruitt3.jpg" alt="Pruitt-Igoe"/>
	</a>

	<p>One reason to start over might be that the previous system was
		written by people who are long gone. Doing a rewrite provides new
		personnel with a way to reestablish contact between the architecture
		and the implementation. Sometimes the only way to understand a system
		it is to write it yourself. Doing a fresh draft is a way to overcome
		neglect. Issues are revisited. A fresh draft adds vigor. You draw back
		to leap. The quagmire vanishes. The swamp is drained.</p>

	<p>Another motivation for building a new system might be that you
		feel that you&#39;ve got the experience you need to do the job properly.
		One way to have gotten this experience is to have participated at some
		level in the unsuccessful development of a previous version of the
		system.</p>

	<p>Of course, the new system is not designed in a vacuum.
		Brookâ€™s famous tar pit is excavated, and the fossils are
		examined, to see what they can tell the living. It is essential that a
		thorough post-mortem review be done of the old system, to see what it
		did well, and why it failed. Bad code can bog down a good design. A
		good design can isolate and contain bad code.</p>

	<p>
		When a system becomes a <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALL
			OF MUD</a>, its relative incomprehensibility may hasten its demise, by
		making it difficult for it to adapt. It can persist, since it resists
		change, but cannot evolve, for the same reason. Instead, its
		inscrutability, even when it is to its s hort-term benefit, sows the
		seeds of its ultimate demise.
	</p>

	<p>If this makes muddiness a frequently terminal condition, is this
		really a bad thing? Or is it a blessing that these sclerotic systems
		yield the stage to more agile successors? Certainly, the departure of
		these ramshackle relics can be a cause for celebration as well as
		sadness.</p>
	<a href="http://www.webslingerz.com/~jhoffman/chcat.html"> <img src="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/images/pictures/chcat1.gif" alt="Cheshire Cat"/>
	</a>
	<p>Discarding a system dispenses with its implementation, and
		leaves only its conceptual design behind. Only the patterns that
		underlie the system remain, grinning like a Cheshire cat. It is their
		spirits that help to shape the next implementation. With luck, these
		architectural insights will be reincarnated as genuine reusable
		artifacts in the new system, such as abstract classes and frameworks.
		It is by finding these architectural nuggets that the promise of
		objects and reuse can finally be fulfilled.</p>

	<p>
		There are alternatives to throwning your system away and starting
		over. One is to embark on a regimen of incremental refactoring, to
		glean architectural elements and discernable abstractions from the
		mire. Indeed, you can begin by looking for coarse fissures along which
		to separate parts of the system, as was suggested in <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#SweepingItUnderTheRug">SWEEPING IT UNDER THE RUG</a>.
		Of course, refactoring is more effective as a prophylactic measure
		that as a last-restort therapy. As with any edifice, it is a judgement
		call, whether to rehab or restort for the wrecking ball. Another
		alternative is to reassess whether new components and frameworks have
		come along that can replace all or part of the system. When you can
		reuse and retrofit other existing components, you can spare yourself
		the time and expense involved in rebuilding, repairing, and
		maintaining the one you have.
	</p><p>
		The United States Commerce Department defines <i>durable goods</i> as
		those that are designed to last for three years or more. This category
		traditionally applied to goods such as furniture, appliances,
		automobiles, and business machines. Ironically, as computer equipment
		is depreciating ever more quickly, it is increasingly our software
		artifacts, and not our hardware, that fulfill this criterion. Firmitas
		has come to the realm of bits and bytes.

	<p>
		In the end, software architecture is about how we distill experience
		into wisdom, and disseminate it. We think the patterns herein stand
		alongside other work regarding software architecture and evolution
		that we cited as we went along. Still, we do not consider these
		patterns to be anti-patterns. There are good reasons that good
		programmers build <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS OF MUD</a>.
		It may well be that the economics of the software world are such that
		the market moves so fast that long term architectural ambitions are
		foolhardy, and that expedient, slash-and-burn, disposable programming
		is, in fact, a state-of-the-art strategy. The success of these
		approaches, in any case, is undeniable, and seals their pattern-hood.
		People build
	</p><p>
		<a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG BALLS OF MUD</a> because they <u>work</u>.
		In many domains, they are the only things that have been shown to
		work. Indeed, they work where loftier approaches have yet to
		demonstrate that they can compete.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is not our purpose to condemn <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#BigBallOfMud">BIG
			BALLS OF MUD</a>. Casual architecture is natural during the early stages
		of a systemâ€™s evolution. The reader must surely suspect, however,
		that our hope is that we can aspire to do better. By recognizing the
		forces and pressures that lead to architectural malaise, and how and
		when they might be confronted, we hope to set the stage for the
		emergence of truly durable artifacts that can put architects in
		dominant positions for years to come. The key is to ensure that the
		system, its programmers, and, indeed the entire organization, <i>learn</i>
		about the domain, and the architectural opportunities looming within
		it, as the system grows and matures.
	</p>

	<p>
		Periods of moderate disorder are a part of the ebb and flow of
		software evolution. As a master chef tolerates a messy kitchen,
		developers must not be afraid to get a little mud on their shoes as
		they explore new territory for the first time. Architectural insight
		is not the product of master plans, but of hard won experience. The
		software architects of yesteryear had little choice other than to
		apply the lessons they learned in successive drafts of their systems,
		since <a href="https://ideasimagerystory.substack.com/p/mud.html#Reconstruction">RECONSTRUCTION</a> was often
		the only practical means they had of supplanting a mediocre system
		with a better one. Objects, frameworks, components, and refactoring
		tools provide us with another alternative. Objects present a medium
		for expressing our architectural ideas at a level between
		coarse-grained applications and components and low level code.
		Refactoring tools and techniques finally give us the means to
		cultivate these artifacts as they evolve, and capture these insights.
	</p>

	<p>
		The onion-domed <i>Church of the Intercession of the Virgin on the
			Moat</i> in Moscow is one of Russia&#39;s most famous landmarks. It was built
		by Tsar Ivan IV just outside of the Kremlin walls in 1552 to
		commemorate Russia&#39;s victory over the Tatars at Kazan. The church is
		better known by it&#39;s nickname, St. Basil&#39;s. Ivan too is better known
		by his nickname &#34;Ivan the Terrible&#34;. Legend has it that once the
		cathedral was completed, Ivan, ever true to his reputation, had the
		architects blinded, so that they could never build anything more
		beautiful. Alas, the state of software architecture today is such that
		few of us need fear for our eyesight.
