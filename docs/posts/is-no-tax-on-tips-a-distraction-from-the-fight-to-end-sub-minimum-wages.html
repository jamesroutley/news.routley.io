    <h1>Is &#39;No tax on tips&#39; a distraction from the fight to end sub-minimum wages?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><div><p><span>T</span>ipping has always been a controversial subject in the US. Imported from Europe and popularized by <a href="https://www.povertylaw.org/article/the-racist-history-behind-americas-tipping-culture/" data-link-name="in body link">some accounts</a> after the fall of slavery to reinforce racial wage disparities, the practice comes freighted with historic baggage.</p><p>Nor is it overly popular with consumers. Since the pandemic, 72% of US adults say tipping is expected in more places today than it was in 2019, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/2023/11/09/how-americans-see-recent-developments-in-tipping/" data-link-name="in body link">Pew survey</a>. Four in 10 Americans oppose the suggested tips that have been popping up on payment screens everywhere from coffee shops and dry cleaners to self-service machines in airports.</p><p>That hasn’t stopped <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump" data-link-name="in body link">Donald Trump</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kamala-harris" data-link-name="in body link">Kamala Harris</a> from putting tips at the center of their election battle. Earlier this month, in a bold move, the vice-president <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/11/nx-s1-5071144/no-tax-on-tips-campaigns-trump-harris" data-link-name="in body link">endorsed</a> a policy that the former president touted earlier this year to ban taxes on tips for service workers, as both candidates have been vying for working-class voters in the 2024 election, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/22/harris-no-tax-on-tips-nevada-trump" data-link-name="in body link">especially</a> in the swing state of Nevada.</p><figure id="7925ef74-f95d-4067-ac28-1f690ea20d3e" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&#34;richLinkIndex&#34;:3,&#34;element&#34;:{&#34;_type&#34;:&#34;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&#34;,&#34;prefix&#34;:&#34;Related: &#34;,&#34;text&#34;:&#34;No tax on tips fires up Nevada hospitality workers: ‘I want that!’&#34;,&#34;elementId&#34;:&#34;7925ef74-f95d-4067-ac28-1f690ea20d3e&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;richLink&#34;,&#34;url&#34;:&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/22/harris-no-tax-on-tips-nevada-trump&#34;},&#34;ajaxUrl&#34;:&#34;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&#34;,&#34;format&#34;:{&#34;display&#34;:2,&#34;theme&#34;:0,&#34;design&#34;:10}}"><div data-print-layout="hide" data-link-name="rich-link-3 | 3" data-component="rich-link" data-name="placeholder"></div></gu-island></figure><p>At a glance, the idea of giving a break to tipped workers is attractive – in some states the minimum wage for tipped workers is just $2.13 an hour and an alarming 14.8% of those workers <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/seven-facts-about-tipped-workers-and-the-tipped-minimum-wage/" data-link-name="in body link">live in poverty</a>. But the idea throws up many issues. Why should a low-wage worker who gets tips be treated differently to one who doesn’t? Will higher-paid workers be able to use the cut their tax bills? Harris says not, Trump is less clear.</p><p>But for some critics the “no tax on tips” proposal is most worrisome because the debate detracts from the fight to eliminate sub-minimum wages and support policies that would raise wages.</p><p>“The policy of sub-minimum wage is a way of institutionalizing low wages,” said the Rev Dr William J Barber II, president of <a href="https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/about/our-demands/" data-link-name="in body link">Repairers of the Breach </a>and the founding director of the Center for Public Theology and Public Policy at Yale Divinity School. “What happens is the people forced to work those jobs that we call essential end up being economically rejected and treated like they’re expendable.”</p><p>Barber explained that although both Harris and Trump have endorsed the policy of ending taxes on tips, there are stark differences between the candidates on economics and that poverty is a systemic issue that needs <a href="https://www.poorpeoplescampaign.org/about/our-demands/" data-link-name="in body link">broad policy solutions </a>rather than just one concession such as eliminating taxes on tips.</p><p>“[Trump] can say it all he wants. He had four years to do it and he didn’t do it. But what he did do was give greedy people a $2tn tip through tax cuts,” said Barber. “When Harris <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KamalaHarris/videos/we-choose-freedom/457114333973063/" data-link-name="in body link">launched</a> her campaign she said: I want to see a world where no child lives in poverty.”</p><p>Harris is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/08/20/kamala-harris-taxes-on-tips/" data-link-name="in body link">now considering</a> a $75,000 annual income cap on her tips policy and prohibiting tax on tips only for service and hospitality workers. Her plan would also exempt the payroll tax, which funds social security and Medicare, and tie the no-tax-on-tips policy to an increase to the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers.</p><p>Lena Simet, a senior researcher and advocate on poverty and inequality at Human Rights Watch, authored a 2022 <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/10/27/ending-us-subminimum-tipped-wages-can-reduce-poverty-and-inequality" data-link-name="in body link">report</a> on the impacts that eliminating the sub-minimum wage would have on reducing poverty and inequality. It noted that although employers are supposed to compensate workers when tips don’t make up the difference between the sub-minimum wage and minimum wage, they often ignore this mandate.</p><p>“I think there’s often a misperception that workers in service industries, tipped workers, are receiving wages far above the minimum wage or living wages due to the tips that they receive. So there’s this idea that they’re doing quite well, while in reality, of course, there are some workers who see very generous tips, but it’s not the majority of workers,” said Simet. “Without having these earnings floors in place, the minimum wage floor and calling for an increase, workers are vulnerable to exploitation and inequality in the labor market which is harmful overall for the economy.</p><p>“It doesn’t mean that workers can no longer be tipped. It just means a tip comes on top of a wage floor that would guarantee them a minimum,” added Simet. “We see many countries’ alternatives for wage floors – where this reliance of workers on tips is really not practiced – and that it’s, in fact, a win for workers. It’s also a win for customers and for consumer protection purposes. The main point is really to make employers aware of their responsibilities of providing workers with decent wages, and not allow for these huge fluctuations where workers simply don’t know how much they’re going to make on a given day.”</p><p>The Culinary Union in Nevada, has endorsed the tip tax proposal in conjunction with raising the minimum wage. The union, which represents 60,000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada, has <a href="https://m.culinaryunion226.org/news/press/statement-endorsement-of-kamala-harris-for-president-and-tim-walz-for-vice-president" data-link-name="in body link">endorsed</a> Harris for president.</p><p>“It is outrageous that over a million workers in this country are not guaranteed a fair minimum wage in 2024. Employers across the nation need to take responsibility for paying a real minimum wage and Congress must ensure it,” said Ted Pappageorge, the union’s secretary-treasurer.<strong> </strong>“Seven states - Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nevada" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Nevada</a>, Oregon and Washington - have banned the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, ensuring that these workers receive the same minimum wage as non-tipped employees.”</p><p>Nevada is a key swing state for the presidential election, and Jacky Rosen, the state’s Democratic senator, is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/15/us/politics/jacky-rosen-nevada-senate.html" data-link-name="in body link">seeking </a>to re-win her seat this year. Both she and her Republican opponent have supported the no-tax-on-tips proposals. According to recent polls, Trump still has a two-point lead over Harris in Nevada, but that gap has dwindled from a nine-point lead over Biden in May.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-17" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>Al Horsford, a Democratic state representative, and the <a href="https://x.com/Culinary226/status/1825550810924650556" data-link-name="in body link">Culinary Union</a> have <a href="https://nevadacurrent.com/2024/08/12/horsford-if-you-like-no-tax-on-tips-you-should-love-banning-subminimum-wages-for-tipped-workers/" data-link-name="in body link">supported </a>ending the sub-minimum wage.
