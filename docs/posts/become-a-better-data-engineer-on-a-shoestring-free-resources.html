    <h1>Become a better data engineer on a shoestring (free resources)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-5cb1949ebd5f4f432ad4"><div><p>A bit more than a year ago I’ve compiled an annotated list of <a href="https://www.dataengineering.academy/pipeline-data-engineering-academy-blog/become-a-data-engineer-on-a-shoestring">the best free courses and learning resources</a> that could help anyone to become a data engineer on a shoestring. We’ve received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback on it, so after a full year of running the bootcamp I sat down again and collected an other bunch of resources we’ve bumped into during the cohorts.</p><p>Experienced data scientists, ambitious data analysts, data-obsessed product managers and future-oriented computer scientist have joined Pipeline Academy in the last year with the goal of learning real data craftsmanship, aka data engineering. But even if you don’t identify as any of the above, but you’re planning to become a more well-rounded data professional, you’ve come to the right place.</p><p>Expect well-designed learning experiences that are mostly very accessible in terms of pricing, and learning outcomes that are very close to what the market demands.</p><p>Some guidance for this list:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>If you haven’t read <a href="https://www.dataengineering.academy/pipeline-data-engineering-academy-blog/become-a-data-engineer-on-a-shoestring">the first edition of our compiled list of learning materials</a>, make sure to check it out first.</p></li><li><p>There are various different formats included here (video-based courses, books, podcasts, story-based interactive coding tutorials etc.), try to identify which ones suit your learning style the best.</p></li><li><p>Don’t skip the fundamentals: using Python, SQL and the command line are essential for data engineers.</p></li><li><p>Integrate learning into your weekly schedule: try sticking to what you’ve started.</p></li><li><p>Share your experience and recommendations with others, it’s really difficult to find the right courses in the forest of mediocre Medium posts and useless certifications.</p></li></ul><h4>General</h4><p><a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/"><strong><em>The Data Engineering Podcast</em></strong></a><strong><em> and </em></strong><a href="https://www.pythonpodcast.com/"><strong><em>The Python Podcast.init</em></strong></a><em><br/></em>Outstanding podcasts of Tobias Macey on the mentioned topics.</p><p><a href="https://cal-data-eng.github.io/"><strong><em>Data Engineering, UC Berkeley, Spring 2021</em></strong></a><strong><em><br/></em></strong>University course ran by industry players with experience, although one has to reflect on the fact that data engineering does not happen in notebooks.</p><p><a href="https://technically.substack.com/archive"><strong><em>Technically</em></strong></a><strong><em><br/></em></strong>Technically sends out engaging, simple explanations of technical concepts that are useful for your day to day job and fun to read. Start with the <a href="https://technically.dev/posts/sql-for-the-rest-of-us">SQL</a> and the <a href="https://technically.dev/posts/aws-for-the-rest-of-us">AWS</a> explanations.</p><p><a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2017/12/18/explain-the-cloud-like-im-10.html"><strong><em>Explain the Cloud Like I&#39;m 10</em></strong></a><strong><em><br/></em></strong>Beginners will find the cloud explained from the basics. Little prior knowledge is assumed. You will find lots of pictures, lots of examples, and many somewhat questionable analogies in this book.</p><p><strong><em>Alex Xu: System Design Interview - An Insider&#39;s Guide<br/></em></strong>The <a href="https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Alex-Xu/dp/B08CMF2CQF">book</a> and the <a href="https://courses.systeminterview.com/courses/system-design-interview-an-insider-s-guide">course</a> will help you to think about and understand complex integrations.</p></div></div></div>
