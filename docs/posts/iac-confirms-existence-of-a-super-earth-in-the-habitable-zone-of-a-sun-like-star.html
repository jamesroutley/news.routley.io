    <h1>IAC confirms existence of a Super-earth in the habitable zone of a Sun-like Star</h1>

                        <div><p><span lang="EN-GB">The<strong> Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias</strong> (IAC) and<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong></span><a href="https://www.ull.es/"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Universidad de La Laguna</strong></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> (ULL) has confirmed the discovery of a super-Earth orbiting in the habitable zone of <strong>HD 20794</strong>, a nearby Sun-like star. This discovery, the result of over two decades of observations, opens a window to future studies of Earth-like planetary atmospheres.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">The search for planets in the habitable zone of Sun-like stars is crucial for understanding the possibility of life beyond Earth and for studying conditions similar to those that enabled the development of life on our own planet. In this context, <strong>HD 20794</strong>, a star with a slightly lower mass than the Sun and located just 20 light-years away, has always been of great scientific interest. The newly discovered planet is the third planet identified in the system, following the discovery of two super-Earths published more than a decade ago. </span></p><figure role="group">

<p><span lang="EN-GB">The name of the <strong>new planet </strong>is <strong>HD 20794</strong> <strong>d</strong> and is a super-Earth with a mass six times that of Earth, taking 647 days to complete an orbit around its star, 40 days less than Mars. This orbit places it within the habitable zone of the system, meaning it is at the right distance from its star to sustain liquid water on its surface, one of the key ingredients for life as we know it.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">It is precisely the combination of the planet&#39;s distance from its star and the proximity of the system that makes it particularly attractive, rendering it a perfect candidate for observations with the </span><a href="https://elt.eso.org/"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>ELT</strong></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">, ESO&#39;s 40-meter telescope, or future space missions by</span><a href="https://www.esa.int/"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong> ESA</strong></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> and </span><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>NASA</strong></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">. “This is the perfect type of planet for characterizing terrestrial planet atmospheres with next-generation instruments and missions”, explains <strong>Nicola Nari</strong>, a researcher at <strong>Lightbridges S.L</strong>., a doctoral student at the <strong>Universidad de La Laguna</strong> and the study&#39;s lead author, published today in </span><a href="https://www.aanda.org/"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics</strong></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">. “In fact, we know of very few similar planets”, notes <strong>Alejandro Suárez Mascareño</strong>, a researcher at the<strong> IAC</strong> and co-author of the work. “This will surely be one of the first we can study”, adds.</span></p><figure role="group">

<p><span lang="EN-GB">This discovery was made possible thanks to over 20 years of radial velocity measurements from the </span><a href="https://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/espresso.html"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>ESPRESSO</strong></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> and </span><a href="https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/lasilla/36/harps/"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>HARPS</strong></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> spectrographs, both installed at </span><a href="https://www.eso.org/public/"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>ESO</strong></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> observatories in Chile. These instruments, among the most advanced in the world, can measure the tiny variations in stellar velocity caused by the gravitational pull of planets in a system. “Very few instruments in the world can achieve the level of precision required for a discovery like this”, explains<strong> Nicola Nari</strong>.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">To go even further, the team applied sophisticated processing techniques to the spectra obtained. “We worked on data analysis for years, gradually analyzing and eliminating all possible sources of contamination”, explains<strong> Michael Cretignier</strong>, a co-author of the study and researcher at the </span><a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>University of Oxford</strong></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">. This meticulous analysis revealed the presence of a candidate signal identified in 2022. The team immediately launched a new observation campaign to confirm it. “After two years of adding new measurements, we can confirm we have a robust detection”, adds <strong>Nathan Hara</strong>, a researcher at the </span><a href="https://www.lam.fr/"><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Marseille Astrophysics Laboratory</strong></span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p><figure role="group">

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Although the planet is located in the system’s habitable zone, it is too early to say whether it could host life. Its high mass and eccentric orbit make it a very different world from ours. Unlike most planets in the Solar System, <strong>HD 20794</strong> <strong>d’s </strong>orbit is not circular but elliptical. Its distance from its star changes significantly, causing the planet to move from the outer edge of the habitable zone to the inner edge throughout its year. “<strong>HD 20794</strong> <strong>d</strong> is not a second home for humanity, but its position and peculiar orbit give us a unique opportunity to study how the conditions for habitability vary over time and how these variations may influence the evolution of the planet’s atmosphere”, says <strong>Alejandro Suárez Mascareño</strong>, researcher at the <strong>IAC</strong> and co-author of the work.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">Researchers from the <strong>IAC</strong>, including<strong> Jonay I.
