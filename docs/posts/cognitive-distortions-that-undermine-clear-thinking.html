    <h1>Cognitive Distortions That Undermine Clear Thinking</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <div>

      <p><em>Leaders are paid to think clearly. And a big impediment to clear thinking is what CBT/REBT calls Cognitive Distortions: errors in thinking or thinking traps we commonly fall for. Most high-performers are not pathological, but instead fall for them when upset or in high-stress situations.</em></p><p><em> In this post, I share 17 of the most common cognitive distortions. I highlight the use-cases of leaders and job-hunters, what causes them, and strategies for countering them.</em></p><hr/><h2 id="what-are-cognitive-distortions">What are cognitive distortions?</h2><p>Also known as thinking errors or thought traps, cognitive distortions are defined as &#34;<em>errors of processing in which the person cognitively focuses on insufficient or inappropriate data and draws illogical conclusions, makes inaccurate inferences or bases predicted outcomes upon little or no empirical evidence</em>.&#34; [3]</p><p>Put simply, these are habitual but unhelpful ways of thinking. Why are they important? </p><p>Because the way we feel, and how well we operate, are directly dependent on the quality of our thinking. It&#39;s not external events or others that make us feel a certain way, but instead our thoughts about them. But this process is so fast and automatic that <strong>we forget our own role in creating these problems</strong>.  </p><blockquote>Your emotions result entirely from the way you look at things. It is an obvious neurological fact that before you can experience any event, you must process it with your mind and give it meaning. You must understand what is happening to you before you can feel it. </blockquote><h3 id="are-cognitive-distortions-applicable-to-leadership-coaching"><strong>Are cognitive distortions applicable to leadership coaching</strong></h3><p>In leadership, staying alert to cognitive distortions is important from two key perspectives : the leader&#39;s performance, and more importantly, how it affects others.</p><p>Elite athletes have to train constantly to maintain peak physical and mental conditioning. Their training routines focus on maintaining correct form. The equivalent of good form in leadership is clear thinking. Most high-functioning folks are not necessarily pathological, but nevertheless fall for these subtle but hidden patterns. </p><p>Additionally, leadership behavior has ripple-effects throughout the organization. <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/why-people-copy-leaders-complexity-view/" rel="noreferrer">People not only copy leaders</a>, but also seek answers from them, both direct and implied. Whether by design or accident, <a href="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/mastery-of-context-in-leadership/" rel="noreferrer">leaders are always setting the context</a> for their teams. It&#39;s why they simply cannot afford to get derailed by thought traps.</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>A caveat: </strong></b>When going through this list and the examples, it&#39;s easy to dismiss them as simplistic and extreme. And they mostly are. However, most of us fall for them in subtle ways that often go undetected. </p></div><h2 id="common-cognitive-distortions">Common cognitive distortions</h2><p>Just as exercise improves physical strength, there are practices to improve mental conditioning — aka clear thinking. One such practice is to learn, identify, and interrupt common but unhelpful thinking patterns that we fall for.</p><p>Coaching borrows from a range of disciplines including cognitive behavioral methods. What follows are the most common cognitive distortions that CBT/REBT recognizes.</p><p>Each cognitive distortion is followed by examples from the perspective of a job-hunter and a leader. Why? Thinking errors are most likely when operating in high-stress situations which are rich territory for thought traps.</p><figure><img src="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/content/images/2023/12/Cognitive-Distortions--lr-2.png" alt="17 Cognitive Distortions from CBT and REBT" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="1950" srcset="https://www.leadingsapiens.com/content/images/size/w600/2023/12/Cognitive-Distortions--lr-2.png 600w, https://www.leadingsapiens.com/content/images/size/w1000/2023/12/Cognitive-Distortions--lr-2.png 1000w, https://www.leadingsapiens.com/content/images/2023/12/Cognitive-Distortions--lr-2.png 1080w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"/></figure><h3 id="1-all-or-nothing-thinking">(1) All-or-Nothing Thinking</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="2-overgeneralization">(2) Overgeneralization</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="3-mental-filtering">(3) Mental filtering</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="4-disqualifying-the-positive">(4) Disqualifying the positive</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="5-jumping-to-conclusions">(5) Jumping to Conclusions</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="6-magnification-catastrophizing-or-minimization">(6) Magnification (Catastrophizing) Or Minimization</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="7-emotional-reasoning">(7) Emotional Reasoning</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="8-should-statements">(8) Should Statements</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="9-labeling-and-mislabeling">(9) Labeling and Mislabeling</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="10-personalization">(10) Personalization</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="11-mind-reading">(11) Mind-reading</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="12-fortune-teller-error">(12) Fortune-teller error</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="13-alwaysnever-thinking">(13) Always/Never Thinking</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="14-entitlement">(14) Entitlement</h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="15-outsourcing-happiness">(15) <strong>Outsourcing Happiness</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="16-control-fallacy">(16) <strong>Control Fallacy</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p><h3 id="17-fairness-fallacy">(17) <strong>Fairness Fallacy</strong></h3><p><strong>Definition</strong></p><p><strong>Examples</strong></p><p><strong>How to counter</strong></p>

<h2 id="what-causes-cognitive-distortions"><strong>What causes Cognitive Distortions?</strong></h2><p>While recognizing and countering cognitive distortions is useful, it&#39;s also valuable to go further upstream and understand what causes them to begin with. REBT has two constructs that explain what causes distortions: levels of cognitions and irrational beliefs. </p><h3 id="a-levels-of-cognitions">(a) Levels of cognitions</h3><p>REBT postulates that our disturbed mental states and unhelpful emotions follow from thinking that happens at three levels [6].</p><ol><li><strong>First level</strong>: perceptions, automatic thoughts, and negative attributions (inferential)<ol><li>This is the level at which cognitive distortions occur. It&#39;s what we&#39;re aware of and that forms our stream of consciousness. These thoughts are inferential in nature. Eg. &#34;He didn&#39;t like my work&#34;/&#34;I fail at everything&#34;/&#34;I am stupid&#34;. Because they&#39;re inferences, they can be tested. </li></ol></li><li><strong>Second level</strong>: awfulizing, global evaluations, and frustration intolerance (evaluative), that are derived from the third level.<ol><li>They evaluate the importance of the inferences: the badness of the inference(awfulizing), evaluation of your ability to tolerate the situation (frustration intolerance), or worth of person involved (global evaluations).</li></ol></li><li><strong>Third level</strong>: the core irrational belief of &#34;demandingness&#34; from which everything else follows. (imperative/schematic)<ol><li>Also known as &#34;imperative demands&#34; , these are thoughts about the way reality &#34;should&#34; be. They are core beliefs that follow the construct of &#34; I must&#34;, &#34;you must&#34;, or &#34;the world must&#34;. Albert Ellis calls this MUSTerbation — expectations about the way the world is, ought to be, and what is good or bad about what is/ought to be. Words like &#34;should&#34;, &#34;ought&#34;, &#34;must&#34; and &#34;have to&#34; represent demandingness.</li></ol></li></ol><h3 id="b-types-of-irrational-beliefs">(b) Types of irrational beliefs</h3><p>REBT recognizes 5 basic types of irrational beliefs that underlie cognitive distortions: <em>demandingness, awfulizing, frustration intolerance, self-worth ratings, and other-worth ratings</em>. </p><blockquote><em><strong>Demandingness</strong> is an unrealistic and absolute expectation of events or individuals being the way a person desires them to be. </em></blockquote><p>The most common situations where we use these irrational belief processes happen in these contexts: <em>social relationships, achievement, comfort, and fairness</em>.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-this-list-of-cognitive-distortions">How to use this list of Cognitive Distortions</h2><p>The key is to understand that thought patterns are akin to muscle movements.</p><p>Habitual ways of thinking have an evolutionary purpose — they help our brains use less energy, draw conclusions faster, and move on with our lives. We get used to a certain way of doing (in this case thinking), and the only way to change/improve is to do it differently, and getting the new “movement” into muscle memory. In this case, your neural pathways.</p><p>But to do that, you have to first recognize them. We cannot improve something we don’t notice. Identifying the usual suspects beforehand helps raise our level of awareness, which in turn helps in disrupting habitual patterns.</p><p>⦿ Familiarize yourself with the common ones.</p><p>Reading about them raises awareness, but changes are not sustained without practice.</p><p>In addition to the specific countering of cognitive distortions, below are some general approaches you can use to improve your thinking and avoid these thought traps.</p><h3 id="thought-record-journals">Thought record journals</h3><p>Writing down your thoughts and identifying what distortion you might be falling for is super helpful. Done consistently, this practice in itself can literally rewire your neural system.</p><h3 id="self-compassion">Self-Compassion</h3><p>If you were advising your friend in a similar situation, what might you tell them? We&#39;re often much harsher on ourselves than with others.</p><h3 id="relative-thinking">Relative thinking</h3><p>Learn to recognize the complexity of problems and situations and how your take might be too simplistic. Extreme interpretations require extreme simplification.</p><h3 id="scientific-thinking">Scientific thinking</h3><p>Always be searching for evidence. Test out your interpretations and get feedback from multiple sources.</p><h3 id="watch-out-for-emotive-language">Watch out for emotive language</h3><p>Be extra alert to “musts”, “should”, “oughts”, “have to’s”, “it’s awful”, “I can’t stand it”, “never”, and so on.</p><h3 id="identify-your-level-of-thinking">Identify your level of thinking</h3><p>Follow the chain of inferences down the levels of thinking and identify what irrational belief  might be driving your distortion. Another useful tool is the ladder of inference.</p><h3 id="cost-benefit-analysis">Cost-benefit analysis</h3><p>Is your particular approach or way of thinking helpful or harmful?
