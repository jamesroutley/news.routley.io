    <h1>Do open source licences cover the Ship of Theseus?</h1>

<p>I recently downloaded a single-page HTML template for a project I was working on. I wanted a good-looking scaffold to help me getting running quickly. The code had an attribution licence which I was happy to comply with.</p><p>I ended up removing about a whole bunch of the HTML that I didn&#39;t need. That also allowed me to remove the majority of the CSS which was unused. I deleted all the JavaScript. I added some semantic markup and updated a few of the outdated coding conventions. Newer CSS was also added to support modern features. And I replaced all the default images and fonts with something I preferred.</p><p>In total, 75% of the HTML was rewritten and 61% of the CSS had changed.</p><p><img decoding="async" src="https://shkspr.mobi/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Changed-fs8.png" alt="Screenshot from GitLab showing 2 files with 167 additions and 562 deletions." width="811" height="252"/></p><p>Is there enough of the original files left to warrant attribution according to the licence terms?</p><p>Let&#39;s take it to an extreme. Suppose I <em>really</em> loved the background colour used by a piece of free software. If all I copied was<a href="https://botsin.space/@colours/110484298347104112"><code>body { background: #6082B6; }</code></a> would that require attribution?</p><p>I think there&#39;s a reasonable argument that <a href="https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/legal/glossary/de-minimis"><i lang="la">de minimis non curat lex</i></a> - the law cares not for small things. Is anyone <em>seriously</em> going to argue that I stole half a dozen bytes? Could they prove that I copied that single line from them? Would anyone care?</p><p>And yet, morally, I feel that I <em>should</em> give credit.</p><p>Much like the apocryphal sculptor, <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/06/22/chip-away/">I have removed everything that wasn&#39;t necessary</a>. But I think the poor sod who lugged the block of marble deserves acknowledgment.</p><p>At what point do you say &#34;this has changed so much that it is no longer necessary to abide by the original licence&#34;?</p></div></article></div>
