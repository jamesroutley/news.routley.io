In Japan, tattoos are part of a broader subculture called </span><em><span>irezumi</span></em><span>, an intricate form of body art with its own set of unique designs, imagery, and symbolism. These elaborate tattoos often cover large parts of the body, with some resulting in full “bodysuits,” a tradition that is frequently linked with the </span><em><span>yakuza</span></em><span>—Japan’s organised crime syndicates.</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-0sehn456"><span><span>But while many viewed </span><em><span>irezumi</span></em><span> as a criminal mark or a cultural statement, one man saw these tattoos as something much more fascinating: scientific specimens. That man was Dr Fukushi Masaichi, a Japanese pathologist who embarked on an unusual mission to preserve human tattooed skin for medical research. His life&#39;s work would later be continued by his son, Dr Fukushi Katsunari, who helped preserve the tattoo legacy and ensure that the art lived on after death.</span></span></p><div data-breakout="normal"><div id="viewer-fs1cd"><div><figure role="button" data-hook="imageViewer" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="true"><div id="fs1cd"><wow-image id="d5cc5f_fe3ef64154fa4028935dfca1e049fb27~mv2.jpg" data-image-info="{&#34;containerId&#34;:&#34;fs1cd&#34;,&#34;displayMode&#34;:&#34;fill&#34;,&#34;isLQIP&#34;:false,&#34;isSEOBot&#34;:true,&#34;imageData&#34;:{&#34;width&#34;:700,&#34;height&#34;:833,&#34;uri&#34;:&#34;d5cc5f_fe3ef64154fa4028935dfca1e049fb27~mv2.jpg&#34;,&#34;name&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;displayMode&#34;:&#34;fill&#34;}}" data-bg-effect-name="" data-has-ssr-src=""><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d5cc5f_fe3ef64154fa4028935dfca1e049fb27~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_700,h_833,al_c,q_85,enc_auto/d5cc5f_fe3ef64154fa4028935dfca1e049fb27~mv2.jpg" alt="" data-pin-url="https://www.dannydutch.com/post/doctor-fukushi-masaichi-and-the-art-of-preserving-tattooed-skin" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d5cc5f_fe3ef64154fa4028935dfca1e049fb27~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_700,h_833,al_c,q_85/d5cc5f_fe3ef64154fa4028935dfca1e049fb27~mv2.jpg"/></wow-image></div></figure></div></div></div><p data-breakout="normal"><h3 dir="auto" id="viewer-deozz512"><span><span>Early Life and Medical Career</span></span></h3></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-5px2l514"><span><span>Dr Fukushi Masaichi was born in 1878 and demonstrated an early interest in the medical sciences. He pursued his education at the prestigious Tokyo Imperial University of Medicine, where he developed a strong foundation in pathology. Not content with the knowledge he gained in Japan, Masaichi travelled to Germany to further his studies in one of Europe’s medical hubs. On his return to Japan, he made significant strides in his field, eventually founding the Japanese Pathological Society.</span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-60gry516"><span><span>Masaichi’s early medical research focused on the study of syphilis, particularly its effects on the body’s cardiovascular system, such as syphilitic aortitis. He also explored diseases of the thyroid. </span></span></p><p dir="auto" id="viewer-2xgr3571"><span><span>However, his medical career took a rather macabre turn after a discovery that would change the course of his life. While studying the effects of syphilis on the skin, Masaichi observed that tattoo ink seemed to prevent scarring from the disease. Intrigued by the way ink interacted with human skin, Masaichi shifted his focus from diseases to tattoos.</span></span></p><div data-breakout="normal"><div id="viewer-avujo"><div><figure role="button" data-hook="imageViewer" tabindex="0" aria-haspopup="true"><div id="avujo"><wow-image id="d5cc5f_e874f7acb32b4dc9959af3cb7874198a~mv2.jpg" data-image-info="{&#34;containerId&#34;:&#34;avujo&#34;,&#34;displayMode&#34;:&#34;fill&#34;,&#34;isLQIP&#34;:false,&#34;isSEOBot&#34;:true,&#34;imageData&#34;:{&#34;width&#34;:420,&#34;height&#34;:614,&#34;uri&#34;:&#34;d5cc5f_e874f7acb32b4dc9959af3cb7874198a~mv2.jpg&#34;,&#34;name&#34;:&#34;&#34;,&#34;displayMode&#34;:&#34;fill&#34;}}" data-bg-effect-name="" data-has-ssr-src=""><img src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d5cc5f_e874f7acb32b4dc9959af3cb7874198a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_420,h_614,al_c,q_80,enc_auto/d5cc5f_e874f7acb32b4dc9959af3cb7874198a~mv2.jpg" alt="" data-pin-url="https://www.dannydutch.com/post/doctor-fukushi-masaichi-and-the-art-of-preserving-tattooed-skin" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/d5cc5f_e874f7acb32b4dc9959af3cb7874198a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_504,h_737,al_c,lg_1,q_85/d5cc5f_e874f7acb32b4dc9959af3cb7874198a~mv2.jpg"/></wow-image></div></figure></div></div></div><p dir="auto" id="viewer-vpbb"><span><span>Thus began his fascination with </span><em><span>irezumi</span></em><span>—particularly the intricate full-body tattoos, or bodysuits, that were common among Japan’s working-class communities and the </span><em><span>yakuza</span></em><span>.
