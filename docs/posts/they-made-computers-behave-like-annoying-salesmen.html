    <h1>They made computers behave like annoying salesmen</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>Computers are precise machines. You can give a computer a precise command using an inhumane language, and it should perfome the command. It&#39;s not a human, and there is no point of treating it as one. The goal of humanizing user experience isn&#39;t to create an illusion of human interaction - it&#39;s to make these mechanical commands more accessible while preserving their precise, deterministic nature. </p>
<p>UX designers and product managers of tech companies did a lot of damange to people&#39;s understanding of computers by making the software behave like a human; or to be more precise, behave like an annoying salesman. </p>

<p>We&#39;re all familiar with this type. After receiving a clear &#34;no thanks&#34; they deploy increasingly manipulative tactics to meet their &#34;always-be-closing&#34; quotas: &#34;Would this Wednesday work better?&#34; &#34;What would change your mind?&#34; This behavior is frustrating enough from actual salespeople - it&#39;s even worse when programmed into our software.</p>

<p>Personally, I can tolerate but deeply dislike software that pretends to have ulterior motives. Take YouTube, for instance. When I explicitly say &#34;Not interested&#34; to their damned shorts feature, I get this response:</p>
<p><img src="https://img.exotext.com/1/BRKRAYhSqywqHunBgXt0P.png" alt="youtube web page with a message saying &#39;shelf will be hidden for 30 days&#39;"/></p>
<p>I understand that it&#39;s not the &#34;YouTube program&#34; having its own agency and making this decision - it&#39;s the team behind it, driven by engagement metrics and growth targets. But does the average user understand this distinction?</p>
<p>The population (especially the younger generation, who never seen a different kind of technology at all) is being conditioned by the tech industry to accept that software should behave like an unreliable, manipulative human rather than a precise, predictable machine. They&#39;re learning that you can&#39;t simply tell a computer &#34;I&#39;m not interested&#34; and expect it to respect that choice. Instead, you must engage in a perpetual dance of &#34;not now, please&#34; - only to face the same prompts again and again.</p>
