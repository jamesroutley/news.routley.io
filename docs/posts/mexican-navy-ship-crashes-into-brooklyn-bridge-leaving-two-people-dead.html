    <h1>Mexican Navy ship crashes into Brooklyn Bridge leaving two people dead</h1>

The ministry of the navy, with the support of local authorities, is currently attending to the wounded.”</p><p>A Mexican <a href="https://www.gob.mx/semar/prensa/la-secretaria-de-marina-informa-sobre-los-hechos-ocurridos-con-el-buque-escuela-velero-cuauhtemoc?idiom=es" data-link-name="in body link">government bulletin</a> said 22 crew members were injured, 11 of them critically, with nine in a stable condition.

Nobody was reported injured on the bridge, which was undamaged, said Eric Adams, the mayor of New York City, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NYCMayor/posts/pfbid02pZzWkEVvQpnebCuW7W7YNrVUaR2dZfNGZEo37FMhJedpvzvEteaaJiamAEKY86m8l?__cft__[0]=AZXo-JFYY3Jt6RxrdPpvEDcZRiOb6MfB5QWjVFaQWOO7IUSJEZ8f8EO6zEGjwOK7Dq4Y_MnAqL2e83DjcB19OhQu-JH7YYqLCgI7Wj1cukYH5Bvf_d5cePfbjb7QD3IhUPL4X6sMEjtD__qUvMYKUf4PIyzZ8jIPx-bmRzUisZeeYw&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R" data-link-name="in body link">in a Facebook post</a>.</p><p>An earlier statement <a href="https://www.gob.mx/semar/prensa/por-la-exaltacion-del-espiritu-marinero-zarpa-el-buque-escuela-cuauhtemoc-para-iniciar-el-crucero-de-instruccion-consolidacion-de-la-independencia-de-mexico-2025?idiom=es" data-link-name="in body link">posted by the Mexican navy</a> said the Cuauhtémoc would be prevented from continuing its scheduled 254-day voyage. It was taking part in an ongoing celebration of the 200th anniversary of the independence of Mexico – achieved from Spain in 1821 – and was to have visited 22 ports in 15 countries to “carry the message of peace and goodwill of the Mexican people to the seas and ports of the world”.</p><p>It sailed from Acapulco on Mexico’s Pacific coast on 6 April and was due to make stops in a succession of countries around the Caribbean before crossing the Atlantic to Europe, including stopovers in Aberdeen and London.</p><p>Its crew consisted of 64 women and 213 men.</p><p>Sydney Neidell and Lily Katz told the Associated Press they were sitting outside to watch the sunset when they saw the vessel strike the bridge and one of its masts snap. </p><p>The Brooklyn Bridge, which opened in 1883, has a nearly 1,600-foot (490 metres) main span that is supported by two masonry towers. More than 100,000 vehicles and an estimated 32,000 pedestrians cross every day, according to the city’s transportation department, and its walkway is a major tourist attraction.</p><p>The Cuauhtémoc – about 297 feet long and 40 feet wide (90.5 metres long and 12 metres wide), according to the Mexican navy – sailed for the first time in 1982. Each year it sets out at the end of classes at the naval military school to finish cadets’ training.</p><ul>
