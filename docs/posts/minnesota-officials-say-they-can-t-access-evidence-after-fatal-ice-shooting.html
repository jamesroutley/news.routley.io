                    <p>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The head of Minnesota&#39;s state investigations agency says the U.S. attorney&#39;s office has cut off its access in the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis woman by an ICE agent.</p>

<p>&#34;The investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation,&#34; Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.</p>
<p>It had been decided that the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension would investigate Good&#39;s shooting death along with the FBI, but that later was changed by the U.S. Attorney&#39;s office, according to Evans.</p>
<p>The BCA &#34;has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation,&#34; Evans wrote.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p>
