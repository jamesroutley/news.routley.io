A video of one of the mushroom-controlled robots shows it moving slowly across a surface by pumping its robotic legs. Another biohybrid robot uses a wheeled system in order to move around.</p><p>Combining this mobility with the fungi’s ability to sense chemical and biological signals could prove useful in a range of applications, according to the researchers.</p><p>“By growing mycelium into the electronics of a robot, we were able to allow the biohybrid machine to sense and respond to the environment,” said Rob Shepherd, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Cornell.</p><p>“The potential for future robots could be to sense soil chemistry in row crops and decide when to add more fertiliser, for example, perhaps mitigating downstream effects of agriculture like harmful algal blooms.”</p><p>Details of the biohybrid robot were published in the journal <em>Science Robotics</em>, in <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adk8019">a study</a> titled ‘Sensorimotor control of robots mediated by electro-physiological measurements of fungal mycelia’.</p><p>It is not the first time a living organism has been placed inside a robot body, though the use of mushrooms could offer a major breakthrough in the field of biohybrid robotics due to their ability to grow and survive in harsh conditions.</p><p>Previous experiments have included <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/lego-robot-controlled-by-artificial-worm-brain-developed-by-openworm-project-1485174">an artificial worm brain placed inside a Lego robot</a>, which was able to recreate the creature’s movements and intentions.</p><p>Earlier this year, researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) created a machine that was integrated with living muscle tissue in order to sense and adapt to its environment.</p></div></div>
