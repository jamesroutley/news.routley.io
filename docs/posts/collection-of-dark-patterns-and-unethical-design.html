                            <p>What&#39;s a Bait and switch? This tactic lures users with an enticing offer, only to change the terms unexpectedly. The original promise often has hidden conditions, misleading users into commitments they didn&#39;t intend, eroding trust.</p>

                            <p>What is nagging? Nagging by apps and websites uses users&#39; time and attention with constant interruptions. Over time, this pressure can make users give in to these requests, even if it&#39;s not in their best interest.</p>

                            <p>What&#39;s a Roach Motel? This dark pattern is usually used for subscription services. It is easy to sign up for it, but it&#39;s much harder to cancel it (i.e. you have to call customer support).</p>

                            <p>What&#39;s a Sneak into Basket? When buying something, during your checkout, a website adds some additional items to your cart, making you take the action of removing it from your cart.</p>
