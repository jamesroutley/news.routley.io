<div><h3>Archaeologists have discovered a fragment of a soldier’s wrist purse at the site of a temporary Roman camp in South Moravia, Czech Republic.</h3>
<p>The camp was established by the 10th Legion, who was stationed in the area between AD 172 and 180 during the Marcomannic Wars, a campaign against the Germanic Marcomanni, the Quadi, and the Sarmatian Iazyges.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span>

<p>The find is especially significant because it was uncovered outside the traditional boundaries of the Roman Empire. “It is quite like a small moneybox,” explains Balázs Komoróczy of the Czech Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>“It was held on the arm or forearm, where tension closed and held it tight.” The design indicates that it would be worn on the left arm, leaving the right hand free for fighting.</p>
<p>No coins were found inside the purse itself, but a large quantity of Roman coinage was found from the same archaeological context. Experts suggest that the purse could hold as much as 50 silver denarii, just short of a yearly salary for a Roman legionary.</p>
<p>The bronze purse likely held soldiers’ private funds and “service cash,” which was used to finance operational expenses such as rations and equipment. Its discovery not only testifies to the logistical complexity of Roman army campaigns but also presents a tangible glimpse into soldiers’ existence on the empire’s frontier in transition.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span>

<p>The purse is currently on display at the Pasohlávky-based Mušov Visitor Centre, where visitors can view the fragment, a highly detailed reconstruction, and part of the coins found in the nearby context.</p>
