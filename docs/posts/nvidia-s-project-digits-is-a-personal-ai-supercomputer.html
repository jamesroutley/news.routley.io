<p id="speakable-summary">At <a href="https://techcrunch.com/storyline/live-updates-ces-2025-nvidia-samsung-sony-toyota-reveals-plus-more/">CES 2025 in Las Vegas</a>, Nvidia <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/23/nvidias-ces-2025-keynote-how-to-watch/">unveiled</a> Project Digits, a “personal AI supercomputer” that provides access to the company’s Grace Blackwell hardware platform in a compact form factor.</p>

<p>“[Project Digits] runs the entire Nvidia AI stack — all of Nvidia software runs on this,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said onstage during a press conference on Monday. “It’s a cloud computing platform that sits on your desk … It’s even a workstation, if you like it to be.”</p>







<p>Designed for AI researchers, data scientists, and students, Project Digits packs Nvidia’s new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip, which delivers up to a petaflop of computing performance for prototyping, fine-tuning, and running AI models. </p>

<p>Nvidia claims a single Project Digits unit can run models up to 200 billion parameters in size. Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters.</p>

<p>The GB10, which was developed in partnership with MediaTek, features an Nvidia Blackwell GPU connected to a 20-core Nvidia Grace CPU. Inside the Project Digits enclosure, the chips are hooked up to a 128GB pool of memory and up to 4TB of flash storage.</p>

<p>Nvidia says that two Project Digits machines can be linked together to run up to 405-billion-parameter models, if a job calls for it. Project Digits can deliver a standalone experience, as alluded to earlier, or connect to a primary Windows or Mac PC.</p>

<p>But it’s not cheap. Project Digits machines, which run Nvidia’s Linux-based DGX OS, will be available starting in May from “top partners” for $3,000, the company said. </p>


<p>So it won’t be just anyone who can afford a Project Digits unit of their own. Huang thinks that there’s a market, however.</p>

<p>“With Project Digits, the Grace Blackwell Superchip comes to millions of developers,” he said in a statement. “Placing an AI supercomputer on the desks of every data scientist, AI researcher and student empowers them to engage and shape the age of AI.”</p>
