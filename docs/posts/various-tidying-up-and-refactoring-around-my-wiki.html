    <p>It’s been rainy and gross in Munich lately, meaning I’ve had time to do some tidying up around my wiki. Each change isn’t the most interesting on its own but collectively are notable enough to bundle into a small update:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added backlinks to the bottom of all pages. Still working on getting blog posts working.</li>
  <li>Reorganized the <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202312091217.html">fiction</a> and <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202312091218.html">non-fiction</a> bookmarks pages and added some photography.</li>
  <li>Restructured the <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202310090917.html">technology page</a> to focus more on my ideas on digital independence rather than featuring my tech stack.</li>
  <li>Added a photo to the <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202405312250.html">tech stack introduction page</a>.</li>
  <li>Added a <a href="https://www.stevegattuso.me/wiki/202406021332.html">colophon</a> page, providing some insight into the toolchain used for the website.</li>
</ul>

<p>At some point I think it’ll be worthwhile to write something up about how I’ve managed to create a simple mechanism for using TiddlyWiki as a CMS for Jekyll. As my tooling has matured it’s become a pretty powerful force in allowing me to make more of my notes public and keep them up-to-date. I can add a tag to a note in TiddlyWiki, deploy my site, and the note will be published and kept up-to-date from that point on. Pretty neat!</p>
