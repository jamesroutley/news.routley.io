            </p>
                        <p>Technology&#39;s default mode is to constantly call for my attention. Attention is engagement, engagement is profit.</p>
<p>And thus a big chunk of the economy devotes itself to grabbing my attention by increasingly coercive means. It took considerable effort to get technology to just <em>shut the fuck up</em>.</p>
<p>This is what this post is about; making technology quieter, and building a healthier relationship with it.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s wrong?</h2>
<p>I want to use technology on my own terms, for my own ends. I want <a href="https://calmtech.com/">calm technology</a> that respects the boundaries I set for it. This includes respecting my time, my attention, my privacy and above all my consent. I should be the user, it should be the tool, not the other way around.</p>
<blockquote>A person&#39;s primary task should not be computing, but being human.</blockquote>
<p>I no longer want to get sidetracked by deliberately addictive technology when I meant to sit down and do work. I want the computer to go back in its box when I&#39;m done with it - like any other tool - so that I can do other things.<br/></p>
<h2>Silencing technology, bit by bit</h2>
<p>For the last two years, I fought tooth and nail to achieve this. Every time the technology I use negatively affected me, I set up a countermeasure.</p>
<p>I did not throw my smartphone in a lake and retire to the mountains. I just excised the cancerous parts and preserved the good ones.</p>
<h3>Basic tools</h3>
<ul><li>A good ad blocker: <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>. Enable the &#34;annoyances&#34; blocklists. They get rid of most cookie banners.</li><li>A good web browser: Firefox. The Android version lets you install uBlock Origin, and syncs your ad blocker settings between devices. It also has a great distraction-free reader mode.</li><li>A good search results filter: <a href="https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist">uBlacklist</a>. It hides spammy websites from search results.</li><li>A good operating system: Mac OS. Windows has become so user-hostile that I refuse to get near it. Linux breaks the rule above: a person&#39;s primary task should not be computing, but being human.<br/></li></ul>
<p>These tools do most of the heavy lifting. They remove YouTube ads, Pinterest search results, GDPR cookie banners, and a ton of other annoyances.</p>
<h3>Notifications</h3>
<p>I turned off all notifications. Only phone calls, instant messages and bank transactions get through. My phone only vibrates for certain people, so a message from a business parter won&#39;t interrupt breakfast.</p>
<p>Most notifications are not urgent. I can acknowledge them an hour or two later. This is why they are silent.</p>
<blockquote>Technology should require the smallest possible amount of attention. Communicate information without taking the user out of their environment or task. [...] A calm technology will move easily from the periphery of our attention, to the center, and back. The periphery is informing without overburdening.</blockquote>
<p>In other cases, I added notifications, so that I don&#39;t need to monitor things myself. If my website goes down, or my backups stop working, I will know. I can sleep in peace knowing that everything is running smoothly.</p>
<h3>Email</h3>
<p>I turned off email notifications on my phone. On my laptop, I only get them during office hours. The paid version of <a href="https://jasonsavard.com/Checker-Plus-for-Gmail">Checker Plus for Gmail</a> lets me set quiet hours. It&#39;s well worth the money.</p>
<p>I unsubscribe from unwanted emails as soon as I get them, so I get very few of them. I <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en">created filter</a> to delete the few unwanted emails that get through. This includes status emails for things I don&#39;t need to be notified of, like Amazon receiving the order I just placed.</p>
<p>Now, I get 5-10 emails a day, and they&#39;re usually written by a human.</p>

<h3>Calendar</h3>
<p>I made my calendar louder to check my phone less. It vibrates like an alarm until I get to it. This makes it easier not to have my phone on me at all times.</p>
<h3>Apps</h3>
<p>Apps have repeatedly violated my trust, so I rarely use them. I prefer websites, because they have limited access to my device. They are subject to my ad blocker, and stop running when I close the tab. They cannot pry their way to the centre of my attention.<br/></p>
<h3>Social media</h3>
<p>I can&#39;t delete social media because my job depends on it. I find a lot of information on Facebook and Reddit, and share professional updates on multiple platforms.<br/></p>
<p>I just don&#39;t follow anyone. My feeds are empty. I wiped my profiles clean with <a href="https://redact.dev/">Redact</a>, then made them private. I no longer post personal updates there.</p>
<p>Social media websites see this as an affront, and keep trying to growth hack their way back into my life. Every few months, I must block a new &#34;content you may like&#34; or &#34;people you may know&#34; widget.</p>
<p>This had no impact on my social life. Zilch. Facebook was hiding my own mother&#39;s posts from me. My friends were either quiet or silenced by the algorithm. I was already missing out.</p>
<h3>News and feeds</h3>
<p>There were feeds on every website I used, on every new tab I opened, on my phone&#39;s home screen, and in my operating system&#39;s task bar. They were very distracting, so I got rid of them all.</p>
<p>Then I stopped drinking from the firehose of current events. The current muddles the veracity and the importance of things. I prefer a sip from the puddle a little away from the chaos, where the ripples settled and I can see below the surface.<br/></p>
<p>So I switched to long-form articles. After the race against time subsides, the quality of the reporting gets markedly better. It&#39;s less important to be first, and more important to be right.<br/></p>
<p>I also maintain a &#34;things I don&#39;t understand&#34; list. I pluck items from it once in a while, and queue up a few articles about them. They&#39;re nice bite-sized chunks of entertainment.</p>
<p>I use Pocket to queue articles and read them without distractions. It&#39;s okay, but not great. I read on a completely silenced iPad. It&#39;s disconnected from everything - a glorified e-book reader.</p>
<p>This has almost completely replaced scrolling in bed and at the breakfast table. My phone stays muted on my desk until I&#39;ve had coffee.</p>
<p>I read more than ever in my life, and it&#39;s now a deliberate act, not an anxiety-inducing impulse. I have learned a lot more from those sources than from following the news cycle.<br/></p>
<h3>Reddit</h3>
<p>I still use reddit, but a lot less than before.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the mobile app, and the mobile website is bad enough to keep me away.</p>
<p>On desktop, I use old.reddit.com. The old website is simpler, faster and quieter than the redesign. It feels more like a forum, and less like a dopamine casino. The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/old-reddit-redirect/">Old Reddit Redirect</a> extension enforces my choice. I hid a few of the remaining nuisances with ad blocker rules.</p>
<p>I filtered toxic content on the front page by blocking subreddits. A <em>lot</em> of subreddits. There are no more American politics, outrage porn or drama on my front page. I only follow a handful of hobby subreddits.</p>
<p>This is the default reddit experience, and my own:</p>
                            
                <p>A bit later, I hid the &#34;next page&#34; button. I get 25 posts, no more. This cuts mindless browsing by a lot.</p>
<h3>Every other website</h3>
<p>I use uBlock Origin to block a lot more than ads. I block practically
 all suggested content feeds, as well as many notification badges.<br/></p><h3>My own websites</h3>
<p>I removed comments from the websites I run. Instead, I invite people 
to email me. This way, I don&#39;t have to deal with comment moderation, and
 all of my business happens in one place.</p>
<p>Looking at similar websites, I&#39;m probably missing thousands of reader questions, but I do not owe them so much of my time.</p>
<p>I also design my own websites to be calm technology. I tend to forget that the unfiltered web is a lot louder than what I experience. To me, a calm website is just normal.<br/> </p>
<h3>My own behaviour</h3>
<p>I try to leave my phone out of the bedroom. When I go to bed, I put it in silent mode, and leave it on my desk in the living room.</p>
<p>When I wake up, I read articles I have saved in Pocket, instead of getting smacked with raw social media first thing in the morning. The iPad I read on is completely disconnected from the cloud and social media. It&#39;s a distraction-free device.<br/></p>
<p>I used to go straight to the computer - still in my underwear - to 
continue something that started on my phone in bed. Now I have coffee 
and breakfast on the balcony, <em>then</em> catch up with the world.<br/></p>
<p>I also post a lot less online. On one hand, the internet got much 
angrier during the pandemic, and on the other hand, I mellowed out. I don&#39;t get the same rush from engaging with internet drama. It was never worth it.</p><blockquote>A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.</blockquote><h2>Result</h2>
<p>The original draft of this article had a far more desperate tone. It was written by an alcoholic pouring his liquor down the kitchen drain. I was losing sleep over internet drama, and couldn&#39;t fully check out. You read the version rewritten by a sober man, about a year later.</p>
<p>I sometimes forget what the unfiltered internet looks like. A thin article wrapped in ads, topped with five layers of modals, and a video auto-playing in the corner. An inbox that&#39;s 90 percent noise. Two fifteen second ads before each YouTube video, and another one in the middle. Recommended content in every crevice of the user interface. It&#39;s unbearable.<br/></p>
<p>Now it&#39;s all quieter.</p>
<p>Did all this effort unlock superhuman productivity? No. But it prevents technology from constantly hijacking my attention. It gives time well spent a fighting chance against instant gratification.</p>
<p>I spend less time on the computer. I don&#39;t get sidetracked as much. Internet drama does not phase me. I have more time to read, garden, and ride my bicycle.</p>
<p>The computer is a tool again, and now it&#39;s going back in its box.<br/></p>
