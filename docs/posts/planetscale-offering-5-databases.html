    <h1>PlanetScale Offering $5 Databases</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>By <!-- -->Sam Lambert<!-- --> | <time datetime="2025-10-30T09:00:00.000Z">October 30, 2025</time></p><p>PlanetScale is synonymous with quality, performance, and reliability. Up until now, the entry level PlanetScale cluster configuration was 3 node, multi-AZ, and highly available. At $30 a month this is incredible value, however, not everyone wants or needs HA.</p><p>Every day we get requests for an entry level tier that is more accessible to builders on day 1. People want the quality of PlanetScale and our game changing features like <a href="https://planetscale.com/docs/postgres/monitoring/query-insights">Insights</a> without the cost overhead of 3 nodes.</p><p>Over the next couple of months we will be rolling out a single node, non-HA mode for PlanetScale Postgres and introducing a new node type: The <code>PS-5</code> which is priced at $5 a month. Single node is perfect for development, testing, and non-critical workloads. Customers will be able to vertically scale a single node to meet their needs without having to add replicas or sacrifice durability.</p><p>You can sign up <a href="https://planetscale.com/single-node">here</a> to be notified when single node releases.</p><p>Our starter pricing is now:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th>Node Class</th><th>Mode</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PS-5 (arm and intel)</td><td>Single node</td><td>$5</td></tr><tr><td>PS-10 (arm)</td><td>Single node</td><td>$10</td></tr><tr><td>PS-10 (intel)</td><td>Single node</td><td>$13</td></tr><tr><td>PS-10 (arm)</td><td>HA (3 node)</td><td>$30</td></tr><tr><td>PS-10 (intel)</td><td>HA (3 node)</td><td>$39</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>If you&#39;re bullish on your company&#39;s future, you know you&#39;ll need to scale eventually, and the database is usually the first bottleneck. We talk to startups daily who experienced unexpected fast growth and have to scramble through emergency migrations to PlanetScale to handle the load, a stressful process when you&#39;re in the spotlight. With more approachable pricing from day 1, you can now start small and grow to hyper scale without ever changing your database platform or dealing with a complex migration.</p></article></div>
