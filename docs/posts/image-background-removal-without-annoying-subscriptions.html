We took a large sample of user-provided images and compared our output to the best known competing service&#39;s. Here are the results, and be sure to click on each title for an in-depth report:

<p>
What matters more than the quality of our results in general, is the quality of our results on your images in particular. We therefore make the comparison tool available to you for free:

<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>
While AI is rapidly transforming the way we as a society do business, AI itself is changing even faster. What was cutting edge only a few years ago is now rapidly becoming commoditized. 
</p>
<p>
We choose to accept and accelerate this reality. 
</p>
<p>
We therefore see ourselves less as a tech startup, and more as an outsourced MLOps extension to your engineering team. Our goal is to be more &#39;S3&#39; and less &#39;Adobe&#39; for state-of-the-art AI image processing.
