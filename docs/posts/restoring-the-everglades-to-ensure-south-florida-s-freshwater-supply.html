    <h1>Restoring the Everglades to ensure South Florida&#39;s freshwater supply</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The Next Generation</h2><p>Educating the next generation is key to solving today’s environmental challenges. Some students work in the Everglades, taking airboats or helicopter rides to reach their field sites. Others, like <a href="https://news.fiu.edu/2019/everglades-scholar-brings-together-stakeholders-for-common-sense-restoration">Chloe Vorseth</a>, tackle problems without wading through wetlands.</p><p>“I’m not the person studying the plants or counting fish, but I am analyzing data and helping connect people to the environment, whether they are policymakers at the state or federal levels or the general public,” says Vorseth, who earned a master’s in environmental studies at FIU and is an Everglades Foundation ForEverglades Scholar and Ph.D. candidate with a specialty in policy and management and environmental economics.</p><blockquote><p>&#34;We need funding to restore the Everglades. As an environmental economist, I work at the nexus of scientific research and policy to justify action and funding.” <span>— Ph.D. candidate, Chloe Vorseth</span></p></blockquote><p>Vorseth has participated in FIU’s DC Fly-Ins, seminars that bring students to Washington, D.C., to attend advocacy sessions on Capitol Hill and sit down with policy makers. This is one of many ways FIU students receive a unique type of training, according to Gaiser.</p><p>“Our students are much more aware of how to do science in a way that solves problems because their work involves collaborating with scientists from FIU and other academic institutions, as well as scientists at the water management agencies,” she says. “These experiences make a difference as the students move on to eventually work for these agencies or lead grant programs.”</p><h2>Hope for the Future</h2><p>There’s still work to do. So far, though, restoration has resulted in a few glimmers of hope: Water flows in some areas it has not flowed in years.</p><p>Those who know the area best are encouraged.</p><p>Tristan Tigertail, a member of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, grew up in and around the Everglades. A fourth-generation airboat enthusiast, he piloted his first airboat at the age of 7. Four years later, he became the owner of one.</p><p>Today Tigertail works for his uncle as a professional Everglades airboat operator, introducing customers to the beauty of the land he loves. Tigertail has seen the loss of white- tailed deer, birds and cypress domes through the years. He says with efforts now being made to return the flow of water to its original state, the cypress domes are coming back. So are the birds, albeit slowly.</p><p>“Sometimes when the tribe elders gather, they reminisce about how the sky used to blacken overhead when a flock of birds took off. There were so many of them, they would block out the sun,” he says. “I’ve never seen that. But I’ve seen positive changes in the past couple of years, and it gives me hope.”</p><p>Crowl also retains a sense of optimism, saying, “I assure you, our last chapter has not been written.”</p><p>If the last chapter has not yet been written, that means the story is still unfolding. So, against the sprawling, magnificent backdrop of the River of Grass, FIU researchers remain resolved to use the best science and data to safeguard America’s treasure — along with everything and everyone depending on it.</p></div></div>
