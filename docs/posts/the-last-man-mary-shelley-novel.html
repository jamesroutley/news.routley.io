<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley" title="Mary Shelley">Mary Shelley</a> states in the introduction that in 1818 she discovered, in the Sibyl&#39;s cave near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naples" title="Naples">Naples</a>, a collection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy" title="Prophecy">prophetic writings</a> painted on leaves by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumaean_Sibyl" title="Cumaean Sibyl">Cumaean Sibyl</a>. She has edited these writings into the current narrative, the first-person narrative of a man living at the end of the 21st century, commencing in 2073 and concluding in 2100. Despite the chronological setting, the world of <i>The Last Man</i> appears to be relatively similar to the era in which it was written.

<p>Lionel&#39;s father was a friend of the king before he was cast away because of his gambling. Lionel&#39;s father left to take his life, but before he did so he left a letter for the king to take care of his family after his death. After Lionel&#39;s father died the letter was never delivered. Lionel and his sister grow up with no parental influence, and as a result, grow to be uncivilised. Lionel develops a hatred of the royal family, and Perdita grows to enjoy her isolation from society.
When the king leaves the throne, the monarchy comes to an end and a republic is created. When the king dies, the Countess attempts to raise their son, Adrian, to reclaim the throne, but Adrian opposes his mother and refuses to take the throne. Adrian moves to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumberland" title="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> where Lionel, who bears a grudge against Adrian and his family for the neglect of the Verney family, intends to terrorise and confront Adrian. He is mollified by Adrian&#39;s good nature and his explanation that he only recently discovered the letter. Lionel and Adrian become close friends, and Lionel becomes civilised and philosophical under Adrian&#39;s influence. Adrian assists Lionel in pursuing political endeavours in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> which Lionel accepts and leaves for 2 years but chooses to return to England because he hasn&#39;t heard from either Adrian or his sister.
</p><p>Lionel returns to England to face the personal turmoil amongst his acquaintances. Lord Raymond, who came to be renowned for his exploits in a war between Greece and Turkey,<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> has returned to England in search of political position, and soon Perdita and Evadne both fall in love with him. On discovering that his beloved, Evadne, is in love with Raymond, Adrian goes into exile, presumably mad. Raymond intends to marry Idris (with whom Lionel is in love) as a first step towards becoming king, with the help of the Countess. However, he ultimately chooses his love for Perdita over his ambition, and the two marry. Under Lionel&#39;s care, Adrian recovers, although he remains physically weak. On learning of the love between Idris and Lionel, the Countess schemes to drug Idris, bring her to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>, and force her to make a politically motivated marriage. Idris discovers the plot and flees to Lionel, who marries her soon after. The Countess leaves for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>, resentful of her children and of Lionel.
</p><p>Adrian and the others live happily together until Raymond runs for Lord Protector and wins. Perdita soon adjusts to her newfound social position, while Raymond becomes well-beloved as a benevolent administrator. He discovers, however, that Evadne, after the political and financial ruin of her husband (on account of her own political schemes) is living in poverty and obscurity in London, unwilling to plead for assistance. Raymond attempts to support Evadne by employing her artistic skills in secrecy, and later nursing her in illness, but Perdita learns of the relationship and suspects <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity" title="Infidelity">infidelity</a>. Her suspicions arouse Raymond&#39;s proud and passionate nature and the two separate. Raymond resigns his position and leaves to rejoin the war in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece" title="Greece">Greece</a>, accompanied for a time by Adrian. Shortly after the wounded Adrian returns to England, rumours arise that Raymond has been killed. Perdita, loyal in spite of everything, convinces Lionel to bring her and Clara to Greece to find him.

<p>Arriving in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>, Lionel learns that Raymond had been captured by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottomans</a>, and negotiates his return to Greece. Shortly after this, Lionel and Raymond both return to the Greek army and fight their way to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a>. After a decisive battle near the city&#39;s gates, Lionel discovers Evadne, dying of wounds received fighting in the war. Before she dies, Evadne prophesies Raymond&#39;s death, a prophecy which confirms Raymond&#39;s own suspicions. Raymond&#39;s intention to enter the city causes dissension and desertion amongst the army because of reports of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubonic_plague" title="Bubonic plague">plague</a>. Raymond enters the city alone to find that it has been seemingly deserted, and soon dies in an explosion, the result of a trap laid by the Turks. He is taken to a site near Athens for burial. Perdita refuses to leave Greece, but Lionel drugs her and brings her aboard a steamship, believing it to be in the best interests of Clara. Perdita awakens and, distraught at Raymond&#39;s death, drowns herself by throwing herself overboard.
</p><p>In 2092, while Lionel and Adrian attempt to return their lives to normality, the plague continues to spread across Europe and the Americas, and reports of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse" title="Solar eclipse">a black sun</a> cause panic throughout the world, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_surge" title="Storm surge">storm surges</a> flood coastal towns across Europe. At first, England is thought to be safe, but soon the plague reaches even there. Ryland, recently elected <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Protector" title="Lord Protector">Lord Protector</a>, is unprepared for the plague, and flees northward, later dying alone amidst a stockpile of provisions. Adrian takes command and is largely effective at maintaining order and humanity in England, although the plague rages on summer after summer. Ships arrive in Ireland carrying survivors from America, who lawlessly plunder Ireland and Scotland before invading England. Adrian raises a military force against them and ultimately is able to resolve the situation peacefully.

<p>The few remaining survivors decide to abandon England in search of an easier climate. On the eve of their departure to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover" title="Dover">Dover</a>, Lionel receives a letter from Lucy Martin, who was unable to join the exiles because of her mother&#39;s illness. Lionel and Idris travel through a snowstorm to assist Lucy, but Idris, weak from years of stress and maternal fears, dies along the way during the fierce weather. Lionel brings her body to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Castle" title="Windsor Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, interring her in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George%27s_Chapel,_Windsor_Castle" title="St George&#39;s Chapel, Windsor Castle">St George&#39;s Chapel</a>, and is met by the Countess, who reconciles with Lionel at Idris&#39; tomb. Lionel recovers Lucy (whose mother has died), and the party reaches <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover" title="Dover">Dover</a> en route to France.
</p><p>In France, Adrian discovers that the earlier emigrants have divided into factions, amongst them a fanatical religious sect led by a false <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messiah" title="Messiah">messiah</a> who claims that his followers will be saved from disease. Adrian unites most of the factions, but this latter group declares violent opposition to Adrian. Lionel sneaks into Paris, where the cult has settled, to try to rescue Juliet. She refuses to leave because the impostor has her baby, but she helps Lionel to escape after the impostor&#39;s followers imprison him. Later, when Juliet&#39;s baby sickens, Juliet discovers that the impostor has been hiding the effects of the plague from his followers. She is killed warning the other followers, after which the impostor commits suicide, and his followers return to the main body of exiles at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versailles,_Yvelines" title="Versailles, Yvelines">Versailles</a>.
</p><p>The exiles travel towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, hoping to spend the summer in a colder climate less favourable to the plague. By the time they reach Switzerland, however, all but four (Lionel, Adrian, Clara, and Evelyn) have died.

<p><i>The Last Man</i> not only laments the loss of Shelley&#39;s friends, but also questions the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism" title="Romanticism">Romantic</a> political ideals for which they stood.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> In a sense, the plague is metaphorical, since the revolutionary idyll of the élite group is corroded from within by flaws of human nature.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> As literary scholar Kari Lokke writes, &#34;in its refusal to place humanity at the center of the universe, its questioning of our privileged position in relation to nature, then, <i>The Last Man</i> constitutes a profound and prophetic challenge to Western humanism.&#34;<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> Specifically, Mary Shelley, in making references to the failure of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Godwin" title="William Godwin">Godwinian</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Wollstonecraft" title="Mary Wollstonecraft">Wollstonecraftian</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke" title="Edmund Burke">Burkean</a> responses to it, &#34;attacks Enlightenment faith in the inevitability of progress through collective efforts&#34;.<sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup>

<p>Hugh Luke argues, &#34;By ending her story with the picture of the Earth&#39;s solitary inhabitant, she has brought nearly the whole weight of the novel to bear upon the idea that the condition of the individual being is essentially isolated and therefore ultimately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy" title="Tragedy">tragic</a>&#34; (xvii).

<p>Just as her earlier and better-known novel <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein" title="Frankenstein">Frankenstein</a></i> (1818) engaged with scientific questions of electromagnetism, chemistry, and materialism, <i>The Last Man</i> finds Shelley again attempting to understand the scope of scientific inquiry. Unlike the earlier novel&#39;s warnings about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust" title="Faust">Faustian</a> over-reaching, this novel&#39;s devastating apocalypse strongly suggests that medicine had become too timid and ultimately come too late.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> The ineffectual astronomer Merrival, for example, stands in stark contrast to the frighteningly productive Victor Frankenstein. Shelley&#39;s construction of Lionel Verney&#39;s immunity remains a subject of significant critical debate, but the novel certainly demonstrates a deep understanding of the history of medicine, specifically the development of the smallpox vaccine and the various nineteenth-century theories about the nature of contagion.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>

</p><p>Two editions of <i>The Last Man</i> were published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Colburn" title="Henry Colburn">Henry Colburn</a> in London on 23 January 1826,<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> and one edition in Paris in 1826 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Antonio_Galignani" title="Giovanni Antonio Galignani">Galignani</a>. A pirated edition was printed in America in 1833.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> <i>The Last Man</i> received the worst reviews of all of Mary Shelley&#39;s novels:<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2022)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> most reviewers derided the very theme of lastness, which had become a common one in the previous two decades. Individual reviewers labelled the book &#34;sickening&#34;, criticised its &#34;stupid cruelties&#34;, and called the author&#39;s imagination &#34;diseased&#34;.<sup id="cite_ref-paley_intro_16-1"><a href="#cite_note-paley_intro-16">[16]</a></sup> The reaction startled Mary Shelley, who promised her publisher a more popular book next time. Nonetheless, she later spoke of <i>The Last Man</i> as one of her favourite works.
</p><p>The novel was not reprinted until 1965. In the 20th century it received new critical attention, perhaps because the notion of lastness had become more relevant.<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup>
