<p>A handful of useful programming concepts that can each be
implemented in under 20 lines of code.</p>
<p>Estimated reading time: 12 mins</p>

<span>April 3, 2019</span>

<p>I’d like to present a handful of programming concepts that I find incredibly
useful, all of which can be implemented in under 20 lines of code. These
techniques can be used in a wide range of contexts, but here, I’ll show how they
can all build off of each other to produce a full physics engine in just 75
lines of code.</p>
<h2 id="mixing">1. Mixing</h2>
<p>The <code>mix()</code> function takes two values and calculates a value some
percentage of the way between the two.</p>

<p>Some languages include this as a built-in function (like GLSL), but most
don’t, and that’s a shame. Some languages or libraries <em>do</em> include it,
but call it “lerp” (short for “linear interpolation”), which I think is a bad
name. The core concept of mixing two values is simple, so a simple name is best,
and here’s the full implementation:</p>
<p><span>It’s important to implement <code>mix()</code> the way
I’ve presented it, rather than <code>a+amount*(b-a)</code> (the “clever” way
with fewer math operations) because the “clever” version is much more
susceptible to floating point rounding errors when <code>amount</code> is 1.
I’ve encountered this bug before, and it’s a pain in the neck to
debug!</span></p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>def</span> mix(a, b, amount):</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>return</span> (<span>1</span><span>-</span>amount)<span>*</span>a <span>+</span> amount<span>*</span>b</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>mix()</code> function is incredibly handy whenever you’re combining
two values, but it’s also a great case of self-documenting code. Instead of
<code>height = height1 + x*(height2 - height1)</code>, you have
<code>height = mix(height1, height2, x)</code>, which is way more readable! You
can also generalize <code>mix()</code> to mix things like vectors or colors, or
even mixing between more than 2 things. Applying a function like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothstep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">smoothstep</a> to <code>amount</code> can also give non-linear
mixing.</p>
<h2 id="golden-ratio-sampling">2. Golden Ratio Sampling</h2>
<p>Golden ratio sampling is a technique that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">golden ratio</a>
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mo stretchy="true" form="prefix">(</mo><msqrt><mn>5</mn></msqrt><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="true" form="postfix">)</mo></mrow><mi>/</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">(\sqrt{5}+1)/2</annotation></semantics></math>
(often represented with the Greek phi: φ) to generate values evenly distributed
between 0 and 1, where the number of values is not known in advance.</p>

<p><span>The amount the largest gap is divided by is exactly 1/φ,
how cool is that?!</span></p>
<p>Each new value will be in the largest gap between two previously generated
numbers, and each adjacent pair of values will be a fixed distance apart from
each other. The trick is to multiply a counter by the golden ratio and take the
result modulo one:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>GOLDEN_RATIO <span>=</span> (sqrt(<span>5</span>) <span>+</span> <span>1</span>) <span>/</span> <span>2</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>i <span>=</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>def</span> next_sample():</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>nonlocal</span> i</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    i <span>+=</span> <span>1</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>return</span> (i <span>*</span> GOLDEN_RATIO) <span>%</span> <span>1</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><span>Bonus fact: φ-1 = 1/φ. This totally blew my mind when I
first learned it!</span></p>
<p>It’s very broadly applicable, but I often use it for generating colors with
different hues, when I don’t know ahead of time how many colors I’ll need. Each
new color falls between the two most dissimilar colors yet produced. <a href="https://martin.ankerl.com/2009/12/09/how-to-create-random-colors-programmatically/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">This blog post goes into more depth.</a> I also
used golden ratio sampling when I made <a href="https://blog.bruce-hill.com/hill-noise">Hill Noise</a>
because it has a lot of really convenient properties. The paper <a href="https://www.graphics.rwth-aachen.de/media/papers/jgt.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Golden Ratio Sequences For Low-Discrepancy Sampling</a> goes
into more detail and also describes a way to generalize to 2 dimensions and even
a handy technique for reverse-engineering an index from a golden ratio
sample.</p>
<h2 id="exponential-smoothing">3. Exponential Smoothing</h2>
<p>This technique is fantastic for any time you’re trying to get a value to move
something towards a target.</p>

<p>If you just want to move at a constant speed, the code is slightly messy (you
have to avoid overshooting), but not too complex:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>def</span> move_towards(value, target, speed):</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>if</span> <span>abs</span>(value <span>-</span> target) <span>&lt;</span> speed:</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span>return</span> target</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    direction <span>=</span> (target <span>-</span> value) <span>/</span> <span>abs</span>(target <span>-</span> value)</span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>return</span> value <span>+</span> direction <span>*</span> speed</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>value <span>=</span> move_towards(value, target, <span>20</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Implemented this way, the movement can have some undesirable properties.
First of all, when the value reaches the target, it stops jarringly fast.
Secondly, this type of movement has no sense of <em>urgency</em>. It plods along
at the same pace, regardless of how far it has to go. This constant pace means
that if the target is actively moving away at a speed higher than that constant
speed, the target will get further and further away, eventually getting lost.
While this might be physically realistic, it’s very undesirable for something
like a video game’s camera attempting to follow the character. Exponential
smoothing, on the other hand, addresses both of these problems and is even
simpler to implement.</p>
<p><span>If you’re working with a variable-sized timestep and you
<em>really</em> care about precision, the general form is
<code>mix(value, target, 1-(1-speed)**dt)</code>.</span></p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>speed <span>=</span> <span>0.1</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>value <span>=</span> mix(value, target, speed)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Essentially, for every timestep, the value closes <em>a percentage</em> of
the distance to the target instead of a fixed amount of distance. Doing it this
way is very aesthetically pleasing, and easy to implement, so it’s a great trick
to keep up your sleeve.</p>
<h2 id="verlet-integration">4. Verlet Integration</h2>
<p>Verlet integration is a math technique that can be used for simulating
physics and I think it’s severely underrated.</p>

<p>Typically, one of the first things you’ll learn in a game programming
tutorial is this technique for simulating motion:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span># Euler integration</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>new_vel <span>=</span> vel <span>+</span> dt<span>*</span>accel</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>new_pos <span>=</span> pos <span>+</span> dt<span>*</span>new_vel</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This is called Euler integration, and it’s only one of many different
approximations of how position changes over time. The other approximations have
different complexity and accuracy tradeoffs. For example, the Runge-Kutta 4th
degree approximation is much more accurate, but is complex to code and slower to
compute. However, there’s a third type of integration which is rarely discussed,
but which has some amazing properties. It’s called Verlet Integration, and
instead of storing position and velocity, you store the current position and the
previous position. Assuming you’re using a constant-sized timestep (<a href="http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">which you should be doing anyways</a>), the calculation
becomes:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span># Verlet integration</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>vel <span>=</span> (pos <span>-</span> prev_pos)<span>/</span>dt</span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>new_vel <span>=</span> vel <span>+</span> dt<span>*</span>accel</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>new_pos <span>=</span> pos <span>+</span> dt<span>*</span>new_vel</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But using substitution, the code above simplifies to:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span># Verlet integration (simplified)</span></span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>new_pos <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>*</span>pos <span>-</span> prev_pos <span>+</span> dt<span>*</span>dt<span>*</span>accel</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What’s really useful about this approach is that velocity is
<em>implicitly</em> derived from the position and previous position, so if you
have to impose constraints on the position, then the correct velocities are
<em>automatically calculated!</em> For instance, if you need to keep an object’s
position between <code>0,0</code> and <code>WIDTH,HEIGHT</code>, the Euler
approach would be:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>new_pos <span>=</span> pos <span>+</span> dt<span>*</span>vel</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>if</span> new_pos.x <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    new_pos.x <span>=</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>if</span> vel.x <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        vel.x <span>=</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb8-6"><a href="#cb8-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>if</span> new_pos.x <span>&gt;</span> WIDTH:</span>
<span id="cb8-7"><a href="#cb8-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    new_pos.x <span>=</span> WIDTH</span>
<span id="cb8-8"><a href="#cb8-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>if</span> vel.x <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb8-9"><a href="#cb8-9" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        vel.x <span>=</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb8-10"><a href="#cb8-10" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>if</span> new_pos.y <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb8-11"><a href="#cb8-11" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    new_pos.y <span>=</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb8-12"><a href="#cb8-12" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>if</span> vel.y <span>&lt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb8-13"><a href="#cb8-13" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        vel.y <span>=</span> <span>0</span></span>
<span id="cb8-14"><a href="#cb8-14" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>if</span> new_pos.y <span>&gt;</span> HEIGHT:</span>
<span id="cb8-15"><a href="#cb8-15" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    new_pos.y <span>=</span> HEIGHT</span>
<span id="cb8-16"><a href="#cb8-16" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>    <span>if</span> vel.y <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span>:</span>
<span id="cb8-17"><a href="#cb8-17" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        vel.y <span>=</span> <span>0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>With Verlet integration, that whole mess just becomes:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>new_pos <span>=</span> <span>2</span><span>*</span>pos <span>-</span> prev_pos</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>new_pos <span>=</span> vec(clamp(new_pos.x, <span>0</span>, WIDTH),</span>
<span id="cb9-3"><a href="#cb9-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>              clamp(new_pos.y, <span>0</span>, HEIGHT))</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This works for all sorts of constraints, including snapping an object to your
mouse, keeping an object on camera, keeping two objects attached to each other,
preventing two objects from overlapping each other, and so on. Whatever
positional constraints you apply, the velocities will just work themselves out
to the correct values.</p>
<p>If you ever need to change an object’s speed, simply modify the previous
state value:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>prev_pos <span>=</span> pos <span>-</span> desired_vel<span>*</span>dt</span></code></pre></div>
<p>A full explanation of Verlet integration is beyond the scope of this post,
but
<a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131313/advanced_character_physics.php">Thomas
Jakobsen did an excellent writeup for Gamasutra</a> and
<a href="http://codeflow.org/entries/2010/nov/29/verlet-collision-with-impulse-preservation/">Florian
Boesch also has a great post addressing some issues that can arise.</a></p>
<h2 id="spatial-hashing">5. Spatial Hashing</h2>
<p>Collision checking is one of the most performance-intensive parts of most
games. You need to know when objects collide with each other, but if you have a
large number of objects, it takes a lot of time to check for every possible
collision. There’s some really efficient techniques for speeding up collision
checking, like Quadtrees, Binary Space Partitions, and Sweep-and-Prune. However,
many of these are a hassle to implement and are very susceptible to making
off-by-one mistakes as you do. Instead, you can get great performance out of a
very simple implementation using spatial hashing.</p>

<p>To do collision checking with spatial hashing, you divide the world into
large grid cells (buckets). For each object, you find all the buckets that it
approximately touches (it’s okay to be overly inclusive, as long as you don’t
miss any) and add the object to each bucket’s list of members. As you do, mark
the object as potentially colliding with the bucket’s existing members. After
processing each object, you’ll have a list of all potential collisions, which
you can then process to filter out any false positives (things that fall into
the same bucket but don’t actually overlap). For most use cases, this process is
very close to linear in speed, because most hash buckets can only fit a couple
of objects, and most objects only touch a couple of buckets.</p>
<p>In the demo above, you can see the hash buckets, as well as all the collision
checks (lines between circles), most of which are false positives (dashed
lines). As the hash buckets get smaller, the number of false positives
diminishes, but the number of populated buckets increases. You can drag around
the circles to see how they get hashed into different buckets. I chose to use
bounding boxes around the circles to find which buckets they might touch because
that was easy to implement and fast, but you could be more precise if you wanted
to.</p>
<p><span>Python allows tuples as keys in a dictionary, but in
languages that have hash tables but not tuples (e.g. Javascript, Lua), you can
use <code>x+&#34;,&#34;+y</code> (a string key) or <code>x+(GOLDEN_RATIO*y%1)</code> (a
floating point key using the <a href="#Golden-Ratio-Sampling">golden ratio
sampling technique</a>). Or, you could just use a big array and a simple hash
function like <code>buckets[(x*K+y)%nbuckets]</code>.</span></p>

<p>Picking the size of the hash buckets is somewhat arbitrary. The smaller your
buckets, the more fine-grained the bucketing is, and the less likely you are to
have false positives. However, the smaller the buckets, the more of them there
are, so it takes more time to put everything into its buckets and look through
the bucket contents. As a rule of thumb, I tend to make my buckets slightly
bigger than the size of a median-sized object. That way, most objects will land
in between 1 and 4 buckets. However, if precise collision checking is very slow,
it might make sense to use smaller buckets to trade off more bucketing time for
fewer false positive full collision checks. If it really matters, don’t rely on
your intuition, profile the code!</p>
<h2 id="iterative-constraint-solving">6. Iterative Constraint Solving</h2>
<p>Alongside Verlet integration, it’s very useful to be able to solve systems
with multiple constraints. A common example would be a constraint that two
objects can’t overlap each other, or that all objects must be within the bounds
of the screen. In order to solve a constraint, you need to calculate new
positions for the objects that satisfy the conditions of the constraint. For a
single constraint, this is often very easy (e.g. to solve the “stay on screen”
constraint, you simply clamp the position’s values to a specified range).</p>
<p>Things get more complicated when you have to solve multiple constraints.
Sometimes solving one constraint causes another constraint to be violated, like
if moving an object back on screen causes it to overlap with another object. It
may not even be possible to find a solution that satisfies all constraints. So,
instead of trying to combine all your constraints together and find a perfect
solution, it’s much easier to just try to move incrementally closer to an
approximate solution. Here, you can see the “no overlap” and “stay on screen”
constraints being solved one at a time:</p>

<p>The <code>stiffness</code> parameter controls how aggressively each iteration
attempts to solve each constraint. If the stiffness is at its maximum, each
constraint is solved fully on each step, but this can cause a sort of
ping-ponging effect when solving one constraint makes another constraint worse,
like if one circle is sandwiched between two others. Relaxing the stiffness
makes each step move only part of the way towards a solution, which has the
effect of making the circles a feel little elastic. With a lower stiffness, the
simulation tends to be less erratic, but you might end up with some of the
constraints being not fully satisfied (which is bad for rigid objects like
rocks, but more realistic for soft objects like people).</p>
<p>This code shows the constraint solving for staying on screen and circular
objects not overlapping each other:</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span>def</span> solve_constraints(stiffness<span>=</span><span>0.5</span>):</span>

<p>The sorts of constraints you can implement are bounded only by your
imagination and your ability to write code that takes an incorrect state and
outputs a correct state. You can have no-overlap constraints for arbitrary
polygons, joint constraints for limbs, hinges, or chains, mouse dragging
constraints, path-following constraints, or constraints that make things line up
in a tidy grid.</p>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting It All Together</h2>
<p>Using everything from this tutorial, you can bang together a full physics
engine in just 75 lines of code. <a href="https://blog.bruce-hill.com/media/6-snippets/physics.py">Here’s
my Python implementation</a> (using <a href="https://blog.bruce-hill.com/media/6-snippets/vec2.py">this
simple vector library</a>), and here’s a live Javascript demo that’s basically
the same, with a few extra bells and whistles bringing it to ~250 lines:</p>

<p>This is just one way to use these techniques, and I encourage you to look for
other creative ways to combine these snippets with other useful ideas.
Innovation is almost always the result of combining existing ideas in creative
new ways: Hashing + collision detection = spatial hashing, <code>mix()</code> +
color = gradients, Verlet integration + iterative constraint solvers = physics
engine, golden ratio + color hue = color generator. The snippets presented here
are the sort of self-contained ideas that I’ve found to be very good at
combining with other ideas.</p>
