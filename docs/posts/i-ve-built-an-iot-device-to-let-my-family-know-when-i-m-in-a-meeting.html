<p>Do you work from home, and do people in your household always show up at the worst possible moments?</p>

<p>Let me introduce the “I’m in Meeting” IoT device: it lights up at your office door whenever you turn on your webcam.</p>

<p>It consists of an ESP32 with <code>mDNS</code> connected to Wi-Fi, using the Arduino framework for simplicity. The ESP32 exposes an HTTP server that handles a PATCH request on the /camera endpoint. This endpoint receives a JSON payload with a status of “on” or “off”, and turns the LED panel red or blue accordingly.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, mDNS (or Bonjour on Apple platforms) is a way to assign an IP address to a .local hostname for the device, so I don’t need to figure out its IP manually—just use the local domain.</p>

<p>Super convenient, right?</p>

<p>On the other side, I have a Python daemon that periodically queries Apple’s API to check if any cameras are in use, and then sends a PATCH request with “on” or “off” to http://esp32.local/camera.</p>

<p>Very simple, but quite useful.</p>
