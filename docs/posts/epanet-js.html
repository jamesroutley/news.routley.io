    <h1>epanet-js</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://epanetjs.com/">epanet-js</a> is a new web application that combines modern web maps with the industry-standard <a href="https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet">EPANET</a> hydraulic simulation algorithm. It’s for people planning and updating water utility systems: connecting pipes and pressures and figuring out what will happen. It’s a problem area that I’m totally fascinated by and know very little about. It’s made by the folks from <a href="https://iterating.ca/">Iterating</a> - Luke Butler and Sam Payá, who are experts in the field.</p><p>If you’ve been following along with my blog and projects, you might notice something familiar about this screenshot of epanet-js:</p><p><img alt="epanet-js" src="https://macwright.com/images/2025-07-03-epanet-matrado-placemark-epanet-js.png"/></p><p>Yep! A lifetime ago, I built a company and product called <a href="https://www.placemark.io/">Placemark</a>, which was a tool for creating and editing map data. When the business part didn’t work out, I published a <a href="https://play.placemark.io/">free-to-use version of Placemark</a> and <a href="https://macwright.com/2024/01/19/placemark-oss">made the code open source</a>. I chose a very permissive license for the code: <a href="https://drewdevault.com/2022/02/07/Free-software-licenses-MIT.html">the MIT license</a>. I wanted to let <em>anything</em> happen, including - <em>especially</em> - people creating paid products with the code.</p><p>It’s hard to explain to people outside of the world of open source that folks building a business with the help of my code is <em>the dream</em>.</p><p>Partly it’s that ‘being helpful’ is one of the goals in life that never gets old. The other part is that <a href="https://macwright.com/2012/06/13/programming">most software becomes obsolete and abandoned quickly</a>. Creating software with any legacy is rare and something to celebrate.</p><p>Plus, Placemark was a general purpose tool in search of a successful niche: I never figured out what that niche was. I had a lot of learning to do about product-market-fit. But hydraulic simulation is a real market, and these folks are real experts.</p><p>There are other markets like this, I’m sure, and using Placemark code as a base could be a good way to jumpstart those companies - it’s not perfect, as I’ve documented extensively, but it could be good as a first step.</p><p>And the folks at Iterating have even <a href="https://github.com/placemark/placemark/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+is%3Apr+author%3Albutler">contributed changes upstream to the open source Placemark</a> codebase, but that isn’t required by the MIT license at all: that’s just because they’re cool folks.</p><p>They’ve also <a href="https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js">open sourced the core epanet-js library</a>, and released the web application <a href="https://github.com/epanet-js/epanet-js/blob/main/LICENSE">under the Functional Source License</a>, which <a href="https://fsl.software/">makes new code contributions open source after two years</a>.</p><video controls=""><source src="https://images.macwright.com/2025-07-03-epanet-optimized.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>&lt;/source&gt;</video><p>And epanet-js is a tool that you can run in a browser - full simulations with a WASM-based engine. It’s competing with expensive old-school software that costs $16,000 a year, runs exclusively on Windows, is <a href="https://www.bentley.com/software/openflows-water/">priced by “pipes”</a>, and uses the same engine, EPANET. This is so much better in comparison. A radical improvement.</p><p>Congrats to Luke and Sam for creating <a href="https://epanetjs.com/">epanet-js</a>. It’s super cool. If you speak hydraulic simulation or know someone who does, try it out!</p></div></div>
