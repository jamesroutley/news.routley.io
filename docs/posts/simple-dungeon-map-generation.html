        <p>As of Smol Dungeon v1.1 (the launch version) there are four flavors of map generation. This is a rich topic and there are loads of awesome map gen algorithms to <a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2014/12/21/rooms-and-mazes/">read about online</a>. This is just a smol sample of what&#39;s possible.</p>
        <h2>Rooms</h2>
        <p>If you&#39;re interested in map generation this is the algorithm to start with. You dig out a series of rectangular rooms and then connect them up with a series of hallways. For a classic look, don&#39;t allow the rooms to overlap. In Smol Dungeon rooms are allowed to overlap.</p>

        <h2>Circles</h2>
        <p>The same idea as the rooms algorithm but with circles instead of rectangles. The circular shape combined with overlap creates more organic &#34;cave-like&#34; maps.</p>

        <h2>Hallways</h2>
        <p>Monsters block your path in Smol Dungeon, so having narrow corridors can create quite tense situations for the player to resolve (or die from). We select a series of points and then join them up with some tunneling.</p>

        <h2>Templates</h2>
        <p>Although procedurally generated levels are technically &#34;limitless&#34; they can end up having a very repetitive feel (hence three different proc gen map types). To further alleviate this we also have many pre-defined hand drawn maps. I drew most of these on paper and then translated to my very sophisticated tile map data structure.</p>
        <pre>            let ZIG_ZAG = &#34;&#34;&#34;

        <p>Given Smol Dungeon&#39;s 10x10 map constraint, map generation for the game did not need to be more complex than these few procedures. A larger game would likely benefit from a more sophisticated approach. If you&#39;re working on a game I&#39;d encourage you to try mixing and matching different procedures, e.g. a rectangular approach for dungeon levels and the circular approach for cavern levels.</p>
