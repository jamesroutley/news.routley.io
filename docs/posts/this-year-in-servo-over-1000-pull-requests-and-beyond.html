    <h1>This year in Servo: over 1000 pull requests and beyond</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>2023-12-18</span> Reflections on Servo’s progress in 2023: contributor stats, new features, layout improvements, WPT pass rates, and plans for next year.</p><div>
  <p>Servo is well and truly back.</p>

<figcaption>Contributors to <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">servo/servo</a> in 2023.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span></span>
This year, to date, we’ve had <strong>53 unique contributors</strong> (+140% over 22 last year), landing <strong>1037 pull requests</strong> (+382% over 215) and 2485 commits (+375% over 523), and that’s just in <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo">our main repo</a>!</p>
<p>Individual contributors are especially important for the health of the project, and of the pull requests made by humans (rather than our <a href="https://github.com/servo-wpt-sync">friendly</a> <a href="https://github.com/dependabot">bots</a>), 30% were by people outside Igalia, and 18% were by non-reviewers.</p>
<p>Servo has been featured in <a href="https://servo.org/about/">six conference talks</a> this year, including at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdHvHoAO5oo">RustNL</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfk8s5OD99A">Web Engines Hackfest</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4qedc-0pjs&amp;t=2356s">LF Europe Member Summit</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/9lkIX5ryZZ4">Open Source Summit Europe</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/RugzThWcjn4">GOSIM Workshop</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx70W83Bxtc">GOSIM Conference</a>.</p>
<p>Servo now has a usable “minibrowser” UI, now supports offscreen rendering, its experimental WebGPU support (<code>--pref dom.webgpu.enabled</code>) has been updated, and Servo is now listed on <a href="https://wpt.fyi">wpt.fyi</a> again (click <span>Edit</span> to add Servo).</p>
<p><a href="https://servo.org/blog/2023/04/13/layout-2013-vs-2020/">Our new layout engine</a> is now proving its strengths, with support for iframes, floats, stacking context improvements, inline layout improvements, margin collapsing, ‘position: sticky’, ‘min-width’ and ‘min-height’, ‘max-width’ and ‘max-height’, ‘align-content’, ‘justify-content’, ‘white-space’, ‘text-indent’, ‘text-align: justify’, <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2023/05/31/adding-support-for-outline-properties/">‘outline’ and ‘outline-offset’</a>, and ‘filter: drop-shadow()’.</p>

<p><span></span>
<a href="https://github.com/dbaron/inlines-and-floats">Floats are notoriously tricky</a>, to the point we found them <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Servo-Layout-Engines-Report">impossible to implement correctly</a> in our legacy layout engine, but thanks to the move from eager to opportunistic parallelism, they are now supported fairly well.
Whereas legacy layout was only ever able to reach 53.9% in the floats tests and 68.2% in floats-clear, we’re now at <strong>82.2% in floats</strong> (+28.3pp over legacy) and <strong>73.3% in floats-clear</strong> (+5.1pp over legacy).</p>
<p><a href="http://acid1.acidtests.org">Acid1</a> now passes in the new layout engine, and we’ve also surpassed legacy layout in the <strong>CSS2 abspos (by 50.0pp)</strong>, CSS2 positioning (by 6.5pp), and CSS Position (by 4.4pp) test suites, while making big strides in others, like the <strong>CSSOM tests (+13.1pp)</strong> and key parts of the <strong>CSS2 test suite (+15.8pp)</strong>.</p>
<p><span></span>
<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Roadmap/106e95887c3d9768f791a4e0501ba5c89abe9636">Next year</a>, our funding will go towards maintaining Servo, releasing nightlies on Android, finishing our integration with Tauri (thanks to NLNet), and implementing tables and better support for floats and non-Latin text (thanks to NLNet).</p>
<p>Servo will also be at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/">FOSDEM 2024</a>, with Rakhi Sharma speaking about <a href="https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2321-embedding-servo-in-rust-projects/">embedding Servo in Rust projects</a> on <strong>3 February</strong> at <strong>16:45 local time</strong> (15:45 UTC).
See you there!</p>
<p>There’s a lot more we would like to do, so if you or a company you know are interested in sponsoring the development of an embeddable, independent, memory-safe, modular, parallel web rendering engine, we want to hear from you!
Head over to <a href="https://servo.org/sponsorship/">our sponsorship page</a>, or email <a href="https://servo.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a6ccc9cfc8e6d5c3d4d0c988c9d4c1"><span data-cfemail="b9d3d6d0d7f9cadccbcfd697d6cbde">[email protected]</span></a> for enquiries.</p>
<p>In a decade that many people feared would become the nadir of browser engine diversity, we hope we can help change that with Servo.</p>
