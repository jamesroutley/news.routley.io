But when music is licensed to movies, television or advertisements, artists generally get a bigger payday, on the understanding that a third party is bearing the relevant costs. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After the advent of iTunes and Spotify, labels often argued that downloads and streams should  be counted as sales.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>This prompted a flurry of lawsuits, especially in the US. Most famously, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/business/media/28eminem.html">the producers who discovered Eminem won a case against Universal Records</a> that forced the label to pay the higher &#34;licensing&#34; rate when his songs were downloaded.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Four Tet&#39;s case in the UK essentially made the same argument.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Domino had argued that digital downloads, including streams, were considered a new technology format and Hebden was only entitled to the 13.5% royalty rate (although they have paid him as much as 18% on a discretionary basis).</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The case quickly became complicated, with Hebden adding a claim for breach of contract after Domino withdrew his music from streaming services; and Domino saying they may to take the case to the High Court, which Hebden could not afford.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, in a statement posted on social media today, Hebden said he had been offered the 50% rate he had sought in a settlement, the details of which were made public.</p></div><div data-component="social-embed-block"><div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have a bodacious update on my case with <a href="https://twitter.com/Dominorecordco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Dominorecordco</a>. They have recognised my original claim, that I should be paid a 50% royalty on streaming and downloads, and that they should be treated as a license rather than the same as a CD or vinyl sale.</p>— Four Tet (@FourTet) <a href="https://twitter.com/FourTet/status/1538871641148731393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2022</a></blockquote>
