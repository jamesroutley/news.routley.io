    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fedi</a>, one thing I&#39;ve really enjoyed following last year and this is<!-- --> <a href="https://writing.natwelch.com/tag/decemberadventure">#decemberadventure</a>. It was <a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">first defined by Eli</a> in 2022, but I just found out about it last December. I didn&#39;t have any particular plan to participate this year, but during thanksgiving, I noticed the Agents tab on the GitHub Mobile App.</p>
<p><a href="https://icco.imgix.net/photos/2025/0NVS5ARTRR2HC.png"><img src="https://icco.imgix.net/photos/2025/0NVS5ARTRR2HC.png?w=300" alt="github"/></a></p>
<p>I know there is a strong anti-LLM bend to a lot of the Fediverse and the art-communities that I belong to. I have very complicated feelings about the term AI and AI&#39;s affect on human creativity and creation. I deeply understand the arguments around both training and usage, but I still use it heavily at work and occasionally in my personal life. Given I use it so heavily at work, I have found myself exploring LLMs more and more as a tool for creation. I use it regularly for coding and image generation. I have not used it for writing or music creation, as I find both of those the lack of humanity is visible in the creation<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Anyways, I used Github Agents to create a dumb little discord bot almost entirely using the Agent in the Github Mobile App on Android. This was neat because I basically gave the agent tasks while I helped cook Thanksgiving Dinner. Since then I have made some manual changes, and added some features, but it has now been stable for a few weeks and I wanted to share what I built.</p>

<p>Essentially, I keep an archive of images and artists I like online in a folder on Dropbox. It&#39;s gotten very large over the years. It&#39;s organized by creator and platform they posted on.</p>

<p>It has gotten so large, I don&#39;t really know what is there anymore. So I wanted to post 10 or so images to my private Discord server once an hour. I also added a reaction to each image. If I click on the number, it copies the image to a Favorites folder. I often edit these images and make them wallpapers for my laptop.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed this process. I&#39;ve had a lot of problems trying to interact with the Dropbox API in the past, but copilot got the querying correct the first try. If you want to see the generated code, it&#39;s at <a href="https://github.com/icco/artgrabber">icco/artgrabber</a>.</p>
