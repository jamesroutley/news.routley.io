    <h1>Tell HN: 2 years building a kids audio app as a solo dev – lessons learned</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hi,</p><p>I started Muky in April 2024. Classic side project that got out of hand. We have two kids - the younger one is happy with the Toniebox, but our older one outgrew it. She started asking for specific songs, audiobooks that aren&#39;t available as figurines, and &#34;the music from that movie.&#34;</p><p>We had an old iPad Mini lying around and already pay for Apple Music. Felt dumb to keep buying €17/$20 figurines for 30-45 minutes of content when we have 100 million songs.</p><p>Now at version 4.0 after ~20 updates. Some lessons:</p><p>On the hardware vs app tradeoff:
Toniebox and Yoto are brilliant for little ones – tactile, simple, no screen needed. But they hit a wall once kids want more. And handing a 5-year-old Apple Music means infinite scrolling and &#34;Dad, what&#39;s this song about?&#34; Muky sits in between – full library access, but parents control what&#39;s visible.</p><p>On sharing:
Remember lending CDs or cassettes to friends? Or kids swapping Tonie figurines at a playdate? I wanted that for a digital app. So I built QR code sharing. Scan, import, done. And unlike a physical thing – both keep a copy.</p><p>On onboarding:
First versions: empty app, figure it out yourself. Retention was awful. Now: 4-step onboarding that actually guides you. Should&#39;ve done this from the start.</p><p>On content discovery:
100 million songs sounds great until you have to find something. Parents don&#39;t want to search – they want suggestions. Spent a lot of time building a Browse tab with curated albums and audiobooks for kids. Finally feels like the app helps you instead of just waiting for input.</p><p>On going native:
Went with Swift/SwiftUI instead of Flutter or React Native. No regrets - SwiftUI is a joy to work with and performance is great. Android users ask for a port regularly. No capacity for that now, but Swift for Android is progressing (<a href="https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-sdk-for-android-getting-started.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.swift.org/documentation/articles/swift-sdk-for-a...</a>). Maybe one day. CarPlay is another one parents keep asking for – going native should make that easier to add, if Apple grants me the entitlement.</p><p>On subscriptions vs one-time:
Started with one-time purchase. Revenue spikes at launch, then nothing. Switched to subscription – existing one-time buyers kept full access. Harder to sell, but sustainable.</p><p>Ask me anything about indie iOS dev or building for kids.
