<div>
          <p dir="auto">Here&#39;s how you (and all of us) have to handle it, according to the GDPR:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Contact the DPO (data protection officer) of Microsoft and point them to this discussion. The contact details are here: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-data-protection-officer" rel="nofollow">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/gdpr-data-protection-officer</a>.</li>
</ol>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Data subjects may contact the data protection officer by filling
out the webform at https://aka.ms/privacyresponse.

The DPO can also be reached by post at:

<p dir="auto">In your message to the DPO, refer to <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-7-gdpr/" rel="nofollow">art. 7(1) of the GDPR</a>, which has this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Point out that you did not give consent for the data to be collected, nor were you asked about it. Per GDPR, they&#39;re supposed to be <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/" rel="nofollow">transparent</a> about the way personal data are handled (see Art. 5). They ought to tell you: what personal data are collected, for what purpose, for how long the data are stored, with whom the data are shared (this could be buried somewhere deep in the UI). Give them ~2 weeks to respond. If you receive no feedback, then:</p>
<ol start="2" dir="auto">
<li>Contact your local DPA (data protection authority) and lodge a complaint (see <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-77-gdpr/" rel="nofollow">art. 77 of the GDPR</a>)</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes this Regulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">But step 0 would be to think about the situation and consider what data are collected. Are those personal data? Does Microsoft, perhaps, have a &#34;legitimate interest&#34; in collecting this information?</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">It is concluded, that you do not respect the users privacy, do not comply with the GDPR and ignore any users objections against your negligent way of personal data processing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><a data-hovercard-type="user" data-hovercard-url="/users/nandlab/hovercard" data-octo-click="hovercard-link-click" data-octo-dimensions="link_type:self" href="https://github.com/nandlab">@nandlab</a>  no, it is not concluded yet. It might be the case, but the right course of action is to get there  through the means the GDPR gives us. The regulation says you should contact the DPO, and eventually lodge a complaint with the DPA; it doesn&#39;t say that programmers on Github have to monitor issues and are responsible for handling privacy-related stuff. To play this game well, you have to play by the rules; let the DPO know about it - and if they&#39;re still silent, they might be more responsive if they get a call from a DPA ;-)</p>
