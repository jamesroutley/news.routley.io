    <h1>&#39;Naive&#39; science fan faces jail for plutonium import</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A &#34;science nerd&#34; who wanted to collect all the elements of the periodic table could face jail time after ordering radioactive material over the internet.</p><p>But Emmanuel Lidden, 24, will have to wait to learn his sentence after breaching nuclear non-proliferation laws by shipping samples of plutonium to his parents&#39; suburban Sydney unit.</p><p>The incident sparked a major hazmat incident, with Australian Border Force (ABF) officials, firefighters, police and paramedics all attending the scene in August 2023.</p><figure><div><div><p><span><img alt="Radioactivity sign (file)" data-src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PF1glwB7aDUqMpnvmqeaqw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aap.com.au/5d6a7cf865fbac3bb57aeb7f734a63eb"/></span></p></div></div><p><figcaption>The &#34;innocent collector&#34; wanted all the elements of the periodic table, his lawyer said. (Alan Porritt/AAP PHOTOS)</figcaption></p></figure><p>Far from any intent to build something nefarious like a nuclear weapon with the material, Lidden&#39;s lawyer John Sutton described his client as an &#34;innocent collector&#34; and &#34;science nerd&#34; who had been left flipping burgers after being sacked from his job following the incident.</p><p>&#34;He did not import or possess these items with any sinister intent ... these were offences committed out of pure naivety,&#34; Mr Sutton told Sydney&#39;s Downing Centre District Court on Friday.</p><p>&#34;It was a manifestation of self-soothing retreating into collection, it could have been anything but in this case he latched onto the collection of the periodic table.&#34;</p><p>Lidden had also been a keen collector of stamps, bank notes and coins.</p><p>But prosecutors said describing the young man as a simple collector and science nerd were a mischaracterisation.</p><p>This sort of incident where &#34;collectors&#34; sought illegal material created a market that might not have otherwise existed, the court was told.</p><p>Mr Sutton argued border force officials had engaged in duplicitous and unfair conduct by returning some of the material to Lidden after initially seizing it.</p><p>&#34;(Lidden) knew this was a radioactive substance but he was allowed to possess it, and perhaps he thought it was because it was a minimal quantity,&#34; Mr Sutton said.</p><p>&#34;There was no Sherlock Holmes detection here by the ABF, the packages had (Lidden&#39;s) address and his name ... investigators were aware he had obtained this material and it was in a very small quantity.&#34;</p><figure><div><div><p><span><img alt="Hazmat tape at the Arncliffe property (file)" data-src="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/1sX2n4fCCmp1R53p._QeyA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aap.com.au/4ea729fe65cd0436c3a18a2345e6d35b"/></span></p></div></div><p><figcaption>The seizure in a hazmat incident was a massive overreaction, the defence lawyer said.
