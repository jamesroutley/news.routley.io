    <h1>An introduction to correspondence texting</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>I hit a milestone today. For the first time since I got a phone, I had replied to all of my outstanding texts.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> (It lasted two minutes).</p>
<p>As many of my friends will tell you, this is quite the feat for me. I&#39;m not a good texter. I take forever to respond, or don&#39;t respond at all. But I&#39;m getting better, and the tips I&#39;ve listed here have helped me, particularly for long-term conversations. I hope they help you too.</p>

<p>If I was living thirty years ago, I wouldn&#39;t keep up with most of my friends over text, mostly because texting had barely been invented.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> Instead, I&#39;d probably be using some combination of handwritten letters, faxed letters, email, computer instant messages, and phone calls.</p>
<p>I am at risk of romanticizing the past, but I think texting has disadvantages over these media for <em>long-term communication.</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> While texting is excellent for quick timescales, it has several disadvantages for maintaining friendships over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Texting pressures you to respond shortly and quickly, rather than infrequently at length.</li>
<li>Texting conversations often die, especially if replies are infrequent.</li>
<li>It&#39;s hard to look back over old conversations.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I had the choice, I&#39;d prefer to keep up with friends over email/phone, but texting&#39;s ease has made it the default choice. I&#39;ve adapted, and found ways to make texting more appropriate for communication over long timescales.</p>
<p>I call this <em>correspondence texting</em>: longer, infrequent messages closer to letters, taking place over months or years. This is in contrast to &#34;instant texting,&#34; composed of short, frequent texts.</p>
<p>Over the rest of this post, I&#39;ll cover ways to make correspondence texting easier by a) making it easier for me to respond b) making it easier for the other person to respond c) making it easier to peruse old texts later and d) choosing when to not correspondence text.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>(If you are going to read one tip, read Tip 4.)</p>

<p>My central goal in this section is to respond <em>with pauses but consistently.</em></p>
<p>The primary challenge is consistent responses: if I&#39;m maintaining more than a couple conversations, I cannot respond every day to each of them. However, the way texting is designed, old messages are quickly buried. So how do I remember to respond?</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Triage your texts</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Give yourself permission to respond less frequently for correspondence</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Consider responding to a lot of texts at once</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Respond oldest to newest</strong> (only applies to correspondence):</p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Visually mark un-responded texts</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: If you want to time a message, consider schedule sending the text</strong>:</p>

<p>As the song goes, &#34;it may be two to tango/but boy, it&#39;s one to let go...&#34;<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10">10</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: End every<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11">11</a></sup> response with at least one question</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: If someone hasn&#39;t responded in a while, feel free to reach out again!</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Tip 9: Tailor response length to your recipient</strong>:</p>

<p>One lovely thing about letters and emails is that each stands on their own. You can open a drawer, or your inbox, and immediately be transported to the past. With texting, this is a lot harder. I&#39;m less certain about these tips, but they might be useful?<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16">16</a></sup></p>
<p><strong>Tip 10: Consider sending more pictures?</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Tip 11: Download your texts using a tool like iMazing?</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Tip 12: Use another platform?</strong>:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have concrete tips here, but it&#39;s helpful to remember that other media exist! I exchange emails with a couple of friends, and primarily call others. </p>
<p><em>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to use one of those other forms of media by leaving a comment or emailing me at kai at liquidbrain [dot] net!</em><sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18">18</a></sup></p>

<p>Technically, I had a WhatsApp message I had yet to respond to, but I had responded to all of my <em>text</em> messages. <a href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">↩</a></p>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>I tend to think of texting as something that happens on a phone, which required 2G data. This only was commercially released in 1991, and wasn&#39;t immediately widespread. However, I could see someone classifying IMs as being very close to texting, and I wouldn&#39;t necessarily disagree. <a href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">↩</a></p>

<li id="fn:3">
<p>While I included phone calls and in person socializing, I&#39;m primarily thinking of written communication for the moment. Instant messaging seems quite similar to texting, so it probably shares many of these disadvantages. <a href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:4">
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that I, as a broad rule, like to keep up with a lot of people (even people I don&#39;t know very well) over long periods of time. Some of these tips are less relevant if you only want to text a couple of people, or have different preferences about how you want to text. <a href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">↩</a></p>

<p>Note that this doesn&#39;t always mean sending a reply. I could send a thumbs-up, or even ignore the message if I think that&#39;s more appropriate. <a href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text">↩</a></p>

<p>I have a general rule of trying to extend as many conversations as possible, but I will break this rule to let a flagging conversation die, especially if it&#39;s clear that the other person isn&#39;t as interested in responding. <a href="#fnref:11" title="Jump back to footnote 11 in the text">↩</a></p>

<p>It helps that I&#39;m curious about a lot of things. <a href="#fnref:12" title="Jump back to footnote 12 in the text">↩</a></p>

<p>I got this from my experience with letters. Because it takes a bit for letters to arrive, it can be healthy to write whenever you feel like it, even if you don&#39;t have a specific letter you are responding to. <a href="#fnref:13" title="Jump back to footnote 13 in the text">↩</a></p>

<li id="fn:14">
<p>I sometimes use major holidays as an excuse to reach out, but this can lead to a flood of responses which are hard to respond to. <a href="#fnref:14" title="Jump back to footnote 14 in the text">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:15">
<p>One might call this a pretext, but usually I&#39;m genuinely curious. One recent example was &#34;hey I heard you were sick. Are you okay?&#34; In any case, a pretext for communicating the underlying message of &#34;I want to continue to be friends&#34; seems harmless enough. <a href="#fnref:15" title="Jump back to footnote 15 in the text">↩</a></p>

<p>Generally though, following the tips in A and B will help make texts easier to review, especially with friends with whom you only exchange correspondence texts with. <a href="#fnref:16" title="Jump back to footnote 16 in the text">↩</a></p>
