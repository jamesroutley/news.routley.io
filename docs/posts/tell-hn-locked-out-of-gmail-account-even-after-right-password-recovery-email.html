    <h1>Tell HN: Locked out of Gmail account even after right password, recovery email</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>My mom got locked out of her 10yr gmail account. She doesn&#39;t have access to the phone number she added for 2FA. This is after she has the right password and also has access to the recovery email.<p>This basically locked her out of her whole online life because for all other social accounts she uses sign in with Google.</p><p>There is no human support, and their support website says if you cannot recover the account, create a new one.</p></div></div>
