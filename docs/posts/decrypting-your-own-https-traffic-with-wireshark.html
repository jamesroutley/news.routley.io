        <p>HTTP messages are typically are not sent in plaintext in the post-Snowden world. Instead, TLS protocol is used
to provide communications security against tampering and surveillance of communications based on HTTP protocol.
TLS itself is fairly complex protocol consisting of several sub-protocols, but let us think of it as encrypted
and authenticated layer on top of TCP connection that also does some server (and optionally client) verification through
public key cryptography.</p>
<p>In this blog, we have previously discussed setting up mitmproxy to intercept HTTPS communications between
mobile apps and their backend systems. However, we may also want to see what desktop apps are communicating.
Furthermore, we may want to go deeper into reverse engineering private APIs for web apps and would like to
surpass limitations of Chrome DevTools. This is where we turn to <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> -
a GUI tool for packet sniffing and analysis. We can use this tool for deep dive into what exactly
an application is doing on the network.</p>
<p>However if we try to sniff HTTPS without any preparations we will not be able to go far, as TLS protocol
is doing it’s job to prevent adversaries from reading communication contents by sniffing the network.</p>

<p>However, if we control one of the endpoints (i.e. desktop system with a web browser) we can set
<code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code> environment variable to a path of textfile we can access. Software that implements
TLS typically (altough not always) will write keys and other TLS secrets to this file. This applies
to curl, Chrome, Firefox and many desktop apps that use NSS/OpenSSL libraries. Wireshark, if configured
correctly, will be able to read this file and decrypt the intercepted TLS packets. This is a client-side
capture of session keys.</p>
<p>How exactly do we set the environent variable? This is dependant on operating system and whether or not
we want to cover all apps that are installed. On Linux/Unix that uses Bash we could simply put the
following line in ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">export SSLKEYLOGFILE<span>=</span>~/.sslkeyfile
</code></pre></div><p>However, this will only cover program launched directly from the shell. On Linux, we could edit
/etc/environment (or /etc/profile) and reboot to set the environment variable globally.</p>
<p>On macOS it is somewhat more complicated. First, we need to check if ~/Library/LaunchAgents directory
exists and create it under our regular user if it does not. Then we create a Property List file
(e.g. tlskeylogger.plist) with the following contents:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-8&#34;?&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &#34;-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&#34; &#34;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&#34;&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;plist</span> <span>version=</span><span>&#34;1.0&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;dict&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>Label<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>sslkeylogger<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>ProgramArguments<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;array&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>sh<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>-c<span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;string&gt;</span>
    launchctl setenv SSLKEYLOGFILE ~/.sslkeyfile
    <span>&lt;/string&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/array&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;key&gt;</span>RunAtLoad<span>&lt;/key&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;true/&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/plist&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To get it loaded on next restart, we run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/tlskeylogger.plist
</code></pre><p>To make it immediate, we run the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ launchctl start ~/Library/LaunchAgents/tlskeylogger.plist
</code></pre><p>On Windows, you can set <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code> environment variable via GUI by finding
“Edit environment variables for your account” in Windows menu and creating a new environment
variable for the current user.</p>
<p>Once this is done, we should restart browser and/or other software that communicates over HTTPS.
If everything is okay, the file should start to get populated with lines similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code># SSL/TLS secrets log file, generated by NSS

</code></pre><p>We are ready to configure Wireshark now. This is fairly simple. All we have to do is go to
(Edit -&gt;) Preferences -&gt; Protocols -&gt; TLS and put the value of <code>SSLKEYLOGFILE</code> into
“(Pre-)Master Secret Log filename”.  You should also tick checkboxes about reassembling
TLS records and application data.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.trickster.dev/2022-03-20_15.40.02.png">Screenshot 2</a></p>
<p>That is one way. Another way is to start sniffing, right click on a TLS packet, then
choosing “Protocol Preferences -&gt; Transport Layer Security -&gt; (Pre-)Master Secret Log
filename” and clicking that. Wireshark will open a textfield on the top to let you input a path
to the file that it needs to read for decryption.</p>

<p>Now we can see HTTPS messages decrypted. This includes some API calls that Google Chrome
is making when phoning back to the mothership, as well requests to Discord backend by a
desktop Discord client.</p>

<p>This opens up possibilities to not only reverse engineer web app private APIs in a deeper way, but
also to do the same kind of research against desktop apps for purposes such as data scraping,
automation, vulnerability research and privacy analysis.</p>
