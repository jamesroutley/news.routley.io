    <h1>Original Superman comic becomes the highest-priced comic book ever sold</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="text-block"><p>While cleaning out their late mother&#39;s California loft last Christmas, three brothers made a life-changing discovery under a pile of faded newspapers: one of the first Superman comics ever made. </p><p>An original copy of the June 1939 first edition on the Man of Steel&#39;s adventures, it was in a remarkably pristine condition.</p><p>Now it has become the highest-priced comic book ever sold, fetching $9.12m (£7m) at auction.  </p><p>Texas-based Heritage Auctions, which hosted Thursday&#39;s sale, called it the &#34;pinnacle of comic collecting&#34;.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The brothers found six comic books, including Superman #1, in the loft underneath a stack of newspapers inside a cardboard box and surrounded by cobwebs in 2024, Heritage said. </p><p>They waited a few months before contacting the auction house, but once they did, Heritage Auctions vice-president Lon Allen visited them in San Francisco within days, according to the auction house. </p><p>The brothers, who have chosen to withhold their names, are &#34;in their 50s and 60s, and their mom had always told them she had an expensive comics collection but never showed them&#34;, Mr Allen said. </p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a twist on the old &#39;Mom threw away my comics&#39; story.&#34;</p><p>Their mother had held onto the comic books since she and her brother bought them between the Great Depression and the beginning of World War Two, Heritage said.</p><p>Mr Allen added that the cool northern California climate was perfect for preserving old paper. </p><p>&#34;If it had been in an attic here in Texas, it would have been ruined,&#34; he said.</p><p>That helped CGC, a large third-party comics grading service, give this copy of Superman #1 a 9.0 rating on a 10-point scale, topping the previous record of 8.5. </p><p>And at its sale price of over $9m, including buyer&#39;s premium, Superman #1 easily beat the previous highest-priced comic book ever sold by $3m. </p><p>Action Comics No. 1, the 1938 work that first introduced Superman, sold for $6m last year.</p><p>The youngest brother said in a press release by the auction house that the box had remained forgotten in the back of attic. </p><p>&#34;As the years unfolded, life brought about a series of losses and changes,&#34; he said. &#34;The demands of everyday survival took centre stage, and the box of comics, once set aside with care and intention, was forgotten. Until last Christmas.&#34;</p><p>He added: &#34;This isn&#39;t simply a story about old paper and ink. This was never just about a collectible. </p><p>&#34;This is a testament to memory, family and the unexpected ways the past finds its way back to us.&#34;</p></div></div>
