          <p dir="auto">Hello MorgothSauron,</p>
<p dir="auto">Thank you very much for the link. A friend of mine suggested GMX for something free and secure. I&#39;ll certainly consider StartMail as well; I still have about two months before I pay my annual fee to protonmail, but I&#39;ve decided to leave them considering how unstable it is, especially bridge. Yes, I have experienced the same issues and there are times I move an email to another folder and it disappears!</p>
<p dir="auto">Anyway, without a commitment from protonmail to fix the problems with bridge, then aware of problems for a year, I&#39;m leaving protonmail, so thanks again for the suggestions. It should be a concern that protonmail releases a product without sufficient beta testing. I don&#39;t consider this very secure from the user&#39;s point-of-view, but I guess if emails disappear, then no one else can see them either. I don&#39;t know what the issue is with their web version, though, in the end, it was a case of really bad luck that this important email was delayed? It was part of a message I sent via another email I received, which was stored in a separate folder and not in my inbox. As I noted, in Thunderbird, if I move emails to folders, there are times that they are deleted during the transfer. If they&#39;re important, then I have to resend to myself before moving them, or make copies.</p>
