Due to a combination of poor leadership, bad planning and misfortune, Burke, Wills and their companion John King ran out of food on the return journey. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><a href="http://www.burkeandwills.net.au/Brief_History/Chapter_15.htm">They became stranded at a stream called Cooper&#39;s Creek,</a> having found no way to carry enough water to cross a stretch of desert to the nearest colonial outpost at the unpromisingly named Mount Hopeless. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;We have been unable to leave the creek,&#34; wrote Wills. &#34;Both camels are dead and our provisions are done. We are trying to live the best way we can.&#34; </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The local Yandruwandha people seemed to thrive despite the conditions that were proving so tough for Wills&#39;s party. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Yandruwandha gave the explorers cakes made from the crushed seed pods of a clover-like fern called nardoo.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Nardoo - seen floating here in the foreground - is a type of fern which is native to Australia</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Burke then fell out with them and, unwisely, drove them away by firing his pistol. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But perhaps the trio had already learned enough to survive? They found fresh nardoo and decided to make their own cakes. At first, all seemed well. The nardoo cakes satisfied their appetites, yet they felt ever weaker. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Within a week, Wills and Burke were dead. It turns out that safely preparing nardoo is a complex process.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04b1g3c">50 Things That Made the Modern Economy</a> highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.</p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Nardoo, a type of fern, is packed with <a href="https://poisonousplants.ansci.cornell.edu/toxicagents/thiaminase.html">an enzyme called thiaminase,</a> which is toxic to the human body. Thiaminase breaks down the body&#39;s supply of Vitamin B1, which prevents the body using the nutrients in food. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Burke, Wills and King were full, but starving. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Yandruwandha roasted the nardoo spores, ground the flour with water, and exposed the cakes to ash, each step making the thiaminase less toxic. <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2007/03/08/2041341.htm">It is not something one learns to do by chance.</a></p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Barely alive, King threw himself on the mercy of the Yandruwandha, who kept him alive until European help arrived months later. He was the only member of the expedition who survived.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>As a foodstuff, nardoo is a curiosity. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>The same cannot be said of cassava roots, <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/x4007e/X4007E04.htm#ch3.2.1">which are a vital source of calories in many tropical countries,</a> particularly for subsistence farmers in Africa.</p></div></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But like nardoo, cassava is highly toxic. It also requires a tedious and complex preparation ritual to make it safe. The cassava root will otherwise release hydrogen cyanide. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>What makes cassava particularly treacherous is that some processing will reduce the bitter taste and the risk of immediate cyanide poisoning. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>However, only the full, time-consuming ritual can guarantee that you will not be slowly poisoned, and develop a condition called Konzo, with symptoms including sudden paralysis of the legs.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>But in 1981, in Nampula in Mozambique, a young Swedish doctor named Hans Rosling knew none of this. As a result, <a href="https://www.damninteresting.com/the-curse-of-konzo/">the situation he faced was deeply puzzling.</a></p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>More and more people were coming to his clinic suffering from paralysis in their legs. Could it be an outbreak of polio? No. The symptoms were not in any textbook. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Thorkild Tylleskar </span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>A boy with Konzo, photographed in Zaire in September 1986</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>With Mozambique slipping into a civil war, might it be chemical weapons? </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He packed his wife Agneta and young children off to safety and continued his investigations. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Their meals of cassava had been incompletely processed.

And as a result, they developed Konzo.</p></div></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="More-things-that-made-the-modern-economy"><span role="text">More things that made the modern economy:</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Toxic plants are everywhere. Sometimes simple cooking processes are enough to make them edible. But how does anyone learn the elaborate preparation needed for cassava or nardoo?</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>No single person does, according to Joseph Henrich, an evolutionary biologist. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He argues this knowledge is cultural. Our cultures evolve though a process of trial and error analogous to evolution in biological species. Like biological evolution, cultural evolution can - given enough time - produce impressively sophisticated results. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Somebody stumbles on one step that seems to make cassava less risky; that spreads and another step is discovered. Over time, complex rituals can evolve, each slightly more effective than the last.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In South America, where humans have eaten cassava for thousands of years, tribes have learned the many steps needed to detoxify it completely: scrape, grate, wash, boil the liquid, leave the solid to stand for two days, then bake.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ask why they do this, and they will not mention hydrogen cyanide. They will simply say &#34;this is our culture&#34;. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In Africa, cassava was introduced only in the 17th Century. It did not come with an instruction manual. Cyanide poisoning is still an occasional problem; people take shortcuts because cultural learning is still incomplete.   </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Henrich argues that cultural evolution is often much smarter than we are.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Whether it is constructing an igloo, hunting an antelope, lighting a fire, making a longbow or processing cassava, we learn not by understanding from first principles, but by imitating. </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p><a href="https://psyarxiv.com/nm5sh/">One study challenged participants to place weights on the spokes of a wheel</a> to maximise the speed at which it rolled down a slope. Each person&#39;s best effort would be passed to the next person. </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>Because they benefited from earlier experiments, later participants did much better. Yet when asked, <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/nm5sh/">they showed no sign of actually understanding why</a> some wheels rolled faster than others.  </p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Further studies show that the verb to ape, meaning to copy, is ironically misplaced: the only ape with the instinct to imitate is us. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Tests reveal two-and-a-half year-old chimps and humans have similar mental capacities - unless the challenge is to learn by copying someone. The toddlers are vastly better at copying than the chimps.   </p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Getty Images</span></p></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><div><p>And humans ritualistically copy in a way that chimps do not. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0159920">Psychologists call this over-imitation.</a></p></div></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It may seem like the chimps are the smart ones here. But if you are processing cassava roots, over-imitation is exactly what you should be doing. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Over the generations our ancestors accumulated useful ideas by trial and error, and the next generation simply copied them. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>No doubt some less useful ideas were mixed in with them, like the need for a ritual dance to make the rains come, or the conviction that sacrificing a goat will persuade the volcano not to erupt. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But overall we apparently did better by copying without question than by assuming, like the chimps, that we were smart enough to tell which steps we could safely ignore. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Of course cultural evolution can take us only so far. Now we have the scientific method to tell us that, yes, we really do need to leave the cassava for two days, but, no, the volcano does not care about the goats. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>When we understand from first principles, we can make progress more quickly than by trial and error and imitation. But we should not look down on the kind of collective intelligence that saved King&#39;s life. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It is what made civilisation - and a functioning economy - possible. </p></div><section data-component="around-the-bbc"><p><h2>Around the BBC</h2></p><ul role="list" spacing="responsive"><li></li></ul></section></article></div></div>
