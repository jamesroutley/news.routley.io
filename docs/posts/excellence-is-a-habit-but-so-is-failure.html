    <h1>Excellence is a habit, but so is failure</h1>

    <p>We often hear that making small incremental improvements every day can lead to great things. This popular piece of advice rings true, and it’s a powerful reminder to keep pushing ourselves forward.</p>

<p>But there’s another side to this story that we don’t discuss as often: how incremental neglect and small missteps can accumulate and lead to negative outcomes. Recognizing and addressing these patterns of neglect early can make a significant difference in preventing larger problems down the road.</p>

<p>Reflecting on my own life, I’ve noticed that most of the things that really went off-track were indeed consequences of incremental neglect and numerous small yet poor choices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I didn’t become addicted to drugs overnight. It happened over hundreds of moments where I prioritized momentary pleasure over health and safety.</li>
  <li>I didn’t become overweight overnight. It happened over hundreds of moments where I opted for immediate gratification over long-term health.</li>
  <li>I didn’t ruin relationships overnight. It happened over hundreds of moments where I chose comfort over confronting difficult conversations, admitting my mistakes, or even just acknowledging that someone was better than me at something.</li>
</ul>

<p>From these experiences, I’ve realized that avoiding bad habits is just as important as cultivating good habits.</p>

<p>To address these kinds of issues, we must become aware of our patterns of incremental neglect and then take deliberate steps to counteract them and foster healthier habits.</p>
