          <strong>Do you ever think that copywriting has become too self-aware for
            its own good?
          </strong>
          It&#39;s like we collectively decided to drop the corporate facade of
          prestige in favor of the <em>&#34;wink wink we&#39;re fun too!&#34;</em> brand of
          language. From websites to ads to the back of shipping trucks, it
          feels like every company&#39;s identity has become a collection of short
          statements vaguely related to their industry, in pun form, devoid of
          any actual attempt at humor. It&#39;s akin to a child trying to formulate
          a joke: clearly understanding the structure and the components of
          comedy, yet missing what makes it funny. I&#39;m not saying this is
          necessarily a good or a bad thing, it&#39;s just something that I have
          noticed. It makes sense to do something like that
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xx5YqFKjTCY" target="_blank">if you&#39;re writing posters for a animated movie</a>, but when it comes to companies valued higher than the GDP of some
          countries it loses all relatability. Let&#39;s be real, if this charade of
          a website was an actual startup, we&#39;d probably wear t-shirts that say
          <em>&#34;This isn&#39;t a revolution. It&#39;s 33<span id="third">â…“</span>
            of them.&#34;</em>
          while we&#39;d get articles written about our fun company culture, the Bob
          Dylan quotes graffiti&#39;d on the wall, the meeting rooms named after
          each of the Jackson 5, and the pink neon in the entrance that says
          <em>&#34;Like a record, Baby.&#34;</em>. Oh, and while I&#39;m at it what is it
          with the period after each of those taglines? Normally I am not one to
          complain about proper punctuation but at this point it seems more like
          a thinly veiled attempt at recapturing some of that seriousness
          combined with an unwillingness to commit to the bit. Because they
          really want you to know that to them, it&#39;s not a joke. it&#39;s a
          statement.
        </p>

        <p id="oh">
          On a slightly unrelated note, I made an app that helps you
          <span id="highlight">calibrate your turntable.</span>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 id="mj">As easy as 1-2-3.</h2>

      <p>
        Do you remember the early days of the iPhone, where every once in a
        while a new app would come out and it would do just one completely new
        thing, and nothing else? There was so much excitement around finding new
        use cases and it was all
        <em>&#34;Oh yeah this is the app I use to pretend I&#39;m shaving my face. And
          this is app I use to see where the ISS is&#34;</em>. I can&#39;t remember the last time I genuinely got excited about some
        unitasker app like that and I think that&#39;s too bad. That&#39;s why Grooved
        tells you your turntable&#39;s speed <strong>in just one tap.</strong>

        Grooved does not collect any data, whatsoever. The audio stream is
        processed locally on your device and never recorded. I have no idea how
        you use the app, and to be honest I&#39;m not sure what good knowing how
        well your record player runs would be for me anyways.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grooved does not use any third party library or API, just the built-in
        components provided by Apple.
