Salovaara told Reuters the delay was because “our accounting systems needed replacement.”</p><p>“There is not any doubt over the completeness of the balance sheet, which, in turn, logically means that total revenue is also correct,” he said.</p><interaction data-token="610152711b664d000c5ab952"></interaction><p>It comes amid a challenging period for one of London’s biggest tech firms as it wrestles with regulators to secure a UK banking license. </p><p>In March, Salovaara said Revolut was “really near the very final stages”</p><p>Currently, the company only has a license in Lithuania but could soon reach a scale that causes it to fall under the aegis of the European Central Bank.</p><p>Last month, investor Schroders said it had written down its stake in the business by as much as 46%, wiping some $15 billion off its estimated value.</p><p>The Canary Wharf-based firm, which offers debit cards and crypto services to its 27 million customers, posted revenues of £636 million for the year to end-December 2021, while net profits topped £26 million, turning around a loss of £223 million the year before.</p></div></div>
