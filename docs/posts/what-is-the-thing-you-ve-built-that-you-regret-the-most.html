    <h1>Ask HN: What is the thing you&#39;ve built that you regret the most?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Given the very interesting comments on the &#34;Ask HN: What is the most impactful thing you&#39;ve built?&#34;, I was wondering about something similar: Things you regret based on ethical implications, bad technical decisions you made convinced you were right but regret/cringe about later, failures on miscalculations on budgets that provoked a bad outcome in the company etc whatever.</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p></div></div></div>
