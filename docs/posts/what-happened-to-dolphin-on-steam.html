<p>Well that blew up, huh?  If you follow emulation or just gaming on the whole, you&#39;ve probably heard about the controversy around the Dolphin Steam release and the Wii Common Key.  There&#39;s been a lot of conclusions made, and while we&#39;ve wanted to defend ourselves, we thought it would be prudent to contact lawyers first to make sure that our understanding of the situation was legally sound. That took some time, which was frustrating to ourselves and to our users, but now we are educated and ready to give an informed response.</p>
<p><a id="cuthere"></a>
We&#39;d like to thank Kellen Voyer of <a href="https://voyerlaw.com">Voyer Law</a> for providing us with legal council for this matter. And to be clear, all of the analysis below is specifically regarding US law. Without further delay, let&#39;s begin.</p>
<h3 id="what-actually-happened">What actually happened?<a href="#what-actually-happened" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>First things first - Nintendo <strong>did not</strong> send Valve or Dolphin a Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) section 512(c) notice (commonly known as a DMCA Takedown Notice) against our Steam page. Nintendo has not taken any legal action against Dolphin Emulator or Valve.</p>
<p>What actually happened was that Valve&#39;s legal department contacted Nintendo to inquire about the announced release of Dolphin Emulator on Steam.  In reply to this, a lawyer representing Nintendo of America requested Valve prevent Dolphin from releasing on the Steam store, citing the DMCA as justification. Valve then forwarded us the statement from Nintendo&#39;s lawyers, and told us that we had to come to an agreement <em>with Nintendo</em> in order to release on Steam.  Considering the strong legal wording at the start of the document and the citation of DMCA law, we took the letter very seriously.  We wanted to take some time and formulate a response, however after being flooded with questions, we wrote a <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/05/27/dolphin-steam-indefinitely-postponed/">fairly frantic statement</a> on the situation as we understood it at the time, which turned out to only fuel the fires of speculation. </p>
<p>So, after a long stay of silence, we have a difficult announcement to make.  We are abandoning our efforts to release Dolphin on Steam.  Valve ultimately runs the store and can set any condition they wish for software to appear on it. But given Nintendo&#39;s long-held stance on emulation, we find Valve&#39;s requirement for us to get <em>approval</em> from Nintendo for a Steam release to be impossible. Unfortunately, that&#39;s that.  But there are some more serious matters to discuss, some that are much bigger than Dolphin&#39;s Steam Release.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-the-key">What about the key?<a href="#what-about-the-key" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<p>Over the past few weeks, a lot has been said about Dolphin including the Wii Common Key. As you may know, Wii games are encrypted, and the Wii uses the &#34;common key&#34; that is burned into the console to decrypt Wii discs. Wii software does not have any access to the key whatsoever, however, some smart engineers and a pair of tweezers was all it took to extract the key. If you haven&#39;t heard this story before, we highly recommend <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/25c3-2799-en-console_hacking_2008_wii_fail">checking out the 25c3 presentation on the actual Tweezer Exploit that gave Team Twiizers its original name</a>.  It&#39;s an incredibly entertaining video that&#39;s worth your time.  If you aren&#39;t familiar with Team Twiizers, perhaps you know them under their modern name: <a href="https://fail0verflow.com">fail0verflow</a>.</p>
<p>The extraction of the Wii Common Key did not elicit any kind of legal response from anyone.  It was <a href="https://hackmii.com/2008/04/keys-keys-keys/">freely shared</a> <em>everywhere</em>, and eventually made its way into Dolphin&#39;s codebase <a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/commit/6ff164585ce5b63ef91a4c6635e35a7fe938ea1f">more than 15 years ago</a> (committed by a Team Twiizers member no less). </p>
<p>These keys have been publicly available for years and no one has really cared.  US law regarding this has not changed, yet a lot of armchair lawyers have come out talking about how foolish we were to ship the Wii Common Key.  Fueling this is Nintendo&#39;s letter to Valve, which cites the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201">17 U.S.C. § 1201</a>), particularly because Dolphin has to decrypt Wii games. </p>
<blockquote>Wii and Nintendo GameCube game files, or ROMs, are encrypted using proprietary cryptographic keys. The Dolphin emulator operates by incorporating these cryptographic keys without Nintendo’s authorization and decrypting the ROMs at or immediately before runtime. Thus, use of the Dolphin emulator unlawfully “circumvent[s] a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under” the Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(1). Distribution of the emulator, whether by the Dolphin developers or other third-party platforms, constitutes unlawful “traffic[king] in a[] technology . . . that . . . is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure . . . .” 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2)(A).<sup>3</sup></blockquote></div></div>
