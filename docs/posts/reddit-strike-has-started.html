        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p>Due to slow rollout on reddit&#39;s side, some subreddits may flash public and private, if this is happening, it
            means that the subreddit just changed their publicity type.</p>

        <p>Any subreddits which have just disabled posting will still be displayed as
            &#34;Public&#34;.</p>
	
	<h3>Third party instances:</h3>
<p>These are instances of Reddark hosted by individuals unrelated with UNTONE. If the main server isn&#39;t working, these may be a good choice, though click with caution.</p>
