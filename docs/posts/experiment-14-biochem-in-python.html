<p id="baa7"><a href="https://github.com/msrobot0/llmlexperiments/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Check out the code</a></p>



<p id="df43">I was having a conversation the other day with a friend who said LLMs were all trained on stolen data. I said yes — this is called “primitive accumulation” — it is the origin of capitalism.</p>

<p id="f1ad">But I am not really interested in LLM content generation for our future when we all sleep in pods, matrix style, hooked up to vr headsets watching AI generated entertainment that will probably be better than some entertainment today (reality tv for example).</p>



<p id="7514">What I AM interested in is the relationship between LLMs and engineering and how LLMs can insert itself into the engineering process. Build me a component that does X. This can be an electrical component, a chemical component, a mechanical component, a programming component. My experiments have been programming components since this is what I understand. But I have also been studying phytochemistry- not much — so I really dont know anything.</p>



<p id="b673">But I was looking at methylation and wanted to experiment with that.</p>



<p id="4f4c">I asked:</p>



<p id="5432">The result was a junky non interactive diagram generated by python.</p>

<p id="089b">I prompted</p>



<p id="215b">And you know what — I got a really sort of fun- but sort of useless interactive diagram. It took a few prompts to fix because it was using Jupyter notebooks and I was not, but FUN!.</p>



<p id="0fa9">Take a look at the html code in the git repo — I am into this.</p>



<p id="1d4b">I also wanted to generate the actual methylation process — ideally as an animation with bonds coming and going but this was not as successful and I gave up.</p>

<p id="4873">The amino acid tryptophan is crucial for serotonin production in the gut.</p>







<p id="0d73">&gt;The methylation of tryptophan to form methylated tryptophan involves the addition of a methyl group (CH3) to one of the carbon atoms in the tryptophan molecule. Specifically, the process involves the methylation of the indole ring in tryptophan. Here’s an intermediate step-by-step explanation of how this methylation process happens:</p>



<p id="a991">1. **Tryptophan Structure**:</p>



<p id="a18c">“`</p>



<p id="9d6b">2. **Methyl Group Addition**:</p>



<p id="efaf">“`</p>



<p id="40f6">3. **Methylated Tryptophan**:</p>



<p id="c39d">“`</p>



<p id="9cdc">In a biological context, the methylation of tryptophan is catalyzed by specific enzymes. The exact mechanism and location of methylation can vary depending on the specific enzyme and the organism in which it occurs. Methylation reactions are essential for various biological processes, including the modification of amino acids, nucleotides, and other biomolecules, which can have significant impacts on cellular function and gene regulation.</p>



<p id="21f3">When I asked it to generate python I got this addtion</p>



<p id="d06d">1. We create a molecule object for tryptophan using its SMILES notation.</p>



<p id="1337">Please note that this is a simplified representation of the methylation process. In a biological context, methylation is a complex enzymatic process that can involve specific enzymes and co-factors. This code only illustrates the addition of a methyl group to a specific carbon atom for demonstration purposes.</p>



<p id="bba8">## Other Packages</p>



<p id="ce61">&gt;There are several Python packages and libraries that are widely used for biochemical synthesis, analysis, and visualization. These packages provide tools for various tasks related to biochemistry, from structural analysis to data visualization. Here are some of the most popular ones:</p>



<p id="24b5">1. **RDKit**: The RDKit is a comprehensive cheminformatics library that allows you to work with chemical structures, fingerprints, and molecular data. It’s widely used in drug discovery and biochemical analysis. It provides functions for chemical structure handling, substructure searching, and more.</p>



<p id="26e7">– GitHub: [<a href="https://github.com/Teichlab/PySCeNe](https://github.com/Teichlab/PySCeNe)" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/Teichlab/PySCeNe](https://github.com/Teichlab/PySCeNe)</a></p>



<p id="42ab">These libraries cover a wide range of tasks in biochemistry, from structural analysis and molecular dynamics to bioinformatics and network analysis. Depending on your specific needs, you can choose the libraries that best suit your projects.</p>



<p id="c647">&gt; any more?</p>



<p id="0ade">ChatGPT</p>



<p id="f6f5">Certainly, there are more Python packages for biochemical synthesis, analysis, and visualization. Here are a few additional libraries and tools that you might find useful:</p>



<p id="e1e4">11. **ChemPy**: ChemPy is a Python library for modeling and simulating chemical kinetics. It’s particularly useful for modeling chemical reactions and reaction networks.</p>
