    <h1>To make more Stingers, US needs to revive production technology from scratch</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h2><strong>It is not easy to restart old production lines – after most of them have been disassembled and the technology itself was largely forgotten. Therefore, in order to make Stinger portable missile launchers (MANPADS) which became incredibly popular after their <a href="https://www.technology.org/2023/03/11/defender-of-ukraine-learned-to-shoot-down-helicopters-by-watching-online-videos/">particularly effective use in Ukraine</a>, the United States needs to <a href="https://www.defenseone.com/business/2023/06/raytheon-calls-retirees-help-restart-stinger-missile-production/388067/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find specialists</a> who still know the essence of making this weapon.</strong></h2>

<p>These man-portable anti-aircraft missile systems were manufactured from approximately 1970s to 1980s. So the country has found a clever solution – the retired experts will be returning to production in order to train the younger generation on how to manufacture this weapon.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the Stinger man-portable anti-aircraft missile system has been demonstrated in Ukraine. This led RTX (formerly named Raytheon) to restart the production of these missiles, which the Pentagon has not purchased for several decades.</p>

<p>The production of the first model, FIM-92A commenced in 1978. Five years later, an enhanced version called the FIM-92B, featuring a new seeker, entered production. The last units of both the FIM-92A and FIM-92B were made in 1987, with approximately 16,000 missiles manufactured in total.</p>
<p>Since then, several upgrades followed, but the latest version that entered the testing phase – RMP Block II – was never manufactured as the project got canceled due to budgetary limitations. That basically means that not a single stinger has been produced for over 20 years.</p>
<p>According to U.S. data, as of June 9, 2023, the United States together with its NATO allies has sent over 2000 Stinger MANPADS to Ukraine from their stockpiles since the Russian Federation started the full-scale invasion. There, these weapons were highly effective, which sparked a renewed interest in this relatively old military development.</p>

<p>To replenish its own stocks, the U.S. Army placed an order for 1700 new Stinger launcher units back in May 2022. However, the Pentagon reported that it would take as long as 30 months (or two and a half years) for the completed MANPADS to start rolling off the assembly line.</p>
<p>The reason behind this lengthy timeframe is quite straightforward—several components for these MANPADS are no longer in production, necessitating the exploration of new methods and possibly novel technological improvements to resume production and increase its rates in the nearest time.</p>
<p>As an example, American engineers have encountered difficulties in manufacturing the homing heads for these MANPADS, so this component will potentially require conducting research and developing replacement modules.</p>

<p>“Some of the components are no longer commercially available, and so we’re going to have to go out and redesign some of the electronics in the missile of the seeker head. That’s going to take us a little bit of time,” said the President of RTX. </p>
<p>In order to revive Stinger production, the company has recruited retired engineers who will train current employees in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>RTX President Wes Kramer stated, “We were bringing back retired employees that are in their 70s … to teach our new employees how to actually build a Stinger. We’re pulling test equipment out of warehouses and blowing the spider webs off of them.”</p>
<p>However, even despite these significant efforts, resuming production is expected to be a slow process. Kramer mentioned that the company is required to redesign boards and certain other components, all of which take a significant amount of time. So it is quite possible that the first updated Stinger units will appear in service only in 2026.</p>
