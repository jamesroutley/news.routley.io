      <h2> Overview </h2>
      <p> PUB was an early <em> scriptable markup language</em>. It was similar in concept to today&#39;s web scripting languages, especially PHP
        and JavaScript. But, like Microsoft Word, its purpose was to create paginated documents.
        PUB was the brainchild of <a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/les-earnest/"> Les Earnest </a> (also see <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/">his own page</a>) of the <a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/"> Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>. Under his direction, I designed the language and implemented the compiler in
        1971. It ran on the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/DEC/pdp-10/dec.pdp-10.the_evolution_of_the_DECsystem_10.1978.102630382.pdf">PDP-10</a>. </p>
      <p> PUB&#39;s intended users were computer programmers working at the AI Lab. The brand
        new <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/october-29-1969-happy-40th-birthday-to-a-radical-idea/">ARPANET</a> made it easy to transmit the PUB application, source code, and documents to
        other research universities, several of which had PDP-10 systems. In
        the next few years, dozens of Ph.D. candidates around the U.S. chose
        PUB to format their dissertations. <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~rht/">Russ Taylor</a> of Stanford modified the open source to add support for the Information International
        Inc. <a href="https://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/acl/technology/fr80/p010.htm">FR-80 Microfilm Recorder</a>. Rich Johnsson of Carnegie-Mellon University (CMU) did the same for the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc320/"> Xerox Graphics Printer</a> (XGP), a predecessor to the laser printer.</p>

      <p>Examples of documents which used PUB:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://exhibits-lb.stanford.edu/cs/catalog/tf421vy6196">Info and sample sheets for Xerox Graphics Printer (XGP); notes on how to use with PUB</a>, July 1980.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.ifarchive.org/if-archive/infocom/info/MDL_Programming_Language.pdf ">The MDL Programming Language</a> manual, Stu Galley and Greg Pfister. Laboratory for Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, June 1979. The manual documents the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/957199.804725">Muddle</a> interpreter version 55 (ITS) and version 105 (TENEX and TOPS-20).</li>
      </ul>

      <p> PUB offered considerable power. But its target audience was small. The software
        was ridden with quirks that only became apparent after running the compiler
        and examining the output. </p>
      <p> At least two PUB users reacted to these shortcomings by developing a better
        language. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/30408.30413">Brian Reid</a>, then at CMU, developed  <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA125287.pdf">Scribe</a> for nontechnical users. He implemented the first version (Cafe) entirely in PUB (see &#34;<a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA125287.pdf">Chapter 9: An Evaluation of the System</a>&#34; on page 110 of <i>Scribe: A Document Specification Language and Its Compiler</i>). <a href="https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">Don
        Knuth</a> developed <a href="https://tug.org/whatis.html">TeX</a> for authors of mathematical texts. </p>
      <p> The solution I favored was what we would now call a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG"> WYSIWYG</a> interactive text editing and page layout system. I felt that, if the effect
        of any change was immediately apparent, users would feel more in control.
        I soon left Stanford to pursue my dream at Xerox PARC (<a href="https://cceckman.com/larry-tesler-consulting/1962-1980">1973-80</a>) and Apple
        Computer (<a href="https://cceckman.com/larry-tesler-consulting/1980-1997">1980-1997</a>). </p>
      <p> In 1980, Les Earnest founded <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2013/05/102746589-05-01-acc.pdf"> Imagen</a>, a pioneering desktop publishing company. He <a href="https://history.computer.org/annals/dtp/seybold-seminar-1988-smaller.pdf">sold it to QMS in 1987</a>. </p>
      <p> PUB is all but forgotten. It is not even mentioned in most histories of Scribe and
        TeX. But its reinventions, JavaScript and PHP, have become indispensible
        in the world of web authoring. As such, history has confirmed what Les
        postulated at least as early as 1971: built-in markup tags will never
        be able to handle the variety of formatting effects that authors and
        publishers require. To achieve effects that a markup language designer
        could not have anticipated, a powerful scripting language should be provided. </p>

                                 PUB

                        The Document Compiler



                                 by

                            Larry Tesler







ABSTRACT:

PUB  is  an  advanced  text  justifier  and  page  formatter intended
primarily for use by programmers.  It can automatically number pages,
sections, figures,  footnotes, etc.  and can  print their  numbers in
roman numerals as well as  in digit or letter form.  It  can generate
cross references,  tables of contents,  and indexes.  Page  layout is
flexible,  and  allows  multiple  column  output.    Line  formatting
includes tabs, underlining, superscripts, subscripts,  centering, and
justification.   Macros programmed  in a  SAIL-like string-processing
language can generate text to be printed in the document.  The output
of the compiler is  a file which can  be printed on the  terminal, on
the line printer, or on microfilm.





ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:

Les  Earnest  created  the  concept  of  the  Document  Compiler  and
specified most of its capabilities.

Dan  Swinehart  provided  invaluable advice  and  aid  throughout the
development of PUB.

Russ Taylor programmed the FR-80 preprocessor.

      <p> <em> SAIL </em> was an acronym with two meanings: <em> Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory </em> and <em> Stanford Artificial Intelligence Language</em>. The SAIL language <em> (see <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/ai/catalog/np036rx9092">original manual</a> and <a href="http://i.stanford.edu/TR/CS-TR-73-373.html">CS-TR-73-373 report</a>) </em> was a dialect of <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/367236.367262"> Algol-60</a>. </p>
      <p> I worked at SAIL, the lab, as a consultant in 1967, and as an employee of <a href="https://edu-cyberpg.com/Linguistics/Parry.html"> Kenneth Colby, M.D.</a>, from 1968 to mid-1970. </p>
      <p> Around 1968, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Warren_(computer_specialist)"> Jim Warren </a> and I were laying out the <a href="http://midpeninsulafreeu.com/"> Midpeninsula Free University </a> catalog using traditional cut-and-paste methods, i.e., with scissors and glue.</p>
       <p> I had been involved in computer animation since 1962 when I worked on
        the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN1opFMXJbY"> Stanford Card Stunt Program</a>. I had used graphic displays since at least 1963 when the <a href="https://history.nih.gov/display/history/Laboratory+Instrument+Computer"> LINC </a> came to Stanford. I had recently seen a demo of <a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/doug-endelbart/"> Doug Engelbart</a>&#39;s hypertext system, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLS_(computer_system)"> NLS</a>. It was obvious to me that cut-and-paste would eventually be done using a computer
        display and something like a mouse. I mentioned this thought to Jim,
        who knew nothing about computers at the time. He asked to visit SAIL,
        where I showed him the facility and such toys as <a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/steve-russell/"> Steve Russell</a>&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!"><em>SpaceWar!</em></a>, the first video game. That visit led to Jim&#39;s entry into the computer industry.
        For me, it reinforced a desire to make interactive page layout a reality. </p>
      <p> In 1970, I became disillusioned with the slow pace of artificial intelligence
        research. I took almost a year off from the industry. When I returned
        in the spring of 1971, I asked if I could work on something unrelated
        to AI. <a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/john-mccarthy/"> Prof. John McCarthy</a>, inventor of <a href="https://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/lisp20th/lisp20th.html"> LISP </a> and academic leader of the lab, sent me to Les Earnest, the lab&#39;s administrative
        head. Les suggested a few possible projects. The one that interested
        me the most was his idea for a document compiler for technical manuals.
        I told Les that I&#39;d rather implement an interactive layout system for
        a broader audience. He persuaded me that the document compiler should
        come first. I felt I&#39;d learn useful things, and I needed the job, so
        I agreed. </p>
      <p> Les specified the general approach and most of the features. As I designed and
        implemented PUB, I naturally put my own spin on it. Once people began
        using it, features were driven mainly by user feedback. </p>
      <p> I released the first version of PUB around September, 1971. The implementation
        language was SAIL, and the syntax of the scripting language was as SAIL-compatible
        as I could manage. </p>
      <p> Les deserves credit for the strengths of PUB, and I the blame for its quirks. </p>

      <h2> About this manual </h2>
      <p> <strong> To navigate the manual, scroll down, or use the links in the table of contents
          and index. Many, but not all, pages have commentary alongside. </strong> </p>
      <p> The original PUB manual contained no links. PUB did not support hypertext. Its
        purpose was to generate printed documents. </p>
      <p> The manual was first produced in late 1971. The manual reproduced here is a
        1972 revision that included documentation of a few added features, including
        output to the FR-80<em>. </em> </p>
      <p> The <a href="https://www.saildart.org/allow/sail-charset-utf8.html"> character set </a> of the SAIL keyboard and display was not fully supported by the lab&#39;s high-speed
        impact printer. In the hard copy manual, I had to hand print some non-ASCII
        characters. For this HTML reproduction, I have translated those characters
        to Unicode. I have also corrected a number of typos in the text and examples. </p>
      <p> The cover image is a Hieronymous Bosch woodcut of an English pub. I found the
        image in 1971 in an off-copyright book in the Stanford Library. It became
        the cover of the hard copy version of the manual. We had no way to incorporate
        the image into the digital version. </p>
      <p> The digital version of the manual survived thanks to <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/ai/catalog/qs288bj9626"> Bruce Baumgart</a>, who laboriously transferred all SAIL backup tapes from the period 1972 to 1990
        into a <a href="https://www.saildart.org/"> web-based archive</a>. At the time of this writing, February 2005, Bruce is an employee of <a href="https://archive.org/"> The Internet Archive</a>, and plans to add the SAIL archive to their holdings. </p>
      <p> The manual was, naturally, produced in PUB. We have not yet located the source
        code, but expect to find it soon. </p>
      <p> It took considerable JavaScript and CSS machinations to emulate the behavior
        of SAIL&#39;s line printer in HTML. The manual is best viewed in Microsoft
        Internet Explorer for Windows, FireFox, or Safari. In older browsers,
        you may see mispositioned characters as well as numerous backquotes where
        there ought to be spaces. Even in the recommended browsers, many non-ASCII
        characters will appear too wide. </p>

      <h2> Antecedents and contemporaries </h2>
      <p> PUB was by no means the first computer-based markup language. </p>
      <p> In 1963, Jerry Saltzer developed <a href="https://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/AH.9.01.html"> RUNOFF</a>, the first known computer-based system in which an author could insert markup
        codes into a digital manuscript and run the file through a markup processor
        to generate a formatted document. Around the same time, inspired by a
        demo of RUNOFF or a similar program, <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2019/09/102738273-05-01-acc.pdf"> John Seybold </a> founded a typesetting service bureau, ROCAPPI (1963-70). <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8509537"> ROCAPPI </a> is said to have developed powerful editing and layout systems and even a form
        of generic markup. </p>
      <p> RUNOFF spawned <a href="https://www.troff.org/papers.html"> Joe Ossanna&#39;s troff/nroff </a> (1973), later enhanced by <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Ebwk/"> Brian Kernighan</a>, co-developer of Unix and C, and still popular on Unix systems. IBM&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCRIPT_(markup)"> SCRIPT</a>, released circa 1967, had a similar syntax to RUNOFF. By 1974, SCRIPT had spawned
        the PUB-like NSCRIPT and <a href="https://csg.uwaterloo.ca/sdtp/watscr.html"> Waterloo Script</a>, as well as the <em> generalized markup language, </em> <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/access/text/2018/10/102738489-05-01-acc.pdf/"> GML</a>. </p>
      <p> Before GML, most markup was <em> specific</em>, e.g., <em> indent the next line 3 spaces</em>. In GML, which was conceived in 1969 and realized in 1971, all markup was <em> general</em>, e.g., <em> make the next line a heading</em>. A document thus prepared could be formatted for different page sizes, different
        output devices, etc., without altering the markup. </p>
      <p> GML was concerned with the syntax of a <em> document type</em>, which it expressed in a standardized form, the <em> document type definition </em> or <em> DTD</em>. The syntactic rules governing a new structural element could be defined in
        a DTD. Its implementation required recoding of the markup processing
        application. </p>
      <p> PUB, SCRIPT, and other scripted markup languages provided a form of generic
        markup using macros. In PUB, new elements and new behavior could, in
        many cases, be defined within the PUB language itself. As stated earlier,
        Brian Reid&#39;s SCRIBE-a complete markup language-was originally implemented
        in PUB. Similarly, IBM&#39;s first version of GML was implemented in SCRIPT. </p>
      <p> In 1978, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Goldfarb"> Charles Goldfarb</a>, the principal developer of GML, joined with other advocates of generalized
        markup to begin work on SGML. SGML has become a widely used language
        for describing industrial documents. In 1990, <a href="https://computerhistory.org/profile/tim-berners-lee/"> Tim Berners-Lee </a> chose SGML as the basis for his World Wide Web hypertext language, <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/1995-archive/html-spec.html"> the original HTML</a>. The success of HTML spawned XML, now (February 2005) the favored format for structured data exchange. </p>
      <p> Was any feature of PUB without precedent? I do not know enough about the features
        of similar systems in 1971 to be sure. I am hoping that readers of this
        manual can help me answer this question. </p>

                            INTRODUCTION




1.1 PURPOSE
<span>    _______

               PUB is a compiler which translates a manuscript into a
<span>                                                    __________
               document.
<span>               ________

               A &#34;manuscript&#34; is an SOS file containing the text of a
               publication interspersed  with control  characters and
               commands.  The function of the compiler is  to arrange
<span>                                              ________
               this text  on formatted pages  under the  direction of
               the control characters and commands.

               Output  is  written  on a  &#34;.DOC&#34;  file  known  as the
               &#34;document&#34;.  TYPE, SPOOL  or PRINT it.   Under certain
               conditions, the document can be edited with  TECO (see
               Section 7.16), but it is wiser to make  corrections in
               the manuscript and then rerun the compiler.

1.2 CAPABILITIES
<span>    ____________

               PUB provides the usual capabilities of a  simple text-
               justifier, including:

&gt;Page numbering
&gt;Optional justification to the right margin
&gt;Centering of titles
&gt;Headings and footings
&gt;Control of Spacing and Indentation
&gt;Underlining

               In  addition,   it  features   advanced  documentation
               capabilities, such as:

      <h2> Terminology </h2>
      <p> The name <em> PUB </em> was short for <em> PUBlication language</em>. </p>
      <p> The PDP-10 operating system was <a href="https://opost.com/tenex/"> TENEX</a>, later called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOPS-10"> TOPS-10</a>. </p>
      <p> <em> SOS </em> (Son of Stopgap) was a line-oriented text editor. For more information about
        PUB, SAIL, SOS, and related topics, see Les Earnest&#39;s extensive but concise
        memoire, <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~learnest/sail/sailaway.htm"> SAIL Away</a>. </p>
      <p> <a href="https://almy.us/teco.html"> TECO </a> was a character-oriented text editor, originally developed in 1962-63 for the
        DEC PDP-1. <a href="https://www.opost.com/dlm/"> Dan Murphy </a> developed TECO and was one of the developers of TENEX. </p>
      <p> The TENEX <em> TYPE </em> command displayed a file on the terminal, which, at SAIL, was a display that
        every programmer had on his desk-a rare indulgence at the time. The <em> PRINT </em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spooling"> SPOOL </a> commands sent a document to the line printer. </p>
      <p> &#34;The usual capabilities of a simple text-justifier&#34; refers to preexisting markup processors like RUNOFF. </p>
      <h2> PHP remark </h2>
      <p> The advice that &#34;it is wiser to make corrections in the manuscript and then rerun the compiler&#34; would apply today to the HTML output from PHP. </p>

1.3 OPERATION
<span>    _________

               The compiler is &#34;two-pass&#34;.  The first pass interprets
               the manuscript and outputs several  intermediate files
               with  extensions  &#34;.PUG&#34;,  &#34;.PUZ&#34;,   and  &#34;.PUI&#34;.  The
               second pass is a separate program automatically called
               which  makes one  pass  through the  &#34;.PUI&#34;  files and
               produces the  document.  The  &#34;.PUG&#34; and  &#34;.PUZ&#34; files
               are automatically deleted at the end of Pass One.  The
               &#34;.PUI&#34;  files  are  read  by  Pass  Two,  then deleted
               (unless deletion is waived by a switch setting  -- see
               below).

               The first pass typically requires 40K of core and runs
               at the rate of  15 pages per minute.  The  second pass
               needs 18K  and runs  at 50 pages  per minute.   If the
               system should crash during  Pass Two, and you  wish to
               restart without rerunning Pass One,  R PUB2.  &#34;R PUB2&#34;
               also gives you  an opportunity to specify  a different
               output device than originally requested.

               You may run the document compiler with or without RPG.
               A manuscript file which  is &#34;.PUB&#34; or a  document file
               extension  which  is  &#34;.DOC&#34;  need  not  be mentioned.
               Examples:

      <h2> Terminology </h2>
      <p> <em> Core </em> meant <em> magnetic core memory</em>, the prevalent technology before the invention of semiconductor memory. Even
        today, Unix systems are said to &#34;dump core&#34; to disk when unable to recover from an error. </p>
      <p> <em> 40K </em> meant 40x1024 words. A PDP-10 36-bit word could hold five 7-bit ASCII characters
        or four 9-bit SAIL characters. In units of eight-bit bytes, PUB needed
        330K of available memory. </p>
      <h2> Why two passes were necessary </h2>
      <p> There were several reasons that PUB required two passes. Pass 1 generated front
        matter such as the Table of Contents that Pass 2 had to output before
        other pages. Pass 1 determined the targets of cross references so that
        Pass 2 could fill them in. </p>
      <p> Pass 1 automatically ran Pass 2, but the user could run Pass 2 separately to
        generate output for another device. </p>

1.4 COMPILER OUTPUT
<span>    ________ ______

               During Pass one, whenever  PUB reads a &#34;Page  Mark&#34; or
               Form Feed,  it types out  the manuscript  page number.
               During Pass Two, whenever  PUB writes a Form  Feed, it
               types out  a count  of the number  of output  pages so
               far.

               During Pass  One, PUB also  types out  error messages.
<span>```````````````After each``message, an arrow``(<span>→</span>) or a``question mark</span>
               (?) is typed  out.  You may  then respond as  in SAIL.
               If you are not  familiar with SAIL, here is  a summary
               of responses:

       &lt;CR&gt;        Continue compiling after this error.
       &lt;LF&gt;        Continue compiling,  and after  subsequent errors,
               continue automatically.
           NOTE: The above two responses are not valid after &#34;?&#34;
E&lt;file&gt;&lt;CR&gt;        Edit file &lt;file&gt;.
      E&lt;CR&gt;        (RPG only) Edit the manuscript file.
      S&lt;CR&gt;        Start Over.

               In DEBUG mode (the /D switch), some error messages are
               also output in the right margin of the document.

               Whenever PUB prints a line number in an  error message
               or in the right margin  of the document, it is  of the
               form:
&lt;file id&gt;&lt;line no.&gt;/&lt;page no.&gt;[&lt;macro line no.&gt;/&lt;macro page no.&gt;]

               If the line is from the manuscript, then  &lt;file id&gt; is
               empty.  If  it is  from another file  (such as  one of
               those &#34;.PUG&#34; files mentioned above), then &lt;file id&gt; is
               the  first three  letters of  the first  name  of that
               file.

               If the file is  in SOS format, then the  &lt;line no.&gt; is
               always  five  digits,  including  leading   zeroes  if
               necessary.  If it is from a TECO or TVEDIT  file, then
               PUB  generates  line  numbers  1, 2, 3,  etc.  without
               leading zeroes.  If it is from a &#34;.PUG&#34; file, then the
               &lt;line no.&gt;  is  the  line  number/ page  number  of  a
               relevant  line in  your  manuscript or  in  some other
               source file.

      <p> <a href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:pq252ks2028/pq252ks2028.pdf"> TVEDIT </a> (1963 or 1965) was a display-oriented text editor originally developed by Brian Tolliver
        for the Stanford PDP-1. Pentti Kanerva ported it to the PDP-10 around
        1969 and made a number of improvements. It was a little less powerful,
        but more user-friendly, than <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs-paper.html#SEC24"> EMACS </a> (1974). </p>

        <p> Pentti&#39;s version of TVEDIT had an <em> oops </em> command that restored <em> deleted </em> text to the location of the cursor. To move text, the user issued a <em> delete </em> command, repositioned the cursor, and issued an <em> oops </em> command. </p>
        <p> That trick gave me the idea of using <em> cut and paste, </em> not only to position blocks of lines from a galley proof onto a page, but also

1.5 READING THIS MANUAL
<span>    _______ ____ ______

               This manual is ordered  such that as soon as  you have
               learned enough of the system to solve  your particular
               problem, you can skip the rest of the manual.  Read at
               least  through  Section  2.3  before  making  any such
               assumption.

               In  describing  the   syntax  of  PUB   commands,  the
               following meta-linguistic symbolism is employed:

      &lt;...&gt;        These  brackets delimit  the name  of  a syntactic
               entity
      [...]        These delimit optional components of the command
    ...|...        This character separates alternatives for the same
               command component

               Cross-references  in  this  document  are   always  to
               subsections.   Subsection numbers  are printed  at the
               bottom of each page.



1.6 TUTORIAL FOR BEGINNERS
<span>    ________ ___ _________

               PUB is a  string processing language.   Characters can
               be  formed into  words, words  into lines,  lines into
               paragraphs,  paragraphs  into  columns,  columns  into
               &#34;areas&#34; (such as the title areas at the top and bottom
               of the page),  areas into pages, pages  into sections,

               sections  into  &#34;portions&#34;  (such  as  the   Table  of
               Contents  or  the  Appendices),  and  portions  into a
               document.  The  methods of  bulding larger  units from
               smaller  ones are  flexible and  under control  of the
               programmer.

               The most trivial  use of PUB  is to create  a document
               that is  exactly identical  to the  manuscript, adding
               only  headings  and footings.   PUB  assumes  that the
               format of each output  page is as follows.   The first
               three lines are a Heading area of which only the first
               is usually used.   The next 48  lines (lines 4  to 51)
               are the Text area.  Line 52 is blank and line 53  is a
               Footing area.   The Footing area  is for  page numbers
               and  other reference  information, not  for footnotes.
               (Footnotes are  placed inside  the Text  area, towards
               its bottom).

               The width of each page is assumed to be 69 characters.
               It is assumed  that there is  only one column  of text
               output.  Therefore, the longest an output line  can be
               is 69 characters.

               The  number  of  lines in  each  area,  the  number of
               columns of text, and the number of characters  in each
               column  may be  changed by  declaration.   See Section
               6.7 and  Section 7.13  for details.   If all  you want
               to do is widen the page, e.g., to 75  characters, then
               make the following line the first of the manuscript:
.PAGE FRAME 53 HIGH 75 WIDE

               The &#34;Dot&#34; in column one indicates that this line  is a
               Command Line for PUB to obey and should not be printed
               in  the document.   If  you would  rather  a different
               character in column  one served for this  purpose, see
               Section 2.2.

               PUB assumes  that you want  no headings  and footings.
               It  will leave  the  heading and  footing  areas blank
               unless  you specify  otherwise.  The  simplest  way to
               specify  headings and  footings is  with  the standard
               macros  &#34;EVERY  HEADING&#34; and  &#34;EVERY  FOOTING&#34;.  These
               macros can specify a title for the left  edge, center,
               and right  edge of  the heading  area and  the footing
               area.  For example, the macro call:
.EVERY HEADING(PRELIMINARY REPORT,PARACYBERNETIC PHENOMENA,1972)

      <h2> The Document Object Model (DOM) </h2>
      <p> PUB did not have a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-DOM-971009/"> document object model </a> as powerful as that of DHTML. But it did have a hierarchy of elements, at the
        top of which were <em> portions</em>. Portions were major document divisions like the Table of Contents, the main
        body of text, and the Index. </p>
      <p> Like JavaScipt, PUB offered the ability to append text, with or without markup,
        to elements. PUB offered both a simple and a fancy method of appending
        to elements. </p>
      <p> In the simple method, text without markup (i.e., after markup had been applied)
        was appended to the current line, lines were appended to the current
        paragraph, etc., up the hierarchy to the current portion. Today, pure
        HTML without scripts operates the same way. </p>
      <p> In the fancy method, one portion, usually the main body of text, sent text with
        unapplied markup to another portion. For example, the main body could
        send an entry to the Table of Contents, Bibliography, or Index. In pass
        2, the receiving portion processed the markup as if it had been part
        of its original source code. In JavaScript today, a similar process applies
        when a script uses the <em> writeln </em> function to add markup to a related document in a <em> frame. </em> </p>
      <p> The PUB compiler had no predefined notion of a table of contents, bibliography,
        or index. The author could define as many portions as desired, with their
        format and structure determined by the script and the markup. </p>
      <h2> Page layout in PUB vs. RUNOFF </h2>
      <p> Instead of PUB&#39;s <em> page frame, </em> RUNOFF had distinct <em> line length </em> and <em> paper length </em> commands. </p>
      <p> In RUNOFF, the <em> header </em> command took one argument. Alignment was determined by a separate <em> heading mode </em> command. The <em> page </em> command and its partner, <em> paging mode</em>, controlled the printing of page numbers. PUB combined and generalized these
        facilities. </p>
      <h2> The <em> dot </em> convention </h2>
      <p> The dot convention originated in RUNOFF. Successors such as SCRIPT, GML, and
        troff followed suit. Commands had to start on a new line. </p>
      <p> PUB supported both command lines that began with a dot and intra-line switching
        between command mode and text mode. </p>
      <p> TeX (1978) and SGML (1986) dropped the dot convention completely, and allowed
        markup to appear anywhere. </p>

               will print  on the  top line of  every page  the three
               titles shown.

               To make the top  line of every page display  the title
               &#34;PRELIMINARY REPORT&#34; on the left and the  current date
               on the right, use:
.EVERY HEADING(PRELIMINARY REPORT, ,{DATE})

               The  consecutive commas  indicate that  the  center is
               empty.   The  curly  brackets  around  the  word  DATE
               specify that  DATE is  not a title  to be  printed but
               rather a variable to be evaluated.

               To make the number of each page appear  bottom center,
               use:
.EVERY FOOTING(,{PAGE},)

               To learn about fancier headings and footings, you will
               have to read most of this document, especially Section
               7.5 and Section 10.2.

               PUB will  number your pages  1, 2, 3, etc.  unless you
               declare otherwise.   To learn  how, see  Section 6.11.
               A new page  of output will be  started for one  of two
               reasons: the previous page is full, or a page-changing
               command  is executed.   The most  common page-changing
               command is:
.NEXT PAGE

               This always starts  a new page,  even if one  was just
               started and nothing is on it yet.  To start a new page
               only if there is something on the current page, use:
.SKIP TO COLUMN 1

               To leave a few blank lines in the document, use:
.GROUP SKIP 10

               The SKIP command is described in Section 7.12.

               PUB processes text a  paragraph at a time.   The usual
               way  to  indicate  the  end  of  a  paragraph  in your
               manuscript is by a blank line (that is, just a  CR and
               LF).   Oher  ways  are  discussed  elsewhere  in  this
               manual, beginning at Section 2.3.

               Usually, PUB packs a paragraph as tightly  as possible
               by  filling  up  each output  line  with  words before

      <h2> More about page layout in PUB vs. RUNOFF </h2>
      <p> RUNOFF supported header text but not footer text. PUB symmetrically supported
        both. </p>
      <p> The RUNOFF equivalent to <em> next page </em> was <em> begin page</em>. I adopted <em> next x </em> as a uniform way to start a new element at any level of the hierarchy. </p>
      <p> Unlike RUNOFF, PUB supported multiple columns per page. But the word <em> column </em> in the <em> skip to column </em> command referred to <em> character position</em>, i.e., distance from the left margin. </p>
      <p> One application of the <em> group skip </em> command was to leave space for a hand-pasted illustration. </p>

               beginning a new line.  This is called &#34;filling&#34;.  Then
               PUB inserts extra spaces between words to  eliminate a
               ragged right edge from the paragraph.  This  is called
               &#34;justifying&#34;.

               PUB  will  not  indent the  first  line  of paragraphs
               unless an  indent command  appears in  the manuscript,
               e.g.:
.INDENT 6

               To learn more  about indentation and  related matters,
               see Section 6.4 through Section 6.7.

               PUB assumes you would like your text lines  filled out
               and justified.  You  can selectively exempt  blocks of
               your manuscript from this fate.  Each such  block must
               be delimited by  &#34;.BEGIN&#34; and &#34;.END&#34;.   After &#34;BEGIN&#34;,
               specify a formatting mode to persist for  the duration
               of the block.  Examples:

Fill, but don&#39;t Justify    Don&#39;t even fill   Copy verbatim
<span>_____ ___ _____ _______    _____ ____ ____   ____ ________
.BEGIN NOJUST              .BEGIN NOFILL     .BEGIN VERBATIM
   ...                        ...               ...
.END                       .END              .END

               In  &#34;NOJUST&#34;  mode,  lines  will  be  filled  but  not
               justified.   In  &#34;NOFILL&#34; and  &#34;VERBATIM&#34;  modes, they
               will  not  even  be  filled.   The  difference between
               NOFILL and  VERBATIM is that  VERBATIM is  both faster
               and dumber.  It is faster because it copies  the lines
               of the manuscript  to the document without  looking at
               them, except to see if  there is a dot in  column one.
               It  is  dumber  because  it  does  not  recognize text
               control characters  that PUB normally  recognizes, and
               it does  not reformat in  any way.  Thus,  VERBATIM is
               used to  copy blocks of  manuscript that  are arlready
               formatted perfectly.

               Filling allows  the manuscript to  be quite  ragged, a
               great  convenience   in  editing.   Short   lines  are
               lengthened and long  lines are shortened.   Be careful
               in NOFILL or VERBATIM mode that no manuscript  line is
               longer than 69 characters (or whatever limit  you have
               declared), or  some of  it will be  lost and  an error
               message given.

It has been observed that the Sigma 3 in Horsetown, Mass. and the
CDC 6600 in Liverless, Cal. tend to have parity errors at the same
time.  When records were compared by
Miss Minnie Messer, Director of the Horsetown Chamber of Commerce
Computation Facility,
and Mr. Solomon Crunch of Liverless Hospital&#39;s Organ-Transplant
Inventory Project, it was shown that
the correlation of parity error occurrences was 0.8, with a
probability of random coincidence of &lt;.00000001.

Miss Messer and Mr. Crunch revealed these discoveries at the
Universal Users Union meeting in Cranchville, Tenn. after they
arrived two hours late for Mr. Crunch&#39;s scheduled talk there.
They said that in the excitement of discovery
the meeting slipped their minds.

This report has motivated this author to undertake
a wider survey to determine if similar
phenomena have occurred elsewhere.  The author has
solicited Miss Messer&#39;s assistance in this survey,
but without the cooperation of the entire computing community,
it is unlikely that sufficient
data
can be collected.  Therefore, we request that interested
parties tabulate the exact times of occurrence of parity
errors on their computer during the 7 day period
1200 April 18 to 1200 April 25 and send it to:

                          TEXT CONVENTIONS




2.1 ILLEGAL CHARACTERS
<span>    _______ __________

               If the following  characters occur in  the manuscript,
               they may cause problems:

       &#39;177        Rubout
       &#39;175        Altmode
        &#39;13        Vertical Tab

               These characters are ignored in the manuscript:

         &#39;0        Null
        &#39;14        Form Feed  (except after  LF, where  it is  a page
               mark)

               A  manuscript   prepared  using   SOS  or   TVEDIT  is
               legitimate  if  it has  no  vertical tabs.   If  it is
               prepared using TECO, be  sure as well that  every line
               ends with CR LF.

               Tabs are expanded to the appropriate number of spaces,
               as in the line editor.



2.2 COMMAND AND TEXT LINES
<span>    _______ ___ ____ _____

               Every line with a  dot (&#34;.&#34;) in column 1  is processed
               as a command line.  Every other line is processed as a
<span>                    _______ ____
               text line.
<span>               ____ ____
               If you would prefer a different character to introduce
               command lines, e.g., $, use the command:
COMMAND CHARACTER &#34;$&#34; ;

2.3 PARAGRAPHING
<span>    ____________

               The  text  is   processed  in  logical   units  called
               &#34;paragraphs&#34;.   A  paragraph  is  the  accumulation of
               words from one or  more text lines, terminated  by the
               occurrence of a paragraph break.
<span>                               _________ _____
               A paragraph break can  be caused by the  command BREAK
<span>                 _________ _____
               as well as by several other commands.  In  addition, a
               paragraph break can be caused by signals in the text.

               Paragraphing conventions can  be varied by the  use of
               various mode and switch settings.



2.4 FILL MODE
<span>    ____ ____

               In FILL mode, the  compiler puts as many words  as can
               fit on each output line before beginning a new line --
               each line is &#34;filled&#34; with words.

               For convenience of  exposition, names have  been given
               to the  parts of  the output  paragraph in  FILL mode.
               The first line  is called the  crown, and the  rest of
<span>                                              _____
               the lines are called the vest.  It is common to indent
<span>                                        ____
               the  crown and  not  the vest,  or vice  versa,  or to
               indent them different  amounts.  The last line  of the
               vest is called the hem.  While the other lines  of the
<span>                                  ___
               paragraph  can be  subject to  justification,  the hem
               line is never justified.



2.5 JUSTIFICATION
<span>    _____________

               In FILL mode, whether or not output lines are
               justified to the right margin is determined by the
               setting of the &#34;ADJUST-NOJUST&#34; switch; but the hem
               line is never justified in any case.

2.6 BREAKING AT BLANK LINES
<span>    ________ __ _____ _____

               In FILL mode,  a BREAK is  caused by every  blank line
               (just CR-LF).  Redundant  blank lines have  no effect.
               To disable this response, see Section 10.1.



2.7 BREAKING AT TABS
<span>    ________ __ ____

               Tabs are converted to an appropriate number  of spaces
               by  PUB.   If  you  would like  a  single  tab  at the
               beginning of a text  line to cause a  paragraph break,
               put this command at the beginning of your manuscript:
.TABBREAK

               This  makes text  lines  that are  indented  exactly 8
               spaces  cause  a  break.   Since  an  initial  TAB  is
               converted  to  8  spaces,  it  will  also  break.  The
               inverse of TABBREAK is TABSPACE.



2.8 BREAKING AT CARRIAGE-RETURNS
<span>    ________ __ ________________

               In  FILL mode,  PUB usually  converts  every carriage-
               return at the end of a text line to a space.  If it is
               at the  end of a  sentence, it converts  the carriage-
               return to two spaces.  If you would rather  that every
               carriage-return ending a text line caused  a paragraph
               break, use this command:
.CRBREAK

               The inverse of CRBREAK is CRSPACE.



2.9 NOFILL MODE
<span>    ______ ____

               In  NOFILL mode,  one input  line produces  one output
               line, even if it falls far short of the  right margin;
               if  the line  is too  long, characters  will  be lost.
               Every  carriage-return ending  a text  line  in NOFILL

               mode causes a  paragraph break.  The  commands ADJUST,
               CRSPACE, and TABBREAK do not affect this mode.

               NOFILL  mode  has  several  variations,  which  differ
               mainly in the final treatment of the output line:

               NOFILL: (Standard variation) No special treatment.

         CENTER: Center the output line between the margins.

                      FLUSH RIGHT: Shove it against the right margin.

FLUSH LEFT: Shove it against the left margin.

JUSTJUST:    Justify    it    by    the    insertion    of    spaces.

VERBATIM: Copy text lines to output exactly as written,
                 without changing
<span>```indentations.``Ignore all control characters {<span>α</span><span>↑</span>[#]&amp;<span>↓</span><span>β</span>\<span>∂</span>-<span>∞</span><span>←</span><span>→</span>.</span>
            Dot in column 1   still signals a command line.
        This mode speeds text processing
                                 when no formatting is needed.

               SUPERIMPOSE  [n]:  Suppress the  LF  after  each line,
               except every n&#39;th line.
<span>&lt; <span>↑</span> &lt; ! <span>≡</span> <span>∩</span> <span>⊂</span> ~ % 7 Z</span>
<span>| <span><span>↓</span> &gt; ? / <span>∪</span> <span>⊃</span> . \ - -</span>



2.10 HORIZONTAL SPACE COMPACTION
<span>     __________ _____ __________

               In COMPACT  mode, redundant spaces  in the  input line
               are discarded.        In      RETAIN  mode,       they
               are           retained.

               More precisely, in COMPACT mode, a sequence of  two or
               more spaces is reduced to one space, except at the end
               of a sentence, where it is only reduced to two spaces,
               and at the beginning of a text line, where  all spaces
               are discarded.  Of  course, spaces may  be re-inserted
               during justification.

2.11 VERTICAL GROUPING
<span>     ________ ________

               In GROUP mode, all  output lines are forced  to appear
               in an unbroken column.  Its inverse is APART mode.  If
               the bottom of the output page is encountered  while in
               GROUP mode, the whole group is moved to the top of the
               next column or page.

               It is  unwise to use  GROUP mode for  more than  a few
               lines  that  must  appear  undivided  in  the  output.
               Example:

.GROUP
EQUATION 6
  m = vt
.APART
               This would prevent &#34;Equation 6&#34; from appearing  at the
               bottom  of one  page and  &#34;m = vt&#34; at  the top  of the
               next.



2.12 MODE AND SWITCH SETTING COMMANDS
<span>     ____ ___ ______ _______ ________

               The  commands that  select the  paragraphing  mode are
               FILL,  NOFILL,   CENTER,  FLUSH  RIGHT,   FLUSH  LEFT,
               JUSTJUST,  VERBATIM,  and  SUPERIMPOSE  [n],  where  n
               [optional] is any &#34;SAIL&#34; expression.

               The  commands  ADJUST  and  NOJUST  set  the FILL-mode
               justification  switch.   TABBREAK,  TABSPACE, CRBREAK,
               and CRSPACE control  the reaction to initial  tabs and
               to carriage-returns in FILL mode.

               The  commands  RETAIN  and  COMPACT,  GROUP  and APART
               select the space compaction and column grouping modes.

               At the  outset of compilation,  the settings  in force
               are:
.FILL    ADJUST    TABSPACE  CRSPACE   RETAIN    APART

               WARNING:  Switching  to  NOFILL  or  to  any   of  its
               variations  automatically  switches  to  RETAIN  mode.
               This  can be  overridden by  following the  command by
               COMPACT.

        e.g., GROUP and NOGROUP. Paul Heckel paid me a visit one day in 1971
        to inform me that someone had hired him to develop software whose functionality
        was between that of RUNOFF and PUB. He begged me to make my command suite
        a superset of his. I foolishly succumbed to the pressure. </p>
      <p> Ironically, Paul&#39;s project was canceled before I completed PUB. If he had informed
        me, I could have restored parsimony. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <h2> Digression </h2>
        <p> Years later, Paul wrote a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0782115381/?v=glance"> book </a> on friendly software design, which I endorsed. More irony. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2> Elements and Tags </h2>
      <p> Like RUNOFF and GML, and unlike SGML and HTML, PUB had no uniform tag syntax
        with which to bracket elements. </p>

2.13 WORD BREAKS
<span>     ____ ______

               The compiler  processes the  input paragraph  in units
               called  words.   A  &#34;word&#34;  is  roughly  defined  as a
<span>                       _____
               sequence  of  consecutive  visible  characters.   More
               precisely, the compiler concatenates characters into a
               word until the occurrence of a word break.
<span>                                              ____ _____
               A  word  break is  normally  signalled by  any  of the
               following in a text line:

&gt;A space (or a sequence of spaces)
&gt;A carriage-return (the end of an input line)
<span>&gt;The control character <span>β</span>, if activated (as well as some others)</span>

               Word breaks serve two functions.

               (1) FILLING:  In generating  an output  paragraph, the
               compiler puts as  many words as  can fit on  each line
               before beginning a new line.  The paragraph  will only
               be divided for this purpose at word breaks.

               (2) JUSTIFYING:  During  justification,  extra  spaces
               will only be inserted at word breaks.



2.14 CONTROL FUNCTIONS
<span>     _______ _________

               Several control  functions can  be invoked  by control
               characters in the text line.  The user can  choose the
               characters he  wishes to  serve these  functions.  For
               simplicity  of exposition,  a suggested  character has
               been designated for each function.

               The following control functions are available.  If the
               description  states: &#34;BLA  mode only&#34;,  then  in other
               modes, the character is treated no differently than an
               alphanumeric.

<span>``````````<span>β</span>````````Cause a word <span>β</span>reak.</span>

<span>``````````<span>α</span>````````Pretend the``next character is``<span>α</span>lphanumeric (this</span>
               lets you slip in control characters);

      <h2> Special characters in PUB </h2>
      <p> α in PUB served the same purpose as backslash ( \ ) in many modern languages.
        It escaped the next character. </p>
      <p> # was like <em> &amp;nbsp; </em> (non-breaking space) in HTML. </p>

                   (1) If followed by two or more  spaces, COMPACTion
               only reduces the spaces to two instead of one.
                   (2) If followed by a carriage-return, replaces the
               CR by two spaces instead of one.

2.15 CONTROL CHARACTER ACTIVATION
<span>     _______ _________ __________

               At  the  outset  of  compilation,  the   only  control
               characters  recognized are  the punctuators  &#34;.&#34;, &#34;!&#34;,
               and &#34;?&#34;  when they appear  at the end  of a  word, and
               hyphen (&#34;-&#34;) when it appears in the middle of  a word.
               NOTE: Not even  &#34;{&#34; is recognized unless  you activate
               it.  However, &#34;}&#34; is permanently active, because it is
               not  a text  control  character but  really  a command
               language delimiter.

               To turn  on any control  function using  its suggested
<span>```````````````character (&#34;<span>α</span>&#34; for example), use the command:</span>
<span>.TURN ON &#34;<span>α</span>&#34;</span>

               To  activate the  control function  using  a different
<span>```````````````character, such as &#34;%&#34; or &#34;<span>β</span>&#34;, write:</span>

<span>.TURN ON &#34;<span>β</span>&#34; FOR &#34;<span>α</span>&#34;</span>
               To  de-activate a  control character,  such as  &#34;?&#34; or
               &#34;%&#34;, use:

.TURN OFF &#34;?&#34;
.TURN OFF &#34;%&#34;

               One TURN command  may have several  operands separated
               by commas:
<span>.TURN ON &#34;%&#34; FOR &#34;<span>α</span>&#34;, &#34;@&#34; FOR &#34;<span>←</span>&#34;, &#34;<span>→</span>&#34;, &#34;\&#34;</span>

               The latter may be abbreviated:
<span>.TURN ON &#34;<span>↑</span><span>↓</span>[]_&amp;&#34;</span>

               There  is a  subtle problem  that arises  when control
               characters have been turned on inside a macro  and the
               macro wants to turn off only the ones that  weren&#39;t on
<span>```````````````previously. ``If``it``has``done``a ``TURN ON &#34;<span>↑</span>&#34;,``for</span>
<span>```````````````example,``it can``not undo``it with``TURN OFF &#34;<span>↑</span>&#34;, for</span>
               that would  always TURN it OFF  whether or not  it was
               originally on.   There are  two ways  to do  it right.
               One is to use  block structure (see Section  5.2), but
               sometimes  this  is impossible,  because  blocks cause
               paragraph breaks.  The other way is to use the command
               TURN ON|OFF  without  arguments.   Its  effect  is  to
               cancel  the previous  TURN ON|OFF that  had arguments,
               was  in  the  current  block,  and  has  not  yet been
               cancelled.

               For purposes of smooth exposition, in the rest of this
               manual it is assumed  that you have turned on  all the
               control   functions   and  used   all   the  suggested
               characters for them.  Remember, though, that  only the
               punctuators   are   turned  on   unless   you  command
               otherwise!

               It  is  recommended   that  you  don&#39;t  turn   on  any
               characters  except  in  short  blocks  where  you know
               you&#39;ll remember they&#39;re  on.  Ideal places  are inside
               macro bodies (See Section 3.1).

2.16 COMPUTED TEXT
<span>     ________ ____

               The  control  character  &#34;{&#34;  will  switch  to command
               processing right in the  middle of a text  line.  This
               allows the execution of any PUB commands without first
               causing either a paragraph break or a word  break.  If
               you want a word break before the {, force it  by means
<span>```````````````of a <span>β</span> or a space.</span>

               The command  most commonly executed  after &#34;{&#34;  is the
               Computed Text Command.   A variable, a constant,  or a
<span>               ________ ____ _______
               parenthesized  expression  occurring  in  isolation is
<span>               _____________
               evaluated and its string value is then scanned  by the
               text scanner as text.  Example:

<span>A = {A}, and B = <span>↓</span>_{(2+2)}_<span>↓</span>.</span>

<span>```````````````If``the value``of A``was the``string &#34;<span>∪</span>3&#34;,``this would</span>
               output:

A = 3, and B = 4.
<span>    _          _
               Caution: If  a {...} construct  extends onto  a second
               input  line, be  sure to  begin the  continuation line
               with a &#34;.&#34; -- or you won&#39;t be in the command scanner!

               Caution: A string constant following the word BEGIN is
               considered a block name, as in SAIL, and  not computed
               text.  If you  put computed text after  BEGIN, precede
               it by a semicolon.

               Note that a &#34;}&#34; (which  can not be TURNed ON  and OFF)
               switches to text processing from command processing at
               any time.   This allows  a Short Text  Line to  be put
<span>                                          _____ ____  ____
               right into a command line:
.NOFILL }I am a short text line.{BREAK FILL

               which is the compact equivalent of:

.NOFILL
I am a short text line.
.FILL

               To  summarize,  there  are  two  ways  to  switch from
               command to text processing:

                               MACROS




3.1 CALLING A MACRO FROM A COMMAND LINE
<span>    _______ _ _____ ____ _ _______ ____

               It  is  common  to  repeat  an  identical  sequence of
               commands many times in a manuscript, e.g.,
<span>.FILL ADJUST COMPACT TURN ON &#34;<span>∂</span>{<span>α</span><span>β</span>&#34;</span>

               You could define the following macro:
<span>.MACRO FAC <span>⊂</span> FILL ADJUST COMPACT TURN ON &#34;<span>∂</span>{<span>α</span><span>β</span>&#34; <span>⊃</span></span>

               and  then  whenever   you  want  the   whole  sequence
               executed, write simply:
.FAC

<span>```````````````The``body of``the macro``enclosed between``<span>⊂</span> and``<span>⊃</span> is</span>
               substituted  for  its  name and  then  scanned  by the
               command scanner.

               A macro may also have arguments:
<span>.MACRO T(CHR) <span>⊂</span> NOFILL TURN ON &#34;CHR&#34; <span>⊃</span></span>

               which when called by:
<span>.T(<span>α</span>)</span>

               expands to:
<span>. NOFILL TURN ON &#34;<span>α</span>&#34;</span>



3.2 CALLING A MACRO FROM A TEXT LINE
<span>    _______ _ _____ ____ _ ____ ____

               It is  also common  to repeat  an awkward  sequence of
               control characters many times in the manuscript, e.g.,
<span>X<span>↑</span>i&amp;<span>↓</span>[j,k]</span>

               You could define the following macro:
<span>.MACRO XIJK <span>⊂</span>&#34;X<span>↑</span>i&amp;<span>↓</span>[j,k]&#34;<span>⊃</span></span>

               but to call it you must get to the command scanner:
{XIJK}

                              3.1 - 3.2

               When  the  body  is  substituted  for  the  name, this
               becomes a string constant inside curly brackets:
<span>{&#34;X<span>↑</span>i&amp;<span>↓</span>[j,k]&#34;}</span>

               so it  is considered computed  text and is  scanned by
               the text scanner, producing the output:

 i
X
 j,k

               Again, parameters can be used:
<span>.MACRO S(X,I,J,K) <span>⊂</span>&#34;X<span>↑</span>i&amp;<span>↓</span>[j,k]&#34;<span>⊃</span></span>

               If called by {X(i,j,k)} this would expand to  the same
               as above, but called by
{S(Y,t,t1,URG)}

<span>```````````````it would expand to &#34;Y<span>↑</span>t&amp;<span>↓</span>[t1,URG]&#34; which would output:</span>
 t
Y
 t1,URG

               Some macros are  declared for you in  an automatically
               loaded  file  PUBSTD.DFS  (see  Section  7.5).   Other
               useful macros are  declared in a file  PUBMAC.DFS that
               you can REQUIRE (see Section 7.11) to be  loaded; they
               are described in PUBMAC.TES[UP,DOC].



3.3 TEMPLATES
<span>    _________

               A  &#34;template&#34; occurs  as a  part of  several commands,
               including  the  macro declaration,  and  requires some
               explanation.  Its purpose is to store away a  piece of
               program for later, instead of immediate, execution.
        Syntax:
<span><span>⊂</span> &lt;piece of program&gt; <span>⊃</span></span>

               The &lt;piece  of program&gt;  may include  other templates,
               and may  span several  lines.  However,  several rules
               should be followed:

               (1) The  template should  begin and  end on  a command
               line.

<span>```````````````(2) Every <span>∃</span> or unpaired``<span>⊂</span> or <span>⊃</span> must be preceded``by a</span>
<span>```````````````<span>∃</span>.</span>

               (3)  People  who  change  COMMAND  CHARACTER  in  mid-
               manuscript,  note:  the  character  beginning  command
               lines within the template  must be the one  current at
               the time  of declaration --  not the one  current when
               you invoke it later.



3.4 MACRO DECLARATION
<span>    _____ ___________
        Syntax:
MACRO &lt;name&gt; [&lt;formal parameters&gt;] [;] &lt;template&gt;

               The &lt;name&gt; may be one or two identifiers.  The &lt;formal
               parameters&gt; if present, are in the following form:
<span>(``[<span>ε</span>]&lt;identifier&gt;``, ...``)</span>

<span>```````````````Each parameter preceded by <span>ε</span> is a value parameter, and</span>
<span>                                                 _____
               when called, the actual parameter that  corresponds is
<span>```````````````<span>ε</span>valuated``and``the``value``is``substituted``for``each</span>
               occurrence in the &lt;template&gt; of the &lt;id&gt;.  Every other
               parameter  is  a  literal  parameter,  and  the actual
<span>                                 _______
               parameter is substituted unevaluated.  Example:
<span>.MACRO PLUG IN(X, <span>ε</span>Y) <span>⊂</span> &#34;X --- Y&#34; <span>⊃</span></span>

               If called by: {PLUG IN(Peter Pauper, V)} where V  is a
               variable whose current value is &#34;Henrietta&#34;, the macro
               expands to: {&#34;Peter Pauper --- Henrietta&#34;}



3.5 MACRO CALLS
<span>    _____ _____

               A macro can be called from anywhere in a  command line
               as well as  inside curly brackets  on a text  line.  A
               value  parameter  must  be  a  &#34;SAIL&#34;  expression (see
               Section 4.1), while  a literal parameter may  take any
               of three forms (form 2 is recommended):

          (1) A string enclosed in  &#34;...&#34; in which every &#34;  inside is
                represented by &#34;&#34; . It must appear all on one line.

          (2) A string enclosed in  |...| in which no |  appears.  It
                may span several command lines.

                              3.4 - 3.5

          (3) A string  not beginning with &#34;  or | and  containing no
                comma or  right parenthesis.  It  must appear  all on
                one line.  Leading spaces are ignored.

               Thus, all the folowing are equivalent:

PLUG IN (&#34;Peter Pauper&#34;, V)
PLUG IN (|Peter Pauper|, V)
PLUG IN ( Peter Pauper, V)
&#34;Peter Pauper --- Henrietta&#34;



3.6 OMISSIONS
<span>    _________

               Any actual parameter may be omitted; its value is then
               NULL.  Furthermore, if  all parameters that  follow it
               are  also omitted,  all their  terminal commas  may be
               omitted.

               In a macro call --  but not in a macro  declaration --
               the parentheses around  the actual parameter  list may
               be omitted (both -- not just one).  However, care must
               be taken  if this is  done.  In particular,  the comma
               that follows  each parameter must  appear on  the same
               line  as  the  parameter.   Also,  the  third  form of
               literal  parameter   may  not   contain  any   of  the
               following:
<span>,``)``]``;``}``<span>⊂</span>``CR</span>

               This  convention  is  useful  for  macros  to generate
               section headings; a typical call is:
.SEC SPECIAL FEATURES

               which is equivalent to:
.SEC(|SPECIAL FEATURES|)

               and  would presumably  go to  a new  page,  update the
               section number, print  the heading centered,  and send
               it to the Table of Contents for inclusion  there.  How
               to do all this will unfold gradually.

3.7 RECURSIVE MACROS
<span>    _________ ______

               If  a macro  is declared  &#34;RECURSIVE MACRO  ...&#34;, then
               when  its  call  occurs   in  the  FALSE  part   of  a
               conditional,   the  compiler   processes   the  actual
               parameters  as usual,  but does  not expand  the macro
               body.  Instead, the whole call is replaced by NULL.

               For macros  not declared  RECURSIVE, their  bodies are
               expanded  even in  the  FALSE part  of  a conditional.
               This  prevents  syntactic anomalies,  but  attempts at
               recursion will create infinite looping.

               Recursive macro hackers: If you call a RECURSIVE macro
               after a conditional statement, an empty statement must
               intervene:
.IF A&lt;0 THEN B ELSE C ; ; RECMAC(...) ;

4.1 DATA TYPE
<span>    ____ ____

               PUB has only one data type: String.  A string consists
<span>                                           ______
               of zero or more ASCII characters.

               Strings may participate in arithmetic operations.  The
               string &#34;764&#34; is automatically converted to the integer
               764 for this purpose.  The result of the  operation is
               similarly converted back to a string.  Because of this
               convention,  the  data  type  Integer  exists  for all

               practical purposes.



4.2 VARIABLES
<span>    _________

               Variables may be declared by the command:
.VARIABLE A, BETA, C

               This would make A, BETA, and C local to  the innermost
               block   in  which   the  declaration   occurred.   The
               variables are of course type String.

               Any  variable that  is  assigned but  not  declared is
               automatically Global.
<span>                             ______
               All declared  variables  are initialized to  NULL, the
               string of length zero.

               The name  of a variable  is an identifier.   The first

               character  of an  identifier  should be  a  letter The
               letter may be followed  by letters, digits, _,  and !.
               The identifier is  terminated by any  other character,
               including CR.  Before  looking up an identifer  in its
               symbol table,  PUB changes all  lower case  letters to
               upper case and changes _ to !.

4.3 AUTOMATICALLY DECLARED VARIABLES
<span>    _____________ ________ _________

               Some variables are  automatically declared for  you by
               the compiler, in a block outside your outermost block.
               A few of these are read-only -- it is not  possible to
               assign them a value by an assignment statement.

       CHAR        (read-only)  The  number  of  characters   so  far
               printed  on  the  current  output  line,  not counting
               justification   spaces.    This   is    sometimes   an
               overestimate.
       LINE        (read-only) Value  is zero  if the  current output
               column is empty.  Otherwise, the sequential  number of
               the last line output.
     COLUMN        (read-only) Value is  zero if the current  page is
               empty.  Otherwise  the sequential  number of  the last
               column in which output went.
      CHARS        (read-only)  The  number  of  character  positions
               remaining to be filled on the current output line.
      LINES        (read-only) The  number of unused  lines remaining
               in the current output column.
    COLUMNS        (read-only) The number of unused columns remaining
               in the current page.
    TOPLINE        (read-only)  The  line number  on  this  page that
               starts the current area.  (see Section 6.7).
    FILLING        (read-only) FALSE (&#34;0&#34;) if in a NOFILL mode.  TRUE
               if in FILL mode -- &#34;1&#34; if ADJUST, &#34;-1&#34; if NOJUST.
       NULL        (read-only) The empty string (&#34;&#34;).
       TRUE        (read-only) &#34;-1&#34;
      FALSE        (read-only) &#34;0&#34;
     SPREAD        The intra-paragraph output line spacing.  SPREAD=1

               is single  spacing, SPREAD=2  is double  spacing, etc.

               Its initial value  is 1 unless otherwise  specified in

               the (nS) CUSP option.
    INDENT1, INDENT2, INDENT3    Control  paragraph  indentation (see
               Section 6.4).

    FOOTSEP        Before the first footnote (if any) in each column,
               a blank line is usually left. This is  because FOOTSEP

               then that string will be printed instead.



4.4 SIMPLE EXPRESSIONS
<span>    ______ ___________

               Most of the  SAIL &lt;string expression&gt; syntax  has been
               implemented.   Exceptions:  function  designators (but
               there are macro calls); exponentiation; LDB, ILDB, and
               LOP; shifts and masks; LEAP operators.

<span>```````````````PUB``has``three``unary``operators``of``its ``own:``&#34;<span>↑</span>&#34;</span>
               capitalizes its argument (only lower case  letters and
               underbar are affected).   EVEN and ODD  are predicates
               which  tell  whether the  low  order bit  of  the last
               character of  a string  is off or  on.  They  are used
               primarily to distinguish left and right facing pages:
.IF ODD PAGE THEN etc.

               All the  available operators are  listed in  the table
               below.  If operator  op1 is listed above  operator op2
               then op1 is performed before op2.

4.5 GENERAL EXPRESSIONS
<span>    _______ ___________

               Assignment expressions and conditional expressions are
               allowed.  If used alone to compute text,  enclose them
               in  parentheses,  otherwise  they  will  look  to  the
               compiler  like  assignment  statements  or conditional

               statements, and  the text  processor won&#39;t  scan their
<span>               __________
               values.

               In syntactic descriptions,  &lt;e&gt; will denote  a general
               expression  --  simple,  assignment,  or  conditional,
               while &lt;se&gt; will denote a strictly simple expression.

4.6 CONSTANTS
<span>    _________

               PUB  recognizes  three  forms  of  constants:  quoted,
               decimal, and  octal.  WARNING:  CR will  terminate any
               form, so  don&#39;t continue  a quoted  constant on  a new
               line.

               A quoted constant  (&lt;qc&gt;) is a sequence  of characters
               surrounded by quotes  (&#34;...&#34;).  To include a  quote in
               the represented string,  write two quotes (&#34;&#34;)  in the
               constant.

               A  decimal constant  (&lt;dc&gt;) is  a sequence  of decimal
               digits.

               An octal constant (&lt;oc&gt;) is an apostrophe (&#39;) followed
               by a sequence of octal digits.  The value of the octal
               number is  taken modulo  200  and  converted to  a one
                                           8
               character ASCII string.  The following octal codes are
               illegal: &#39;0, &#39;11-&#39;15, &#39;175, &#39;177.

                              SECTION 5

                             STATEMENTS




5.1 STATEMENT TYPES
<span>    _________ _____

               Syntactically,   any  command   can  be   a  statement
               (abbreviated  &lt;s&gt;  in  this  manual).   There  are two
               categories of commands: declarative and imperative.  A
               declaration  is   limited  in   its  scope   by  block
<span>               ___________
               structure, while an imperative isn&#39;t.
<span>                                   __________


5.2 BLOCK
<span>    _____
        Syntax:
BEGIN [&lt;qc&gt;] &lt;s&gt; ; ... END [&lt;qc&gt;]

               The optional block name  [&lt;qc&gt;] should be the  same in
               both  places.   Mismatches will  be  flagged.  Missing
               END&#39;s are calamitous to say the least!

               Note  that declarations  don&#39;t  have to  be  the first
               thing in the block.  The scope of a declaration is the
               remainder of the innermost block in which it occurs.

               Both BEGIN and  END cause a paragraph  break.  Neither
               produces output, not even a blank line.

               The semicolons  between statements  may be  omitted as
               long as no ambiguity is presented thereby.



5.3 COMPOUND STATEMENT or CLUMP
<span>    ________ _________ __ _____
        Syntax:
START [&lt;qc&gt;] &lt;s&gt; ; ... END [&lt;qc&gt;]

               Declarations are  not local to  clumps, and  START and
               END never break.  Thus:
.IF TRUE THEN START FILL ; ADJUST END ;

               sets the  modes FILL  and ADJUST  and leaves  them set
               after END.  If BEGIN  had been used instead  of START,
               the scope  of the  modes would  have extended  only to
               END.



5.4 ONE PARAGRAPH SCOPE
<span>    ___ _________ _____
        Syntax:
ONCE

               The command ONCE breaks and begins a local scope which
               is  implicitly  terminated  by  the  end  of  the next
               paragraph.  There must not be an END provided to match
<span>                                      ___
               it.   If a  BEGIN  is encountered  before  a paragraph
               breaks, then everything that has been declared  in the
               ONCE&#39;s scope  is donated to  the scope of  the BEGIN&#39;s
               block and the ONCE is forgotten.  Examples:

.ONCE FLUSH RIGHT
George
               is equivalent to:

.BEGIN FLUSH RIGHT
George
.END
               and

.ONCE FILL
.BEGIN NOJUST
Harry
.END
               is equivalent to:

.BEGIN FILL NOJUST
Harry
.END

               You  will find  the ONCE  construct useful  in writing
               macros  and  in  formatting  odd  paragraphs  here and
               there.  Note that ONCE is a complete statement, unlike
               BEGIN, which  introduces a  statement that  extends to
               the matching END.  Thus,  you can say &#34;IF X  THEN ONCE
<span>```````````````ELSE i<span>←</span>i+1&#34; but``you can&#39;t say``&#34;IF X THEN``BEGIN ELSE</span>
<span>```````````````i<span>←</span>i+1&#34;.</span>

                            DECLARATIONS




6.1 SCOPE
<span>    _____

               (For the third time:) A declaration is in  force until
               the occurrence of  an overriding declaration  or until
               the end  of the innermost  block in which  it occurred
               (see Section 5.2 through Section 5.4).



6.2 MODE DECLARATIONS
<span>    ____ ____________

               Most of these have already been described.   Some mode
               declarations  cause paragraph  breaks and  some don&#39;t.
               The ones that first Break are: FILL, all  the NOFILLs,
               ADJUST, NOJUST, GROUP, and APART.  The ones that don&#39;t
               are: CRBREAK, CRSPACE, COMPACT and  RETAIN.



6.3 TABS DECLARATION
<span>    ____ ___________
        Syntax:
TABS &lt;e&gt;, ...

               The  expressions  are  sorted  in  algebraic ascending
               order  and  duplicates  are  eliminated.   These  then
               become the tab stops for the \ control  character.  If
               you tab when the  target is already passed,  no spaces
               are  inserted, but  justification to  the left  of the
               current  position  in  the  output  line  is inhibited
               anyway.   Tab  distances are  measured  from  the left
               margin.

        Syntax:
INDENT [&lt;e&gt;] [ ,&lt;e&gt;] [,&lt;e&gt;]

               This command can change the values of three parameters

               INDENT3.   They  can  also  be  changed   directly  by
               assignment statements.  Every  change is local  to the
               current block.

                    INDENT1  and INDENT2  specify indentation
                         from the left margin.

                    INDENT1 specifies the value of  the crown

                    In  NOFILL,  SUPERIMPOSE,   and  JUSTJUST
                         modes,  INDENT1  is   observed,  and
                         INDENT2 is  ignored.  Old  PUB users
                         note: this is a change from previous
                         conventions.

                    INDENT3  specifies  indentation  from the

                         ignored in NOFILL modes, and in text

6.5 PREFACE DECLARATION
<span>    _______ ___________
        Syntax:
PREFACE &lt;e&gt;



               PREFACE  N will  cause  every output  paragraph  to be
               preceded by  an implicit SKIP  N.  There  are actually
               two Preface  numbers maintained --  one for  FILL mode
               and one for NOFILL modes.  The one you change  by this
               command depends on the current mode.



               Initially,  the  FILL  Preface  is  1  and  the NOFILL
               Preface is 0.

               You may want to vary the Prefaces according to SPREAD,
               e.g., PREFACE 1+SPREAD .

               These are standard macros that set SPREAD to 1, 2, and
               3, respectively.  At the end of the current block, the
               old value  is restored.   SPREAD controls  the spacing

               assumed 0.  The matching WIDEN restores the margins to
               their former positions.

               Alternatively, you can have:
WIDEN &lt;se&gt; [ ,&lt;e&gt;] &lt;paragraphs and statements&gt; NARROW

               which moves the margins outward.  Both kinds can nest.

               These  commands  change  the   automatically  declared
               variables  LMARG  and   RMARG  (the  Left   and  Right
               Margins).   They  can  also  be  changed  directly  by
               assignment statements; such  changes are local  to the
               current block and to the current NARROW-WIDEN  nest of
               the current PLACE area.

               Upon exit  from a block,  if the margin  positions are
               different than they  were at the beginning,  then they
               are  restored  and  instead of  the  usual  Break, END

               the next line as a vest instead of a crown line.

               This  breaks and  switches output  to the  named area.
               This may be done  many times on the same  page; output
               to each area always picks up where it left off.

               If  a  column  of the  current  Place  Area overflows,
               output continues at the top of the next  column.  When
               the last column overflows, either a new page  is begun
               (if a  TEXT AREA  overflowed) or  an error  message is
               given (if a TITLE AREA overfowed).



6.10 TEMPORARY AREAS
<span>     _________ _____

               This section is complicated.  Only read it if you need
               to create temporary areas within a page.  To  do this,
               you need  to know where  you&#39;re up to  on the  page so
               far.  If there&#39;s not enough room for the new area, you
               will want to go to a new page.  Then a  temporary area
               (local to a block) should be declared, and text placed
               in it.  Finally, you may need to find out where you&#39;re
               up to on  the page again  before you exit  that block,
               skip  over  the  temporary  area,  and  resume regular
               output.

               A more convenient way to handle this may  be available
               in a future version of PUB in the form of a  BOX FRAME
               declaration.  In the  meantime, you should be  able to
               get by as follows.

               To determine the top  line on the whole page  that the
               current PLACE area uses, look at TOPLINE.  Within that
               area, lines  are numbered  starting from  1 --  but if
               TOPLINE is 6 that means &#34;line 1&#34; of the area is really
               the 6&#39;th line on the page.  We can distinguish P-lines
               (numbered  relative to  the whole  page)  from A-lines
               (numbered local to the area); A-line 1 might be P-line
               6.

               To determine  the column number  and A-line  number of
               the last line output in this area, look at  COLUMN and


                             6.9 - 6.10

               LINE.  To determine  how many empty columns  remain in
               this area, look at  COLUMNS; for how many  empty lines
               remain  in  this  column, look  at  LINES.   Note that
               LINE+LINES can  be less  than the  full height  of the
               area,  because  a  few  lines  at  the  bottom  may be
               occupied by footnotes.

               To declare a two-column area 10 lines high for a table
               starting just below the last output line, write:

.IF LINES &lt; 10 THEN NEXT PAGE ;
.BEGIN
.AREA AXE LINES TOPLINE+LINE TO TOPLINE+LINE+9 IN 2 COLUMNS 5 APART
.PLACE AXE
         &lt;table text&gt;
.END
.GROUP SKIP 10
               Adding TOPLINE  in the  AREA declaration  is necessary
               because it expects P-line numbers.



6.11 COUNTER DECLARATION
<span>     _______ ___________
        Syntax:
COUNT &lt;id&gt; [INLINE] [FROM &lt;e&gt;] [TO &lt;e&gt;] [BY &lt;e&gt;] [IN &lt;counter id&gt;]
         [PRINTING &lt;e&gt;|&lt;template&gt;]

               This is  PUB&#39;s excuse for  a FOR statement.   The user
               can declare  certain identifiers  to be  counters, and
<span>                                                        ________
               arrange them  in hierarchies.   A counter  is anything
               you want numbered sequentially.  Typical  counters are
               SECTION,   APPENDIX,   SUBSECTION,   PAGE,   FOOTNOTE,
               EQUATION,  TABLE,  FIGURE,  NOTE,  and  REFERENCE.   A
               common hierarchy is:

                        SECTION
                       /       \
                   SUBSECTION  PAGE
                                |
                             FOOTNOTE

               The declarations for this hierarchy might be:

.COUNT SECTION FROM 1 TO 9
.COUNT SUBSECTION FROM 1 TO 99 IN SECTION
.COUNT PAGE FROM 1 TO 99 IN SECTION
.COUNT FOOTNOTE INLINE FROM 1 TO 9 IN PAGE

                                6.11

               The  &#34;IN&#34;  clause  specifies  the  hierarchial  parent
               counter; it must have been previously declared.

               The range  of each counter  is specified by  the FROM,
               TO, and BY clauses; if omitted, FROM 1, TO 18,  and BY
               1 are assumed.  The  counter need not ever  attain the
               TO-value; it is just an upper limit used  to determine
               the maximum number  of characters needed to  print the
               counter in case it is referred to in a  Forward Cross-
               Reference (see Section 9.1).

               The  INLINE  option   suppresses  a  BREAK   which  is
               otherwise automatically generated before each stepping
               of the counter.

               The PRINTING clause is explained in Section 7.3.

               That means  that their scope  is not limited  by block
               structure.  an  occasional exception  to this  rule is
               the assignment  statement; when the  assigned variable
               is SPREAD, LMARG, RMARG, INDENT1, INDENT2, or INDENT3,
               then the change is local to the current block.

               This breaks (unless INLINE appeared in  the designated
               counter&#39;s  COUNT  declaration),  and  the  counter  is
               stepped  to  its next  value.   The first  time  it is
               called, the counter&#39;s value is initialized.

               Every  COUNT  declaration  automatically  declares two
               variables  with  special  properties,  and initializes
               them to NULL.  The first variable has the same name as
               the &lt;counter id&gt;, e.g., &#34;SUBSECTION&#34;, and its value is
               always the decimal integer value of the  counter.  The
               other variable&#39;s name  is constructed by  appending an
               &#34;!&#34; to the &lt;counter id&gt;, e.g., &#34;SUBSECTION!&#34;.  The two
               variables are called the counting or &#34;C-value&#34; and the
               printing or &#34;P-value&#34;, respectively.

               The precise effect of the statement &#34;NEXT U&#34;  in terms
               of these variables is as follows.

               (1) If U=NULL, then U is set to the FROM value  of the
               COUNT declaration; otherwise, U is incremented  by the
               BY value of the COUNT declaration.

               (2)  The  P-value  is computed  under  control  of the
               PRINTING  clause of  the COUNT  declaration  (just how
               will be explained shortly).  In addition,  the P-value
               is  assigned  to  the  variable  &#34;!&#34;  as  a convenient
               abbreviation.

               (3)  If  the  counter  has  hierarchically subordinate
               counters, all their  C-values and P-values are  set to
               NULL; thus, when you say NEXT SECTION, SECTION becomes
               a  new  number while  SUBSECTION,  PAGE,  and FOOTNOTE
               become  NULL  (assuming the  hierarchy  of  the recent
               example).   Exception:  If  &#34;PAGE&#34;  was  one   of  the
               subordinate  counters,  after  it  is  cleared  it  is
               immediately initialized.

               The computation of the P-value depends on the PRINTING
               clause  of  the COUNT  declaration.   There  are three
               cases.

Case One  The PRINTING clause is omitted.  P-value is the same as the
<span>____ ___
          C-value.

Case Two  PRINTING &lt;template&gt;.  After  each C-value is  computed, the
<span>____ ___
          expression inside the template is evaluated, and the result
          is  the  P-value.   Thus, the  template  should  contain an
          expression which involves the C-value.  Examples:

                                 7.3

<span>.COUNT SUBSECTION IN SECTION PRINTING <span>⊂</span>SECTION! &amp; &#34;.&#34; &amp; SUBSECTION<span>⊃</span> ;</span>
          When SECTION!=4 and SUBSECTION is counted to 7, SUBSECTION!
          becomes 4.7 .

Case ThreePRINTING &lt;e&gt;.   The expression is  evaluated only  once, at
<span>____ _____
          declaration time,  and its  value serves  as a  pattern for
          conversion of the C-value to the P-value.  For example, the
          pattern  &#34;(i)&#34;  will  produce  P-values  such  as  (iv) and
          (xlii), and the pattern &#34;!-A&#34; will produce P-values such as
          6-A and 33-L.  The  pattern should evaluate to a  string of
          the form:
&lt;prefix&gt; [ !  &lt;middle&gt; ] &lt;format&gt; &lt;suffix&gt;
          where &lt;prefix&gt;,  &lt;middle&gt;, and &lt;suffix&gt;  may be  empty, and
          &lt;format&gt;  must  be 1,  a,  A,  i, or  I.   This  is roughly
          equivalent to the template:
<span><span>⊂</span>&lt;prefix&gt;&amp; ! &amp;&lt;middle&gt;&amp; CONVERT(&lt;counter id&gt;,&lt;format&gt;) &amp;&lt;suffix&gt;<span>⊃</span></span>
          Here&#39;s  what  happens.  The  P-value  becomes  this pattern
          after substituting the parent counter&#39;s P-value for &#34;!&#34; (if
          present) and after converting the C-value to  the specified
          format and substituting it for &lt;format&gt;.  Before explaining
          formats, let&#39;s give a simple example:

.COUNT SUBSECTION IN SECTION PRINTING &#34;!.1&#34; ;
          Here, &lt;prefix&gt; and &lt;suffix&gt; are empty and &lt;middle&gt;  is &#34;.&#34;.
          Format &#34;1&#34; is no-conversion, so the C-value  is substituted
          unchanged  for  the   &#34;1&#34;.   The  P-value  of   SECTION  is
          substituted for the &#34;!&#34;.  Say SECTION! is 6  and SUBSECTION
          is stepped to 4; then SUBSECTION! becomes 6.4 .
          The various &lt;format&gt; conversions are:

1         No conversion
<span>I ````````Upper case Roman, i.e., 59 <span>→</span> LIX</span>
i         Lower case Roman
A         Capital letters A,...Z,AA,BB,...ZZ,AAA,...
a         Little letters



7.4 NEXT PAGE STATEMENT
<span>    ____ ____ _________

               This variety of Next Statement has special properties.
               Before  stepping  the PAGE  counter,  it  &#34;closes&#34; and

               outputs all the areas on the current page and  sets up
               a fresh page frame.

               Conversely, when  a page  is closed  due to  text area
               overflow or &#34;SKIP TO COLUMN 1&#34;, etc., the page counter
               is  automatically  stepped  before  the  new  page  is
               opened, as if the command NEXT PAGE had been given.



7.5 HEADINGS AND FOOTINGS
<span>    ________ ___ ________

               As soon as the first  line is ready to be placed  in a
               page, the page is &#34;opened&#34;.  There are fancy  ways you
               can create fancy headings  and footings at that  or at
               other  times (see  Section 10.2).   For  simple cases,
               the following command (which  is actually a call  to a
               built-in macro) is provided.
        Syntax:
.EVEN|ODD|EVERY  HEADING|FOOTING ( &lt;text&gt;, &lt;text&gt;, &lt;text&gt; )

               On left-facing  (EVEN), on  right-facing (ODD),  or on
               all pages  (EVERY); on the  top line (HEADING)  or the
               bottom  line  (FOOTING);  the  three  &lt;text&gt;s  will be
               printed at  the left edge,  the center, and  the right
               edge  of the  page,  respectively.  A  &lt;text&gt;  may not
               contain quote (&#34;).  Example:
.ODD HEADING({DATE}, MACHINES THAT WONDER, {SUBSECTION!})

               This would  cause to  print on the  top line  of every
               right-facing page something like:
July 14, 1789           MACHINES THAT WONDER                  VII.iii



7.6 SECTIONING
<span>    __________

               The correct way  to start every  new section on  a new
               page is:
.NEXT PAGE ; NEXT SECTION ;

               If the  order of  these were  reversed and  if SECTION
               were  the  parent  of PAGE,  then  NEXT  SECTION would
               change PAGE&#39;s  value before the  old page  got written
               out.

7.7 COMMAND CHARACTER STATEMENT
<span>    _______ _________ _________
        Syntax:
COMMAND CHARACTER &lt;qc&gt;|&lt;v&gt; ;

               The  parameter  must evaluate  to  a  single character
               string.   That  character  subsequently   assumes  the
               function of  dot in column  1.  Since this  command is
               not a declaration, its scope is global; i.e, it is not
               affected by block nesting.  Don&#39;t omit the semicolon!



7.8 PORTION DEMARCATION
<span>    _______ ___________
        Syntax:
PORTION &lt;id&gt;

               The  manuscript  may  be (ought  to  be)  divided into
               Portions,   such  as   TITLEPAGE,   CONTENTS,  THESIS,
<span>               ________
               APPENDICES, NOTES, INDEX, and BIBLIOGRAPHY.

               Precede each portion by a Portion Demarcation, e.g.,
.PORTION NOTES

               The compiler will assure that each portion starts on a
               fresh page and ends with a paragraph break.

               In general, the order of appearance of the portions in
               the manuscript  becomes their  order of  appearance in
               the document.  However, this is not always convenient.
               For  example,  the entries  for  PORTION  CONTENTS are
               usually generated during  the processing of  the other
               portions   (see  Section   7.9);   therefore,  PORTION
<span>                                                              _______
               CONTENTS must appear at the end of the manuscript.  To

               show where you would like its output to be inserted in
               the document, use the statement:
.INSERT &lt;id&gt;, ...

               which  is  sort of  a  &#34;forward  portion demarcation&#34;.
               Example:








                              7.7 - 7.8

7.9 SEND STATEMENT
<span>    ____ _________
        Syntax:
SEND &lt;portion id&gt; [;] &lt;template&gt;

               With  every portion  is associated  a file  called its
               generated  file.  A  generated file  is  in manuscript
<span>               _________  ____                             __________
               format.   The  idea  is  that  you  can  avoid  manual
               preparation  of  certain portions  of  your manuscript
               (such  as  the table  of  contents and  the  index) by
               making PUB prepare them mechanically.

               The generated file of  a portion may remain  empty, or
               may be  written on during  the processing  of portions
               that appear earlier  in the manuscript.   For example,
               the generated files  for PORTION CONTENTS  and PORTION
               INDEX are usually  generated during the  processing of
               earlier portions.

               The SEND statement writes  a template onto the  end of
               the generated file for the named portion.  The portion
               must appear later  in the manuscript.   Before sending
               the  template,  the  compiler  substitutes  for  every
               occurrence of:
{ &lt;v&gt; }

               the (unquoted) value of the variable &lt;v&gt;.

               Thus, if S=6 and PAGE=26, then the statement:



                                 7.9

<span>Section {S} -- Findings <span>∞</span>.<span>→</span> {PAGE}</span>

               would send the  following data to the  file associated
               with PORTION CONTENTS (CRLF shown here for clarity):

&lt;CRLF&gt;
<span>Section 6 -- Findings <span>∞</span>.<span>→</span> 26&lt;CRLF&gt;</span>
.

               If a similar SEND  were performed at the  beginning of
               every section and  subsection of the  manuscript, then
               by the time the compiler reached PORTION CONTENTS, its
               generated file would be in perfect  manuscript format,
               e.g.:

<span>Section 1 -- Introduction <span>∞</span>.<span>→</span> 1</span>
.
<span>Section 2 -- Remarks <span>∞</span>.<span>→</span> 6</span>
.
         (etcetera)
<span>Section 6 -- Extraneous Factors <span>∞</span>.<span>→</span> 26</span>
.
         (etcetera)
<span>Section 413 -- Conclusions <span>∞</span>.<span>→</span> 864</span>
.
               The empty command lines are of course  harmless; their
               inclusion was caused by the method of  conforming with
               one of the rules of writing templates: a template must
               end  on  a  command  line.   Of  course,   a  template
               alternatively could end with a text line terminated by
               &#34;{&#34;.

               The subtleties of generated files are discussed in the
               Appendices  to  this  manual.   If  you  would  rather
               postpone becoming an expert on the technique,  you can
               still obtain a table of contents and index by  the use
               of  someone  else&#39;s  macros.   These  macros (STANDARD
               FRONT   and  STANDARD   BACK)  are   stored   in  file
               PUBMAC.DFS[1,3]     and     described      in     file
               PUBMAC.TES[UP,DOC].

7.10 RECEIVE STATEMENT
<span>     _______ _________
        Syntax:
RECEIVE [&lt;qc&gt;|&lt;v&gt;]

               This statement substitutes  the generated file  of the
               current  portion  for  the  statement  and  causes the
               compiler  to  compile  it.   Thus,   PORTION  CONTENTS
               typically consists of  a few mode setting  commands, a
               title, and then the statement &#34;RECEIVE&#34;.

               If  the  optional  parameter  is  present,  it  should
               evaluate to a string of one or two characters, say &#34;L&#34;
               or  &#34;LR&#34;.  The  presence of  the parameter  causes the
               generated  file  to  be  alphabetized  before   it  is
               compiled.  Entries in the file should be in the form:
&lt;0 or more characters&gt; L &lt;Key&gt; [R &lt;0 or more characters&gt;]

               PUB will alphabetize  the entries by the  &lt;Key&gt;s using
               the  ASCII  collating  sequence,  except   lower  case
               letters  and  &#34;_&#34; are  ranked  with  the corresponding
               upper case  letters and  &#34;!&#34;.  Then  it will  read the
               alphabetized file, including the L and R characters.

               WARNING:  The  characters  L  and  R  must  be  chosen
               carefully.  They may  not occur in the  generated file
               in any  role except  as key  delimiters.  Furthermore,
               the characters &#34;[&#34;, &#34;]&#34;,  &#34;@&#34; may not be used.   It is
               legal for L and R to be the same character.

               If  your index  is very  large, PUB  may  exhaust SAIL
               string  space  trying to  alphabetize  it.   The error
               message &#34;STRING  SPACE EXHAUSTED&#34;  will be  typed out.
               Unfortunately, the only  way to get more  string space
               is to  REEenter the program  and go through  the ALLOC
               ritual   (see  SAIL   manual  14-22).    The  original
               allocation is presently 4000 words; try 7000 or 10000.

               To generate a  simple index, use SEND  statements such
               as:

<span>.SEND INDEX ; <span>⊂</span></span>
<span><span>β</span>Keyword <span>∞</span>.<span>→</span> {PAGE}</span>
<span><span>⊃</span> ;</span>
               and the RECEIVE statement:
<span>.RECEIVE &#34;<span>β</span><span>∞</span>&#34;</span>

               The file  generated will  be quite  funny-looking, but
               will result in the document:

               Rather than  all those hideous  dots, it  is suggested
               that  the  number immediately  follow  or  precede the
               word.

7.11 REQUIRE STATEMENT
<span>     _______ _________
        Syntax:
REQUIRE &lt;qc&gt;|&lt;v&gt; SOURCE_FILE

               The  parameter must  evaluate  to a  file  name, e.g.,
               &#34;BRAIN.BAZ[H,AHA]&#34;.   The file  must be  in manuscript
               format.   It  will  be  substituted  for  the  REQUIRE
               statement and compiled.  If the last line of  the file
               is a text  line, PUB will  still be scanning  for text
               when  it resumes  the original  file, so  don&#39;t  put a
               semicolon after the REQUIRE statement -- put a CR.

               REQUIREd files may REQUIRE other files.  You  will run
               out of  channels if the  number of  open SOURCE_FILEs,
               generated files (extension &#34;.PUG&#34;) and pass one output

               SKIP  N  breaks  and  leaves  N  blank  lines  in  the
               document.  If N is  omitted, SKIP 1 is  assumed.  Note
               that N must be a simple expression -- no assignment or
               conditional  expression   is  allowed  unless   it  is
               parenthesized.

               Blank lines that would appear at the top of any column
               are  automatically suppressed;  if you  want  to force
               them to  appear (say, to  leave space for  a drawing),
               use GROUP SKIP.

               If you  are going  to run off  the same  document with
               different  values  of SPREAD  (i.e.,  sometimes single
               space and  sometimes double  space), you  should write
               all your  KIP statements with  this factor  taken into
               account, e.g., SKIP 2*SPREAD-1 .

               SKIP  TO LINE  N  outputs blank  lines up  to  but not
               including the N&#39;th line (A-line) in the current column
               of output text, unless the N&#39;th line has  already been
               passed, in which case it goes to the N&#39;th line  in the
               next column.  The most common use of this statement is
               SKIP TO LINE 1, which assures you are at the top  of a
               clean column.

               SKIP TO COLUMN N outputs blank lines until  it reaches
               the top of the N&#39;th  column of this or the  next page.
               If  the compiler  is already  at the  top of  the N&#39;th
               column, this statement does nothing.  The  most common
               use is  SKIP TO  COLUMN 1,  which goes  to a  new page
               unless a new  page has just been  begun.  (To go  to a
               new page  regardless, use &#34;NEXT  PAGE&#34; --  See Section
               7.3).

               prose.   After  the quotation,  a  paragraph  break is
               necessary to terminate it.
                    Unfortunately,  the  break  also  causes the
                    next output  line to be  treated as  a crown
                    line (in  FILL mode).   If you  would rather
                    continue  the  interrupted   paragraph  than
                    start a new one, use the command CONTINUE.
               It breaks,  but causes the  next paragraph to  have no
               crown, as long as no regular breaks intervene.

               This statement is equivalent to setting the /L, /M, or
               /T switch when starting  up PUB.  It has no  effect on
               Pass  One output.   However,  Pass Two  reacts  to the
               switch setting as follows.

               DEVICE MIC makes the document file be in FR-80 command
               format.  Pass Two will output two temporary files with
               extension  &#34;.RPG&#34;  and  automatically  run  a  program
               called  &#34;TXTF80&#34;,   written  by  Russ   Taylor,  which
               generates the document file.  Simply copy this file to
               a tape and bring it to the FR-80 operator at Lockheed.

               DEVICE  LPT and  DEVICE TTY  produce  identical output
               unless the  page frame  is higher  than 53  lines.  In
               that case, DEVICE LPT uses strange  control characters
               instead  of  line  feeds  to   inhibit  page-ejection.
               DEVICE TTY assures that only line feeds are issued.

               Files  produced under  DEVICE TTY  can be  edited with
               TECO.  Hardly any document file can be edited with SOS
               or TVEDIT,  which don&#39;t like  CR&#39;s without  LF&#39;s (used
               for underlining and superimposing).



7.17 UNIMPLEMENTED STATEMENTS
<span>     _____________ __________

               The following commands have not been  implemented, but
               ought to be, so their names are reserved words:

CASE statement -- SAIL-style
ALIGN statement -- it would align output to side-by-side areas
PACK statement -- it would align the bottoms of parallel columns
BOX FRAME STATEMENT -- to insert a table in a corner of the page
LOCK statement -- to protect lines from being moved by a BOX FRAME
SHOW statement -- to output to the console during compilation
NOPRINT mode -- would suppress output
PRINT mode -- would renew output

               LDX output will soon be available.  This  will require
               a   few  new   commands  and   automatically  declared
               variables, probably the following:

                              COMMENTS


               There are two ways to get comments into a command line
               -- not  in the  middle of  an identifier  or constant,
               however.
        Syntax:
COMMENT anything but semicolon ;

               This one is probably familiar.  The other one is:
&lt;&lt;  anything but two greater-than-signs in a row  &gt;&gt;

               Comments may  extend over  several command  lines.  If
               you leave out  the terminator, you&#39;ll  lose everything
               up to the next text line.

               Comments have  no effect on  the document.   Why would
               you want them?  Maybe you could write English comments
               on  a  French manuscript  to  help you  find  your way
               around.  Or maybe  you&#39;ve got complicated  macros that
               need explanation.  Or you left out a bunch of text and
               want to leave a reminder in the manuscript.  Don&#39;t ask
               me why -- I just implemented them.

               To get a comment into a text line, use  curly brackets
               around   a  regular   comment  {&lt;&lt;   Like   this  &gt;&gt;}.
               Continuation lines must be command lines.

                              SECTION 9

                     LABELS AND CROSS-REFERENCES




9.1 CROSS-REFERENCES
<span>    ________________

               A  cross-reference is  like computed  text in  that it
               causes characters to be processed by the text scanner,
               and in that it normally appears between curly brackets
               in the midst of a  text line.  First there will  be an
               example, and then an explanation.
... invented by Owsley (See {&#34;Page!&#34; PURE}) ...

               This might produce output such as:
... invented by Owsley (See Page 3-7) ...

               The  identifier PURE  is called  a label  and  must be
<span>                                                  _____
               defined once and  only once in the  manuscript, either
               before or after the cross-reference.  Every  label has
               a  value,  much  like a  variable,  but  the  value is
               assigned only once, at the place the label is defined.
               Several cross-reference  statements may  reference the
               same  label.   Labels  willbe  explained   further  in
               Section 9.2.

               There  is  a   major  problem  in   handling  forward-
               references  in a  text-justifier.  The  justifier must
               know how  many characters there  will be in  the value
               before it  can decide  where to  break off  the output
               line   and   how   many   spaces   to   insert  during
               justification.   PUB   solves  this  problem   by  two
               slightly  awkward hacks.   One hack  is that  you must
               state  or  imply  an  upper  limit  on  the  number of
               characters, so it can leave enough room for it and not
               break off the line  too soon.  The other hack  is that
               PUB has  two passes.  In  the second pass,  the actual
               values  are  substituted,  and  only  then  are  lines
               justified.

               To &#34;state or imply&#34; the upper limit, you have a choice
               of three forms of cross-reference.

Form 1:  [ &lt;e&gt; ] &lt;label id&gt;

               Those are  really square  brackets!!!!  Write  them in
               the manuscript, really!  The expression evaluates to a
               number which is the maximum number of  characters, and
               the value  printed is  the value  of the  label &lt;label
               id&gt;.  If this is  a backward reference (unless  to the
               current page), the number  is ignored, so you  can say
               just: {[] &lt;label id&gt;}.   You can&#39;t just say  the label
               name.

Form 2:  &lt;counter id&gt;[!] &lt;label id&gt;
               Those  square brackets  mean  the &#34;!&#34;  is  optional --
               don&#39;t write them  in the manuscript!  This  form means
               that the value  of the label  will be the  C-value (if
               there is no  &#34;!&#34;) or P-value (if  there is an  &#34;!&#34;) of
               the counter &lt;counter  id&gt;.  PUB can compute  the upper
               limit at declaration time by looking at the  TO clause
               of the counter&#39;s COUNT declaration and at the PRINTING
               clause, so you  don&#39;t have to  state it.  In  case the
               PRINTING clause  used a template,  the upper  limit is
               determined  by   a  not  quite   foolproof  heuristic:
               suitably large numbers are substituted temporarily for
               the C-value  of the  counter, for  both values  of its
               parent, and for !, and the expression is evaluated.

Form 3:  &#34;&lt;counter id&gt;[!]&#34; &lt;label id&gt;
               This is identical to form 2, except before sending the
               value of the label  to the text scanner, it  sends the
               string  (without  the  &#34;!&#34;) and  a  space.   Thus, the
               following are exactly equivalent:

... See Section {Section! X} ...
... See {&#34;Section!&#34; X} ...

               The  macro used  for cross-references  in  this manual
               was:
<span>.MACRO YON(LBL) <span>⊂</span> &#34;Section &#34; ; SUBSECTION! LBL <span>⊃</span></span>

               which was called like this:
...lots of useless words (See {yon someplace}). Lots more ......

&lt;label definition&gt; ::=  &lt;label id&gt; :  &lt;label definer&gt;
&lt;label definer&gt; ::=  [NEXT] &lt;counter id&gt;[!]   |  &lt;e&gt;  |  &lt;text line&gt;

               Here is an example of each kind of &lt;label definer&gt;:

.INTRO: NEXT SECTION

.LAPLACE: IF ODD PAGE THEN PAGE ELSE PAGE+1

.EXPLANATION:
This is the line that is labelled by the label &#34;EXPLANATION&#34;.

               The first kind of definer makes the value of the label
               be the current C-value (if there is no &#34;!&#34;) or P-value
               (if there is an &#34;!&#34;) of the named counter.  If NEXT is
               present, the counter is stepped before  the assignment
               is made.  The second kind makes the value of the label
               be the value of the expression.  The third  kind makes
               it be the value of  PAGE! for the page that  the &lt;text
               line&gt; begins on.

               The  first and  third kinds  of definer  both  cause a
               consistency  check between  all  forward-references to
               this label that mention a counter name and the counter
               named  here.   The  second  kind  does  not   cause  a
               consistency check.  CAUTION:  There is  no consistency
               check on backward-references.  There is no  check when
               a  cross-reference  specifies a  P-value  (or C-value)
               that the label definition also specifies a P-value (or
               C-value).  So  if the output  is incorrect,  check for
               such inconsistencies yourself.

               A label must  always be on  a command line,  or inside
               curly brackets on a  text line.  If the /D  switch was
               used to obtain  debugging information, then  the label
               will be printed on the right side of the document.

               There is  a slight  ambiguity if  your &lt;label definer&gt;
               involves PAGE  (or PAGE!).   If you  use the  first or
               third  kind  of definer,  the  evaluation  is deferred
               until the  next text line  is output, i.e.,  until the
               next paragraph break  or overflowed FILL  line.  Thus,
               you  may  think  of  a  PAGE  label  as  labelling the
               following  text  line; even  if  a new  page  is begun
               before that  line is output,  the label value  will be
               the page  on which  that line  appears.  On  the other
               hand, if you use the second kind of definer  (i.e., an

               will be the current  one at the time of  evaluation --
               even  if the  following text  line doesn&#39;t  get output
               until the next page.

               Note that L:NEXT PAGE will  go to a new page  and then
               assign L a value when the first line is output to that
               page.   If  the  page  is  blank,  the  assignment  is
               deferred another page.  All this kludgery is to insure
               that if you say:  See {&#34;Page&#34; X} there will  really be
               something to see!  Be sure to position the  label just
               before the text line you want them to see.

10.1 TEXT RESPONSES
<span>     ____ _________

               A  Text  Response   enables  you  to   detect  certain
               conditions  in  the  text,  and  to   call  macro-like
               subroutines  without  using  {...}.   Presently,  four
               conditions can be responded to:

(1) Page Mark or Form Feed
(2) Blank Text Line
(3) Indented Text Line
(4) Presence of a one-to-five character signal

        Syntax:
AT &lt;condition&gt; [;] &lt;template&gt;

               When the condition is detected, the characters causing
               it are replaced by:
{ &lt;template&gt; }

               which is immediately executed.

               To dis-declare a response  exit the block in  which it
               was declared, or use a null template:
<span>AT &lt;condition&gt; [;] <span>⊂</span><span>⊃</span></span>

               The various &lt;condition&gt;s available are as follows:

               AT PAGEMARK  responds to  an SOS page  mark or  a TECO
<span>               __ ________
               &lt;CR LF FF&gt;.  A typical use is:
<span>.AT PAGEMARK <span>⊂</span>SKIP TO COLUMN 1<span>⊃</span></span>

               AT NULL  responds to  a blank text  line.  There  is a
<span>               __ ____
               predeclared response for this:
<span>.AT NULL <span>⊂</span>IF FILLING THEN BREAK ELSE SKIP 1<span>⊃</span></span>

               This is the only reason that blank lines break in FILL
               mode.  You can  redeclare it to treat  them otherwise.
               If you want them ignored, write:
<span>.AT NULL <span>⊂</span>IF NOT FILLING THEN SKIP 1<span>⊃</span></span>

               uninterrupted in  a text  line.  This  one &lt;condition&gt;
               can be followed  by a formal  parameter list of  up to
               five arguments, e.g.:
<span>.AT &#34;%%&#34; A &#34;$&#34; B &#34;%&#34; C &#34;$&#34; ``<span>⊂</span> SEND INDEX <span>⊂</span> }A B-C{BREAK <span>⊃</span> <span>⊃</span></span>

               Each parameter name is followed by a string containing
               a  single character  called its  delimiter.   When the
<span>                                                _________
               signal (in the example, %%) is spotted in a text line,
               the compiler continues to scan for  actual parameters,
               terminating  each scan  at the  appropriate delimiter.
               An actual parameter  may span several text  lines, but
               each carriage-return is  converted to a space  if this
               happens.   No  parameters may  be  omitted.   None are
               evaluated -- they are all literal.



10.2 TRANSITION RESPONSES
<span>     __________ _________

               A transition response permits the specification  of an
               action  to be  taken at  the beginning  or end  of any
               counter or at the opening or closing of any area.
        Syntax:
BEFORE|AFTER &lt;counter id&gt;|&lt;area id&gt; [;] &lt;template&gt;

               Here is how this response fits into the NEXT &lt;counter&gt;
               algorithm.  To execute NEXT SECTION, PUB  performs six
               steps:

<span>1) If SECTION<span>≠</span> NULL then do AFTER SECTION response (if any)</span>
2) Step SECTION using FROM and BY values
3) Compute SECTION! using PRINTING clause, and assign it to !
4) Do BEFORE SECTION response (if any)
5) For each sub-counter of SECTION, and each of their sub-counters:
<span>`````````a) If C-value<span>≠</span> NULL: AFTER sub-counter response (if any)</span>
         b) Clear sub-counter C-value and P-value to NULL
         c) If it is PAGE, initialize PAGE and PAGE!
6) Re-assign SECTION! to ! (steps 4 and 5 may have changed it)

               The END of the block in which any counter  is declared
               (except PAGE) also causes Step 1 to occur.

               The most useful  transition responses are  BEFORE PAGE
               and AFTER PAGE.  The BEFORE PAGE template  is executed
               not  immediately after  NEXT PAGE  is executed,  but a
               little later, when the  first line of output  is ready
               to be put on the new page.  BEFORE &lt;area id&gt; responses
               are similarly deferred until the first output is ready
               for  the  named  area.   The  AFTER  PAGE  template is
               executed just before the page is written out -- it had
               better  not place  into a  text area  that  is already
               full!

               One transition response is pre-declared for you:
<span>BEFORE PAGE <span>⊂</span> STANDARD TITLES <span>⊃</span></span>

               STANDARD TITLES  is a  pre-declared macro  that prints
               the headings and footings set up by EVERY  HEADING and
               its  friends.   You  can  of  course   redeclare  this
               response.

               Every transition response template is  automatically a
               block.  It is surrounded by BEGIN !?@3 ... END !?@3 or
               something of  that sort  (which you  will occasionally
               spot in error  messages).  It is usually  necessary to
               declare all the mode settings and formats you  want to
               be in force inside the &lt;template&gt;.  Consider  the case
               of BEFORE PAGE.   At the time  that a page  happens to
               overflow, it is entirely possible that the compiler is
               in the midst  of a FILL  block with INDENT  10,20, all
               control characters off, and the NOFILL PREFACE  set to
               2.   However,  the  headings  and  footings  should be
               processed   in  NOFILL   mode  with   preface   0,  no
               indentation, and several control characters activated.
               You might declare:

<span>.BEFORE PAGE <span>⊂</span> NOFILL ; INDENT 0``; PREFACE 0 ; TURN ON &#34;{<span>←</span><span>→</span>&#34;</span>
.PLACE HEADING
<span>{DATE}<span>←</span>AUTOMATIC VETERINARIAN<span>→</span>{SECTION!}</span>

<span><span>←</span>{SUBTITLE!}</span>
.PLACE FOOTING
<span>{IF ODD PAGE THEN &#34;<span>→</span>&#34;}{PAGE!}</span>
<span><span>⊃</span></span>

<span>                                                                 ____
               and  the  foot.   During  preparation  of   the  calf,
<span>                         ____
               paragraphs  can  be sent  to  the foot.   A  column is
               considered full when the sum of the lines in  the calf
               and the foot exceeds the height of the area.

               You can not declare Portion FOOT nor do a  RECEIVE for
               it.  The  compiler automatically  declares a  FOOT for
               each area you declare, and does a RECEIVE for it after
               each line is placed  in the calf.  Your  only foothold
               is the command &#34;SEND FOOT&#34;.

               Example:

.COUNT FOOTNOTE INLINE IN PAGE PRINTING &#34;(i)&#34;
<span>.AT &#34;$$&#34; ENTRY &#34;*&#34; <span>⊂</span> NEXT FOOTNOTE ; ! ;</span>
<span>.SEND FOOT <span>⊂</span> TURN ON &#34;{&#34; PREFACE 1 SPREAD<span>←</span>1 INDENT 0,0</span>
{!} ENTRY
<span>.BREAK <span>⊃</span> <span>⊃</span></span>

                         *
               An example  of the use of the &#34;$$&#34; signal response is:

...have been shown $$Abelwitz has obtained
similar results in his experiments with
hippopotami.*.
               which will print in the calf:
...have been shown (iv).

               and in the foot:

(iv) Abelwitz has obtained similar results
in his  experiments with hippopotami.

               There  is  an implicit  BEGIN  FILL ;  ...  END around
               footnotes.

                             APPENDIX A

                    THOROUGHLY EXPLAINED EXAMPLES




A.1 SECTIONING MACROS
<span>    __________ ______
               At the beginning of  each section, it is  customary to
               perform the following ritual:

&lt;&lt;1&gt;&gt; Begin a fresh page
&lt;&lt;2&gt;&gt; Count up the section number
&lt;&lt;3&gt;&gt; Print the section number and name
&lt;&lt;4&gt;&gt; Skip a few lines
&lt;&lt;5&gt;&gt; Send the section number, name, and page number to the CONTENTS

               See the document PUBMAC.TES[UP,DOC] for  a description
               of the macros STANDARD FRONT and STANDARD  BACK, which
               do all these  things for you.   If you want  to define
               your own macros, read on.

               A  macro  to  perform  all  the  steps   listed  above
               &lt;&lt;commented for reference&gt;&gt; is:

.MACRO SEC(NAME)
.&lt;&lt;1&gt;&gt; NEXT PAGE
.&lt;&lt;2&gt;&gt; NEXT SECTION
.&lt;&lt;3&gt;&gt; ONCE CENTER
<span><span>↓</span>_SECTION {!}_<span>↓</span> -- <span>↓</span>_NAME_<span>↓</span></span>
.&lt;&lt;4&gt;&gt; SKIP 3
<span>.&lt;&lt;5&gt;&gt; SEND CONTENTS <span>⊂</span></span>
<span>{!}\\NAME<span>→</span>{PAGE!}{<span>⊃</span><span>⊃</span></span>

               A sample call on this macro is:
.SEC SPECIAL FEATURES

               At the beginning  of each subsection, a  similar macro
               can be  called.  The one  below prints  the subsection
               name on  a line  by itself  but prints  the subsection
               number at the beginning of the first line of the first
               paragraph of the subsection.  It makes sure that there
               are enough  lines for  all this  to be  contiguous; if
               not, it first goes to a new page.  Finally,  it allows
               the macro call to specify a label to be used in cross-
               references to this subsection.

A.3 ONE-LEVEL INDEXES
<span>    _________ _______
               There is  presently no  way to  have a  phrase indexed
               automatically every time it occurs.  PUB  now requires
               that  you  mark each  phrase  to be  indexed  at every
               occurrence  that you  wish to  be referenced.   The AT
               &lt;signal  characters&gt; response  is  particularly useful
               for this purpose.

               Choose a character or  a pair of characters  that will
               never  appear  in  the text  of  your  manuscript; for
               example &#34;%&lt;&#34;.  This will be your signal that  the next
               phrase is to be indexed.  Then choose a character that
               will never appear in such a phrase; for  example, &#34;&gt;&#34;.
               This  will be  your end-of-phrase  delimiter.  Suppose
               you  would like  the phrase  &#34;Simple variables&#34;  to be
               indexed.  Find each occurrence of this phrase  in your
               manuscript and surround it by your chosen characters:

Nothing warms the heart like %&lt;simple variables&gt;.  We

               Your favorite text editor may be of some help  in this
               task; however, watch out  for a phrase that  is broken
               across two  lines:  the  editor will  miss it  if your
               search string is too stringent.

               Suppose you  would like your  index to  look something
               like this:

signed constants  8.0
significant digits  10.3, 10.7
signs  2.4, 3.7
simple variables  8.1, 20.8, 20.11

               Now you need to declare a signal response (see Section
               10.1) at the beginning of your manuscript:

<span>.AT &#34;%&lt;&#34; PHRASE &#34;&gt;&#34; <span>⊂</span> }PHRASE{</span>
<span>.SEND INDEX <span>⊂</span> }<span>∧</span>&lt;PHRASE&gt;{PAGE!}<span>∨</span>{<span>⊃</span><span>⊃</span></span>

               This will  respond to each  occurrence in the  text of
               the  signal  &#34;%&lt;&#34;.  The  characters  that  follow this
               signal, up to but not including the next &#34;&gt;&#34;,  will be
               substituted  in the  body  of the  template  for every
               occurrence of the word  PHRASE.  Then the body  of the
               template will be surrounded by &#34;{...}&#34; and embedded in
               the text, replacing all characters from  and including
               &#34;%&lt;&#34; to and including &#34;&gt;&#34;.  The effect in  the example
               above would be:

Nothing warms the heart like {}simple variables{}
<span>.SEND INDEX <span>⊂</span> }<span>∧</span>&lt;simple variables&gt;{PAGE!}<span>∨</span>{<span>⊃</span>. We</span>

               SEND causes the current PAGE! to be substituted in the
               SEND  template.   Thus,  the  characters  sent  to the
               generated file will be:

<span>`}<span>∧</span>&lt;simple variables&gt;2.6<span>∨</span>{</span>

               In the generated  file, each index entry  is signalled
<span>```````````````by``the character``pair &#34;<span>∧</span>&lt;,``followed by``the phrase,</span>
<span>```````````````followed by &#34;&gt;&#34;, followed by the page number``and &#34;<span>∨</span>&#34;.</span>
               You may  of course choose  your own  delimiters.  They
               will be  recognized by  the following  signal response
               that appears in PORTION INDEX:

.RECEIVE &#34;&lt;&gt;&#34; ; COMMENT ALPHABETIZE BEFORE READING ;

               RECEIVE will alphabetize the entries.  The &#34;AT&#34; signal
               response will analyze each entry and make a  couple of
               checks before outputting it:

               (1) If the phrase is the same as the one just printed,
               it simply appends the page number of the new  entry to
               the   last  line   printed.   For   example,   if  the
               alphabetized file contained:
<span>...<span>∧</span>&lt;Signs&gt;2.4<span>∨</span>{}<span>∧</span>&lt;Signs&gt;3.7<span>∨</span>...</span>

               then the index would include:
Signs  2.4, 3.7

               (2) Else, if the first letter of this and the previous
               phrase are the same,  it goes to the next  line; else,
               it skips a line.  Thus, between the A&#39;s (and  a&#39;s) and
               the B&#39;s (and b&#39;s)  there will be a blank  line.  Then,
               it prints both the phrase and the page number.



A.4 TWO-LEVEL INDEXES
<span>    _________ _______
               A  &#34;two-level  index&#34; divides  some  phrases  into two
               parts: a &#34;generic&#34; part and a &#34;specific&#34; part, e.g.:

compilers,
        Algol  13, 15
        Fortran  18
        LISP  22
        SAIL  15
computers,
        analog  29
        digital  10, 64, 80
consoles  16, 25

               In the  phrase &#34;Fortran  compilers&#34;, &#34;Fortran&#34;  is the
               specific part and &#34;compilers&#34; is the generic part.

               This time  we will  approach the  problem analytically
               instead  of  synthetically.  There  are  two  kinds of
               entries: one part and  two part   If two  entries have
               the same  generic part  (e.g., &#34;computers&#34;),  then the
               generic part should print only once.

               As PORTION INDEX receives each entry, it  must compare
               it  with the  preceding entry.   Say that  the generic
               part of the preceding entry was WASL and  the specific
               part was WASR (WASL  was thus printed on the  Left and
               WASR on the Right).   The generic part of  the current
               entry is L and the specific part is R.  If WASL  and L
               are  different, a  whole new  generic entry  is  to be
               printed.  Otherwise,  if WASR and  R are  different, a
               new specific entry is to be printed.  Otherwise, a new
               page number is to be added to the last entry printed.

               As an extra feature  in this index, we will  not print
               the same  page number  twice on  the same  line, i.e.,
               twice in a  row.  Thus, an additional  variable, WASP,
               will  be  needed  to  remember  the  page  number last
               printed.

               Furthermore, if  the entry has  no specific  part (see
               &#34;consoles&#34;  in the  above example),  the  page numbers
               will be printed on the same line as the generic part.

               The  PORTION  INDEX  that  follows  assumes  that  the
               generated file has entries of the form:

&#34;&lt;&#34; generic-part &#34;/&#34; specific-part &#34;&gt;&#34; page-number &#34;%&#34;

               where the specific-part can be empty.

               To  create  the  generated  file  for   PORTION  INDEX
