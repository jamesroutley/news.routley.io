<p>Nearly half of San Franciscans have been a victim of theft in the past five years and a quarter have been threatened or physically attacked, according to a new poll.</p>
<p>Findings from the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/sfnext-poll-decline-17436506.php">SF Chronicle survey</a> underscored the challenges of the city and the unhappiness of its residents, with 65% saying life in SF is <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/sfnext-poll-decline-17436506.php">worse today</a> than when they moved here.  </p>
<p>The survey also found that 39% of residents have had their property damaged in the past five years.</p>

<p>The new poll of residents confirms the findings of <a href="https://sfstandard.com/politics/san-francisco-standard-voter-poll-june-2022/">The Standard’s poll of voters</a> prior to the June 2022 election. By far, both studies found that the No. 1 reported problem in the city is homelessness, followed by crime/safety.</p>

<p>San Franciscans also feel that racism complicates the city’s ability to solve the problems it faces. Importantly, 73% of Black residents and 70% of Asian residents say racism plays a role in the city’s ability to deal with local issues, while 56% of white residents say so. Overall, only 12% of residents say that racism does not make solving problems more difficult.</p>
