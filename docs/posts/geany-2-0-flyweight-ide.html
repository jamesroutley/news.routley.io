			<h2>Fast &amp; Small</h2>
			<p>One the primary reasons for Geany&#39;s existence is that there
			is a need for a decent, GUI, lightweight, cross-platform, flexible
			and powerful IDE/editor. Many editors meet one or more of these
			requirements but fall short on others.
			</p>
			<p>Geany attempts to hit the sweet spot.</p>
