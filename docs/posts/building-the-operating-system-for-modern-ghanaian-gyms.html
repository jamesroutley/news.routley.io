    <h3 id="the-why">The Why</h3><p>As a product-minded software engineer, I am constantly on the lookout for real problems to solve in the environments I frequent. Fitness, like software, is a core part of my routine, which means I spend a significant amount of my time in gyms. This dual perspective has helped identify several operational gaps in local gym workflows.</p>
<h3 id="the-problems">The Problems</h3><p>Through direct observation and conversations with gym owners, several core issues became clear:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Non-local software dependency. Many gyms rely on foreign software solutions, paying hundreds of dollars to companies outside the country to build, maintain, and host their systems and their data. These tools are often disconnected from local realities and operational needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Poor support experience. After interviewing a couple of gym owners, it became clear that getting timely and effective support for non-local platforms is often slow, difficult, or expensive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Low member engagement and high churn. In a lot of gyms, there is no strong system in place to keep members engaged over time, making churn pretty much inevitable</p>
</li>
<li><p>Invasive biometric requirements. Some platforms require gyms to collect biometric data such as fingerprints for access and attendance. I do not believe my gym, or some external software provider, should have access to something this sensitive. In 2025, smoother and less invasive identification methods should be the norm.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Outdated platforms. Many existing solutions feel dated and lack modern user experiences.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Operational inefficiencies. I have observed slow and manual processes that negatively affect owners, staff, instructors, and members alike.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reimagining-gym-operations">Reimagining Gym Operations</h3><p>With <a href="https://fitsynq.app" target="_blank">FitSynQ</a>, my goal is to streamline gym workflows, reduce operational friction, and improve member experience in order to reduce churn.</p>
<p>I intend to do this by simplifying and connecting every one of the gym&#39;s core processes. This includes member registration, attendance and session tracking, class discovery and booking, marketing and member engagement, purchases and payment management.</p>
<p>To make this vision tangible, I have architected the platform as a four-part system, with each component serving a specific purpose in the gym ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="the-platform-architecture">The Platform Architecture</h3><p>The platform consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A robust, multi-tenant, role-based backend built with NestJS and Supabase</p>
</li>
<li><p>A Progressive Web App for gym members</p>
</li>
<li><p>An admin panel for gym staff and owners</p>
</li>
<li><p>A kiosk application designed specifically for registration and check-ins</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each component is designed to work together seamlessly, while remaining simple and focused on its primary purpose.</p>
<h4 id="the-member-experience">The Member Experience</h4><p>The member application is the entry point into the gym’s digital experience. Members access it directly through their mobile browser, without the friction of app store downloads. Upon registering, they fill in their profile information and gain access to a personalized dashboard.</p>
<p>The app becomes the home for everything related to their gym journey, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Subscriptions and membership status</p>
</li>
<li><p>Attendance history and activity analytics</p>
</li>
<li><p>Payment tracking and receipts</p>
</li>
<li><p>Direct communication with the gym</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It gives members clarity, ownership, and visibility into their fitness experience.</p>
<h4 id="seamless-check-ins-with-the-kiosk-app">Seamless Check-Ins with the Kiosk App</h4><p>The kiosk application is built to make registration and check-ins as seamless as possible. Every member receives a unique QR token after registering. This serves as their personal digital key to the gym.</p>
<p>On arrival, members scan their QR code at the front desk to mark the start of their session. During the session, front desk staff can make updates such as adding in-session purchases. After the session, members scan their QR code again to record their exit.</p>
<p>If they checked-in for a one-time session, or if unpaid purchases exist, the member is prompted, both on the kiosk and in the member app, to make payment to complete check-out. Payments can be made directly in the member app via card or mobile money, keeping the entire flow smooth and uninterrupted.</p>
<h4 id="empowering-staff-through-the-admin-panel">Empowering Staff Through the Admin Panel</h4><p>The admin panel is built to simplify and accelerate staff workflows. It presents real-time gym data through clean, intuitive dashboards and allows staff to take action based on their roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Front desk staff manage daily operations such as sessions, complaints, in-session purchases, subscriptions, and renewals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Instructors manage class schedules, bookings, and attendance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Owners access reporting and analytics that provide clear insights into business performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The focus is speed, clarity, and control, without overwhelming the user.</p>
<h3 id="the-goal">The Goal</h3><p>The ultimate goal of this platform is to make gym operations easier for everyone involved:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Gym owners can manage multiple locations from a single admin panel and gain meaningful insights into performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gym staff can handle day-to-day tasks efficiently and confidently.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Instructors can create, manage, and promote their classes with ease.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Members enjoy a smoother, more engaging gym experience through simpler registration, faster check-ins, easier payments, and better activity tracking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My dream is to onboard as many local gyms as possible and make this platform the default operating system for gyms across the country. The vision extends beyond these initial applications. I intend to continue building products for the wider fitness community and invest in tools that improve how people train, operate, and connect around fitness.</p>
