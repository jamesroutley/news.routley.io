    <h1>Custom for designing, off-the-shelf for shipping</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As software engineers, we&#39;re paid to <del>write really cool type annotations</del> solve problems.
Usually we do this by taking a bunch of different pieces and putting them together to solve the problem.
Maybe you mix together a database, a queue, a web framework, and some business logic.
Or maybe you design a new storage engine, your own web framework, and a custom cache.
It&#39;s an engineering question to determine which way is the right way.
Should you build custom things? Or should you use off-the-shelf existing pieces?</p>
<p>There is no general answer for that, of course.
It&#39;s dependent on your situation.
But there is a pattern that I&#39;ve found helpful for problem-solving which balances the two approaches.
You use as many custom components as you like for designing a solution, and then you use (mostly) off-the-shelf components for what you&#39;re going to <em>ship</em>.</p>

<p>This technique helps a lot when you aren&#39;t sure what the solution will look like.
If you try to design a solution using off-the-shelf solutions here, you may run into a couple of problems.
First is that it&#39;s just a weird solution space, and you have to move in pre-defined step sizes.
Second, though, is that you might <em>need</em> a custom component.
If you need <em>just one</em>, when you&#39;re designing with off-the-shelf components, how will you realize that?
And how will you know <em>where</em> that one custom component should go?
Besides, how do you even know that <em>any</em> solution is possible?</p>
<p>Designing with custom components allows you to get an existence proof that the problem is solvable.
You don&#39;t need to worry about a good solution, one that&#39;s viable.
You first need to worry about <em>any</em> solution, as complicated as you like.
If you can put together all these custom things you know you could build, then you know that some path exists!</p>
<p>Custom components are also really helpful when a part exists but you don&#39;t <em>know</em> it exists.
You have a problem, you know that it would help you to have something that can solve it.
If you haven&#39;t solved that problem before, how would you know that a solution does exist?
You look at it with custom components, and then that can lead you toward discovering the existing components.</p>

<p>After you&#39;ve designed a solution, you move on to refining the solution.
It&#39;s ideal if you can build something entirely using off-the-shelf components, because those exist!
You don&#39;t have to reinvent them, and it&#39;s probably cheaper to use them.</p>
<p>You can look at each of your custom components and start to ask: why is this custom?
Maybe it needs to be, but more often, what it&#39;s solving is similar to something someone else has solved.
You can look for those related tools and related problems, and find those solutions.
Then slide a solution in in place of your component!</p>
<p>Occasionally, you <em>will</em> find something where an off-the-shelf component does <em>not</em> exist which is equivalent to your custom one.
Then you start to ask, okay, did I solve this problem wrong?
I begin at the assumption that I&#39;m <em>not</em> in a totally unique problem space.
Then I look at how other people solved this problem, or why they <em>didn&#39;t have to</em>.
What is it that people are doing that&#39;s different here so they don&#39;t run into it?</p>
<p>And then if you get through that, you may actually have a unique new problem!
And you get to keep that custom component in your design.
But along the way, you moved a <em>lot</em> of custom work into using off-the-shelf components.</p>
<p>Take a break, give yourself a pat on the back, then <del>get back to work making money for corporate overlords at the cost of your health</del> have fun building!</p>

<p>Despite doing most of my problem solving in software, the example I want to share is a physical one (which inspired this post).
I recently rebuilt <a href="https://stategraph.dev/blog/evolving-ergo-setup/">my ergonomic setup</a> again, my fifth iteration.
This time, it is made of mostly off-the-shelf parts with one custom part.</p>
<p>The first version was very much an existence proof that <em>a way</em> existed to use my laptop &#34;portably&#34; with my ergonomic keyboard.
It wasn&#39;t great, and it didn&#39;t solve portability really, but it gestured at the solutions.
My second version was the real existence proof, and it went almost fully custom.
Off-the-shelf I used a tripod z tilt head, and I made the tray and laptop holder myself (I&#39;m not counting the keyboard or laptop, since I&#39;m building a solution around them).
My third version used <em>only</em> custom components, and showed me it&#39;s possible!
The fourth version used more custom components in a different arrangement.</p>
<p>And now my new version?
It&#39;s mostly off-the-shelf components.
I didn&#39;t know most of these existed at all when I started on the rig a couple of years ago.
Instead of a tray with grooves in it for my keyboard to slide on them, or velcro to hold it down, I got camera equipment!
It uses two camera rods, two mounting blocks for those, two z-mount tripod heads, a &#34;magic arm&#34;, and a tripod laptop holder tray.
And a small custom component: a little wood piece that keeps it balanced, essentially outriggers.</p>

<p><img src="https://stategraph.dev/processed_images/ergo-rig.16d2b2a35905fd4e.jpg"/></p><p>It&#39;s probably not done, though.
There will surely be a sixth iteration.
If nothing else, I want to replace the laptop holder.
This one is a little too heavy; the rig as a whole is serviceable, but it would be nice to make it a little lighter for travel.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>So go forth and build things.
Feel free to use as many custom components as you want when designing, but then think about if you can do it with off-the-shelf components when you want to be able to ship it.
Of course, if my boss is reading this, reverse all the advice.
You <em>know</em> I need to build us a new database in Rust.
C&#39;mon.</p>
