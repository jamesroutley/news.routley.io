    <h1>The Drenching Richness of Andrei Tarkovsky</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>While Tarkovsky was pondering his next project, he saw Stanley Kubrick’s “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/23/2001-a-space-odyssey-what-it-means-and-how-it-was-made">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>,” which he both disliked and envied. He set about making “Solaris” (1972), his own attempt at transcendental science fiction. The source was <a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Solaris-Stanislaw-Lem/dp/0156027607" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Solaris-Stanislaw-Lem/dp/0156027607&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Solaris-Stanislaw-Lem/dp/0156027607" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the eponymous novel</a> by the Polish sci-fi writer Stanisław Lem, in which a sentient ocean planet invades the consciousness of human visitors and drives them mad. Unlike Kubrick, Tarkovsky showed little interest in the mechanics of space travel, dwelling instead on the haunted memories and unresolved conflicts of his protagonist. (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/steven-soderbergh">Steven Soderbergh</a>’s 2002 remake, also titled “Solaris,” is more faithful to Lem’s text.) Hallmarks of the later Tarkovsky come to the fore, for better or for worse: majestic long takes, rambling philosophical dialogues, extended scrutiny of classic art works, bouts of Bach on the soundtrack. The lead actor, Donatas Banionis, is all too palpably trying to figure out what kind of movie he is in.</p><p>Tarkovsky was probably right when he named “Solaris” his weakest film, but it is transfixing all the same. As Julia Shpinitskaya points out in “ReFocus,” Tarkovsky almost emulates Kubrick in a nearly five-minute-long sequence that consists largely of highways and tunnels as seen from a moving car. A thick overlay of electronic sound, fashioned by the composer Eduard Artemyev, helps transform the footage into a voyage no less mind-bending than the one at the climax of “2001.” By the end of “Solaris,” Banionis seems to have returned to a country house on Earth, but increasingly lofty vantage points reveal that he is on an island in the seething Solaris ocean. Bach’s chorale prelude “Ich ruf zu dir” gives way to a cataract of noise.</p><p>“My aim is to place cinema among the other art forms,” Tarkovsky wrote in his diaries. “To put it on a par with music, poetry, prose, etc.” He fulfilled that ambition spectacularly in “Mirror,” which came after “Solaris.” A deeply personal work that re-creates scenes from Tarkovsky’s childhood in fanatical detail, “Mirror” is at the same time a tour-de-force assemblage of stream-of-consciousness memories, dreamscapes, paranormal occurrences, poetry recitations, and grainy newsreel footage. Watching it is like attending a séance of the twentieth-century Russian soul. The first time I saw “Mirror,” I experienced it as a gorgeous, sensuous bewilderment. It was equally rewarding to watch the restored film in conjunction with Johnson and Petrie’s fastidious analysis. “Mirror,” like “Ulysses” or “The Waste Land,” is the kind of work for which you welcome a guide.</p><p>The cinematographer for “Mirror” was Georgy Rerberg, who had a knack for making drab interiors and dusky landscapes shimmer with unseen forces. From the start, irrational events ensue: a barn bursts into flame, a jug crashes to the floor, ghostly presences materialize, people levitate. Heightening the uncanny atmosphere, the actor Margarita Terekhova plays two distinct characters: one based on Maria Tarkovskaya, Tarkovsky’s mother, and the other based on Irma Raush, his first wife. Tarkovskaya is also cast as herself, in scenes set in the present day. At the end, Tarkovsky creates chronological pandemonium by having his mother share the frame with a representation of her much younger self. The situation is ripe for psychoanalysis, which the filmmaker and historian Evgeny Tsymbal, once Tarkovsky’s assistant, supplies in “ReFocus.” One has the sense that Tarkovsky held his mother partially responsible for his father’s departure, and that this feeling perhaps became a source of his warped attitudes toward women. But the film transcends the director’s misogyny on the strength of Terekhova’s expressively harried performance. She holds fast against the tide of male neurosis rising around her.</p><p>“Stalker,” Tarkovsky’s final Russian film, has become his most celebrated work, almost a pop-culture phenomenon. It has inspired a brilliant free-associative study by Geoff Dyer—“<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Zona-Book-About-Film-Journey/dp/0307390314" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Zona-Book-About-Film-Journey/dp/0307390314&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Zona-Book-About-Film-Journey/dp/0307390314" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Zona</a>,” from 2012—as well as a series of first-person-shooter video games. In Tallinn, Estonia, where much of the film was shot, you can take a Tarkovsky-themed bike tour. The cult of “Stalker” is surprising, because, at first encounter, it is the most cryptic of Tarkovsky’s hieroglyphs. Based on Arkady and Boris Strugatsky’s sci-fi novel “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Roadside-Picnic-Rediscovered-Classics-Strugatsky/dp/1613743416" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Roadside-Picnic-Rediscovered-Classics-Strugatsky/dp/1613743416&#34;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Roadside-Picnic-Rediscovered-Classics-Strugatsky/dp/1613743416" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Roadside Picnic</a>,” it contrasts an ashen outer world with an eerily verdant place known as the Zone, which appears to have been visited by aliens. Inside the Zone is the Room, where all wishes are said to come true. Although military guards shoot at anyone who tries to enter the Zone, guides known as “stalkers” lead illegal tours. The film follows three men named Stalker, Professor, and Writer, who are played with laconic grit by Alexander Kaidanovsky, Nikolai Grinko, and the hypnotic, hooded-eyed Solonitsyn. Their inching progress across booby-trapped, supernatural terrain unfolds like a slow-motion, hyper-abstract thriller—a zombie apocalypse without zombies.</p><p>Nothing in Tarkovsky’s work has elicited more awestruck comment than the sequence in which the travellers pass into the Zone. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/28/the-fearless-cinema-of-claire-denis">Claire Denis</a>, in conversation with the director Rian Johnson, <a data-offer-url="https://a24films.com/notes/2019/04/rian-johnson-claire-denis" data-event-click="{&#34;element&#34;:&#34;ExternalLink&#34;,&#34;outgoingURL&#34;:&#34;https://a24films.com/notes/2019/04/rian-johnson-claire-denis&#34;}" href="https://a24films.com/notes/2019/04/rian-johnson-claire-denis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">said</a> of this moment, “I remember I thought I was going to faint. My heart stopped beating for a second.” The first part of the movie, which shows Stalker leaving home and meeting his clients, is shot in desiccated sepia tones. The trio makes it past the guards and travels toward the Zone on railroad tracks, riding a motorized flatcar. A numbing series of shots of irregular length—forty seconds, ninety-six seconds, seven seconds, seventeen seconds, sixty-two seconds—fixate on the sides and backs of the men’s heads, giving only vague glimpses of the surrounding terrain. The clanking of wheels is at first percussively harsh and then fades into an electronic blur. In an abrupt cut, color replaces sepia, and we find ourselves in a landscape of dark-green vegetation, skewed telephone poles, and abandoned vehicles—a leap into a post-human paradise. The flatcar glides to a halt as the men gaze, rapt. It is, Tarkovsky scholars point out, a bleak homage to “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/the-wizard-of-oz">The Wizard of Oz</a>.” As with the censer shot in “Rublev,” the sudden absence of motion generates a kind of internal vertigo, accentuated by an onrush of silence.</p><p>Pontara, in his absorbing study of Tarkovsky’s use of music and sound, shows how much of the spell of “Stalker” depends on its extraordinary audio track. Artemyev, who specialized in electronic composition before collaborating with Tarkovsky, devises a seething soundscape in which otherworldly ditties alternate with upwellings of noise. Tarkovsky throws in some classical selections, but they are alienated from their usual ennobling role. When, in the scenes set in Stalker’s home, trains rumble past, railway sounds intermingle with faintly audible strains of “La Marseillaise,” Wagner’s “Tannhäuser” overture, and Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. Landmarks of Western music are reduced to technological detritus. Pontara suggests plausibly that Tarkovsky is exposing the catastrophic failure of industrial and cultural progress alike.</p><p>The final scenes bring tremors of hope. Although the travellers return from their journey without having dared to enter the Room, alterations in the film stock imply that they have smuggled out some essence of the Zone: a touch of color seeps into the sepia wasteland. In a shiver-inducing epilogue, we learn that Stalker’s disabled young daughter, Monkey, has developed occult gifts. Just before the aural train wreck of Beethoven’s Ninth, she telekinetically pushes a glass off a table. Pontara points out the ideological problem underlying this concluding wonder: in place of failed Romantic aesthetics, Tarkovsky substitutes his own heroic gesture of transcendence. “Stalker” ends up reaffirming, in Pontara’s words, “the false promise that we can escape from and step outside of history and civilization.”</p><p>By the time “Stalker” was released, in 1979, Tarkovsky had become the most internationally celebrated of Soviet filmmakers, but he still faced bureaucratic interference at home. Constraints on his artistic freedom angered him; so did the persecution of Parajanov, a favorite colleague, on anti-gay grounds. (Johnson and Petrie say that Tarkovsky himself was not exclusively straight.) He took up residence in Italy in 1982 and announced his exile two years later. Anticipating this decision, the regime had refused to allow his son Andrei to leave the country. Within two years, perestroika had changed the Soviet cultural atmosphere, but it came too late for Tarkovsky. In 1986, as he was dying of cancer, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/mikhail-gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbache</a>v intervened to allow the younger Andrei to go see his father. The French writer and filmmaker Chris Marker was on hand to witness the reunion; heartbreaking footage of a frail Tarkovsky embracing his son appears in Marker’s 1999 documentary, “One Day in the Life of Andrei Arsenevich.”</p><p>Tarkovsky completed two feature films during his years abroad: “Nostalghia,” made in Italy in 1982 and 1983, and “The Sacrifice,” shot in Sweden in 1985. He enjoyed more creative freedom, but financing was a challenge, and he had lost the network of collaborators who enabled his middle-period masterpieces. Some critics hail these final works as a supreme revolt against cinematic convention; others detect symptoms of mannerism and decline. Both films bewitched me when I first saw them, but I’m now inclined to agree with Dyer, who comments that, after “Stalker,” Tarkovsky fell into self-imitation: “The guru became his own most devoted disciple.”</p><p>The long takes grow liturgical in manner. At the end of “Nostalghia,” the protagonist, a Russian travelling in Italy, spends nine minutes attempting to carry a lit candle across the length of an empty mineral pool, believing that he will thus avert the end of the world. He then falls dead, and there follows an awesome vision of a Russian dacha nestled within a medieval Italian abbey. “The Sacrifice” stages a similar ritual of world redemption: a Swedish intellectual becomes convinced that if he sleeps with a local witch he will undo an apparent nuclear war. His bargain also involves the burning of his island home—a six-minute take that consummates Tarkovsky’s motif of immolation.</p><p>These images are as grandly dumbfounding as any that have been put on film, yet the surrounding narratives are thin. The Swedish actor Erland Josephson, a mainstay of Bergman’s troupe, appears in both “Nostalghia” and “The Sacrifice,” and invests his divine-madman roles with emotional conviction. But other actors struggle—especially the women. Domiziana Giordano, in “Nostalghia,” and Susan Fleetwood, in “The Sacrifice,” are obliged to enact prolonged scenes of female hysteria. A dark aspect of Tarkovsky’s critique of industrial modernity manifests itself: the reversion to a pre-modern order brings with it a reinforcement of male dominance. In the Zone of “Stalker,” women disappear entirely, leaving only three men and a dog.</p><p>Such regressive tendencies have left Tarkovsky open to appropriation by the pseudo-religious illiberal ideology that has asserted itself in Putin’s Russia. The director has attained a canonical position in his homeland; there is a statue of him outside V.G.I.K. and a monument in Suzdal. As Sergey Toymentsev notes, latter-day Russian critics have linked Tarkovsky to Eastern Orthodox theology. Toymentsev counters that, although Tarkovsky was fascinated by religious iconography, he described himself as an agnostic. “The one thing that might save us is a new heresy that could topple all the ideological institutions of our wretched, barbaric world,” he once declared. Nor did he espouse conventional nationalist views. In his diaries, he wrote, “Pushkin is superior to the rest because he did not give Russia an absolute meaning.”</p></div></div></div></div>
