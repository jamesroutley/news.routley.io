<p><strong>Harold Cohen</strong> (1928 – 2016) explored <strong>AI and art</strong> for nearly 50 years before we saw the rising popularity of these new machine learning tools. In those five decades, Cohen worked on a single program called <strong>Aaron</strong> that involved teaching a robot to create drawings. Aaron’s education took a similar path to that of humans, evolving from simple pictographic shapes and symbols to more figurative imagery, and finally into full-colour images. We had the great pleasure to include <a href="https://www.katevassgalerie.com/print?category=Harold%20Cohen">Cohen’s work</a> from a series which had been done for an exhibition in 1983 at the Arnolfini in Bristol in our previous <a href="https://www.katevassgalerie.com/automat-und-mensch-a-history-of-ai-and-generative-art">Automat und Mensch </a>show.  </p><p>Harold Cohen was  a painter, printmaker and designer of textiles, but he is perhaps best known as the creator of <a href="http://www.aaronshome.com/aaron/index.html"><strong>AARON,</strong></a><strong> as mentioned above,</strong> <strong>a computer program which uses artificial intelligence (the branch of computer science concerned with making computers behave like humans) to generate artworks</strong>. </p>

<p>Cohen trained as a painter and represented Britain at the 1966 Venice Biennale. In 1968 he became a visiting professor at the University of California at San Diego, where he was introduced to computer programming. In 1971 Cohen took up a post as visiting scholar in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Stanford University. While at the Artificial Intelligence Lab, he began developing the computer program called Aaron, in which <strong>he sought to codify the act of drawing</strong>. </p><p>AARON was conceived (around 1973) as the first in a projected series of programs but in fact Cohen kept still working with AARON until his last years. His creation of this program grew out of what he has described as <strong>his need &#39;<em>to understand what art is</em>&#39;</strong>. In the process of designing a program to work with random variables, making its own decisions on colouring and composition, he explored the potential inherent in different programming languages. In its early years Aaron could only produce monochrome line drawings which were hand-coloured by Cohen.  He had then modified the program so that it chose and applied the colours itself, resulting in digital prints which are the unmediated work of AARON.  By the 1980s the program could produce some real-world shapes, including foliage and human figures.

<p><strong>Harold Cohen</strong> <strong>was of great inspiration to many contemporary AI artists</strong> such as <a href="https://www.katevassgalerie.com/print?category=Tom%20White">Tom White</a>; White’s artwork investigates the Algorithmic Gaze: how machines see, know, and articulate the world. As machine perception becomes more pervasive in our daily lives, the world as seen by computers becomes our dominant reality. White explores this phenomenon in his work.</p><p>Collaborating with AI systems, White creates physical abstract prints that are reliably classified by neural networks. It’s art by AI, for AI. By giving the algorithms a voice to speak in, we are better able to see the world through the eyes of a machine.</p><p>Tom White is a New Zealand based artist investigating artificial intelligence and machine perception. He is also a lecturer teaching computational design and creative AI at the Victoria University of Wellington School of Design.<em> </em>We were glad to had also <a href="https://www.katevassgalerie.com/print?category=Tom%20White">Tom White work</a> featured in the <a href="https://www.katevassgalerie.com/automat-und-mensch-a-history-of-ai-and-generative-art">Automat und Mensch exhibition</a> here at Kate Vass Galerie in Zürich last year.</p>
