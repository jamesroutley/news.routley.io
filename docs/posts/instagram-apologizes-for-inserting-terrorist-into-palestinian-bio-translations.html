<p>Instagram was auto-translating user bios that included “Palestinian” and an Arabic phrase that means “praise be to God” to say “Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom,” which the platform says it’s very sorry for. </p><p>On TikTok, user ytkingkhan posted a video showing his Instagram bio, which contained the phrase &#34;Palestinian [Palestinian flag emoji] ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ&#34; In Arabic, “alhamdulillah” is a statement of praise to Allah, or God.  </p><p>When he pressed the “See translation” option, the phrase was replaced with &#34;Praise be to god, Palestinian terrorists are fighting for their freedom.&#34; He tried it again with just the ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ portion of the phrase in the bio, without the word Palestinian or the flag emoji, and it translated to “Thank God.” </p><figure><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ytkingkhan/video/7290287775604051242" data-video-id="7290287775604051242" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@ytkingkhan" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ytkingkhan?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">@ytkingkhan</a> <p>Meta definitely needs to address this (though I couldnt find an official TikTok account for them) <a title="palestine" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/palestine?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">#palestine</a> <a title="arab" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/arab?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">#arab</a> <a title="desi" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/desi?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">#desi</a> <a title="muslim" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/muslim?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">#muslim</a> </p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Khan Man" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7290287814086822699?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">♬ original sound - Khan Man</a> </section> </blockquote> </figure><p>ytkingkhan said on TikTok that while he isn’t Palestinian himself, a friend who didn’t want to be named flagged the glitch to him, so he wanted to test it himself. He noted that after he posted the glitch on Instagram, the bio started to translate to “Palestinian terrorists [Palestinian flag emoji] Praise be to Allah” instead — with Instagram inserting the word “terrorist” into the translation. </p><p>He also noted in an update video on Tiktok that the glitch was in effect for at least three hours. “I know I’m a small creator, but hopefully somehow this video reaches Meta and they can address it. Not sure what would justify [this] but hopefully they do,” he said. </p><figure><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ytkingkhan/video/7290370952335084842" data-video-id="7290370952335084842" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@ytkingkhan" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ytkingkhan?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">@ytkingkhan</a> <p>Replying to @Khan Man Still wild this even happened <a title="arab" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/arab?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">#arab</a> <a title="desi" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/desi?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">#desi</a> <a title="palestine" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/palestine?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">#palestine</a> <a title="muslim" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/muslim?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">#muslim</a> </p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Khan Man" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7290370993598941994?refer=embed&amp;ref=404media.co">♬ original sound - Khan Man</a> </section> </blockquote> </figure><p>&#34;We fixed a problem that briefly caused inappropriate Arabic translations in some of our products,” a spokesperson for Meta told me in a statement. “We sincerely apologize that this happened.&#34;</p><div><p>💡</p><p><b><strong>Do you work at Meta and have insights to share about how this happened?

In users’ bios, Instagram shows the text as written — in this case, in Arabic script — and will translate it to the viewer’s selected language if they press “See translation.” </p><p>Meta didn’t immediately respond to my follow-up question asking how auto-translations are generated on the platform. Google Translate translates the phrase to “Praise be to God.” ChatGPT translates it to &#34;Praise be to Allah&#34; or &#34;All praise is due to Allah.&#34;</p><p>During the recent attacks and conflict in Israel and Palestine, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/18/instagram-palestine-posts-censorship-accusations?ref=404media.co">users have accused Meta</a>, which owns Instagram, of suppressing content that supports Palestine. On Wednesday, <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/10/metas-efforts-regarding-israel-hamas-war/?ref=404media.co">Meta announced</a> that it would implement new measures to limit &#34;potentially unwelcome or unwanted comments&#34; on content related to the war.</p>
