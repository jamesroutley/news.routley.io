<p><span><span>It’s a cold spring morning</span> and I’m watching a tour guide in the Old Town of Tallinn.</span> <span>With her back to a park built on a city block destroyed in World War 2 and facing a set of mediæval buildings not far from the old town square, head in a warm beanie, she’s explaining Estonia to a group of cruise ship tourists.</span> </p><p><span>‘Over fifty percent of Estonia is covered in trees,’ she says.</span>  ‘<span>Estonians have a great connection to nature.</span> <span>We feel it spiritually, and it’s common for us to visit the countryside or go for a walk in a forest or bog.</span> <span>We have one of the most forested countries in Europe and it’s very precious to us.’</span> </p><p><span>I don’t interrupt to tell the tourists what’s really going on.</span> </p><p><span><span>◆     ◆     ◆</span> </span></p><p><span>The village of Lehetu lies about fifty kilometres south of Tallinn, a few kilometres off the highway.</span> <span>Dating back to 1241,<span><span></span> <span><span>There’s a stone in the village green saying: ‘Lehetu Küla taani hindamisraamat 1241’, referring to the village’s record in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Census_Book "><span>Danish Census Book</span></a>.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span>  it’s mostly known for the <span>Saida farm, whose cheese can be found in supermarkets all over the country.</span> <span>Driving in, there’s a long road with forest on both sides, then you turn a corner and the village opens up.</span> <span>There is a car parts warehouse, oddly out of place, but then apartment buildings and a beautiful green common with a large oak and a lake in the middle.</span> <span>On the other side are picturesque wooden houses before the road changes to gravel and heads off into a mix of farms and forest.</span> <span>It’s a deeply forested area.</span> <span>The dairy farm plus a few grain or canola fields are the only nearby industry, and cycling down the roads leading out of the village will take you to an abandoned wooden farmhouse where, in spring, a vast field of wild garlic grows under spruce trees.</span> <span>You can take another road through deep green forest to a spot where trees are covered in moss like they come from the Lord of the Rings, and if you continue cycling you will arrive at a small stream, brown with peat tannins, a pair of beavers living just upstream.</span> </span></span></p><p><span>The Estonians who live in this area have a Facebook group where they share photos of wildlife⁠.</span> <span><span></span> <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1150448955032516 "><span>Nissi Loodusfoto</span></a>.</span> </span><span> <span></span> </span> <span>Trail cameras capture stags, wild boar, and the shy lynx.</span> <span>Sometimes, those who walk the road to the stream come across wolf prints, and once that of a bear.</span> </p><p><span>This is the forest the tour guide is proud of.</span> <span>And it’s all being cut down.</span> </p></section><section><h2 id="estonian-connection-to-nature">Estonian Connection to Nature</h2>
<p><span><span>The tour guide in Tallinn was right:</span> Estonians do feel a deep connection to nature.</span> <span>Many Estonians moved to urban areas only within one or two generations, and so many have family connections to the land.</span> <span>Many Estonian families have a ‘country house’, the wooden farmhouse their ancestors lived in, now shared among the children or grandchildren and visited often in summer.</span> </p><p><span>Deep in the Estonian forest are the old places of spiritual connection, sacred boulders and sacred trees, both of which were central to Estonian religion before Christianity was brought to the country.</span> <span>Estonia was one of the last Christianised in the world, and it’s commonly reported as an atheist country.</span> <span>Instead many Estonians term themselves as spiritual, looking for connections with nature: maausklikud, ‘earth-believers’.</span> <span>Often centuries old, the land’s sacred trees are visited as a kind of pilgrimage.</span> </p><p><span>In Lahemaa, the country’s most famous national park, I visited one sacred tree in summer 2020.</span> <span>Lying just off a small road, and with multiple tree-trunks grown as the one tree spread over time, it was covered in ribbons carefully tied to the branches.</span> </p><figure>

</figure>
<p><span>But the connection to nature Estonians feel lies not only in ancestral spiritual tradition.</span> <span>Ignoring religion completely, Estonians visit nature regularly.</span> <span>When coronavirus hit, so many Estonians went hiking to get away from people that the forestry commission recorded overcrowded trails,<span><span></span> <span><a href="https://news.err.ee/1066503/rmk-calls-on-people-to-avoid-crowded-hiking-trails "><span>RMK calls on people to avoid crowded hiking trails</span></a>.</span> </span><span> <span></span> </span>  so crowded that that one article warned  hikers to keep a safe distance to reduce risk of virus transmission – outdoors!</span> <span>Many Estonians visit the forests during the warm months to pick mushrooms or berries, and the good spots for harvesting wild produce are often kept secret, handed down between family members or close friends.</span> </p><p><span>In 2019 I was taken to one of these local spots, a forest near Lehetu.</span> <span>Built on land deep with peat, a kind of biomass key to carbon capture, birch and pine trees sheltered undergrowth solid with wild blueberry bushes and, for one week a year, the flowering of rare orchids.</span> <span>An hour with a blueberry picker—a kind of fork-like scoop designed to help harvest blueberries—resulted in a huge bucket of the berries and fingers stained a deep crimson from the juice.</span> </p><p><span>By 2020, the forest, with its birch, pine, orchids, and berries, was gone.</span> </p><figcaption role="complementary">First image: the author picking blueberries in the woods near Lehetu (Aug 6 2020.)

<p><span>This isn’t the only forest around Lehetu to vanish.</span> <span>The final curve leading to the village had a field on one side, but thick trees on another: they are gone.</span> <span>The forest deep with moss, one of the most beautiful spots I have seen in Estonian wilderness, vanished just within the past month.</span> <span>Even in winter, in a week when temperatures hit minus seventeen degrees Celsius, the sound of logging machines could be clearly heard on the weekend from Lehetu apartment windows, and I walked down to the road and took photos of piles of logs stacked in the snow.</span> </p><figcaption role="complementary">First image: the most beautiful Estonian forest I’ve seen, full of moss and lichens, near Lehetu (Jan 26 2020.)

<p><span>There are no more blueberries, mushrooms, or gently growing ancient mossy trunks near the village.</span> <span>Each one of the secret groves has been cut down to the bare soil.</span> </p></section><section><h2 id="biodiversity-and-modernity">Biodiversity and Modernity</h2>
<p><span><span>It’s rare for countries in Europe</span> to have so much forest.</span> <span>Countries further south, like Germany, have intensively used the land for centuries and retain only rare areas of old forest.</span> <span>Estonia is unique in the amount of land still covered in trees.</span> <span>The Netherlands, a densely populated country, has just 17% of its land covered in trees; even Germany, larger and with more opportunity for preserving forest, has only a third of its area<span><span></span> <span><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Land_cover_statistics#Land_cover_in_the_EU_Member_States "><span>EU land cover statistics</span></a>.</span> </span><span> <span></span> </span>  covered in either woodland or shrubland (ie, this percentage includes areas you would not view as forest.)</span> <span>Estonia has almost 60% of its land covered in forest or shrubland, with half being the amount popularly viewed as genuine forest, and this is reflected in its clean air (the WHO reports it as one of the top five countries with cleanest air<span><span></span> <span><a href="https://estonianworld.com/life/estonia-has-one-of-the-cleanest-airs-in-the-world-who/ "><span>Estonia’s air is one of the cleanest in the world</span></a>.</span> </span><span> <span></span> </span>  in the world) and variety of wild creatures (almost the entire country is regarded as viable for bears, for example, with the animals once memorably even venturing into a suburb of the capital city.</span> <span><span></span> <span><a href="https://estonianworld.com/life/estonian-police-bears-wandering-around-in-tallinn/ "><span>Bears wandering in Tallinn</span></a>.</span> </span><span> <span></span> </span> )</p><p><span>With such diversity of creatures and unspoiled nature, it’s easy to view what makes Estonia unique as something it can afford to lose.</span> <span>Germany, one might argue, gets along just fine with most of its forest cut, with far fewer species, and with some cities’ air quality regularly rated ‘poor’.</span> <span><span></span> <span><span>See the <a href="https://airindex.eea.europa.eu/Map/AQI/Viewer/ "><span>EU air index</span></a> and examine the <span>Cologne or Dusseldorf stations.</span> <span>They are often very bad.</span> <span>Citation is from when the article was written, January and February 2022.</span> </span> <span></span> </span> <span>Opponents believe that this is not a goal that patriotically values or preserves the country’s unique elements, nor one that aligns with reducing carbon footprint and trying to address the climate problems or human impact we see today.</span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>The view of forest not as something to preserve, but as something to cut down and destroy, fits with the Estonian cultural climate.</span> <span>In many areas, Estonia is having conversations today that other countries had several decades ago: witness <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mitte.tallinn ">this popular <span>Facebook group</span></a><span><span></span> <span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/mitte.tallinn "><span>Mitte Tallinn</span></a> is an enormously popular anonymously authored page, also on <span>Instagram, posting about urban misdesign in Tallinn.</span> <span>It’s worth subscribing to even if you don’t live in Estonia, just to read their well-thought criticisms in the face of some truly bad governmental practice.</span> <span>The author posts regularly, and their dedication is admirable.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span>  protesting the <span>Tallinn city council’s planning infrastructure, which prioritises cars over public transport, pedestrian paths, or good cycling infrastructure; or protesting the urban environment that is continually built using visually unpleasant elements, even with Finland, a closely culturally related country only eighty kilometres way, providing an example of councils working towards urban beauty.</span> </span></span></p><p><span>In these links, it is Estonians who push for modernism, not foreigners.</span> <span>And for all of us, native born or coming here and realising what a wonderful country it is, activism for making Estonia better or to retain what makes Estonia unique is built upon love of the country, on wanting it to be the best it can be.</span> </p><p><span>The attitude to forestry in the Estonian government is similar to the Tallinn city council’s attitude to the city.</span> <span>In the same way Tallinn’s apparently pro-car policies might seem to someone from outside Estonia a very eighties view, the growth of logging and lack of preservation of wild land is a battle that has been fought for many decades in other spaces.</span> <span>The green movement, now a familiar scope for activism in many countries, has its worldwide birth in Australia as recently as just the seventies.</span> <span><span></span> <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement_in_Australia#The_rise_of_the_green_movement "><span>Green movement in Australia</span></a>.</span> </span><span> <span></span> </span> <span>Tasmania, the Australian state that hosted the birth of the green movement, and the place I was born, has some of the last remnants of Gondwanaland forest in the world.</span> <span><span></span> <span><span>ABC: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210728182937/https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/scienceshow/examples-of-australia%E2%80%99s-ancient-forests-not-far-from-hobart/7258370 "><span>Examples of Australia’s ancient forests not far from Hobart</span></a>.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span> <span>I grew up seeing extraordinary rainforest destroyed, hearing of trees that took several hundred years to mature cut for furniture, and seeing the growth of a population protesting the actions of a government made of the previous generation, one which viewed forest as something to use, not to preserve.</span> </span></p><p><span>In Tasmania, fifty years of protests to preserve nature have become part of everyday thought.</span> <span>Bob Brown, one of the leaders of the Green movement and a family doctor, started his career spending time in prison for protests;

<p><span>In 2020, entering some public forests were banned due to the danger of fire in a hot summer—the first time ever in a country saturated with water.</span> <span>Estonia faces more dangers to its nature than just logging.</span> </p><p><span>On December 8, the Estonian Forestry Development Plan 2021-2030 agreed on felling 10 million cubic metres of forest per year.</span>

as meadow.</span> <span><span></span> <span><span>See this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/eestimetsaabiks/permalink/1447027459030478/ ">post with photos and commentary</a></span> <span></span> </span> <span>Logging it, therefore, was not a violation of the law, and the machines cutting down the trees were simply mowing.</span> </span><span></span></p><p><span>In August, land belonging to the city of Tartu was cut down without permission.</span> <span><span></span> <span><span>See <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/eestimetsaabiks/permalink/1433077620425462/ "><span>Mati Sepp’s post on the incident</span></a>.</span> </span> <span></span> </span><span> <span>Citizens nearby repeatedly brought the logging to the attention of the Environmental Board.</span> <span>The Board, eventually investigating, found that land was cut, but according to the Board the diameter of the trees cut were not able to be determined, and therefore the damage could not be ascertained.</span> <span>In fact, the Board was even unable to measure the depth of the marks left… simply because they contained water.</span> <span>Anecdotally, this kind of response is typical.</span> </span></p><p><span>In July, both ERR and Postimees<span><span></span> <span><a href="https://www.err.ee/1608283413/postimees-eestit-ahvardab-kaitsealuse-metsa-raiumise-eest-suur-trahv "><span>Postimees: Eestit ähvardab kaitsealuse metsa raiumise eest suur trahv</span></a>.</span> </span><span> <span></span> </span>  reported on the <span>Ministry of the Environment and the State Forest Management Center ‘misleading’ the public.</span> <span>The European Commission initiated court proceedings against Estonia for logging forest in protected areas.</span> <span>Fifteen thousand hectares of protected forest have been destroyed in the past twenty years.</span> <span>But this court case will take years, perhaps decades, to resolve in terms of forcing government action.</span> </span></p><p><span>That fifteen thousand hectares of government-approved cutting is in supposedly protected natural areas.</span> <span>Unprotected land can effectively be cut at will.</span> </p><p><span>More than that, according to a Postimees article earlier this year, this same forest that is being destroyed and sold is done so via ‘secret schemes’ and underpayment: the timber companies profiting from destroying the forest have private contracts with the State Forest Management Center (RMK) that have different terms than public arrangements would give and provide them further millions of euros of benefit.</span> <span><span></span> <span><a href="https://www.postimees.ee/7448681/salajane-skeem-kuidas-rmk-kestvuslepingutest-miljoneid-eurosid-lisakasu-loigata "><span>Salajane skeem, kuidas RMK kestvuslepingutest miljoneid eurosid lisakasu lõigata</span></a>.</span> </span><span> <span></span> </span> </p><p><span>The pattern of having the same government body responsible for preservation and exploitation, of ‘secret schemes’ and questionable contracts, of changing laws to allow cutting protected land, to slowly investigate issues, to fail to be able to determine damage, and of staff leaving after industry pressure, points to a poison deep in the Estonian government.</span> </p><blockquote>
<span>Our natural environment… is unique in Europe.</span> <span>This is a resource we are not yet conscious of, that we more often than not still have to learn to use [and] we could make huge and incorrigible mistakes when looking for immediate profit.</span>
<span>Let us be masters in our own country, not avaricious colonists, who leave a ravaged country behind them….</span> <span>The export of raw timber is a sign of a bad master.</span> <span>If we add the wasted felling areas and damaged ecosystem, we can see that there is not much left of our advantages.</span>

<p><span><span>Lehetu is a village I’ve spent</span> a lot of time.</span> <span>Surrounded by fields and forest, with deer, foxes and hares visible on any walk, the dug-dirt signs of boar when wandering among the trees, and even the footprints of wolves and bears seen by a few lucky residents, it is representative of Estonia outside the cities most of us see.</span> </p><p><span>There are still trees between the fields.</span> <span>You can drive through and see forest there, mixed with clear-felled plots of land.</span> <span>Yet every one of the forest places I valued, those places of berries, moss, and beauty, is now gone—and it happened fast, in less than a year.</span> <span>Each one will take decades to regrow.</span> </p><p><span>In Estonian, ‘Lehetu’ translates to ‘without leaves’.</span> <span>I used to find this a funny name: completely inappropriate to the reality of a village where it was a pleasure to walk in nature.</span> <span>But today, in the country where tour guides boast to believing tourists of their forest, the village without leaves is now truly becoming leafless.</span> </p></section></article>
