They can&#39;t afford to take back even more of it.&#34;</p><ul data-layout="list-hierarchical-xs"></ul><ul data-layout="list-hierarchical-xs"></ul><div><p>Returned products are handled in a number of different ways, he said. Retailers take back merchandise from the customer, evaluate it, and if it&#39;s in good condition put it back on the shelf at the same or lesser price. </p><p>They can refurbish damaged returns and sell them for less or offload them to liquidators to resell. They also can sell returned products to foreign liquidators for sale in Europe, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/americas/canada" target="_blank">Canada</a> or <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/americas/mexico" target="_blank">Mexico</a>. </p><p>&#34;Given the situation at the ports and the container shortages, sending product overseas isn&#39;t really an option,&#34; said Flickinger.  Lastly, retailers can hire third party firms to handle all aspect of merchandise returns for them.</p><p>Each of these options, however, tack on additional costs for retailers, he said. </p><p>&#34;For every dollar in sales, a retailer&#39;s net profit is between a cent to five cents. With returns, for every dollar in returned merchandise, it costs a retailer between 15 cents to 30 cents to handle it,&#34; said Flickinger.</p><p>There is one other option for retailers to address returns while avoiding more product bloat and that&#39;s to consider a &#39;returnless return,&#39; said Steve Rop, chief operating officer with goTRG, a firm that processes over 100 million returned items annually for companies like Wal-Mart, Amazon and Lowe&#39;s.</p><p data-paragraph-id="paragraph_0C8D5DCD-B664-1F4B-B1EC-91D6A5926366"><h3>Just keep it</h3></p><p>Rop said his company&#39;s clients are 100% considering offering the &#34;keep it&#34; option for returns this year, although he wouldn&#39;t disclose if any of his customers have implemented the &#34;Keep it&#34; returns policy yet. </p><p>In some instances, when they determine it would be easier, some retailers advise customers to just keep or donate their return after issuing a refund. Walmart said it had nothing to share at this time. Lowe&#39;s didn&#39;t provide a comment for the story.</p><p>&#34;They&#39;re already discounting in stores to clear out products but, when there&#39;s heavy discounting, buyer&#39;s remorse goes up. People are tempted to buy a lot to only return it later,&#34; he said.</p><div><div><div><p><img alt="The goTRG&amp;#39;s facility in Bentonville, Arkansas stores a variety of returned general merchandise and consumer electronics." data-src-mini="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220622144241-01-retail-returns-overstocked-gotrg-small-169.jpg" data-src-xsmall="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220622144241-01-retail-returns-overstocked-gotrg-medium-plus-169.jpg" data-src-small="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220622144241-01-retail-returns-overstocked-gotrg-large-169.jpg" data-src-medium="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220622144241-01-retail-returns-overstocked-gotrg-exlarge-169.jpg" data-src-large="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220622144241-01-retail-returns-overstocked-gotrg-super-169.jpg" data-src-full16x9="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220622144241-01-retail-returns-overstocked-gotrg-full-169.jpg" data-src-mini1x1="//cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220622144241-01-retail-returns-overstocked-gotrg-small-11.jpg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0, xsmall: 221, small: 308, medium: 461, large: 781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/></p></div></div></div><p>Refunding customers while simultaneously letting them keep their returns isn&#39;t a new practice, said Rop. &#34;It started with Amazon several years ago,&#34; he said.</p><p>The offer makes sense for some types of products -- lower price-tier bulky items like furniture, kitchen appliances, home decor, baby chairs, walkers, strollers where it&#39;s costly for the retailer to cover the shipping cost for the return.</p><p>&#34;Other products like kids&#39; toys, footwear, towels and bedding raise sanitary concerns when it comes to returns. It could also apply to these categories,&#34; he said. </p><p>Another concern with cheaper items: Stores typically discount returned products, so the amount of money they can make on an inexpensive return is miniscule -- and may not be worth the tradeoff, says Keith Daniels, partner with Carl Marks Advisors.</p><ul data-layout="list-hierarchical-xs"></ul><p>Still, a &#34;keep it&#34; policy has its own disadvantages, namely: Companies will need to ensure that they don&#39;t become victims of fraud.</p><p>&#34;One thing retailers need to track and ensure is that customers that become aware of the [Keep it] policy do not begin to abuse it, by seeking free merchandise over a series of orders by getting a refund but getting to keep the merchandise,&#34; said Daniels.</p></div></div></section></div>
