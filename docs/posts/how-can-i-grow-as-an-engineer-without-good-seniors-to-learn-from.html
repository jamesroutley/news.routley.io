    <h1>Ask HN: How can I grow as an engineer without good seniors to learn from?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I am a fresh graduate data engineer working at a small company in the oil and drilling industry.</p><p>I was hired 6 months ago as a freelance data engineer, and after proving myself through my work quality, I am now essentially functioning as a tech lead, with full responsibility and ownership of designing, implementing, and hiring for the projects I&#39;m assigned.</p><p>Our company is not a tech company, so I only have a couple of tech-oriented colleagues, and I barely interact with them. Now I directly report to the director of the company, who in all senses is awesome, with 40+ years of combined experience in some of the biggest oil and drilling companies globally.</p><p>However, I have some strong FOMO about not being able to learn much technical stuff from my peers or seniors. I am trying my best to learn and pick things up on my own, learning design principles, getting code reviews from chatGPT, etc. But even then, I&#39;m afraid I am not producing the software to the highest standards of the industry since we don&#39;t have any rigorous cross-checking, and might be missing out on a lot of learning.</p><p>Can someone who has been in positions similar to these please guide me?</p></div></div></div>
