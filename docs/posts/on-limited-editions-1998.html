	<p>... On Limited Editions ...</p>
	
	<hr/>
	
	<p>&#39;At the Gallery - Part I&#39;</p>
	<p>A conversation with a guest at one of my exhibitions ... (This was originally written in 1998, but is still an accurate representation of my thinking on this topic.)</p>

	

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
Excuse me, Mr. Bull ... May I speak to you for a minute?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Yes, of
course. Thank you for coming this afternoon.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
I&#39;ve been enjoying the prints on display, but I&#39;m a bit curious about
something I&#39;ve noticed here - your prints don&#39;t have any edition
numbers; are these <i>real</i> limited edition prints?</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Well, yes they
are real, but no they are not limited editions. I never limit my
prints. Carving those blocks takes a long long time, and I would
never destroy them after printing is finished. </p>

<p>But actually that&#39;s not the reason - it&#39;s that I
simply don&#39;t believe in such numbering.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
Why not?</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> The &#39;quick and
easy&#39; answer is that traditionally, Japanese prints never had
numbers. If you think back to the Edo-era in which they originated,
prints were a simple article of commerce. They were not &#39;art&#39;, and
the very idea that they could be considered as &#39;investments&#39; would
have seemed absolutely ridiculous. I simply follow the
tradition.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
Well, that&#39;s all very well, but we&#39;re not in the Edo-era any more.
Print buyers today are somewhat more demanding.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> No, not more
demanding. It is simply that a <i>custom</i> of using edition numbers, and a
<i>custom</i> of limiting the number of prints available have grown up
around us, and most people in the field, both creators and consumers,
have accepted it without thinking about what such habits
signify.</p>

<p>But prints are <i>multiples</i>. It is their whole and
only reason for existence - to allow the &#39;message&#39; to be communicated
to as many people as possible. And when you are dealing with a medium like
woodblock printmaking, where the blocks are capable of making <em>thousands</em> 
of impressions, the very concept of a &#39;limited edition
print&#39; is an oxymoron, a perversion of that idea ... and dishonest to
boot.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
Why do you say &#39;dishonest&#39;? It&#39;s the accepted way of doing
things.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> It
<i>is</i> dishonest. It
is an attempt to maintain an artificially high price for a commodity
by restricting the supply available. When people in other fields try
tricks like this, they are castigated by society, and perhaps even
find themselves in trouble with the law. How on earth is it that the
world of prints has allowed itself to be caught up in this ridiculous
practice? A practice that ultimately, over a century of incremental
subversion, completely destroyed the world of printmaking.
</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
Destroyed?</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Yes,
destroyed. Just look around and count how many people are able to
make their living as printmakers ... what percentage of the
population owns even <i>one</i> woodblock print ... You know the answers.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
But print buyers <i>demand</i> those numbers at the bottom of a print. They help give the
print a tangible value.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> What kind of
value would a printmaker want his prints to have? Should he really
care what financial value they have? Should he want people to collect
his prints as investments? If so, then he should be selling stock
certificates, not prints. </p>

<p>I make prints because I like using my skills to
make beautiful objects out of beautiful materials - cherry wood,
fluffy paper, and soft pigments. Both the process and the result give
me great pleasure. As it happens ... no, not &#39;as it happens&#39;, but
because I have planned well ... people seem to enjoy looking at the
prints I make. Human nature being what it is, a number of these
people also feel the urge to own some of these prints, to take them
home and have them available to look at from time to time. I am happy
to sell them to such people. Neither they nor I are concerned in the
slightest bit about the size of the edition, or how much these prints
will &#39;appreciate&#39; over the years to come. These prints stand simply
as ink-smeared pieces of paper. The only value they carry is that
which exists in the eye of the beholder.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
This is all very well, and very idealistic, but there is no way that
people will pay reasonable prices if the prints don&#39;t have
numbers!</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Reasonable,
eh? There are two definitions of a &#39;reasonable&#39; price for anything -
that of the producer, and that of the consumer - and in the world of
printmaking, these seem at present to be impossibly far apart. Almost
everywhere that I see prints for sale - in galleries, at exhibitions,
on internet web sites, etc. - I see them marked with very high price
tags. These prices are not &#39;reasonable&#39; from the <i>consumer&#39;s</i> point of view - as a
result, very few sales are made, and very few printmakers are thus
making a living by their art.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
But the prices <i>have</i> to be that high. So few prints are sold, that if the
prices were lower, there just wouldn&#39;t be enough revenue to support
the printmaker.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> I think we&#39;re
going to start going around in circles here. To my way of thinking,
dropping the price to the point where &#39;normal&#39; people (not just
wealthy &#39;investors&#39;) could easily afford to buy the prints, would
result in greatly increased sales. Instead of only a few sales - at a
high price, a far greater number of sales would be made - at a lower
price. You just have to find the right combination.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
But that means the printmaker has to make many more copies of each
print. He turns into a labourer - not an artist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Now you&#39;re
talking! That&#39;s what <i>printmaking</i> is all about! To be a printmaker
means to enjoy the process of making prints! One ... two ... three
... four ... Look at them all - they&#39;re beautiful! And I&#39;m making
them with my own hands!</p>

<p>You can&#39;t be afraid of the work. Michelangelo
didn&#39;t just have an artistic &#39;concept&#39; for the Sistine Chapel
ceiling. He got up there on the scaffold and painted and painted and
painted, for month after month after month ... I don&#39;t climb any
scaffolds, but each month I make 200 copies of the current surimono
print. Some of them are around 20 impressions each ... Labourer? You
bet!</p>

<p>That&#39;s what it <i>means</i> to work in the arts - to
have the creative conception, and then to work with your hands to
turn that concept into a real object - no matter how long it may
take. You must do both! And if you don&#39;t like doing it - then you&#39;ve
chosen the wrong field. And think about the result - instead of just
a few prints being sold, mostly to banks and offices to stick up on
the wall as useless decoration, &#39;real&#39; people will be collecting your
work, purely for personal pleasure.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
I&#39;ve got to warn you, without edition numbers not many galleries are
going to carry your prints ...</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> I don&#39;t
<i>want</i> galleries
to carry my prints. What have most galleries come to signify these
days: &#39;fine art&#39; and &#39;elitism&#39; and snobbishness ... Maybe somewhere
in the world there might be galleries that really do act simply as a
&#39;conduit&#39; between artist and consumer, explaining each side to the
other and truly adding value to the transaction, but I think they
must be very few and far between.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
So how will the works be sold? Should every artist open his own
gallery?</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Well, how
about the example you see here? Every single print that I have sold
since I first started has gone from my hands directly to the hands of
the collectors. Once each year (in January) I rent this exhibition
space, show my works, and collect orders. I rent the physical space
only - you may have noticed that none of the gallery staff comes out
&#39;on the floor&#39; during this exhibition; I handle all transactions
myself. What happens during the course of this week determines my
income and living standard for the balance of the year. In the early
years when I was completely unknown, the print income wasn&#39;t enough,
and I had to do other work as well, but since the early 1990&#39;s I&#39;ve
been able to survive on printmaking. So I know that this is possible. 
Produce attractive work, keep the prices reasonable, publicize and promote
yourself well, and nobody will ever care about those damnable edition
numbers.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
But it&#39;s easy for you - you live in Japan. As you said, traditional
Japanese prints never had edition numbers. But overseas it&#39;s
different ...</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> This is the
first objection you&#39;ve raised that I can&#39;t answer with absolute
confidence. Yes, my method is working well here in Japan - but will
it really work anywhere else? I have to say that I think it would;
the Japanese tradition of no edition numbers was a practice of an era
long long gone. Ever since the early part of the 20th century,
printmakers here have followed the numbering habit, and none of them
would ever think of doing otherwise. The entire printmaking and
marketing establishment here works in just the way it does overseas -
everything is based on limited editions. So if I can survive here, I
think I can survive anywhere. But of course, that is only
speculation. If it is of any value to the discussion, let me mention
that just about 25% of my collectors are non-Japanese (American,
European, Australian ...) It really doesn&#39;t seem to make much
difference ...</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
Well Mr. Bull, good luck to you in the next few years... With the
economic situation looking pretty shaky these days, I hope you can
survive alright.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Thanks. Who
knows - perhaps I&#39;ll be back teaching English again soon! I don&#39;t
think any of us ever expects it to be a &#39;piece of cake&#39; making a
living as a woodblock printmaker. But so far, so good ...</p>

<p>Thank you for coming over to talk to me, it&#39;s been
a pleasure!</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Guest:</b>
I&#39;ll look around a bit more, if I may ...</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Dave:</b> Please do ...
Relax and enjoy your visit.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Update (summer 2008): Nothing in my thinking on this topic has changed in the intervening years. I mentioned about 25% of my collectors being overseas; that number runs about 50% these days (thanks of course to the internet).</p>
