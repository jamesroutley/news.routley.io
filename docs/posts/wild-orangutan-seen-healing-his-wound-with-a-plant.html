    <h1>Wild orangutan seen healing his wound with a plant</h1>

We are more similar than we are different,&#34; said biologist Dr Isabella Laumer at the Max Planck institute in Germany and lead author of the research.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A research team in the Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia spotted Rakus with a large wound on his cheek in June 2022.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>They believe he was injured fighting with rival male orangutans because he made loud cries called &#34;long calls&#34; in the days before they saw the wound.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The team then saw Rakus chewing the stem and leaves of plant called Akar Kuning - an anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial plant that is also used locally to treat malaria and diabetes.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Armas</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Scientists saw Rakus chewing a medicinal leaf into a paste</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>He repeatedly applied the liquid onto his cheek for seven minutes. Rakus then smeared the chewed leaves onto his wound until it was fully covered. He continued to feed on the plant for over 30 minutes.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The paste and leaves then appear to have done their magic - the researchers saw no sign of infection and the wound closed within five days.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>After a month, Rakus was fully healed.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><p><span><span></span></span><span role="text"><span>Image source, </span>Safruddin</span></p><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>After a month, the wound on Rakus&#39;s cheek was healed</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The scientists concluded that Rakus knew he was applying medicine because orangutans very rarely eat this particular plant and because of the length of the treatment.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;He repeatedly applied the paste, and he later also applied more solid plant matter. The entire process lasted really a considerable amount of time - that&#39;s why we think that he intentionally applied it,&#34; explains Dr Laumer.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The researchers also saw Rakus resting for much longer than usual - more than half of the day - suggesting he was trying to recuperate after the injury.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Scientists were already aware that great apes used medicine to try to heal themselves. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In the 1960s biologist Jane Goodall saw whole leaves in the faeces of chimpanzees, and others documented seeing great apes swallowing leaves with medicinal properties.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But they had never seen a wild animal applying a plant to a wound.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Dr Laumer says it is possible that it was the first time Rakus had done this type of treatment. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;It could be that he accidentally touched his wound with his finger that had the plant on it.  And then because the plant has quite potent pain relieving substances he might have felt immediate pain relief, which made him apply it again and again,&#34; she says. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Or he could have learned the method from watching other orangutans in his group.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The researchers will now be closely watching other orangutans to see if they can spot the same medical skills that Rakus showed.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>&#34;I think in the next few years we will discover even more behaviours and more abilities that are very human-like,&#34; she suggests. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The research is published in the scientific journal Scientific Reports.</p></div></article></main></div></div>
