 My Time at MIT

<p>Twenty years ago, in 2004-2005, I spent a year at MIT’s Computer Science department as a postdoc working with Professor Nancy Lynch. It was an extraordinary experience. Life at MIT felt like paradise, and leaving felt like being cast out.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoZE-0eOmKIQ1Z9jrcV_5e1KOny0ho0QAt-qP_asRcIKYan9UcCJDNyyHoxv7np-wV2bqoz2GkNTOqV9n4ImSywp2XunMcOq1euWAe1MN91FMDQedy4RyHbUx4zbdDnYXatF5lQFnbj0EXEpRC8xggO3cuC5VgnpB8fApgnKE50tItZGMzjcsolWTw1kk/s580/stata.jpg"><img data-original-height="429" data-original-width="580" height="296" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoZE-0eOmKIQ1Z9jrcV_5e1KOny0ho0QAt-qP_asRcIKYan9UcCJDNyyHoxv7np-wV2bqoz2GkNTOqV9n4ImSywp2XunMcOq1euWAe1MN91FMDQedy4RyHbUx4zbdDnYXatF5lQFnbj0EXEpRC8xggO3cuC5VgnpB8fApgnKE50tItZGMzjcsolWTw1kk/w400-h296/stata.jpg" width="400"/></a></p></div>

<h3><a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2023/10/hints-for-distributed-systems-design.html">Hints for Distributed Systems Design</a></h3>

<div>
<div>
<p>
This is with apologies to Butler Lampson, who published the &#34; Hints for computer system design &#34; paper 40 years ago in SOSP&#39;83. I don&#39;t claim to match that work of course. I just thought I could draft this post to organize my thinking about designing distributed systems and get feedback from others. I start with the same  disclaimer Lampson gave. These hints are not novel, not foolproof recipes, not laws of design, not precisely formulated, and not always appropriate. They are just hints.  They are context dependent, and some of them may be controversial. That being said, I have seen these hints successfully applied in distributed systems design throughout my 25 years in the field, starting from the theory of distributed systems (98-01), immersing into the practice of wireless sensor networks (01-11), and working on cloud computing systems both in the academia and industry ever since. These heuristic principles have been applied knowingly or unknowingly and has proven...

<h3><a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2020/06/learning-about-distributed-systems.html"> Learning about distributed systems: where to start?</a></h3>

<div>
<div>
<p>
This is definitely not a &#34;learn distributed systems in 21 days&#34; post. I recommend a principled, from the foundations-up, studying of distributed systems, which will take a good three months in the first pass, and many more months to build competence after that.   If you are practical and coding oriented you may not like my advice much. You may object saying, &#34;Shouldn&#39;t I learn distributed systems with coding and hands on? Why can I not get started by deploying a Hadoop cluster, or studying the Raft code.&#34; I think that is the wrong way to go about learning distributed systems, because seeing similar code and programming language constructs will make you think this is familiar territory, and will give you a false sense of security. But, nothing can be further from the truth.   Distributed systems need radically different software than centralized systems do.    --A. Tannenbaum  This quotation is literally the first sentence in my distributed systems syllabus. Inst...

C. J. Date&#39;s Sigmod 1983 keynote, &#34;Database Usability&#34;, was prescient. Usability is the most important thing to the customers. They care less about impressive benchmarks or clever algorithms, and more about whether they can operate and use a database efficiently to query, update, analyze, and persist their data with minimal headache. (BTW, does anyone have a link to the contents of this Sigmod&#39;83 talk? There is no transcript around, except for this short abstract .) The paper we cover today is from Sigmod 2007.  It takes on the database usability problem raised in that 1983 keynote head-on, and calls out that the king is still naked.  Let&#39;s give some context for the year 2007. Yes, XML format was still popular then. The use-case in the paper is XQuery. The paper does not contain any  reference to json. MongoDB would be released in 2009 with the document model; and that seems to be great timing for some of the usability pains mentioned in the paper! Web 2.0 was in ...

<h3><a href="http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/08/looming-liability-machines.html">Looming Liability Machines (LLMs)</a></h3>

<div>
<div>
<p>
As part of our zoom reading group ( wow, 4.5 years old now ), we discussed a paper that uses LLMs for automatic root cause analysis (RCA) for cloud incidents. This was a pretty straightforward application of LLMs. The proposed system employs an LLM to match incoming incidents to incident handlers based on their alert types, predicts the incident&#39;s root cause category, and provides an explanatory narrative. The only customization is through prompt-engineering. Since this is a custom domain, I think a more principled and custom-designed  machine learning system would be more appropriate rather than adopting LLMs. Anyways, the use of LLMs for RCAs spooked me vicerally. I couldn&#39;t find the exact words during the paper discussion, but I can articulate this better now. Let me explain. RCA is serious business Root cause analysis (RCA) is the process of identifying the underlying causes of a problem/incident, rather than just addressing its symptoms. One RCA heuristic is asking 5 Why...

This paper  is from Pat Helland, the apostate philosopher of database systems, overall a superb person, and a good friend of mine. The paper appeared this week at CIDR&#39;24. (Check out the program  for other interesting papers). The motivating question behind this work is: &#34; What are the asymptotic limits to scale for cloud OLTP (OnLine Transaction Processing) systems? &#34; Pat says that the CIDR 2023 paper &#34;Is Scalable OLTP in the Cloud a Solved Problem?&#34;  prompted this question.  The answer to the question? Pat says that the answer lies in the joint responsibility of database and the application. If you know of Pat&#39;s work, which I have summarized several in this blog , you would know that Pat has been advocating along these lines before. But this paper provides a very crisp, specific, concrete answer. Read on for my summary of the paper. Disclaimer: This is a wisdom and technical information/detail packed 13-page paper, so I will try my best to summarize the sa...

I notice I haven&#39;t written any advice posts recently. Here is a collection of my advice posts pre 2020. I&#39;ve been feeling all this elderly wisdom pent up in me, ready to pour at any moment. So here it goes. Get ready to quench your thirst from my fount of wisdom. No man, think for yourself, only get what works for you. It is called foundations, not theory Foundations of computer science (or rather any field of study) are the most important topics you can learn. These lay down the frame of thinking/perspective for that area of study. Yet, I am saddened to hear these called as &#34;theory&#34;, and labeled as &#34;unpractical&#34;. This couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. Take a look at how I recommend studying distributed systems . Don&#39;t you dare call this &#34;theory&#34; and &#34;unpractical&#34;. This lays the bedrock that you build your practice on. Don&#39;t skimp on the foundations. Don&#39;t build your home on quicksand. Keep your hands dirty, your mind cl...

I talked about the importance of reading foundational papers  last week. To followup, here is my compilation of foundational papers in the distributed systems area. (I focused on the core distributed systems area, and did not cover networking, security, distributed ledgers, verification work etc. I even left out distributed transactions, I hope to cover them at a later date.)  I classified the papers by subject, and listed them in chronological order.

This paper appeared in July at USENIX ATC 2023. If you haven&#39;t read about the architecture and operation of DynamoDB, please first read my summary of the DynamoDB ATC 2022 paper . The big omission in that paper was discussion about transactions. This paper amends that. It is great to see DynamoDB, and AWS in general, is publishing/sharing more widely than before. Overview A killer feature of DynamoDB is predictability at any scale. Do read Marc Brooker&#39;s post to fully appreciate this feature. Aligned with this predictability tenet, when adding transactions to DynamoDB, the first and primary constraint was to preserve the predictable high performance of single-key reads/writes at any scale. The second big constraint was to implement transactions using update in-place operation without multi-version concurrency control. The reason for this was they didn&#39;t want to mock with the storage layer which did not support multi-versioning. Satisfying both of the above constraints may s...

This paper is from Herlihy and Wing appeared in ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 1990.  This is the canonical reference for the linearizability definition. I had not read this paper in detail before, so I thought it would be good to go to the source to see if there are additional delightful surprises in the original text. Hence, this post. I will dive into a technical analysis of the paper first, and then discuss some of my takes toward the end. I had written an accessible explanation of linearizability earlier; you may want to read that first.  I will assume an understanding of linearizability to keep this review at reasonable length. Introduction I love how the old papers just barge in with the model, without bothered by pleasantries such as motivation of the problem. These are the first two sentences of the introduction. &#34;A concurrent system consists of a collection of sequential processes that communicate through shared typed objects . This model encompass...
