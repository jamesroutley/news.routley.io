    <h1>Typography 2024: For America’s Best</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="doc"><p>This year’s slate of 11 Re­pub­li­can can­di­dates for pres­i­dent seems like an amuse-bouche com­pared to 2020, when there were <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-2020.html">27 De­mo­c­ra­tic <span>candidates.</span></a></p><p>To re­veal one of my most con­trar­ian opin­ions: I’ve never un­der­stood the re­cur­ring cri­tique of Amer­i­can pres­i­den­tial pol­i­tics that we have <em>too many</em> can­di­dates. (Sam­ple alarmist think-piece head­line: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/too-much-democracy-is-bad-for-democracy/600766/"><dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull>“Too</dquo-open-pull> Much Democ­racy Is Bad For Democ­racy”.</a>) What’s the ish? That’s why it’s called an elec­tion. Be­sides, if you want to carp about the un­in­tended con­se­quences of too much choice, why not point your laser beams at the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/origins-foundations/senate-and-constitution/seventeenth-amendment.htm">17th amend­ment</a> to the US Con­sti­tu­tion? A lot more could be said about <em>that</em>, I as­sure <span>you.</span></p><p>Even more con­fus­ing is the qua­dren­nial <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/06/cornel-west-no-labels-joe-manchin-third-party-biden-spoiler-candidate-2024-election.html">hand-wring­ing</a> about so-called<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “spoiler</dquo-open-pull> can­di­dates”, a pe­jo­ra­tion that keeps slouch­ing to­ward nor­mal­ized use, sort of like<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “friv­o­lous</dquo-open-pull> law­suit”. Let’s keep the blame for<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “spoil­ing”</dquo-open-pull> any elec­tion where it be­longs—with the peo­ple who <span>voted.</span></p><p>Largely, how­ever, I think these the­o­ries are pro­moted by po­lit­i­cal jour­nal­ists as a means of pro­tect­ing their own hoary nar­ra­tives of pres­i­den­tial pol­i­tics. Here’s mine: It’s chaotic. It’s weird. No­body knows any­thing. Thus, eval­u­at­ing the can­di­dates through the de­sign &amp; ty­pog­ra­phy of their cam­paign web­sites is as valid a method as any. If you think oth­er­wise, you’re a ty­po­graphic <span>spoiler.</span></p><p>The web­sites of the <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-2020.html">2020 can­di­dates</a> were not mir­a­cles of orig­i­nal­ity. Though even com­pared to that mid­dling stan­dard, the 2024 can­di­dates have con­verged even more force­fully around a small set of ty­pog­ra­phy, color, and nav­i­ga­tion <span>choices.</span></p><p>As for color—though the de­sign­ers of the US flag re­al­ized that red and blue have poor con­trast and thus shouldn’t over­lap each other, pres­i­den­tial can­di­dates con­tinue to strug­gle with this un­avoid­able op­ti­cal <span>reality.</span></p><p>I rec­og­nize that the point of these web­sites is 1) to raise money and 2) … huh? what? Still, I’m mys­ti­fied by the com­plete lack of in­ter­est in dis­till­ing the can­di­date’s pitch to any kind of con­crete ar­gu­ment. In an elec­tion, isn’t the ma­jor ques­tion<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “Why</dquo-open-pull> you and not the other one?” Why can no one an­swer this? The av­er­age Dori­tos ad­ver­tise­ment makes a bet­ter <span>case.</span></p><p><dquo-open-pull>“Well,</dquo-open-pull> dif­fer­ent vot­ers have dif­fer­ent pref­er­ences.” Nah, I don’t be­lieve it. I ab­solutely could win in 2028. My slo­gan:<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “More</dquo-open-pull> money for every­one. And na­cho cheesier fla­vor <span>too.”</span></p><p>Un­til then, how­ever, these are your <span>choices.</span></p><p><a href="https://joebiden.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/biden.jpg"/></a></p><p>Biden’s re­elec­tion site is largely a step down from <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-2020.html#joe-biden">his very good 2020 ef­fort.</a> The fonts have been up­graded to the ex­cel­lent <a href="https://www.typography.com/blog/introducing-decimal">Dec­i­mal</a> and the Caslon-in­spired <a href="https://commercialtype.com/catalog/frame">Frame.</a> Oth­er­wise, how­ever, it’s just weird: the cream-col­ored back­ground, the Mor­tal Kom­bat-in­spired tagline <em>fin­ish the job</em>, the scrib­bles on the page pur­port­ing to be Joe’s hand­writ­ing, and new wavy stripes in the Biden word­mark rem­i­nis­cent of An­drew Yang’s <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-2020.html#andrew-yang">ba­conesque 2020 logo.</a> A quin­tes­sen­tial ex­am­ple of what hap­pens in de­sign projects when a large bud­get is handed over to a large com­mit­tee: by try­ing to be every­thing to every­one, it avoids be­ing any­thing to <span>anyone.</span></p><p><a href="https://marianne2024.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/williamson.jpg"/></a></p><p>A per­plex­ing en­try for those hop­ing that Williamson’s re­turn to pres­i­den­tial pol­i­tics would be even wilder <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-2020.html#marianne-williamson">than 2020’s.</a> Williamson’s web­site is de­void of vi­sual in­ter­est, even com­pared to other 2024 can­di­dates—and a ma­jor step down from the <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-2020.html#marianne-williamson">arty self-por­trait</a> she re­lied on last time. If you’re Mar­i­anne Williamson, why aren’t you swing­ing for the fences? Act­ing pres­i­den­tial was never go­ing to be your lane. The fonts are <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins">Pop­pins</a> (which she used in 2020 too) and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Faustina">Faustina.</a></p><p><a href="http://kennedy24.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/kennedy.jpg"/></a></p><p>The only good thing about Robert Kennedy’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/robert-kennedy-jr-presidential-campaign-9fb5ed5c8e1fd31d2a4458d44b086593">cam­paign</a> is the lac­er­at­ing <em>Curb Your En­thu­si­asm</em> episode that it will even­tu­ally in­spire. The fonts are nice—<a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/freight-sans">Freight Sans</a> and <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/source-serif">Source Serif</a> (which I <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/free-fonts.html">have rec­om­mended</a>)—and so far haven’t killed <span>anyone.</span></p><p><a href="https://donaldjtrump.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/trump.jpg"/></a></p><p>I doubt that any fu­ture bi­og­ra­phy of Don­ald Trump will note that his 2020 cam­paign man­ager, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/denizcam/2017/12/06/from-web-designer-to-trumps-digital-confidant-brad-parscale/?sh=a2c8b316e9e4">Brad Parscale,</a> started out as his 2016 web de­signer. Sad! No idea who’s pulling the strings in 2024. Given Trump’s pre­oc­coupa­tion with at-least-ba­sic-ca­ble pro­duc­tion val­ues, the shoddy photo edit­ing and other signs of cor­ner-cut­ting are a sur­prise. (Given Trump’s <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/08/26/trump-never-pays-his-bills-truth-social-reportedly-stiffs-contractor-amid-financial-disarray/">leg­endary ven­dor-stiff­ing,</a> maybe not.) Ac­cord­ing to the web-page markup, the head­line font is sup­posed to be the <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-2020.html#the-gotham-administration">Gotham knock­off</a> <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat">Montser­rat,</a> but ap­par­ently some­one for­got to up­load it—or walked off the job be­fore they could—so Hel­vetica is be­ing dis­played in­stead. The other font is the Gotham knock­off <a href="https://www.1001fonts.com/metropolis-font.html">Me­trop­o­lis.</a> No idea why one Gotham knock­off wouldn’t have suf­ficed. Or one <span>term.</span></p><p><a href="https://nikkihaley.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/haley.jpg"/></a></p><p>Nikki Ha­ley is cur­rently <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/2024/national/">polling at 4% na­tion­ally,</a> yet her home page de­picts her as one small face in a crowd. All she’s miss­ing is a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Women-s-Where-s-Waldo-Wenda-Costume/534535101">Where’s Waldo</a> out­fit. I men­tioned the red–blue con­trast prob­lem—Ha­ley’s logo is hope­less be­cause every time it sits atop blue or gray, the<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “Ha­ley”</dquo-open-pull> largely dis­ap­pears. The whole thing just comes across as a cry for help. The fonts are the Google-made <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Ro­boto</a> and the Russ­ian-made <a href="https://www.paratype.com/fonts/pt/futura-pt">Fu­tura <span>PT.</span></a></p><p><a href="https://vivek2024.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/ramaswamy.jpg"/></a></p><p>Vivek Ra­maswamy is the fic­tional pres­i­den­tial can­di­date I would ex­pect to find in a Grand Theft Auto game. Though con­sid­er­ing he did <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/05/03/wikipedia-editor-says-they-were-paid-to-change-vivek-ramaswamys-page/">pay off a Wikipedia ed­i­tor,</a> plac­ing his prod­uct into a video game might’ve been money bet­ter spent. To be fair, I rather like his strange logo, which I choose to read as a se­cret homage to that of <a href="http://www.van-halen.com/">Van Halen.</a> Thus, a missed op­por­tu­nity to de­ploy the slo­gan <a href="https://www.vhnd.com/a-different-kind-of-truth/"><em>(A Dif­fer­ent Kind of) Truth.</em></a> The dis­play font is the bland but well-made <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/acumin">Acumin;</a> text is the even blander <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans">Open <span>Sans.</span></a></p><p><a href="https://asa2024.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/hutchinson.jpg"/></a></p><p>Asa? Wowza. Some can­di­dates want to end Amer­ica’s for­ever wars. Hutchin­son ap­par­ently plans to open a new front against the Eng­lish lan­guage it­self. On the other hand, the pre­vi­ous ad­min­is­tra­tion wanted us to <a href="https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/bebest/"><dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull>“Be</dquo-open-pull> Best”.</a> Per­haps<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “For</dquo-open-pull> Amer­ica’s Best” is the nat­ural next step. The web­site blends the 1970s clas­sic <a href="https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/7277/itc-grouch">Grouch</a> with pos­si­ble fu­ture clas­sic <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/glacial-indifference">Glacial In­dif­fer­ence.</a> (Based on those font names, I’m de­tect­ing that Hutchin­son may be the vic­tim of a prank by a web de­signer less loyal than <a href="#donald-trump">Brad Parscale.</a>) For good mea­sure, there’s also some <a href="https://typographyforlawyers.com/a-brief-history-of-times-new-roman.html">TNR</a> in the logo. I’m a lit­tle sur­prised that Hutchin­son chose not to align him­self with an­other for­mer Arkansas gov­er­nor, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Left-Lie-Triangulations-Jefferson/dp/1455522996">Bill Clin­ton,</a> who as­cended to the pres­i­dency and then de­liv­ered on many Re­pub­li­can leg­isla­tive <span>priorities.</span></p><p><a href="https://larryelder.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/elder.jpg"/></a></p><p>Larry El­der’s site dis­tin­guishes it­self by not be­ing com­pletely in­ept. It’s a low bar this year. Like <a href="#joe-biden">Joe Biden,</a> the stripes in his logo come across as ba­conesque, or maybe streaks left by a star-shaped sponge on a wind­shield. (<a href="#ron-desantis">Ron De­San­tis</a> shows how to ren­der stripes cor­rectly.) Mostly it’s a prob­lem of scale, how­ever: there’s not enough room in the cor­ner for that kind of de­tail to be leg­i­ble. The bor­ing free fonts are <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans">Open Sans</a> and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto">Ro­boto.</a></p><p><a href="https://votetimscott.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/scott.jpg"/></a></p><p>Tim Scott ap­par­ently took a break from his va­ca­tion to an­nounce that yeah, what the heck—why not run for pres­i­dent? I haven’t ruled out the pos­si­bil­ity that he took this photo with a selfie stick. As for the logo, the cam­paign team ap­par­ently said<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “Has</dquo-open-pull> any­one in Con­gress named Tim run re­cently? Oh really, <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-2020.html#tim-ryan">De­mo­c­rat Tim Ryan?</a> He’s not us­ing his logo any­more, right?” Scott is us­ing one of the bet­ter fonts seen in a cam­paign this year, called <a href="https://fortfoundry.com/fonts/rift">Rift.</a></p><p><a href="https://rondesantis.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/desantis.jpg"/></a></p><p>I feel a lit­tle bad for Ron De­San­tis. Like <a href="#nikki-haley">Nikki Ha­ley,</a> ac­tu­ally be­ing a pres­i­den­tial can­di­date seems to en­chant him less than cos­play­ing one did. The web­site looks like the de­fault theme that shipped with Word­Press in 2009, with a strange gra­di­ent back­ground that blends deep red and blue to make deep sludge. The logo is pinched from Net­flix (by way of <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-2020.html#pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a>). The good news: the stripes ac­tu­ally look wavy; the bad news: they cast us into an un­canny val­ley where the US only has three states, rep­re­sented by those mi­nus­cule stars. Un­like other can­di­dates, the De­San­tis web­site spec­i­fies no fonts, in­stead re­ly­ing on the sys­tem fonts on each de­vice. This is mys­ti­fy­ing, yet <span>perfect.</span></p><p><a href="https://mikepence2024.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/pence.jpg"/></a></p><p>Pence’s <a href="https://mikepence2024.com/about/michael-r-pence/">cap­sule bi­og­ra­phy</a> com­pletely omits every­thing that hap­pened be­tween Jan­u­ary 2017 and Jan­u­ary 2021, in­clu­sive. Ac­cen­tu­ate the pos­i­tive, I guess? Pence’s web­site also omits any men­tion of where he stands on the is­sues. For­tu­nately it does in­clude one of his <a href="https://mikepence2024.com/about/michael-r-pence/">wed­ding pho­tos.</a> Pence may want to be care­ful with the name-in-box logo, a mo­tif sim­i­lar to that of a can­di­date whose name Pence would pre­fer I not men­tion, but it rhymes with <a href="#donald-trump">Tronald Dump.</a> Dis­play font is <a href="https://typejockeys.com/font/antonia">An­to­nia;</a> text is the Russ­ian-made <a href="https://www.paratype.com/fonts/pt/futura-pt">Fu­tura <span>PT.</span></a></p><p><a href="https://chrischristie.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/christie.jpg"/></a></p><p><dquo-open-pull>“Be­cause</dquo-open-pull> the Truth Mat­ters”—ac­cord­ing to the man who claims he had noth­ing to do with traf­fic-based ret­ri­bu­tion against the mayor of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/nyregion/george-washington-bridge-scandal-what-you-need-to-know.html">Fort Lee, New Jer­sey</a> in 2013 that led to fed­eral con­vic­tions for two of his aides (later over­turned on ap­peal). Speak­ing as a New Hamp­shire na­tive, I can also lay some truth on you, bro—you’re not go­ing to make it to the sec­ond pri­mary. Font is <a href="https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/proxima-nova">Prox­ima <span>Nova.</span></a></p><p><a href="https://dougburgum.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/burgum.jpg"/></a></p><p>Bur­gum is a pe­cu­liar can­di­date with a pe­cu­liar web­site. Thou­sands of copies of the mes­sage<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “Text</dquo-open-pull> DOUG to 7017” plod end­lessly across the top, as if once weren’t enough. The rest of the web­site scrolls hor­i­zon­tally when you try to scroll ver­ti­cally, for no good rea­son. Bur­gum at least tries to squeeze the ac­tual US flag into his logo rather than ba­conize it like <a href="#larry-elder">Larry El­der.</a> I also like that he &amp; his wife picked out color-ap­pro­pri­ate out­fits for the photo shoot. The dis­play font is the play­ful and good-na­tured <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/bourton-font-kimmy-design?tab=individualStyles">Bour­ton.</a></p><p><a href="https://fxs24.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/suarez.jpg"/></a></p><p>The idea of go­ing jog­ging with a pres­i­den­tial can­di­date is not hugely ap­peal­ing to me. Though Mi­ami mayor Fran­cis Suarez is not the first to try it—see also <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-2020.html#wayne-messam">Wayne Mes­sam,</a> an­other Florid­ian who cam­paigned in 2020. As jour­nal­ists have noted, Suarez doesn’t ac­tu­ally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/15/us/politics/francis-suarez-president.html">do much all day</a> ex­cept post spicy tweets about cryp­tocur­rency. Which im­me­di­ately makes him a 2024 fron­trun­ner. De­sign­ers for <a href="#ron-desantis">Ron De­San­tis</a> take note—this back­ground gra­di­ent uses lighter, more sat­u­rated col­ors on the edges so the mid­dle doesn’t get sludgy. Con­sid­er­ing this page looks like it took about 25 min­utes to make—in­clud­ing a logo con­cept stolen from <a href="#donald-trump">Trump</a>—it’s not bad. It re­mains to be seen, how­ever, what ex­actly Suarez is go­ing to help us<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “get</dquo-open-pull> started”, but if it’s any­thing other than<dquo-open-push></dquo-open-push><dquo-open-pull> “this</dquo-open-pull> party”, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRINgISPUWQ">will be very dis­ap­pointed.</a> Dis­play font is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat">Montser­rat;</a> text is <span>Verdana.</span></p><p><a href="https://cornelwest24.com"><img src="https://practicaltypography.com/images/candidates-2024/small/west.jpg"/></a></p><p>West seems to be chan­nel­ing the mono­chro­matic stylings of <a href="https://practicaltypography.com/typography-2020.html#beto-orourke">Beto O’Rourke,</a> who lost con­sec­u­tive races for US Sen­ate, US Pres­i­dent, and Texas gov­er­nor.
