    <p>I’ve been trying to slowly ease into using LLMs for coding help again lately (after quitting <a href="https://kix.dev/complacency-is-the-clear-and-present-danger/">cold turkey</a>), but something always feels off -- like we’re not quite on the same wavelength. Call it vibe coding or <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/">vibe engineering</a>, but I think I’ve finally pinned down two big reasons why their approach to code feels so awkward.</p>
<ol>
<li>LLMs don’t copy-paste (or cut and paste) code. For instance, when you ask them to refactor a big file into smaller ones, they’ll &#34;remember&#34; a block or slice of code, use a <code>delete</code> tool on the old file, and then a <code>write</code> tool to spit out the extracted code from memory. There are no real <code>cut</code> or <code>paste</code> tools. Every tweak is just them emitting <code>write</code> commands from memory. This feels weird because, as humans, we lean on copy-paste all the time. It’s how we know the code we moved is exactly the same as where we copied it from. I&#39;ve only seen Codex go against the grain here, sometimes I&#39;d see it issue <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> to try and replicate that copy-paste interaction, but it doesn&#39;t always work.</li>
<li>And it’s not just how they handle code movement -- their whole approach to problem-solving feels alien too. LLMs are terrible at asking questions. They just make a bunch of assumptions and brute-force something based on those guesses. Good human developers always pause to ask before making big changes or when they’re unsure (hence the mantra of <em>&#34;there are no bad questions&#34;</em>). But LLMs? They keep trying to make it work until they hit a wall -- and then they just keep banging their head against it. Sure, you can overengineer your prompt to try get them to ask more questions (Roo for example, does a decent job at this) -- but it&#39;s very likely they still won&#39;t. Maybe the companies building these LLMs do their RL based on making writing code &#34;faster&#34;.</li>
</ol>
<p>These quirks are why I contest the idea that LLMs are replacing human devs -- they’re still more like weird, overconfident interns. I can’t fully vibe with them yet.</p>
