    <h1>When (if ever) did the Sun set on the British Empire?</h1>

	<p id="question">When (if ever) did the Sun finally set on the British Empire?</p>
<p id="attribute">—Kurt Amundson</p>
<p>It hasn&#39;t. Yet. But only because of a few dozen people living in an area
smaller than Disney World.</p>
<p><strong>The world&#39;s largest empire</strong></p>
<p>The British Empire spanned the globe. This led to the saying that the
Sun never set on it, since it was always daytime somewhere in the
Empire.</p>
<p>It&#39;s hard to figure out exactly when this long daylight began.  The
whole process of claiming a colony (on land already occupied by other
people) is awfully arbitrary in the first place. Essentially, the
British built their empire by sailing around and sticking flags on
random beaches.<sup><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEx5G-GOS1k">[1]</a></sup> This
makes it hard to decide when a particular spot in a country was
&#34;officially&#34; added to the Empire.</p>

<p>The exact day when the Sun stopped setting on the Empire was probably
sometime in the late 1700s or early 1800s, when the first Australian
territories were
added.<sup><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/empire/map/">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>The Empire largely disintegrated in the early 20th century,
but—surprisingly—the Sun hasn&#39;t technically started setting on it again.</p>
<p><strong>Fourteen territories</strong></p>
<p>Britain has fourteen overseas territories, the direct remnants of the
British
Empire.<sup><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/london-wikileaks/8305236/A-GUIDE-TO-THE-BRITISH-OVERSEAS-TERRITORIES.html">[3]</a></sup></p>

<p><em>(Many newly-independent British colonies joined the <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations">Commonwealth of
Nations</a></strong>. Some
of them, like Canada and Australia, have Queen Elizabeth as their
official monarch. But they are independent states which happen to have
the same queen; they are not part of any empire that they know of.)</em></p>
<p>The Sun never sets on all fourteen British territories at once (or even
thirteen, if you don’t count the British Antarctic Territory). However,
if the UK loses one tiny territory, it will experience its first
Empire-wide sunset in over two centuries.</p>
<p>Every night, around midnight GMT, the Sun sets on the Cayman Islands,
and doesn&#39;t rise over the British Indian Ocean Territory until after
1:00 AM. For that hour, the little Pitcairn Islands in the South Pacific
are the only British territory in the Sun.</p>
<p>The Pitcairn Islands have a population of a few dozen people, the
descendants of the mutineers from the HMS Bounty. The islands became
notorious in 2004 when a third of the adult male population, including
the mayor, were convicted of child sexual
abuse.<sup><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/01/pitcairn200801">[4]</a></sup><sup><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=103569364">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>As awful as the islands may be, they remain part of the British Empire,
and unless they&#39;re kicked out, the two-century-long British daylight
will continue.</p>
<p><strong>Will it last </strong><em><strong>forever</strong></em><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>Well, maybe.</p>
<p>Four hundred years from now, in April of 2432, the island will
experience its first total solar eclipse since the mutineers
arrived.<sup><a href="http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/JSEX/JSEX-index.html">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Luckily for the Empire, the eclipse happens at a time when the Sun is
over the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean. Those areas won&#39;t see a total
eclipse; the Sun will even still be shining in London.</p>
<p>In fact, no total eclipse for the next thousand years will pass over the
Pitcairn Islands at the right time of day to end the streak. If the UK
keeps its current territories and borders, it can stretch out the
daylight for a long, long time.</p>
<p>But not forever. Eventually—many millennia in the future—an eclipse will
come for the island, and the Sun will finally set on the British Empire.</p>
