    <h1>Notes from Pat Metheny Show</h1>

        <p>I was recently re-reading my good friend’s <a href="https://suneinyneeenan.github.io/Blog/">blog</a> and was inspired by the way they post/share unedited notes. I took some notes from a Pat Metheny show I saw last week (it was awesome) - he said he doesn’t normally talk so I jotted down something about most of what he said. I don’t know how helpful any of it is, the most tangible thing in there are some of the baritone guitar notes/tunings</p>

<h2>Pat Metheny Notes</h2>

<p>Four and more
Seven steps to heaven</p>

<p>There weren’t that many guitar players in Kansas City, so he got to start working</p>

<p>Jimmy smith trio</p>

<p>Trumpet everybody thinks same thing with
Trumpet</p>

<p>But guitar has no single definition
Everybody thinks something different
Emphasis when he said Segovia lol
There’s something important about that
Also Chet atkins was one of the examples</p>

<p>He’s playing a nylon baritone Martin looking thing</p>

<p>He joined Gary burton</p>

<p>He met Charlie Haden, big hero, from Keith jarrett quartet</p>

<p>Invited Charlie to play on 8081
Became super tight with Charlie, was best man at Charlie’s wedding</p>

<p>Played with a ton of people together</p>

<p>Charlie mentioned they could do a duet record sometime , they were friends but Charlie was still an idol</p>

<p>Charlie said to bring acoustic guitars 
Charlie duet album is cult hit</p>

<p>People had that record and didn’t have either of pat or Charlie’s other records</p>

<p>Ending a song with thumb strum but don’t get quiet</p>

<p>Common studio technique, baritone guitar with pick doubling the bass</p>

<p>Tune middle 2 strings of baritone guitar up an octave (neighbor said only way it works?)</p>

<p>One quiet night was from 6hours of middle two string octave play</p>

<p>Hit the flat 9 by mistake, held it !</p>

<p>The baritone tuning he thinks of three two stringed instruments, viola violin cello</p>

<p>Pat did whole new album on nylon baritone with the octave tuning coming out in a few weeks</p>

<p>Played autumn leaves</p>

<p>Now he’s olaying another tune with the same process, plays the bass line on a loop pedal, then jams over it. Could be show shtick, but seems like a cool practice, the autumn leaves bass loop was really long, a lot to remember and then it’s super cool when it locks in with the guitar</p>
