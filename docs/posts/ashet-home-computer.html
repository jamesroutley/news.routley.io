    <h1>Ashet Home Computer</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
    The Ashet Home Computer is an expandable and hackable computer in the spirit of the 80&#39;s home computers.

    Fully understandable by a single person, yet powerful enough to run a graphical desktop OS, it tries to bridge the gap between Arduinos and a RaspberryPi.

    It is designed and engineered for fun and learning, which go best hand in hand.
  </p><div><h2>Project Status &amp; Roadmap</h2><h3><img src="https://ashet.computer/img/check.svg"/> Design</h3><p>The Ashet Home Computer has completed its design phase, and a practical, achievable hardware concept is now finalized.</p><p>There are still many smaller design components to be refined, but the overall concept is done.</p><p><em>Check out the <a href="https://ashet.computer/hardware/">hardware design</a> to learn more about the system.</em></p><h3><img src="https://ashet.computer/img/check.svg"/> Prototyping</h3><p>A functional <em>cable clutter prototype</em> has been created which validates all of the design ideas.</p><p>This includes:</p><ul><li>PSRAM Support</li><li>DVI Video Generation</li><li>Backplane Communication</li><li>Expansion Card Drivers</li><li>Ethernet</li><li>I²C Subsystem</li></ul><p>Currently, the RP2350 processor successfully boots the operating system and supports launching desktop applications.</p><p>The mechanical design is also validated by building a mock-up of the final hardware and case assembly.</p><p><em>Check out the prototype images and videos in the <a href="https://ashet.computer/gallery/#home-computer-photo">gallery</a>!</em></p><h3><img src="https://ashet.computer/img/wrench-clock.svg"/> Engineering</h3><p>The next stage after prototyping will be the actual engineering. This includes creating schematics, pcb layouts, evaluation of hardware limits and EMI emissions.</p><p>In this phase, the fully production-ready computer will be built.</p><p>To fund development for this critical next stage, we will launch a crowdfunding campaign on a platform such as Indiegogo or Kickstarter.</p><p><em>Subscribe to our <a href="https://buttondown.com/ashet.computer" target="_blank">newsletter</a> to get notified when the fundraiser starts!</em></p><h3><img src="https://ashet.computer/img/wrench-clock.svg"/> Production &amp; Release</h3><p>In parallel to the engineering, a manufacturing partner must be found that will produce and distribute the Ashet Home Computer.</p><p>One of the goals is to make the computer available for 250€ or less, but if that’s possible depends on so many details that it’s hard to tell in the current phase.</p><p>No matter what’s the outcome of this phase, the whole computer design will be available for free under a <em>permissive licence</em> and can be built by everyone.</p></div></div>
