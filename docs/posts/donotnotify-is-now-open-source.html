      <h2>Why Open Source?</h2>
      <p>
        DoNotNotify was built with a strong commitment to privacy. By open sourcing the app, we&#39;re backing
        that commitment with full transparency. You no longer have to take our word for it — you can verify
        for yourself that the app does exactly what it says and nothing more.
