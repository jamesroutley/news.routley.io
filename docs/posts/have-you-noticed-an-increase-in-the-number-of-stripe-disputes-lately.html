    <h1>Ask HN: Have you noticed an increase in the number of Stripe Disputes lately?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>I work on a SaaS app in France. In the past few days we noticed an enormous increase of disputes in our Stripe account, all of them are linked to SEPA payment method (wire).</p><p>We used to have 1 every month of so, now we have had around 7 in 2 days.</p><p>[EDIT] - I received an email from Stripe a few minutes after I submitted this post on HN. It seems there has been an issue with the management of SEPA payments between end of september and start of october.</p><p>[EDIT 2] - I actually received the email before submitting this post, I just did not notice it ;)</p></div></div></div>
