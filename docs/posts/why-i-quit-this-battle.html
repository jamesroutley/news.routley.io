    <h1>Why I quit this battle</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<p><i><b><SPAN size="7" face="Arial">Why I quit this battle</SPAN></b></i></p>

<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">First i want to thank EVERYONE 
who helped knock Intel out of the world domination of cable boxes. Lots of 
people from DSLR deserve to really feel good they battled and won the good 
fight.</SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">I met a lot of great people 
along the way, got to do a 6 hr deposition with Arris in the class action, and 
changed the world for home modem performance as now MSOs/ISPs and CPE makers 
TEST performance of devices using the same tools I used to do high temporal rate 
charting with Pingplotter. CableLabs started focusing on latency. DOCSIS 4 is 
quite mindful of latency. The class action showed the industry that people are 
watching and they will be held accountable. The class action is not settled yet 
and could set precedent for what level of performance is considered defective. I 
learned how to submit CVEs. I learned how to work with PSIRTs and report 
security vulnerabilities. I worked with gov agencies to force Intel into a CVE 
disclosure.. It was a really awesome accomplishment overall..</SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">I had a LOT of help 
technically, and without everyone on DSLR I would have never isolated the issue 
as a exact firmware bug.</SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">THANK YOU TO ALL MY FRIENDS ON 
DSLR - It was awesome</SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">I sent zillions of emails, did 
insane number of posts, set up labs,  did testing. For a year I did nothing 
else. My time away from work was nothing but this. For a year.</SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">No one helped me with the 
pushing the issues thru. Mackey on DSLR was really awesome and worked with Intel 
for the Bug Bounty.</SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">It was me or it was going to 
fail without press coverage, sending emails to the right people.. I dug in hard 
and fought harder.. </SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">Then it was pretty much won,, 
Intel threw in the towel..</SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">We won when Intel sold the 
Connected Home Division.</SPAN></b></p>

<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">I was finished.</SPAN></b></p>

<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">But recently a far more 
insideous problem appeared. Far more difficult to deal with.
<a target="_top" href="https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7133-beyond_your_cable_modem">
<SPAN color="#FFFFFF">The Admin network issue. </SPAN></a>Biggest security risk 
I have ever seen. So I dug in again, started down the path. Got the press 
involved. Found Alex from the video and he agreed to help in the quest :)  
BUT.. I was staring at a year of no longer having free time. Maybe multiple 
years. Fighting a fight 10 times worse. I tried to get others involved in the 
fight. The only one was Alex who joined and did stuff. SO it was me alone.. 
Again.. facing a multiyear battle where I loose all my free time.</SPAN></b></p>

<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">Then,, KevinDS on DSLReports 
was just a incredible ass to me. It was epic. I believe he also lied to me in PM 
when i tried to get him to help. I was already unhappy with the future that I 
was looking at.
<a target="_top" href="https://www.dslreports.com/forum/r31122204-SB6190-Puma6-TCP-UDP-Network-Latency-Issue-Discussion~start=10064">
<SPAN color="#FFFFFF">He then just said nasty things. I was done. </SPAN></a>It 
would be a thankless battle I would wage on my own and I was unwilling because 
of people like him. So KevinDS take a bow. CableLabs loves you, Intel loves you, 
Arris loves you.. I was a huge thorn in thier side. The Badmodems.com site gets 
700 uniqui IPs a day. 380,000 unique since the start. 16 million hits. So 
KevinDS, you pushed me enough at the right time to end all this. I will NOT 
spend the next 5 years in a new battle that is thankless and filled with people 
like you.</SPAN></b></p>

<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">SO I AM VERY SORRY TO ALL MY 
FRIENDS ON DSLR. I HAVE FAILED IN THIS NEW QUEST. I am NOT changing my mind.</SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">There is still hope. The press 
is still pursuing the Admin network issue.</SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">&gt;&gt; YOU &lt;&lt; need to dig in and 
fight</SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">I pulled badmodems because I 
feel I did all this work over a LONG time and no one cares.</SPAN></b></p>
<p><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="4">As childish as it might be, I 
am taking my toys and leaving. Badmodems.com is worth something, so, with 
medical expenses in front of me, its time to cash it in and at least have 
something to show for 4 years of work...</SPAN></b></p>

<p><i><b><SPAN face="Arial" size="6">I am sorry to everyone I let 
down..</SPAN></b></i></p>
