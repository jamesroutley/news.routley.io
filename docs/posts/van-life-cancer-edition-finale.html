“I regret to announce — this is The End. I am going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell.”

Things were going so well. I was all but declaring myself immortal when things changed. A routine scan showed cancer was well and truly kicking my arse, and once again, I was forced to plan for a death at the end of April. 

My flight to [undisclosed sensible European country] has been booked for 19 April, and all that remains is to say my goodbyes.</p>

                            <p itemprop="description">I’ve started to cough up blood (never good) and my mind is failing me. I want to die on my own terms, which is why I’ve chosen to go to [undisclosed sensible European country] whilst I still have the capacity to make my own choice. With my speech and memory going, it’s already difficult to persuade doctors that I’m sufficiently “with it” to understand the gravity of what I’m doing. You can all rest assured that I do understand, and it’s entirely my own choice. I’ve been necessarily reluctant to tell loved ones too much about this final journey, for fear they’ll be prosecuted back in England. So, I am dying on my own.</p>

I’ve felt more alive in the last 6 months than I had in the previous 6 years. It’s all about perspective. Light will trump darkness every time, given the right tools. In my case, my tools were an incurable sense of humour, and, well, you guys.</p>

That silly old bear sure did know a thing or two about living your best life, but my guy Eeyore came up with the best quote of all: “it never hurts to keep looking for sunshine.”
I’ve tried so hard to do that, no matter what shite has been thrown at me. Boredom makes you count every second, whilst terminal illness makes every second count. Fill your life with as much passion and wonder as you can muster. Also remember that cancer is not the only terminal illness: fear, poverty, addiction, loneliness. They are all just a lethal as my cancer. Look out for each other, when you can.</p>

                            <p itemprop="description">A wise man once said, disease intensifies narcissism, especially if it is terminal. Interpreting that as advice rather than critique, I’d like to be self-indulgent for a moment, and share what I hoped my life would be. I trained as lawyer, and had wanted to go into human rights. Things don’t always turn out the way you expect, and I ended up in corporate law, living a lifestyle unworthy of myself, and making the world worse year on year. On a dark day, I sometimes wonder if this is the universe’s way of balancing the wrong I did. I tried my best to be a good and kind person, but ultimately, I know my job was one that made rich motherfuckers even richer. I’m sorry.</p>
