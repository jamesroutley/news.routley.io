        <section>
            <p>Last week, NIST published the final version of the ML-KEM specification, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/203/final?ref=words.filippo.io">FIPS 203</a>. One change from the draft is that the final document explicitly allows storing the private decapsulation key as a <em>seed</em>. This is a plea to the cryptography engineering community: let‚Äôs all agree to only use seeds as the storage format of ML-KEM keys, and forget that a serialized format for expanded decapsulation keys even exists.</p>
<p>Seeds have multiple advantages. The most obvious is size: a seed is 64 bytes, while an expanded decapsulation key is 1 632, 2 400, or 3 168 bytes depending on the ML-KEM parameter set.</p>
<p>More importantly, though, a 64-byte seed is always valid, while an expanded decapsulation key needs to be <em>validated</em>. FIPS 203, Section 7.3, requires the following check</p>
<pre><code>H(dk[384ùëò : 768ùëò + 32])) == dk[768ùëò + 32 : 768ùëò + 64]
</code></pre>
<p>to ensure two parts of the input key are consistent: the pre-computed hash of the encapsulation key, and the encapsulation key itself.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs not all, though. The decapsulation key expanded format is</p>
<pre><code>ByteEncode‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ(s) || ByteEncode‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ(t) || œÅ || H(ekPKE) || z
</code></pre>
<p>where <em>s</em> and <em>t</em> are vectors of <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/kyber-math/">NTT elements</a>. An NTT element is in turn a vector of field elements, and a field element is a number between zero and 3 329, encoded as a 16-bit integer. What if an encoded field element is higher than 3 329? It‚Äôs invalid! What then? Well. If you find one in an <em>encapsulation key</em> you are required to reject it by FIPS 203, Section 7.2. But what if you find it in the encapsulation key that‚Äôs part of a decapsulation key (the <em>t</em> value)? And what if you find it in a different part of a decapsulation key (the <em>s</em> value)? The spec doesn‚Äôt say!</p>
<p>This whole can of worms just stays on the shelf with seeds, because it‚Äôs the implementation itself that derives <em>s</em>, <em>t</em>, and <em>H(ekPKE)</em>, so it can be certain they are valid.</p>
<p>Ok, so seeds are smaller and simpler, reducing the margin for error, but are they expensive? They are not, to the point that loading the expanded decapsulation key over a Gigabit link is almost as expensive as expanding a seed, but most importantly it doesn‚Äôt matter!</p>
<p>Keys have implicitly two representations: one on the wire, one in memory. The latter can include precomputed values to enable faster operations and doesn&#39;t need a fixed bytes format. The cost of going from one to the other‚Äîthe cost of seed expansion‚Äîis not important for private keys: either keys are ephemeral, in which case they can go straight into the in-memory representation, or they are reused a lot, in which case the deserialization cost is amortized.</p>
<p>The ML-KEM expanded decapsulation key format is actually not even a good in-memory format, because it doesn‚Äôt include the full expanded matrix A but its seed œÅ. It‚Äôs a weird in-between where some values are expanded (so you need to validate them) but some others are not (so you need to expand them).</p>
<p>Seeds have obvious advantages and are explicitly allowed by the specification, so we‚Äôll definitely see them used in the wild. If we <em>also</em> support the expanded format, we‚Äôre going to see interoperability issues, and we‚Äôll have to carry all the complexity of both code paths. Let‚Äôs just not.</p>
<p>Speaking of interoperability, FIPS 203 does a great job of specifying everything in terms of byte sequences‚Ä¶ <em>except</em> the seed, which is defined as <em>‚Äå(d, z)</em>. I think every implementation I‚Äôve seen just stores them by concatenating  them as a 64-byte buffer, so hopefully we can all agree on that. If anyone suggests an ASN.1 SEQUENCE of BIT STRINGs or whatever I <em>will</em> quit.</p>
<p><s>To really put this to rest, we‚Äôre going to need (sooner rather than later!) a specification like <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8410?ref=words.filippo.io">RFC 8410</a> which specifies the key format and assigns OIDs for use in e.g. PKCS #8. Interestingly, the OID arc used by RFC 8410 for Ed25519, 1.3.101, is now <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/smi-numbers/smi-numbers.xhtml?ref=words.filippo.io#smi-numbers-1.3.101">managed as an IANA registry</a> with policy <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8126?ref=words.filippo.io#section-4.6">Specification Required</a>, <em>not</em> RFC Required. See <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8411?ref=words.filippo.io">RFC 8411</a>. That means that anyone could make e.g. a <a href="https://c2sp.org/?ref=words.filippo.io">C2SP</a> document referencing FIPS 203 and request OID assignments for ML-KEM. Unless work is already underway to assign OIDs, this might very well be the fastest path, and the longer we wait the more we risk ecosystem fractures.</s></p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> (minutes after pressing send): Well, scratch all that, I was a day behind on my mailing lists inbox and I just saw that NIST has published <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/computer-security-objects-register/algorithm-registration?ref=words.filippo.io">OIDs for all ML-KEM parameters</a> and linked to <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates-03.html?ref=words.filippo.io">draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates-03</a> for the key format specification. The &#34;Private Key Format&#34; section of that draft doesn&#39;t say what the actual private key format is, and hopefully it will land on 64-byte seeds.</p>
<p>Concretely, for implementations, I am suggesting not implementing expanded key parsing and validation at all, or relegating it to an internal function like the <a href="https://words.filippo.io/dispatches/avoid-the-randomness-from-the-sky/">derandomized</a> variants, not exposed in the public API. That‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/mlkem768/compare/55afeac9504dbb4df06844821b0a33ad8c301879...859a9b3f2ff665591a5b659d55aaf0b4111dc171?ref=words.filippo.io">what I did for filippo.io/mlkem768</a> and probably what we will do for the Go standard library. We will also ensure that the test vectors in <a href="https://c2sp.org/CCTV/ML-KEM?ref=words.filippo.io">CCTV</a> and <a href="https://github.com/C2SP/wycheproof?ref=words.filippo.io">Wycheproof</a> don‚Äôt require it (i.e. that they provide seeds as inputs). This will make it hard or impossible to test issues that require malformed decapsulation keys <em>but that‚Äôs the point</em>: if you don‚Äôt expose the API you don‚Äôt need to test its failure cases. All other vectors should be reproducible by bruteforcing seeds.</p>
