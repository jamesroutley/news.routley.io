    <h1>Recent Apple Updates Leading to WiFi Issues</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is Apple’s AWDL Interface?</h3><p>AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link) is a low latency/high speed WiFi for peer-to-peer connection. macOS Yosemite and above utilizes AWDL to handle data transfers to other AWDL-enabled devices (Macs, Macbooks, iPhones, etc.) over the WiFi Radio, without the need for a common underlying Access Point.</p><p>However, whenever AWDL is active (Bonjour discovery and any Airdrop, Airplay, and GameKit links and transfers), it will lock the WiFi radio for small intervals. For Bonjour discovery specifically, this comes to an effective packet spooling time of about 50-100ms, once per second (active transfers will be higher). This will create latency spikes and for some applications, this latency is unacceptable.</p><p>This functionality is causing severe WiFi issues on M1/M2 Macbook Pros.</p><h3>Why is this happening now? </h3><p>The timing of these emergent issues seem to correlate closely with recent MacOS and iOS security updates on October 24th and November 9th. We strongly recommend you move ahead to turn off AWDL on your devices. Folks we’ve advised to turn off awdl0 interface have seen immediate and dramatic improvements in performance. This is an interim solution recommended by Apple until they release a fix. We are currently testing performance with Apple&#39;s Ventura beta launch and will report back as soon as we have any information about a more permanent fix.</p><h3>Why isn&#39;t this happening at my home? </h3><p>Unlike at home, in a commercial (office, warehouse, lab) environment there are many more demands placed on a Mac device’s WiFi radio as it is getting many more passive connection requests from other devices using the AWDL protocol. The more Apple devices you have on a network, the worse this issue gets.</p><h3>When this is over how do I turn AWDL back on?</h3><p>Currently, we do not have an ETA from Apple on when this issue will be resolved on their end. However, once we have word the issue is resolved we would recommend running the command below in your Terminal application. This will stop our initial work-around from running and allow the awdl0 interface to turn back on.</p></div><div><div><p><span>sudo</span> pkill -f /tmp/disable_awdl.sh; <span>sudo</span> ifconfig awdl0 up</p></div></div><p>We will send communication once we hear from Apple about the resolution.</p></div>
