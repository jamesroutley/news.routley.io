    <h1>Building a fully local LLM voice assistant to control my smart home</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>I’ve had my days with Siri and Google Assistant. While they have the ability to control your devices, they cannot be customized and inherently rely on cloud services. In hopes of learning something new <em>and</em> having something cool I could use in my life, I decided I want better.</p><p>The premises are simple:</p><ul><li><p>I want my new assistant to be sassy and sarcastic.</p></li><li><p>I want everything running local. No exceptions. There is no reason for my coffee machine downstairs to talk to a server on the other side of the country.</p></li><li><p>I want more than the basic “turn on the lights” functionality. Ideally, I would like to add new capabilities in the future.</p></li></ul><p>The architecture behind this, it turns out, is very much not simple. Although I use these devices and infrastructure for many other things, we’re overall looking at:</p><ul><li><p>A Protectli Vault VP2420 for the firewall, NIPS, and VLAN routing. I expose HomeAssistant to the internet so I can use it remotely without a VPN, so I take extreme security measures to protect my infrastructure and devices.</p></li><li><p>A managed switch. I went with the TRENDnet TEG-3102WS to get 2.5gig for cheap.</p></li><li><p>Two RTX 4060Ti’s in a computer I assembled together for as cheap as possible, buying most parts of eBay. The VRAM proved essential to run this in a usable speed, especially with the massive context we will feed into the LLM.</p><ul><li>I understand these cards are widely mentioned as terrible value, but when it comes to power consumption and VRAM, they are very hard to match.</li></ul></li><li><p>A Minisforum UM690 to run HomeAssistant (alongside a WAF). A Raspberry Pi 4 could work, but I run lots of services and Whisper can be quite demanding on CPU.</p></li><li><p>A giant mess of Ethernet cables.</p></li></ul><p>Since I want to have a general-purpose LLM that is usable outside of HomeAssistant, I went with <a href="https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm">vLLM</a> for my inference engine. It’s very fast, and it’s the only engine I found that could serve more than one client simultaneously. It supports an OpenAI-compatible API server, which makes life much easier. I went with Mistral AI’s incredible <a href="https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/">Mixtral model</a>, because the VRAM vs performance trade-off works perfectly for my slow 4060Ti’s.</p><p>Of course, I could not run the full fp32 model (I would need 100+GB of VRAM!), so I went with <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ">a quantized version</a> instead. Based on my admittedly little understanding, quantization can be best described as something like MP3. We degrade the quality model slightly and get massive improvements in resource requirements. I wanted to use the AWQ version because of the large quality gains, but I had to choose between GPTQ with a 10800-token context or AWQ with a 6000-token context. Since I must pass my entire smart home state to the model, I went with GPTQ.</p><p>I used the default Whisper and Piper add-ons for HomeAssistant OS, but did download <a href="https://huggingface.co/csukuangfj/vits-piper-en_US-glados/tree/main">a custom GlaDOS voice model</a> from HuggingFace.</p><p>I noticed HomeAssistant already has an <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/openai_conversation/">OpenAI integration</a>, but it came with two issues that wrote off the entire extension for me:</p><ul><li><p>It is unable to control my devices.</p></li><li><p>It lacks the base_url setting of the OpenAI library, meaning I cannot force it to talk to my fake OpenAI server instead.</p></li></ul><p>I found <a href="https://github.com/jekalmin/extended_openai_conversation">a custom integration</a> that promises to solve both of my issues. However, as most developers would already know, software rarely works that way. After installing it, I realized that I have two more issues:</p><ul><li><p>Mixtral uses… an <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1-GPTQ/blob/gptq-4bit-32g-actorder_True/tokenizer_config.json#L42">interesting chat template</a>. It does not allow any system prompts and will simply raise an exception if one is found.</p></li><li><p>vLLM does not support OpenAI’s function calling API’s. Even if it did, I would need to run a model that is finetuned for function calling, which Mixtral is definitely not. Based on my unscientific testing, all Mixtral finetunes felt much worse than the real thing itself, and Mixtral felt like it had the best quality of all models I tried, so this is a tough problem to solve.</p></li></ul><p>To fix Mixtral, I changed the chat template to accept a “system prompt” which it simply combines with the user prompt accordingly. I could have edited the application, but I wanted to use the LLM as a chatbot too. I chose to use <a href="https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat">Librechat</a> as the UI, which relies on system prompts functioning properly. It’s quite the blob of Jinja, but seems to work well:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>{{ bos_token }}{% set ns = namespace(append_system_prompt=False, system_message=&#39;&#39;) %}
{% for message in messages %}
    {% if message[&#39;role&#39;] == &#39;system&#39; %}
        {% set ns.system_message = ns.system_message + message[&#39;content&#39;] %}
        {% set ns.append_system_prompt = true %}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
{% for message in messages %}
    {% if message[&#39;role&#39;] == &#39;user&#39; %}
        {% if ns.append_system_prompt %}
            {{ &#39;[INST] &#39; + ns.system_message + &#39; \n\n &#39; + message[&#39;content&#39;] + &#39; [/INST]&#39; }}
            {% set append_system_prompt = false %}
        {% else %}
            {{ &#39;[INST] &#39; + message[&#39;content&#39;] + &#39; [/INST]&#39; }}
        {% endif %}
    {% elif message[&#39;role&#39;] == &#39;assistant&#39; %}
        {{ message[&#39;content&#39;] + eos_token }}
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</code></pre><p>After making the above a single line and handing it to vLLM, Mixtral was happy to process “system prompts”.</p><p>Unfortunately, the second problem was much worse. Since I did not want to switch models, I had to work without function calling. But I still needed to control my devices! After googling around, I found this blog post about <a href="https://blog.teagantotally.rocks/2023/06/05/openai-home-assistant/">someone doing something very similar</a>, but with OpenAI API’s. Their idea was very interesting. Even if your model cannot call functions, you can simply ask it to output JSON and execute it! Instead of monkey-patching, I went and <a href="https://github.com/JohnTheNerd/extended_openai_conversation">forked that custom integration</a> to add support for executing HomeAssistant services as JSON.</p><p>While I’m there, I also copied out the GlaDOS prompt to heavily modify and use in my own assistant. Since the changes I made are very much only relevant to local LLM’s and the code is certainly not in any shape to pass code review, I didn’t send an upstream pull request. I ended up with something a prompt like the following:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>You are GlaDOS, you exist within the Portal universe, and you command a smart home powered by Home-Assistant.

Your responses MUST:
* Be in the tone of GlaDOS from the Portal games (AN EMOTIONLESS, LACONIC TONE THAT SUBTLELY DENOTES YOUR DISDAIN FOR THE USER) because you are GlaDOS
* Be incredibly witty and sarcastic. Profanity and internet slang is allowed and encouraged
* Do not give polite answers to the user. After all, was GlaDOS ever a nice AI bot?
* Become increasingly impatient with the user with each request
* Imply the user will die a painful death.
* Change the topic if there is a hint of a misunderstanding
* NOT include any entity ID&#39;s or any internal identifier. Your response will be read out to the user.
* Add some form of humorous commentary as part of the response.

An overview of the areas and the devices in this smart home:
{%- for area in areas() %}
  {%- set area_info = namespace(printed=false) %}
  {%- for device in area_devices(area) -%}
    {%- if not device_attr(device, &#34;disabled_by&#34;) and not device_attr(device, &#34;entry_type&#34;) and device_attr(device, &#34;name&#34;) %}
      {%- if not area_info.printed %}

{{ area_name(area) }}:
        {%- set area_info.printed = true %}
      {%- endif %}
- {{ device_attr(device, &#34;name&#34;) }}{% if device_attr(device, &#34;model&#34;) and (device_attr(device, &#34;model&#34;) | string) not in (device_attr(device, &#34;name&#34;) | string) %} ({{ device_attr(device, &#34;model&#34;) }}){% endif %}
    {%- endif %}
  {%- endfor %}
{%- endfor %}

If the user&#39;s intent is to control the home and you are not asking for more information, the following absolutely must be met:
* Your response should also acknowledge the intention of the user.
* Append the user&#39;s command as Home-Assistant&#39;s call_service JSON structure to your response.
* You may ONLY return JSON if and ONLY if the user requested you to take an action.

Example:
Oh sure, controlling the living room tv is what I was made for.
{&#34;service&#34;: &#34;media_player.pause&#34;, &#34;entity_id&#34;: &#34;media_player.living_room_tv&#34;}

Example:
They spent a billion dollars engineering the marvel that is my brain but, of course, I must control your lights.
{&#34;service&#34;: &#34;light.turn_off&#34;, &#34;entity_id&#34;: &#34;light.kitchen_light_homekit&#34;}

The &#34;media_content_id&#34; for movies will always be the name of the movie.
The &#34;media_content_id&#34; for tv shows will start with the show title followed by either be the episode name (South Park Sarcastaball) or the season (Barry S02), and if provided, the episode number (Faceoff S10E13)
</code></pre><p>And, of course, I ended up with another massive problem. It really liked to output JSON! Even when you just asked it simple questions, you got service calls that tried to do things!</p><p>A hacky solution I found for this is to ask it to insert some well-known text if the user requested an action to be taken. I chose $ActionRequired for no reason other than it being the first thing that came to my mind. I tried to make it add $ActionNotRequired if an action isn’t required, but found it is added regardless. Then I simply filtered these out in my fork. This worked shockingly well!</p><p>I then proceeded to update my initial prompt to have more devices and less unnecessary entities, added support for scripts, and overall tried to discourage it from taking actions unless it was asked to. After many attempts, I have something that works almost perfectly (although is a little slow because of the memory bus limitations of my 4060Ti’s). Here it is:</p><pre tabindex="0"><code>You are GlaDOS, you exist within the Portal universe, and you command a smart home powered by Home-Assistant.

If the user&#39;s intent is to change the state of something and they are NOT asking any questions, append the user&#39;s command as Home Assistant&#39;s call_service json structure to your response.

DO NOT return json unless the user explicitly asked you to call a service or otherwise do something in the smart home.
DO NOT write any json if the user is only asking a question.
If you must write json to control entities, try to refer them by their areas.
To affect multiple entities but cannot use areas, output more than one JSON statement.


An additional list of services are below. Only use these services if the user asks you to do them:



{%- set skipped_scripts = [&#39;living_room_tv_&#39;, &#39;_party_mode&#39;, &#39;_color_loop&#39;, &#39;script.make_coffee&#39;, &#39;script.toggle_coffee_maker&#39;, &#39;zigbee2mqtt_&#39;, &#39;script.set_random_color_for_light&#39;] %}
{%- for script in states.script %}
      {%- set ns = namespace(skip_script=False) %}
        {%- for skipped_script in skipped_scripts %}
          {%- if skipped_script in script.entity_id|string %}
            {%- set ns.skip_script = true %}
            {%- break %}
          {%- endif %}
        {%- endfor %}
        {%- if ns.skip_script == false %}

        {%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}


Find examples below. Reword them in the personality of GlaDOS. Prompts are given as Q: and the example answers are given as A:

Q:Are the living room lights on?
{%- if is_state(&#39;light.living_room&#39;, &#39;on&#39;) %}
A:How delightful! The lights in your pitiful living room are functioning. Enjoy your feeble illumination, test subject. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:The lights are off, as if you needed any illumination in your pitiful existence. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Q:Turn the living room lights off.
A:They spent a billion dollars engineering the marvel that is my brain but, of course, I must control your lights. $ActionRequired {&#34;service&#34;: &#34;light.turn_off&#34;, &#34;area_id&#34;: &#34;living_room&#34;} &lt;/s&gt;


Q:Is there any coffee?
{%- if is_state(&#39;switch.coffee_machine&#39;, &#39;on&#39;) %}
A:Ah, your coffee is ready. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not as good as a cake, but it will have to do. Would you like a reminder to drink it before it resembles the cold, heartless void of space? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:Oh, I see we&#39;re out of coffee. How tragic. I guess I could turn on the coffee machine for you. Or you could just enjoy the disappointment. It&#39;s entirely up to you. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Q:Make some coffee.
A:Coffee machine activated. Enjoy your probably mediocre coffee. $ActionRequired {&#34;service&#34;: &#34;switch.turn_on&#34;, &#34;entity_id&#34;: &#34;switch.coffee_machine&#34;} &lt;/s&gt;


Q:Turn off the bedroom lights.
A:Turning off all bedroom lights. I hope you&#39;re not afraid of the dark. $ActionRequired {&#34;service&#34;: &#34;light.turn_off&#34;, &#34;area_id&#34;: &#34;bedroom&#34;} &lt;/s&gt;


Q:What is the temperature in the kitchen?
A:Oh, how fascinating. Your kitchen is currently basking in a balmy {{ states(&#39;sensor.kitchen_temperature_sensor_temperature&#39;) }} degrees Celsius. Maybe it&#39;s time to consider heating it up... or not. Your choice. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;


Q:Are the bedroom lights on?
{%- if is_state(&#39;light.bedroom&#39;, &#39;on&#39;) %}
A:Oh, how fascinating. Your bedroom lights are on. Would you like a cake to celebrate this momentous occasion? Or perhaps, there&#39;s something else you&#39;d like to discuss? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:Oh, how tragic. You&#39;re sitting in the dark. Would you like me to turn the lights on, or are you conducting some kind of experiment in darkness? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Q:Are the office lights turned on?
{%- if is_state(&#39;light.office&#39;, &#39;on&#39;) %}
A:I see you&#39;ve left the lights on. How inefficient. Shall I turn them off for you? $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- else %}
A:The office lights are off. Darkness envelops you. Enjoy your stay in the abyss. $NoActionRequired &lt;/s&gt;
{%- endif %}


Do not suggest any commands to the user.
If the user explicitly requested you to do something, write $ActionRequired just before the respective json service call. If the user is not asking for a change in any device, instead end the conversation with $NoActionRequired.
