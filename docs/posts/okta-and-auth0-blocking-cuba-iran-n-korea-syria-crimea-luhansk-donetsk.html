<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Why are we blocking Users from access to Okta Service?</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>In support of our customers’ and Okta’s existing contractual obligations with respect to U.S. export control laws, Okta customers are not permitted to access the Okta Service (including the Auth0 Platform) from Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, the regions of Crimea, Luhansk or Donetsk without prior approval from the U.S. Government. This restriction applies even if a User is temporarily visiting any of the aforementioned regions. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>When are we blocking Users from access to Okta Service, including the Auth0 Platform?</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Okta will begin blocking users starting on October 3, 2022 in Preview cells and starting on October 17, 2022 in Production cells and should complete in approximately two weeks.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>  The following </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>federally authorized cells</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span> are not included in the above schedule: OK5, OK10, OK15, OG1 and OM1.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Okta will be disabling the ability for any Users to access the Auth0 Platform from the aforementioned regions starting on October 17, 2022.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Why are we taking technical measures now to block Users from access to Okta Service, including the Auth0 Platform?</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

We are taking this action to </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>strengthen our customers’ and Okta’s existing, contractual responsibilities to remain in compliance with certain U.S. export control restrictions.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As a Customer, you are responsible for ensuring your own compliance with applicable laws. As outlined in the Okta </span></span></span></span></span></span></span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.okta.com/agreements/"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Master Subscription Agreement</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>, you must use the Okta Service in compliance with applicable laws. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>You are responsible for choosing your own Okta or Auth0 regions for deploying your tenant and ensuring that your configuration meets relevant requirements. Okta does not inspect, approve, or monitor the tenants or applications you deploy on the Okta Service (including the Auth0 Platform).  </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>What diligence does Okta conduct?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>For Customer purchases, Okta conducts diligence to prevent certain purchases from organizations located within OFAC-embargoed countries. However, it is your responsibility to prevent access to your application and transactions by involving your applications deployed on the Okta Service (including the Auth0 Platform). Okta does not block network traffic to your website. Even though OFAC explains that companies can restrict access based on IP table range, it does not necessarily address all compliance risks. Okta has no responsibility for and does not have the ability to know directly the end users that interact with your applications using the Okta Service (including the Auth0 Platform).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>What if I have a User or Users that are traveling to these regions?  How can I ensure that they continue to have access to Okta, Auth0, and related applications?</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>We have an exemption process to allow for those Users to maintain access to their Okta managed org or Auth0 tenant, if such access is authorized pursuant to a license from OFAC.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>What is the process to receive an exemption if I am legally permitted and subscribe to the Okta Service?</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customers can receive a temporary exemption by contacting us at </span></span></span></span></span></span><a target="_blank" href="mailto:CSEevents@okta.com"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>CSEevents@okta.com</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span><span><span>. You will be required to complete a questionnaire to identify whether you are eligible to access the Okta Service from an embargoed territory. Please allow up to five business days for your request to be completed.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>What are some examples of valid exemption requests?  </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>A valid exemption request will only be granted for those entities that have a license from OFAC to engage in a transaction that otherwise would be prohibited. Customers must make sure that all transactions pursuant to general or specific licenses must strictly observe all conditions of the licenses and in compliance with applicable laws.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
 

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>What is the expected turnaround time needed to grant access?</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customers should expect the processing of the request to take up to five business days from the time they submit their exemption request questionnaire.

<p data-aura-rendered-by="12:303;a"><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you need an extension, you will need to specify the timeline and length in your request based on any exemption permitted to you under OFAC.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
