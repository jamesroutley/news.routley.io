	<p>This year we calculated brand-level score by first examining the weighted overall problem rate for all models within a brand for each model year. Then the brand reliability score was calculated by averaging results from 2021 to 2023, and some early 2024 data for each brand, where there was sufficient sample size. Because this is a change from prior years, we are not identifying whether a brand has moved up or down in relation to last year’s ranking.</p>

            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>Every year CR asks its members about problems they’ve had with their vehicles in the previous 12 months. This year we gathered data on over 330,000 vehicles, from the 2000 to 2023 model years, with a few early-introduced 2024 model years. </p>
<p>We study 20 trouble areas, from nuisances—such as squeaky brakes and broken interior trim—to major bummers, such as potentially expensive out-of-warranty engine, transmission, EV battery, and EV charging problems. We use that information to give reliability ratings for every major mainstream model.</p>
<p>We weigh the severity of each type of problem to create a predicted reliability score for each vehicle, from 1 to 100. We use that information to give reliability ratings for every major mainstream vehicle. (The reliability rating is then combined with data collected from our track testing, as well as our owner satisfaction survey results and safety data, to calculate each test vehicle’s Overall Score.)</p>
<p>This year we have addressed the rapidly growing number of electrified offerings that automakers are producing: hybrids, plug-in hybrids (PHEV), and electric vehicles (EV). As a result, we added three new trouble areas: electric motor, EV/hybrid battery, and EV charging:</p>
<p>• <strong>Internal Combustion Engine (ICE)</strong> vehicles have 17 potential trouble areas.</p>

            <h2>How the Regions Compare for Reliability</h2>
</div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>Asian automakers are still leading reliability by a wide margin with an overall reliability average score of 63 for the region, on a scale of 1 to 100. Seven of the 10 most reliable brands are from Asian automakers. </p>
<p>European automakers are in second place at 46, with three brands filling out the rest of the top 10 most reliable brands. </p>
<p>Domestic brands trail both with an average score of 39. Each domestic automaker had at least one model that had an average or better reliability ranking, and Buick’s entire lineup scored average or better.</p>
<p>Both the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/ford/edge/">Ford Edge</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/ford/maverick/">Maverick</a> scored above-average this year, while the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/buick/encore-gx">Buick Encore GX</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/cadillac/xt5">Cadillac XT5</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/chevrolet/equinox">Chevrolet Equinox</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/gmc/terrain">GMC Terrain</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/lincoln/corsair">Lincoln Corsair</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/tesla/model-3">Tesla Model 3</a> had high scores.</p>
<p>Cars, including sedans, hatchbacks, and wagons, remain the most reliable vehicle type, with an average reliability rating of 57 (on a scale of 0 to 100), followed by SUVs (50) and minivans (45). “Sedans have fallen out of favor with consumers, but as a class they are very reliable,” says Jake Fisher, senior director of <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/cars-driving/how-consumer-reports-tests-cars-auto-test-center-a3516544374/">auto testing at Consumer Reports</a>. “They often have less of the latest technology and features that can cause problems before the bugs are worked out.” Pickup trucks come in last, with an average reliability rating of 41.</p>

            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>There are interesting insights with the reliability of electrified models this year. Overall, hybrids have 26 percent fewer problems than cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE). Some standouts include the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/lexus/ux">Lexus UX</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/lexus/nx-hybrid">NX Hybrid</a> and the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/camry-hybrid">Toyota Camry Hybrid</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/highlander-hybrid">Highlander Hybrid</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/rav4-hybrid">RAV4 Hybrid</a>.</p>
<p>Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are more of a mixed bag. As a category, they have 146 percent more problems than ICE vehicles. Several PHEVs are even less reliable than their conventional counterparts, such as the below-average <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/audi/q5">Audi Q5</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/chrysler/pacifica-hybrid">Chrysler Pacifica</a>. The latter has the lowest score in our survey, at 14.</p>
<p>Still, there are PHEVs that buck that trend, including standouts such as the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/rav4-prime">Toyota RAV4 Prime</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/kia/sportage-hybrid">Kia Sportage</a>, which score well above average. The <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/bmw/x5">BMW X5</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hyundai/tucson-hybrid">Hyundai Tucson</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/ford/escape-hybrid">Ford Escape</a> PHEVs earn average reliability scores.</p>

                <p>Electric cars and electric SUVs don’t fare much better, with average reliability scores of 44 and 43, respectively. At the bottom of our vehicle-type rankings are electric pickup trucks, with an average score of 30.</p>
<p>As more EVs hit the marketplace and automakers build each model in greater numbers, we are seeing that some of them have problems with the EV drive system motors, EV charging systems, and EV batteries (which are different from the low-power 12-volt batteries that power accessories). Owners of the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/ford/f-150-lightning">Ford F-150 Lightning</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/ford/mustang-mach-e">Mustang Mach-E</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/genesis/gv60">Genesis GV60</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/hyundai/ioniq-5">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/kia/niro-electric">Kia Niro EV</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/kia/ev6">EV6</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/subaru/solterra">Subaru Solterra</a>, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/bz4x">Toyota bZ4X</a>, and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/volkswagen/id4">Volkswagen ID.4</a> all reported some of these issues.</p>
<p>Among the top five brands, Lexus has just one model, the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/lexus/nx/">NX</a>, that scored average predicted reliability. All of its other models scored above-average or better reliability this year, led by the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/lexus/ux/">UX</a> hybrid SUV.</p>
<p>A majority of Toyota models have above- or well-above-average reliability. The brand is topped by the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/4runner">4Runner</a> SUV, which is among the most reliable models in the survey. But the brand’s full-sized pickup truck, the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/toyota/tundra/">Tundra</a>, remains among the less reliable vehicles in the survey.</p>
<p>Acura’s RDX and TLX both have above-average reliability, while the brand’s two recently redesigned models, the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/acura/mdx/">MDX</a> SUV and Integra sedan, come in at average. </p>
<p>Consumer Reports’ brand-level rankings are based on the average predicted reliability score for vehicles in the brand’s model lineup.</p>
<p>Here we present the rankings of brands based on their average reliability scores. We identify the most and least reliable model scores within each brand and list whether the brand’s rank went up or down based on their relative position from our last survey. This means we consider only those brands in both surveys that had sufficient data for two or more models.</p>
