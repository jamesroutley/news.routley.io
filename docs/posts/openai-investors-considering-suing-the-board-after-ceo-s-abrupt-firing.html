It was not immediately clear if these investors will sue OpenAI.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Investors worry that they could lose hundreds of millions of dollars they invested in OpenAI, a crown jewel in some of their portfolios, with the potential collapse of the hottest startup in the rapidly growing generative AI sector.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-3">OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Microsoft <a data-testid="Link" href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">(MSFT.O)</a> owns 49% of the for-profit operating company, according to sources familiar with the matter. Other investors and employees control 49%, with 2% owned by OpenAI&#39;s nonprofit parent, according to Semafor.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">OpenAI&#39;s board fired Altman on Friday after a &#34;breakdown of communications,&#34; according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">By Monday, most of OpenAI&#39;s more than 700 employees <a data-testid="Link" href="https://isakfalk.com/technology/openai-execs-invite-altman-brockman-headquarters-sunday-the-information-2023-11-19/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade">threatened to resign</a> unless the company replaced the board.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Venture capital investors usually hold board seats or voting power in their portfolio companies but OpenAI is controlled by its nonprofit parent company OpenAI Nonprofit, which according to OpenAI&#39;s website was created to benefit &#34;humanity, not OpenAI investors.&#34;</p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">As a result, employees have more leverage in pressuring the board than the venture capitalists who helped fund the company, said Minor Myers, a law professor at the University of Connecticut. &#34;There is nobody exactly who is in the seat of an injured investor,&#34; he said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">That is a feature, not a bug of OpenAI&#39;s structure, which started out as a nonprofit but added a for-profit subsidiary in 2019 to raise capital. Keeping control of operations let the nonprofit preserve its &#34;core mission, governance, and oversight,&#34; according to the company&#39;s website.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Nonprofit boards have legal obligations to the organizations they oversee. But those obligations, such as the duty to exercise care and avoid self-dealing, leave a lot of leeway for leadership decisions, experts said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">Those obligations can be further narrowed in a corporate structure such as OpenAI, which used a limited liability company as its operating arm, potentially further insulating the nonprofit&#39;s directors from investors, said Paul Weitzel, a law professor at the University of Nebraska.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-12">Even if investors found a way to sue, Weitzel said they would have a &#34;weak case.&#34; Companies have broad latitude under the law to make business decisions, even ones that backfire.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-13">&#34;You can fire visionary founders,&#34; Weitzel said.
