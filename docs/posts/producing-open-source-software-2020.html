    from Open Sourcing Code</a></b> </dt>
<dd><p>As the open source community continues to clamor for more companies
    to open source their code, more and more executives are asking
    themselves just what open source can do for their company. There
    are a number of ways for a company to open source an internal
    project: from tossing code over the wall on the one hand to
    running a fully open development project on the other to any
    combination of the two.  This talk will discuss the costs and
    benefits associated with each method as well as how to
    successfully launch your new open source project.  Given as a
    Google Tech Talk.</p></dd>

    (And You Can Too)</a></b> </dt>
<dd><p>Every open source project runs into people who are selfish,
    uncooperative, and disrespectful.  These people can silently
    poison the atmosphere of a happy developer community.  Come learn
    how to identify these people and peacefully de-fuse them before
    they derail your project.  Told through a series of (often
    amusing) real-life anecdotes and experiences.  Given as a Google
    Tech Talk.</p></dd>
