    <h1>California enacts law enabling people to universally opt out of data sharing</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p> California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday signed a bill which requires web browsers to make it easier for Californians to opt-out of allowing third parties to sell their data. </p><p> The California Consumer Privacy Act, signed in 2018, gave Californians the right to send opt-out signals, but major browsers have not had to make opt-outs simple to use. The bill signed Wednesday would require them to set up an easy-to-find mechanism that lets Californians opt-out with the push of a button, instead of having to do so repeatedly when visiting individual websites. </p><p> Privacy and consumer rights activists have been nervously waiting for Newsom to sign the bill, which <a href="https://therecord.media/california-legislature-passes-bill-data-sharing-opt-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed</a> the California legislature on September 11 and is the first law in the country of its kind. The governor had vetoed a similar but broader bill last year which also applied to mobile operating systems. </p><p> “These signals are going to be available to millions more people and it&#39;s going to be much easier for them to opt out,” said Matt Schwartz, a policy analyst at Consumer Reports. </p><p> Until now, Schwartz said, individuals who want to use a universal opt out have had to download third party browser extensions or use a privacy protective browser. </p><p> Other bills signed by Newsom on Wednesday also give Californians important data privacy rights.  </p><p> One of them requires social media companies to make it easy to cancel accounts and mandates that cancellation lead to full deletion of consumers’ data. A second bolsters the state’s Data Broker Registration Law by giving consumers more information about what personal data is collected by data brokers and who can obtain it. </p></span></p><div><div><p>Get more insights with the </p><p>Recorded Future</p><p>Intelligence Cloud.</p></div><p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/platform?mtm_campaign=ad-unit-record">Learn more.</a></p></div></div>
