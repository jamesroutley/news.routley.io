<h3>2022</h3><p>

2022 Grab Bag:
</p><ul>
<li>Finished my Masters degree (CSE @ UW)!; on top of that, took an Advanced Computer Architecture class &amp; an Electric Grid regulation class from a WA UTC commissioner
</li>
<li>
Two ten-year anniversaries - ten years since my <a href="https://ops101.org/archives/000119.html">4K bike ride</a> from Baltimore to Portland (Chelsea from my year wrote the best <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cg3IlGeM6T5ktNuFWbAB2BXrmx5L8olLb1O9XE0/">retrospective</a>); and ten years since I started working at Google
</li>
<li>Failed to hold a relationship together</li>
<li>
Tens of thousands of miles of EV road-tripping!
</li>
<li>
A week sampling clover at Bodega Marine Lab, overlooking the Pacific Ocean
</li>
<li>Spent a month in a ~new place and state (Taos, NM)</li>
<li>Donated a quarter of my income to climate and Effective Altruism organizations ðŸ˜¬ (<a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LNbzDCgCH2py3cnJv/?commentId=sbrppPvbgL5bLryoJ">details</a>)</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37728027-venkatesh">26 books</a>; top three:
  <ul>
  <li>Warmth, <i>Daniel Sherrell</i> - Talking about &#34;The Problem&#34; (Climate Change) in letters to a future child.
  <p>
  The author, Daniel Sherrell, is from New Jersey, not far from where and when I grew up; he works on climate advocacy in New York State. I found his perspective very relatable - he understands and draws on the technical, but writes the visceral. His evocation of love as fury is pretty powerful and stood out to me among climate writing.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>On Repentance and Repair, <i>Danya Ruttenberg</i> - Thinking about repentance, repair, and reconcilliation through a framework from Maimonides
  <p>
  The framework offered here is fairly different than the one I grew up with - it starts with objective statements of what happened; change to ensure the harm is not repeated; restitution and consequences; apology (delayed all the way to step 4!); and making different choices. As elaborated, it sounds like it would better address harm I have caused; it also seems like it&#39;d be pretty demanding. I particularly appreciated an examination of something I do (apologize) but had never given great thought to.
  </p>
  </li>
  <li>Ducks, <i>Kate Beaton</i></li>
  </ul>
  <br/> 
</li>
<li>
First concert since the pandemic started (Gregory Alan Isakov at the Gorge)
</li>
<li>
Made jam and Ice Cream for the first time!
</li>
<li>
Biked Mt. Constitution, part of the Sea to Sky Highway (BC Hwy 99), and Harvest Century
</li>
<li>
Grew tomatoes, a Sequoia, and potatoes (by mistake!)
</li>
<li>
News story from the year that&#39;s stayed with me - <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/11/28/climate-change-from-a-to-z">Climate Change from A to Z</a>, Elizabeth Kolbert, New Yorker Nov 2022
</li>
</ul>

<p>
It&#39;s been an eventful, rich year. There&#39;s a lot I wish I&#39;d done, a lot I wish I&#39;d done better; but I tried new and hard things and learned from both the successes and failures.
</p>
<p>
See you in 2023!
