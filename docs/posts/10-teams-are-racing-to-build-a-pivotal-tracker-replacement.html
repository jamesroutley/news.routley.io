                  Many people expressed their sadness and love for Pivotal Tracker when the shutdown was announced. Today, as we get closer to the sunset date, we want to remember what made it unique and provide an overview of the projects carrying Tracker&#39;s legacy forward. It&#39;s exciting to witness more than 10 teams from across the globe working to achieve this goal in a condensed time frame. We invite you to follow along and thank Tracker and everyone who worked on it over the years!

                <h3>What is a Project Tracker?</h3>
                <p>
                  Calling Tracker a project management tool doesn&#39;t do it justice. It was great because it deliberately said NO to features that were detrimental to dev teams&#39; productivity and flow. Instead, it focused on developer productivity and happiness while automating everything possible. Let&#39;s call this category &#34;project trackers&#34; to differentiate it from bug trackers (huge databases optimized for ingestion from untrusted sources, filtering, sorting, and triage) and general project management tools (software built for non-technical project managers and executives focusing on status insights and top-down planning).

              <h3>Everyone is on the Same Page</h3>
              <p>A project tracker is where developers and PMs &#34;live&#34; and feel at home. You don&#39;t get lost in complex filter presets or need mental overhead to understand the context of the project setup and workflows. Collaborators can switch projects and immediately know where they are and what state the project is in because there is a shared set of base views everyone knows. Only the minimum amount of custom settings and baked-in best practices are required to make the right things easy and the wrong way harder, thus preventing projects from drifting.</p>

              <li>
                <h3>Auto Planning</h3>
                <p>Cycles are a natural product of the planning process and not something that needs to be manually created, consuming time and effort. Instead, cycles are planned and updated automatically as circumstances evolve, allowing teams to predict when they will reach milestones more accurately. A project tracker removes the pressure placed on developers to answer when something will be done or if a new feature can fit into a sprint. Everyone can see what can be reached by when and discuss if descoping is needed to meet ‘necessary’ deadlines. You do not plan the cycles; the core planning activity is prioritizing the work to be done.</p>
