    <h1>Is it possible for a lunar eclipse to occur before sunset?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Yes, barely.</p>
<p>The atmosphere bends light, especially at rise and set. When the sun appears to be on the horizon, it is actually about a degree below the horizon. This means that when the sun and moon are actually aligned they would both be visible.</p>
<p>You can simulate this in Stellarium (or another planetarium system that simulates atmospheric effects)</p>
<p>Set the time to a MJD of 61102.43689, (2026-03-03 10:29:07 UTC) the location to N 30° 38&#39; 55.14&#34;, E 111° 52&#39; 48.64&#34; and use &#34;Zero Horizon&#34; (rather than the default picture of a field). There will always be some locations at which the moon is rising during an eclipse, so this is quite common. But actual locations on land where both horizons are visible and the air is clear enough to see the moon that low are rare.</p>
<p>This is strictly an atmospheric effect, it wouldn&#39;t be possible if the Earth had no atmosphere.</p>

<p>This was observed by the French astronomer <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Sphere_of_Marcus_Manilius_Made_an_En/KGFDAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=selenelion&amp;pg=RA1-PA107&amp;printsec=frontcover" rel="noreferrer">Antoine-François Payen</a>, described in his 1666 treatise <em>Selenelion ou apparition luni-solaire en l&#39;isle de Gorgonne</em>.  The word &#34;Selenelion&#34; (a portmanteau of Greek selene + helion, ie &#34;moon-sun&#34;) has been occasionally been used in English to describe this phenomenon.</p>
