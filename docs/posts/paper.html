<p>I agree with two things from <em><a href="https://dynomight.net/paper/">Paper</a></em>, recently posted on Dynomight’s blog:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The world needs more mundane blogging. Or maybe I just am attracted to the idea of blogging about things that are a bit less serious as a nice distraction to the current moment.</li>
  <li>Paper is great!</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve been keeping a notebook since ~2020, usually just one at a time which I append-only write journals, notes from meetings, random half-baked ideas, etc.</p>

<p>Like Dynomight, I’ve also grappled with the tension between digital and paper. The former is so searchable and convenient. It feels like my writing is, on a daily basis, alive and actively helping me evolve as a person<sup id="fnref:0" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:0" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. My paper notes do that too, but they’re entirely limited by the friction of rediscovering them. It’s rare that I take my past notebooks down from the shelves and flip through them, though always rewarding when I do.</p>

<p>Despite its inconvenience, it feels so gosh darn good to write on paper. It’s a physical thing in the actual world, not some lights on a black mirror. And it looks so much cooler! Sitting in a coffee shop writing in a Moleskin notebook with a fountain pen is always going to be a better style than sitting there typing into a laptop.</p>

<p>I’ve developed one mechanism for bridging this dilemma: each time I write out some notes, a journal entry, or anything worth preserving in my paper notebook I’ll draw a little square next to it. Whenever I get some free time at home, I’ll open up my notebook and start scanning in/transcribing the handwritten prose into a note in my <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>. I even have little icons I draw for signifying that I want to append to an existing digital note. One I’m done, I check off the square to signal that the note has been ingested.</p>

<p>It’s a tedious task and I’m not always great at following through with it, but it’s rewarding when I do. It offers a chance to reflect on my past writing in a way that I don’t always get if I just read through it. Typing it out word-by-word forces you to pay attention to what you were saying in more detail.</p>
