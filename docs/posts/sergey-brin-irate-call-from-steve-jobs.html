    <h1>Sergey Brin: Irate Call from Steve Jobs</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><div class=""><div><div dir="auto"><p><em>Welcome to Internal Tech Emails: internal tech industry emails that surface in public records. 🔍 If you haven’t signed up, join 20,000+ others and get the free newsletter:</em></p><p><strong>From:</strong><span> Sergey Brin</span></p><p><span>so i got a call from steve jobs today who was very agitated.</span></p><p><span>anyhow, i told him we were not building a browser and that to my knowledge we were not systematically going after the safari team in particular.  and that we should talk about various opportunities.</span></p><p>so i just wanted to check what our status was in various respects and what we want to do about partners/friendly companies and recruiting.  on the browser, i know and told him that we have mozilla people working here ... largely on firefox.  i did not mention we may release an enhanced version but i am not sure we are going to yet.</p><p>on recruiting i have heard recently of one candidate out of apple that had browser expertise so i guess he would be on safari.  i mentioned this to steve and he told me he was cool with us hiring anyone who came to us but was angry about systematic solicitation.  i don&#39;t know if there is some systematic safari recruiting effort htat we have.</p><p><span>so please update me on what you know here and on what you think we should have as policy.</span></p><p><span>--sergey</span></p><p>Ben and I have been working for over 2 months to recruit [REDACTED] from the Safari team.  He is absolutely one of the best in the world at Browser technology.  [REDACTED]  The Mozilla foundation was also trying to hire him.  We finally got him to &#34;come by and talk to a few people&#34; last week.  Carrie is throwing together the world&#39;s shortest resume.  He comes to offer review on Monday, and if we make him that offer, he is likely to accept.  He seemed to care whether the world has an alternative to IE.  I don&#39;t believe that we have contacted anyone else from the Safari team, but I&#39;ll check with Carrie.  I know that wherever [REDACTED] goes, other talented people are likely to follow.</p><p><span>Alan</span></p><p>Quick update on Safari: As Alan mentions below, Ben Goodger, a Google Employee, referred [REDACTED] as well as three other developers from Apple&#39;s Safari team.  We have already contacted two of the leads, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] but have yet to contact [REDACTED].</p><p>[REDACTED] is currently in discussion with both the Mozilla Foundation and a start-up – so he was planning on leaving Apple very soon regardless of our efforts.</p><p><span>We are careful to adhere to non-compete agreements if we have established these with any company.  However, it is the staffing organization&#39;s practice to aggressively pursue leads that come from our employees and bring the best talent onboard.</span></p><p>Sergey</p><p>Steve just called me again and is pissed that we are still recruiting his browser guy. You should give him a call.</p><p><span>Bill</span></p><p>He called a few minutes ago and demanded to talk to me...  where are we at with the candidate?</p><p><span>-L</span></p><p><span>Sergey is going to call him now.</span></p><p>We approved an offer on Monday, and [REDACTED] has it in hand.  He&#39;s certainly to leave Apple, probably to us.  He is waiting to see whether the two other people from Apple that we called based on internal and external references get offers.  One interviewed yesterday, one is interviewing today.  I&#39;ll have the results later this afternoon. Here is what Carrie wrote a couple of minutes ago.  I&#39;ll definitely meet [REDACTED] today.  If any of you are available, it will probably help, since Steve Jobs is meeting with [REDACTED] to try to sell him on interesting projects in Apple.</p><p><span>Alan</span></p><p><span>So I got another irate call from jobs today.</span></p><p>In reviewing the data below again, I do think this could be treated as not just an employee referral since he referred essentially a whole team.  So a compromise would be to continue with the offer we have made (to [REDACTED]) but not to make offers to any of the others unless they get permission from Apple.</p><p>In any case, lets not make any new offers or contact new people at Apple until we have had a chance to discuss.</p><p><span>--Sergey</span></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1610099684345024512" rel="">Original tweet</a></p><p><span>Previously: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/techemails/status/1443263744906305543" rel="">Steve Jobs emails Eric Schmidt</a><span> (March 7, 2007)</span></p><p><span>Previously: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1422603572814962692" rel="">Palm CEO Ed Colligan corresponds with Steve Jobs</a><span> (August 24, 2007)</span></p><p>To publish @TechEmails last year, we tracked more than a hundred active court cases and reviewed more than 10,000 filings. But there are still noteworthy documents that we miss, so we’re always appreciative when readers point us towards:</p><ul><li><p>New court cases in the tech industry</p></li><li><p>New documents or exhibits from federal courts</p></li><li><p>New documents or exhibits from state or local courts, some of which can be prohibitively expensive or unavailable online</p></li><li><p><span>New documents or exhibits from older cases, some of which can be difficult to unearth years later. (For example, during the trial for </span><em>In re Apple iPod iTunes Antitrust Litigation (2014)</em><span>, the trial exhibits were provided to the press on USB drives. We’re hoping that a friend of @TechEmails saved a copy.)</span></p></li></ul><p><span>Just reply to this email or send a DM to </span><a href="https://twitter.com/techemails" rel="">@TechEmails</a><span>.
