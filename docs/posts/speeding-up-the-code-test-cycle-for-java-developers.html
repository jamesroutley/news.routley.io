    <h1>Show HN: Speeding up the code-test cycle for Java developers</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Hello HN, I am Parth. In my experience, the current form of testing automation takes too long. To solve this, I am creating a developer tool to speed up the code-test cycle for Java developers. It has two main parts:</p><p>Direct Invoke - lets you call any Java function directly, without the need to execute the whole call hierarchy. (e.g. an HTTP endpoint) In my normal coding workflow, I use the “Evaluate Expression” feature inside IntelliJ IDE. I usually put a breakpoint somewhere in the code and after hitting the breakpoint by calling an HTTP api, let the execution remain paused while I explore and see the return values of functions. “Evaluate Expression” was quite useful in exploring new codebases and checking return values of my own functions as a sanity test. The direct invoke feature implements the same functionality without needing to hit a breakpoint. Now, I can just navigate to any function in the editor and execute it. The parameter values are input as JSON and deserialize to an object of the required class instances.</p><p>Atomic Run - lets you hot-reload the code changes and highlights the difference in the return values of the changed function before and after the hot-reload. I feel Atomic Run has the potential of replacing unit test cases, but there is a long way to go. I am thinking of implementing</p><pre><code>  - Option for mocking dependency calls: We want to give the developer more control over the testing environment by allowing them to mock downstream dependency calls.


  - Customizing assertions: Not all differences in return values indicate breaking changes. Assertions should be flexible to accommodate non-breaking changes.


  - Workflow to save this data to a file (thinking something like JSON based fixtures): making it easier to organize and reuse test data.

This plugin is still in the early stages, so we&#39;d appreciate your help in ironing out any bugs you come across. Get in touch with me on my discord channel.</p><p>To try it out, install Unlogged from the IntelliJ Marketplace and start your java application using the java agent (the plugin has instructions to download)</p><p>Link to try the plugin: <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18529-unlogged" rel="nofollow">https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18529-unlogged</a></p></div></div></div>
