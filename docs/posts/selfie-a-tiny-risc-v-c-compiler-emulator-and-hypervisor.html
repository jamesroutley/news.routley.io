      <p>Selfie is a project of the <a href="http://www.cs.uni-salzburg.at/~ck">Computational Systems Group</a> at the Department of Computer Sciences of the University of Salzburg in Austria.</p>

<p>The Selfie Project provides an educational platform for teaching undergraduate and graduate students the design and implementation of programming languages and runtime systems. The focus is on the construction of compilers, libraries, operating systems, and even virtual machine monitors. The common theme is to identify and resolve self-reference in systems code which is seen as the key challenge when teaching systems engineering, hence the name.</p>
