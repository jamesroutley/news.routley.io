<p><b>Tarrare</b> (c. 1772 – 1798), sometimes spelled <b>Tarare</b>, was a French showman and soldier, noted for his unusual appetite and eating habits. Able to eat vast amounts of meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him and he was turned out of the family home as a teenager. He travelled France in the company of a band of prostitutes and thieves before becoming the warm-up act for a travelling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlatan" title="Charlatan">charlatan</a>. In this act he would swallow corks, stones, live animals, and a whole basketful of apples. He then took this act to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> where he worked as a street performer.
</p><p>At the start of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_the_First_Coalition" title="War of the First Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a>, Tarrare joined the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolutionary_Army" title="French Revolutionary Army">French Revolutionary Army</a>, where even quadruple the standard military ration was unable to satisfy his large appetite. He would eat any available food from gutters and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. He was hospitalised due to exhaustion and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards, and puppies, and swallowed eels whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was underweight and, with the exception of his eating habits, he showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.
</p><p>General <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_de_Beauharnais" title="Alexandre de Beauharnais">Alexandre de Beauharnais</a> decided to put Tarrare&#39;s abilities to military use, and employed him as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier" title="Courier">courier</a> for the French army, with the intention that he would swallow documents, pass through enemy lines, and recover them from his stool once safely at his destination. Tarrare could not speak German and on his first mission he was captured by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Prussia" title="Kingdom of Prussia">Prussian</a> forces, severely beaten, and underwent a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_execution" title="Mock execution">mock execution</a> before being returned to French lines.
</p><p>Chastened by this experience, he agreed to submit to any procedure that might cure his appetite, and was treated with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudanum" title="Laudanum">laudanum</a>, tobacco pills, wine vinegar, and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offal" title="Offal">offal</a> in gutters, rubbish heaps and outside butchers&#39; shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler, he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versailles_(city)" title="Versailles (city)">Versailles</a> with a case of severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudative_diarrhoea" title="Exudative diarrhoea">exudative diarrhoea</a>.

<p>Tarrare was born near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon" title="Lyon">Lyon</a>, around 1772.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_203_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_203-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Gould_&amp;_Pyle_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Gould_&amp;_Pyle-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[note 1]</a></sup> His date of birth is unrecorded and it is not even known if Tarrare was his real name or a nickname.
</p><p>As a child, Tarrare had a huge appetite and by his teens could eat a quarter of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle" title="Cattle">bullock</a>, weighing as much as Tarrare himself, in a single day. By this time, his parents could not provide for him and had forced him to leave home.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_203_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_203-1">[1]</a></sup> For some years after this, he toured the country with a roaming band of thieves and prostitutes, begging and stealing for food,<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_203_1-3"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_203-1">[1]</a></sup> before gaining employment as a warm-up act to a travelling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlatan" title="Charlatan">charlatan</a>. Tarrare would draw a crowd by eating corks, stones and live animals, and by swallowing an entire basketful of apples one after the other.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_203_1-4"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_203-1">[1]</a></sup> He would eat ravenously and was particularly fond of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake#Consumption" title="Snake">snake meat</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Gould_&amp;_Pyle_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-Gould_&amp;_Pyle-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1788, Tarrare moved to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> to work as a street performer. He appears to have been successful in general, but on one occasion the act went wrong and he suffered severe <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intestinal_obstruction" title="Intestinal obstruction">intestinal obstruction</a>. Members of the crowd carried him to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B4tel-Dieu_de_Paris" title="Hôtel-Dieu de Paris">Hôtel-Dieu</a> hospital, where he was treated with powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxative" title="Laxative">laxatives</a>. He made a full recovery and offered to demonstrate his act by eating his surgeon&#39;s watch and chain; M. Giraud, the surgeon, was unimpressed by the offer and warned him that if he did so, he would cut Tarrare open to recover the items.

<p>Despite his unusual diet, Tarrare was slim and of average height. At the age of 17, he weighed only <span>100 pounds</span> (<span>45 kg; 7 st 2 lb</span>).<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_203_1-5"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_203-1">[1]</a></sup> He was described as having unusually soft fair hair and an abnormally wide mouth (roughly four inches between his jaws when his mouth was fully extended),<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_205_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_205-11">[10]</a></sup> in which his teeth were heavily stained and on which the lips were almost invisible.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_205_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_205-11">[10]</a></sup> When he had not eaten, his skin would hang so loosely that he could wrap the fold of skin from his abdomen around his waist. When full, his abdomen would distend &#34;like a huge balloon&#34;. The skin of his cheeks was wrinkled and hung loosely, and when stretched out, he could hold twelve eggs or apples in his mouth.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_205_11-2"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_205-11">[10]</a></sup>
</p><p>His body was hot to the touch and he sweated heavily; he constantly had foul body odour;<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_205_11-3"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_205-11">[10]</a></sup> he was described as stinking &#34;to such a degree that he could not be endured within the distance of twenty paces&#34;.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_205_11-4"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_205-11">[10]</a></sup> This smell would get noticeably worse after he had eaten;<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_205_11-5"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_205-11">[10]</a></sup> his eyes and cheeks would become bloodshot, a visible vapour would rise from his body,<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_205_11-6"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_205-11">[10]</a></sup> and he would become lethargic, during which time he would belch noisily and his jaws would make swallowing motions.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_205_11-7"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_205-11">[10]</a></sup> He had chronic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhoea" title="Diarrhoea">diarrhoea</a>, which was said to be &#34;fetid beyond all conception&#34;.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_205_11-8"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_205-11">[10]</a></sup> Despite his large intake of food, he did not appear either to vomit excessively or to gain weight. Aside from his eating habits, his contemporaries saw no apparent signs of mental illness or unusual behaviour in him, other than an apparently apathetic temperament with &#34;a complete lack of force and ideas&#34;.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_205_11-9"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_205-11">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-The_Cat_Eaters_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-The_Cat_Eaters-15">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p>The cause of Tarrare&#39;s behaviour is not known.

<p>Courville and Percy decided to test Tarrare&#39;s capacity for food. A meal had been prepared for 15 labourers near the hospital gates; although generally hospital staff restrained Tarrare in the presence of food, on this occasion Courville allowed him to reach the table undisturbed. Tarrare ate the entire meal of two large meat pies, plates of grease and salt and four gallons of milk, and then immediately fell asleep;<sup id="cite_ref-Gould_&amp;_Pyle_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-Gould_&amp;_Pyle-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_204_18-1"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_204-18">[17]</a></sup> Courville noted that Tarrare&#39;s belly became taut and inflated like a large balloon.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_204_18-2"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_204-18">[17]</a></sup> On another occasion Tarrare was presented with a live cat.

<p>After several months he spent as an experimental case, military authorities began to press for Tarrare to be returned to active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare&#39;s eating habits and digestive system, and approached <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_de_Beauharnais" title="Alexandre de Beauharnais">General Alexandre de Beauharnais</a> with a suggestion that Tarrare&#39;s unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_204_18-3"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_204-18">[17]</a></sup> Courville proposed to de Beauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents securely through enemy territory with no risk of them being found if he were searched.
</p><p>Tarrare was called on by Beauharnais to demonstrate his abilities before a gathering of the commanders of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_the_Rhine_(France)" title="Army of the Rhine (France)">Army of the Rhine</a>. Having swallowed the box successfully, Tarrare was given a wheelbarrow filled with 30 pounds (14 kg) of raw bull&#39;s lungs and liver as a reward,<sup id="cite_ref-Gould_&amp;_Pyle_2-6"><a href="#cite_note-Gould_&amp;_Pyle-2">[2]</a></sup> which he immediately ate in front of the assembled generals.
</p><p>Following this successful demonstration, Tarrare became employed officially as a spy of the Army of the Rhine. Although General de Beauharnais was convinced of Tarrare&#39;s physical capacity to carry messages internally, he was concerned about his mental state and reluctant to entrust him initially with significant military documents. Tarrare was ordered as his first assignment to carry a message to a French colonel imprisoned by the Prussians near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neustadt_an_der_Weinstra%C3%9Fe" title="Neustadt an der Weinstraße">Neustadt</a>; he was told that the documents were of great military significance, but in reality de Beauharnais had merely written a note asking the colonel to confirm that the message had been received successfully, and if so to return a reply of any potentially useful information about Prussian troop movements.
</p><p>Tarrare crossed Prussian lines under cover of darkness, disguised as a German peasant. Unable to speak German, he soon attracted the attention of local residents, who alerted the Prussian authorities, and he was captured outside <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau" title="Landau">Landau</a>. A strip search found nothing suspicious on his person, and despite being whipped by Prussian soldiers, he refused to betray his mission. Brought before the local Prussian commander, General Zoegli, he again refused to talk and was imprisoned. After 24 hours of captivity, Tarrare relented and explained the scheme to his captors. He was chained to a latrine, and eventually, 30 hours after being swallowed,<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_204_18-4"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_204-18">[17]</a></sup> the wooden box emerged. Zoegli was furious when the documents, which Tarrare had said contained vital intelligence, transpired only to be de Beauharnais&#39;s dummy message, and Tarrare was taken to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallows" title="Gallows">gallows</a> and the noose placed around his neck. (Some sources state that Zoegli never retrieved the box, as Tarrare had the presence of mind to recover and eat the stool containing it before it could be seized by the Prussians.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_204_18-5"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_204-18">[17]</a></sup>) At the last minute, Zoegli relented, and Tarrare was taken down from the scaffold, given a severe beating, and released near the French lines.

<p>Following this incident, Tarrare was desperate to avoid further military service, and returned to the hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudanum" title="Laudanum">laudanum</a> without success; further treatments with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar" title="Vinegar">wine vinegar</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a> pills were likewise unsuccessful.<sup id="cite_ref-LMPJ1919_204_18-6"><a href="#cite_note-LMPJ1919_204-18">[17]</a></sup> Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiled_egg" title="Boiled egg">boiled eggs</a>, but this also failed to suppress his appetite.

</p><p>After some time, a 14-month-old child disappeared from the hospital, and Tarrare was immediately suspected.

<p>Four years later, in 1798, a M. Tessier of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versailles_(city)" title="Versailles (city)">Versailles</a> hospital contacted Percy to notify him that a patient of theirs wished to see him. It was Tarrare, now bedridden and weak. Tarrare told Percy that he had swallowed a golden fork two years earlier, which he believed was lodged inside him and causing his current weakness. He hoped that Percy could find some way to remove it. Percy, however, recognised that he had advanced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. A month later, Tarrare began to experience continuous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exudative_diarrhoea" title="Exudative diarrhoea">exudative diarrhoea</a>, dying shortly afterwards.
</p><p>The corpse rotted quickly; the surgeons of the hospital refused to dissect it.
