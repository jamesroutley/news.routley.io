          <p dir="auto">GrapheneOS Foundation has been planning to host a network location service for GrapheneOS and projects collaborating with us for a while now. We&#39;ve received significant funding we can put to use for this to make a high quality, modern implementation on both the client and server side. A new unified app (cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth beacons) for gathering data to publish as fully open data could also be part of it. We also plan to make a SUPL implementation as part of the same service as an alternative to our Google SUPL proxy to replace it as the default in the long term.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main issue is obtaining high quality and reliable data to run the service. It&#39;s necessary to get a lot more users helping with it than Mozilla had submitting data. It seems to have been dying off for a while now. Simply accepting all user submissions of data also makes it easy to poison the database, which becomes a major concern for a less research focused project that&#39;s meant to be widely used in production. We have a plan for dealing with this using hardware-based attestation able to support submitting data from any modern Android device with the security model intact and recent security patches. Other mitigations are also needed. OpenCelliD exists but it would be very easy for people to ruin it if they haven&#39;t already, and we&#39;re dealing with those kinds of attacks on a regular basis so we know we can&#39;t use something not resistant to it. The experience of users with the existing services indicates to us that the existing data is problematic.</p>
<p dir="auto">We&#39;re not aware of sources for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth data. It would be best to gather it from a unified app handling all of it with the resulting database being completely open data. We&#39;ve never understood the privacy concern with providing a map of networks that are publicly broadcasting and are meant to be static landmarks. If they move around regularly, they shouldn&#39;t be included anyway, and those should be possible to distinguish. It seems highly unlikely that Mozilla would pass on this data to anyone else based on how they see it. They also may be forbidden to do that from the settlement they reached.</p>
<p dir="auto">The key is figuring out how to get a large number of users to run an app submitting cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth beacon data in a way that it&#39;s difficult enough to mess with it maliciously. The people who care about this tend to care about their privacy and probably don&#39;t want to be submitting this kind of data during regular use of their devices, especially if the data is kept tied to the accounts submitting it for anti-abuse. Publishing it all as open data available for any purpose is crucial for getting people to be interested in submitting the data. Anyone being able to use for anything without constraints will give a lot of incentive to contribute to it. Mozilla wasn&#39;t making the most valuable data available to others. Having that data public also allows people to use it locally, which is important for privacy. Sending your location in real-time to a service isn&#39;t great regardless of who is hosting it even if you can do it without an account via a VPN / Tor, particularly if relatively few people use it.</p>
<p dir="auto">We&#39;re not at all happy with the existing approaches in this area and if anyone wants to build something better, we&#39;re interested in funding serious work on building it as remote work by people with experience working on similar things. This has been something we haven&#39;t considered a near term project but if there&#39;s suddenly a bunch of interest in it, perhaps it could be.</p>
<p dir="auto">Relying on another centralized service that&#39;s not publishing the data would be a shame.</p>

<p dir="auto">I&#39;m thinking of this as an &#34;OpenStreetMap of location data&#34;. When people contribute locations to OSM, they are by nature implying that they were in the area—and they&#39;re fine with that.</p>
<p dir="auto">Of course, location data is very different because the sharing process will likely be automated, not submitted through a conscious process. I can&#39;t speak for everyone, but I personally would be happy to submit this data to a trusted organisation. To make things even better, perhaps the account data can be de-linked after a reasonably long time, when most of the anti-abuse use-case has expired.</p>

<p dir="auto">We have a plan for dealing with this using hardware-based attestation able to support submitting data from any modern Android device with the security model intact and recent security patches.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This feels bad. Can&#39;t see this implemented in a open source/community friendly way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Data could be accepted from anywhere and simply not trusted without a way to confirm, with this being one way to show it has high confidence. It&#39;s possible to support any alternate OS as long as it implements a security model where the app can have strong confidence that it&#39;s not getting poisoned data. Apple and Google have a massive amount of data being submitted and can use lots of signals to determine if it&#39;s valid too. For a service with very little data, it&#39;s very easy for people to mess with it submitting poisoned data. It&#39;s too easy to submit fake data to a service like <a href="https://opencellid.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenCelliD</a>, or even more so with Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth beacons. That brings the overall data into question. Making it significantly harder will get rid of nearly all the poisoned data even though it&#39;s still theoretically possible to do it. The rest can be handled with moderation.</p>

<p dir="auto">Hot take, I&#39;m okay with that. Trying to fight anti-abuse when only collecting anonymous data is impossible. I would data connected to my account as long as I can trust the provider (clear privacy policy, legal limitation on the use of provided data) and a good anonymization process of the data (wifi endpoints only published after multiple accounts have seen them independently) and obviously if both backend and clients are open source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">There could be an opt-in to the level of privacy provided where the default could be something like not using the data until 3+ accounts have seen the networks, but with the option for less. Hardware attestation can give high confidence in the data being valid without needing to confirm it from several accounts believed to be separate people, and any app can use hardware attestation without any special privileges since it&#39;s privacy preserving, so I really think that&#39;s a good way to avoid needing to do something privacy invasive to confirm accounts are legitimate.</p>

<p dir="auto">That&#39;s what I said: it&#39;s not open data usable for any purpose. Non-commercial usage restriction would prevent hosting a service which can be used for commercial usage itself. Normally, you can&#39;t simply bypass a license wrapping it behind something. They&#39;d need to be asked what they would permit and there&#39;s no way to make an open data service from licensing proprietary data. We want anyone to be able to host it.</p>

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Writing &#34;it is&#34; as &#34;it&#39;s&#34; twice in a row is not misuse of the apostrophe, and I&#39;m not sure how it would make it harder to understand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">but if you&#39;re using the data for commercial purposes then you by definition have the funds to license the data</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Publishing a service usable by anyone for any purpose for free is likely considered commercial use of the data because people would be using the service for commercial purposes. Cannot simply wrap it up in a non-profit service that&#39;s used commercially. They may also have an issue with taking donations to support a service.</p>
<p dir="auto">We want an open source service with open data. Paying for data with heavily restricted usage terms wouldn&#39;t work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">It certainly sounds like you&#39;re forging ahead on <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/" rel="nofollow">this path</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Mozilla&#39;s location service wasn&#39;t even an implementation of what we want because it was no longer maintaining / promoting data submission and the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth data wasn&#39;t open. It has degraded over time. I hadn&#39;t seen the legal situation it was in before yesterday and that partially explains the situation. I think it would have rotted away and been discontinued either way, but it probably accelerated that. I think the death of the service was inevitable with FirefoxOS. Cannot really expect them to maintain a service they don&#39;t need and which has little to do with their main project.</p>
<p dir="auto">Wigle is a proprietary service with proprietary data. Making an open source and open data service is not reinventing the wheel. Mozilla&#39;s service had largely proprietary, non-published data too, for the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth part of it. The service itself and the cell data were published.</p>

          <p dir="auto">For users that are very privacy aware, I suggest to prefetch the cell towers in their region and not use accurate wifi-based location at all. Prefetched cell tower data would also be sufficient for faster GPS via local SUPL, which doesn&#39;t need high accuracy and can handle inaccuracies of tens of kilometers pretty fine.</p>
<p dir="auto">I doubt that protecting a location service with device attestation makes a lot of sense for two reasons:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>You want people that are able and willing to collect wifi locations using highly sensitive long distance hardware to do that and contribute. This hardware is very likely not compliant with any attestations, but can be an extremely good source.</li>
<li>Even when device attestation is used, it is &#34;trivial&#34; to introduce wrong records, as we&#39;re talking about uploading data that was previously retrieved from public radio airspace. Setting up a device that appears as a hotspot with arbitrary strength and mac address is easy enough for people that are willing to abuse.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Publishing the raw data (both raw data of submissions and raw locations of wifi hotspots) can be a serious privacy issue - entirely independent of what privacy laws might state. As you are concerned with abuse, please also consider the abuse risk of this data. For example, stalkers will be able to follow their victims even when they move to a different location for as long as they continue to use the same wifi hardware.</p>
<p dir="auto">Requiring an account for uploading data is not generally a bad idea, however this account setup should be as easy as possible (e.g. could be just generating a unique random id client side). If passive contributing (that is: uploading data about wifi networks when GPS is already in use anyway) is easy to activate (e.g. just ticking a box) this would allow users to contribute without any downsides. A unique random id would still be useful for abuse prevention, as continued and proven correct submissions from a unique id could be used to increase trust in its data - so the &#34;account&#34; would only be used to gain trust, not to ban bad actors (which is hard anyways, as they will likely be able to create a new identity).</p>

<p dir="auto">Any service we provide needs to be heavily protected from abuse, as do the people involved in it. All of our services are targeted with attacks including denial of service, Child Sex Abuse Material spam, gore spam and harassment. If the service has any form of comments or discussions related to it, all of that is relevant too.</p>
<p dir="auto">This gives us the advantage of already being prepared for the abuse that will eventually target a service like this once it becomes popular. We&#39;re already thinking about it and preparing for it before even starting.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">It&#39;s possible to have both the concept of trusted contributors who have an established account with a history of submitting valid data and can apply to submit data from a non-verified device. The quality of the resulting data heavily depends on not simply accepting any data submission and treating all data submissions as equal. The data submitted by different hardware will also vary in how it needs to be treated.</p>

<p dir="auto">Hardware attestation provides a baseline which allows deploying other mitigations against abuse. People doing this also have a limit to how much money they&#39;re willing to spend on new phones.</p>

<p dir="auto">Wigle supports lookups by SSID/MAC already:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://wigle.net/" rel="nofollow">https://wigle.net/</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Therefore, it doesn&#39;t seem to be a valid reason to oppose publishing open data. Many people believe in gathering and publishing this as data in the public domain usable for any purpose. A service making the data available to everyone has a much higher chance of success than one hoarding it and building a business model around it. That&#39;s not what we want to do. Submitting data to companies profiting off it without compensating the people submitting it or giving them rights to the overall data doesn&#39;t seem right.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some of the main perpetrators of the attacks on GrapheneOS and myself are among the main developers of your project. It was one of your supporters who did multiple swatting attacks targeting me in April 2023 with the clear aim of having me killed by law enforcement. It was carefully crafted to maximize the chance of that outcome. Perhaps if was one of the people who makes commits to your project who did it. You probably wouldn&#39;t kick them out even if we obtained proof of that based on past experience. Doesn&#39;t make any sense for someone like yourself who says you only care about the code and will allow nazis to contribute to your project if they write good code to start pretending to care about abuse.</p>
