    <h1>Mozilla will be retiring the Mozilla Location Service</h1>

          <p dir="auto">GrapheneOS Foundation has been planning to host a network location service for GrapheneOS and projects collaborating with us for a while now. We&#39;ve received significant funding we can put to use for this to make a high quality, modern implementation on both the client and server side. A new unified app (cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth beacons) for gathering data to publish as fully open data could also be part of it. We also plan to make a SUPL implementation as part of the same service as an alternative to our Google SUPL proxy to replace it as the default in the long term.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main issue is obtaining high quality and reliable data to run the service. It&#39;s necessary to get a lot more users helping with it than Mozilla had submitting data. It seems to have been dying off for a while now. Simply accepting all user submissions of data also makes it easy to poison the database, which becomes a major concern for a less research focused project that&#39;s meant to be widely used in production. We have a plan for dealing with this using hardware-based attestation able to support submitting data from any modern Android device with the security model intact and recent security patches. Other mitigations are also needed. OpenCelliD exists but it would be very easy for people to ruin it if they haven&#39;t already, and we&#39;re dealing with those kinds of attacks on a regular basis so we know we can&#39;t use something not resistant to it. The experience of users with the existing services indicates to us that the existing data is problematic.</p>
<p dir="auto">We&#39;re not aware of sources for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth data. It would be best to gather it from a unified app handling all of it with the resulting database being completely open data. We&#39;ve never understood the privacy concern with providing a map of networks that are publicly broadcasting and are meant to be static landmarks. If they move around regularly, they shouldn&#39;t be included anyway, and those should be possible to distinguish. It seems highly unlikely that Mozilla would pass on this data to anyone else based on how they see it. They also may be forbidden to do that from the settlement they reached.</p>
<p dir="auto">The key is figuring out how to get a large number of users to run an app submitting cellular, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth beacon data in a way that it&#39;s difficult enough to mess with it maliciously. The people who care about this tend to care about their privacy and probably don&#39;t want to be submitting this kind of data during regular use of their devices, especially if the data is kept tied to the accounts submitting it for anti-abuse. Publishing it all as open data available for any purpose is crucial for getting people to be interested in submitting the data. Anyone being able to use for anything without constraints will give a lot of incentive to contribute to it. Mozilla wasn&#39;t making the most valuable data available to others. Having that data public also allows people to use it locally, which is important for privacy. Sending your location in real-time to a service isn&#39;t great regardless of who is hosting it even if you can do it without an account via a VPN / Tor, particularly if relatively few people use it.</p>
<p dir="auto">We&#39;re not at all happy with the existing approaches in this area and if anyone wants to build something better, we&#39;re interested in funding serious work on building it as remote work by people with experience working on similar things. This has been something we haven&#39;t considered a near term project but if there&#39;s suddenly a bunch of interest in it, perhaps it could be.</p>
<p dir="auto">Relying on another centralized service that&#39;s not publishing the data would be a shame.</p>
