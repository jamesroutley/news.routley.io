    <h1>Learning C</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><p>I am beginning to learn C, and I <a href="https://twitter.com/iavins/status/1625896692175486976">asked for resources</a> on the same. Here is what I got:</p><ol><li>K&amp;R C book - This is the OG book. It is short and concise. However, it is old now and has some minor bad practices/incorrect code apparently.</li><li>Modern C by Jens Gustedt - This is a more modern book. However, the book expects that you know <em>some C</em> and can be difficult for someone new like me to pick up. This book is also available for free online.</li><li>Effective C by Robert C. Seacord - Another introductory alternative. This also teaches modern practices and is beginner friendly.</li></ol><h2 id="advice">Advice</h2><p>I asked my fren, Mr. xyz, a C veteran who has worked in various domains from battery controllers to databases, for advice on learning C. The advice I received:</p><p>Follow these books (in order):</p><ol><li>K&amp;R C</li><li>Programming in the UNIX Environment</li><li>Programming Abstractions in C</li></ol><p>An alternate path:</p><ol><li>Effective C</li><li>Modern C</li></ol><p>K&amp;R style and modern style are different, but both are prevalent in different areas. Start with one, completely understand the philosophy, idioms, and patterns, and then move to the other.</p><p>Do the K&amp;R and Programming Abstractions in C exercises in the modern style. These exercises are invaluable. They may seem simple, but they are a pretty good test of understanding C.</p><p>The depth comes only when you work with simple code and see how small changes can have big effects.</p><h2 id="cthulhu">Cthulhu</h2><p>The very apt cover of Modern C:</p><img src="https://avi.im/blag/images/2024/c-for-cthulhu.jpeg" alt="C for Cthulhu"/><p>My goals are:</p><ul><li>Port <a href="https://github.com/avinassh/py-caskdb">CaskDB</a> to C</li><li>Make a major contribution to libSQL</li></ul></article></div></div>
