  <p>Reposting the <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/zzprkr/weekly_lobsters_office_hours">announcement posted on Lobsters</a> for my blog’s rss feed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey folks,</p>

  <p>When this post is two hours old, and indefinitely twice a week, I’m going to stream Lobsters office hours and development on Twitch.
The <a href="https://twitch.tv/pushcx">channel is here</a> and more info + an archive is <a href="https://push.cx/stream">on my blog</a>. (You don’t have to sign up to Twitch to watch.)</p>

  <p>The office hours are largely to support iteratively running <a href="https://lobste.rs/about#queries">queries</a>.
People don’t take me up on this very often except via IRC because it’s hard to write these things perfectly out of the gate.
Having a fast feedback loop is essential.
Also, maybe having an open office hours session will be a nicely informal opportunity to answer questions and generally demystify the site.</p>

  <p>If nobody has questions I’ll hack on the Lobsters codebase.
Hopefully this encourages more activity on the <a href="https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters">repo</a>.
I’m also open to support people using the code to start a sister site, which is another activity that benefits from a tight feedback loop.
(<a href="https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/issues/1265">example</a>)</p>

  <p>I plan to stream weekly on (US Central) Monday afternoons at 2 PM and Thursday mornings at 9 AM in the hopes that this gives reasonable timezone coverage.
Sorry for the inconvenience if you are antipodal to Chicago, though the site has <a href="https://github.com/lobsters/lobsters/blob/f2d7f4a8465ddf9141057c293ac4bb6d253143f3/config/application.rb#L40">always run on Chicago time</a>.
Sessions will probably run 1.5 to 3 hours and I’ll put summaries and transcripts in <a href="https://push.cx/stream">my archive</a> for easy searching.
I’ll try to keep the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pushcx/schedule">twitch schedule</a> up-to-date and I already know I’ll miss 9/1 for a vacation.</p>

  <p>This is pretty experimental!
I did it a few streams back in summer of 2020 that went well, but everything was pretty chaotic that year <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">for some reason</a> and I dropped it.
I did a technical rehearsal this weekend that <a href="https://push.cx/stream/2024-08-10-test-stream">went reasonably smoothly</a>.
If this continues to be interesting and useful, I’ll keep it up and try new things.
Feedback here, in the stream chat, or by email (peter@ <a href="https://push.cx">my domain</a>) is much appreciated.</p>

  <p>Special guest host will be my cat (subject to his schedule and whim). See y’all in our weird parasocial future.</p>
