    <h1>Coccinelle: The Linux kernel&#39;s source-to-source transformation tool</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><div><pre>                            Coccinelle


Coccinelle allows programmers to easily write some complex
style-preserving source-to-source transformations on C source code,
like for instance to perform some refactorings.

To install Coccinelle from its source, see the instructions in install.txt.
Once you have installed coccinelle, there is a script &#39;spatch&#39; in /usr/bin
or /usr/local/bin that invokes the Coccinelle program.

You can download pre-compiled versions of spatch and check which distributions
package it here: <a href="https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/download.html" rel="nofollow">https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/download.html</a>

If you want to run Coccinelle without installing it, you can run the
Coccinelle program directly from the download/build directory. You may then
have to setup a few environment variables so that the Coccinelle program
knows where to find its configuration files.
For bash do:

  $ source env.sh

For tcsh do:

  $ source env.csh


You can test coccinelle with:

  $ spatch --sp-file demos/simple.cocci demos/simple.c -o /tmp/new_simple.c

If you haven&#39;t installed coccinelle, run then ./spatch or ./spatch.opt



If you downloaded the bytecode version of spatch you may first
have to install OCaml (which contains the &#39;ocamlrun&#39; bytecode interpreter,
the equivalent of &#39;java&#39;, the Java virtual machine, but for OCaml) and then do:

  $ ocamlrun spatch --sp-file demos/simple.cocci demos/simple.c -o /tmp/new_simple.c


For more information on Coccinelle, type &#39;make docs&#39; and have a look at the
files in the docs/ directory. You may need to install the texlive-fonts-extra
packages from your distribution to compile some of the LaTeX documentation
files.

 ** Runtime dependencies under Debian/Ubuntu**

 - For the OCaml scripting feature in SmPL
	ocaml-native-compilers
     or ocaml-nox

 - For the Python scripting feature in SmPL: python3-dev
   Note python3-dev is only a runtime dependency: it is _not_ required for
   building coccinelle.

Contributing:

Contributions are welcome.  Please sign your contributions, according to
the following text extracted from Documentation/SubmittingPatches.txt of
the Linux kernel:

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to
pass it on as an open-source patch.  The rules are pretty simple: if you
can certify the below:

        Developer&#39;s Certificate of Origin 1.1

        By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

        (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
            have the right to submit it under the open source license
            indicated in the file; or

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

	(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
	    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
	    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
	    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
	    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

then you just add a line saying

	Signed-off-by: Random J Developer &lt;random@developer.example.org&gt;

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)
