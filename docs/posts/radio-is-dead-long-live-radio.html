      <p>This post will be fairly quick, just a shout-out to a project I’ve been fond of for quite some time.</p>
<p>Some of you might know <a href="http://radio4000.com/">Radio4000</a>, a website for Youtube-based radio players. I’ve had a fairly active radio there for quite some time now and really enjoy the site. They now <a href="https://blog.radio4000.com/post/166686068942/radio4000-player-embed-with-iframe">introduced</a> an embeddable version of the radio player. Here’s mine:</p>

<p>It’s really easy to embed. The nice folks at <a href="https://internet4000.com/">internet4000</a> built <a href="https://github.com/internet4000/radio4000-player">a tool</a> that lets you create an embeddable player pretty easily. They really did a great job on that front, but that shouldn’t surprise anyone who is familiar with their work. And of course it is open source! This is all the code you need:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://api.radio4000.com/embed?slug=&lt;name&gt;&#34;
        width=&#34;320&#34;
        height=&#34;500&#34;
        frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;!-- alternatively --&gt;

&lt;script async src=&#34;https://unpkg.com/radio4000-player&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;radio4000-player channel-slug=&#34;&lt;name&gt;&#34;&gt;&lt;/radio4000-player&gt;</code></pre>

<p>I’m continually astounded by the great UI/UX work of theirs, and quite enjoy the products they build. Definitely a crew to look out for.</p>
<p>I hope you have a good time looking through all of the great channels on Radio4000! Have a great day!</p>
