        <p>Master Foo once said to a visiting programmer: <span>“<span>There is
                    more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand
                    lines of C.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The programmer, who was very proud of his mastery of C, said:
            <span>“<span>How can this be? C is the language in which the very kernel of
                    Unix is implemented!</span>”</span>
        </p>
        <p>Master Foo replied: <span>“<span>That is so. Nevertheless, there is
                    more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten thousand
                    lines of C.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The programmer grew distressed. <span>“<span>But through the C
                    language we experience the enlightenment of the Patriarch Ritchie! We
                    become as one with the operating system and the machine, reaping
                    matchless performance!</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo replied: <span>“<span>All that you say is true. But there
                    is still more Unix-nature in one line of shell script than there is in ten
                    thousand lines of C.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The programmer scoffed at Master Foo and rose to depart. But
            Master Foo nodded to his student Nubi, who wrote a line of shell
            script on a nearby whiteboard, and said: <span>“<span>Master programmer,
                    consider this pipeline. Implemented in pure C, would it not span ten
                    thousand lines?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The programmer muttered through his beard, contemplating what
            Nubi had written. Finally he agreed that it was so.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>And how many hours would you require to implement and
                    debug that C program?</span>”</span> asked Nubi.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Many,</span>”</span> admitted the visiting programmer.
            <span>“<span>But only a fool would spend the time to do that when so many
                    more worthy tasks await him.</span>”</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>“<span>And who better understands the Unix-nature?</span>”</span>
            Master Foo asked. <span>“<span>Is it he who writes the ten thousand
                    lines, or he who, perceiving the emptiness of the task, gains merit by
                    not coding?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Upon hearing this, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

        </div>
        <p>A stranger from the land of Woot came to Master Foo as he was
            eating the morning meal with his students.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>I hear y00 are very l33t,</span>”</span> he said.
            <span>“<span>Pl33z teach m3 all y00 know.</span>”</span>
        </p>
        <p>Master Foo&#39;s students looked at each other, confused by the
            stranger&#39;s barbarous language. Master Foo just smiled and replied:
            <span>“<span>You wish to learn the Way of Unix?</span>”</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>“<span>I want to b3 a wizard hax0r,</span>”</span> the stranger
            replied, <span>“<span>and 0wn ever3one&#39;s b0xen.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>I do not teach that Way,</span>”</span> replied Master Foo.</p>
        <p>The stranger grew agitated. <span>“<span>D00d, y00 r nothing but a
                    p0ser,</span>”</span> he said. <span>“<span>If y00 n00 anything, y00 wud
                    t33ch
                    m3.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>There is a path,</span>”</span> said Master Foo, <span>“<span>that
                    might bring you to wisdom.</span>”</span> The master scribbled an IP address on
            a piece of paper. <span>“<span>Cracking this box should pose you little
                    difficulty, as its guardians are incompetent. Return and tell me
                    what you find.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The stranger bowed and left. Master Foo finished his meal.</p>
        <p>Days passed, then months. The stranger was forgotten.</p>
        <p>Years later, the stranger from the land of Woot returned.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Damn you!</span>”</span> he said, <span>“<span>I cracked that box, and
                    it was easy like you said. But I got busted by the FBI and thrown
                    in jail.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>Good,</span>”</span> said Master Foo. <span>“<span>You are ready for
                    the next lesson.</span>”</span> He scribbled an IP address on another piece
            of paper and handed it to the stranger.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Are you <span><em>crazy</em></span>?</span>”</span>
            the stranger
            yelled. <span>“<span>After what I&#39;ve been through, I&#39;m never going to break
                    into a computer again!</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo smiled. <span>“<span>Here,</span>”</span> he said, <span>“<span>is the
                    beginning of wisdom.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>On hearing this, the stranger was enlightened.</p>

                    </h2>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Master Foo instructed his students:</p>
        <p><span>“<span>There is a line of dharma teaching, exemplified by the
                    Patriarch McIlroy&#39;s mantra ‘Do one thing well’, which
                    emphasizes that software partakes of the Unix way when it has simple
                    and consistent behavior, with properties that can be readily modeled by
                    the mind of the user and used by other programs.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>But there is another line of dharma teaching, exemplified by the
                    Patriarch Thompson&#39;s great mantra <span>‘<span>When in doubt, use brute
                            force</span>’</span>, and various sutras on the value of getting 90% of cases
                    right <span><em>now</em></span>, rather than 100%
                    <span><em>later</em></span>, which emphasizes robustness and simplicity of
                    implementation.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>Now tell me: which programs have the Unix nature?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>After a silence, Nubi observed:</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Master, these teachings may conflict.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>A simple implementation is likely to lack logic for edge
                    cases, such as resource exhaustion, or failure to close a race window,
                    or a timeout during an uncompleted transaction.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>When such edge cases occur, the behavior of the software
                    will become irregular and difficult. Surely this is not the Way of
                    Unix?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo nodded in agreement.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>On the other hand, it is well known that fancy algorithms
                    are brittle. Further, each attempt to cover an edge case tends to
                    interact with both the program&#39;s central algorithms and the code
                    covering other edge cases.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>Thus, attempts to cover all edge cases in advance, guaranteeing
                    ‘simplicity of description’, may in fact produce code that is
                    overcomplicated and brittle or which, plagued by bugs, never ships at all.
                    Surely this is not the Way of Unix?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo nodded in agreement.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>What, then, is the proper dharma path?</span>”</span> asked Nubi.
        </p>
        <p>The master spoke:</p>
        <p><span>“<span>When the eagle flies, does it forget that its feet have
                    touched the ground? When the tiger lands upon its prey, does it
                    forget its moment in the air? Three pounds of VAX!</span>”</span></p>
        <p>On hearing this, Nubi was enlightened.</p>

        </div>
        <p>When Master Foo and his student Nubi journeyed among the sacred
            sites, it was the Master&#39;s custom in the evenings to offer public
            instruction to Unix neophytes of the towns and villages in which they
            stopped for the night.</p>
        <p>On one such occasion, a methodologist was among those
            who gathered to listen.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>If you do not repeatedly profile your code for hot spots
                    while tuning, you will be like a fisherman who casts his net in an
                    empty lake,</span>”</span> said Master Foo.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Is it not, then, also true,</span>”</span> said the methodology
            consultant, <span>“<span>that if you do not continually measure your
                    productivity while managing resources, you will be like a fisherman who
                    casts his net in an empty lake?</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>I once came upon a fisherman who just at that moment let
                    his net fall in the lake on which his boat was floating,</span>”</span> said
            Master Foo. <span>“<span>He scrabbled around in the bottom of his boat for
                    quite a while looking for it.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>But,</span>”</span> said the methodologist, <span>“<span>if
                    he had dropped his net in the lake, why was he looking in the
                    boat?</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>Because he could not swim,</span>”</span> replied Master Foo.</p>
        <p>Upon hearing this, the methodologist was enlightened.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>One evening, Master Foo and Nubi attended a gathering of
            programmers who had met to learn from each other. One of the
            programmers asked Nubi to what school he and his master belonged. Upon
            being told they were followers of the Great Way of Unix, the
            programmer grew scornful.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>The command-line tools of Unix are crude and
                    backward,</span>”</span> he scoffed. <span>“<span>Modern, properly
                    designed
                    operating systems do everything through a graphical user
                    interface.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo said nothing, but pointed at the moon. A nearby
            dog began to bark at the master&#39;s hand.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>I don&#39;t understand you!</span>”</span> said the programmer.</p>
        <p>Master Foo remained silent, and pointed at an image of the Buddha.
            Then he pointed at a window.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>What are you trying to tell me?</span>”</span> asked the
            programmer.</p>
        <p>Master Foo pointed at the programmer&#39;s head.
            Then he pointed at a rock.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Why can&#39;t you make yourself clear?</span>”</span> demanded the
            programmer.</p>
        <p>Master Foo frowned thoughtfully, tapped the programmer
            twice on the nose, and dropped him in a nearby trashcan.</p>
        <p>As the programmer was attempting to extricate himself from
            the garbage, the dog wandered over and piddled on him.</p>
        <p>At that moment, the programmer achieved enlightenment.</p>

        </div>
        <p>An experienced Unix programmer, hearing of Master Foo&#39;s wisdom,
            came to him for guidance. Approaching the Master, he bowed three
            times and said:</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Master Foo, I am gravely troubled. In my youth, those
                    who followed the Great Way of Unix used software that was simple and
                    unaffected, like ed and mailx. Today, they use vim and mutt.
                    Tomorrow I fear they will use KMail and Evolution, and Unix will have
                    become like Windows — bloated and covered over with
                    GUIs.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo said: <span>“<span>But what software do you use when you want to
                    draw a poster?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The programmer replied: <span>“<span>I...have never done that. But
                    I am sure that I could use LaTeX or pic to accomplish it without
                    GUIs, in the proper Unix way.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo then said: <span>“<span>Which one will reach the other side of the
                    river: The one who dreams of a raft, or the one that hitchhikes to the
                    next bridge?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Upon hearing this, the programmer was enlightened.</p>

        </div>
        <p>A Unix novice came to Master Foo and said: <span>“<span>I am
                    confused. Is it not the Unix way that every program should concentrate
                    on one thing and do it well?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo nodded.</p>
        <p>The novice continued: <span>“<span>Isn&#39;t it also the Unix way that the wheel
                    should not be reinvented?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo nodded again.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Why, then, are there several tools with similar
                    capabilities in text processing: sed, awk and Perl? With which one can
                    I best practice the Unix way?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo asked the novice: <span>“<span>If you have a text file, what tool
                    would you use to produce a copy with a few words in it replaced by
                    strings of your choosing?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The novice frowned and said: <span>“<span>Perl&#39;s regexps would be excessive for
                    so simple a task. I do not know awk, and I have been writing sed
                    scripts in the last few weeks. As I have some experience with sed, at
                    the moment I would prefer it. But if the job only needed to be done
                    once rather than repeatedly, a text editor would suffice.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo nodded and replied: <span>“<span>When you are hungry, eat;
                    when you are thirsty, drink; when you are tired,
                    sleep.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Upon hearing this, the novice was enlightened.</p>

        <p>There was a novice who learned much at the Master&#39;s feet, but felt
            something to be missing. After meditating on his doubts for some time,
            he found the courage to approach Master Foo about his problem.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Master Foo,</span>”</span> he asked <span>“<span>why do Unix users not
                    employ antivirus programs? And defragmentors? And malware
                    cleaners?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo smiled, and said <span>“<span>When your house is well
                    constructed, there is no need to add pillars to keep the roof in
                    place.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The novice replied <span>“<span>Would it not be better to use these
                    things anyway, just to be certain?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo reached for a nearby ball of string, and began wrapping it
            around the novice&#39;s feet.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>What are you doing?</span>”</span> the novice asked in surprise.</p>
        <p>Master Foo replied simply: <span>“<span>Tying your shoes.</span>”</span></p>

        </div>
        <p>A technical recruiter, having discovered that that the ways of
            Unix hackers were strange to him, sought an audience with Master Foo
            to learn more about the Way. Master Foo met the recruiter in the HR
            offices of a large firm.</p>
        <p>The recruiter said, <span>“<span>I have observed that Unix hackers scowl or
                    become annoyed when I ask them how many years of experience they have
                    in a new programming language. Why is this so?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo stood, and began to pace across the office floor.
            The recruiter was puzzled, and asked <span>“<span>What are you
                    doing?</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>I am learning to walk,</span>”</span> replied Master Foo.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>I saw you walk through that door</span>”</span> the recruiter
            exclaimed, <span>“<span>and you are not stumbling over your own feet.
                    Obviously you already know how to walk.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>Yes, but this floor is new to me.</span>”</span> replied Master Foo.

        <p>A student said: <span>“<span>We have learned that Unix is not just an
                    operating system, but also a style of approaching
                    problems.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo nodded in agreement.</p>
        <p>The student continued: <span>“<span>Then, the Great Way of Unix can be
                    applied on other operating systems?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo sat silent for a moment, then said: <span>“<span>In every
                    operating system there is a path to the Great Way, if only we can find
                    it.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The student continued: <span>“<span>What, then, of Windows? It is
                    preinstalled on most computers, and though its tools are mostly far
                    inferior, they are easy to use for beginners. Surely, Windows users
                    could benefit from the Unix philosophy.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo nodded again.</p>
        <p>The student said: <span>“<span>How, then, are those enlightened in the Unix Way
                    to return to the Windows world?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo said: <span>“<span>To return to Windows, you have but to
                    boot it up.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The student said, growing agitated: <span>“<span>Master Foo, if it is
                    so easy, why are there so many monolithic and broken software packages
                    for Windows? Elegant software should also be possible with a GUI and
                    fancy colors, but there is little evidence that this occurs. What
                    becomes of an enlighted one who returns to Windows?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo: <span>“<span>A broken mirror never reflects again; fallen flowers
                    never go back to the old branches.</span>”</span></p>

        </div>
        <p>A Unix zealot, having heard that Master Foo was wise in the
            Great Way, came to him for instruction. Master Foo said to him:</p>
        <p><span>“<span>When the Patriarch Thompson invented Unix, he did not
                    understand it. Then he gained in understanding, and no longer invented
                    it.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>When the Patriarch McIlroy invented the pipe, he knew
                    that it would transform software, but did not know that it would
                    transform mind.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>When the Patriarch Ritchie invented C, he condemned
                    programmers to a thousand hells of buffer overruns, heap corruption,
                    and stale-pointer bugs.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>Truly, the Patriarchs were blind and foolish!</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The zealot was greatly angered by the Master&#39;s words.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>These enlightened ones,</span>”</span> he protested, <span>“<span>gave
                    us the Great Way of Unix. Surely, if we mock them we will lose merit
                    and be reborn as beasts or MCSEs.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>Is your code ever completely without stain and
                    flaw?</span>”</span> demanded Master Foo.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>No,</span>”</span> admitted the zealot, <span>“<span>no man&#39;s

        <p><span>“<span>The wisdom of the Patriarchs</span>”</span> said Master Foo,

        <p>Master Foo nodded.</p>

        <p>Master Foo nodded.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>How can this be?</span>”</span> asked the student.</p>
        <p>Master Foo replied:</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Novell indeed has dominion over the code of Unix, but the
                    code of Unix is not Unix. OpenGroup indeed has dominion over the name
                    of Unix, but the name of Unix is not Unix.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>What, then, is the Unix-nature?</span>”</span> asked the student.
        </p>
        <p>Master Foo replied:</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Not code. Not name. Not mind. Not things. Always changing,
                    yet never changing.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>The Unix-nature is simple and empty. Because it is
                    simple and empty, it is more powerful than a typhoon.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>Moving in accordance with the law of nature, it unfolds
                    inexorably in the minds of programmers, assimilating designs to its
                    own nature. All software that would compete with it must become
                    like to it; empty, empty, profoundly empty, perfectly void,
                    hail!</span>”</span></p>

        <p>Once, a famous Windows system administrator came to Master Foo
            and asked him for instruction: <span>“<span>I have heard that you are a
                    powerful Unix wizard. Let us trade secrets, that we may both gain
                    thereby.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo said: <span>“<span>It is good that you seek wisdom. But in
                    the Way of Unix, there are no secrets.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The administrator looked puzzled at this. <span>“<span>But it is said
                    that you are a great Unix guru who knows all the innermost mysteries.
                    As do I in Windows; I am an MCSE, and I have many other certifications
                    of knowledge not common in the world. I know even the most obscure
                    registry entries by heart. I can tell you everything about the Windows
                    API, yes, even secrets those of Redmond have half-forgotten. What is
                    the arcane lore that gives you your power?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo said: <span>“<span>I have none. Nothing is hidden, nothing
                    is revealed.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Growing angry, the administrator said <span>“<span>Very well, if you
                    hold no secrets, then tell me: what do I have to know to become as
                    powerful in the Unix way as you?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo said: <span>“<span>A man who mistakes secrets for knowledge
                    is like a man who, seeking light, hugs a candle so closely that he
                    smothers it and burns his hand.</span>”</span></p>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>On another occasion when Master Foo gave public instruction, an
            end user, having heard tales of the Master&#39;s wisdom, came to him for
            guidance.</p>
        <p>He bowed three times to Master Foo. <span>“<span>I wish to learn the
                    Great Way of Unix,</span>”</span> he said <span>“<span>but the command
                    line
                    confuses me.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Some of the onlooking neophytes began to mock the end user,
            calling him <span>“<span>clueless</span>”</span> and saying that the Way of
            Unix is only for those of discipline and intelligence.</p>
        <p>The Master held up a hand for silence, and called the most
            obstreperous of the neophytes who had mocked forward, to where
            he and the end user sat.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>Tell me,</span>”</span> he asked the neophyte, <span>“<span>of the
                    code you have written and the works of design you have
                    uttered.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The neophyte began to stammer out a reply, but fell silent.</p>
        <p>Master Foo turned to the end-user. <span>“<span>Tell me,</span>”</span> he
            inquired, <span>“<span>why do you seek the Way?</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>I am discontent with the software I see around
                    me,</span>”</span> the end user replied. <span>“<span>It neither
                    performs reliably
                    nor pleases the eye and hand. Having heard that the Unix way, though
                    difficult, is superior, I seek to cast aside all snares and
                    delusions.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>And what do you do in the world,</span>”</span> asked Master Foo,
            <span>“<span>that you must strive with software?</span>”</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>“<span>I am a builder,</span>”</span> the end user replied, <span>“<span>Many
                    of the houses of this town were made under my chop.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo turned back to the neophyte. <span>“<span>The housecat may
                    mock the tiger,</span>”</span> said the master, <span>“<span>but doing
                    so will not
                    make his purr into a roar.</span>”</span></p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>There was a time when rumors began to reach Master Foo and his students
            of a prodigiously gifted programmer, a young man who wandered the length and
            breadth of the land performing mighty feats of coding and humiliating all
            who dared set their skill against his.</p>
        <p>Eventually this prodigy came to visit Master Foo, who received him
            politely and offered him tea. The Prodigy accepted with equal politeness
            and explained the motive for his visit.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>I have come to you,</span>”</span> he said <span>“<span>seeking a code
                    and design review of my latest project. For it is of surpassing
                    complexity, and I do not have peers capable of understanding it. Only
                    an acknowledged master such as yourself (and here the Prodigy bowed
                    deeply) can have the discernment required.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo bowed politely in return and began examining the
            Prodigy&#39;s code. After some time he raised his eyes from the screen.
            <span>“<span>This code is at first sight very impressive,</span>”</span> he
            said. <span>“<span>It is elegant in design, utilizing original algorithms of
                    great ingenuity, and appears to be implemented in a craftsmanlike way
                    which minimizes the possibility of errors.</span>”</span>
        </p>
        <p>The Prodigy looked very pleased at this praise, but Master Foo
            continued: <span>“<span>However, I detect one significant flaw.</span>”</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>“<span>Flaw?</span>”</span> the Prodigy said. <span>“<span>What
                    flaw?</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>This code is difficult to read,</span>”</span> said Master
            Foo. <span>“<span>It is only thinly commented, its invariants are not
                    specified, and I see no narrative description of its architecture or
                    internal data structures anywhere. These problems will seriously
                    impede your cooperation with other programmers.</span>”</span></p>
        <p>The Prodigy drew himself up haughtily. <span>“<span>I do not seek the
                    cooperation of other programmers,</span>”</span> he said. <span>“<span>Every
                    time I
                    thought I had found one who might match me in skill I have been
                    disappointed. Thus, I work alone.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>But even the hacker who works alone,</span>”</span> said Master
            Foo, <span>“<span>collaborates with others, and must constantly communicate
                    clearly to them, lest his work become confused and lost.</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>Of what others do you speak?</span>”</span> the Prodigy demanded.
        </p>
        <p>Master Foo said: <span>“<span>All your future selves.</span>”</span></p>

        <p>On one occasion, as Master Foo was traveling to a conference with a
            few of his senior disciples, he was accosted by a hardware designer.</p>
        <p>The hardware designer said: <span>“<span>It is rumored that you are a
                    great programmer. How many lines of code do you write per
                    year?</span>”</span></p>
        <p>Master Foo replied with a question: <span>“<span>How many square
                    inches of silicon do you lay out per year?</span>”</span></p>
        <p><span>“<span>Why...we hardware designers never measure our work in
                    that way,</span>”</span> the man said.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>And why not?</span>”</span> Master Foo inquired.</p>
        <p><span>“<span>If we did so,</span>”</span> the hardware designer replied,
            <span>“<span>we would be tempted to design chips so large that they cannot
                    be fabricated - and, if they were fabricated, their overwhelming
                    complexity would make it be impossible to generate proper test vectors
                    for them.</span>”</span>
        </p>
        <p>Master Foo smiled, and bowed to the hardware designer.</p>
        <p>In that moment, the hardware designer achieved enlightenment.</p>
