    <h1>Self-replicating Python using ChatGPT</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text">
<p dir="auto">This was a little experiment that I (Thomas) created.
My goal was a self sustaining program that could reproduce and mutate by using ChatGPT.
I wrote .gitignore, start.py, 0.py, and lib.py.</p>
<p dir="auto">The code is &#39;supposed&#39; to create a new file where the name is it&#39;s lineage.
0.py is the first, and 0.0.py is the first child of 0.py, 0.0.1 is the second child of 0.0.py etc.</p>
<p dir="auto">Requests to ChatGPT are concurrent within an execution of get_children, but because of how I used exec() only a single version can be running at once.</p>
<p dir="auto">It forms a tree, where if all of one version&#39;s children dies, then the next sibling (or aunt/uncle if the parent is exhausted too) is run.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to run this, I&#39;d strongly encourage setting a cap on your OpenAPI budget as this makes a lot of requests.</p>
