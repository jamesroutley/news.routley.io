And secondly … now they&#39;ve destroyed the piece of evidence.&#34;</p><p>Amazon repeatedly claimed it had shipped the correct item.  </p><p>Legault repeatedly explained he had received and returned &#34;a complete fake&#34; and attached photos to prove it. </p><p>Telling customers the item they&#39;ve returned has been disposed of is a great way for Amazon to &#34;end the conversation,&#34; said marketing specialist Marc Gordon, who coaches both small companies and big-name multinationals on interacting with customers. </p><div><figure><div><p><img loading="lazy" alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6669731.1669999362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_300/fake-graphics-card.jpg 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6669731.1669999362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_460/fake-graphics-card.jpg 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6669731.1669999362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/fake-graphics-card.jpg 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6669731.1669999362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/fake-graphics-card.jpg 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.6669731.1669999362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/fake-graphics-card.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.6669731.1669999362!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_780/fake-graphics-card.jpg"/></p></div><figcaption>The fake graphic card, filled with a putty-like substance to provide weight, that Matthew says arrived from Amazon. <!-- --> <!-- -->(Submitted by François Legault)</figcaption></figure></div><p>But &#34;that&#39;s impacting the quality of service they provide.&#34;</p><p>Service, Gordon says, may be affected as customers who flocked to the online retailer during the pandemic return to brick-and-mortar stores, forcing Amazon to re-organize.</p><p>&#34;They don&#39;t have the time or the resources to deal with every customer complaint, every inquiry, every problem,&#34; said Gordon. &#34;They want this done and they want to move on to something else.&#34;</p><p>In an email, Amazon&#39;s Canada spokesperson Ryma Boussoufa said: &#34;Not every returned product can or may legally be resold or donated for hygienic or product safety reasons.

But it was difficult to read the black hands on its black face, so he sent it back. </p><p>Amazon repeatedly told Papernick he had sent back an &#34;older model&#34; watch, which it had then discarded. It asked him to return the correct item. </p><p>&#34;If I was scamming them, then let them send that item back to me,&#34; he said. &#34;Getting rid of it is a weird business practice, to say the least.&#34;</p><p>He threatened to sue for $10,000 and received a full refund the next day. </p><p>Amazon did not answer when Go Public asked whether all outgoing packages are individually inspected to confirm the contents. But every returned item is carefully inspected &#34;to accurately determine its condition,&#34; according to Boussoufa, the spokesperson. </p><p>Other customers, like Justin Tabbert of Ottawa, say they will never again order from Amazon after similar, frustrating experiences.</p><p><em><strong>WATCH | What to do when your Amazon package arrives:</strong></em><span><span><div><div title="Advice from a customer experience expert" role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div title="Advice from a customer experience expert"><div><p><img srcset="

Have someone grab their phone and film when a package is opened.</p><p>&#34;If it&#39;s exactly what they ordered, great, they can delete the video,&#34; said Gordon. &#34;If it is, in fact, something that&#39;s been substituted or fake or fraudulent, well, it&#39;s right there in the video. There&#39;s no denying it.&#34;</p><p>As for Matthew Legault, the high school grad is happy his computer is up and running — he uses it to play games with friends and is learning how to write computer code. </p><p>His father says the Amazon dispute has taught him something, too.</p><p>&#34;This whole experience has really motivated me to shop local again,&#34; said  François. </p><p>Amazon has &#34;lost a lot of business from us.&#34;</p><div><h2>Submit your story ideas</h2><p>Go Public is an investigative news segment on CBC-TV, radio and the web.</p><p>We tell your stories, shed light on wrongdoing and hold the powers that be accountable.</p><p>If you have a story in the public interest, or if you&#39;re an insider with information, contact <a href="mailto:GoPublic@cbc.ca">GoPublic@cbc.ca</a> with your name, contact information and a brief summary.
