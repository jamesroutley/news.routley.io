<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tag/nikon" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tag/nikon">Nikon</a> has developed an innovative in-vehicle camera system in conjunction with Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation (MFTBC). The camera features an optical lens that captures both telephoto and wide-angle imagery simultaneously, enabling users to see far-away objects while checking their peripheral vision at the same time. The camera will be exhibited for the first time at the Consumer Electronics Show (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tag/ces" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/tag/ces">CES</a>) in Las Vegas, January 7-10, 2025.</p><p>The optical axes of the far-away and periphery shots are the same, which prevents the parallax effect. When used as an in-vehicle camera, AI systems can perform image recognition to collect road information that requires tracking, such as road signs or other vehicles in the distance. The dual-camera system reduces the issue of losing track of objects or seeing a double image.</p><p>When used as an in-vehicle camera, the integrated telephoto and wide-angle lens system will mean that fewer cameras have to be installed in the vehicle while still providing seamless 360-degree surround view coverage, offering the benefit of reducing system costs and failure rates.</p><p>The camera can be integrated into advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving technology, helping to enhance visibility and prevent serious accidents caused by drivers not seeing signs or pedestrians.</p><p>Nikon and MFTBC have been working together on the camera system since 2020, which is initially intended for use in trucks and buses. Nikon says that it is also exploring a variety of possibilities to expand the use of the technology not only in vehicles but also in other diverse fields.</p><p>While this futuristic tech isn&#39;t available yet, why not check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-dash-cam" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-dash-cam">best dash cams</a> that you can buy today…</p><div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-rpdb3f6kCE4nNiyX8EJ436"><div data-hydrate="true"><div><section></section><section><p>The best camera deals, reviews, product advice, and unmissable photography news, direct to your inbox!</p></section></div></div></div>
