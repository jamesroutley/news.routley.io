    <h1>Norway to fine Meta $98,500 a day over user privacy breach from 14 August</h1>

Datatilsynet can make it permanent by referring its decision to the European Data Protection Board, which has the power to do so, if it agrees with the Norwegian regulator’s decision.</p><p>That could also widen the decision’s territorial scope to the rest of Europe. Datatilsynet had yet to take this step.</p><p>Meta last week said it intends to ask users in the European Union for their consent before allowing businesses to target advertising based on what they view on its services such as Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Judin said that step was not enough. Meta had to stop the processing of personal data immediately and until that consent mechanism was up and running.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-11">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-11" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>“According to Meta, this will take several months, at the very earliest, for them to implement ... And we don’t know what the consent mechanism will look like,” Judin said. “And in the (meantime), peoples’ rights are being violated, every single day.”</p><p>Meta said the change was made to address regulatory requirements in the region and stems from an order in January by Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner, Meta’s lead EU regulator, to reassess the legal basis on how it targets ads.</p><p>Norway is not a member of the European Union but is part of the European single market.</p></div></div></div>
