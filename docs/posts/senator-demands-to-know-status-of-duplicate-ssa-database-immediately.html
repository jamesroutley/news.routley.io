    <h1>Senator demands to know status of &#39;duplicate&#39; SSA database &#39;immediately&#39;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A US Senator is demanding answers after a Social Security Administration (SSA) employee who blew the whistle on Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) dealings involuntarily resigned last month, citing workplace hostility in response to his concerns. </p>
<p>Republican Senator Mike Crapo (it&#39;s pronounced Cray-poe), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent a <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/crapo-requests-information-on-social-security-data-protections" rel="nofollow">letter</a> to the SSA&#39;s commissioner, Frank Bisignano, giving him just two weeks to provide answers to <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/whistleblower_accuses_doge_of_duplicating/">concerns raised last month</a> by now-former SSA Chief Data Officer Charles Borges. The former CDO&#39;s whistleblower complaint alleged DOGE had duplicated a critical database filled with taxpayer information, known as Numident, to a test cloud environment that wasn&#39;t managed by Borges or SSA, and which allegedly is without any oversight controls.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, I must take very seriously every allegation made by a protected whistleblower ... I consider the protection and security of PII held by the agency to be a matter of first importance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Numident is used to store records of every person who has ever applied for a Social Security Card in the United States. </p>
<p>Crapo&#39;s questions are numerous, but one with a much shorter deadline stands out: He wants to know whether that duplicate database &#34;was accessed, leaked, hacked, or disseminated in any unauthorized fashion,&#34; and he wants it &#34;immediately upon receipt of this letter.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, I must take very seriously every allegation made by a protected whistleblower,&#34; Crapo added. &#34;Further, given the large amount of sensitive data under SSA&#39;s control, I consider the protection and security of PII held by the agency to be a matter of first importance.&#34;</p>

    

<p>The SSA didn&#39;t directly answer questions about its response to Crapo, instead sending us an identical statement to the one it provided when we covered the original whistleblower complaint last month. </p>

        


        

<p>&#34;We are not aware of any compromise to this environment and remain dedicated to protecting sensitive personal data,&#34; an SSA spokesperson said, while maintaining that Numident data is stored &#34;in secure environments that have robust safeguards in place to protect vital information.&#34; That doesn&#39;t explain the security of the alleged unauthorized copy of Numident. We pointed this out to the SSA, but haven&#39;t heard back.</p>
<p>Borges&#39; complaint was primarily about the Numident copy, but he also raised concerns over his beliefs that DOGE had allegedly committed numerous &#34;systemic data security violations&#34; as well as violations of SSA protocols and federal data privacy laws in its time at the SSA. </p>

</ul>
<p>In response to his concerns, Borges said in his <a href="https://whistleblower.org/press/social-security-whistleblower-resigns-after-revealing-millions-of-americans-data-was-put-at-risk/" rel="nofollow">resignation letter</a> late last month that SSA&#39;s actions created a hostile work environment that made it impossible for him to fulfill his duties ethically or lawfully, caused significant distress, and effectively forced him from his role as chief data officer.</p>
<p>&#34;After reporting internally to management and externally to regulators serious data security and integrity concerns impacting our citizens&#39; most sensitive personal data, I have suffered exclusion, isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear, creating a hostile work environment and making work conditions intolerable,&#34; Borges wrote in his letter to Bisignano. &#34;SSA&#39;s actions against me [have made] my duties impossible to perform legally and ethically.&#34; </p>

        

<p>In addition to his demand for answers about the integrity of the alleged Numident duplicate, Crapo is also demanding to know how SSA dealt with Borges&#39; internal complaints, details about its use of cloud storage and data security mechanisms, and asks about how it assessed the risk of giving agency employees the ability &#34;to transfer data from the Numident database to a private cloud within SSA&#39;s AWS cloud environment.&#34; </p>
<p>Neither Crapo&#39;s office nor the Senate Finance Committee responded to questions for this story. ®</p>
