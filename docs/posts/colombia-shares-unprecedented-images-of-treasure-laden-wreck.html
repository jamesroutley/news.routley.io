</div><p>Colombia&#39;s army has shared unprecedented images of the legendary San Jose galleon shipwreck, hidden underwater for three centuries and believed to have been carrying riches worth billions of dollars in today&#39;s money.

                                                                                    <p>Four observation missions using a remotely operated vehicle were sent to the wreck at a depth of almost 950 meters (3,100 feet) off Colombia&#39;s Caribbean coast, the army said in a statement late Monday.</p>
<p>These missions, carried out by the navy under the supervision of the culture ministry, found the galleon untouched by &#34;<a href="https://phys.org/tags/human+intervention/" rel="tag">human intervention</a>.&#34;</p>
<p>Cannons partially covered by mud are visible alongside porcelain crockery, pottery, glass bottles and also gold pieces.</p>
<p>A part of the bow can be clearly seen covered in algae and shellfish, as well as the remains of the frame of the hull.</p>
<p>Authorities said they had also discovered two more shipwrecks during their observation mission—a colonial-era galleon and a schooner from the post-colonial period.</p>
<p>&#34;Thanks to the technological equipment and the Colombian navy&#39;s work, we managed to capture images with a level of precision that&#39;s never been seen before,&#34; said President Ivan Duque.</p>
<p>He said the wreck was &#34;kept intact and protected with a view towards a future retrieval.&#34;</p>
<p>When that happens, though, Colombia will face a challenge from Spain and an indigenous group in Bolivia to determine who keeps the bounty.</p>

<p><b>Lost for 300 years</b></p>
<p>The San Jose galleon was owned by the Spanish crown when it was sunk by the British navy near Cartagena in 1708.</p>
<p>Only a handful of its 600-strong crew survived.</p>
<p>It was heading back from the New World to the court of King Philip V of Spain.</p>
<p>At the time, it was laden with treasures estimated to be worth billions of dollars at current rates.</p>

<p>Before its discovery in 2015, it was long sought after by <a href="https://phys.org/tags/treasure+hunters/" rel="tag">treasure hunters</a>.</p>
<p>Experts believe it contains at least 200 tons of gold, silver and emeralds.</p>
<p>Colombia considers wrecks found in its <a href="https://phys.org/tags/territorial+waters/" rel="tag">territorial waters</a> to be part of its cultural heritage, meaning the contents cannot be sold.</p>
<p>Spain insists that the bounty is theirs since it was aboard a Spanish ship, while Bolivia&#39;s Qhara Qhara nation says it should get the treasures as the Spanish forced the community&#39;s people to mine the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/precious+metals/" rel="tag">precious metals</a>.</p>
<p>When the wreck was discovered, then Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos lauded it as &#34;the most precious treasure ever found in the history of the world.&#34;</p>

<p>He had proposed to finance the recovery mission with the proceeds from selling part of the find, but Duque put a stop to that to ensure the entirety of the wreck would remain in Colombia.</p>
<p>Colombian authorities have announced their intention to create a museum of shipwrecks that would be &#34;a source of pride for Colombia, the Caribbean and the world.&#34;</p>
<p>Recovering the <a href="https://phys.org/tags/wreck/" rel="tag">wreck</a> presents a technological and scientific challenge due to its depth.</p>
<p>Authorities have identified another 13 sites off the coast of Cartagena that they want to explore in search of other shipwrecks.
