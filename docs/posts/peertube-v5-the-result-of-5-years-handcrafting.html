<h2>Five years of shaping PeerTube by hand</h2>
<p>For the past 5 years, our only developer dedicated to PeerTube (and to other tasks in Framasoft) has released one new major version per year :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://framablog.org/2018/10/15/peertube-1-0-the-free-libre-and-federated-video-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PeerTube v1</a> (Oct. 2018) allows you to create a video platform with federation, peer-to-peer streaming, redundancy, search tools and multilingual interface.</li>
<li><a href="https://framablog.org/2019/11/12/peertube-has-worked-twice-as-hard-to-free-your-videos-from-youtube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PeerTube v2</a> (Nov 2019) brings notifications, playlists and plugins.</li>
<li><a href="https://framablog.org/2021/01/07/peertube-v3-its-a-live-a-liiiiive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PeerTube v3</a> (Jan. 2021) adds federated search, live and peer-to-peer streaming.</li>
<li><a href="https://framablog.org/2021/11/30/peertube-v4-more-power-to-help-you-present-your-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PeerTube v4</a> (Dec. 2021) allows to customise each platform’s homepage, to sort and filter displayed videos, and to manage them more easily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout these years, <strong>this developer has taken care to improve moderation and federation tools, the video player, the interface, the code and the accessibility</strong> and also to fix bugs while answering community questions and needs.</p>
<h2>PeerTube ecosytem</h2>
<p>PeerTube is an artisanal work, in the noble sense of the word. It is <strong>a handcrafted tool that now serves a large alternative ecosystem for online video</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sepiasearch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SepiaSearch</a>, a Search Engine of PeerTube content</li>
<li>Communication tools :
<ul>
<li>a <a href="https://framacolibri.org/c/peertube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support forum</a></li>
<li>a <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/news#newsletter-email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newsletter</a> (also published on JoinPeerTube)</li>
<li>a <a href="https://twitter.com/joinpeertube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter account</a></li>
<li>a <a href="https://framapiaf.org/@peertube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastodon account</a></li>
<li>a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PeerTube/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monitoring on reddit</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2 crowdfundings to avoid PeerTube to be only financed by donations from French speaking people</li>
<li><a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Improve PeerTube</a>, a website to suggest or vote for ideas or improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, we would like to remind you that <strong>our small non-profit creates and maintains all this with only one developer on the project</strong>, helped by :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Framasoft employees and volunteers</strong> for communication, strategy, administration ;</li>
<li><strong>PeerTube community</strong> which regularly contributes to code, plugins, translations, suggestions, sharing and donations (thanks and lots of datalove to you &lt;3) ;</li>
<li><strong>Service providers</strong> in specialized areas (UX or UI design, accessibility, creation of mobile applications, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>However PeerTube is only one of dozens of projects we maintain at Framasoft, even though it is one of the largest.</p>
<p>Like every thing we do, <strong>PeerTube is mainly funded by your donations</strong> (and donations from foundations like NLnet).</p>

<h2>A year of work to make PeerTube easier to use</h2>
<p>Since the beginning of 2022, we have been working on PeerTube t<strong>o make it easier and easier to use for videomakers and their communities</strong>.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/news#release-4.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 4.1</a> brings several expected improvements : of the interface, of the video player on mobile devices, of the plugin system, of the search filters or of the instance customization.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/news#release-4.2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 4.2</a> introduces two major new features : the Studio, for light video editing directly from PeerTube ; and replay publication for « Twitch-like » live streams. Other new features include detailed video statistics, latency management for live streaming and subtitle editing directly from the interface.</p>
<p>In September, with <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/news#release-4.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">version 4.3</a>, you can now automate video import from a YouTube (or Vimeo) channel. We have also completely reworked the interface for creating a PeerTube account and improved the live streams display on external website.</p>

<h2>PeerTube v5 : improving and securing to empower yourself better</h2>
<p>It’s now December 2022, and <a href="https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PeerTube v5 is now available</strong></a> ! This version enhances security in several ways.</p>
<p>The file system has been redesigned to <strong>secure internal and private videos</strong>. This was a fairly complex work that lays a basis for some much asked future features.</p>
<p>Another very emancipating technical improvement is the <strong>possibility of storing live streams in the cloud</strong>, with « object storage » system. This means that PeerTube platforms hosted on a server with limited disk storage and bandwidth are no longer limited in their ability to offer live streams.</p>
<p>It is now possible to <strong>use two-factor authentication</strong> to connect to a PeerTube platform. We use the OTP (One Time Password) method which allows, via an external application, to generate a unique code to validate the connection to its account.</p>
<p>This new version also comes with a lot of <strong>bug fixes and improvements</strong>. For example, we have added more possibilities to the API, so that PeerTube contributors can develop even more powerful plugins.</p>
<p>Also, the PeerTube interface has received many changes. For example, in the <em><strong>My Videos</strong></em> menu now displays channels, and a mention of the playlist in which a video has been added to.</p>
<p>Finally, we have now a <strong>detailed <a href="https://docs.joinpeertube.org/maintain-observability" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenTelemetry documentation</a></strong> (feature released in version 4.2) which brings advanced statistics and observability.</p>
<h2>Support, intern, technical challenges and questions on our horizon</h2>
<p>Right now, we only have a clear vision for the near future of PeerTube.</p>

<p>This year again, we have supported <a href="https://github.com/JohnXLivingston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Livingston</a>‘s work on <a href="https://github.com/JohnXLivingston/peertube-plugin-livechat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>PeerTube Live Chat plugin</strong></a>, and we can announce that the easy plugin set-up is coming very soon !</p>
<p>In early 2023, we plan to work on a rather technical but very exciting feature, which should <strong>reduce the servers’ load</strong> and thus to lower the power needed to create a PeerTube platform : we’ll tell you more as soon as we’ve made progress.</p>
<p>Also in 2023, we will <strong>welcome a developer intern</strong>. We want more and more people to become familiar with PeerTube core code. We want to expermient with temporarily expanding the team working on it.</p>
<p>Finally, the day after this article is published, we will answer all your questions on reddit. <strong>Join us on December 14th at 4pm (CEST) on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource" target="_blank" rel="noopener">r/opensource</a> for an AMA (Ask Me Anything) about PeerTube and Framasoft !</strong></p>
<p> <a href="https://soutenir.framasoft.org">Support PeerTube by donating to Framasoft</a></p>
<h2>Share your ideas for PeerTube v6 !</h2>
<p>These few points aside… we have no idea what the PeerTube roadmap will be in 2023. We need you to help us define it !</p>
<p>Please <strong>go to <a href="https://ideas.joinpeertube.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Let’s Improve PeerTube</a> and publish your ideas</strong> (and vote for the ones you’re excited about). We want to know what the PeerTube community needs and wants, especially the « non-geek » audience who doesn’ t care about words like « server » or « instance » and just want to watch and share videos.</p>

<p>In early 2023, we will go through the most popular suggestions and <strong>select those that fit our vision for PeerTube</strong> and our development capabilities, in order to build the PeerTube v6 roadmap.</p>
<p>So it’s up to you to tell us what future you want for PeerTube !</p>
<h2>An international tool…</h2>
<p>This year, we were lucky enough to have two development contracts that helped us to fund some of our work on PeerTube.</p>
<p>The French Ministry of Education funded <strong>the Studio</strong> (a tool for editing videos) to be implemented on its platform <a href="https://apps.education.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apps.education.fr</a> (a free-libre service platform provided by the Ministry to all teachers and staff).</p>
<p><a href="https://howlround.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Howlround</a>, a Boston-based open platform for theatremakers worldwide, funded detailed video and live stats, but also replay feature for permanent lives.</p>
<p>Finally, we received an exceptional grant from the Dutch foundation <a href="https://nlnet.nl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NLnet</a> to work on PeerTube v5.</p>
<h2>…funded by French-speaking donations</h2>
<p>Put together, these amounts represent a small half of our annual budget dedicated to PeerTube (which we estimate at 70 000 €). The other part comes from Framasoft’s budget, i.e. from the donations that our non profit receives from its mainly French-speaking community. To us, <strong>it seems almost unfair that it is mainly French speakers who finance a tool that has a truly international scope</strong>…</p>
<p>But here’s the thing : we’re already not very good at « selling ourselves », promoting our work and getting donations, so if we have to do international marketing, we’re not out of the woods !</p>
<p>We don’t have a marketing department : we only have you.</p>
<p><b>So we need your help</b>. Spread the word about our donation campaign around you, especially outside the French-speaking world.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to share the address <a href="https://support.joinpeertube.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support.joinpeertube.org</a> around you, on your PeerTube platforms, in your communities that benefit from this alternative.</p>
<p><a href="https://soutenir.framasoft.org/en/"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://framablog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bandeau-dons-EN-1024x518.png" alt="" width="1024" height="518" srcset="https://framablog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bandeau-dons-EN-1024x518.png 1024w, https://framablog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bandeau-dons-EN-300x152.png 300w, https://framablog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bandeau-dons-EN-768x389.png 768w, https://framablog.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bandeau-dons-EN.png 1279w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"/></a></p>
<p>At the time of publishing, we are still missing 115 000 € to finance our yearly budget and make everything we want to do in 2023 happen.</p>
<p>If you can (especially in these hard times) and if you want to, thanks for supporting our non-profit and our actions.</p>
