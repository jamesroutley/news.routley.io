    <h1>Arm IPO to kick off today with company valued at $54.5B</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The long anticipated Arm flotation is set to kick off today with shares being offered to the public at $51 apiece, putting a value on the company of $54.5 billion.</p>
<p>Britain&#39;s chip design and licensing outfit said in a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arm.com/company/news/2023/09/arm-announces-pricing-of-initial-public-offering">statement</a> that its shares are expected to begin trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in New York on September 14 under the symbol ARM.</p>
<p>There has already been huge interest in this IPO, which resulted in Arm closing orders for shares a day earlier than planned this week due to its stock being more than five times oversubscribed, according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/3bc383db-a0c2-4e30-81c4-d09a185605c2">Financial Times</a>. This interest could push the share price higher than the initial $51 once trading begins.</p>

    

<p>At this price, the IPO is reportedly set to raise about $4.9 billion for Arm’s parent company, Softbank, which is less than the $8-$10 billion the Japanese investment outfit had previously said it hoped to generate. Softbank itself <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/1dd470c2-be80-4887-83cc-87be93100a12">posted</a> a record $39 billion loss earlier this year.</p>

        


        

<p>Arm will continue to remain under the control of Softbank after the stock sell off, however, as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/01/arm_ipo_confirmed/">reported</a> by <em>The Register</em> earlier this year when the chip designer first filed for its public listing. Softbank issued a statement saying that: &#34;SBG (Softbank) intends that Arm will continue to be a consolidated subsidiary of SBG following the completion of the proposed initial public offering.&#34;</p>
<p>The valuation of Arm at $54.5 billion is also lower than the $60-$70 billion that Softbank was said to be aiming for, a figure based on the estimated value of the proposed sale of Arm to GPU maker Nvidia at the time <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/08/arm_cancels_sale_to_nvidia/">the deal fell through</a> last year. It is still likely to make it the largest IPO in the US this year, however.</p>

        

<p>That proposed sale fell through due to the &#34;significant regulatory challenges&#34; it faced from authorities in various countries, as well as opposition from other tech companies who feared that Nvidia might limit access to Arm technology for other licensees.</p>
<p>The IPO has instead generally met with broad approval, with many big names in the industry such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/08/09/softbank_q1_2023_arm_ipo/">Apple, Samsung, and Intel</a> stepping up to take a sizable stake in the Brit chip company.</p>

</ul>
<p>This is one reason why the UK government was hopeful that the IPO might be a dual-listing, with Arm shares going up for sale on the London stock exchange as well as New York. Those <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/06/fca_rules_arm_listing/">hopes were dashed</a> earlier this year, when the company confirmed it would list only in the US, blamed by some on financial red tape.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Markets/IPO/SoftBank-puts-stamp-on-Arm-IPO-as-Mizuho-wins-top-underwriter-spot">Nikkei Asia</a>, the IPO has four lead underwriters, comprising Barclays, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Mizuho USA. There is also a second tier of banks, including Bank of America and Citigroup. ®</p>
