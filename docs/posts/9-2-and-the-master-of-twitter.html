    <p>I woke up yesterday to the headlines: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/04/investing/elon-musk-twitter-shares-stake/index.html">Elon Musk buys 9.2% stake in Twitter</a>, making him the largest shareholder.

Elon Nation voted &#8220;Yes, sell your shares!&#8221;, and Elon obliged and started selling on November 8th, selling $16 billion over the next six seeks.</p><p>So that seems pretty crazy in itself, and Musk was apparently subpoenaed by the SEC about the tweet<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-elon-musk-subpoena-sec-twitter-poll-2018-settlement-tweets-2022-2"> just 10 days later</a>. But it gets so much better. The day before Elon tweeted the poll, it turns out his brother Kimbal<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/elon-kimbal-musk-insider-trading-investigation-may-be-tough-to-pursue.html"> made his biggest ever share sale</a> (15% of his total holdings) at $1,229 a share.</p><p>The SEC is<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-probes-trading-by-elon-musk-and-brother-in-wake-of-tesla-ceos-sales-11645730528"> reportedly investigating</a> whether this sale could constitute insider trading, because, well, timing. Musk <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3c4a8031-b2a5-42ea-a763-4b5b8afd5164">told the FT</a> that &#8220;Kimbal had no idea I was going to do a Twitter poll&#8221; and this was &#8220;simply more evidence of Stevie grinding his very tiny axe yet again&#8221; referring to the SEC&#8217;s Steven Buchholz.</p><h1><strong>Why escalate?</strong></h1><p>It was in February that things started really escalating. </p><p><strong>February 7th, 2022</strong>: Tesla <a href="https://fortune.com/2022/02/07/tesla-subpoena-sec-elon-musk-settlement/">disclosed</a> they had received the subpoena about the November poll. </p><p><strong>February 17th, 2022</strong>: Musk and his lawyer sent a letter to the &#8216;reasonableness pants&#8217; judge saying the SEC<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/22/22946117/elon-musk-sec-accuse-leak-information-tesla"> was subjecting them</a> to endless harassment and leaking of investigative information.</p><p><strong>February 22nd, 2022</strong>: Elon <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1496088614501072896">tweets</a> about the SEC being corrupt.</p><p><strong>March 8th, 2022</strong>: Musk went even further, filing a motion asking to have the original 2018 settlement thrown out<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/03/08/musk-sec-agreement/"> because he was &#8216;forced&#8217; into it</a>, it was chilling his freedom of expression and other bad things.</p><p>Okay, that was a lot of info above, and I&#8217;m sure most of you have followed Elon vs. the SEC in some capacity. But I think the timeline context is important to understand where we are today. </p><p>The most important question for me - <strong>Why did Musk start escalating in February?</strong> </p><p>The SEC had treated the 2018 settlement with kid gloves so why force their hand? Yes, there was a new insider trading investigation and some subpoenas, but why push this fight? Since the 2018 settlement, amidst that status quo detente, TSLA is up nearly 1750% and Tesla, the business, feels like it&#8217;s at its most stable operating performance ever. Why choose this moment to mess with the very circumstances that drove some of the greatest wealth creation in human history?</p><p>I had the chance to speak about this entire drama on March 10th on TechCheck - around the 3:05 mark in the video I laid three potential ways this could play out.</p><ul><li><p>The SEC could fight tooth and nail just to maintain the status quo where they were not really regulating him. This seemed unlikely. </p></li><li><p>The SEC could agree the original settlement is void and then go after him over every single tweet since (even the original 420 tweet). This seemed most likely.</p></li><li><p>The most extreme possibility I saw was the SEC could try to get Elon Musk kicked off of Twitter.</p></li></ul><div id="youtube2-U2G8ul8iHLE" class="youtube-wrap" data-attrs="{&quot;videoId&quot;:&quot;U2G8ul8iHLE&quot;,&quot;startTime&quot;:&quot;16s&quot;,&quot;endTime&quot;:null}"><iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U2G8ul8iHLE?start=16s&amp;rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" gesture="media" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowautoplay="true" allowfullscreen="true" width="728" height="409"></iframe></div><p>I know, it sounds ridiculous that the SEC could try to stop Musk from tweeting at all.</p><p>But if someone uses their personal Twitter account to repeatedly break securities laws, it doesn&#8217;t seem too crazy that the SEC could force that person to stop tweeting. If someone specifically created a legally binding arrangement with the SEC, and then repeatedly violated that arrangement in order to break securities laws, it doesn&#8217;t seem like a 1st amendment issue if they lose their privilege to tweet. If someone&#8217;s personal account is inextricably linked to the company they run and are the face of, and they use that personal account to market their own company to the point they do not spend on marketing or have a PR department, it seems like that personal account is a significant asset and extension of the company.</p><p>But this is Elon and it&#8217;s 2022. </p><p>Something has been up since mid-February, and Elon was very methodically escalating things. </p><p>The title of the above segment was &#8220;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G8ul8iHLE&amp;t=16s">If anyone could steamroll the SEC, it would be Elon Musk, the master of Twitter</a>&#8221; as those words did come out of my mouth because I&#8217;d never discount Musk&#8217;s ability to play this game. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been even more intrigued why he&#8217;s escalated things.

Nothing, absolutely nothing, matters.</p><h2><strong>Why buy?</strong></h2><p>One more time, quickly, let&#8217;s review the timeline:</p><p><strong>Sept 2018 - Feb 2022</strong>: Musk periodically and quietly spars with the SEC while Tesla becomes one of the most valuable companies in the world. Elon is named Greatest Person to Ever Live in the Universe by TIME, the FT, and every other publication.</p><p><strong>Feb 7th - March 8th, 2022: </strong>Musk goes public. Letters, court filings, court filings that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/03/business/elon-musk-eminem-lawyer-sec/index.html">include Eminem lyrics</a>, and a full-on assault. He&#8217;s forcing the SEC&#8217;s hand.</p><p><strong>March 14th, 2022</strong>: Musk had accumulated at least half his position in TWTR by mid-March meaning, <strong>at the exact time he escalated his battle with the SEC over.....his ability to tweet&#8230;..he had already decided to become the largest shareholder in Twitter.</strong></p><p><strong>April 4th, 2022</strong>: We find out Musk, who has never held big equity position in a company he doesn&#8217;t own, has accumulated a 9.2% position in Twitter. </p><p>I get it - this entire thing could be as simple as<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-04-04/elon-musk-bought-some-twitter"> Matt Levine put it</a>: </p><blockquote><p>&#8220;He bought 9.2% of Twitter because he <em>has money</em>, and wants to <em>spend</em> some of it on <em>being more annoying on Twitter</em>.&#8221; </p></blockquote><p>Given how much Elon loves and is the master of tweeting, this is not implausible. But maybe it&#8217;s both about the lulz and legal jiujitsu. Imagine in mid-February, as Musk decides he wants to bring the fight head-on about his right to tweet, someone tosses out the idea &#8220;why don&#8217;t you just buy Twitter?&#8221; Everyone laughs and then he does it. It is the shitpost to end all shitposts. No one will ever outdo this.</p><p>And for a thought experiment, imagine there is a video of Elon telling Kimbal on Nov 5th &#8220;you should sell your shares because we are going to commit securities fraud and I am going to push the value down of this company over the next month&#8221; and the SEC finally gets real about going after him. Now picture you&#8217;re in the room with Twitter&#8217;s Safety and Security team. They&#8217;ve just received instructions from the SEC about restricting the account of the guy who is the biggest shareholder in their company and is on their board (and has no qualms about going after<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-tesla-asked-law-firm-to-fire-associate-hired-from-sec-11642265007"> those who financially cross him)</a>.</p><p>It kind of feels like Elon Musk might&#8217;ve just solved his entire SEC problem for $2.9 billion. How does the SEC go after his ability to tweet when he....owns Twitter? </p><h2><strong>Why this matters?</strong></h2><p>Nothing matters anymore, but this kind of does. It&#8217;s like a real-time view into the shit-postification of our financial markets. </p><p>For the first time forever I was interested in TWTR the stock. It finally felt like they got their shit together. They nailed it with Spaces, they&#8217;re pushing hard on newsletters, communities, even their shopping product might be something. How quickly they reversed <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-reverses-course-swipe-timeline#:~:text=Reversing%20into%20reverse%2Dchronological%20order.&amp;text=Twitter%20just%20thought%20better%20of,between%20Latest%20and%20Home%20timelines.">the reverse chrono</a> debacle showed they&#8217;re finally responsive. It&#8217;s almost like they&#8217;re a real company! </p><p>Now the CEO of Twitter is shitposting alongside Elon. Did Parag know about the 13D vs 13G thing when appointing Musk to the board and is also yelling &#8220;S Elon&#8217;s C&#8221;? Will there really be an edit button or is this a joke? This was a good company with a straightforward business that looked like it might execute on a turnaround. Now the stock is up 30% since Musk&#8217;s filing was disclosed and it lives beyond the realm of any kind of rational analysis. Now we just speculate on what Elon and Parag might do next and laugh.</p><p>It&#8217;s wild to think about. The U.S. government regulator has been in a fight with the world&#8217;s richest man over his ability to use a communications platform that&#8217;s vital to his business interests - and he just went and effectively bought the platform. Both Can and I have repeatedly written about<a href="https://www.readmargins.com/p/game-stop?s=w"> the emerging market-ification of the U.S.</a>, and this really feels like another one of those moments where we look back on and remember how we all posted memes as it happened.</p>
