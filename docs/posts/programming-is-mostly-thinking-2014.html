    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4896867988576448796" itemprop="description articleBody">

<blockquote>
<span><br/></span><span>Pretend you have a really great programming day.</span> </blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span>You only have to attend a few meetings, have only a few off-topic conversations, don&#39;t get distracted or interrupted much, don&#39;t have to do a bunch of status or time reporting, and you put in a good six hours of serious programming [note: this RARELY happens in an 8-10 hour day].</span> </blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span>I want to review your work in the morning, so I print out a diff of your day&#39;s work before going home.</span> </blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span>Sadly, overnight the version control system crashes and they have to recover from the previous day&#39;s backup. You have lost an entire day&#39;s work.</span> </blockquote>
<blockquote>
<span>If I give you the diff, how long will it take you to type the changes back into the code base and recover your six-hours&#39; work? </span></blockquote>
</div><h3>The Meaning Behind the Answer</h3><p>Right now I suspect a bunch of managers are about to go yell at their programmers for putting in a half-hour&#39;s work in an 8-hour day! That would be a horrible misunderstanding of what was actually happening.</p>
