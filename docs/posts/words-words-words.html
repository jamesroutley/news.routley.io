I&#8217;m so sick of words! I get words all day through;<br />
First from him, now from you!<br />

<p>My mother is tired. Physically, mentally, and most of the time.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think she is fed-up. I think she really is tired, just a combination of old age and the cocktail of medication that keeps her bodily functions in check.</p>
<p>Some days I wonder what will happen if we were to take all the medication away. Maybe her body will bounce back and reset itself. Maybe it won&#8217;t, so that&#8217;s a dangerous strategy.</p>
<p>Everyday presents a new challenge in trying to engage my mother with her physical exercises. I try all sorts of things to keep her interested. I have seen how bad things can get when we don&#8217;t actively employ our muscles. The warning &#8216;use it or lose it&#8217; is so accurate, as muscles atrophy (waste away) very fast when not used.</p>
<p>This afternoon I asked my mother to count out loudly as she did her side steps and lunges. This was very low-key. Yesterday we gently swung our arms and twisted our hips to Engelbert Humperdinck&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2etakoV-rg">Quando, Quando, Quando</a>. On another occasion we were slightly more vigorous with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHGXwQeUk7M">Chubby Checker&#8217;s The Twist</a>. Our friends at wikiHow <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Do-the-Twist">show you how to do it</a>.</p>
<p>But as I said, my mother was tired today. However I still wanted to challenge her, hence the counting out loud. I asked her to do this in English, Hakka, Mandarin, Cantonese and finally in Malay. Surprisingly she enjoyed this challenge very much.</p>
<p>In the afternoons, before her 3 o&#8217;clock nap, my mother and I play a made-up version of Bananagrams. I choose words based on what book she has read that morning, and she has to find the letters and make the words. Today, I thought she should make up words in Malay. It was fun. I am glad my mother likes words. She was so pleased with the results.</p>

<p>For dinner I went to <a href="https://www.madamkwans.com.my">Madam Kwan&#8217;s</a> and thought about having Nasi Lemak, but then decided to have Nasi Bojari instead, as it came with a large piece of fried chicken drumstick. I get so hungry at the end of the day after working with my mother. Madam Kwan&#8217;s has its origins in Sakura Restaurant in Jalan Imbi. I used to meet my mother there after school and we would have our favourite dishes together. Those days are long gone. It has come to this. Most days I don&#8217;t have a strategy when I walk into the house, and I don&#8217;t know how the story ends. All I know is that I need to do my best, because every patient sinks or swims not only on their own efforts, but also on the efforts of the team around them. For now, I am thankful that my mother is managing to paddle very well.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee_Gees">Bee Gees</a> so I end this post with their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkqwRC23HN8">Words</a>.</p>
