</figure><p><b>San Francisco, California</b></p><p>In the 2.5 months since NASA’s first asteroid sample-return mission <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02954-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02954-2" data-track-category="body text link">landed safely on Earth</a>, technicians have carefully plucked more than 70 grams of asteroid dust and pebbles from the spacecraft’s canister. That’s more than ten times the amount brought back from an asteroid previously, and more than NASA declared necessary to call the mission a success. Some of the pebbles even seem to contain a combination of chemical elements that is puzzling researchers.</p><article data-label="Related">

Biggest-ever haul of asteroid dust and rock returns to Earth</p></a>
 </article><p>But these early discoveries are still a long way from where planetary scientists had hoped to be after the 24 September touchdown. In October, researchers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, discovered that 2 of the 35 screws that fasten the lid of the sample-return canister couldn’t be removed — blocking access to the remainder of the space rocks. Curators used tweezers to pull out what they could, and NASA is now making new screwdrivers so it can get into the device it flew billions of kilometres across the Solar System to the asteroid Bennu and back.</p><p>Until then, “it’s kind of like Schrödinger’s sample”, said Dante Lauretta, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson who heads the scientific-analysis team for the OSIRIS-REx mission. “We don’t know what’s in there.” Lauretta spoke at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, California, on 11 December, where he presented the first results of the mission.</p><p>Still, there’s plenty of research to do with the 70.3 grams that technicians have managed to extract so far. Early analysis suggests that the Bennu fragments are rich in volatile chemical compounds preserved in the deep freeze of space since the Solar System’s birth more than 4.5 billion years ago. “This alone makes the whole mission worthwhile,” Lauretta said. “We now have abundant pristine material” from the dawn of the Solar System.</p><h2>Precious cargo</h2><p>When pieces of asteroid fall to Earth as meteorites, they pass through the planet’s atmosphere, which heats them up and potentially alters their chemical make-up. The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft kept its copious cargo protected from any such alterations.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>The haul includes a 3.5-centimetre-long rock, the biggest collected on Bennu. It is so large that it jammed the spacecraft’s collecting mechanism open when OSIRIS-REx <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02910-4" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02910-4" data-track-category="body text link">briefly touched the asteroid’s surface in 2020</a> to hoover up a collection of pebbles and dust. Like nearly all of the Bennu material, the rock is dark-coloured, almost to the point of being black — although it has a bluish sheen to it, Lauretta reported at the meeting. That’s similar to the highly reflective boulders that OSIRIS-REx photographed on Bennu’s surface as it orbited the asteroid.</p><p>Other, smaller chunks in the Bennu sample have light-coloured reflective coatings, making them seem brighter than the darker pebbles. But, under a scanning electron microscope, they were found to be covered in a highly brittle layer that broke easily, revealing a dark interior. Chemical analysis showed that this light-coloured surface skin contained magnesium, sodium and phosphate. This combination is rarely if ever seen in meteorites, Lauretta said. “It’s a head-scratcher right now.”</p><p>Other bits of Bennu contain hydrated clay minerals known as phyllosilicates, as well as carbonates, magnetite and sulfide minerals. All of these were anticipated but are good to see, Lauretta said. The Bennu sample <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03178-0" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03178-0" data-track-category="body text link">also contains organic compounds</a> — those containing carbon–carbon or carbon–hydrogen bonds — including a large amount of the ringed molecules known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Organic materials such as these have been found in meteorites on Earth and might have been involved in the rise of life on this planet.</p><h2>Freeing the samples</h2><p>So far, curators have catalogued more than 1,000 Bennu particles that are larger than 0.5 millimetres, Lauretta said. Previously, only the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s Hayabusa and Hayabusa2 missions, to asteroids Itogawa in 2005 and Ryugu in 2018, respectively, have returned samples. But those brought back no more than a teaspoonful of material between them.</p><p>In addition to the 70.3 grams of Bennu already catalogued, an estimated 30–70 grams of material still lie inside the heart of OSIRIS-REx’s sample-return canister, Lauretta said. The screwdrivers that NASA is building to free the remaining rocks and dust will need to be made from materials that won’t contaminate the samples, which are currently inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox. It could be weeks before technicians can unfasten the stuck screws.</p>
