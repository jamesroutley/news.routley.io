    <h1>GNU Artanis 1.0.0 Released</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-org29e9361">
<p>
GNU Artanis was born in 2013, and it&#39;s a web application framework written in Guile Scheme. It&#39;s designed to be simple and easy to use, and it&#39;s suitable for small to medium web applications. It&#39;s licensed under GPLv3+ and LGPLv3.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning, Artanis was largely inspired by Ruby on Rails to generate the scaffold code as possible. And the URL remapping API was inspired by Sinatra, another web framework of Ruby. That&#39;s why it&#39;s named &#34;Artanis&#34;, since it&#39;s the revserse of &#34;Sinatra&#34;.
</p>

<p>
But as time goes by, Artanis has its own features and design.
</p>

<p>
The first convention of Artanis is &#34;Scheme only&#34;, we don&#39;t intend to write C code for extension as possible, unless it&#39;s really necessary. So far, we still don&#39;t have any C code in Artanis. The contributors may provide extension in C, but the Artanis core is still pure Scheme. That&#39;s because GNU Guile provides great features to interact with C libraries, which is the original reason why Guile exists.
</p>

<p>
The default server core of Artanis is named &#34;Ragnarok&#34;, which is high performance asynchronous non-blocking server design based on co-routine. Notably, the co-routine is implemented in pure Scheme feature called Delimited Continuation.
</p>

<p>
GNU Artanis is both the official project of GNU operating system, and <a href="https://hardenedlinux.org">HardenedLinux community</a>.
