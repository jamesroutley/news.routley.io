<p>Like most people, you’re probably an absolute expert at landing on the aircraft carrier in <em>Top Gun</em> for the NES. But if you’re in the silent minority that have not yet mastered this skill, you’re in luck: I’ve done a little reverse engineerining and figured out <em>precisely</em> how landing works. Hopefully now you can get things really dialed in during your next practice session. Let’s get those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxqKp_s6GWU">windmill high-fives</a> warmed up!</p>
<p>tl;dr: Altitude must be in the range 100-299, speed must be in the range 238-337 (both inclusive), and you must be laterally aimed at the carrier at the end of the sequence.</p>
<p>As a reminder in case you haven’t played Top Gun in the last few decades (weird), the landing portion of the stage looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://relaxing.run/blag/posts/top-gun-landing/landing.gif" alt="Perfect landing"/></p>
<p>Mercifully, the game suggests you aim right in the middle of the acceptable range per the “Alt. 200 / Speed 288” text on your MFD. Altitude and speed are both controlled by throttle input and pitch angle. There’s no on-screen heading indicator, but the game will tell you if you’re outside of the acceptable range (“Right ! Right !”). The ranges for speed and heading are pretty tight, so focus on those: the range for altitude is much wider.</p>
<p>After about a minute of flying the game checks your state and plays a little cutscene showing either a textbook landing or an expensive fireball. Either way, you get a “Mission Accomplished!” and go to the next level (after all, you don’t own that plane, the taxpayers do):</p>

<p>Speed and altitude are stored as binary coded decimals, likely to simplify the rendering of on-screen text. For example, the number 1234 is stored as 4660 (ie., hex 0x1234).</p>
<p>The function at $B6EA performs the state check and writes the result at $9E. If you’re just here to impress your friends and don’t want to put in the practice, the game genie code AEPETA will guarantee a landing that Maverick and Goose (spoiler: <span>may he rest in peace</span>
) would be proud of.</p>
