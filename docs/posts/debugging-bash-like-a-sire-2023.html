    <h1>Debugging Bash Like a Sire (2023)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div><p>Many engineers have a strained relationship with Bash. I love it though, but I’m
very aware of it’s limitations when it comes to error handling and
data structures (or lack thereof).</p><p>As a result of these limitations I often see Bash scripts written very defensively
that define something like:</p><p>These are bash builtin options that do more or less sensible things.</p><ul><li>e: Exit immediately when a non-zero exit status is encountered</li><li>u: Undefined variables throws an error and exits the script</li><li>x: Print every evaluation.</li><li>o pipefail: Here we make sure that any error in a pipe of commands will fail
the entire pipe instead just carrying on to the next command in the pipe.</li></ul><p>All of these are quite useful, thought I tend to skip the <code>-u</code> flag as bash
scripts often interact with global variables that are set outside my scripts.
The <code>-x</code> flag is extremely noisy so it’s most often used manually when
debugging. And to be honest, I don’t really use <code>-o pipefail</code> either.
I guess this is a good place for a few words of caution when it comes to this
approach. Feel free to dig into <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/g1vsxk/comment/fniifmk/">this reddit
comment</a>,
but to summarize, the behavior of these flags aren’t consistent across Bash
versions and they can break your scripts in unexpected ways.</p><p>For the current context though the shortcoming with these flags is that they don’t necessarily tell
you <em>where</em> the problem is, and sometimes not even <em>what</em> the problem is.
Because of this I very often recreate the following functions when I interact
with larger code bases:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>function</span> log::info <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  log::_write_log <span>&#34;INFO&#34;</span> <span>&#34;</span>$@<span>&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>function</span> log::level_is_active <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>  local check_level current_level
</span></span><span><span>  check_level<span>=</span>$1
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  declare -A log_levels<span>=(</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>[</span>DEBUG<span>]=</span><span>1</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>[</span>INFO<span>]=</span><span>2</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>[</span>WARN<span>]=</span><span>3</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>[</span>ERROR<span>]=</span><span>4</span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  check_level<span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>${</span>log_levels[<span>&#34;</span>$check_level<span>&#34;</span>]<span>}</span><span>&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span>  current_level<span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>${</span>log_levels[<span>&#34;</span>$LOG_LEVEL<span>&#34;</span>]<span>}</span><span>&#34;</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>  <span>((</span> check_level &gt;<span>=</span> current_level <span>))</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
