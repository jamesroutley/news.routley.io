<p>T-Mobile on Monday said it experienced a hack that exposed account PINs and other customer data in the company&#39;s second network intrusion this year and the ninth since 2018.</p>
<p>The intrusion, which started on February 24 and lasted until March 30, affected 836 customers, according to a <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/ea3bf342-eca7-4833-b128-7b09f6893ac4.shtml">notification</a> on the website of Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey.</p>
<p>“The information obtained for each customer varied but may have included full name, contact information, account number and associated phone numbers, T-Mobile account PIN, social security number, government ID, date of birth, balance due, internal codes that T-Mobile uses to service customer accounts (for example, rate plan and feature codes), and the number of lines,” the company wrote in a <a href="https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/ea3bf342-eca7-4833-b128-7b09f6893ac4/00363120-37a5-4248-aa8c-0be84d146071/document.html">letter</a> sent to affected customers. Account PINs, which customers use to swap out SIM cards and authorize other important changes to their accounts, were reset once T-Mobile discovered the breach on March 27.</p>
<p>The incident is the second hack to hit T-Mobile this year. It’s the ninth since 2018, based on <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/19/t-mobile-data-breach/">reporting</a> by TechCrunch. In January, T-Mobile said “bad actors” abused its application programming in a way that allowed them to access the data of 37 million customers. The hack started on November 25, 2022, and wasn’t discovered by T-Mobile until January 5, TechCrunch said. Data obtained in that incident included names, billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, T-Mobile account numbers, and information such as the number of lines on accounts and plan features.</p>
<p>From 2018 through 2022, T-Mobile disclosed seven more hacks. In the most recent of those, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/lapsus-hackers-t-mobile/">reported</a> in April 2022, a hacker gang that goes by the name of Lapsus$ gained access to the company’s internal tools and, from there, carried out so-called SIM swaps, a type of hack that allows unauthorized people to port someone’s phone number to the phone of the threat actor.</p>
<p>Other data breaches include <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/hackers-who-breached-t-mobile-stole-personal-data-for-49-million-accounts/">one in 2021</a> that exposed data belonging to 49 million customers.</p>
