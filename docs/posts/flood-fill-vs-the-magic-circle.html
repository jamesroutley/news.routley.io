<p>If you’ve ever used Pho­to­shop or another image editing program, you know the paint bucket tool. Here is its pri­mor­dial form:</p>

<p>The oper­a­tion exe­cuted by this tool is “flood fill”: color stretches out from the cursor, trans­forming every­thing until it reaches an unbroken line of pixels. The first few times I used it, back in the early 1990s, it was thrilling.</p>
<p>Think not of an image, but an <span>economy — </span><wbr/>a world. And think not of a color, but a process: AI automa­tion. The paint bucket just tipped over onto com­puting <span>programming — </span><wbr/><span>click — </span><wbr/></p>

<figcaption>There it goes</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>—and the very live ques­tion is: how far will this flood fill extend?</p>
<p>Into all dig­ital work? Possibly? Probably? And what about other kinds of work, those not yoked to screens and inboxes? <a href="https://www.mechanize.work/?utm_source=Robin_Sloan_sent_me">One argu­ment goes:</a> the flood is coming for EVERYTHING, as super­s­mart com­puters yield super­good robots yield uni­versal automa­tion.</p>
<p>But this isn’t cor­rect. There is an unbroken line of pixels out there; a firewall; a magic circle.</p>
<hr/>
<p>“Magic circle” is a term drawn from the study of games. It comes from Johan Huizinga; I learned it from Frank Lantz. The idea (in my formulation) is that games unfold in a spe­cial space, phys­ical and/or intellectual, marked off ahead of time, in which action is constrained.</p>
<p>Playing chess, your goal is to knock over your oppo­nent’s king, yet you don’t just reach across and swat it aside. You <em>can</em> do this; nothing restrains your hand. But the point of the game is to play the game. You and your oppo­nent both agreed to that ahead of time.</p>
<p>Human civ­i­liza­tion is a super­com­pli­cated set of over­lap­ping magic cir­cles, some tiny and delightful, others huge and consequential. At one end, the chess­board and the tennis court; at another, the economy and the law.</p>
<p>The huge games are more complex, because (the polit­ical the­o­rists tell us) their magic cir­cles are backed, ultimately, by violence. If you swipe not chess pieces but pri­vate property, offi­cers of the state will lock you up in a little room. But even in those cases, it’s a magic circle that defines the set of accept­able actions; the phys­ical con­se­quences are just a backstop. This is dif­ferent from a domain like, e.g., agriculture, in which there’s no magic circle at all, just the ground-floor reality of sun and rain, dirt and weeds.</p>
<hr/>
<p>So. What is the magic circle of AI?</p>
<p>It’s the same as the magic circle of computation, which is: sym­bols in, sym­bols out. Easy as that. Alan Turing drew its outline, way back in <span>1936 — </span><wbr/>incredible.</p>
<p>It’s worth noticing that not all tech­nolo­gies impose magic cir­cles. I have a blender, and I can put a lot of dif­ferent things in it; indeed, I can <em>try</em> to blend any­thing. Even another tech­nology con­cerned mostly with sym­bols, the notebook, will accept all sorts of inputs. I can tuck a dry leaf between pages. The paper can absorb a bit of per­fume from the hand moving across it.</p>
<p>Com­pu­ta­tion is there­fore paradoxical: supremely flexible, yet narrow and stingy. Inside its magic circle, any­thing can become any­thing else … but how do you get inside? Why can’t I tuck a dry leaf between browser tabs? The ques­tion is nonsensical, and for that I blame the tab, not the leaf.</p>
<p>I want to dwell on this point; I want you to really get it. It’s easy to over­es­ti­mate the scope of computation, because it has become so promi­nent in day-to-day life. Yet the view through a drinking straw would seem substantial, too, if you spent all your time looking through it.</p>
<p>I believe that analogy com­mu­ni­cates the cor­rect magnitudes. Com­pared to the rich­ness and com­plexity of the phys­ical, the dig­ital, in all its sophistication, is approx­i­mately the drinking straw.</p>
<p>Helpfully, this pinches both ways.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Con­sider the printer!</p>
<p>There’s a reason they are the eternal bane of com­puter users. It’s because, in most sys­tems, they are the bridge between the dig­ital and the phys­ical: the place where a stream of sym­bols col­lides with dust, moisture, friction, obstruc­tion … welcome to the real world!</p>
<p>Engi­neers have been toiling for many decades to per­fect the printer, and still, it jams. After all this time, the printer remains, noto­ri­ously and hilariously, the weak link.</p>
<p>But it’s not the printer’s fault that it sits across a step-change in com­plexity; visu­alize wild vortices, brutal turbulence. The dig­ital, no matter how hard it <span>tries — </span><wbr/>and it does <span>try — </span><wbr/>cannot match <a href="https://www.rudyrucker.com/blog/2013/09/06/gnarly-sf-reality-1-what-is-gnarl/?utm_source=Robin_Sloan_sent_me">the gnarl</a> of the phys­ical.</p>
<p>A pleasing image: if indeed AI automa­tion does not flood fill the phys­ical world, it will be because the humble paper jam stood in its way.</p>
<p>There’s our first glimpse of an unbroken line of pixels.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Here’s the story of the coolest thing I pro­grammed last year.</p>
<p>I wanted a way to track let­ters sent via First Class mail. USPS doesn’t pro­vide this directly, a la parcel tracking, but it does scan those <span>let­ters — </span><wbr/>all of <span>them — </span><wbr/>and the data is avail­able, but you have to wire every­thing up yourself, jumping through a few hoops along the way.</p>
<p>This devel­op­ment process took about a month, and it involved:</p>
<ol>
<li>writing code</li>
<li>designing and printing custom labels with exotic barcodes</li>
<li>mailing real physical letters</li>
<li>watching USPS scan data stream into a test database</li>
<li>receiving those same letters, then adjusting #1-4 in response</li>
</ol>
<p>This was a fun project with real value: it unlocked a ful­fill­ment model for my online shop. Now, I can mail orders around the world with a single (cheap!) stamp, yet also offer cus­tomers <a href="https://usps.robinsloan.dev/FE4A61B172710D75?utm_source=Robin_Sloan_sent_me">a nice tracking page</a>.</p>
<p>The project cut across sev­eral dif­ferent magic <span>cir­cles — </span><wbr/>Ruby code, quasi-governmental APIs, the rules and stan­dards of the postal <span>system — </span><wbr/>but/and it also broke out into the phys­ical world of paper, printers, and post offices. The project required manip­u­la­tions including but not lim­ited to: folding, peeling, sticking … gnarly!!</p>
<p>It’s pos­sible that an AI coding agent could have helped me with #1 above, and of course it could have advised me on the rest. But it’s impos­sible to imagine the AI agent han­dling #2-5 autonomously; it would require such a Rube Gold­berg tangle of sup­port that “autonomously” would no longer apply.</p>
<hr/>
<p>On this point, enthu­si­asts insist that AI agents will be able to orches­trate any kind of project in the phys­ical world by (1) oper­ating robots, and/or (2) enlisting human hands.</p>
<p>Robots are improving fast, but I do not believe that <a href="https://www.sunday.ai/?utm_source=Robin_Sloan_sent_me">this cute fellow</a> will be stuffing envelopes or affixing stamps any­time soon.</p>
<p>Animal sup­port is more plausible, and I don’t doubt that vast, strange mar­kets for human hands will soon emerge.</p>
<p>My argu­ment is NOT that AI agents will be barred from the phys­ical world. It’s only that they will trade pro­found super­powers in dig­ital space for crushing hand­i­caps on our turf. Action will become clumsy and costly, with slow feed­back loops, easily stymied.</p>
<p>The paper will jam, over and over again.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a name="redesign"></a>Did you know there are many kinds of stitch that a sewing machine simply cannot produce? Conversely, the machine’s trade­mark lock stitch, in which two sep­a­rate threads are looped together above and below the fabric, was never sewn by humans. It was devel­oped specif­i­cally to suit the machine’s capa­bil­i­ties and limitations.</p>
<p>Sewing wasn’t so much auto­mated as redesigned.</p>
<p>Likewise, con­sider this guy:</p>

<img width="1200" height="900" src="https://www.robinsloan.com/img/code-oxbo.jpg" decoding="async" loading="eager" alt="Oxbo 6430 olive harvester"/>

</figure>
<p>That’s an over-the-row olive harvester. Most olive oil pro­duc­tion at medium-or-greater scale depends on machines of this kind; they trundle over trees planted in long rows, almost like con­tin­uous hedges, and col­lect the fruit with vibrating fingers. Machine-har­vested olives cost less to buy, and they arrive at the mill in better shape than olives har­vested by hand.</p>
<p>The catch: most olives can’t be cul­ti­vated in this configuration; the trees don’t thrive so close together. Only a handful of vari­eties will tol­erate it, so those handful have been planted in huge numbers, and the flavor of global olive oil has changed as a result.</p>
<p>Like sewing, olive har­vesting wasn’t so much auto­mated as redesigned, though that word doesn’t really com­mu­ni­cate the inten­sity of the process: old groves ripped out, new groves planted.</p>
<p>Automa­tion never meets a task in the world and simply does it. There’s always <span>negotiation — </span><wbr/>the inven­tion of some new zip­pered relationship. Trains don’t run without long, con­tin­uous tracks; cars don’t drive without smooth, hard roads.</p>
<p>All of this takes time.</p>
<hr/>
<p>To this day, no machine in the world can loop a thread through itself. Isn’t that wild? If you ever come across a book sewn with a beautiful, prac­tical <a href="https://blog.papercraftpanda.com/overview-how-to-create-a-book-using-the-coptic-binding-method/?utm_source=Robin_Sloan_sent_me">Coptic binding</a>, you might imagine it shouting: “I was made by human hands!”</p>
<p>Recently, I untan­gled my sewing machine, and I am here to tell you that no robot will untangle a sewing machine before the year 2226, and pos­sibly not before the heat death of the universe.</p>
<hr/>
<p>In summary: the flood fill stops at the printer, with dust, moisture, friction, and obstruc­tion guarding the <span>gate — </span><wbr/>as ter­rible a Four Horsemen as you could hope to recruit.</p>
<p>The magic circle of the dig­ital is a bril­liant cage.</p>
<p>Does my framing have any prac­tical impli­ca­tions? Is this news you can use? Sure!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Think about your work and your interests. If they are fully inside the magic circle of “sym­bols, in, sym­bols out”, then your world is changing, and will soon change faster, and it’s prob­ably time to get cre­ative about what you might do dif­ferently, and how you might “season” your work with the phys­ical. (Subscribers to <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/?utm_source=Robin_Sloan_sent_me">my main newsletter</a> will rec­og­nize that this is what I’ve been doing for the past couple of years. My zine titled <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/shop/secret-playbook/">The Secret Playbook</a>, avail­able only in print, was a guide to nudging your art out­side the magic circle.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One impli­ca­tion of a flood-filled internet is that it will soon be crowded with relent­less auto­matic adversaries. Therefore, I think it’s going to make sense to keep more sys­tems and devices offline. I believe a thick and sultry airgap has always been a good idea; it might soon become a necessity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Broadly, I believe the con­struc­tion of richer bridges between the dig­ital and phys­ical is a ter­rible idea. Why collaborate?? If/when those mar­kets for human hands emerge, I believe it will make sense to reg­u­late them tightly. More pointedly: it will be totally irre­spon­sible to allow autonomous com­puter pro­grams to hire humans to com­plete tasks in the phys­ical world without review by another human.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>Here’s a simple observation:</p>
<p>The world can run without an internet.</p>
<p>The internet can’t run without a world.</p>
<p>It’s magic cir­cles all the way down, except for ground-floor reality. In the haze of end­less options, I find it bracing to rec­og­nize that this one thing is mandatory. You go to sleep in it; you wake up into it. You share it with the rhinoceros, the anchovy, the Joshua tree.</p>
<p>Soft­ware cannot, in fact, eat this world. Soft­ware can reflect it; encroach upon it; more than any­thing, dis­tract us from it. But the real phys­ical world is indigestible.</p>
<p>So here is our unbroken line of pixels.</p>
<p>I don’t know that this is much of a balm. The flood fill of AI automa­tion might indeed con­sume every­thing within the magic circle of the dig­ital, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOYtr1rvfHM">all my stuff is there</a>. Now I’m get­ting speculative, a bit romantic … but I wonder how his­tory will regard the forty years that humanity spent in the fairy realm of the internet?</p>
<p>I wonder if every­body will say: wow … that was weird!</p>
<p>It might sur­prise you to hear that econ­o­mists still debate the actual effect of infor­ma­tion tech­nology on productivity. Like … all infor­ma­tion tech­nology, from the 1970s through today! There’s no ques­tion com­puters and net­works have allowed, e.g., busi­ness infor­ma­tion to travel faster; at the same time, they have produced, e.g., crushing new admin­is­tra­tive burdens. It prob­ably nets out positive … but it’s not the slam dunk you might imagine.</p>
<p>Per­haps there’s one sce­nario for the flood fill in which all the prob­lems com­puters have created, com­puters will solve, and the magic circle will darken, and it will feel like closing the door on a vast labyrinth, walking back out into the sunlight.</p>
<p>Back to what­ever we were doing before.</p>
