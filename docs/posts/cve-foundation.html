While this structure has supported the program’s growth, it has also raised longstanding concerns among members of the CVE Board about the sustainability and neutrality of a globally relied-upon resource being tied to a single government sponsor.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>This concern has become urgent following an April 15, 2025 letter from MITRE notifying the CVE Board that the U.S. government does not intend to renew its contract for managing the program. While we had hoped this day would not come, we have been preparing for this possibility.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In response, a coalition of longtime, active CVE Board members have spent the past year developing a strategy to transition CVE to a dedicated, non-profit foundation. The new CVE Foundation will focus solely on continuing the mission of delivering high-quality vulnerability identification and maintaining the integrity and availability of CVE data for defenders worldwide.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>“CVE, as a cornerstone of the global cybersecurity ecosystem, is too important to be vulnerable itself,” said Kent Landfield, an officer of the Foundation. “Cybersecurity professionals around the globe rely on CVE identifiers and data as part of their daily work—from security tools and advisories to threat intelligence and response. Without CVE, defenders are at a massive disadvantage against global cyber threats.”</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The formation of the CVE Foundation marks a major step toward eliminating a single point of failure in the vulnerability management ecosystem and ensuring the CVE Program remains a globally trusted, community-driven initiative. For the international cybersecurity community, this move represents an opportunity to establish governance that reflects the global nature of today’s threat landscape.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Over the coming days, the Foundation will release more information about its structure, transition planning, and opportunities for involvement from the broader community.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>For updates or inquiries, contact: </span><a href="mailto:info@thecvefoundation.org" target="_blank"><span>info@thecvefoundation.org</span></a><span>.</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>
