<p>18th November 2025</p>



<p>Google released Gemini 3 Pro today. Here’s <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3/">the announcement from Sundar Pichai, Demis Hassabis, and Koray Kavukcuoglu</a>, their <a href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-3-developers/">developer blog announcement from Logan Kilpatrick</a>, the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Model-Cards/Gemini-3-Pro-Model-Card.pdf">Gemini 3 Pro Model Card</a>, and their <a href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-collection/">collection of 11 more articles</a>. It’s a big release!</p>
<p>I had a few days of preview access to this model via <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/">AI Studio</a>. The best way to describe it is that it’s <strong>Gemini 2.5 upgraded to match the leading rival models</strong>.</p>
<p>Gemini 3 has the same underlying characteristics as Gemini 2.5. The knowledge cutoff is the same (January 2025). It accepts 1 million input tokens, can output up to 64,000 tokens, and has multimodal inputs across text, images, audio, and video.</p>
<h4 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h4>
<p>Google’s own reported numbers (in <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/Model-Cards/Gemini-3-Pro-Model-Card.pdf">the model card</a>) show it scoring slightly higher against Claude 4.5 Sonnet and GPT-5.1 against most of the standard benchmarks. As always I’m waiting for independent confirmation, but I have no reason to believe those numbers are inaccurate.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-benchmarks.jpg" alt="Table of benchmark numbers, described in full below"/></p>
<h4 id="pricing">Pricing</h4>
<p>It terms of pricing it’s a little more expensive than Gemini 2.5 but still cheaper than Claude Sonnet 4.5. Here’s how it fits in with those other leading models:</p>

<p>That screenshot of the benchmarks from above looked like a good test for Gemini 3’s multimodal support. I fed it that image URL and asked it to generate alt text for the image:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>llm -m gemini-3-pro-preview -a https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-benchmarks.jpg &#39;Alt text for this image, include all figures and make them comprehensible to a screen reader user&#39;</code></p>

<p>To try it out against an audio file I extracted the 3h33m of audio from the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgJ7x7R6gy0">Half Moon Bay City Council Meeting—November 4, 2025</a>. I used <code>yt-dlp</code> to get that audio:</p>
<div><pre>yt-dlp -x --audio-format m4a <span><span>&#39;</span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgJ7x7R6gy0<span>&#39;</span></span></pre></div>
<p>That gave me a 74M m4a file, which I ran through Gemini 3 Pro like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>llm -m gemini-3-pro-preview -a /tmp/HMBCC\ 11⧸4⧸25\ -\ Half\ Moon\ Bay\ City\ Council\ Meeting\ -\ November\ 4,\ 2025\ \[qgJ7x7R6gy0\].m4a &#39;Output a Markdown transcript of this meeting. Include speaker names and timestamps. Start with an outline of the key meeting sections, each with a title and summary and timestamp and list of participating names. Note in bold if anyone raised their voices, interrupted each other or had disagreements. Then follow with the full transcript.&#39;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That failed with an “Internal error encountered” message, so I shrunk the file down to a more manageable 38MB using <code>ffmpeg</code>:</p>
<div><pre>ffmpeg -i <span><span>&#34;</span>/private/tmp/HMB.m4a<span>&#34;</span></span> -ac 1 -ar 22050 -c:a aac -b:a 24k <span><span>&#34;</span>/private/tmp/HMB_compressed.m4a<span>&#34;</span></span></pre></div>
<p>Then ran it again like this (for some reason I had to use <code>--attachment-type</code> this time):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>llm -m gemini-3-pro-preview --attachment-type /tmp/HMB_compressed.m4a &#39;audio/aac&#39; &#39;Output a Markdown transcript of this meeting. Include speaker names and timestamps. Start with an outline of the key meeting sections, each with a title and summary and timestamp and list of participating names. Note in bold if anyone raised their voices, interrupted each other or had disagreements. Then follow with the full transcript.&#39;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This time it worked! The <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0b7bc23adb6698f376aebfd700943314">full output is here</a>, but it starts like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is the transcript of the Half Moon Bay City Council meeting.</p>
<h4>Meeting Outline</h4>
<p><strong>1. Call to Order, Updates, and Public Forum</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Mayor Brownstone calls the meeting to order. City Manager Chidester reports no reportable actions from the closed session. Announcements are made regarding food insecurity volunteers and the Diwali celebration. During the public forum, Councilmember Penrose (speaking as a citizen) warns against autocracy. Citizens speak regarding lease agreements, downtown maintenance, local music events, and homelessness outreach statistics.</li>
<li>
<strong>Timestamp:</strong> 00:00:00—00:13:25</li>
<li>
<strong>Participants:</strong> Mayor Brownstone, Matthew Chidester, Irma Acosta, Deborah Penrose, Jennifer Moore, Sandy Vella, Joaquin Jimenez, Anita Rees.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Consent Calendar</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Summary:</strong> The Council approves minutes from previous meetings and a resolution authorizing a licensing agreement for Seahorse Ranch. Councilmember Johnson corrects a pull request regarding abstentions on minutes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Timestamp:</strong> 00:13:25—00:15:15</li>
<li>
<strong>Participants:</strong> Mayor Brownstone, Councilmember Johnson, Councilmember Penrose, Vice Mayor Ruddick, Councilmember Nagengast.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Ordinance Introduction: Commercial Vitality (Item 9A)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Staff presents a new ordinance to address neglected and empty commercial storefronts, establishing maintenance and display standards. Councilmembers discuss enforcement mechanisms, window cleanliness standards, and the need for objective guidance documents to avoid subjective enforcement.</li>
<li>
<strong>Timestamp:</strong> 00:15:15—00:30:45</li>
<li>
<strong>Participants:</strong> Karen Decker, Councilmember Johnson, Councilmember Nagengast, Vice Mayor Ruddick, Councilmember Penrose.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Ordinance Introduction: Building Standards &amp; Electrification (Item 9B)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Staff introduces updates to the 2025 Building Code. A major change involves repealing the city’s all-electric building requirement due to the 9th Circuit Court ruling (<em>California Restaurant Association v. City of Berkeley</em>). <strong>Public speaker Mike Ferreira expresses strong frustration and disagreement with “unelected state agencies” forcing the City to change its ordinances.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Timestamp:</strong> 00:30:45—00:45:00</li>
<li>
<strong>Participants:</strong> Ben Corrales, Keith Weiner, Joaquin Jimenez, Jeremy Levine, Mike Ferreira, Councilmember Penrose, Vice Mayor Ruddick.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Housing Element Update &amp; Adoption (Item 9C)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Staff presents the 5th draft of the Housing Element, noting State HCD requirements to modify ADU allocations and place a measure on the ballot regarding the “Measure D” growth cap. <strong>There is significant disagreement from Councilmembers Ruddick and Penrose regarding the State’s requirement to hold a ballot measure.</strong> Public speakers debate the enforceability of Measure D. <strong>Mike Ferreira interrupts the vibe to voice strong distaste for HCD’s interference in local law.</strong> The Council votes to adopt the element but strikes the language committing to a ballot measure.</li>
<li>
<strong>Timestamp:</strong> 00:45:00—01:05:00</li>
<li>
<strong>Participants:</strong> Leslie (Staff), Joaquin Jimenez, Jeremy Levine, Mike Ferreira, Councilmember Penrose, Vice Mayor Ruddick, Councilmember Johnson.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Transcript</h4>
<p><strong>Mayor Brownstone</strong> [00:00:00]
Good evening everybody and welcome to the November 4th Half Moon Bay City Council meeting. As a reminder, we have Spanish interpretation services available in person and on Zoom.</p>
<p><strong>Victor Hernandez (Interpreter)</strong> [00:00:35]
Thank you, Mr. Mayor, City Council, all city staff, members of the public. <em>[Spanish instructions provided regarding accessing the interpretation channel on Zoom and in the room.]</em> Thank you very much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those first two lines of the transcript already illustrate something interesting here: Gemini 3 Pro chose NOT to include the exact text of the Spanish instructions, instead summarizing them as “[Spanish instructions provided regarding accessing the interpretation channel on Zoom and in the room.]”.</p>
<p>I haven’t spot-checked the entire 3hr33m meeting, but I’ve confirmed that the timestamps do not line up. The transcript closes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mayor Brownstone</strong> [01:04:00]
Meeting adjourned. Have a good evening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That actually happens <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgJ7x7R6gy0&amp;t=3h31m5s">at 3h31m5s</a> and the mayor says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay. Well, thanks everybody, members of the public for participating. Thank you for staff. Thank you to fellow council members. This meeting is now adjourned. Have a good evening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m disappointed about the timestamps, since mismatches there make it much harder to jump to the right point and confirm that the summarized transcript is an accurate representation of what was said.</p>
<p>This took 320,087 input tokens and 7,870 output tokens, for a total cost of <a href="https://www.llm-prices.com/#it=320087&amp;ot=7870&amp;ic=4&amp;oc=18">$1.42</a>.</p>
<h4 id="and-a-new-pelican-benchmark">And a new pelican benchmark</h4>
<p>Gemini 3 Pro has a new concept of a “thinking level” which can be set to low or high (and defaults to high). I tried my classic <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/pelican-riding-a-bicycle/">Generate an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle</a> prompt at both levels.</p>
<p>Here’s low—Gemini decided to add a jaunty little hat (with a comment <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/70d56ba39b7cbb44985d2384004fc4a0#response">in the SVG</a> that says <code>&lt;!-- Hat (Optional Fun Detail) --&gt;</code>):</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-pelican-low.png" alt="The pelican is wearing a blue hat. It has a good beak. The bicycle is a little bit incorrect but generally a good effort."/></p>
<p>And here’s high. This is genuinely an excellent pelican, and the bicycle frame is at least the correct shape:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-pelican-high.png" alt="The pelican is not wearing a hat. It has a good beak. The bicycle is accurate and well-drawn."/></p>
<p>Honestly though, my pelican benchmark is beginning to feel a little bit too basic. I decided to upgrade it. Here’s v2 of the benchmark, which I plan to use going forward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Generate an SVG of a California brown pelican riding a bicycle. The bicycle must have spokes and a correctly shaped bicycle frame. The pelican must have its characteristic large pouch, and there should be a clear indication of feathers. The pelican must be clearly pedaling the bicycle. The image should show the full breeding plumage of the California brown pelican.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For reference, here’s a photo I took of a California brown pelican recently (sadly without a bicycle):</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/breeding-plumage.jpg" alt="A glorious California brown pelican perched on a rock by the water. It has a yellow tint to its head and a red spot near its throat."/></p>
<p>Here’s Gemini 3 Pro’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/2b9930ae1ce6f3f5e9cfe3cb31ec0c0a">attempt</a> at high thinking level for that new prompt:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gemini-3-breeding-pelican-high.png" alt="It&#39;s clearly a pelican. It has all of the requested features. It looks a bit abstract though."/></p>
<p>And for good measure, here’s that same prompt <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/7a655ebe42f3d428d2ea5363dad8067c">against GPT-5.1</a>—which produced this dumpy little fellow:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/gpt-5-1-breeding-pelican.png" alt="The pelican is very round. Its body overlaps much of the bicycle. It has a lot of dorky charisma."/></p>
<p>And Claude Sonnet 4.5, which <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/3296af92e4328dd4740385e6a4a2ac35">didn’t do quite as well</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2025/claude-sonnet-4-5-breeding-pelican.png" alt="Oh dear. It has all of the requested components, but the bicycle is a bit wrong and the pelican is arranged in a very awkward shape."/></p>
