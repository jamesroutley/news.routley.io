    <h1>New projects contribute to digital commons</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincolumn">
          
          <p>NLnet Foundation announces 62 new projects for the NGI Zero Commons Fund - the largest round of the programme yet. We congratulate the selected projects and look forward to the new capabilities these will bring to society. There were many more applications, we would like to take this opportunity to thank <em>all</em> applicants for their contributions towards digital commons and an open, trustworthy and more resilient internet.</p>
          
          <h3>From browser-based cellular networking to quantum-safe cryptography</h3>
          <p>The internet is the most complex technical and social infrastructure the world has seen yet. Preserving the public nature of the internet is not a given. Free and open source technologies, open standards, open hardware and open data help to strenghten the open web and the open internet. The projects selected by NLnet all contribute in their own way to this important goal, and will empower end users and the community at large on different layers of the stack. For example, there are people working a browser controlled ad hoc cellular network (<a href="http://jimkang.com/project/WSDR">Wsdr</a>) which can be used to create small mobile networks where they are needed. The open hardware security key <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Nitrokey3-FIDO-L2">Nitrokey</a> is aiming for formal certification of their implementation of the FIDO2 standard, and will be adding <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Nitrokey-Storage">encrypted storage capabilities</a>. There are also more applied technologies: the high end open hardware microscope <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/OpenFlexure">OpenFlexure</a> will enable among others e-health use cases such as telepathology, allowing medical professionals to work together to help people in more remote areas.</p>
          <p>While on the topic of microscopic structures: there are again a number of projects which will be working on libre silicon and trustworthy hardware. This ranges from <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/LibreSilicon-PadCellGen">pad cell generators</a>, <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/CARGO">automatic generation of analog and mixed Integrated Circuits</a> and <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Naja-LEC-TimingModelEngine">timing aware netlist optimisation with Logic Equivalence Checking</a> to entire <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Coriolis"> toolchains for VLSI design</a> — and even concrete <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Libre-Chip-proof">libre chip designs with proof of No Spectre bugs</a>. There will also be efforts on <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/OpenEPT">high-end open hardware to analyse energy consumption</a> (<a href="http://jimkang.com/project/OpenEPT">OpenEPT</a>, <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/BB3-CM5">BB3-CM5</a>), creative tools for <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Circuitpainter">programmable PCB creation</a> and collaborative <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Lens-FreeCAD-integration">computer assisted design</a> (CAD).</p>
          <h3>Decentralised social media and professional print</h3>
          <p>Thanks to the W3C ActivityPub standard, an increasing amount of applications allow users to benefit from social interaction without having to register accounts everywhere, or having to worry about privacy invasive practices from proprietary social networks. The standard is used in <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/NodeBB-collections">forum tools</a>, <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Funkwhale-AP">music sharing</a>, <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Icosa-Gallery">creating and sharing 3D models</a>, organising <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Fediverse-event-interop">events</a> and <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/WP-ActivityPub-polls">Polls</a> in the Fediverse. The project <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Mastodon-for-institutions">Mastodon for institutions</a> is adding features for large, institutional instances of Mastodon. Traditional media are not forgotten and can benefit from the work on modern type-setting tools that can create high quality print media (<a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Typst-Accessibility">Typst</a>, <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Vivliostyle">Vivliostyle</a>).</p>
          <h3>And much more</h3>
          <p>This was just a small sample of the wide range of important contributions that will be worked on — there is much more, across the entire technology stack and beyond, from a <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/SDCC-C23">low-level 8 bit compiler</a> via <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/DjNRO">wifi mapping</a> and <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/P2P-channels">P2P mesh networks</a> to <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/OWI-2">cross-language symbolic execution via WASM</a> and tools to collaboratively track <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/Modular-OTA">track terms and conditions of online services</a> and <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/OpenPrices">consumer product prices</a>. Read on to meet all 62 projects selected in this funding round, or check out the complete <a href="http://jimkang.com/project/current.html">overview of projects</a> currently funded by NLnet.</p>
          <p><b>If you applied for a grant</b></p><details>
              <summary>How do I find out which call round I applied to?</summary>You can see which call round you applied to by checking the application number assigned to the project when you submitted the proposal. The number starts with the year and month of the call, so 2024-12- in the case of the December 2024 call. You see that same number featured in the emails we send you (It should not happen, but if you did apply to another call and did not hear anything, do contact us)</details>
