      <p>According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), it’s estimated that <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/obesity-and-overweight">around two billion adults</a> worldwide are currently overweight. In other words, 25% of the world’s population is overweight.</p>
<p>A group of 80 participants, 41 men, and 39 women, with a body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) between 25 and 30, and sleeping cycles under 6.5h/day were invited to partake in a 2-week sleep experiment. Participants were randomized to either a 2-week sleep extension or a 2-week continued habitual sleep. Participants continued their daily routine activities at home without any prescribed diet or physical activity.</p>
<p><a href="https://oa.mg/work/10.1001/jamainternmed.2021.8098">Researchers</a> from the University of Chicago and the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that study participants consumed on average 270 calories less per day over two weeks if they slept at least one hour more than normal. Each 1-hour increase in sleep duration was associated with a decrease in energy intake of approximately 162 kcal/day. Furthermore, the findings on energy intake, energy expenditure, and weight were similar after adjustment for the effects of sex or menstrual cycle.</p>
<p><span>Participants who extended their sleep lost an average of 0.87kg (almost 2 pounds) in two weeks. Those who did not add an hour to their sleep gained 0.48kh (1 pound) over the same two weeks, regardless of other daily activities.</span> In other words, if the sleep extension was maintained for a period of 3 years, it would result in approximately 12kg of weight loss. </p>
<p>As the authors suggest “<em>The findings highlighted the importance of improving and maintaining adequate sleep duration as a public health target for obesity prevention”.</em> </p>
<p>A short sleep duration should therefore be recognized as a risk factor for obesity and must be taken into consideration for a healthy life balance.</p>
