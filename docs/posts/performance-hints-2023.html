<p>Original version: 2023/07/27, last updated: 2025/12/16</p>





<p>Over the years, we (Jeff &amp; Sanjay) have done a fair bit of diving into
performance tuning of various pieces of code, and improving the
performance of our software  has been important from the very earliest days of Google, since it
lets us do more for more users. We wrote this document as a way of identifying
some general principles and specific techniques that we use when doing this sort
of work, and tried to pick illustrative source code changes (change lists, or
CLs) that provide examples of the various approaches and techniques. Most of the
concrete suggestions below reference C++ types and CLs, but the general
principles apply to other languages. The document focuses on general performance
tuning in the context of a single binary, and does not cover distributed systems
or machine learning (ML) hardware performance tuning (huge areas unto
themselves). We hope others will find this useful.</p>

<p><em>Many of the examples in the document have code fragments that demonstrate the
techniques (click the little triangles!).</em> <em>Note that some of these
code fragments mention various internal Google codebase abstractions. We have
included these anyway if we felt like the examples were self-contained enough to
be understandable to those unfamiliar with the details of those abstractions.</em></p>

<h2 id="the-importance-of-thinking-about-performance">The importance of thinking about performance</h2>

<p>Knuth is often quoted out of context as saying <em>premature optimization is the
root of all evil</em>. The
<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/356635.356640">full quote</a> reads: <em>“We
should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature
optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our
opportunities in that critical 3%.”</em> This document is about that critical
3%, and a more compelling quote,
again from Knuth, reads:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The improvement in speed from Example 2 to Example 2a is only about 12%, and
many people would pronounce that insignificant. The conventional wisdom shared
by many of today’s software engineers calls for ignoring efficiency in the
small; but I believe this is simply an overreaction to the abuses they see
being practiced by penny-wise-and-pound-foolish programmers, who can’t debug
or maintain their “optimized” programs. In established engineering disciplines
a 12% improvement, easily obtained, is never considered marginal; and I
believe the same viewpoint should prevail in software engineering. Of course I
wouldn’t bother making such optimizations on a one-shot job, but when it’s a
question of preparing quality programs, I don’t want to restrict myself to
tools that deny me such efficiencies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many people will say “let’s write down the code in as simple a way as possible
and deal with performance later when we can profile”. However, this approach is
often wrong:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you disregard all performance concerns when developing a large system,
you will end up with a flat profile where there are no obvious hotspots
because performance is lost all over the place. It will be difficult to
figure out how to get started on performance improvements.</li>
  <li>If you are developing a library that will be used by other people, the
people who will run into performance problems will be likely to be people
who cannot easily make performance improvements (they will have to
understand the details of code written by other people/teams, and have to
negotiate with them about the importance of performance optimizations).</li>
  <li>It is harder to make significant changes to a system when it is in heavy
use.</li>
  <li>It is also hard to tell if there are performance problems that can be solved
easily and so we end up with potentially expensive solutions like
over-replication or severe overprovisioning of a service to handle load
problems.</li>
</ol>

<p>Instead, we suggest that when writing code, try to choose the faster alternative
if it does not impact readability/complexity of the code significantly.</p>

<h2 id="estimation">Estimation</h2>

<p>If you can develop an intuition for how much performance might matter in the
code you are writing, you can make a more informed decision (e.g., how much
extra complexity is warranted in the name of performance). Some tips on
estimating performance while you are writing code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is it test code? If so, you need to worry mostly about the asymptotic
complexity of your algorithms and data structures. (Aside: development cycle
time matters, so avoid writing tests that take a long time to run.)</li>
  <li>Is it code specific to an application? If so, try to figure out how much
performance matters for this piece of code. This is typically not very hard:
just figuring out whether code is initialization/setup code vs. code that
will end up on hot paths (e.g., processing every request in a service) is
often sufficient</li>
  <li>Is it library code that will be used by many applications? In this case it
is hard to tell how sensitive it might become. This is where it becomes
especially important to follow some of the simple techniques described in
this document. For example, if you need to store a vector that usually has a
small number of elements, use an absl::InlinedVector instead of std::vector.
Such techniques are not very hard to follow and don’t add any non-local
complexity to the system. And if it turns out that the code you are writing
does end up using significant resources, it will be higher performance from
the start. And it will be easier to find the next thing to focus on when
looking at a profile.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can do a slightly deeper analysis when picking between options with
potentially different performance characteristics by relying on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation">back of the envelope calculations</a>.
Such calculations can quickly give a very rough estimate of the performance of
different alternatives, and the results can be used to discard some of the
alternatives without having to implement them.</p>

<p>Here is how such an estimation might work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Estimate how many low-level operations of various kinds are required, e.g.,
number of disk seeks, number of network round-trips, bytes transmitted etc.</li>
  <li>Multiply each kind of expensive operation with its rough cost, and add the
results together.</li>
  <li>The preceding gives the <em>cost</em> of the system in terms of resource usage. If
you are interested in latency, and if the system has any concurrency, some
of the costs may overlap and you may have to do slightly more complicated
analysis to estimate the latency.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following table, which is an updated version of a table from a
<a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//people/jeff/stanford-295-talk.pdf">2007 talk at Stanford University</a>
(video of the 2007 talk no longer exists, but there is a
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=modXC5IWTJI">video of a related 2011 Stanford talk that covers some of the same content</a>)
may be useful since it lists the types of operations to consider, and their
rough cost:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>L1 cache reference                             0.5 ns
L2 cache reference                             3 ns
Branch mispredict                              5 ns
Mutex lock/unlock (uncontended)               15 ns
Main memory reference                         50 ns
Compress 1K bytes with Snappy              1,000 ns
Read 4KB from SSD                         20,000 ns
Round trip within same datacenter         50,000 ns
Read 1MB sequentially from memory         64,000 ns
Read 1MB over 100 Gbps network           100,000 ns

Send packet CA-&gt;Netherlands-&gt;CA      150,000,000 ns
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The preceding table contains rough costs for some basic low-level operations.
You may find it useful to also track estimated costs for higher-level operations
relevant to your system. E.g., you might want to know the rough cost of a point
read from your SQL database, the latency of interacting with a Cloud service, or
the time to render a simple HTML page. If you don’t know the relevant cost of
different operations, you can’t do decent back-of-the-envelope calculations!</p>

<h3 id="example-time-to-quicksort-a-billion-4-byte-numbers">Example: Time to quicksort a billion 4 byte numbers</h3>

<p>As a rough approximation, a good quicksort algorithm makes log(N) passes over an
array of size N. On each pass, the array contents will be streamed from memory
into the processor cache, and the partition code will compare each element once
to a pivot element. Let’s add up the dominant costs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Memory bandwidth: the array occupies 4 GB (4 bytes per number times a
billion numbers). Let’s assume ~16GB/s of memory bandwidth per core. That
means each pass will take ~0.25s. N is ~2^30, so we will make ~30 passes, so
the total cost of memory transfer will be ~7.5 seconds.</li>
  <li>Branch mispredictions: we will do a total of N*log(N) comparisons, i.e., ~30
billion comparisons. Let’s assume that half of them (i.e., 15 billion) are
mispredicted. Multiplying by 5 ns per misprediction, we get a misprediction
cost of 75 seconds. We assume for this analysis that correctly predicted
branches are free.</li>
  <li>Adding up the previous numbers, we get an estimate of ~82.5 seconds.</li>
</ol>

<p>If necessary, we could refine our analysis to account for processor caches. This
refinement is probably not needed since branch mispredictions are the dominant
cost according to the analysis above, but we include it here anyway as another
example. Let’s assume we have a 32MB L3 cache, and that the cost of transferring
data from L3 cache to the processor is negligible. The L3 cache can hold 2^23
numbers, and therefore the last 22 passes can operate on the data resident in
the L3 cache (the 23rd last pass brings data into the L3 cache and the remaining
passes operate on that data.) That cuts down the memory transfer cost to 2.5
seconds (10 memory transfers of 4GB at 16GB/s) instead of 7.5 seconds (30 memory
transfers).</p>

<h3 id="example-time-to-generate-a-web-page-with-30-image-thumbnails">Example: Time to generate a web page with 30 image thumbnails</h3>

<p>Let’s compare two potential designs where the original images are stored on
disk, and each image is approximately 1MB in size.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Read the contents of the 30 images serially and generate a thumbnail for
each one. Each read takes one seek + one transfer, which adds up to 5ms for
the seek, and 10ms for the transfer, which adds up to 30 images times 15ms
per image, i.e., 450ms.</li>
  <li>Read in parallel, assuming the images are spread evenly across K disks. The
previous resource usage estimate still holds, but latency will drop by
roughly a factor of K, ignoring variance (e.g, we will sometimes get unlucky
and one disk will have more than 1/Kth of the images we are reading).
Therefore if we are running on a distributed filesystem with hundreds of
disks, the expected latency will drop to ~15ms.</li>
  <li>Let’s consider a variant where all images are on a single SSD. This changes
the sequential read performance to 20µs + 1ms per image, which adds up to
~30 ms overall.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="measurement">Measurement</h2>

<p>The preceding section gives some tips about how to think about performance when
writing code without worrying too much about how to measure the performance
impact of your choices. However, before you actually start making improvements,
or run into a tradeoff involving various things like performance, simplicity,
etc. you will want to measure or estimate potential performance benefits. Being
able to measure things effectively is the number one tool you’ll want to have in
your arsenal when doing performance-related work.</p>

<p>As an aside, it’s worth pointing out that profiling code that you’re unfamiliar
with can also be a good way of getting a general sense of the structure of the
codebase and how it operates. Examining the source code of heavily involved
routines in the dynamic call graph of a program can give you a high level sense
of “what happens” when running the code, which can then build your own
confidence in making performance-improving changes in slightly unfamiliar code.</p>

<h3 id="profiling-tools-and-tips">Profiling tools and tips</h3>

<p>Many useful profiling tools are available. A useful tool to reach for first is
<a href="https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/main/doc/README.md">pprof</a> since it gives
good high level performance information and is easy to use both locally and for
code running in production. Also try
<a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">perf</a> if you want more
detailed insight into performance.</p>

<p>Some tips for profiling:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build production binaries with appropriate debugging information and
optimization flags.</li>
  <li>If you can, write a <a href="https://abseil.io/fast/75">microbenchmark</a> that covers the code you are
improving. Microbenchmarks improve turnaround time when making performance
improvements, help verify the impact of performance improvements, and can
help prevent future performance regressions. However microbenchmarks can
have <a href="https://abseil.io/fast/39">pitfalls</a> that make them non-representative of full system
performance. Useful libraries for writing microbenchmarks:
<a href="https://github.com/google/benchmark/blob/main/README.md">C++</a> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/testing#hdr-Benchmarks">Go</a> <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jmh">Java</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Use a benchmark library to <a href="https://abseil.io/fast/53">emit performance counter readings</a> both
for better precision, and to get more insight into program behavior.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Lock contention can often artificially lower CPU usage. Some mutex
implementations provide support for profiling lock contention.</li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_profiling_keras#debug_performance_bottlenecks">ML profilers</a> for machine learning performance work .</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-to-do-when-profiles-are-flat">What to do when profiles are flat</h3>

<p>You will often run into situations where your CPU profile is flat (there is no
obvious big contributor to slowness). This can often happen when all low-hanging
fruit has been picked. Here are some tips to consider if you find yourself in
this situation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t discount the value of many small optimizations! Making twenty separate
1% improvements in some subsystem is often eminently possible and
collectively mean a pretty sizable improvement (work of this flavor often
relies on having stable and high quality microbenchmarks). Some examples of
these sorts of changes are in the
<a href="#cls-that-demonstrate-multiple-techniques">changes that demonstrate multiple techniques</a>
section.</li>
  <li>Find loops closer to the top of call stacks (flame graph view of a CPU
profile can be helpful here). Potentially, the loop or the code it calls
could be restructured to be more efficient. Some code that initially built a
complicated graph structure incrementally by looping over nodes and edges of
the input was changed to build the graph structure in one shot by passing it
the entire input. This removed a bunch of internal checks that were
happening per edge in the initial code.</li>
  <li>Take a step back and look for structural changes higher up in the call
stacks instead of concentrating on micro-optimizations. The techniques
listed under <a href="#algorithmic-improvements">algorithmic improvements</a> can be
useful when doing this.</li>
  <li>Look for overly general code. Replace it with a customized or lower-level
implementation. E.g., if an application is repeatedly using a regular
expression match where a simple prefix match would suffice, consider
dropping the use of the regular expression.</li>
  <li>Attempt to reduce the number of allocations:
<a href="https://gperftools.github.io/gperftools/heapprofile.html">get an allocation profile</a>, and pick away at the highest
contributor to the number of allocations. This will have two effects: (1) It
will provide a direct reduction of the amount of time spent in the allocator
(and garbage collector for GC-ed languages) (2) There will often be a
reduction in cache misses since in a long running program using tcmalloc,
every allocation tends to go to a different cache line.</li>
  <li>Gather other types of profiles, specially ones based on hardware performance
counters. Such profiles may point out functions that are encountering a high
cache miss rate. Techniques described in the
<a href="#profiling-tools-and-tips">profiling tools and tips</a> section can be
helpful.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="api-considerations">API considerations</h2>

<p>Some of the techniques suggested below require changing data structures and
function signatures, which may be disruptive to callers. Try to organize code so
that the suggested performance improvements can be made inside an encapsulation
boundary without affecting public interfaces. This will be easier if your
<a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php">modules are deep</a>
(significant functionality accessed via a narrow interface).</p>

<p>Widely used APIs come under heavy pressure to add features. Be
careful when adding new features since these will constrain future
implementations and increase cost unnecessarily for users who don’t need the new
features. E.g., many C++ standard library containers promise iterator stability,
which in typical implementations increases the number of allocations
significantly, even though many users do not need pointer stability.</p>

<p>Some specific techniques are listed below. Consider carefully the performance
benefits vs. any API usability issues introduced by such changes.</p>

<h3 id="bulk-apis">Bulk APIs</h3>

of algorithmic improvements.</p>

<h3 id="view-types">View types</h3>

<p>Prefer view types (e.g., <code>std::string_view</code>, <code>std::Span&lt;T&gt;</code>,
<code>absl::FunctionRef&lt;R(Args...)&gt;</code>) for function arguments (unless ownership of the

<p>For frequently called routines, sometimes it is useful to allow higher-level

being forced to allocate its own temporary data structure or recompute

<p>However if the typical use of a type needs synchronization, prefer to move the
synchronization inside the type. This allows the synchronization mechanism to be
tweaked as necessary to improve performance (e.g., sharding to reduce
contention) without affecting callers.</p>

<h2 id="algorithmic-improvements">Algorithmic improvements</h2>

<p>The most critical opportunities for performance improvements come from
algorithmic improvements, e.g., turning an O(N²) algorithm to O(N lg(N)) or
O(N), avoiding potentially exponential behavior, etc. These opportunities are
rare in stable code, but are worth paying attention to when writing new code. A
few examples that show such improvements to pre-existing code:</p>

<summary><p>Replace the deadlock detection system built into a mutex
implementation with a better algorithm.</p>
</summary>

<p>Replaced deadlock detection algorithm by one that is ~50x as fast and scales to
millions of mutexes without problem (the old algorithm relied on a 2K limit to
avoid a performance cliff). The new code is based on the following paper: A
dynamic topological sort algorithm for directed acyclic graphs David J. Pearce,
Paul H. J. Kelly Journal of Experimental Algorithmics (JEA) JEA Homepage archive
Volume 11, 2006, Article No. 1.7</p>
<p>The new algorithm takes O(|V|+|E|) space (instead of the O(|V|^2) bits needed by
the older algorithm). Lock-acquisition order graphs are very sparse, so this is
much less space. The algorithm is also quite simple: the core of it is ~100
lines of C++. Since the code now scales to much larger number of Mutexes, we
were able to relax an artificial 2K limit, which uncovered a number of latent
deadlocks in real programs.</p>
<p>Benchmark results: these were run in DEBUG mode since deadlock detection is
mainly enabled in debug mode. The benchmark argument (/2k etc.) is the number of
tracked nodes. At the default 2k limit of the old algorithm, the new algorithm
takes only 0.5 microseconds per InsertEdge compared to 22 microseconds for the
old algorithm. The new algorithm also easily scales to much larger graphs
without problems whereas the old algorithm keels over quickly.</p>

<h2 id="better-memory-representation">Better memory representation</h2>

<p>Careful consideration of memory footprint and cache footprint of important data
structures can often yield big savings. The data structures below focus on
supporting common operations by touching fewer cache lines. Care taken here can
(a) avoid expensive cache misses (b) reduce memory bus traffic, which speeds up
both the program in question and anything else running on the same machine. They
rely on some common techniques you may find useful when designing your own data
structures.</p>

<h3 id="compact-data-structures">Compact data structures</h3>

<p>Use compact representations for data that will be accessed often or that
comprises a large portion of the application’s memory usage. A compact
representation can significantly reduce memory usage and improve performance by
touching fewer cache lines and reducing memory bus bandwidth usage. However,
watch out for <a href="#reduce-false-sharing">cache-line contention</a>.</p>

<h3 id="memory-layout">Memory layout</h3>

<p>Carefully consider the memory layout of types that have a large memory or cache
footprint.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reorder fields to reduce padding between fields with different alignment
requirements (see
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9989164/optimizing-memory-layout-of-class-instances-in-c">class layout discussion</a>).</li>
  <li>Use smaller numeric types where the stored data will fit in the smaller
type.</li>
  <li>Enum values sometimes take up a whole word unless you’re careful. Consider
using a smaller representation (e.g., use <code>enum class OpType : uint8_t { ...
}</code> instead of <code>enum class OpType { ... }</code>).</li>
  <li>Order fields so that fields that are frequently accessed together are closer
to each other – this will reduce the number of cache lines touched on common
operations.</li>
  <li>Place hot read-only fields away from hot mutable fields so that writes to
the mutable fields do not cause the read-only fields to be evicted from
nearby caches.</li>
  <li>Move cold data so it does not live next to hot data, either by placing the
cold data at the end of the struct, or behind a level of indirection, or in
a separate array.</li>
  <li>Consider packing things into fewer bytes by using bit and byte-level
encoding. This can be complicated, so only do this when the data under
question is encapsulated inside a well-tested module, and the overall
reduction of memory usage is significant. Furthermore, watch out for side
effects like under-alignment of frequently used data, or more expensive code
for accessing packed representations. Validate such changes using
benchmarks.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="indices-instead-of-pointers">Indices instead of pointers</h3>

<p>On modern 64-bit machines, pointers take up 64 bits. If you have a pointer-rich
data structure, you can easily chew up lots of memory with indirections of T*.
Instead, consider using integer indices into an array T[] or other data
structure. Not only will the references be smaller (if the number of indices is
small enough to fit in 32 or fewer bits), but the storage for all the T[]
elements will be contiguous, often leading to better cache locality.</p>

<h3 id="batched-storage">Batched storage</h3>

<p>Avoid data structures that allocate a separate object per stored element (e.g.,
<code>std::map</code>, <code>std::unordered_map</code> in C++). Instead, consider types that use
chunked or flat representations to store multiple elements in close proximity in
memory (e.g., <code>std::vector</code>, <code>absl::flat_hash_{map,set}</code> in C++). Such types
tend to have much better cache behavior. Furthermore, they encounter less
allocator overhead.</p>

<p>One useful technique is to partition elements into chunks where each chunk can
hold a fixed number of elements. This technique can reduce the cache footprint
of a data structure significantly while preserving good asymptotic behavior.</p>

<p>For some data structures, a single chunk suffices to hold all elements (e.g.,
strings and vectors). Other types (e.g., <code>absl::flat_hash_map</code>) also use this
technique.</p>

<h3 id="inlined-storage">Inlined storage</h3>

<p>Some container types are optimized for storing a small number of elements. These
types provide space for a small number of elements at the top level and
completely avoid allocations when the number of elements is small. This can be
very helpful when instances of such types are constructed often (e.g., as stack
variables in frequently executed code), or if many instances are live at the
same time. If a container will typically contain a small number of elements
consider using one of the inlined storage types, e.g., InlinedVector.</p>

<p>Caveat: if <code>sizeof(T)</code> is large, inlined storage containers may not be the best
choice since the inlined backing store will be large.</p>

<h3 id="unnecessarily-nested-maps">Unnecessarily nested maps</h3>

<p>Sometimes a nested map data structure can be replaced with a single-level map
with a compound key. This can reduce the cost of lookups and insertions
significantly.</p>

<details>

<p>Caveat: if the first map key is big, it might be better to stick with nested
maps:</p>

<details>
<summary><p>Switch to a nested map leads to 76% performance
improvement in microbenchmark.</p>
</summary>

<p>We previously had a single-level hash table where the key consisted of a
(string) path and some other numeric sub-keys. Each path occurred in
approximately 1000 keys on average. We split the hash table into two levels
where the first level was keyed by the path and each second level hash table
kept just the sub-key to data mapping for a particular path. This reduced the
memory usage for storing paths by a factor of 1000, and also sped up accesses
where many sub-keys for the same path were accessed together.</p>

</details>

<h3 id="arenas">Arenas</h3>

<p>Arenas can help reduce memory allocation cost, but they also have the benefit of
packing together independently allocated items next to each other, typically in
fewer cache lines, and eliminating most destruction costs. They are likely most
effective for complex data structures with many sub-objects. Consider providing
an appropriate initial size for the arena since that can help reduce
allocations.</p>

<p>Caveat: it is easy to misuse arenas by putting too many short-lived objects in a
long-lived arena, which can unnecessarily bloat memory footprint.</p>

<h3 id="arrays-instead-of-maps">Arrays instead of maps</h3>

<p>If the domain of a map can be represented by a small integer or is an enum, or
if the map will have very few elements, the map can sometimes be replaced by an
array or a vector of some form.</p>

<p>Caveat: Do not use <code>resize</code> or <code>reserve</code> to grow one element at a time since
that may lead to quadratic behavior. Also, if element construction is expensive,
prefer an initial <code>reserve</code> call followed by several <code>push_back</code> or
<code>emplace_back</code> calls instead of an initial <code>resize</code> since that will double the
number of constructor calls.</p>

<h3 id="avoid-copying-when-possible">Avoid copying when possible</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Prefer moving to copying data structures when possible.</li>
  <li>If lifetime is not an issue, store pointers or indices instead of copies of
objects in transient data structures. E.g., if a local map is used to select
a set of protos from an incoming list of protos, we can make the map store
just pointers to the incoming protos instead of copying potentially deeply
nested data. Another common example is sorting a vector of indices rather
than sorting a vector of large objects directly since the latter would incur
significant copying/moving costs.</li>

<p>Caveat: protobuf, string, vector, containers etc. tend to grow to the size of
the largest value ever stored in them. Therefore reconstructing them
periodically (e.g., after every N uses) can help reduce memory requirements and
reinitialization costs.</p>

<h2 id="avoid-unnecessary-work">Avoid unnecessary work</h2>

<p>Perhaps one of the most effective categories of improving performance is
avoiding work you don’t have to do. This can take many forms, including creating
specialized paths through code for common cases that avoid more general
expensive computation, precomputation, deferring work until it is really needed,
hoisting work into less-frequently executed pieces of code, and other similar
approaches. Below are many examples of this general approach, categorized into a
few representative categories.</p>

<h3 id="fast-paths-for-common-cases">Fast paths for common cases</h3>

<p>Often, code is written to cover all cases, but some subset of the cases are much
simpler and more common than others. E.g., <code>vector::push_back</code> usually has
enough space for the new element, but contains code to resize the underlying
storage when it does not. Some attention paid to the structure of code can help
make the common simple case faster without hurting uncommon case performance
significantly.</p>

<details>
<summary><p>Make fast path cover more common cases.</p>

<p>Add handling of trailing single ASCII bytes, rather than only handling multiples
of four bytes with this routine. This avoids calling the slower generic routine
for all-ASCII strings that are, for example, 5 bytes.</p>

<summary><p>Change search order for 19% throughput improvement.</p>
</summary>

<p>An old search system (circa 2000) had two tiers: one contained a full-text
index, and the other tier contained just the index for the title and anchor
terms. We used to search the smaller title/anchor tier first.
Counter-intuitively, we found that it is cheaper to search the larger full-text
index tier first since if we reach the end of the full-text tier, we can
entirely skip searching the title/anchor tier (a subset of the full-text tier).
This happened reasonably often and allowed us to reduce the average number of
disk seeks to process a query.</p>
<p>See discussion of title and anchor text handling in
<a href="https://research.google/pubs/the-anatomy-of-a-large-scale-hypertextual-web-search-engine/">The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine</a>

<h3 id="make-the-compilers-job-easier">Make the compiler’s job easier</h3>

<p>The compiler may have trouble optimizing through layers of abstractions because
it must make conservative assumptions about the overall behavior of the code, or
may not make the right speed vs. size tradeoffs. The application programmer will
often know more about the behavior of the system and can aid the compiler by
rewriting the code to operate at a lower level. However, only do this when
profiles show an issue since compilers will often get things right on their own.
Looking at the generated assembly code for performance critical routines can
help you understand if the compiler is “getting it right”. Pprof provides a very
helpful <a href="https://github.com/google/pprof/blob/main/doc/README.md#annotated-source-code">display of source code interleaved with disassembly</a>
and annotated with performance data.</p>

<p>Some techniques that may be useful:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Avoid functions calls in hot functions (allows the compiler to avoid frame
setup costs).</li>
  <li>Move slow-path code into a separate tail-called function.</li>
  <li>Copy small amounts of data into local variables before heavy use. This can
let the compiler assume there is no aliasing with other data, which may
improve auto-vectorization and register allocation.</li>
  <li>Hand-unroll very hot loops.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="code-size-considerations">Code size considerations</h2>

<p>Performance encompasses more than just runtime speed. Sometimes it is worth
considering the effects of software choices on the size of generated code. Large
code size means longer compile and link times, bloated binaries, more memory
usage, more icache pressure, and other sometimes negative effects on
microarchitectural structures like branch predictors, etc.  Thinking about these issues is especially
important when writing low-level library code that will be used in many places,
or when writing templated code that you expect will be instantiated for many
different types.</p>

<p>The techniques that are useful for reducing code size vary significantly across
programming languages. Here are some techniques that we have found useful for
C++ code (which can suffer from an over-use of templates and inlining).</p>

<h3 id="inline-with-care">Inline with care</h3>

<details>
<summary><p>Reduce inlining in TensorFlow.</p>

<p>The change stops inlining many non-performance-sensitive functions (e.g., error
paths and op registration code). Furthermore, slow paths of some
performance-sensitive functions are moved into non-inlined functions.</p>
<p>These changes reduces the size of tensorflow symbols in a typical binary by
12.2% (8814545 bytes down to 7740233 bytes)</p>

performance costs. For example, a piece of code that fills in a list of 1000

converted from protobufs to a C++ std::vector of structs!</p>

</details>

<p>In addition, the protobuf version adds a few kilobytes of code and data to the
binary, which may not seem like much, but adds up quickly in systems with many
protobuf types. This increased size creates performance problems by creating
i-cache and d-cache pressure.</p>

<p>Here are some tips related to protobuf performance:</p>

<details>
<summary><p>Do not use protobufs unnecessarily.</p>
</summary>

<p>Given the factor of 20 performance difference described above, if some data is
never serialized or parsed, you probably should not put it in a protocol buffer.
The purpose of protocol buffers is to make it easy to serialize and deserialize
data structures, but they can have significant code-size, memory, and CPU
overheads. Do not use them if all you want are some of the other niceties like
<code>DebugString</code> and copyability.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>Avoid unnecessary message hierarchies.</p>
</summary>

<p>Message hierarchy can be useful to organize information in a more readable
fashion. However, the extra level of message hierarchy incurs overheads like
memory allocations, function calls, cache misses, larger serialized messages,
etc.</p>
<p>E.g., instead of:</p>
<pre><code>message Foo {
  optional Bar bar = 1;
}
message Bar {
  optional Baz baz = 1;
}
message Baz {
  optional int32 count = 1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Prefer:</p>
<pre><code>message Foo {
  optional int32 count = 1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A protocol buffer message corresponds to a message class in C++ generated code
and emits a tag and the length of the payload on the wire. To carry an integer,
the old form requires more allocations (and deallocations) and emits a larger
amount of generated code. As a result, all protocol buffer operations (parsing,
serialization, size, etc.) become more expensive, having to traverse the message
tree. The new form does not have such overhead and is more efficient.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>Use small field numbers for frequently occurring fields.</p>
</summary>

<p>Protobufs use a variable length integer representation for the combination of
field number and wire format (see the
<a href="https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/">protobuf encoding documentation</a>).
This representation is 1 byte for field numbers between 1 and 15, and two bytes
for field numbers between 16 and 2047. (Field numbers 2048 or greater should
typically be avoided.)</p>
<p>Consider pre-reserving some small field numbers for future extension of
performance-sensitive protobufs.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>Choose carefully between int32, sint32, fixed32, and uint32 (and
similarly for the 64 bit variants).</p>
</summary>

<p>Generally, use <code>int32</code> or <code>int64</code>, but use <code>fixed32</code> or <code>fixed64</code> for large
values like hash codes and <code>sint32</code> or <code>sint64</code> for values are that are often
negative.</p>
<p>A varint occupies fewer bytes to encode small integers and can save space at the
cost of more expensive decoding. However, it can take up more space for negative
or large values. In that case, using fixed32 or fixed64 (instead of uint32 or
uint64) reduces size with much cheaper encoding and decoding. For small negative
integers, use sint32 or sint64 instead of int32 or int64.d</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>For proto2, pack repeated numeric fields by annotating them with
<code>[packed=true]</code>.</p>
</summary>

<p>In proto2, repeated values are serialized as a sequence of (tag, value) pairs by
default. This is inefficient because tags have to be decoded for every element.</p>
<p>Packed repeated primitives are serialized with the length of the payload first
followed by values without tags. When using fixed-width values, we can avoid
reallocations by knowing the final size the moment we start parsing; i.e., no
reallocation cost. We still don&#39;t know how many varints are in the payload and
may have to pay the reallocation cost.</p>
<p>In proto3, repeated fields are packed by default.</p>
<p>Packed works best with fixed-width values like fixed32, fixed64, float, double,
etc. since the entire encoded length can be predetermined by multiplying the
number of elements by the fixed value size, instead of having to calculate the
length of each individual element.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>Use <code>bytes</code> instead for <code>string</code> for binary data
and large values.</p>
</summary>

<p>The <code>string</code> type holds UTF8-encoded text, and can sometimes require validation.
The <code>bytes</code> type can hold an arbitrary sequence of bytes (non-text data) and is
often more appropriate as well as more efficient than <code>string</code>.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>Consider <code>string_type = VIEW</code> to avoid copying.</p>
</summary>

<p>Copying a big string or bytes field during parsing is expensive. Such cost can
often be avoided by marking the field with <code>string_type = VIEW</code>.</p>
<pre><code>message Image {
  ...
  bytes jpeg_encoding = 4 [features.(pb.cpp).string_type=VIEW];
}
</code></pre>
<p>Without the <code>VIEW</code> annotation, when the protocol buffer is parsed, the
potentially large field contents are copied from the serialized protocol buffer
to a string object in memory. Depending on the number of string or bytes fields
and the size of those fields, the overhead of copying can be significant.</p>
<p>Instead of copying the big binary blobs, routines like
<code>ParseFromStringWithAliasing</code> use <code>absl::string_view</code> to reference the original
backing string. Note that the backing string (the serialized protocol buffer)
must outlive the protocol buffer instance that contains the alias.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>Consider using <code>Cord</code> for large fields to reduce copying
costs.</p>
</summary>

<p>Annotating large <code>bytes</code> and <code>string</code> fields with <code>[ctype=CORD]</code> may reduce
copying costs. This annotation changes the representation of the field from
<code>std::string</code> to <code>absl::Cord</code>. <code>absl::Cord</code> uses reference counting and
tree-based storage to reduce copying and appending costs. If a protocol buffer
is serialized to a cord, parsing a string or bytes field with <code>[ctype=CORD]</code> can
avoid copying the field contents.</p>
<pre><code>message Document {
  ...
  bytes html = 4 [ctype = CORD];
}
</code></pre>
<p>Performance of a Cord field depends on length distribution and access patterns.
Use benchmarks to validate such changes.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>Use protobuf arenas in C++ code.</p>
</summary>

<p>Consider using arenas to save allocation and deallocation costs, especially for
protobufs containing repeated, string, or message fields.</p>
<p>Message and string fields are heap-allocated (even if the top-level protocol
buffer object is stack-allocated). If a protocol buffer message has a lot of sub
message fields and string fields, allocation and deallocation cost can be
significant. Arenas amortize allocation costs and makes deallocation virtually
free. It also improves memory locality by allocating from contiguous chunks of
memory.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>Keep .proto files small</p>
</summary>

<p>Do not put too many messages in a single .proto file. Once you rely on anything
at all from a .proto file, the entire file will get pulled in by the linker even
if it&#39;s mostly unused. This increases build times and binary sizes. You can use
extensions and <code>Any</code> to avoid creating hard dependencies on big
.proto files with many message types.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>Consider storing protocol buffers in serialized form, even in memory.</p>
</summary>

<p>In-memory protobuf objects have a large memory footprint (often 5x the wire
format size), potentially spread across many cache lines. So if your application
is going to keep many protobuf objects live for long periods of time, consider
storing them in serialized form.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>Avoid protobuf map fields.</p>
</summary>

<p>Protobuf map fields have performance problems that usually outweigh the small
syntactic convenience they provide. Prefer using non-protobuf maps initialized
from protobuf contents:</p>
<p>msg.proto</p>
<pre><code>map&lt;string, bytes&gt; env_variables = 5;
</code></pre>
<pre><code>message Var {
  string key = 1;
  bytes value = 2;
}
repeated Var env_variables = 5;
</code></pre>

</details>

<details>
<summary><p>Use protobuf message definition with a subset of the fields.</p>
</summary>

<p>If you want to access only a few fields of a large message type, consider
defining your own protocol buffer message type that mimics the original type,
but only defines the fields that you care about. Here&#39;s an example:</p>
<pre><code>message FullMessage {
  optional int32 field1 = 1;
  optional BigMessage field2 = 2;
  optional int32 field3 = 3;
  repeater AnotherBigMessage field4 = 4;
  ...
  optional int32 field100 = 100;
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>message SubsetMessage {
  optional int32 field3 = 3;
  optional int32 field88 = 88;
}

<h3 id="abslbtree_mapabslbtree_set">absl::btree_map/absl::btree_set</h3>

<p>absl::btree_map and absl::btree_set store multiple entries per tree node. This
has a number of advantages over ordered C++ standard library containers such as
<code>std::map</code>. First, the pointer overhead of pointing to child tree nodes is often
significantly reduced. Second, because the entries or key/values are stored
consecutively in memory for a given btree tree node, cache efficiency is often
significantly better.</p>

<h3 id="gtlsmall_ordered_set">gtl::small_ordered_set</h3>

<p>gtl::small_ordered_set is an optimization for associative containers (such as
std::set or absl::btree_multiset). It uses a fixed array to store a certain
number of elements, then reverts to using a set or multiset when it runs out of
space. For sets that are typically small, this can be considerably faster than
using something like set directly, as set is optimized for large data sets. This
change shrinks cache footprint and reduces critical section length.</p>

<summary><p>Encode groups of 4 k-bit numbers at a time.</p>
</summary>

<p>Added KBitStreamEncoder and KBitStreamDecoder classes to encode/decode 4 k-bit
numbers at a time into a bit stream. Since K is known at compile time, the
encoding and decoding can be quite efficient. E.g., since four numbers are
encoded at a time, the code can assume that the stream is always byte-aligned
(for even k), or nibble-aligned (for odd k).</p>

<h2 id="cls-that-demonstrate-multiple-techniques">CLs that demonstrate multiple techniques</h2>

<p>Sometimes a single CL contains a number of performance-improving changes that
use many of the preceding techniques. Looking at the kinds of changes in these
CLs is sometimes a good way to get in the mindset of making general changes to
speed up the performance of some part of a system after that has been identified
as a bottleneck.</p>

<details>
<summary><p>Speed up GPU memory allocator by ~40%.</p>
</summary>

<p>36-48% speedup in allocation/deallocation speed for GPUBFCAllocator:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Identify chunks by a handle number, rather than by a pointer to a Chunk.
Chunk data structures are now allocated in a <code>vector&lt;Chunk&gt;</code>, and a handle
is an index into this vector to refer to a particular chunk. This allows the
next and prev pointers in Chunk to be ChunkHandle (4 bytes), rather than
<code>Chunk*</code> (8 bytes).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a Chunk object is no longer in use, we maintain a free list of Chunk
objects, whose head is designated by ChunkHandle <code>free_chunks_list_</code>, and
with the <code>Chunk-&gt;next</code> pointing to the next free list entry. Together with
(1), this allows us to avoid heap allocation/deallocation of Chunk objects
in the allocator, except (rarely) when the <code>vector&lt;Chunk&gt;</code> grows. It also
makes all the memory for Chunk objects contiguous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rather than having the bins_ data structure be a std::set and using
lower_bound to locate the appropriate bin given a byte_size, we instead have
an array of bins, indexed by a function that is log₂(byte_size/256). This
allows the bin to be located with a few bit operations, rather than a binary
search tree lookup. It also allows us to allocate the storage for all the
Bin data structures in a contiguous array, rather than in many different
cache lines. This reduces the number of cache lines that must be moved
around between cores when multiple threads are doing allocations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added fast path to GPUBFCAllocator::AllocateRaw that first tries to allocate
memory without involving the retry_helper_. If an initial attempt fails
(returns nullptr), then we go through the retry_helper_, but normally we can
avoid several levels of procedure calls as well as the
allocation/deallocation of a std::function with several arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commented out most of the VLOG calls. These can be reenabled selectively
when needed for debugging purposes by uncommenting and recompiling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Added multi-threaded benchmark to test allocation under contention.</p>
<p>Speeds up ptb_word_lm on my desktop machine with a Titan X card from 8036 words
per second to 8272 words per second (+2.9%).</p>

<summary><p>Reduce XLA compilation time by ~31% by improving Shape
handling.</p>
</summary>

<p>Several changes to improve XLA compiler performance:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Improved performance of ShapeUtil::ForEachIndex... iteration in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In ShapeUtil::ForEachState, save just pointers to the arrays represented
by the spans, rather than the full span objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-form a ShapeUtil::ForEachState::indexes_span pointing at the
ShapeUtil::ForEachState::indexes vector, rather than constructing this
span from the vector on every loop iteration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save a ShapeUtil::ForEachState::indexes_ptr pointer to the backing store
of the ShapeUtil::ForEachState::indexes vector, allowing simple array
operations in ShapeUtil::ForEachState::IncrementDim(), rather than more
expensive vector::operator[] operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save a ShapeUtil::ForEachState::minor_to_major array pointer initialized
in the constructor by calling shape.layout().minor_to_major().data()
rather than calling LayoutUtil::Minor(...) for each dimension for each
iteration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inlined the ShapeUtil::ForEachState constructor and the
ShapeUtil::ForEachState::IncrementDim() routines</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved the performance of ShapeUtil::ForEachIndex iteration for call sites
that don&#39;t need the functionality of returning a Status in the passed in
function. Did this by introducing ShapeUtil::ForEachIndexNoStatus variants,
which accept a ForEachVisitorFunctionNoStatus (which returns a plain bool).
This is faster than the ShapeUtil::ForEachIndex routines, which accept a
ForEachVisitorFunction (which returns a <code>StatusOr&lt;bool&gt;</code>, which requires an
expensive <code>StatusOr&lt;bool&gt;</code> destructor call per element that we iterate
over).</p>
<ul>
<li>Used this variant of ShapeUtil::ForEachIndexNoStatus in
LiteralBase::Broadcast and GenerateReduceOutputElement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improved performance of LiteralBase::Broadcast in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Introduced templated BroadcastHelper routine in literal.cc that is
specialized for different primitive byte sizes (without this,
primitive_size was a runtime variable and so the compiler couldn&#39;t do a
very good job of optimizing the memcpy that occurred per element, and
would invoke the general memcpy path that assumes the byte count is
fairly large, even though in our case it is a tiny power of 2 (typically
1, 2, 4, or 8)).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoided all but one of ~(5 + num_dimensions + num_result_elements)
virtual calls per Broadcast call by making a single call to &#39;shape()&#39; at
the beginning of the LiteralBase::Broadcast routine. The innocuous
looking &#39;shape()&#39; calls that were sprinkled throughout end up boiling
down to &#34;root_piece().subshape()&#34;, where subshape() is a virtual
function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the BroadcastHelper routine, Special-cased the source dimensions
being one and avoided a call to
IndexUtil::MultiDimensionalIndexToLinearIndex for this case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In BroadcastHelper, used a scratch_source_array pointer variable that
points into the backing store of the scratch_source_index vector, and
used that directly to avoid vector::operator[] operations inside the
per-element code. Also pre-computed a scratch_source_span that points to
the scratch_source_index vector outside the per-element loop in
BroadcastHelper, to avoid constructing a span from the vector on each
element.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Introduced new three-argument variant of
IndexUtil::MultiDimensionalIndexToLinearIndex where the caller passes in
the minor_to_major span associated with the shape argument. Used this in
BroadcastHelper to compute this for the src and dst shapes once per
Broadcast, rather than once per element copied.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In ShardingPropagation::GetShardingFromUser, for the HloOpcode::kTuple case,
only call user.sharding().GetSubSharding(...) if we have found the operand
to be of interest. Avoiding calling it eagerly reduces CPU time in this
routine for one lengthy compilation from 43.7s to 2.0s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Added benchmarks for ShapeUtil::ForEachIndex and Literal::Broadcast and for
the new ShapeUtil::ForEachIndexNoStatus.</p>
</li>
</ol>

BM_ForEachIndex and BM_BroadcastVectorToMatrix (and BUILD file change to add
benchmark dependency), but no other changes.

<summary><p>MapReduce improvements (~2X speedup for wordcount
benchmark).</p>
</summary>

<p>Mapreduce speedups:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The combiner data structures for the SafeCombinerMapOutput class have been
changed. Rather than using a <code>hash_multimap&lt;SafeCombinerKey, StringPiece&gt;</code>,
which had a hash table entry for each unique key/value inserted in the
table, we instead use a <code>hash_map&lt;SafeCombinerKey, ValuePtr*&gt;</code> (where
ValuePtr is a linked list of values and repetition counts). This helps in
three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It significantly reduces memory usage, since we only use
&#34;sizeof(ValuePtr) + value_len&#34; bytes for each value, rather than
&#34;sizeof(SafeCombinerKey) + sizeof(StringPiece) + value_len + new hash
table entry overhead&#34; for each value. This means that we flush the
reducer buffer less often.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It&#39;s significantly faster, since we avoid extra hash table entries when
we&#39;re inserting a new value for a key that already exists in the table
(and instead we just hook the value into the linked list of values for
that key).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since we associate a repetition count with each value in the linked
list, we can represent this sequence:</p>
<pre><code>Output(key, &#34;1&#34;);
Output(key, &#34;1&#34;);
Output(key, &#34;1&#34;);
Output(key, &#34;1&#34;);
Output(key, &#34;1&#34;);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>as a single entry in the linked list for &#34;key&#34; with a repetition count of 5.
Internally we yield &#34;1&#34; five times to the user-level combining function. (A
similar trick could be applied on the reduce side, perhaps).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(Minor) Added a test for &#34;nshards == 1&#34; to the default
MapReductionBase::KeyFingerprintSharding function that avoids fingerprinting
the key entirely if we are just using 1 reduce shard (since we can just
return 0 directly in that case without examining the key).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turned some VLOG(3) statements into DVLOG(3) in the code path that is called
for each key/value added to the combiner.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Reduces time for one wordcount benchmark from 12.56s to 6.55s.</p>

<summary><p>Rework the alarm handling code in the SelectServer to
significantly improve its performance (adding+removing an alarm from 771 ns to
271 ns).</p>
</summary>

<p>Reworked the alarm handling code in the SelectServer to significantly improve
its performance.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Switched to using <code>AdjustablePriorityQueue&lt;Alarm&gt;</code> instead of a a
<code>set&lt;Alarm*&gt;</code> for the <code>AlarmQueue</code>. This significantly speeds up alarm
handling, reducing the time taken to add and remove an alarm from 771
nanoseconds to 281 nanoseconds. This change avoids an
allocation/deallocation per alarm setup (for the red-black tree node in the
STL set object), and also gives much better cache locality (since the
AdjustablePriorityQueue is a heap implemented in a vector, rather than a
red-black tree), there are fewer cache lines touched when manipulating the
<code>AlarmQueue</code> on every trip through the selectserver loop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Converted AlarmList in Alarmer from a hash_map to a dense_hash_map to avoid
another allocation/deallocation per alarm addition/deletion (this also
improves cache locality when adding/removing alarms).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed the <code>num_alarms_stat_</code> and <code>num_closures_stat_</code>
MinuteTenMinuteHourStat objects, and the corresponding exported variables.
Although monitoring these seems nice, in practice they add significant
overhead to critical networking code. If I had left these variables in as
Atomic32 variables instead of MinuteTenMinuteHourStat, they would have still
increased the cost of adding and removing alarms from 281 nanoseconds to 340
nanoseconds.</p>

<summary><p>3.3X performance in index serving speed!</p>
</summary>

<p>We found a number of performance issues when planning a switch from on-disk to
in-memory index serving in 2001. This change fixed many of these problems and
took us from 150 to over 500 in-memory queries per second (for a 2 GB in-memory
index on dual processor Pentium III machine).</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of performance improvements to index block decoding speed (8.9 MB/s to
13.1 MB/s for a microbenchmark).</li>
<li>We now checksum the block during decoding. This allows us to implement all
of our getsymbol operations to be done without any bounds checking.</li>
<li>We have grungy macros that hold the various fields of a BitDecoder in local
variables over entire loops, and then store them back at the end of the
loops.</li>
<li>We use inline assembly to get at the &#39;bsf&#39; instruction on Intel chips for
getUnary (finds index of first 1 bit in a word)</li>
<li>When decoding values into a vector, we resize the vector outside of the loop
and just walk a pointer along the vector, rather than doing a bounds-checked
access to store every value.</li>
<li>During docid decoding, we keep the docids in local docid space, to avoid
multiplying by num_shards_. Only when we need the actual docid value do we
multiply by num_shards_ and add my_shard_.</li>
<li>The IndexBlockDecoder now exports an interface &#39;AdvanceToDocid&#39; that returns
the index of the first docid ≥ &#34;d&#34;. This permits the scanning to be done
in terms of local docids, rather than forcing the conversion of each local
docid to a global docid when the client calls GetDocid(index) for every
index in the block.</li>
<li>Decoding of position data for documents is now done on demand, rather than
being done eagerly for the entire block when the client asked for position
data for any document within the block.</li>
<li>If the index block being decoded ends within 4 bytes of a page boundary, we
copy it to a local buffer. This allows us to always load our bit decoding
buffer via a 4-byte load, without having to worry about seg faults if we run
off the end of a mmapped page.</li>
<li>We only initialize the first nterms_ elements of various scoring data
structures, rather than initializing all MAX_TERMS of them (in some cases,
we were unnecessarily memsetting 20K to 100K of data per document scored).</li>
<li>Avoid round_to_int and subsequent computation on intermediate scoring values
when the value being computed is 0 (the subsequent computation was just
writing &#39;0&#39; over the 0 that we had memset in these cases, and this was the
most common case).</li>
<li>Made a bounds check on scoring data structures into a debug-mode assertion.</li>
