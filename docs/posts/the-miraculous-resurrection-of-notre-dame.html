    <h1>The Miraculous Resurrection of Notre-Dame</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p><em>This story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors recommend one can’t-miss story every weekday. <a href="https://www.gq.com/newsletter/mustRead?newsletterId=249017&amp;sourcecode=articleCTA" target="_blank">Sign up here to get it in your inbox.</a></em></p><hr/><figure><div></div></figure><hr/><p><strong>Some time after</strong> six in the evening on April 15, 2019, Rémi Fromont was sitting at the Brasserie Saint-Malo, a lively café in Montparnasse, Paris, when his phone rang.</p><p>“Notre-Dame is on fire,” said a friend on the other end of the line.</p><p>Fromont, the chief architect of historic monuments at the French Ministry of Culture, assumed that the call was a joke. But when the caller insisted that he was dead serious, Fromont leapt out of his chair, got on his bike, and pedaled north toward the cathedral.</p><p>Fromont is a slim, elegant man of 46 with a cherubic face framed by tight brown curls. Born in Vincennes, outside Paris, he had spent his career renovating sites of national importance, and was intimately familiar with the medieval structure. Notre-Dame was a tinderbox, and if the fire couldn’t be controlled, he knew the result would be calamitous.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Fromont arrived at Notre-Dame de Paris, on the Île de la Cité. Wisps of smoke were rising from the cathedral’s lead roof covering. An ominous glow was beginning to envelop the Flèche, the over 300-foot-tall spire added by the French architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc in 1859. But beneath the spire lay a greater risk: the cathedral’s medieval roof frame, a roughly 300-foot-long, 30-foot-high assemblage of medieval axe-hewn oak beams so dense and intricate that it had been nicknamed <em>la forêt</em>—the forest.</p><p>A colleague who had arrived a few minutes earlier approached Fromont. He, too, knew about ancient wood’s combustibility.</p><p>“The forest,” the colleague said, “is dead.”</p><p>Hundreds of firefighters were already trying to control the blaze. One expressed to Fromont his fear that the vaults, the limestone arches that formed the ceiling of the grand interior, might collapse. If that were to happen, the entire cathedral could come down. Fromont knew that Gothic cathedrals across France had withstood intense bombings during the two World Wars. “Everything [inside] was destroyed, but the high walls were still there,” Fromont explained. Then he shared his own concern: the two bells in the south tower on the western façade. If the fire spread there, the bronze bells inside—which weighed about 30,000 pounds—could crash to the ground, possibly damaging the walls and endangering the firefighters inside the church.</p><p>About an hour after his arrival, Fromont, with thousands of Parisians at the scene and millions watching around the world, looked on as the 750-ton spire, made of 1,230 oak beams, blazed, teetered, snapped like a matchstick, and crashed through the roof. Spectators broke into tears of disbelief and horror.</p><p>Soon, the forest succumbed to the fire. Flames raced through the lattice, turning the 800-year-old oak beams to ash. Joists and rafters crackled, combusted, broke apart, and tumbled onto the vaults, although, mercifully, most proved strong enough to withstand the weight of the falling wood.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Within a few hours, said Fromont: “There was nothing left.”</p><p>Fromont remained at the scene until 2 a.m., distraught, still not quite believing what he’d witnessed. For many the cathedral was the very soul of France, eternally bound up in the country’s identity. Victor Hugo had used it for the setting of <em>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame</em>. Napoleon Bonaparte rescued it from potential destruction during the French Revolution, and had himself crowned emperor there in 1804. Charles de Gaulle held a service in the cathedral after the liberation of Paris in 1944. By 2019, Notre-Dame drew more than 10 million visitors a year, making it one of the most popular tourist attractions in the world. Now it was a charred ruin.</p><figure><p><span>Philippe Wang/Getty Images</span></p></figure><hr/><p><strong>The day after</strong> the fire, French president Emmanuel Macron made a promise: Notre-Dame would rise again in the next five years. Rival French luxury-goods billionaires François-Henri Pinault and Bernard Arnault pledged a total of $339 million for the reconstruction; according to <em>The New York Times</em>, more than $950 million was promised or donated in the days following the fire. A new government agency was created to oversee the project, Rebâtir Notre-Dame de Paris (Rebuild Notre-Dame de Paris), and Macron appointed Jean-Louis Georgelin, a former chief of staff for France’s armed forces and a chancellor of the Légion d’Honneur, to lead it. Philippe Villeneuve, the 61-year-old chief architect of France’s national monuments, would supervise the restoration. Fromont would join the team.</p><p>With the blaze extinguished, church officials, engineers, and architectural experts surveyed the damage. Conceived in 1160 by Maurice de Sully, then bishop of Paris, Notre-Dame had taken nearly two centuries to complete. It exemplified a then revolutionary new Gothic architectural style characterized by soaring vaults, ornamental ceilings that joined together several arches; stained glass windows; flying buttresses; and a light-filled nave (the central part of a church, where the congregation sits) and choir (which provides seating for the clergy and faced east, toward Jerusalem). Although the fire’s origin is still under investigation, in the days after the incident, investigators suspected that the fire had started in the Flèche, probably resulting from an electrical short circuit. When the spire collapsed, it destroyed a part of the nave’s vault, tearing a gaping hole in the roof. Later that night, the north arm of the transept’s vault also collapsed. But none of the many priceless paintings, sculptures, and windows that filled the church’s interior—though they were stained by smoke and singed by fire—had been wrecked beyond repair.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The roof frame was a different story. Known in French as the <em>charpente,</em> it was an ingenious assemblage of triangular-shaped trusses, each one consisting of horizontal and vertical beams and diagonal rafters designed to support the heavy roof cover and distribute the weight over the walls beneath it. Built from thousands of pieces of wood and assembled without nails, it was a singular achievement, one of the oldest surviving all-wood structures in the world. And now it, along with Viollet-le-Duc’s Flèche, was gone.</p><p>Instantly, debates broke out about how to rebuild the sacred space. Fromont likened the emotionally charged arguments to those that had surrounded Ground Zero after 9/11. Nobody had died in the fire, but for the French, obsessed with cultural heritage and tradition, the question took on similar urgency. “One idea was to leave it completely empty, untouched,” Fromont told me. “But that didn’t make sense. Notre-Dame is a living church and it had to be rebuilt.” Others argued that the destroyed sections should be reconstructed using modern, fire-resistant materials. During World War I, German artillery shells had reduced the cathedral in Reims, another Gothic masterpiece, to charred wood and rubble. In 1919, the architect Henri Deneux launched the restoration, reconstructing the church’s roof with reinforced concrete, a decision that was controversial at the time.</p><p>Fromont had not warmed to Deneux’s approach. He believed that the roof’s charpente could be rebuilt exactly as the medieval carpenters had done it. The approach was not without risks—Fromont had told me, “Wood burns. I’m not going to say the opposite”—but certain measures could be put into place to mitigate its vulnerability. In fact, the architect had a particular gift that might be the key to the cathedral’s resurrection.</p><figure><p><span>Patrick Zachmann/Magnum Photos</span></p></figure><hr/><p><strong>Notre-Dame’s medieval</strong> artisans—the blacksmiths who forged the axes, hewers who squared the timber, joiners who connected the timbers without nails or screws—represented a <em>savoir-faire,</em> or expertise, that has all but died out in the age of Ikea. Masons cut limestone from quarries near Paris and transported blocks by horse cart to the capital. Foresters searched dense woodlands for the straightest and sturdiest oak trees and felled them with steel-tipped axes. They used ropes and scaffolding made of branches to hoist the timber and stone.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The roof’s charpente was perhaps their greatest creation. Yet Fromont told me that, until recently, it had never been the subject of serious scholarly study. Hidden from view and difficult to access, it appears to have been largely overlooked by academics, who preferred to focus on Notre-Dame’s gargoyles, limestone arches, flying buttresses, and other more tangible glories. There were 19th-century sketches of the charpente, Fromont explained, including from Viollet-le-Duc, but they were “incoherent” and “did not represent reality.” A century and a half later, dendrochronologists—scientists who study tree rings—analyzed some of the medieval timbers.</p><p>In 2012, Fromont, then a 35-year-old scholar at Paris’s École de Chaillot, decided to address that absence. For his advanced degree, Fromont proposed spending a year surveying every inch of the charpente. When they were at last granted permission, he and his partner on the project, Cédric Trentesaux, entered the cathedral’s south transept and climbed a winding staircase into the triangular south gable. There they squeezed through an aperture and entered a medieval realm barely visited in over 800 years.</p><figure><p><span>Patrick Zachmann/Magnum Photos</span></p></figure><p>Instantly, they were enveloped in darkness. The musty aroma of ancient oak hung in the air. Fromont breathed it in, reveling in the thrill of discovery. A symmetrical row of oak triangles, each fortified by a dozen or more vertical, horizontal, and diagonal beams and struts, comprised the frame above the nave; an equal number formed the frame above the choir. Above the apse, the curved recess at the church’s eastern end, bent oak beams came together to resemble a kind of tepee. Together, the engineering reflected the work, wrote one French researcher, of “one of the boldest and most important master carpenters of his time.”</p><p>For the next year, Fromont and Trentesaux climbed into the forest once a week. From morning until evening, shivering in winter and sweltering during the summer, they worked with methodical attention to every detail. They snapped pictures, and took laser measurements, recording signs of repairs and modifications made after the original construction. They noted the subtle variations of each piece of wood, and traces of the axe blades that the hewers had used, centuries ago, to square the beams. The carpenters, Fromont noticed, had chiseled initials and Roman numerals onto each truss, providing a chronological record of the forest’s astonishing construction.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The two men emerged from the project with the most extensive blueprint of the 800-year-old structure that had ever been created. “It wasn’t a lot, but it was enough,” Fromont said, showing me some of those drawings, mounted by magnetic pins to his office walls. They would, a decade later, serve as the road map for Notre-Dame’s rebirth.</p><hr/><p><strong>Months after the</strong> fire, the odor of smoke hung over the ruins. Safety teams prowled the site, measuring lead-contamination levels and carefully removing damaged sculptures and paintings. Fromont had other matters to concentrate on. There was some skepticism that the charpente could be re-created in its original glory, but Fromont found an ally in François Calame, France’s leading apostle of traditional carpentry. In the early 1990s, as a young carpenter, Calame had visited Maramures‚ a remote region in western Romania. Isolated from a fast-changing world during Nicolae Ceausescu’s 24-year dictatorship, artisans there had kept the old ways of carpentry alive.</p><p>Like in Romania, traditional French axmen used hand tools: the <em>hache de grossière</em>, a long-handled, narrow-bladed axe used to remove large amounts of wood, and the <em>doloire</em>, a broad-bladed, short-handled axe designed for precision chipping following the grain of the wood. It’s slow and physical work: Squaring lumber by hand can take much more time than doing it with buzz saws. For that reason, by the 20th century, axes had all but disappeared as a construction tool. Yet their proponents extol the end result: more pliable, stronger beams, and imperfections that reflect the extensive labor and love of craft. “This is a kind of magical work because you feel the material,” Fromont told me. “You smell it and touch it.”</p><p>Calame became one of the world’s connoisseurs of the <em>doloire,</em> a tool that conjures images of Crusaders and medieval serfs. Traveling across Eastern Europe in search of the perfect axe, Calame would delight in the differences in the shape of the cutting edge, the kind of steel, the curve of the handle. In 1992, he formed Carpenters Without Borders (Charpentiers Sans Frontières)<em>,</em> an association of master craftsmen that travel to construction sites around the world. They used newly felled trees and axes to build forges and octagonal wells in Romania; a house in China; a blacksmith shop in rural Maine.</p><figure><p><span>Patrick Zachmann/Magnum Photos</span></p></figure></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The Romanian artisans, Calame noted, worked exclusively with fresh-cut lumber. Modern builders tend to frown on using “green wood” because the material can bend and warp, losing its mass as its moisture evaporates. They prefer to let cut wood dry before putting it in a frame. Traditionalists argue that green wood’s flexibility makes it far more responsive to hand tools and can result in a sturdier product. Fromont had seen telltale marks within the wood grain of the charpente indicating that Notre-Dame’s medieval carpenters had used green wood; that structure, of course, had endured for nearly a millennium. Now, the movement that Calame helped inspire would play a crucial role in bringing the world’s most famous cathedral back from near death.</p><p>In 2020, on the lawn of an 18-century castle near the Normandy coast, Carpenters Without Borders put on a demonstration for Notre-Dame’s decision-makers. Twenty-five volunteer carpenters built a replica of the nave’s <em>ferme</em> number seven, the most technically challenging truss. Once they had joined the timbers, the carpenters slowly hoisted the truss off the ground so the grandees could imagine how it would look in the church. “They showed that you can do the work by hand and it won’t be much more expensive or slower,” Fromont told me. (In a slight concession to modernity, they used buzz saws to square two of each log’s four sides.)</p><p>For Philippe Jost, an engineer who was then serving as General Georgelin’s deputy director, the display confirmed for him Fromont’s instincts about how to proceed. “We think it best that the cathedral remain the same,” Jost told me. “Truth comes through the genuine materials—the oak, the stone….[and] respect for the monument as we knew it.”</p><p>It wasn’t only the roof’s charpente that would be rebuilt according to original methods. All 460 tons of the original lead had melted in the fire, and toxic particles had settled across Paris, contaminating parks, streets, and buildings. Yet—as the medieval masters understood—lead is flexible, long-lasting, and capable of withstanding intense gusts of wind. These days, the use of lead is regulated in France, but permission was granted for the original spire’s material to be used in the restoration. A replica of Viollet-le-Duc’s varnished oak-framed spire, coated with a lead skin, would rise above the church as well.</p><hr/><p><strong>Just as Fromont</strong> was gathering support for his charpente, COVID threatened to unravel President Macron’s five-year plan. In spring 2020, the pandemic temporarily forced all work inside the cathedral to a halt. But safety protocols were put in place, and about 1,000 artisans—including sculptors of stone, painting restorers, metalworkers, glassmakers, organ repairers, and woodworkers—joined the effort. They would clean or repair some 40 stained glass windows, the 8,000-pipe great organ, 23 paintings, almost a thousand feet of metalwork, and 54 grotesques, including some of the famous gargoyles. The collapsed vaults had to be rebuilt. Four ateliers that specialized in heritage-building renovation—Les Bras Frères, Asselin, Cruard Charpente, and MdB Métiers du Bois—were awarded the contract to re-create the spire.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Loïc Desmonts had ambitions to resurrect the forest. Desmonts and his father, Rémy, run a small atelier in the Normandy village of Nassandres-sur-Risle, surrounded by wheat, sugar beet, and flax fields. In 2011, the elder Desmonts had encountered a team from Carpenters Without Borders that was renovating a medieval barn in the countryside. Loïc, then 12, remembers his father telling him to come observe the scene. “I could smell the fresh wood, the choke of the blacksmith shop,” Loïc told me. “It was crazy to see these people, 40 carpenters from all around the world, speaking different languages.”</p><p>Over the next decade, Ateliers Desmonts became a leader of the small but growing movement in France that Calame had helped inspire. Modern building construction, with its reliance on power saws, symmetrically machined timbers, and rafters fixed with glue or metal plates, the traditionalists argued, has taken the heart and soul out of woodworking. “You put some screws into some precut wood. You don’t know where the trees come from,” the 25-year-old Loïc told me, as we toured his barnlike workshop. Solidly built, with a mop of tousled brown hair and a beard and mustache, he has the animated manner of a man who has fully embraced his calling. The old way, he explained, meant going into the forest and finding trees that match the length and diameter of the beam one needed, and hand-hewing the lumber in the workshop. When Rebâtir Notre-Dame announced it was accepting proposals to rebuild the forest, the Desmonts thought their chances of winning the contract were slim. Theirs was a small family enterprise. How could it compete with industry giants? “We couldn’t imagine it would happen,” Loïc told me. But with Rebâtir Notre-Dame pursuing a traditional approach, they began to think that their savoir-faire made them a perfect candidate for the job. “We said, ‘We are the only ones that can do it. We know all the people. We have dreamed about it, and I think they are waiting for us.’ ” One of those industry giants was Ateliers Perrault. Founded in 1760, the atelier, based in Saint Laurent de la Plaine, in Anjou, had 170 employees, and a history of grand heritage projects. The Desmonts believed that the two companies could form a winning partnership, and they reached out to Jean-Louis Bidet, Ateliers Perrault’s technical director. “We met and said we were going to work together,” Bidet told me. “We know how to design and carve these large charpentes, and they knew how to cut wood with an axe.”</p><p>In July 2022, the agency announced the winning bids: Ateliers Perrault and Ateliers Desmonts. Loïc was exhilarated. For over a decade his tiny workshop had labored in relative anonymity. It was now about to undertake the most publicized and closely watched renovation project in the world.</p><hr/><p><strong>That August,</strong> they started identifying potential trees. Much has changed in forestry since medieval times. The harvesting of lumber used to be done with axes, but now chainsaws do most of the work. Some lumberjacks of old held that trees should be sawed only at certain times of year, such as winter, when the sap level was supposedly lower and the lumber was lighter. But now <em>abattage,</em> or tree felling, takes place relentlessly, regardless of season.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>Loïc’s girlfriend, Lou Karoui, an agricultural engineer, traveled to forest reserves across Normandy and the Loire Valley to locate suitable timber. Sawyers chopped down 1,200 oaks—most of them 80 to 150 years old and some 60 feet tall—including rare, irregularly shaped trees needed for the nave and choir. “We had to find the perfect wood with the perfect curve, similar to those of the original frame,” Bidet explained.</p><p>The two ateliers divided construction, with Ateliers Perrault taking care of the choir, and Ateliers Desmonts handling the nave. “Jean-Louis and I had some real hard conversations,” Loïc told me over a lunch of bifteck and pommes frites in Harcourt, a village down the road from his atelier. “They were conventional, and we were traditional,” Loïc said. In the beginning, Loïc explained that Ateliers Perrault approached cutting like other modern companies, “sawing straight timbers with big machines.” According to Loïc, they also followed the modern practice of sawing away the sapwood to get to the harder heartwood beneath it. In his view, they were “milling a crazy amount, and wasting a lot of wood.” Loïc left intact as much of the sapwood—the younger, softer, outer portion of a tree—as possible. Both ateliers, Loïc explained, adopted a mixed method. The well-connected Loïc took on the immense job of assembling both the necessary materials and the small army of artisans he knew they’d need.</p><figure><p><span>Patrick Zachmann/Magnum Photos</span></p></figure><p>In late 2022, Loïc sent out a flurry of emails and WhatsApp messages to people he had met through Carpenters Without Borders. Fifty-five craftsmen and five craftswomen—from France, the US, Argentina, Spain, Italy, England, and Lithuania—answered the call. Loïc explained that 30 went to Ateliers Perrault; 30 came to Nassandres-sur-Risle. Among them was Hank Silver, a rabbi’s son who owned a small carpentry firm in western Massachusetts. He had befriended Loïc on a Carpenters Without Borders project a few years earlier and came to Normandy in 2023 because he was captivated, he says, by the idea of “keeping the traditional techniques and savoir-faire alive.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>The ateliers provided the artisans with food, and found them places to stay. Loïc ordered 60 axes from a blacksmith he knew near Strasbourg; each needed to be handcrafted to fit the needs of the individual. Handles had to be ergonomically curved for left- or right-handers, so the user wouldn’t knock their hands against the lumber with each stroke. The blades were forged using two kinds of iron: a very hard one on the edge, and the other smoother, which reduced the vibrations that could lead to repetitive stress injury. To hew the lumber needed—the equivalent of about 12 miles of logs laid end to end—the ateliers made concessions to modern times. By running two of the log faces through a sawmill, labor time could be reduced. Though it might not have been what the medieval guys did, Loïc said, it allowed the two ateliers to respect the grain, preserve the energy of the crew, and probably also ended up cutting down on costs. “The hewing is physically demanding,” he explained. “You have to have a state of mind that is really strong.” By June 2023, the 60 trusses of the nave were laid out in enormous tents on the atelier grounds. That month, General Georgelin, accompanied by Rebâtir Notre-Dame officials, architects, and members of the press, came to see the progress. Flushed with pride, Loïc warmly greeted the general, and he and the artisans from Ateliers Desmonts demonstrated the doloire, then let him hew a log. “We showed him how it was done in the Middle Ages,” Loïc remembered. As Georgelin looked on, carpenters raised one of the approximately 7-ton trusses with ropes and braced it just as it would look inside the cathedral. “Vive la charpente,” Loïc recalled the general saying. “Vive Notre-Dame. Et vive la famille Desmonts.”</p><p>But Georgelin, as it happened, would never see Notre-Dame revived. Soon after, the general took a short break from the job to embark on a solo hike in the Pyrenees. In August 2023, his body was found at the bottom of a mountain near the Spanish border; he is believed to have fallen to his death. Loïc, stunned, recalled his firm handshake, his jocular manner, and his easy air of authority. Now there was a hole at the center of the project. “It was a big shock,” Philippe Jost, who assumed command after the general’s death, told me. “But we asked ourselves what would the general want? He would want us to go on and succeed.”</p><hr/><p><strong>By the end</strong> of the summer of 2023, the trusses were ready. Carpenters disassembled each ferme and loaded the thousands of pieces that made up the trusses onto trucks to the Île de la Cité. One by one, workers put the trusses back together at the base of Notre-Dame. Then cranes, straining against the wind, eased them carefully into position.</p><p>Other parts of the renovation were proceeding quickly. In December, a crane delicately placed a new golden rooster—the national emblem of France and a symbol of Christianity—on top of the just completed spire. The rooster, a variation of the original that adorned the Flèche, sprouts flamelike wings, meant to conjure up a phoenix rising from the ashes. Villeneuve, who designed the new ornament, called it “a fire of resurrection.”</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><p>On January 12, 2024, the choir’s charpente was completed. Then the project’s youngest carpenter, 19-year-old Léonard from Ateliers Perrault, laid a bouquet of yellow mimosas on top. A few months later, on March 8, it was time for the team that had built the nave’s charpente to celebrate. Observing the scene with a mix of euphoria and melancholy, Loïc launched into a speech in front of the carpenters and members of Rebâtir Notre-Dame, but after two minutes he had to stop, overcome by emotion.</p><hr/><p><strong>One clear afternoon</strong> this June, Frédérique Meyer, Rebâtir Notre-Dame’s deputy of press relations, met me at the agency’s makeshift base camp, just beyond the eastern end of the cathedral. I put on rubber boots, a protective suit, and a helmet, and went to join Meyer at the vast construction site.</p><p>Scaffolding covered the cathedral, but Meyer expressed confidence that Notre-Dame would open on schedule on December 8—less than six months away. A rickety elevator took us up 120 feet to the roof. We stepped onto a platform where a few workers were taking a break under a blazing sun. They were in the final stages of laying new lead panels atop the charpente, a painstaking procedure that had begun two months earlier. Craftspeople had first molded the heavy tiles in a workshop outside Paris; the roofers had then laid down dry oak planks, called <em>voliges</em>, over the roof frame, and topped that with a layer of waterproof paper. At last, the tiles were meticulously fastened down with wood strips known as battens.</p><p>Paris spread before us. The Seine and its riverside promenades presented a scene not too different, I thought, from that which must have confronted the 12th-century carpenters on their scaffolding of branches. The ancient square below was filled with a temporary exhibit showing black-and-white portraits of sculptors, masons, and other artisans, and tourists perched on bleachers to watch the reconstruction. Beyond rose the modern-day city: the sleek skyscrapers of La Défense, the Fondation Louis Vuitton, the Eiffel Tower.</p><p>After chatting with the workmen, Meyer escorted me inside. I had expected to see the entire roof frame in all its glory. Instead, I found myself wandering through what looked like a low-ceilinged attic, an obstacle course of posts and crossbeams. Several tiers of temporary work platforms divided the choir charpente, allowing me to glimpse only a sliver of the masterpiece. Workers were installing a fire suppression system in the Flèche and in all the charpentes, which would release jets of mist in the event of another fire. Two firewalls were installed at the base of the spire. Jean-Louis Bidet, who had driven up that morning, pointed through a hole in the floor to the vaults a few feet below us, where much of the ceiling had remained intact.</p><p>We were joined by Hank Silver, the Massachusetts carpenter, who had spent about eight months in Normandy building the charpente alongside the other artisans. Most of the foreigners had gone home, but Silver—bearded, bespectacled, in his early 40s—had fallen in love with France and had decided to stay. His French was now fluent, and he was looking for a full-time job. In the meantime, he was working on finishing the roof.</p></div></div></div></div><div><div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><div><figure><p><span>Patrick Zachmann/Magnum Photos</span></p></figure><p>We walked west toward the nave and emerged at the bottom of the spire. Men in harnesses were traversing the oak frame like mountaineers, making sure that each of the 2,000 <em>assemblages</em>—joints—were holding fast.</p><p>Inside, Silver showed me marks on the wood left by the axes. Instead of the smoothness of timber squared in sawmills, the beams had a rough, undulating quality. Each imperfection reflected the vagaries of the grain, the shape of the axe, and the hewing style. “These axe-hewn frames are more beautiful, more interesting, and deeper, because the human work leaves its traces,” Jost, by then project manager of Rebâtir Notre-Dame, told me later that afternoon in a conference room overlooking the apse. The reconstructed charpente, he said, reflected both the savoir-faire and the dedication of the hundreds of artisans who had built it. “It has a soul,” he said.</p><p>Like many others at Notre-Dame, Hank Silver felt that he had given the project his soul. Now he was determined to see it through to the end. Until recently, Silver hadn’t even known what a “nave” was. But he had become deeply versed in the cathedral’s history. The original 12th-century construction had taken so long, he told me, that three generations had carved their marks onto the frame. Silver gestured to a rafter on the north side of the church, where a modern-day craftsman had etched his personal signature: a half-moon. “A lot of us have put our own markings here,” he told me.</p><p>Bidet, standing beside us, looked on with mixed emotions. The masterpiece that he and his colleagues had constructed was about to be covered up and concealed from the world, he acknowledged, but for “us, the carpenters, it’s often like that. We build things that are hidden.” The roof was nearly finished; the grand opening, in December, was approaching. Then, like the work of their medieval predecessors, their achievement would be sealed back into the darkness—perhaps to remain for another 850 years.</p><p><strong>Joshua Hammer</strong> <em>is a frequent</em> GQ <em>contributor.</em></p><p><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the October 2024 issue of GQ with the title “The Miraculous Resurrection of Notre-Dame”</em></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
