<p>In a major clean energy benchmark, wind, solar, and hydro exceeded 100% of demand on California’s main grid for 30 of the past 38 days.</p>



<p>Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering Mark Z. Jacobson has been tracking California’s renewables performance, and he shares his findings on Twitter (X) when the state breaks records. Yesterday he posted:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is not an anomaly.</p>— Mark Z. Jacobson (@mzjacobson) <a href="https://twitter.com/mzjacobson/status/1779614175075197142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Jacobson notes that supply exceeds demand for “0.25-6 h per day,” and that’s an important fact. The continuity lies not in renewables running the grid for the entire day but in the fact that it’s happening on a consistent daily basis, which has never been achieved before.</p>



<p>At the two-week record mark, Ian Magruder at Rewiring America made this great point <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ianmagruder_this-is-getting-so-easy-its-almost-boring-activity-7176053666829762561-3UgW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">on LinkedIn</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>And what makes it even better is that California has the largest grid-connected battery storage facility in the world (<a href="https://electrek.co/2024/01/25/us-largest-solar-battery-storage-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came online in January</a> …), meaning those batteries were filling up with excess energy from the sun all afternoon today and are now deploying as we speak to offset a good chunk of the methane gas generation that California still uses overnight.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On April 2, the California Independent System Operator (ISO) recommended 26 new transmission projects worth $6.1 billion, with a big number being devoted to offshore wind.</p>




	<p>In response, Jacobson predicted <a href="https://twitter.com/mzjacobson/status/1775902563310899254">on April 4</a> that California will entirely be on renewables and battery storage 24/7 by 2035. </p>



<p>California passed a law that commits to achieving 100% net zero electricity by 2045. Will it beat that goal by a decade? We hope so. It’s going to be exciting to watch.</p>
