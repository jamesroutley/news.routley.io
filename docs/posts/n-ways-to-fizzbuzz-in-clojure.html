    <h1>n ways to FizzBuzz in Clojure</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>FizzBuzz is everywhere. Every programmer passes through its rite of passage,
or at least bears witness to another. Over the years, many gentlenerds have
taken it upon themselves to discover ever new ways to incant those hoary symbols.</p>
<p>I hereby enjoin these few drops of Clojure to that roiling ocean of FizzBuzzery.</p>
<p>The brainwave here is to (mis)use the feature set of Clojure and its standard
library to cook up as many ways to encode FizzBuzz as one can muster (or steal).
If all goes well, this post will receive many updates. If it goes <em>really</em>
well, all sorts of bad ideas and clever foot-guns will be discovered and used.</p>
<p>The creative constraint is this: any FizzBuzz, however terrible or hilarious,
<em>must also be useful</em>. It should have reason to exist and should reveal some
real-world Clojure thinking.</p>
<p>That means no <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition">FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition</a>
but also no Dylan Beattie’s brilliant <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U&amp;t=3350s">FizzBuzz in RockStar</a>.
So sorry!</p>
<p>Not to be indelicate, but I will state the problem before proceeding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by
three with the word “fizz”, and any number divisible by five with the word “buzz”.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz%5Fbuzz">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz%5Fbuzz</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, they mean natural numbers starting at 1 when they say “numbers”.</p>
<p>Phew that was rough on the ego. Let us compose ourselves for a minute.</p>

<p>Sadly, the spurious nils are the least of your woes. You just fell prey to
something called “Laziness”, and the code is dead on arrival, but you don’t
know it yet because evaluating <em>in</em> the “REPL” obscures this fact.</p>
<p>Welcome to Functional Programming (FP) with lazy sequences, which is <em>awesome</em>,
but which is also one of the double edges of Clojure that will cut you if you
come here with set ideas about How Things Ought To Work.</p>
<p>Saying it in French (however broken) felt gentler, somehow.</p>
<p>At this point, you might accuse me of setting you up with this strawman <code>for</code>.
In response, I might simply wait for your production to blow up. Unknowing
mixing of laziness and side effects reliably trips up all programmers new to
Clojure <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Luckily we can avoid going down that rabbit hole <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> entirely, because
there is a more pressing problem that makes <em>Le FizzBuzz Classique</em> look
severely defective to this Clojurist’s FP-addled brain. Fixing that makes the
point of lazy sequences moot, as a nice bonus.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Well, that’s because all expressions in Clojure return a value. <code>println</code>
creates a side effect of printing and has a return value of <code>nil</code>. Thus for
each item in the input range, the “impure” classic version prints to the REPL,
collects the return value of each println (nil), and returns that collection.</p>
<p>The “purified” fizz-buzz simply calculates a result for each branch and the
<code>for</code> returns the accumulated result. And now the results are printed inside
parentheses, which is, like, sure whatever. At least it <em>looks</em> like it’s
doing the right calculations <em>and</em> the pesky nils are gone, so we can move on?</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<h3 id="le-fizzbuzz-classique-dissected">Le FizzBuzz Classique, dissected<a href="#le-fizzbuzz-classique-dissected" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>To FizzBuzz creatively in Clojure, we must examine <em>and avoid</em> the defects of
the classic version, which are as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Broken behaviour</strong>: <code>println</code> alters the state of the world and thus
injects non-determinism into an otherwise purely functional calculation.
This is anathema <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> to Clojurists (and FP practitioners at large).</li>
<li><strong>Broken API contract</strong>: We get back a useless collection nils, instead of the
result of a calculation that we can use further. We prefer to always write
functions that return useful values.</li>
<li><strong>Broken time model</strong>: Effects want to happen “now” (here, printing to
some output device), while lazy computations want to happen “maybe never”
(here, a definition that maps the domain of a collection of countless
numbers to the domain of FizzBuzz). Effects and laziness can be made to
pair well, <em>but only when</em> we define them separately from the get go, and
have some third way of joining them together safely when needed. For now,
you could do worse than lasering this into your brain: “Never mix (side)
effects and laziness.”.</li>
<li><strong>Broken aesthetic</strong>: We like our functions to do one job, and do it well.
Printing things is a <em>second</em> job, and as Messers Hal and Gerry like to
say in SICP <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, “That’s George’s problem.”.</li>
</ol>
<p>Henceforth, all functions shall be pure calculations, and we will rely on
our metaphorical George “the REPL” Ableman to handle all our print jobs.</p>
<p>As an added benefit, writing pure functions makes laziness such a good friend,
that we don’t even need to acknowledge its presence.</p>
<p>Yet another benefit is that we won’t have to burn hundreds of words to apologise
for broken code <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>See? Such passion. I wasn’t joking when I said “looks severely defective to me” <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<h3 id="le-fizzbuzz-classique-doseq-d">Le FizzBuzz Classique, doseq’d<a href="#le-fizzbuzz-classique-doseq-d" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Maybe you still aren’t convinced. <code>println</code> is such a global standard. <em>Easy</em> <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.
So you might dig into the standard library more and come up with <code>doseq</code> to
eliminate laziness…</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>doseq-fizz-buzz
  [num-xs]
  (doseq [n num-xs]
    (<span>cond</span>
      (zero? (rem n <span>15</span>)) (println <span>&#34;FizzBuzz&#34;</span>)
      (zero? (rem n <span>3</span>)) (println <span>&#34;Fizz&#34;</span>)
      (zero? (rem n <span>5</span>)) (println <span>&#34;Buzz&#34;</span>)
      <span>:else</span> (println n))))
</code></pre></div><p>And declare victory…</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure">user=&gt; (<span>doseq-fizz-buzz</span> (list <span>1</span> <span>3</span> <span>5</span> <span>15</span> <span>19</span>))
<span>1</span>
Fizz
Buzz
FizzBuzz
<span>19</span>
nil <span>; maybe we can live with just one nil?</span>
</code></pre></div><p>But the code is still fatally broken for the other reasons, and now <em>it is
also worse</em>, because this implementation cannot say “here are <em>all</em> the
fizzbuzzes”. Only a lazy definition can say this <em>and</em> allow you to carry on
computing. Besides, <code>doseq</code> is meant for cases when we <em>want to cause</em> side
effects. And the functional Clojurist almost never <em>wants</em> to.</p>
<p>Remember the children’s game definition of FizzBuzz? It is beautiful because
it <em>does not</em> say “FizzBuzz only for the first K numbers”. Now if you go
DuckDuck search the standard coding interview version of the question, what
do you find? “Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100
such that…”.</p>
<p>Boo.</p>

<p>As a famous TV detective would say; “Oh, just one other thing.”. Here are ways
to break your programs. And if you are feeling suitably adventurous, to also
test the stability of your employment.</p>
<p>The following invocation of <code>lazybuzz</code> in your <code>-main</code> would not be fine,
assuming you wanted to do something useful with it. But would also not
precipitate anything terrible.</p>

Take that, cryptominers!</p>
<p>To be fair, you can also break programs with lazy evaluation, with the added
benefit of doing it silently. But at least you are forced to say <code>doall</code>,

<p>Once we remove the <em>ick</em> of <code>println</code> from our code, we can see further room
for improvement. <code>(zero? (rem n divisor))</code> is not only a common pattern,
it is actually a distinct <em>idea</em>, viz. “Is <code>n</code> <em>divisible</em> by <code>divisor</code>?”.</p>
<p>We can name it locally, with <code>let</code>.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>letbuzz

</code></pre></div><p><em>However</em>, this definition of divisibility is generally applicable to numbers,
so it makes sense to define a top-level global concept.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>def </span>divisible?
  <span>&#34;True when the remainder of n1/n2 is zero. e.g. (divisible? 4 2) =&gt; true&#34;</span>
  (<span>fn </span>[n1 n2] (zero? (rem n1 n2))))
</code></pre></div><p>Yep, <code>defn</code> is just <code>def</code> + <code>fn</code> under the hood, and we can conveniently
write the same thing as follows.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>divisible?
  <span>&#34;True when the remainder of n1/n2 is zero. e.g. (divisible? 4 2) =&gt; true&#34;</span>
  [n1 n2]
  (zero? (rem n1 n2)))
</code></pre></div><p>We can also use <code>comp</code> to define divisibility more succinctly.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>def </span>divisible?
  <span>&#34;True when the remainder of n1/n2 is zero. e.g. (divisible? 4 2) =&gt; true&#34;</span>
  (comp zero? rem))
</code></pre></div><p>Since the various implementations of <code>divisible?</code> are all pure functions,
they are drop-in replacements for each other (“referentially transparent”).
Use whichever version you like best.</p>
<p>It may seem silly to write such tiny functions, but we earn a lot of firepower
by lifting out named domain concepts, <em>especially</em> the simple ones, because
we can <em>compose</em> them flexibly to express other domain concepts as needed.</p>

deeply intertwined <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> two very distinct computations; viz. sequence

argument is placed first, and successively more variable argument(s) are
placed successively. Also rely on “truthiness” in Clojure to imply yes/no.</p>

<p>You might protest that well actually the clever little functions, in fact,
express the domain of the <em>solution</em> (the business of calculating FizzBuzz),
not the domain of the <em>problem</em> (arithmetic representation of FizzBuzz).</p>
<p>And even though I flunked maths a lot, I would concur. So here goes nothing…</p>
<p>15 is the least common multiple of the prime factors. Suppose we cook up an
encoding scheme based on remainders of 15, and write it down as a lookup table?
We can then find <code>(rem n 15)</code>, and look up the answer to FizzBuzz in the table.</p>

to pry apart two things masquerading as one (<em>“decomplecting”</em> <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup>
in Clojurish). But, <em>what exactly</em> are we, ah, <em>decomplecting</em>? Now that is
a very interesting rabbit hole.</p>
<p>In this case we are <em>“separating mechanism from policy”</em> <sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup>.
Figuring out how to do this delivers a powerful, flexible method of program
design into our eager hands.</p>

<p><em><strong>Mechanism</strong></em></p>
<p>The <em><strong>“mechanism”</strong></em> here is <em>any</em> function that translates a number (or more
generally, <em>any</em> thing) to the two inputs of a 2-value truth table. We can
see it more clearly if we rewrite the input columns of the truth table like
this. Here <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> are functions of <code>a</code> to Boolean.</p>

<p><em><strong>Policy</strong></em></p>
<p>Here, we define <em><strong>“policy”</strong></em> as something having special context of FizzBuzz
that consumes input rows of the truth table and emits corresponding output fields.</p>
<p>First, we specialise the abstract <code>mechanism</code> to a FizzBuzz mechanism. You

because the trivial replacement of <code>map</code> with <code>pmap</code> teaches a lesson.</p>
<p>Parallelism is impossibly hard if we don’t have pure functions, immutability,
and laziness. When we do, it reduces to merely hard but tractable. The
proverbial single character code modification (in this case, literally so)
gets a free ride on those other constructs.</p>
<p>We can see it in <code>pmap</code>’s implementation. It is fairly straightforward. Fetch
its source and stare at it for a bit; <code>(clojure.repl/source pmap)</code>. You will
be able to make sense of it with a bit of cross-referencing ClojureDocs.</p>
<p>If your favourite language has something similar (parallel version of a
sequential function), and if you choose to compare implementations, I will
be delighted to learn from your analysis!</p>

<h2 id="non-destructive-fizzbuzz">Non-Destructive FizzBuzz<a href="#non-destructive-fizzbuzz" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p><code>proto-buzz</code> is a great motivating example of what I would like to call the
<em><strong>Non-Destructive</strong></em> FizzBuzz.</p>
<p>All the FizzBuzz solutions seen previously, except PeanoBuzz, lose information.
This is almost always bad because its impossible to reverse information loss.
The inverse is also true. It is almost always good to <em>augment</em> information.
Prefer to enrich information and retain as much as resources permit (organised
neatly, of course). Ask any lawyer or accountant or friendly neighbourhood
Clojurian which alternative would set their hair on fire.</p>
<p>Here I play with some more ways to FizzBuzz non-destructively.</p>
<p>As I do, I meditate upon the extra super nice thing about <code>proto-buzz</code>.
Which is that we did <em>not</em> have to invent a new number system or box numbers
in some composite FizzBuzz data representation <em>and</em> we lost no functionality
— numbers still behave exactly as we expect, with zero added overhead!</p>
<h3 id="composite-data-buzz">Composite Data Buzz<a href="#composite-data-buzz" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>PeanoBuzz was an example of writing FizzBuzz in terms of “composite” data.
Abstractly, that idea is basically “attach some meta-data to my things”.</p>
<p>PeanoBuzz was a tuple <code>[3 &#34;Fizz&#34;]</code>, but it could very well have been a custom
map representation, say, <code>{:n 3 :fizzbuzz &#34;Fizz&#34;}</code>.</p>
<p>We can do one better by using Clojure Records to attach full-blooded Java
types to our numbers <sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> <em>and also</em> make “composite” data, because
Records give us all the features of generic hash-maps for free.</p>

<h3 id="tagged-literal-buzz">Tagged Literal Buzz<a href="#tagged-literal-buzz" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Thinking aloud…</p>
<p>Clojure has a concept of “tagged literals”; plaintext labels that we can
“attach” to data <em>without</em> changing the literal value of our data, <em>and</em>
transmit over wires along with the data.</p>
<p>Clojure provides built-in support for a small set of some fairly universal
types of literals (instant, UUID etc.). And I have used fancier tagged
literals, but only in context of other people’s libraries (<a href="https://github.com/juxt/aero">juxt/aero</a>).</p>
<p>How to make this work, I wonder?</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>ns </span>tagged.buzz)

<p>Well, in one word, <em><strong>Transducers</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Which you can assume is Clojurish for “You haven’t decomplected your Clojure
quite enough just yet.”. But before we go there, a quick survey.</p>
<p>Thus far, we have pulled apart the FizzBuzz problem space in many dimensions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculation v/s Effects (lifted out <code>println</code>)</li>
<li>Calculation v/s Sequence generation (lifted fizzbuzz logic out of <code>for</code>)</li>
<li>Definition v/s Realisation (lazy definitions like <code>all-fizz-buzzes</code>)</li>
<li>Lifted out concepts in the domain of the <em>solution</em> (<code>fizzes?</code> <code>buzzes?</code> etc.)</li>
<li>Lifted out concepts in the domain of the <em>problem</em> (modulo math FizzBuzzes)</li>
<li>Lifted all fizzbuzzes out of the concrete 3/5 FizzBuzz (<code>any-mod-cycle-buzz</code>)</li>
<li>Added Fizzbuzz-meaning to Numbers <em>without</em> changing existing Number-meaning
(protocols, and maybe also tagged literals if I can make it work sensibly)</li>
<li>Concrete Numbers v/s abstract representations (PeanoBuzz, <code>mod-cycle-buzz</code>)</li>
<li>Calculation v/s Specification (<code>spec-parse-buzz</code>)</li>
<li>We even teased apart <em>printing context</em> (wicked <code>pprint-buzz</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that <em><strong>all of this belongs in the real-world Clojurian’s design toolbox</strong>.</em></p>
<p>Not only do we do it “in the small”, in our little namespaces and <del>monoliths</del>
polyliths, we also do it “in the large” in our data-center-spanning distributed
systems.</p>
<p>But you see, in all the teasing apart so far, we <em>implied</em> FizzBuzz was
in-memory sequence processing. What if we <em>could not make any assumption
whatsoever</em> about data source, or data size, or data format, or process
control, or the output sink? Can we still describe FizzBuzz in some useful way?</p>
<p>Well, in one word, <em><strong>Transducers</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Savvy Clojurians may appreciate that text above has <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/transducers#%5Fterminology">transducer signature</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(whatever, input -&gt; whatever) -&gt; (whatever, input -&gt; whatever)</p>

<p>This is really my feeble attempt to nerdsnipe you into falling into deep
abstraction territory.</p>
<p>I pray that you give yourself time to <em>absorb</em> transducers. Peruse the code
below. Then peruse the list of stimulating material that follows, over a
relaxed weekend with several cups of delicious artisanal Oolong to salve
the brain pain.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-we-decomplecting">What are we decomplecting?<a href="#what-are-we-decomplecting" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h3>
<p>Because, with <em><strong>transducers</strong></em>, we will now <em>also</em> pull apart:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data source (sequence, stream, channel, socket etc.)</li>
<li>Data sink (sequence, stream, channel, socket etc.)</li>
<li>Data transformer (function of any value -&gt; any other value)</li>
<li>Data transformation process (mapping, filtering, reducing etc.)</li>
<li>Some process control (we can transduce finite data (of course) as well as
streams, and also have optional early termination in either case. I’m not
sure about first-class support for other methods like backpressure.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, for useful computations, we have to compose these back in some
sensible way, appropriate to the context at hand (e.g. read numbers off a
Kafka topic, FizzBuzz them, and send them to another Kafka topic, OR slurp
numbers from file on disk, FizzBuzz them, and push into an in-memory queue).</p>
<p>A word of caution. As you read, you may think “Ew, he peddles oldass Unix
Pipes.&#34; <sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> (or shiny new Monads or Lambda Architecture(TM) or some
familiar-to-you generics). You won’t be <em>wrong</em>. You won’t be <em>right</em> either.</p>
<p>Because, as is true for all sufficiently abstract abstractions, analogies
are not equivalences. Details differ deeply and your brain will hurt at first.
A lot. For example, it is <em>not</em> obvious <em>why</em>, but the transducer’s mandate
of <em>a la carte</em> re-composition <em>demands</em> that <em>all</em> the new pulling apart
<em>must be fully compatible</em> with <em>all</em> the old pulling apart.</p>
