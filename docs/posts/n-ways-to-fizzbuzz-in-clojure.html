    <h1>n ways to FizzBuzz in Clojure</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div>
<p>FizzBuzz is everywhere. Every programmer passes through its rite of passage,
or at least bears witness to another. Over the years, many gentlenerds have
taken it upon themselves to discover ever new ways to incant those hoary symbols.</p>
<p>I hereby enjoin these few drops of Clojure to that roiling ocean of FizzBuzzery.</p>
<p>The brainwave here is to (mis)use the feature set of Clojure and its standard
library to cook up as many ways to encode FizzBuzz as one can muster (or steal).
If all goes well, this post will receive many updates. If it goes <em>really</em>
well, all sorts of bad ideas and clever foot-guns will be discovered and used.</p>
<p>Not to be indelicate, but I will state the problem before proceeding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.
Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by
three with the word “fizz”, and any number divisible by five with the word “buzz”.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz%5Fbuzz">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz%5Fbuzz</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, they mean natural numbers when they say “numbers”.</p>
<p>Phew that was rough on the ego. Let us compose ourselves for a minute.</p>

<p>Reading the code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Find the <code>check-all-fizz-buzzers</code> function below, for usage examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use functions only from Clojure’s standard library (clojure.core).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lookup unfamiliar functions at <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/quickref">https://clojuredocs.org/quickref</a>, helpfully

<p>Running the code:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you don’t already have <a href="https://clojure.org/guides/getting%5Fstarted">Clojure installed</a>,
you can run the code online at <a href="https://tryclojure.org/">https://tryclojure.org/</a> (fully client-side,
but minimalist), or at <a href="https://repl.it/languages/clojure">https://repl.it/languages/clojure</a> (feature-rich

<li>
<p>Preferably, copy over code as you go along. Try it out bit by bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are in a hurry, find the “Interlude” section and copy over all the
code from there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, run <code>(check-all-fizz-buzzers)</code> to see if it all works as expected.</p>

<p>In the beginning, one might trawl the Clojure standard library for familiar,
safe-looking words and accidentally discover <code>for</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
Python or Javascript gentlenerds may say <em>“Ooh, List Comprehension. Nice!&#34;</em>,
and bang out <em>Le FizzBuzz Classique</em>. Java or C# gentlenerds may struggle a
lot more, because Clojure has no <code>Class</code>. We are sorry for this disappointment.
Please follow the Python for now.</p>

<p>Sadly, the spurious nils are the least of your woes. You just fell prey to
something called “Laziness”, and the code is dead on arrival, but you don’t
know it yet because evaluating <em>in</em> the “REPL” obscures this fact.</p>
<p>Welcome to Functional Programming (FP) with lazy sequences, which is <em>awesome</em>,
but which is also one of the double edges of Clojure that will cut you if you
come here with set ideas about How Things Ought To Work.</p>
<p>Saying it in French (however broken) felt gentler, somehow.</p>
<p>At this point, you might accuse me of setting you up with this strawman <code>for</code>.
In response, I might simply wait for your production to blow up. Unknowing
mixing of laziness and side effects reliably trips up all programmers new to
Clojure <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Luckily we can avoid going down that rabbit hole <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> entirely, because
there is a more pressing problem that makes <em>Le FizzBuzz Classique</em> look
severely defective to this Clojurist’s FP-addled brain. Fixing that makes the
point of lazy sequences moot, as a nice bonus.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Well, that’s because all expressions in Clojure return a value. <code>println</code>
creates a side effect of printing and has a return value of <code>nil</code>. Thus for
each item in the input range, the “impure” classic version prints to the REPL,
collects the return value of each println (nil), and returns that collection.</p>
<p>The “purified” fizz-buzz simply calculates a result for each branch and the
<code>for</code> returns the accumulated result. And now the results are printed inside
parentheses, which is, like, sure whatever. At least it <em>looks</em> like it’s
doing the right calculations <em>and</em> the pesky nils are gone, so we can move on?</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<h2 id="le-fizzbuzz-classique-dissected">Le FizzBuzz Classique, dissected<a href="#le-fizzbuzz-classique-dissected" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>To FizzBuzz creatively in Clojure, we must examine <em>and avoid</em> the defects of
the classic version, which are as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Broken behaviour</strong>: <code>println</code> alters the state of the world and thus
injects non-determinism into an otherwise purely functional calculation.
This is anathema <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> to Clojurists (and FP practitioners at large).</li>
<li><strong>Broken API contract</strong>: We get back a useless collection nils, instead of the
result of a calculation that we can use further. We prefer to always write
functions that return useful values.</li>
<li><strong>Broken time model</strong>: Effects want to happen “now” (here, printing to
some output device), while lazy computations want to happen “maybe never”
(here, a definition that maps the domain of a collection of countless
numbers to the domain of FizzBuzz). Effects and laziness can be made to
pair well, <em>but only when</em> we define them separately from the get go, and
have some third way of joining them together safely when needed. For now,
you could do worse than lasering this into your brain: “Never mix (side)
effects and laziness.”.</li>
<li><strong>Broken aesthetic</strong>: We like our functions to do one job, and do it well.
Printing things is a <em>second</em> job, and as Messers Hal and Gerry like to
say in SICP <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, “That’s George’s problem.”.</li>
</ol>
<p>Henceforth, all functions shall be pure calculations, and we will rely on
our metaphorical George “the REPL” Ableman to handle all our print jobs.</p>
<p>As an added benefit, writing pure functions makes laziness such a good friend,
that we don’t even need to acknowledge its presence.</p>
<p>Yet another benefit is that we won’t have to burn hundreds of words to apologise
for broken code <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p>See? Such passion. I wasn’t joking when I said “looks severely defective to me” <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="le-fizzbuzz-classique-doseq-d">Le FizzBuzz Classique, doseq’d<a href="#le-fizzbuzz-classique-doseq-d" arialabel="Anchor">⌗</a> </h2>
<p>Maybe you still aren’t convinced. <code>println</code> is such a global standard. <em>Easy</em> <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.
So you might dig into the standard library more and come up with <code>doseq</code> to
eliminate laziness…</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>doseq-fizz-buzz
  [num-xs]

      (zero? (rem n <span>3</span>)) (println <span>&#34;Fizz&#34;</span>)
      (zero? (rem n <span>5</span>)) (println <span>&#34;Buzz&#34;</span>)
      <span>:else</span> (println n))))
</code></pre></div><p>And declare victory…</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure">user=&gt; (<span>doseq-fizz-buzz</span> (list <span>1</span> <span>3</span> <span>5</span> <span>15</span> <span>19</span>))
<span>1</span>
Fizz
Buzz
FizzBuzz
<span>19</span>
nil <span>; maybe we can live with just one nil?</span>
</code></pre></div><p>But the code is still fatally broken for the other reasons, and now <em>it is
also worse</em>, because this implementation cannot say “here are <em>all</em> the
fizzbuzzes”. Only a lazy definition can say this <em>and</em> allow you to carry on
computing. Besides, <code>doseq</code> is meant for cases when we <em>want to cause</em> side
effects. And the functional Clojurist almost never <em>wants</em> to.</p>
<p>Remember the children’s game definition of FizzBuzz? It is beautiful because
it <em>does not</em> say “FizzBuzz only for the first K numbers”. Now if you go
DuckDuck search the standard coding interview version of the question, what
do you find? “Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100
such that…”.</p>
<p>Boo.</p>

<p>As a famous TV detective would say; “Oh, just one other thing.”. Here are ways
to break your programs. And if you are feeling suitably adventurous, to also
test the stability of your employment.</p>
<p>The following invocation of <code>lazybuzz</code> in your <code>-main</code> would not be fine,
assuming you wanted to do something useful with it. But would also not
precipitate anything terrible.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>-main

  <span>;; No block, no foul.</span>
  (<span>lazybuzz</span> (<span>range</span>))

  <span>;; Sure, why not ...</span>
  (println <span>&#34;I&#39;m done!&#34;</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>Here is a good way to break your software and print FizzBuzzes to the console
indefinitely (or at least as long as your computer can make new numbers).</p>

  (<span>doseq-fizz-buzz</span> (<span>range</span>))

  <span>;; Maybe never ...</span>
  (println <span>&#34;I&#39;m done!&#34;</span>))
</code></pre></div><p>As a funner party trick, if you make a computer (VM) with a bad output device
(or redirect program output to /dev/full), then you can crash or hang your
program. If you discover it crashes, feel free to daemonise it and make an
infinitely restarting JVM process that does nothing but burn CPU cycles.
Take that, cryptominers!</p>
<p>To be fair, you can also break programs with lazy evaluation, with the added
benefit of doing it silently. But at least you are forced to say <code>doall</code>,
which might make you feel at least a tiny bit guilty.</p>

<p>Once we remove the <em>ick</em> of <code>println</code> from our code, we can see further room
for improvement. <code>(zero? (rem n divisor))</code> is not only a common pattern,
it is actually a distinct <em>idea</em>, viz. “Is <code>n</code> <em>divisible</em> by <code>divisor</code>?”.</p>
<p>We can name it locally, with <code>let</code>.</p>

  (<span>fn </span>[n1 n2] (rem n1 n2)))
</code></pre></div><p>Yep, <code>defn</code> is just <code>def</code> + <code>fn</code> under the hood, and we can conveniently
write the same thing as follows.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="clojure">(<span>defn </span>divisible?

they are drop-in replacements for each other (“referentially transparent”).
Use whichever version you like best.</p>
<p>It may seem silly to write such tiny functions, but we earn a lot of firepower
by lifting out named domain concepts, <em>especially</em> the simple ones, because
we can <em>compose</em> them flexibly to express other domain concepts as needed.</p>

placed successively. Also rely on “truthiness” in Clojure to imply yes/no.</p>

<p>You might protest that well actually the clever little functions, in fact,
express the domain of the <em>solution</em> (the business of calculating FizzBuzz),
not the domain of the <em>problem</em> (arithmetic representation of FizzBuzz).</p>
<p>And even though I flunked maths a lot, I would concur. So here goes nothing…</p>
<p>15 is the highest common factor. Suppose we cook up an encoding scheme based
on remainders of 15, and write it down as a lookup table? We can then find
<code>(rem n 15)</code>, and look up the answer to FizzBuzz in the table.</p>
