<p>I didn’t get through too many books this year, I’m afraid. Some combination of work, tennis, and too many video games ate into my reading time. I’ll try again next year!</p>

<p>I read the first two books of the Stormlight Archive: <em>The Way of Kings</em> and <em>Words of Radiance</em>. This is currently a five book series with more on the way. Anyways, I’ve heard others claim that this is Sanderson’s best series, and I can see why. The books follow several characters, most notably Kaladin, Shallin, Dalinar, and Adolin, in war with a world with a mysterious history, and several factions aiming to gain advantage. This takes place in a setting containing advanced ancient weaponry, and a weakly understood magic system that a handful are able to wield. Really fun, page-turning fiction. Hoping to read more this year!</p>

<p>I enjoy these kind of pop-psych books that Gladwell writes. They’re fun to read, and I don’t always agree with the conclusions he draws, but there are always some interesting anecdotes and thought provoking stories.</p>

<p>The author chatted at Stripe earlier this year and was pretty interesting, so I picked up his book. <em>Order without Design</em> explores the intersection of market economics and urban planning. It’s a bit wonkish at times which made it difficult to read casually after a long work day. But, with some downtime around the holiday, I enjoyed spending several hours reading through it. The chapter on housing was particularly compelling.</p>
