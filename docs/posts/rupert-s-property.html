<p>You can cut a hole in a cube that’s big enough to slide an identical cube through that hole!   Think about that for a minute—it’s kind of weird.</p>
<p>Amazingly, nobody could prove any convex polyhedron <i>doesn’t</i> have this property!  It’s called ‘Rupert’s property’.</p>
<p>Until this week.</p>
<p>This week Steininger and Yurkevich proved there is a convex polyhedron that you <i>can’t</i> cut a hole in big enough to slide the entire polyhedron through the hole.  It has 90 vertices, and <a href="https://mamot.fr/@Gallorum/115105837385538994">apparently</a> 240 edges and 152 faces.</p>

<p>To prove that no such hole is possible, they had to do a computer search of 18 million different holes, plus use a lot of extra math to make sure they’d checked enough possibilities:</p>
<p>• Jakob Steininger and Sergey Yurkevich, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18475">A convex polyhedron without Rupert’s property</a>.</p>
<p>To celebrate their discovery, they gave this polyhedron a silly name.  Since this polyhedron lacks Rupert’s property, they called it a ‘noperthedron’.</p>
<p>Why is this property called ‘Rupert’s property’?  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Rupert%27s_cube">Wikipedia</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>
In geometry, <b>Prince Rupert’s cube</b> is the largest cube that can pass through a hole cut through a unit cube without splitting it into separate pieces. Its side length is approximately 1.06, 6% larger than the side length 1 of the unit cube through which it passes. The problem of finding the largest square that lies entirely within a unit cube is closely related, and has the same solution.</p>
<p>Prince Rupert’s cube is named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Rupert_of_the_Rhine">Prince Rupert of the Rhine</a>, who asked whether a cube could be passed through a hole made in another cube of the same size without splitting the cube into two pieces. A positive answer was given by John Wallis. Approximately 100 years later, Pieter Nieuwland found the largest possible cube that can pass through a hole in a unit cube.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here Greg Egan shows how Rupert’s property works for the cube:</p>

<p>Here he shows how it works for the regular octahedron:</p>

</p>
<p>And finally, here’s a video by David Renshaw showing 26 polyhedra with Rupert’s property… and 5 polyhedra that might lack it:</p>

<p>The triakis tetrahedron is an extremely close call, but it does have Rupert’s property:</p>
