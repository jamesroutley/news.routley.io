<h3><mark>Brain-computer interface is PiEEG</mark></h3>



<p><mark>This project is the result of several years of work on the development of Brain-computer interface (BCI) for measure EEG, EMG and EKG. We want to provide an easy way to get started with biosignals to use a shield. We will try to reveal the process of reading EEG signals as fully and clearly as possible.</mark></p>



<p><mark>At its core, PiEEG is an open-source Raspberry Pi shield that effortlessly measures various biosignals, including electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), and Electrocardiography ECG. Its versatility, user-friendly interface, and compatibility with diverse electrode types set it apart. With this Brain-computer interface, all you need to do is connect the electrodes and run a Python script to start capturing bio-signals.</mark></p>
