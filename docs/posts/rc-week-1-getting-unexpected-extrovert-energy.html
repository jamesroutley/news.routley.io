    <h1>RC Week 1: Getting Unexpected Extrovert Energy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    

    <p><strong>Saturday, September 24, 2022</strong></p>

    <p>The first week of my batch at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/">Recurse Center</a> (RC) just finished, and it was an intense week!
I&#39;m planning to write a blog post each week about my experience at RC.
They&#39;ll vary, but it&#39;ll probably be a mixture of what I did and my feelings about everything.
There won&#39;t be <em>too</em> much technical contentâ€”I&#39;m planning to write individual blog posts on specific things I&#39;m learning.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re wondering why I&#39;m attending, take a look at my blog post <a href="https://ntietz.com/tech-blog/going-to-recurse-center/">announcing my sabbatical</a>.</p>

<p>The week was really great, and also a lot.</p>
<p>I am normally very drained by socializing, and this week had a ton of that.
I was expecting to be very drained, because I identify as an introvert, and yet...
I got this weird extrovert energy from all my conversations!
I&#39;d come out of each one charged up and ready to keep going and doing more and more!
When I talked about this, I found out this is an experience shared by some others.</p>
<p>For me, I think it&#39;s the culture, the people, and just the sheer excitement of being here, but I&#39;m not really sure at all.
I want to learn two things:
How can I capture this energy outside of RC at a day job?
And how do I create this sort of culture in other places?
I&#39;m looking forward to seeing if this continues, wears off, or changes.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what I did this week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Had 7+ coffee chats</li>
<li>Went to 2 mixer meet and greets</li>
<li>Had 4 pair programming sessions</li>
<li>Attended a ton of events</li>
<li>Formed a home lab discussion group</li>
<li>Formed a <a href="http://www.redbook.io">Red Book</a> reading group</li>
<li>Stood up a process for my <a href="https://github.com/ntietz/anode-kv">KV store</a> (it does hardly anything, but it parses requests and responds with errors!)</li>
<li>Started on my <a href="https://github.com/ntietz/patzer">chess engine</a> and detoured into GUI programming to make something visual</li>
<li>Implemented a couple of initial dummy chess strategies (first-legal-move and random-move)</li>
<li>Started using Obsidian to take notes, and enjoyed it a lot</li>
<li>Ordered a new-to-me used server (technically, a workstation) for use in my performance testing</li>
<li>Figured out the source of my arm pain and resolved it. <strong>I can use a keyboard full time again!</strong> ðŸŽ‰</li>
<li>Got a cold and used a ton of tissues ðŸ¤’</li>
</ul>
<p>My week was very weighted toward social things.
I wanted to meet as many people as possible and try out all the events before focusing more.
Next week I&#39;m going to pare it down a little and dig deeper into my projects.</p>

<p>I learned a few things this week.</p>
<p><strong>Pair programming is hard.</strong>
It&#39;s really freaking hard.
If you&#39;re not careful (and, reader, I&#39;m not careful) it can turn into performance, and that is not what it&#39;s supposed to be!
I&#39;m working through some feelings of needing to be right, needing to not flail around or be ignorant when I&#39;m the driver.
Fellow Recursers have given me some really great advice on how to work on this.
Next week, pairing will be a focus, and I am looking forward to the practice!</p>
<p><strong>Recurse Center is a magical place.</strong>
Yeah, I know, everyone says this.
It&#39;s true, though.
This is an amazingly supportive environment and I cannot imagine a better place to learn.
But check back in with me in 11 more weeks.
If there&#39;s a honeymoon phase, I&#39;m still in it!</p>
<p><strong>Plans are helpful, as long as you&#39;re flexible.</strong>
This was advice given to me by some RC alumni: Come in with a plan, but be willing to deviate as you discover what you&#39;re interested in.
I am <em>so</em> glad that people told me that, because I do have a tendency to stick to a plan and I can get anxious if I don&#39;t follow through.
This week, the main way I bent my plan was by leaning into GUI programming.
I&#39;ve never made a native GUI before, and it was a very different and <em>very</em> fun experience.
If someone hadn&#39;t told me explicitly to be flexible in my plans, I may not have done that!</p>
<p><strong>GUI programming is really fun!</strong>
I&#39;m using <a href="https://github.com/emilk/egui">egui</a>, an immediate mode GUI library for Rust.
It has been more intuitive for me than Qt or GTK were when I tried those, but that was also... over a decade ago.
(Yikes.)
It&#39;s definitely more intuitive for me than React.
We&#39;ll see if it remains that way when state gets more complicated in my application!</p>

<p>Next week I&#39;m going to cut back on the social side to make more time for pair programming.
I&#39;m going to go to the groups that are most relevant to what I want to learn at RC, and skip those that aren&#39;t as relevant.</p>
<p>I want to have a coffee chat with someone each day, and I want to pair program each day.
These are &#34;best effort&#34; attempts.
If I don&#39;t hit daily I won&#39;t feel bad, but that&#39;s the goal.</p>
<p>For my KV store, my goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement the ECHO, GET, and SET Redis commands</li>
<li>Run a benchmark of those commands and compare to Redis</li>
<li>Start learning how to figure out why they&#39;re slower than Redis! (Just going to assume they will be haha.)</li>
</ul>
<p>For my chess engine, my goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the GUI interactive, so we can play the engine. (I think this will be easier than implementing <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/UCI">UCI</a>, but I&#39;ll do that eventually as well.)</li>
<li>Implement a slightly-better search algorithm (requires implementing evaluation as well), like minimax</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with those, I have a few ancillary things I&#39;m going to work on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxmox_Virtual_Environment">Proxmox</a> on my server and set up my home lab so I can drag race databases. I&#39;m probably going to learn Ansible to manage it.</li>
<li>Write a blog post on the paper I&#39;m reading for the Red Book reading group</li>
<li>Finish up a blog post draft I have sitting in my backlog, and maybe give a presentation on it at RC (it&#39;s about coding by voice!)</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>I think that&#39;s all I wanted to say about this week!
