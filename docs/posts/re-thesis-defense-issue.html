I haven’t heard from Annie. Does anyone have her cell? Given the date, she might not be checking email right now.  Under the assumption that “provided” was a mistake, though, I’m going to contact Jordan Fiorucci at the graduate school and see what we can do. They have pretty firm rules about requesting snakes a minimum of two weeks early so that they can have the snake prepared, though, so we might be in trouble. I’ll keep everyone posted as soon as I know more.</p><p>Jennifer, I’m cc’ing you on this so that you can be prepared to approve in Richard’s place if needed (chair of department can override a missing approval).</p><p>Thanks-</p><p>Linda</p><p>--------</p><p><b>From:</b> Petroski, Linda &lt;<a href="https://vaibhavsagar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="02726776706d71696b37426063706c6776762c676677">[email protected]</a>&gt;</p><p>Hi, Jordan-</p><p>I’ve got a student (Robin Kahler, kahler22) who’s supposed to be defending next week, needs a snake, and put “provided” on the application form by accident.
