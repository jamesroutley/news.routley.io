I haven’t heard from Annie. Does anyone have her cell? Given the date, she might not be checking email right now.  Under the assumption that “provided” was a mistake, though, I’m going to contact Jordan Fiorucci at the graduate school and see what we can do. They have pretty firm rules about requesting snakes a minimum of two weeks early so that they can have the snake prepared, though, so we might be in trouble. I’ll keep everyone posted as soon as I know more.</p><p>Jennifer, I’m cc’ing you on this so that you can be prepared to approve in Richard’s place if needed (chair of department can override a missing approval).</p><p>Thanks-</p><p>Linda</p><p>--------</p><p><b>From:</b> Petroski, Linda &lt;<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7b0b1e0f09140810124e3b191a09151e0f0f551e1f0e">[email protected]</a>&gt;</p><p>Hi, Jordan-</p><p>I’ve got a student (Robin Kahler, kahler22) who’s supposed to be defending next week, needs a snake, and put “provided” on the application form by accident.

We have a new director of grad studies, and I guess he didn’t realize that he should double-check the snake request on these forms (and the advisor didn’t check either...).

They’ll need the DGS and their committee (plus the chair) to approve today, plus the snake affidavit from the advisor- we won’t be able to get the forms generated in time if we wait until after the holiday. The other issue is facilities. If they don’t have a snake available, they don’t have a snake.

Robin, you’re going to need to cancel your application and submit a new application with the correct snake request information.
