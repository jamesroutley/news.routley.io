<p>How good are these site builders? <em>I don’t know.</em></p>
<p>Are you worried about job security? <em>I have two thoughts…</em></p>
<h2 id="1-weve-seen-this-before">1. We’ve seen this before</h2>
<p>Wordpress, Squarespace, Shopify, Webflow… all these tools made it easier for anyone to spin up a basic website. And yet, the world has always needed more web developers. Why? Well, some people need more than just a basic website. Some people are trying to build apps and tools that have never been built before. A lot of my current work is supporting custom features that span multiple teams, codebases, and services. I think we’re still a long way from AI doing all of that.</p>
<h2 id="2-the-world-is-always-changing">2. The world is always changing</h2>
<p>Maybe this time it’s different, and the tools really will make web developers obsolete (including me). If so, what then?</p>
<p>I’d lose my job. That sucks. But when I think about it, I don’t want a job per se. I want security and fulfillment.</p>
<p>There are a lot of paths to security and fulfillment and I don’t think my current job, or even my current career, is the only one. It takes some effort and creativity to get yourself into a career that works for you but I’ve done it before and I can do it again. I know my strengths and weaknesses, and there is no shortage of interesting problems in the world. Who knows, maybe I can use AI to help me solve some of them.</p>
<p>The world is always changing. We can try to resist it, or we can change with it.</p>
