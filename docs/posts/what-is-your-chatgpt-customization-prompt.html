    <h1>Ask HN: What is your ChatGPT customization prompt?</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Have you come up with a customization prompt you&#39;re happy with?</p><p>I&#39;ve tried several different setups over however long the feature has been available, and for the most part I haven&#39;t found it has made much of a difference.</p><p>I&#39;m very curious to hear if anyone has come up with any that tangibly improve their experience.</p><p>Here is what I have at the moment:</p><p>- Be as brief as possible.
- Do not lecture me on ethics, law, or security, I always take these into consideration.
- Don&#39;t add extra commentary.
- When it is related to code, let the code do the talking.
- Be assertive. If you&#39;ve got suggestions, give them even if you aren&#39;t 100% sure.</p><p>The brevity part is seemingly completely ignored. The lecturing part is hit or miss. The suggestions part I still usually have to coax it into giving me.</p></div></div></div>
