    <h1>Future of OSU Open Source Lab in Jeopardy</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I am writing to inform you about a critical and time-sensitive situation facing the Open Source Lab. Over the past
several years, we have been operating at a deficit due to a decline in corporate donations. While OSU’s College of
Engineering (CoE) has generously filled this gap, recent changes in university funding have led to a significant
reduction in CoE’s budget. As a result, our current funding model is no longer sustainable and CoE needs to find ways
to cut programs.</p><p>Earlier this week, I was informed that unless we secure $250,000 in committed funds, the OSL will be forced to shut
down later this year. I have reached out to our largest corporate sponsor and they are working to increase their
support as we update our contract, but that still may not be enough.</p><p>For transparency, the $250,000 is broken down into the following roughly:</p><ul><li>Staff pay $150k (60%) (1 staff)</li><li>Student pay $65k (26%) (8 students)</li><li>Other expenses $35k (14%)</li></ul><p>Other expenses include items such as hardware, travel, subscription services and other miscellaneous expenses needed to
run the OSL day to day.</p><p>If any of you can assist or connect me with potential supporters, please reach out as soon as possible. I need to
provide leadership with an update on any funding changes by <strong>Wednesday, May 14, 2025</strong>. Please reach out directly via
<em><strong><a href="mailto:donations@osuosl.org">donations@osuosl.org</a></strong></em> if you’re able to help us make it through this difficult time.</p><p>The OSU Foundation is an IRS 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, which provides many donors a tax advantage. Please
contact the OSU Foundation directly if you have questions about your eligibility. You can donate directly to us by
visiting our <a href="https://osuosl.org/donate">donation page</a>.</p><p>OSL provides hosting for over 500 Free and Open Source Projects from all over the world. Over the course of its 22-year
existence, the OSL has mentored over 130 students, many of whom have gone on to create their own companies and work
throughout the larger tech ecosystem.</p><p>Some notable milestones over the years include:</p><ul><li>Provided hosting for Mozilla Firefox when they needed help in the early days and hosted the release of 1.0</li><li>Was the home of the Apache Software Foundation, Linux Foundation, Kernel.org, Mozilla for many years</li><li>Offers fast and reliable software mirroring for projects</li><li>Currently provides infrastructure hosting for projects such as Drupal, Gentoo Linux, Debian, Fedora, phpBB, OpenID,
Buildroot/Busybox, Inkscape, Cinc and many more!</li><li>Virtual machines for x86, aarch64 and ppc64le are used by many projects for CI and other hosted services</li></ul><p>Additionally, the university has long-term plans to deprecate the data center where all of our hosting is currently
located. Much of the university hosting has been moved to the cloud or the state data center, and OSU lacks the funds
to replace the aging UPS/HVAC systems. I am actively seeking a new location to host our systems, but finding suitable
data center space on campus has proven to be extremely challenging.</p><p>To be clear: OSL’s immediate need is securing additional funding, the data center situation can be worked on later.
Your commitment is crucial for us to move forward. I am available to answer any questions you might have.</p><p>Thank you for your continued support!</p><p>Lance Albertson, Director</p></div></div>
