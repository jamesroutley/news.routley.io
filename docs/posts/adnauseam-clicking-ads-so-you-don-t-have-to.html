          <p id="p1">As online advertising becomes ever more ubiquitous and unsanctioned,
            AdNauseam works to complete the cycle by automating ad clicks universally
            and blindly on behalf of its users. Built atop uBlock Origin, AdNauseam
            quietly clicks on every blocked ad, registering a visit on ad networks&#39;
            databases. As the collected data gathered shows an omnivorous click-stream, user
            tracking, targeting and surveillance become futile. Read more about AdNauseam in this <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1873/IWPE17_paper_23.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a>.</p>

          <p id="p2"><strong>AdNauseam</strong> is a free browser extension
            designed to obfuscate browsing data and protect users from tracking by advertising networks.
            At the same time, AdNauseam serves
            as a means of amplifying users&#39; discontent with advertising networks
            that disregard privacy and facilitate bulk surveillance agendas.</p>

          <p id="p3">AdNauseam joins a broader class of technical systems that attempt to serve
            ethical, political, and expressive ends. In light of the industry&#39;s
            <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/28/do_not_track_w3c_split/">failure</a>
            to self-regulate or otherwise address the excesses of network tracking, AdNauseam
            allows individual users to take matters into their own hands, fighting
            back against unilateral surveillance. Taken in this light, the software
            follows an approach similar to that of <a href="http://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/">TrackMeNot</a>,
            employing obfuscation as a strategy to shift the balance of power between
            the trackers and the tracked. For further information on this approach,
            please see this <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/resources/trackmenot2009.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
