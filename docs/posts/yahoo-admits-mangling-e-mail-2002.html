    <h1>Yahoo admits mangling e-mail (2002)</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div face="sans-serif" size="2">

	If you have a Yahoo.com e-mail account and have wondered why some messages contain words such as &#34;medireview&#34; and &#34;reviewuate&#34;, then wonder no longer. 
</p><p>
Yahoo has admitted that it has been changing some of the words inside attachments accompanying messages sent to users of its web-based e-mail system.
</p><p>
The company said it had taken the action to prevent the spread of viruses.
</p><p>
However, critics have said that the filtering system is too crude and is having unforeseen effects. 
</p><p>
<b>Foolish filter</b>
</p><p>
Some users of the Yahoo.com mail service are complaining that the changed words are scrambling the sense of academic papers and business documents.
</p><p>
Yahoo&#39;s filtering system was intended to stop the spread of viruses that lurk inside the computer code that defines the layout and appearance of a webpage.
</p><p>
This code, called HyperText Markup Language (HTML), can be made more interactive, animated and lively using another language called Javascript.

When web browsers encounter a chunk of Javascript, they automatically try to do what the code demands. 
</p><p>
The code is behind such things as visitor counters and can change the appearance of buttons and bars on a page when a mouse moves over them.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, some computer virus writers also use Javascript to set off malicious programs that, among other things, can kidnap personal information such as passwords or credit card numbers.
</p><p>
To prevent this happening Yahoo has been scanning HTML attachments on e-mail messages sent to Yahoo.com users looking for common commands that can be subverted. 
</p><p>
The practice has been going on since at least March 2001.
</p><p>
<b>Scrambled words</b>
</p><p>
Many people have found that Yahoo&#39;s filtering system is too crude and is scrambling innocent words.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the filter does not respect the boundaries of words. This means that when banned text appears inside another word, it gets converted too.
</p><p>
This has led to the appearance of strange words such as &#34;medireview&#34; instead of &#34;medieval&#34; and &#34;reviewuate&#34; instead of &#34;evaluate&#34;.
</p><p>
The filtering has scrambled e-mail addresses and led to puzzling changes in academic papers. 
</p><p>
Search engine Google lists over 600 sites using &#34;medireview&#34;.
</p><p> 
One article in the online edition of the Hindu newspaper even talks about the &#34;medireview&#34; Mughal emperors of India seemingly unaware that the word has no proper meaning.
</p><p>
Yahoo has yet to say whether it plans to stop checking and changing attachments.
