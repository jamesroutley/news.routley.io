    <h1>When Figma starts designing us</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><p>I first encountered Figma in 2013, when Dylan Field demoed an early prototype
to me at O’Reilly’s Foo Camp. I remember the pen tool feeling surprisingly
elegant, but I missed the bigger picture: the radical implications of a design
tool that ran in the browser. A decade later, Figma is a core part of our
creative process, and without it, we wouldn&#39;t have been able to build a fully
remote design practice. That’s probably why Dylan is a near-billionaire and
I’m not.</p><p>However, over the course of the last five years, I’ve grown increasingly
worried about what Figma is doing to the field of design by pushing designers
toward an engineering-centric way of working. This can be seen in their
feature releases: Smart Components, Variables, Auto Layout, and Interactive
Prototypes. These features are often celebrated as steps toward parity with
engineering, but in practice, they encourage a mode of working that narrows
the field of possibility at precisely the moment when it should be expanding.</p><p>A concrete example is Auto Layout. It may seem harmless at first to introduce
a DOM-like layout mechanism in a design tool, and it certainly has advantages
in mature design files where the structure rarely changes. But many design
teams today use Auto Layout to create full page designs of their digital
products from the get-go. In practice, this locks the design in place and
severely limits the possible expressions. You can’t drag things around freely
or try odd combinations of layouts. You can’t simply paste something into a
frame without it snapping to the bottom of the stack. The result is that
designers are nudged into thinking like engineers during the earliest stages
of exploration just when they should be working messily, freely, and loosely.
It might feel convenient at first, but it comes at a cost. Have you ever
opened a Figma file and tried to make a small change, only to find yourself
wrestling with the layout? I’ve encountered this more often than I’d like, and
it seems to be increasing in frequency.</p><p>Another feature is Dev Mode, which, in theory, is the missing bridge between
the design specification and the technical implementation. However, it
enforces a mindset where designers polish designs far away from the technology
they are designing for, and where enormous amounts of time are spent on
building complex prototypes, only for them to be discarded and rebuilt in
code. This is all done in the name of making something ready for development.
This is contrary to my belief that any digital design process should start
with rough sketches, but move quickly into code and iterate from there. Those
sketches might even be done in code. A design is never “ready for dev”,
because a lot of what we consider to be design decisions – interaction,
animation, loading of data – can really only be prototyped in code. “Ready for
dev” implies that the creation is done and that the developer is merely there
to execute the designer’s vision, implicitly preventing them from questioning
any of the decisions when the rubber hits the road.</p><p>These are just two examples, but it illustrates a worrying trend towards a
premature optimization of design. These features encourage designers to make
decisions too early, to over-structure ideas before they’ve had a chance to
unfold. The result is a narrowing of the design space, where the flexibility
needed for creative discovery is replaced by enforced consistency and
structure. This comes on top of the incredible number of
<a href="https://designsystems.international/ideas/product-design-is-lost/">structured tasks</a>
that most modern design teams adhere to. This inevitably contributes to the
growing monoculture in digital design where everything starts to look and feel
the same, not because of shared intent, but because of shared constraints.</p><p>I’ve spent the last 15 years advocating for deeper collaboration between
designers and engineers, so it might seem contradictory to critique a tool
that brings those disciplines closer together. But interdisciplinary work
doesn’t mean collapsing into one way of thinking. The goal isn’t for designers
to adopt engineering practices, but to bring distinct perspectives through an
interdisciplinary way of collaborating.</p><p>Figma is extremely powerful, but it is bending us toward a way of working that
prioritizes structure over spontaneity. As designers, we should remain alert
to this shift, not because Figma is inherently bad, but because the values it
encodes can quietly reshape our practices. The best design work rarely starts
with order. It starts with questions, with play, with a lot of mess. We need
tools that make room for that. Because if everything is neatly aligned from
the beginning, we may never discover what lies just outside the grid.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
