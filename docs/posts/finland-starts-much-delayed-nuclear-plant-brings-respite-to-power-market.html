It is Finland&#39;s first new nuclear plant in over four decades and Europe&#39;s first in almost 15 years.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-2">Olkiluoto 3 started test production at just over 0.1 gigawatt, a small fraction of its capacity, with a ramp-up to full, regular electricity output planned by the end of July.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p data-testid="paragraph-3">&#34;OL3 significantly improves Finland&#39;s electricity self-sufficiency and helps in achieving carbon neutrality goals,&#34; operator Teollisuuden Voima (TVO) said in a statement.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-4">Once fully operational, it is expected to meet 14% of Finland&#39;s electricity demand, reducing the need for imports from Russia, Sweden and Norway.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-5">&#34;Olkiluoto 3 will decrease Finland&#39;s import dependency and it will become a cheaper price zone,&#34; Aurora Energy Research economist Alexander Esser told Reuters.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-6">Finland&#39;s net imports of power averaged 13 terawatt hours (TWh) over the last few years, which should drop to 5-8 TWh by 2025 with Olkiluoto 3 in operation, Esser said.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-7">Nuclear power remains controversial in Europe, with some countries such as Germany phasing out reactors amid safety concerns, while others including France and Britain discussing new developments. <a href="http://mattambrogi.bearblog.dev/world/europe/german-minister-urges-overhaul-eu-green-energy-finance-rules-2022-01-27/"> read more </a></p><p data-testid="paragraph-8">TVO is owned by Finnish utility Fortum <a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/FORTUM.HE" target="_blank">(FORTUM.HE)</a> and smaller energy and forestry firms.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-9">Finland is the only Nordic country with a large power deficit, said Marius Holm Rennesund, a partner at Oslo-based consultancy Thema.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-10">Thema predicts that Finnish wholesale power prices will drop to 60 euro per megawatt hour (MWh) in 2023 from a predicted average of 70 euro/MWh in 2022, although the expected reduction will also come from lower gas prices.</p><p data-testid="paragraph-11">In 2024, Finnish wholesale power prices will likely fall further to 45 euros/MWh, Rennesund said.</p><div><div><h5>Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com</h5></div></div><p><span>Reporting by Essi Lehto in Helsinki and Nora Buli in Oslo; editing by Terje Solsvik</span></p><p>Our Standards: <a href="https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en/about-us/trust-principles.html" target="_blank">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a></p></div></div>
