    <h1>Honeybee: Calling via XMPP</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="text-orgd52b3dc">
<p>
As such, I have started writing an XMPP client in zig for calling using the <a href="https://github.com/snikket-im/snikket-sdk">snikket sdk</a>.
The program is called <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~anjan/honeybee">honeybee</a> and it is currently in pre-alpha.
You control the daemon (honeybee) using honeybeec:
</p>

<div>
<pre>~/code/honeybee $ honeybeec help
info: usage:
info: status: print status of daemon
info: call &lt;jid&gt;: call &lt;jid&gt;
info: hangup &lt;jid&gt;: hangup from &lt;jid&gt;
info: accept_call &lt;jid&gt;: accept call from &lt;jid&gt;
info: dtmf &lt;dtmf_tone&gt;: send &lt;dtmf_tone&gt; to active call
</pre>
</div>


<p>
Even in this early stage, honeybee has dtmf support, basic call functionality, and hooks.
Since snikket-sdk is pre-pre-pre-alpha, honeybee should be treated as pre-pre-pre-alpha.
I need help!
If you want to make calls using emacs, please try out honeybee and send your improvements!
</p>

<p>
A cheogram account is only required if you want to make calls using the phone network.
You can call your XMPP friends using honeybee without a cheogram account.
</p>

<p>
Another goal of honeybee is to further investigate writing core sxmo components in system languages <sup><a id="fnr.4" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>.
I have already tried doing this with <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~anjan/peanutbutter">peanutbutter</a> - written in rust.
I chose zig for this project cause it is simpler than rust, itâ€™s error handling, and the build system is nice (easy static linking).
I do think relegating error handling and critical components to a systems languages will help reliability but most of the improvement in reliability will come from a simpler call stack.
Moreover, users can rest assured that even if honeybee fails, the missed call notification will be saved on the cheogram server and shown on their desktop/laptop.
By using Cheogram, users can call/text from their laptop/desktop using any client they want.
