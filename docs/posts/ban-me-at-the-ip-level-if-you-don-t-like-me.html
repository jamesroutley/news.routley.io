<h3><a rel="bookmark" name="2025-08-21.1" href="https://boston.conman.org/2025/08/21.1">“Bro, ban me at the IP level if you don&#39;t like me!”</a></h3>

<!-- Butlerian Jihad, bad webbots, Thinkbot, blocking by ASN -->

<p>More and more I think I&#39;m coming around to <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Butlerian_Jihad">Alex Schroeder&#39;s Butlerian Jihad</a>.
For reasons,
I&#39;m looking into web activity and so far,
the top webbot this month is one identifying itself as “Thinkbot,”
which <em>may</em> be related to <a href="https://www.thinkbot.agency/">this <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> company</a> but I can&#39;t be sure.
Here&#39;s how it identifies itself: “Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Thinkbot/0.5.8; +In­_the­_test­_phase,­_if­_the­_Thinkbot­_brings­_you­_trouble,­_please­_block­_its_<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>_address._Thank_you.)”.</p>

<p>Seriously,
that&#39;s it.
No <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> to read up on it.
It doesn&#39;t look at the <code>robots.txt</code> file.
Just “bro,
ban me at the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> level if you don&#39;t like me!”

</p><p>Yeah,
block its <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address.
You mean the 74 unique addresses it used this month alone?
<a href="https://boston.conman.org/2025/03/21.2">Checking each <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address for the <abbr title="Autonomous System Number">ASN</abbr> it&#39;s from</a> shows the 74 address coming from 41 (41!) network blocks!</p>

<p>A further check showed that all the network blocks are owned by one organization—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent">Tencent</a>.
I&#39;m seriously thinking that the <abbr title="Chinese Communist Party">CCP</abbr> encourage this with maybe the hope of externalizing the cost of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall">Great Firewall</a> to the rest of the world.
If China scrapes content,
that&#39;s fine as far as the <abbr title="Chinese Communist Party">CCP</abbr> goes;
If it&#39;s blocked,
that&#39;s fine by the <abbr title="Chinese Communist Party">CCP</abbr> too
(I say,
as I adjust my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_foil_hat">tin foil hat</a>).</p>

<p>In any case,
I added the following network blocks to my “badbots firewall rule set:”

</p><pre>43.130.0.0/18
43.130.64.0/18
43.130.128.0/19
43.130.160.0/19
43.131.0.0/18
43.132.192.0/18
43.133.64.0/19
43.134.128.0/18
43.135.0.0/18
43.135.64.0/18
43.135.192.0/19
43.153.0.0/18
43.153.192.0/18
43.154.64.0/18
43.154.128.0/18
43.154.192.0/18
43.155.0.0/18
43.155.128.0/18
43.156.192.0/18
43.157.0.0/18
43.157.64.0/18
43.157.128.0/18
43.159.128.0/19
43.163.64.0/18
43.164.192.0/18
43.165.128.0/18
43.166.128.0/18
43.166.224.0/19
49.51.132.0/23
49.51.140.0/23
49.51.166.0/23
101.32.0.0/20
101.32.48.0/20
101.33.64.0/19
119.28.64.0/19
119.28.128.0/20
129.226.160.0/19
150.109.32.0/19
150.109.96.0/19
170.106.32.0/19
170.106.176.0/20
</pre>

<p>The above list probably doesn&#39;t exhaustively enummerate Tencent&#39;s network block ownership,
but it&#39;s a start.
The above covers 476,590 unique <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> addresses
(excluding the base network and broadcast address for each network block).
I think it&#39;s bad that I had to do this,
but with the current landscape of the Internet,
it seems inevitable.
We can&#39;t have nice things it seems.</p>

        <p>You have my permission to link freely to any entry here.  Go
        ahead, I won&#39;t bite.  I promise.</p>
        
        <p>The dates are the permanent links to that day&#39;s entries (or
        entry, if there is only one entry).  The titles are the permanent
        links to <em>that</em> entry only.  The format for the links are
        simple: Start with the base link for this site: <a class="page" href="https://boston.conman.org/">https://boston.conman.org/</a>, then add the date you are
        interested in, say <a href="https://boston.conman.org/2000/08/01">2000/08/01</a>,
        so that would make the final <abbr title="Uniform Resource
        Locator">URL</abbr>:</p>
        
        <p><a class="page" href="https://boston.conman.org/2000/08/01">https://boston.conman.org/2000/08/01</a></p>
        
        <p>You can also specify the entire month by leaving off the day
        portion.  You can even select <a class="page" href="https://boston.conman.org/about/technical.html">an arbitrary portion of time.</a></p>
        
        <p>You may also note subtle shading of the links and that&#39;s
        intentional: the “closer” the link is (relative to the
        page) the “brighter” it appears.  It&#39;s an experiment in
        using color shading to denote the distance a link is from here.  If
        you don&#39;t notice it, don&#39;t worry; it&#39;s not all <em>that</em>
        important.</p>
