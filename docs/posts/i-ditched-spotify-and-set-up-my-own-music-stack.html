<p>For years, I relied on Spotify like millions of others. The convenience was undeniable stream anything, anywhere, discover new music through algorithms, and share playlists with friends. But over time, several issues became impossible to ignore: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Spotify#Allegations_of_unfair_artist_compensation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">artists getting paid fractions of pennies per stream</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy_over_fake_artists_on_Spotify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fake Artists and ghost Tracks</a>, <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/music-tech/recording/ill-never-be-able-to-sing-that-perfectly-in-tune-but-i-dont-want-to-im-human-meet-the-real-artists-that-are-victims-of-ai-fake-tracks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI music and impersonation</a>, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/spotify/spotify-introduces-face-scanning-age-checks-for-uk-uses-as-some-furious-fans-threaten-to-return-to-piracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creepy age verification complicity</a> and the fact that despite paying monthly, I never actually owned anything.
So I decided to take back control of my music experience. Here&#39;s how I built my own self-hosted music streaming setup that gives me everything Spotify offered and more.</p>

<p>At the core of my setup is <a href="https://www.navidrome.org/docs/installation/docker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Navidrome</a>, an open-source music server that handles streaming your personal music collection.</p>
<p><img src="https://leshicodes.github.io/assets/images/navidrome-62470ba14db4ff4a00eebfc17a06b528.png" alt="navidrome"/></p><p>To access my music from anywhere, I expose Navidrome via a <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CloudFlare Tunnel</a>, which provides secure access without exposing my home IP address or dealing with port forwarding.</p>
<p>For client apps, I use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser: Navidrome&#39;s built-in web player works perfectly</li>
<li>iOS: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/play-sub-music-streamer/id955329386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Play<!-- -->:Sub</a> connects seamlessly</li>

Like any tool, it can be misused.
Yes, people <em>could</em> point it at less-than-legal sources. No, I&#39;m not telling you to do that.
If you want to support artists, buy their work. If you don&#39;t, don&#39;t pretend Spotify streams are &#34;support.&#34;</p></div>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: Always ensure you&#39;re obtaining music through legal channels such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital purchases (Bandcamp, iTunes, Amazon, etc.)</li>
<li>Ripping CDs you&#39;ve purchased</li>
<li>Free legal downloads offered by artists</li>
<li>Music available under Creative Commons licenses</li>
</ul>
<p>My setup uses <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/sabnzbd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sabnzbd</a> integrated with Lidarr for handling downloads of content I&#39;ve purchased. Both services run in Docker containers and are NOT exposed to the internet for security.</p>

<p>Since lrcget is GUI-only (no CLI version yet), I&#39;m using a containerized version of it via <a href="https://www.kasmweb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasm</a> and access it through my browser. It&#39;s a bit resource-intensive, so I only run it when adding new music or updating lyrics.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve opened a <a href="https://github.com/tranxuanthang/lrcget/discussions/245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">feature request</a> for a CLI version, which would make this process more automation-friendly.</p>

<p><img src="https://leshicodes.github.io/assets/images/lidify-7c9fe9c04989d7b44fe3f586bcd83968.png" alt="lidify"/></p><p>One of Spotify&#39;s strongest features was music discovery. For this, I use <a href="https://github.com/TheWicklowWolf/Lidify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lidify</a>, which connects to my Lidarr library and Last.fm account to generate recommendations.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also connected my Last.fm scrobbles to <a href="https://listenbrainz.org/user/leshicodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ListenBrainz</a>, which promises to build weekly discovery playlists similar to Spotify&#39;s in the future.</p>
<h2 id="the-results">The Results<a href="#the-results" aria-label="Direct link to The Results" title="Direct link to The Results">​</a></h2>
<p>After several months with this setup, I&#39;m extremely satisfied with the results:</p>

<table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Spotify</th><th>My Self-Hosted Stack</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Music Quality</td><td>Up to 320kbps</td><td>Unlimited (FLAC/lossless)</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly Cost</td><td>$9.99-$14.99</td><td>One-time server setup + storage</td></tr><tr><td>Artist Payment</td><td>~$0.003-0.005 per stream</td><td>Direct support via purchases</td></tr><tr><td>Music Ownership</td><td>Rental only</td><td>Full ownership forever</td></tr><tr><td>Offline Access</td><td>Limited downloads</td><td>Complete library available</td></tr><tr><td>Privacy</td><td>Data collection &amp; tracking</td><td>Complete privacy</td></tr><tr><td>Content Permanence</td><td>Can disappear anytime</td><td>Never removed unless I choose</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>The initial setup took a weekend, but maintenance is minimal. When I want new music, Lidarr handles it automatically. If I need to manually add something, I just drop the files in the right folder and Navidrome indexes them immediately.</p>
<p>Is it for everyone? No. But if you care about music, value ownership, and have basic technical skills, building your own music streaming solution is both achievable and rewarding. The freedom from corporate streaming platforms is worth the effort.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-artists">Supporting Artists<a href="#supporting-artists" aria-label="Direct link to Supporting Artists" title="Direct link to Supporting Artists">​</a></h2>
<p>Moving away from Spotify doesn&#39;t mean abandoning artists. In fact, I now support musicians more directly by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing music directly from platforms like Bandcamp where artists receive 82-90% of sales</li>
<li>Buying physical media from official stores</li>
<li>Supporting Patreon/subscription services for favorite artists</li>
<li>Attending concerts and buying merchandise</li>
</ul>
<p>Buying a $10 album on Bandcamp puts about $8.20-$9.00 in the artist&#39;s pocket. To match that on Spotify, you&#39;re talking roughly 1.6k-3k streams of that album <strong>per listener</strong>. If the artist has a label taking a cut on Spotify, the stream counts needed go up further.</p>
<p>My self-hosted setup is about controlling my listening experience and owning what I pay for, not avoiding fair compensation to artists.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What&#39;s Next?<a href="#whats-next" aria-label="Direct link to What&#39;s Next?" title="Direct link to What&#39;s Next?">​</a></h2>
<p>I&#39;m continually refining this setup. Future improvements include automating the lyrics process and exploring more discovery tools. The beauty of a self-hosted solution is that it can evolve with my needs, rather than changing at the whim of a company&#39;s business model.</p></div></div>
