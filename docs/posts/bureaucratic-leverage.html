<p>Why do we hate bureaucracy?</p>
<p>Taken literally, a bureaucracy is just an organization tasked with
ensuring some outcome. In the public sector, OSHA ensures worker safety,
FDA ensures drug safety, EPA ensures environmental protection; in the
private sector, HR ensures legal compliance, IT ensures trade secrets
and data privacy, and so on. Yet even if people agree with the outcome,
they often disagree with the implementation. Bureaucracies have an
endless talent for finding wasteful and ineffective solutions.</p>
<p>Bureaucracies are ineffective due to a lack of accountability. If a
bureaucrat imposes a wasteful policy, what are the consequences? Well,
as long as they are achieving their desired outcome, they are doing
their job, regardless of the pain they inflict on others. They can wield
legal, technical, or financial penalties to force compliance. And
paradoxically, when bureaucrats fail to achieve their desired outcome,
they often get a bigger budget or a bigger stick to wield, rather than
being fired for incompetence. The inability to recognize failure goes
hand in hand with the inability to recognize success: competent and
ambitious people avoid working for bureaucracies because their efforts
go unrewarded. Bureaucracies end up staffed with middling managers, and
we have learned to hate them.</p>
<p>I don’t know how to solve this problem in the public sector, but I
think it’s solvable in the private sector, because there is
theoretically a CEO who is incentivized to maximize the overall
effectiveness of the company; they just need the right tactics. The
solution is simple: <strong>hold bureaucracy accountable by forcing them
to do the actual work</strong>. Let me explain.</p>
<h2 id="bureaucratic-leverage">Bureaucratic leverage</h2>
<p>Bureaucracies usually don’t do any work. This is true in two layered
senses:</p>
<ul>
<li>they don’t accomplish primary objectives; they are in the business
of ensuring secondary objectives.</li>
<li>they don’t do the work of accomplishing the secondary objectives
either; the work is usually pushed onto the same people accomplishing
the primary objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>To give a concrete example: the FDA doesn’t research, develop, or
manufacture the drugs; pharmaceutical companies do. The FDA merely
ensures that the drugs are safe and effective. And in ensuring so, the
FDA doesn’t run the clinical trials; instead, the pharmaceutical
companies are responsible for running the trials at cost, and submitting
the paperwork to the FDA.</p>
<p><strong>Bureaucratic leverage</strong> is defined as the ratio of
work produced for <em>external entities</em> to do, relative to the
amount of work <em>directly done</em> by the bureaucracy. In this
example, the FDA’s 2023 human drugs budget was $2.3 billion dollars <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/166182/download?attachment">(reference)</a>,
while the U.S. clinical trials market was $25 billion dollars <a href="https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/u-s-clinical-trials-industry-is-rising-rapidly-usd-35-1-bn-by-2030/">(reference)</a>.
To a first approximation, the FDA’s human drugs subdivision therefore
has a bureaucratic leverage ratio of 11x.</p>
<p>To give another example, GitHub in 2020 <a href="https://github.com/github/renaming">changed the default git branch
name from <code>master</code> to <code>main</code></a>, a change
intended to promote greater inclusivity of historically and currently
enslaved peoples. I would estimate that roughly 3 person-months of
GitHub’s effort went into considering the impact and implementation
details of this change - a very generous and thoughtful investment into
inclusivity. Yet, the changes imposes a global cost that I would roughly
estimate at ~1 million affected developers * 15 minutes per developer =
~300 person-months of effort, for an approximate bureaucratic leverage
ratio of 100x.</p>
<p>A high bureaucratic leverage ratio is not intrinsically a bad thing.
However, scope insensitivity is a real problem: when a bureaucrat wields
100x leverage, it is a heavy responsibility that is easily
underestimated. There are situations I’ve seen at Google where every
hour of downtime costs the company millions of dollars - and a crack
team of site reliability engineers whose combined hourly wages are tens
of thousands of dollars are desperately working to get it back up. That
is the level of urgency that a 100x leverage ratio <em>should</em>
demand. Does the typical bureaucrat with a 100x leverage ratio behave
with that level of urgency? Absolutely not.</p>
<h2 id="creating-bureaucratic-accountability">Creating bureaucratic
accountability</h2>
<p>“Force bureaucracies do the work” now takes on a more precise
definition: we should hold bureaucracies to a 1x bureaucratic leverage
ratio.</p>
<p>The rationale is simple: it is globally efficient for a bureaucracy
to spend 1 unit of time, if it will reduce everyone else’s workload by
more than 1 unit of time. At this breakeven point, the bureaucracy will
have done roughly 50% of the total work. This rule is not meant to be
taken too literally, since these quantities are difficult to measure
precisely.</p>
<p>From the bureaucrat’s point of view, this means that they have two
budgets to manage: their internal budget, and the external budget for
asking other organizations to do something. Bureaucrats will be
incentivized to reexamine and optimize their external demands. From
everyone else’s perspective, they can be assured that what they’re asked
to do has been priority-sorted - or if it hasn’t been, they can at least
be assured that there’s a limited amount of it they’ll be asked to
do.</p>
<p>The truth is, this external budget has always existed - implicitly -
in the form of compliance. Consider a badly run IT/security department.
They run third-party security scanners on the company’s servers, and
file hundreds of low-value automated tickets with other teams to fix.
They require frequent password changes and relogins. They ban
installation of all non-approved apps and drag their heels on approving
new apps. A few days of “work” can easily generate years of lost
productivity for product teams, if their demands are taken at face
value.</p>
<p>In practice, people have limited tolerance for bullshit; if you flood
their bug tracker with automated security reports, they’ll just bookmark
a custom search page that filters out security reports. If you require
frequent password changes, they’ll use a formulaic password or keep a
password post-it on their monitor. If you drag your heels on approving
apps, they’ll upload the company data to a webapp or run it off a USB
stick. The oft-cited “bullshit umbrella” role of managers is essentially
a rate-limiter on bureaucracy.</p>
<p>On the positive side, centralization of work creates economies of
scale - a topic <a href="https://mitxela.com/essays/codemates/#you-get-a-papercut-you-get-a-papercut-everybody-gets-a-papercut">I’ve
previously discussed in the context of code quality</a>. A bureaucrat
forced to grapple with personally doing a lot of repetitive paperwork
will very quickly decide that some paperwork was never necessary and
will invest in solutions to autofill fields where possible.</p>
<h2 id="embedded-bureaucrats">Embedded bureaucrats</h2>
<p>In a past life as a bureaucrat, my manager asked me to spend my first
three months doing a rotation with a partner team for three months. On
paper it looked like he was just donating his headcount to other teams,
but I was amazed at how many secondary benefits came out of this
rotation program.</p>
<ul>
<li>It made us insiders: by working alongside the partner team, we
became friends and our requests were readily accepted by the partner
team.</li>
<li>We empathized with our partners: since we knew what burden our
requests would create, we could try to avoid wasted effort and respect
our partners’ time.</li>
<li>It made us credible: our partners could see that we were competent
and that they should believe us if we said something was necessary.</li>
<li>It was an advance payment: by giving free resources to the partner
team, we could later ask for at least that much without questions
asked.</li>
</ul>
<p>This rotation arrangement seems like a no-brainer to me, at least
within the company context. Something I don’t understand is why this is
frowned upon as a “revolving door” of corruption in the public sector,
when it is so plainly beneficial in the private sector.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Creating bureaucratic accountability begins with eliminating excuses,
which eventually lets us measure performance, punish poor performance,
and reward excellence. The usual excuse is noncompliance - “we made bad
demands and people ignored/worked around us. If only we had a bigger
stick to enforce compliance, we would have been able to accomplish our
goals.” A bureaucracy with a limited external budget means that people
who find ways to do more with less will be rewarded - the right
alignment of incentives.</p>
