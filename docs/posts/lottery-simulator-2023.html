    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><p>A New Daily Game!</p><p> We built a daily poll game called the <a href="https://pjg1.site/communal-plot-daily-poll">Communal Plot</a>! We hope it&#39;s a fun way to engage with the community and see how your opinions stack up. Check it out and let us know what you think! </p></div></div></div><p> Every so often, a lottery jackpot will get so high that I&#39;ll hear about it on the news or from a friend. When this happens, I immediate start wondering about two things: what I would do with hundreds of millions of dollars and what the odds of winning really are. </p><p> While major lotteries publish some of this information, I wanted to build something that would make it easier to play around with the data in a more exploratory way. With that, here is the PerThirtySix Lottery Simulator! </p><p> This tool is broken up into two sections: Setup and Simulation. The Setup section lets explore probabilities for an existing American lottery or for your own lottery with custom rules. The Simulation section lets you pick some numbers and play up to thousands of tickets per second, and visualizes the returns for you. Note that this tool makes some simplifying assumptions, like that there&#39;s only one jackpot winner and that taxes are ignored. </p></div></div>
