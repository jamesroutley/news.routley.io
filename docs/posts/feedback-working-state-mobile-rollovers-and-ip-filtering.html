    <h1>Feedback: working state, mobile rollovers, and IP filtering</h1>
    
    
<p>
I get questions from people who read my posts and sometimes I answer 
them in a post.  This is one of those times.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
Someone read my
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2025/02/22/war/">&#34;war room&#34;</a>
post and picked up on the part where I spent several weeks trying to get 
to the bottom of what turned out to be &#34;kill -9 -1&#34; nuking the world on 
a bunch of FB machines.  They asked how I keep track of things during 
that time, what my working memory is, and is it paper, text files, IRC 
messages, or just remembering things.
</p>
<p>
The answer is: back when I used to do that kind of thing, I found it 
very useful to have a &#34;MMDD&#34; (hey, I&#39;m in the US, so just pretend it&#39;s 
the back half of an 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">8601</a> number... you&#39;ll 
see why...) directory, and inside of it, I&#39;d have some short names for 
whatever I was dealing with that day.
</p>
<p>
That means today would be 0629, and then something inside of it might be 
&#34;fbar&#34; or &#34;rsw&#34; or &#34;webi&#34; or something.  It was just something to keep 
all of the crap together and yet away from other things I was doing that 
day, while also distinguishing it from other times I might&#39;ve done a 
&#34;fbar&#34; or &#34;webi&#34; or whatever project, if that makes sense.
</p>
<p>
These would just live off my home directory, and yes, it would fill up 
with crap, but I&#39;d batch them up when a year ended.  I&#39;d take 01xx 
through 12xx and move them into &#34;2013&#34; when 2014 began, for instance.
So, as you can see, they *are* ISO-8601 dates, sorta, but it&#39;s 
~/YYYY/MMDD/foobar once it&#39;s old, and it&#39;s merely ~/MMDD/foobar until 
then.  This is a balancing act between speed and having my homedir fill 
up with tons of ancient crap.
</p>
<p>
Any time I needed scratch space for output from things, that&#39;s what I 
used.  That might be the output from a bunch of sweeps over the fleet to 
look for anomalies.  Let&#39;s say I ran a command that sshed into a few 
hundred thousand hosts to look for common items in the logs.  The 
stdout/stderr from that would probably be there so I could hit it up 
multiple times without asking the job runner system for another copy.
It&#39;s a lot faster that way.
</p>
<p>
But in terms of troubleshooting things and dealing with permutations, 
it&#39;s hard to beat paper, and I usually end up with some kind of &#34;lab 
notebook&#34; at any job I work.  I can think of examples of those going 
back over 20 years.  The only problem is that the stuff in them really 
properly belongs to the company so I don&#39;t tend to have them after the 
fact.  A great many pages of context have gone in the shredders over 
time, and not because I didn&#39;t ask.  I&#39;ve asked if anyone wanted them, 
and the answer has always been no.
</p>
<p>
There were also the internal posts about things, and then running 
commentary on IRC channels, but those tend to be useful after the fact, 
or for getting help from other people.  My own state-keeping tends to 
stay on something close at hand and (usually) physically tangible.
</p>
<p>
As for those &lt;date&gt;/&lt;term&gt; directories, some of them turned out to be 
rather handy after the fact.  A lot of times, something would happen, 
and then time would pass, and it would break *again* in exactly the same 
way, and I could think &#34;didn&#39;t we deal with these people already?&#34;, dig 
around, find something from six months earlier, and go &#34;AHA!&#34;.  Now 
armed with the date, I could pull up the right posts, IRC logs, group 
messages, graphs, or whatever else.
</p>
<p>
Considering how much random crap I dealt with in any given day during my 
time &#34;in the barrel&#34; (kids, ask your parents), that was the only way to 
make any sense of it later.  Without stuff like that, by the end of the 
week, I&#39;d have no idea what I had been doing on Monday or Tuesday.  
That&#39;s how bad the load got at points.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
Someone else wrote in and asked if I could do something to improve 
the <a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/fun/counter">overflow calculator</a> 
thing I hacked up last week.  It wasn&#39;t particularly usable on mobile, 
and that&#39;s definitely true.  I wrote it on a laptop and paid exactly 
zero attention to what it would look like on a weirdly small screen 
that&#39;s usually taller than it is wide.
</p>
<p>
It was a fair point, so I took a whack at making it suck slightly less.  
It&#39;s probably still terrible, but in the specific case of me holding my 
phone upright, it looks halfway usable now.  You&#39;re no longer forced 
into &#34;flyspeck-3&#34; mode with the fonts, at least.
</p>
<p>
CSS is such a mess.
</p>
<p>
...
</p>
<p>
I occasionally hear that the site is unreachable from one spot or 
another.  This almost certainly comes down to IP filtering on my part.  
Perhaps you&#39;ve read about the influx of web weasels who are scraping the 
living shit out of everything remotely URL-shaped they can get their 
hands on.  My stuff is certainly in that space, and they show up here 
regularly.
</p>
<p>
Besides that, there are also a number of networks which send nothing but 
straight-up abusive traffic.  This is where you look at the logs and see 
stuff like them using every single IP address in a (v4) /24 to scan for 
random webshit vulnerabilities.  It&#39;s like, nice job, fucko, but I 
don&#39;t run PHP here.  Anyway, that&#39;s pretty solid evidence that a given 
network is not worth hearing from ever again, and so into the filter it 
goes.
</p>
<p>
A whole lot of this happens automatically just based on whatever traffic 
is sent this way first.  Send bad traffic and meet the bit bucket.  I 
don&#39;t even find about most of it since it&#39;s constant and utterly 
uninteresting.
</p>
<p>
Then there are the people who run feed readers which don&#39;t play nicely.  
As 
<a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/12/17/packets/">previously described,</a>
they will get a handful of chances to slow down with 429s, and then if 
the web server feels like those aren&#39;t having an effect, it&#39;ll just 
ignore the traffic for however long it feels like.  Again, I&#39;m also not 
in the loop on this sort of thing.  It&#39;s all automatic.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there is a new rub.  I taught myself how to ingest BGP data, 
and so can now trivially go from an IP address to the autonomous system 
number of whoever&#39;s advertising it, including overlapping 
advertisements (like a /24 out of a bigger /20).  Then I wrote 
something that will dump out an entire AS, and it&#39;s not hard to imagine 
what I do with that.
</p>
<p>
Enough bad behavior from a host -&gt; filter the host.
</p>
<p>
Enough bad hosts in a netblock -&gt; filter the netblock.
</p>
<p>
Enough bad netblocks in an AS -&gt; filter the AS.  Think of it as an &#34;AS 
death penalty&#34;, if you like.
</p>
<p>
As long as clueless network operators continue to let abusive customers 
bounce around thousands of dynamic IP addresses with not so much as a 
hint of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_Whois_Project">SWIP</a> data, those
entire net blocks will find themselves unable to get to large swaths of 
the net.  That&#39;s just how it is, and it&#39;s nothing new.  Send crap, meet 
/dev/null.
</p>
<p>
Dealing with what the web has become is exhausting.
