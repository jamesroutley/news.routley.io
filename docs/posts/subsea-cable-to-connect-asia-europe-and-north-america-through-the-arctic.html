<p>Connectivity across Asia, Europe, and North America will improve and get more route options as Cinia agreed to start a project to build a new subsea cable in the Arctic with Alaskan company Far North Digital.</p>
<p>Cinia and Far North Digital signed Memorandum of Understanding last week to build the subsea cable. The project will enhance Cinia´s already comprehensive connection services even further.</p>
<p>“There is an increasing demand for secure and fast international connectivity with new diverse routes. Spanning three of the world’s largest internet adopting continents the Far North Fiber will be a true global venture”, says Ari-Jussi Knaapila CEO of Cinia.</p>
<p>Cable route study will start in 2022. The system construction period takes about five years to complete and the cable will be in service by the end of 2025.</p>

<h2>Cable brings more options for routes in the Northern hemisphere</h2>
<p>The Cable System is planned to have three seamlessly interlinked segments: the Asian North Pacific segment, the North American Arctic segment, and the European North Atlantic segment.</p>
<p>The joint network will run from Japan, via the Northwest Passage, to Europe with landings in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic. European landings are planned in Norway, Finland and Ireland.</p>
<p>The 14,000 kilometer cable system greatly reduces the optical distance between Asia and Europe, thus minimizing signal latency.</p>
<h2>Cinia network provides high-capacity connections</h2>
<p>Cinia already has a long experience in enabling fast and reliable connectivity services across Europe. Cinia’s 17 000-kilometer optical fiber network and 1200-kilometer C-Lion1 subsea cable to Germany provide direct, high-capacity connections to Europe with the lowest possible latency.</p>
<p>At the same time, Cinia also provides reliable connections to the growing digital services markets in Russia and the Baltic countries through cooperation with Russian operators.</p>
