          <h2>Decentralized verification</h2>
          <p>Biscuit tokens are signed with public key cryptography: any application knowing the public key can verify the token</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h2>Offline attenuation</h2>
          <p>If you hold a valid token, you can generate a new one with less rights, like restricting write access or adding an expiration date</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h2>Datalog policies</h2>
          <p>Authorization policies are written in a logic language. They can be provided by the application, or transported by the token (attenuation)</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h2>Capabilities or Access control lists</h2>
          <p>Biscuit is naturally suited for capabilities based authorization, by carrying a token customized for the request. But you can also provide verification side ACLs as Datalog</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h2>Revocation</h2>
          <p>All tokens come with unique revocation identifiers, that can be used to reject that token and all the tokens attenuated from it</p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
          <h2>Portable</h2>
          <p>Biscuit is implemented in Rust, Haskell, Go, Java, WebAssembly, C... All you need for a new implementation is a Protobuf generator and Ed25519 signing. The specification comes with a list of predefined test cases</p>
