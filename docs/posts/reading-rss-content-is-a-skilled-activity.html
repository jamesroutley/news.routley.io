    <h1>Reading RSS content is a skilled activity</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-mdx-content="true"><p>Shit&#39;s gotten weird out there. The internet has devolved from something that was mostly quirky and altruistic to something that, in many ways, is straight-up evil. Companies have commoditized user attention through an economic framework that is completely divorced from the user&#39;s experience: Advertisers go to some ad platform, set up a few tags, and third parties shill for them without knowing anything about advertiser or user. The user&#39;s experience is determined by some algorithm whose sole purpose is to increase engagement, so the effects on the user are harmful and unknown, and advertisers don&#39;t care.</p>
<p>Enter RSS: An opportunity to reclaim your attention through simple and open tech. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve bailed on all of my attempts at using RSS readers up to this point because there&#39;s simply too much content to sift through. But, I&#39;m finally realizing what was right in front of my face: The experience of using an RSS reader <em>is</em> and <em>should be</em> characteristically different than using other forms of social media. With an RSS reader, you decide what you see; in order to <em>decide</em> you must start with something <em>undecided</em> meaning <em>unfiltered</em>.</p>
<p>So, how do we decide and filter for ourselves? My favored approach is fairly old fashioned: Chains of trust. We start by finding someone whose <em>judgement</em> we trust and subscribing to their feed, and then we find out who they trust and subscribe to their feed, and so on. Part of the <em>judgement</em> that we&#39;re looking for in these trustees is not simply whether or not content is <em>accurate</em> but whether or not it is worth our <em>attention</em>. Over time, we can curate our little garden of content, make it diverse, and eliminate unnecessary noise. But, much like a real garden, pruning and weeding is essential and intentional. So, using an RSS reader is more than having a nice aggregator: It&#39;s a skill and a routine. And that&#39;s also where the magic lies because it&#39;s that very process of engaging with content and deciding whether or not it has value to you that makes using an RSS reader a better experience and one where you own your attention.</p></div></div>
