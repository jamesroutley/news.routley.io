    <h1>ProtonMail Rewrites Your Emails</h1>

<p>I switched to ProtonMail a few years back after getting fed up with Google. It’s been mostly acceptable, but a few months ago the Android client started mangling emails – if I hit “send” too soon, it would send out only part of what I’d typed; I had to wait 10 seconds or so after I finished typing before hitting send to be sure it sent. I figured I’d switch to some other email client instead, since I wasn’t particularly in love with the Proton app anyway.</p>

<p>My solution was to set up the <a href="https://proton.me/mail/bridge">Proton Bridge</a> in a VM on my NAS, then used rinetd to forward incoming connections on the IMAP and SMTP ports to the bridge (which only listens on 127.0.0.1). I then set up tailscale on that box and on my phone; with that, I could connect any Android email client (I like <a href="https://email.faircode.eu/">FairEmail</a>) to my Proton account. I was also accessing it from Linux using Claws.</p>

<p>Everything was great until I decided the other day that I’d <em>also</em> like to do PGP signing on my outgoing messages. I exported a signing-only subkey to my Android device and configured FairEmail+OpenKeyring to use it, then I also set up Claws on Linux for PGP/MIME.</p>

<p>When I sent a test message to myself, though, Claws and FairEmail didn’t have any clue that it was signed. If I switched to PGP inline, it worked. I sent an email to one of the Claws maintainers, who reported that my MIME structure was all messed up. He sent me a signed message back, and Claws was able to verify the signature just fine.</p>

<p>It turns out that Proton has been breaking outgoing PGP signatures from the beginning: <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/26">https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/26</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/320">https://github.com/ProtonMail/proton-bridge/issues/320</a>. It seems that their argument is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you send a regular email via Proton to another Proton client, they automatically PGP sign+encrypt the message. (I think this is great!)</li>
<li>Their automatic signing+encryption cannot coexist with a user-applied signature.</li>
<li>Therefore, all user-applied signatures will be broken. Tough luck, bucko, we’re the SECURE email company, you’ll upload your private key to our servers and you’ll like it!</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s absurd that there’s no way to disable this, no option to tell Proton “if you see a multipart/signed or multipart/encrypted message, just leave it the hell alone.”</p>

<p>I’m looking at other potential email hosts. I know PGP isn’t widely used, but I have a hard time swallowing Proton’s silent mangling of my email, and I especially dislike their smarmy we-know-better attitude when people complain about it.</p>
