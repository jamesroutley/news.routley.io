<p>Being swamped â€” overwhelmed by stuff to do â€” is the default state of being within a startup. Thereâ€™s always more to do than time to do it, and the list keeps growing.</p>

<p>Everyone else working at every other startup feels this too. Even if it doesnâ€™t look that way from the outside. (And it often doesnâ€™t.)</p>

<p>I used to think being swamped was a good sign. Iâ€™m doing stuff! Iâ€™m making progress! Iâ€™m important! I have an excuse to make others wait! Then I realized being swamped just means Iâ€™m stuck in the default state, like a ball that settled to a stop in the deepest part of an empty pool, the spot where rainwater has collected into a puddle.</p>

<p>Being swamped means probably not getting enough rest, making things <a href="https://www.gkogan.co/blog/simple-systems/">more complicated than they need to be</a>, wasting time on petty decisions, and not thinking deeply about important decisions.</p>

<p>Now, Iâ€™m impressed by people who are <em>not</em> swamped. They prioritize ruthlessly to separate whatâ€™s most important from everything else, think deeply about those most-important things, execute them well to make a big impact, do that consistently, and get others around them to do the same. Damn, thatâ€™s impressive!</p>

<p>Being swamped isnâ€™t a badge of honor, itâ€™s something to work on.</p>
