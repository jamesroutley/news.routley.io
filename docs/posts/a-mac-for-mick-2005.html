    <p>The last couple of weeks before the Macintosh unveiling on January 24th were extremely hectic.  The software still wasn&#39;t finished, and it wasn&#39;t clear if there was enough time left to get it into adequate shape.  Meanwhile, the Apple PR machine was revved up to full speed, so there were also plenty of unusual diversions, like being interviewed and photographed for the national press.</p></div>
