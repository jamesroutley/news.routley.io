In this paper, we identify and characterize artifacts in feature maps of both supervised and self-supervised ViT networks. The artifacts correspond to high-norm tokens appearing during inference primarily in low-informative background areas of images, that are repurposed for internal computations. We propose a simple yet effective solution based on providing additional tokens to the input sequence of the Vision Transformer to fill that role. We show that this solution fixes that problem entirely for both supervised and self-supervised models, sets a new state of the art for self-supervised visual models on dense visual prediction tasks, enables object discovery methods with larger models, and most importantly leads to smoother feature maps and attention maps for downstream visual processing.</span></p><p><strong>Anonymous Url<!-- -->:</strong> <span>I certify that there is no URL (e.g., github page) that could be used to find authors&#39; identity.</span></p><p><strong>No Acknowledgement Section<!-- -->:</strong> <span>I certify that there is no acknowledgement section in this submission for double blind review.</span></p><p><strong>Primary Area<!-- -->:</strong> <span>unsupervised, self-supervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning</span></p><p><strong>Submission Number<!-- -->:</strong> <span>3647</span></p></div></div>
