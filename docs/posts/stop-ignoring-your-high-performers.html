    <h1>Stop Ignoring Your High Performers</h1>

In doing so, though, these high performers are often left feeling overlooked and neglected. Contrary to popular belief, high performers need just as much attention as underperformers — just not in the same way. Rather than being disregarded for their productivity, high performers need recognition and appreciation, opportunities for growth and challenge, clear pathways for advancement, autonomy and trust, and a feeling of purpose and belonging in the organization.</p></span></section></div><p data-first-paragraph="true">In every organization, high performers are the driving force<b> </b>behind innovation, productivity, and excellence. They consistently exceed expectations, push boundaries, and inspire those around them. Yet, despite their critical importance to an organization’s mission and bottom line, high performers, who are generally <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-6570.2011.01239.x">400%</a> more productive than an average employee (and as high as <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/attracting-and-retaining-the-right-talent">800% more productive</a> in highly complex occupations, such as software developers), are often overlooked. Instead, managers focus on under-performers who demand immediate intervention. This unbalanced attention is costly, leading to disengagement, frustration, and ultimately, the loss of top talent.</p></div></article></div>
