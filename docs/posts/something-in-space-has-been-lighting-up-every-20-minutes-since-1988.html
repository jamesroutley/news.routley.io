<p>On Wednesday, researchers announced the discovery of a new astronomical enigma. The new object, GPM J1839–10, behaves a bit like a pulsar, sending out regular bursts of radio energy. But the physics that drives pulsars means that they&#39;d stop emitting if they slowed down too much, and almost every pulsar we know of blinks at least once per minute.</p>
<p>GPM J1839–10 takes 22 minutes between pulses. We have no idea what kind of physics or what kind of objects can power that.</p>
<h2>A persistent transient</h2>
<p>GPM J1839–10 was discovered in a search of the galactic plane for transient objects—something that&#39;s not there when you first look, but appears the next time you check. The typical explanation for a transient object is something like a supernova, where a major event gives something an immense boost in brightness. They&#39;re found at the radio end of the spectrum, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/11/its-coming-from-inside-the-galaxy-first-fast-radio-burst-source-idd/">fast radio bursts</a>, but are also very brief and, so, fairly difficult to spot.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In any case, GPM J1839–10 showed up in the search in a rather unusual way: It showed up as a transient item twice in the same night of observation. Rather than delivering a short burst of immense energy, such as a fast radio burst, GPM J1839–10 was much lower energy and spread out over a 30-second-long burst.</p>
<p>Follow-on observations showed that the object repeated pretty regularly, with a periodicity of about 1,320 seconds (more commonly known as 22 minutes). There&#39;s a window of about 400 seconds centered on that periodicity, and a burst can appear anywhere within the window and will last anywhere from 30 to 300 seconds. While active, the intensity of GPM J1839–10 can vary, with lots of sub-bursts within the main signal. Occasionally, a window will also go by without any bursts.</p>
<p>A search through archival data showed that signals had been detected at the site as far back as 1988. So, whatever is producing this signal is not really a transient, in the sense that the phenomenon that&#39;s producing these bursts isn&#39;t a one-time-only event.</p>
<p>The list of known objects that can produce this sort of behavior is short and consists of precisely zero items.</p>
