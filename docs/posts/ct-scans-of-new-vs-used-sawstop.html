It operates by running an electrical current through the saw blade, which is continuously monitored by the brake cartridge. When the blade comes into contact with skin, the electrical signal is disrupted, triggering the brake mechanism. In less than 5 milliseconds—faster than a car airbag—the actuator assembly unleashes the aluminum pawl and halts the blade spinning at 3,500 RPM. The saw blade teeth bite into it, and the blade’s momentum causes it to retract under the table to prevent further injury.</p><p>Take the 3D reconstruction of the new SawStop for a spin in the Voyager window below. You can toggle between 3D and 2D views by clicking the <strong>3D ▼</strong> button in the upper right corner of the window. From there, you can scrub through the X, Y, and Z axes of the SawStop.
