    <h1>Using the ZBar barcode scanning suite in the browser with WebAssembly</h1>

<h2 id="goal">Goal</h2>
<p>So I wanted to make a cross-platform barcode scanner for a research project involving inventory management. Ideally, it would end up being a simple library that could be used in the browser of a mid-tier smartphone. Some constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>the scanner needed to be able to recognize multiple barcodes in one camera frame</li>
<li>It would need to work with QR-codes, but also with the older, even more widespread one-dimensional barcodes (EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, etc.), ideally using the same codebase and without user configuration.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="meet-zbar">Meet ZBar</h2>
<p>To meet the requirements mentioned above, I looked at several Javascript libraries. There were several obvious contenders:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/">QuaggaJs</a>
<ul>
<li>a very nice barcode scanner, however doesn’t do QR-codes out of the box.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cozmo/jsQR">jsQR</a>
<ul>
<li>Performant, pure JS QR-code scanner with a easy to use API. Only scans QR-codes (and only one per image?).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/schmich/instascan">Instascan</a>
<ul>
<li>Nice <em>Promise</em>-based API, but only scans QR-codes. Powered by an Emscripten port of <a href="https://github.com/zxing/zxing">ZXing</a>, so should theoretically be able to handle multiple 1D code formats with some hacking. However, this is not enabled by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When broadening my search for libraries by relaxing the ‘Javascript-only’ constraint, I quickly stumbled across <a href="https://github.com/ZBar/ZBar">ZBar</a>, a battle-tested C library that is widely used for barcode scanning. It can work with multiple types of 1D and 2D (QR) barcodes and can detect multiple codes in a single frame.</p>
<p>Considering the fact that ZBar is a C library, I quickly found that some people had already been working on compiling it to Javascript for use in the browser. <a href="https://github.com/yurydelendik/zbarjs">ZBarjs</a> is a nice example, albeit scarcely documented. ZBarjs uses the amazing <a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/">emscripten</a> compiler to compile the LLVM bitcode derived from ZBar’s C-code to <a href="http://asmjs.org/">asm.js</a>, a <em>subset</em> of Javascript aimed at improved performance.</p>
<p>Obviously, this being a ‘research’ project I figured I couldn’t just leave it at that. Why would I skip out of overengineering something with a new awesome technology?</p>
<p>Meet WebAssembly.</p>
<h2 id="webassembly">WebAssembly</h2>
<p>WebAssembly is <a href="https://webassembly.org/">new</a> and <em>very</em> shiny. WebAssembly is a low-level language for the browser that can be used as a compile target for LLVM languages ike C, C++, Rust, but also for example for TypeScript (using <a href="https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript">Assemblyscript/Binaryen</a>), all the while promising near-native execution performance. All major browsers <a href="https://webassembly.org/roadmap/">recently started supporting it</a>.</p>
<p>I think the most awesome thing about WebAssembly is that it has the potential to make web development less dependent on Javascript, opening the realm of the browser up to the vast expertise and time-tested libraries of the languages in the LLVM ecosystem.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/02/what-makes-webassembly-fast/">here</a> for an interesting series of posts by Mozilla on WebAssembly and its potential.</p>
<h2 id="using-zbar-in-webassembly">Using ZBar in WebAssembly</h2>
<p>The need to use ZBar in the browser is a <em>great</em> excuse to try out WebAssembly and explore the nascent ecosystem surrounding it. Moreover, I might just be able to get some performance gains over using the asm.js version of ZBar (I will not go into any performance benchmarks in this post, maybe later).</p>
<p>Compiling a C function that uses ZBar to detect barcodes to a WebAssembly module is only slightly more complicated than compiling to asm.js, thanks to the magic of Emscripten.</p>
<p>Note that Emscripten also generates the JS/WebAssembly boilerplate needed to interface with your WebAssembly code. This makes Emscripten so much more than a simple C -&gt; WebAssembly compiler.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-our-development-environment">Setting up our development environment</h2>
<p>We need to have emscripten (<code>emcc</code>) available on our system. You can install emscripten locally by following <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/C_to_wasm">these instructions</a>, or, if you feel more like using a fast-food solution like I did at the time: use a Docker container as your build environment. I found <code>trzeci/emscripten</code> to be easy to use for this purpose.</p>
<p>Spin up the container, mount your local working directory as a volume (reachable at <code>src</code>) and enter a bash shell:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash">docker run -v <span>$(</span>pwd<span>)</span>:/src -it trzeci/emscripten:1.39.0 /bin/bash
</code></pre></div><p>Before compiling ZBar, we need to quickly install some build dependencies. As I had to compile ZBar just once, I did not care that these installs would not be persisted.</p>
<p>In the <code>trzeci/emscripten</code> shell, run:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash">apt-get update <span>&amp;&amp;</span> apt-get install autoconf libtool gettext autogen imagemagick libmagickcore-dev -y
</code></pre></div><p>Then we can finally start compiling ZBar from source (instructions partly adapted <a href="https://github.com/yurydelendik/zbarjs">from zbarjs</a>).</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span># cd into the mounted host directory</span>
cd /src

<span># clone the latest ZBar code from the Github repo</span>
git clone https://github.com/ZBar/ZBar

<span># cd into the directory</span>
cd ZBar

<span># Delete all -Werror strings from configure.ac</span>
<span># Don&#39;t treat warnings as errors!</span>
sed -i <span>&#34;s/ -Werror//&#34;</span> <span>$(</span>pwd<span>)</span>/configure.ac

<span># Generate automake files</span>
autoreconf -i

<span># Configure: disable all unneccesary features</span>
<span># This may produce red error messages, but it is safe to ignore them (it assumes that</span>
<span># emscripten is GCC and uses invalid parameters on it)</span>
emconfigure ./configure --without-x --without-jpeg --without-imagemagick --without-npapi --without-gtk --without-python --without-qt --without-xshm --disable-video --disable-pthread

<span># Compile ZBar</span>
emmake make
</code></pre></div><p>That should do the trick and leave you with a compiled library. Note that you should <strong>keep this container shell alive</strong>, as we will need it later.</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-c-code-to-detect-barcodes-with">Writing the C code to detect barcodes with</h2>
<p>Lets write the C code that uses the ZBar library to detect barcodes in an image. We want to call these functions from the browser’s javascript environment later. The C-file, called <code>scan.c</code>, looks like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</span><span>

</code></pre></div><p>Several things to note about this code:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE</code> macro ensures that the functions are not eliminated by the compiler, as they are technically dead code (i.e. are not reachable from something like a <code>main()</code> function).</li>
<li>We mark the <code>js_output_result</code> function as an external symbol with <code>extern</code>. This function will be defined in the javascript glue code, and the Emscripten compiler will splice in a reference to this function at link time.</li>
<li>There is plenty of room for optimizations, like re-using the scanner across multiple images. Let’s not go into these now.</li>
<li>This code showcases just one combination of methods to get data in and out of the WebAssembly environment from the browser JS environment. Several alternative methods can be found in the <a href="https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/index.html">Emscripten documentation.</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-javascript-glue-code">The Javascript ‘glue’ code</h2>
<p>We’ll also create a file called <code>library.js</code>, in which we define the javascript functions that should be callable from the WebAssembly environment. Emscripten takes care of the nasty bits for us. If you want to read more, check out the <a href="https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/porting/connecting_cpp_and_javascript/Interacting-with-code.html#implement-a-c-api-in-javascript">emscripten docs on this topic</a>. Note that in the below code, the <code>Module</code> and <code>LibraryManager</code> objects, along with the <code>mergeInto</code> function, are globals provided by Emscripten.</p>
<p>We define a single function: the one we use to extract data about the detected barcodes with. Important to note: before this function is called, a function should be set on the <code>processResult</code> key of the <code>Module</code> object. This is not a super elegant way to interface with your own code, but it suffices for now.</p>
<p>Our <code>library.js</code> file contains:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="javascript"><span>mergeInto</span>(<span>LibraryManager</span>.<span>library</span>, {
    <span>js_output_result</span><span>:</span> <span>function</span> (<span>symbol</span>, <span>data</span>, <span>polygon</span>, <span>polygon_size</span>) {

</code></pre></div><h2 id="compiling-our-code-to-a-webassembly-module">Compiling our code to a WebAssembly module</h2>
<p>From your build container shell (<code>trzeci/emscripten</code>, see above) run the following command:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>A quick rundown of this command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>emcc</code> calls emscripten</li>
<li>The <code>-O3</code> flag tells the compiler to produce highly optimized WebAssembly and Javascript code.</li>
<li><code>-s WASM=1</code> tells <code>emcc</code> to produce WebAssembly</li>
<li><code>—js-library</code> tells emscripten where it can find your Javascript glue code</li>
<li><code>-s EXTRA_EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS</code> tells Emscripten to inject the <code>Module</code> global in the javascript environment with these two utility functions. <code>crwap</code> allows us to call our C functions and <code>Pointer_stringify</code> will help with moving data from the WebAssembly runtime to JS.</li>
<li><code>-I</code> tells it which C libs/code to compile</li>
</ul>
<p>This should produce the following files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a.out.js</code>, containing the nicely packaged javascript glue code (thanks emscripten!)</li>
<li><code>a.out.wasm</code> containing the WebAssembly module</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing-our-barcode-scanner">Testing our barcode scanner</h2>
<p>To test our barcode scanning module, lets write a simple <code>index.html</code> that opens up a webcam feed and passes image frames to our scanner module and, when a barcode is found, draws its bounding box and the barcode content to a canvas.</p>
<p>Note that I also included a step for converting the image data to grayscale using a quick bit shifting hack. I expect that this operation can be implemented in a more performant way with WebAssembly, but lets not worry about this right now.</p>
<p>You are going to need to run a quick ad-hoc static file server to run test everything in your browser. I am a big fan of the minimalist tool <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve">serve</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> make sure your webserver sets the <code>Content-Type</code> header for the <code>.wasm</code> file correctly. Firefox 58 apparently follows this part of the WebAssembly spec to the letter and will refuse to compile the .<code>wasm</code> file, causing the Emscripten glue to fall back to a slow polyfill. The latest version of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve">serve</a> handles this properly.</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>There we have it, we compiled some C code that uses ZBar to WebAssembly, wrote some Javascript glue code, and ended up with a nice in-browser barcode scanner. Thanks to ZBar, our scanner is compatible with a wide range of barcode types and can detect multiple codes in a single image frame.</p>
<p>Some things need work, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance is not fantastic yet. There are a few really obvious optimizations that can be applied, though, and I may go into optimizing the scanner in a next post. In short, I would first look at:
<ul>
<li>better memory management at the WebAssembly level (destruction of the buffers, re-using the scanner.)</li>
<li>In a more complex application, I would definitely offload as much work as possible (e.g. the WebAssembly/JS interop) to a web worker.</li>
<li>Feeding of webcam frames to the WebAssembly heap can be optimzed. First rendering each frame to a canvas seems convoluted, but I haven’t really quantified this overhead. Currently this is the only way I know of…</li>
<li>Try all (combinations of) compiler optimizations. Emscripten features a <a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/optimizing/Optimizing-Code.html">pretty serious collection of compiler optimizations</a> at various levels.</li>
<li>Reducing the resolution of the input images vastly improves performance. I would like to know what kind of impact this has on the distance at which QR codes can be detected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The scanner requires barcodes to have a pretty high resolution before it can detect them. This limits detection to barcodes that are near the camera. I don’t necessarily expect other implementations to outperform ours on this point, as I think we are running into the base resolution requirements of confident QR-code detection. There may be some knobs inside ZBar that can be turned to reduce the resolution requirement by sacrificing decoding fidelity, but I didn’t have the time to look into that yet.</li>
<li>Even with the help of Emscripten, the interoperability between Javascript and WebAssembly still has quite a bit of a learning curve to it. However, I expect a lot of nice abstraction layers to be developed as the technology matures.</li>
<li>In the future, <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/host-bindings/blob/master/proposals/host-bindings/Overview.md">access to DOM APIs from WebAssembly</a> may obviate the need for performance critical interactions with Javascript glue code. That would be a game changer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion, this project was a great way to explore the basics of using WebAssembly. Moreover, it showed a glimpse of a future in which we can use WebAssembly to leverage the huge ecosystem of C (and other LLVM languages) to build richer and more performant applications for the web.</p>
