    <h1>Show HN: AsteroidOS 2.0 – Nobody asked, we shipped anyway</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p>Asteroids travel steadily, occasionally leaving observable distance. It has been a while since our last release, and now it&#39;s finally here!</p>
<p>AsteroidOS 2.0 has arrived, bringing major features and improvements gathered during its journey through community space. Always-on-Display, expanded support for more watches, new launcher styles, customizable quick settings, significant performance increases in parts of the User Interface, and enhancements to our synchronization clients are just some highlights of what to expect.</p>

<h2>Expanded Watch Support<span id="asteroidos-20-has-landed-expanded-watch-support"></span>
<a href="#asteroidos-20-has-landed-expanded-watch-support" name="asteroidos-20-has-landed-expanded-watch-support"></a></h2>
<p>Since 1.0 we added support for the following watches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fossil Gen 4 Watches (firefish/ray)</li>
<li>Fossil Gen 5 Watches (triggerfish)</li>
<li>Fossil Gen 6 Watches (hoki)</li>
<li>Huawei Watch (sturgeon)</li>
<li>Huawei Watch 2 (sawfish/sawshark)</li>
<li>LG Watch W7 (narwhal)</li>
<li>Moto 360 2015 (smelt)</li>
<li>MTK6580 (harmony/inharmony)</li>
<li>OPPO Watch (beluga)</li>
<li>Polar M600 (pike)</li>
<li>Ticwatch C2+ &amp; C2 (skipjack)</li>
<li>Ticwatch E &amp; S (mooneye)</li>
<li>Ticwatch E2 &amp; S2 (tunny)</li>
<li>Ticwatch Pro, Pro 2020 and LTE (catfish/catfish-ext/catshark)</li>
<li>Ticwatch Pro 3 (rover/rubyfish)</li>
</ul>
<p>And partial support for the following watches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Casio WSD-F10/F20 (koi, ayu) - bricking have been reported on some watches</li>
<li>LG Watch Urbane 2 (nemo) - missing too many features</li>
<li>Moto 360 1st gen (minnow) - has underwhelming performance, it is the only watch we have ported with a TI SoC.</li>
<li>Samsung Gear 2 (rinato) - too unstable and too bad power management</li>
<li>Samsung Gear Live (sprat) - in an unusable state due to persistent display issues</li>
</ul>
<p>We have created an &#34;Experimental&#34; category in our watch gallery for the above 5 watches since we do not consider those suitable for daily use. We will however continue to provide install images for these watches, and we welcome new contributors with fresh ideas to help improve support! We also continue to monitor supported watches and for example recently demoted the Sony Smartwatch 3 (tetra) due to unresolved hardware support issues.</p>
<p>The Samsung Gear 2 (rinato) is our first watch supported with a mainline Linux kernel and therefore without the use of libhybris. The Asus Zenwatch 2 (sparrow) also has very basic support for running on a mainline Linux kernel.</p>
<p>For a complete list of supported devices and installation instructions, please visit our <a href="https://asteroidos.org/install/">installation guide</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from adding new watches, the community has also been actively enhancing the support for our existing range of watches.
Visit our newly created <a href="https://asteroidos.org/install/features/">feature matrix page</a> to find out about the detailed support level for your watch.</p>

<a href="#asteroidos-20-has-landed-community-contributions" name="asteroidos-20-has-landed-community-contributions"></a></h2>
<p>This release would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of our community contributors. We extend our heartfelt thanks to everyone who reported issues, submitted patches, and provided feedback during the development cycle.</p>
<p>Over the years, the AsteroidOS community has expanded its reach, with community translators adding over 20 languages to the <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/asteroidos/#languages">AsteroidOS Weblate</a>. Translating into your local language is the easiest way to get involved. Your help is most valuable to make AsteroidOS fit for use in your region.</p>
<p>Watchface creation has been a popular community activity lately. We are happy to present the new and comprehensive <a href="https://asteroidos.org/wiki/watchfaces-creation/">watchfaces creation and design guide</a>. It is garnished with testing and deployment scripts to simplify the process further. 
Our community came up with funny and beautiful new watchfaces. Those are all collected in the <a href="https://github.com/AsteroidOS/unofficial-watchfaces">unofficial watchfaces repository</a>.</p>
<p>moWerk has contributed a variety of watchfaces. Two highlights are the minimalistic <a href="https://youtu.be/cXeWRX6N6Sg">pulsedot</a> and a classic Monty Python inspired <a href="https://twitter.com/eLtMosen/status/1403642123338014722">silly walks watchface</a>.</p>
<p>MagneFire did show-off <a href="https://twitter.com/MagneFire_/status/1230159641004445696">Doom</a>, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@MagneFire/107105850296484856">Super Tux Kart</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MagneFire_/status/1220789841673236485">gpSP</a> and other <a href="https://twitter.com/MagneFire_/status/1353443545831510016">emulated games</a> on his watch. The native 2048 port called diamonds was recently included into the stock set of apps.</p>
<p>Dodoradio worked on a few unusual watches, like the <a href="https://asteroidos.org/install/narwhal/">LG Watch W7</a> with its physical hands to be taken into account. And the <a href="https://github.com/AsteroidOS/meta-smartwatch/pull/140">Casio WSD-FXX series</a> sporting multifunctional secondary displays. Along with some more conventional ports such as the Fossil Gen5 and Polar M600. For watches with GPS, he contributed a <a href="https://git.dodorad.io/dodoradio/asteroid-map/about">Map app with waypoint functionality</a> to the community repository. His initial version of the often requested <a href="https://git.dodorad.io/dodoradio/asteroid-health">asteroid-health</a> app is already capable of automatically tracking steps and heartrate with minimal impact on battery life.</p>
<p>Beroset implemented the new <a href="https://asteroidos.org/news/nightstand/index.html">Nightstand mode</a>. In addition to his efforts in maintaining the build tools, Beroset has also developed <a href="https://github.com/beroset/asteroid-hosttools">host-tools</a> which make it easier to work on watches from a Linux host. Furthermore, he has included a user-friendly <a href="https://wiki.asteroidos.org/index.php/Watchface_and_Package_Installation#Scripted_method">GUI for deploying watchfaces</a> and created <a href="https://github.com/beroset/asteroid-weatherfetch">asteroid-weatherfetch</a>, a convenient app that downloads weather data using the watches <a href="https://wiki.asteroidos.org/index.php/IP_Connection">IP connection</a>.</p>
<p>PostmarketOS now offers our launcher and core apps, thanks to postmarketOS developer PureTryOut, who moved our buildsystem from qmake to cmake along the way.</p>
<p>The program <a href="https://github.com/AsteroidOS/lcd-tools">lcd-tools</a> by lecris and MagneFire was originally developed to control the secondary LCD on the TicWatch Pro. And got extended by dodoradio and beroset to make use of many more features the Casio secondary displays offer.</p>
<p>MagneFire, jrt, moWerk and beroset joined the AsteroidOS team.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure<span id="asteroidos-20-has-landed-infrastructure"></span>
<a href="#asteroidos-20-has-landed-infrastructure" name="asteroidos-20-has-landed-infrastructure"></a></h2>
<p>Our website <a href="https://asteroidos.org">asteroidos.org</a> has seen a major content extension.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://asteroidos.org/faq/">FAQ</a> section has been added to provide a quick overview of our project.</li>
<li>The Install page has grown into a gallery of supported watches over time with now 30 watches listed. We renamed it to &#34;<a href="https://asteroidos.org/watches/">Watches</a>&#34; and plan to evolve this page into a purchase guide to aid new users in choosing a supported watch. A first step was to resize the images of all watches to correctly reflect the relative size differences between them, to be able to compare their dimensions.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://asteroidos.org/wiki/documentation/">Documentation</a> pages are frequently updated by community members and nicely keep up with the current state of development. We recently moved them into a MediaWiki. This enables users without deeper knowledge to contribute to the documentation much more easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>The creator of the unofficial <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AsteroidOS/">Subreddit</a> gave us full access, making it an official channel alongside our <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@AsteroidOS">Mastodon account</a>.</p>
<p>As we already mentioned in a <a href="https://asteroidos.org/news/farewell-freenode">previous blog post</a>, we moved all our communication from freenode to Matrix and Libera.chat. You are invited to join the AsteroidOS Matrix channel using this link. <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#Asteroid:matrix.org">https://matrix.to/#/#Asteroid:matrix.org</a></p>
<p>With 2.0 we introduce a community repository, to improve discoverability and simplify the installation of precompiled packages, while building the foundation for a possible graphical software center in the future. Currently, the repository consists of a few debugging tools, community watchfaces, games and emulators. Developers are welcome to create pull requests on the <a href="https://github.com/AsteroidOS/meta-asteroid-community">meta-community</a> repo for packaging.</p>
<p>After moving our infrastructure to a larger server, we have seen an increase in the frequency of nightly releases. However, it is worth noting that completely rebuilding all packages for all 30 watch system images still takes almost a week. Therefore, we can expect the nightlies to be ready on weekends. </p>

<h2>The Future<span id="asteroidos-20-has-landed-the-future"></span>
<a href="#asteroidos-20-has-landed-the-future" name="asteroidos-20-has-landed-the-future"></a></h2>
<p>As you might have noticed, the current releases linked on the installation pages have feature parity with the 2.0 release. At some point, we decided to switch from our stable 1.0 release to a quasi 1.1 nightly rolling release, as the 1.0 release became too old to maintain. In the future, we would like to change our release cycle to offer more frequent stable releases. A stable release will always be stable. But not too old to no longer be maintainable.</p>
<p>For the future, we are going to set up a roadmap for features we would like to see in an eventual next release.
Based on recent early community work, we might see features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Combined fitness app (Privacy minded heart rate monitoring and step counter tracking)</li>
<li>WiFi setup via the settings app</li>
<li>Web based Watchface creation tool</li>
<li>Web based flash tool</li>
<li>App store for making community contributions easily available</li>
</ul>
