<p>It’s Saturday, March 5th 2022 and I can’t help myself, so here’s an edited and revised version of an imaginary conversation I had earlier this week<sup id="fnref:week"><a href="#fn:week">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
<hr/>

<p><em>About ten years ago:</em></p>
<p>bank: hey, you can get digital statements now, wanna go paperless?</p>
<p>you: hey awesome great</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Years pass:</em></p>
<p>you: hm, I need that statement from 2016</p>
<p>bank: we deleted it</p>
<p>you: are you fucking kidding me</p>
<p>bank: yeah we deleted it</p>
<p>you: you… you deleted the statement from 2016</p>
<p>bank: uh huh yep</p>
<p>you: but it was a digital statement</p>
<p>bank: so?</p>
<p>you: it was a pdf</p>
<p>bank: and?</p>
<p>you: but I still need it</p>
<p>bank: ok well let us think about it–</p>
<p>you: you put me on fucking hold</p>
<p>bank: ok we got you</p>
<p>you: this better be good</p>
<p>bank: ok, send us a letter or call up our call center but not our regular call center, a special call center, and we’ll send you a copy in the mail and maybe charge you for it, and it’ll arrive whenever, you know. hope it’s not urgent</p>
<p>you: fucking computers and fucking businesses</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Time passes. Later, but also maybe just the next day:</em></p>
<p>you: hey bank, I wanna pay someone</p>
<p>bank: awesome! we love paying someone. have you tried using our new bill pay feature?</p>
<p>you: I guess? Is it some new third party service you use that half works?</p>
<p>bank: try our new bill pay feature!</p>
<p>you: ok, I guess I’ll try your new bill pay feature</p>
<p>Tries to make a payment. It fails.</p>
<p>you: well that didn’t work</p>
<p><em>While trying to make a payment again</em></p>
<p>you: ok, still not working. way to completely meet my already low expectations, bank.</p>
<p><em>While trying to fuzz the payment amount (Fuzzing a payment amount would be trying different payment amounts to see if the failure is related to the input provided):</em></p>
<p>you: ok got it, there’s an undeclared, private limit to the amount you can trans-</p>
<p>bank: we’ve frozen your bill pay feature, please call customer service</p>
<p>you: fffffffff</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Shortly, while calling customer service:</em></p>
<p>you: hi, is this bank customer service?</p>
<p>customer service agent: no, this is not bank customer service, this is third party bill pay service that bank uses but you can totally trust us</p>
<p>you: of course it is</p>
<p>customer service agent: what can we help you with?</p>
<p>you: well firstly it’s your terrible business processes and how you’ve implemented them in software and the design of those workflows which clearly have never gone through any appreciable user testing and instead have implemented, by checkbox, “is it technically possible, if someone spends enough time, and understands the arcane uncommunicated rules, for someone to arrange the transfer of money from one account, to another”, and also your content design of course, an-</p>
<p>customer service agent: sir, this isn’t a wendy’s you want the other thread</p>
<p>you: ok I tried to make a payment and I assume I hit a limit you never told me about, please change it</p>
<p>customer service agent: ok great to raise your limit you need to talk to your bank</p>
<p>you: of course I do</p>
<p>yes, I can’t do that for you, you need to talk to your bank</p>
<p>you: you do know your bill pay service gave me this number to call</p>
<p><em>A pause for a long, painful sigh:</em></p>
<p>you: yes of course I need to call my fucking bank. I’m sorry. I’m not mad at you. It’s just that all of us have so little agency in this world now. It’s exhausting. Would you like to join me in screaming at the voi-</p>
<p>customer service agent: would you be able to participate in a customer satisfaction survey to provide feedback on how we did after this call?</p>
<p>you: if I don’t give you a good rating in this survey will you get fired?</p>
<p>customer service agent: yes</p>
<p>you: ok yes, I will participate in a customer satisfaction survey to provide feedback on how you did after this call and also fuck your employer and fuck how business works</p>
<p>customer service agent: thank you, you have a great day now</p>
<p>you: I’m sorry</p>
<p><em>Next, calling your bank:</em></p>
<p>bank customer service agent: hello, this is bank!</p>
<p>you: you’d better fucking fix this</p>
<p>bank customer service agent: sorry what</p>
<p>you: ok well, the entire economic system underpinning western hegemony, the inability of “business” to prioritize long-term stability over short-term profit incentives, the intentional ignorance of any negative externalities, the way “increasing shareholder value” is treated like some sort of natural law like gravity or an unalterable immutable imperative when actually it’s what a bunch of people just happened to decide-</p>
<p>bank customer service agent: sir,</p>
<p>you: I need my bill payment limit raised</p>
<p>bank customer service agent: okay I’ve done that for you is there anything else I can help you with?</p>
<p>you: no thanks</p>
<p>bank customer service agent: okay grea-</p>
<p>you: wait. is there anything I can help <em>you</em> with…</p>
<p>bank customer service agent: …</p>
<p>you: like, say, unionization?</p>
<p>bank: sir this conversation is recorded but I blinked my eyes very slowly twice</p>
<p>you: I understand you</p>
<hr/>
<p>some idiot, interjecting in this imaginary conversation: sir, may I interest you in our pamphlet, superbowl ad with a QR code which later precipitated a fight with one of the best ad agencies in the world when the crypto CEO claimed to come up with the idea all by themselves, an influencer campaign on tiktok, a coordinated media blitz by CAA, the creative artists agency, the most powerful group of agents in the world, and numerous twitter threads about our lord and savior crypto, who will save you from this hell you’re going through?</p>
<p>you: you again. fuck off. off you fuck. fuck off so far you’re a tiny fucking dot.</p>
<hr/>
<p>a google product manager, watching this imaginary conversation and stressed out about their OKRs: hey you know how we like do smart parsing of email in gmail and extract structured data like flight numbers, hotel reservations, delivery tracking IDs and so on from peoples’ email? What if we also did that but for financial data and also for everything people stored in Google Drive</p>
<p>you: Google Drive, where you do copyright takedowns on files containing just the number “1”</p>
<p>google product manager: …</p>
<p>you: Google Drive, where you do copyright takedowns on files named .ds_store, automatically created by Macs</p>
<p>google product manager: …</p>
<p>you: … with Gmail, where you were so aggressive about mining receipt data from Amazon that when I get a receipt from Amazon now it doesn’t actually include what I bought because Amazon are terrified you’ll use that data to profile me and sell more ads</p>
<p>google product manager: …</p>
<p>you: …</p>
<p>google product manager: …yeah but it’d be great right, and it might increase engagement and I might get a promotion?</p>
<p>you: are you fucking kidding me no</p>
<p>google product manager: also a chat app</p>
<hr/>
<p>someone on at a place in which you will never find a more wretched hive of disruption and innovation, but also called hacker news: hey we should found a startup that automatically logs into peoples’ bank accounts and downloads their statements and then stores them on amazon s3 in a badly configured bucket that’s ultimately publicly accessible to the entire world and then when that happens blame amazon for an opaque and insecure management tool but instead it’s obviously our fault for moving fast and breaking things</p>
<p>you: no don’t do that</p>
<p>another person in that same thread: no seriously this is a legit product opportunity and also if banks had open APIs then this would create competitive pressure for financial institutions and banks to innovate in the area and-</p>
<p>you: also, you know, as a society, we could decide that access to archived financial information is important given how critical it is to participating in the economy and also the banks should keep the fucking pdfs and let you download them and not fucking delete them</p>
<p>another person, ignoring you, because that kind of regulation would be bad and restrict innovation and disruption: no, what we should do is reinvent the entire financial system from first principles</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Meanwhile, at Dropbox:</em></p>
<p>newly minted MBA ex-consultant who’s just started working at Dropbox as a product manager: and here is my presentation about why it is imperative for us to expand from file synchronization and, for some reason, password management, into financial service integration through our automated financial information archival tool, and then ultimately into financial services, which will strengthen our moat against competition from other file synchronization services</p>
<p>you: also no</p>
<p>newly minted MBA ex-consultant who’s just started working at Dropbox as a product manager: but we need to offer you new features so we can charge you more</p>
<p>you: I just wanted to synchronize some files across some computers</p>
<p>newly minted MBA ex-consultant who’s just started working at Dropbox as a product manager: but you’re annoyed about your bank</p>
<p>you: just stay in your fucking lane</p>
<p>newly minted MBA ex-consultant who’s just started working at Dropbox as a product manager: how about we do password management</p>
<p>you: oh fuck off please, I already feel like I’m held hostage by you</p>
<hr/>
<p>you: you know, all I wanted to do was move money from one account, at a bank, to another of my accounts, at another bank</p>
<p>someone from the UK: haha, you live in America</p>
<p>you: don’t. fucking. rub. it. in.</p>
<hr/>
<p>you: you know what, bank, if you offered annual PDF statements I could download that would be great</p>
<p>bank: it would, wouldn’t it</p>
<p>you: you should do that</p>
<p>bank: no</p>
<p>you: but-</p>
<p>bank: instead you can get all your transaction data as a csv, an xlsx, or an ofx or whatever Quicken or Microsoft Money thing</p>
<p>you: is Microsoft Money even still a thing-</p>
<p>bank: no</p>
<p>you: wait, I just tried and your transaction data only goes back so far anyway, but it does go slightly further than the PDF statements you deleted</p>
<p>bank: yeah, great right?</p>
<p>you: ok though, you understand the reason why I need a statement? </p>
<p>bank: no</p>
<p>you: It’s because our society operates on trust which is mediated by various signals between individuals and institutions, and one such signal is that there is an artifact which used to be on paper and delivered by mail with a bunch of numbers on it and that paper has my address on it and a picture of your logo and looks like you made it and now it’s a pdf</p>
<p>bank: yes sir</p>
<p>you: you see where I’m going</p>
<p>bank: no</p>
<p>you: ok well is it <em>technically illegal</em> if I take all that transaction data and then automate transforming and reformatting it into PDFs that are indistinguishable from an actual PDF statement issued by you, ending up with statements recreated from transaction data that where I can’t access the “original statement”?</p>
<p>bank: …</p>
<p>you: …</p>
<p>bank: would you like a mortgage?</p>
<p>you: ok I’m doing it anyway</p>
<p>the electronic frontier foundation: hi, did someone call asking for help before they get sued or arrested?</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Later, on that same place in which you will never find a more wretched hive of disruption and innovation, but also called hacker news:</em></p>
<p>a disruptor: show hn: I couldn’t get historical bank statements so here’s a Github repo for turning your exported transaction data into reproductions bank statements and I’ve also created a plugin system with templates for the top n North American banks by total number of customers</p>
<p>disruptors and innovators: oh hey cool</p>
<p>another disruptor, replying: but did you write it in rust</p>
<p>another disruptor, replying: we should recreate the entire financial system from first principles</p>
<p>another disruptor, replying: hodl!</p>
<p>you: will you all of you just fucking stop</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>A flashback, from years ago:</em></p>
<p>a startup: hey you know what</p>
<p>you: what</p>
<p>a startup: you know how getting statements is hard</p>
<p>you: yes</p>
<p>a startup: and you know how you like paying for things</p>
<p>you: well I don’t like it but it’s something I have to d-</p>
<p>a startup: well also you know how you like emoji</p>
<p>you: again they just exist it’s not like I especially love the-</p>
<p>a startup: and how you send emoji to people</p>
<p>you: again yes but I don’t see what-</p>
<p>a startup: and how sometimes to pay for things other people pay for them so you pay them back for stuff like pizza or weed</p>
<p>you: yes, this is a thing people do</p>
<p>a startup: well you can pay people now using our app and use an emoji for the description</p>
<p>you: ok well that’s not entirely stup-</p>
<p>a startup: and we’ve made it so when you pay someone you tell every single person in the whole world</p>
<p>you: are you fucking kidding me</p>
<p>a startup: so now everyone can recreate your statement</p>
<p>you: that’s not how this works</p>
<p>a startup: yes it is</p>
<p>you: no. stop</p>
<p><em>Cut to present day:</em></p>
<p>a startup: remember us?</p>
<p>you: unfortunately yes</p>
<p>a startup: we’re a verb now</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Even later:</em></p>
<p>bank: hey guess what</p>
<p>you: what</p>
<p>bank: we have a chat app now</p>
<p>you: you sent me a fucking letter about this</p>
<p><em>While downloading a statement</em></p>
<p>bank: this is the chat app we told you about!</p>
<p>you: does it let me download my statements from 2016</p>
<p>bank: it looks like you want to download your latest monthly statement!</p>
<p>you: fuck the fuck off</p>
<p>bank: we do crypto now too</p>
<p>the wall street journal: bank leads innovation race with crypto chatbot implementation</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>A few months later:</em></p>
<p>trendy bank that didn’t think hard enough: oh hey</p>
<p>you, narrowing eyes: what</p>
<p>trendy bank: we heard you were having problems with statements</p>
<p>you: oh no</p>
<p>trendy bank: so we’re going to mail you a usb stick with all your statements on it, tell all your frie-</p>
<p>you: oh the fuck no don’t do that</p>
<p>trendy bank: too late</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>A few months later, again, during a zoom call</em></p>
<p>your mum: hey are you busy</p>
<p>you: kind of, I’m at work in a meeting. Is it urgent?</p>
<p>your mum: dad plugged in this usb stick we got from our bank even though I said not to and now we have no money</p>
<p>you: it wasn’t from the bank it was from scammers I’m coming home and gluing shut all the ports on everything jesus fuck why did we invent computers</p>
<hr/>
<p><em>Several months from now:</em></p>
<p>you, doing a keynote, when we do keynotes again: so this is a story about how applying digital to a broken process results in a broken digital process–</p>
<p>also you, but in therapy the next day: nothing I do ever changes how do I accept this reality</p>
