    <h1>2025 ARRL Field Day</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>ARRL Field Day is a radio communications event that brings together amateur radio operators (also called “hams”) within your community. The theme for 2025 Field Day is “Radio Connects” – highlighting the many ways that wireless technology connects people across distances near and far. The event is part picnic, campout, practice for emergencies, informal contest, and most of all, fun! ARRL Field Day is the most popular ham radio activity held annually in the US and Canada. On the fourth weekend in June each year, more than 31,000 hams get together with their radio clubs, schools, or friends to operate from remote locations.</p>
<p>For many radio clubs, ARRL Field Day is one of the highlights on their annual calendar. A typical Field Day site will showoff many aspects of amateur radio and its many roles.</p>
<p>Some groups use Field Day as an opportunity to practice their emergency communications readiness. ARRL Field Day is an annual demonstration and invites the general public and organizations to see how amateur radio can serve in an emergency, <b>When All Else Fails</b>®. Hams are well-known for their communications support in real disaster and post-disaster situations. Despite the development of very complex, modern communications systems — or maybe because they are so complex — ham radio has been called into action, again and again, to provide communications in crises when it really matters.</p>
<p>Amateur radio also inspires the next generation of technical leaders by providing a hands-on sandbox where students gain experience in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).</p>
<p>For those with a competitive spirit, Field Day stations compete to make radio contacts with as many other stations as possible while learning to operate radio equipment in challenging situations and less-than-optimal conditions. These same skills are used by hams who volunteer to help with large, preplanned, non-emergency events such as marathons and bike-a-thons; fundraisers such as walk-a-thons; celebrations such as parades, and exhibits at fairs, malls, and museums.</p>
<p><strong>Who is ARRL?</strong></p>
<p>With more than 137,000 members, ARRL is The National Association for Amateur Radio in the US. Our mission is to promote and protect the art, science, and enjoyment of amateur radio, and to develop the next generation of radio amateurs. ARRL and our affiliated radio clubs provide benefits to members to discover radio, to develop new skills, and to serve your local community.</p>
<p><strong>What is Amateur Radio?</strong></p>
<p>Often called “ham radio,” the Amateur Radio Service is a worldwide community of licensed operators using the airwaves with every conceivable means of communications technology. It is made up of people who enjoy learning and being able to transmit voice, data, and pictures through the airwaves to places near and far without depending on commercial systems. The amateur radio frequencies are the last remaining place in the usable radio spectrum where an individual can develop and experiment with wireless communications. Not only can hams build and modify their equipment, but they can also create new ways to communicate via the airwaves — and do it as a globally connected community. Many people in the hobby form lifelong friendships with people they wouldn’t have otherwise met. Many rock stars, Hollywood actors, and heads of state (and even your neighbor down the street) are ham radio operators. You can be, too! Get started at ARRL Field Day!</p>
