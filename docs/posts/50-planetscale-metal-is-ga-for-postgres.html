    <h1>$50 PlanetScale Metal Is GA for Postgres</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>By <!-- -->Richard Crowley<!-- --> | <time datetime="2025-12-15">December 15, 2025</time></p><p>Today we’re making <a href="https://planetscale.com/metal">PlanetScale Metal</a> for Postgres available in smaller sizes and at much lower price points, all the way down to the new M-10 for as little as $50 per month.<!-- --> <!-- -->We’ve lowered the floor from 16GiB of RAM with four sizes all the way to 1GiB and paired these with eight storage capacities ranging from 10GB to 1.2TB.</p><p>These new sizes are powered by the same blazingly fast, locally attached NVMe drives that customers like <a href="https://code.cash.app/planetscale-metal">Cash App</a>, <a href="https://x.com/leerob/status/1961450054440423458">Cursor</a>, and <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/evolving-intercoms-database-infrastructure-lessons-and-progress/">Intercom</a> use to decrease latency, increase reliability, and decrease costs, too.</p><h2 id="decoupling-cpu-ram-and-storage"><a href="#decoupling-cpu-ram-and-storage">Decoupling CPU, RAM, and Storage</a></h2><p>This release is the first step towards decoupling CPU and RAM from storage capacity, while maintaining all the benefits of PlanetScale Metal.<!-- --> <!-- -->Each of these new CPU and RAM sizes can choose from at least five storage capacities, all of which still use locally attached NVMe drives.<!-- --> <!-- -->Customers can spec their PlanetScale Metal database to perfectly match their workload while still enjoying the lowest possible latency, the fewest possible failure modes, and online resizing.</p><p><picture><source srcset="https://planetscale-images.imgix.net/assets/metal-storage-sizes-fhfcNuEa.png?auto=compress%2Cformat" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light), (prefers-color-scheme: no-preference)"/><img alt="Metal storage sizes" height="1467" loading="lazy" src="https://planetscale-images.imgix.net/assets/metal-storage-sizes-fhfcNuEa.png?auto=compress%2Cformat" width="2123"/></picture></p><p>Decoupling CPU and RAM from storage capacity means you can get as much as 300GB of storage per GiB of RAM, almost four times the highest density AWS offers natively.<!-- --> <!-- -->Or you can max out CPU and RAM on minimal storage to serve small, high-traffic workloads.<!-- --> <!-- -->The choice is finally yours.</p><p>Since we launched PlanetScale Metal, customers have asked loudly for two things:</p><ol><li>A lower starting price, which we’re reducing today from $589 per month to $50 per month.</li><li>Flexibility to buy more storage without also buying more CPU and RAM.</li></ol><p>Today we’re proud to deliver on both requests.<!-- --> <!-- -->PlanetScale Metal is now available for Postgres Databases in AWS regions on both Intel and ARM CPUs with more I/O capacity than you can possibly use.<!-- --> <!-- -->Support for GCP is in the works and Vitess will follow soon.</p><p><a href="https://app.planetscale.com/new">Create</a> a new database or <a href="https://app.planetscale.com/">resize</a> one you already have today.</p></article></div>
