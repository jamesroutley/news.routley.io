<p>Oil-funded groups are engaging in strategic harassment to stop scientists from revealing the nature of their politically-linked disinformation networks – in what should be a surprise to nobody.</p>



<p>A new report came out last week from the Climate &amp; Development Lab (CDL) at Brown University, titled “<a href="https://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/post/legal-entanglements-mapping-connections-of-anti-offshore-wind-groups-and-their-lawyers-in-the-easte">Legal Entanglements: Mapping Connections of Anti-Offshore Wind Groups and their Lawyers in the Eastern United States</a>.”</p>



<p>The study focuses on several examples of law firms with connections to anti-wind groups, the fossil fuel industry, and the American political right wing. These fossil-funded groups have spread disinformation to slow the adoption of clean and cheap wind power, in order to keep America addicted to the poison that the fossil fuel industry wants to keep selling us.</p>



<p>The lab is headed by J Timmons Roberts, but the research was done by various students and faculty at at the lab. The new report builds on<a href="https://www.climatedevlab.brown.edu/anti-offshorewindnetwork"> former research by the CDL</a> cataloguing extensive connections between these groups and the dark money networks that fund the anti-wind movement.</p>	
	



<h2 id="h-why-the-east-coast-needs-offshore-wind">Why the East Coast needs offshore wind</h2>



<p>Offshore wind, especially in the North Atlantic, is a cheap and abundant form of energy that is heretofore relatively untapped in the US. It also has very little environmental cost, given that its carbon emissions and land use are both zero, and wind tends to be quite consistent over the ocean, making it more reliable as a power source.</p>



<p>Many other countries have successfully implemented offshore wind projects to bring this cheap and clean power to their populaces, with particular booms in China, the UK, Vietnam, Germany and several other Northern European countries (like Denmark, where many large wind power companies are based).</p>



<p>And wind is important for the global transition to renewable energy and the fight against climate change. As a zero-emission power source, it’s essential for meeting the US East Coast’s climate and renewable energy goals, and could provide a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/we.1524">huge chunk of the power needs</a> for the entire US Eastern seaboard, where the country’s population is clustered.</p>



<p>However, offshore wind has recently encountered setbacks due to the spread of disinformation from fossil-funded networks, which has made its way into the popular conception and into right-wing politics. (Nevertheless, Americans of all political stripes <a href="https://turnforward.org/june-2025-tarrance-poll/">still support greater deployment of offshore wind</a>)</p>



<h2 id="h-how-and-why-fossil-fuel-companies-oppose-wind">How and why fossil fuel companies oppose wind</h2>



<p>Fossil fuel companies oppose wind power because it would help to wean America off of fossil fuels, displacing coal and methane generation for electricity and enabling greater electrification of the vehicle fleet to wean us off of oil. All of these would result in air quality improvements, cost reductions, health improvements and avoidance of climate change – which are all anathema to the<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38030155/"> most deadly industry the world has ever seen</a>.</p>



<p>So, fossil fuel companies have developed and funded a complicated network of fake public interest groups, politicians and lawyers to oppose wind power by spreading disinformation. And the CDL’s report highlights how certain legal firms have received funding from fossil fuel companies and/or given support to these fake public interest groups in attempts to sue wind projects out of existence.</p>

<p>While many of these lawsuits have been unsuccessful, they can still add delays to a project, making it more expensive and slower to deploy (which then makes your electricity more expensive). In some cases, the delays can result in project cancellation, like when oil billionaire William Koch sued Cape Wind out of existence via a fake public interest group called the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound.</p>



<p>In the report, five specific legal networks are highlighted in particular, showing how each is related to fossil fuels and science denial. The networks have provided representation, written comments, filed lawsuits and otherwise spread disinformation in an attempt to stop the public good that offshore wind power represents.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-nature-of-the-disinformation">The nature of the disinformation</h2>



<p>The disinformation largely focuses on the North Atlantic Right Whale, a whale whose population is currently experiencing an “unusual mortality event” due to changing climate and Atlantic shipping and fishing.</p>



<p>Anti-wind groups have invoked laws like the Endangers Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act, despite the fact that the products of the industry they are funded by are <a href="https://electrek.co/2022/12/12/oil-funded-lobbyists-are-trying-to-trick-you-into-killing-more-whales/">the deadliest thing for marine life</a>.</p>



<p>Burning oil raises both the temperature and <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/acidification.html">acidity</a> of our oceans, disrupting marine ecosystems in profound ways. For example, North Atlantic krill populations have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-02159-1">dropped by 50%</a> due to ocean warming driven by fossil fuel use. Krill are the main food source for the North Atlantic Right Whale, which anti-wind groups claim to be interested in protecting, but are in fact aiding the decline of.</p>



<p>Further, whale populations are directly harmed by vessel strikes, which are <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/2017-2025-north-atlantic-right-whale-unusual-mortality-event">the leading direct cause of death</a> for North Atlantic Right Whales in recent years. And<a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/special-topics/World_Oil_Transit_Chokepoints"> 29% of those vessels are carrying oil across the globe</a> – shipments that would be unnecessary if transportation were powered by clean renewable energy instead of deadly oil. Not only that, but some of the exact same groups that oppose wind also opposed <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/08/01/2022-16211/amendments-to-the-north-atlantic-right-whale-vessel-strike-reduction-rule">draft regulations to reduce vessel strikes</a>, showing that they are actually interested in continuing to harm whales, not protecting them.</p>



<h2 id="h-law-firm-responds-to-the-truth-by-pressuring-university-to-hide-it">Law firm responds to the truth by pressuring university to hide it</h2>



<p>One of the law firms highlighted in the report, Marzulla Law, sent a letter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/25/climate/brown-university-offshore-wind-marzulla.html?unlocked_article_code=1.g08.cAcd.MyLJWrRWdIhk&amp;smid=url-share">threatening its authors</a>. Marzulla Law said it would complain to mommy… I mean, Brown’s funding sources, including the US Department of Energy which a former oil executive is currently squatting as the head of, in an attempt to get the entirety of Brown University’s funding pulled if the CDL doesn’t self-censor its research findings.</p>



<p>The CDL itself is not funded by the Department of Energy, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-25/offshore-wind-opponents-target-work-of-brown-university-researcher?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjEzMzE2MCwiZXhwIjoxNzU2NzM3OTYwLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUpUS05HUEZIT0EwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiIxMjIyNkM4MjZDN0Q0REM1OUFDRDFGQkVERjdENEFEMCJ9.K2jKVgvuogRnmk49m-UBSS4mDgVMhj8tb8zQA3E7vkw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Roberts said to Bloomberg</a>, so the threat isn’t even related to CDL’s funding sources, but to Brown University’s as a whole.</p>







<p>Marzulla Law represented one of the disinformation groups which the CDL has <a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/falmouth/anti-wind-group-uses-deceit-delay-denial-sabotage-clean-energy">highlighted before</a>, the deceptively-named “Green Oceans.” Green Oceans opposed the Revolution Wind project, which was <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/offshore-wind/trump-admin-halts-construction-of-nearly-finished-offshore-wind-farm">halted on Friday</a> over fake national security concerns by a convicted felon who is <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/amendment-14/section-3/?wpmobileexternal=true">Constitutionally barred from holding office in the US</a>, despite the project already being 80% finished, costing the US billions in waste and increased utility bills.</p>



<p>Mike Herr, a spokesman for Green Oceans said “these oft-repeated lies are designed to discredit the messenger while preventing the public from absorbing the substance of our valid and well-researched concerns,” which <strong>is itself an example of the very thing he’s wrongly accusing the researchers of</strong>.</p>



<p>Herr’s organization<a href="https://patch.com/massachusetts/falmouth/anti-wind-group-uses-deceit-delay-denial-sabotage-clean-energy"> lies about offshore wind</a>, and their attack on science (through their law firm) is designed to discredit the messenger while preventing the public from absorbing the substance of valid and well-researched concerns: the connection between fossil fuels, the republican party, and disinformation that keeps us from embracing superior forms of cheaper, cleaner energy like wind.</p>

<p>Discrediting science and knowledge is increasingly becoming a feature of the American right wing, which is currently on a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-14/princeton-plans-new-budget-cuts-as-pressure-from-trump-builds?srnd=undefined">crusade against universities</a> as it <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2019/08/19/the-growing-partisan-divide-in-views-of-higher-education-2/">tries to make America stupider</a>.</p>



<p>Roberts called Marzulla’s response “strategic harassment to shut me up and waste my time and make me more cautious,” which is a common reaction faced by truth-tellers in this day and age, particularly when funding from the largest and most deadly industry on the planet, which has <a href="https://commonhome.georgetown.edu/topics/climateenergy/defense-denial-and-disinformation-uncovering-the-oil-industrys-early-knowledge-of-climate-change/">repeatedly shown its interest in propaganda</a>, is involved.</p>




	<p>For its part, Brown University did not comment on Marzulla’s demands, but did state that “Scholars shape their own research and course of instruction at Brown. One principle that is core to research at Brown is the ability for scholars to discuss contested topics and themes and to have those topics openly debated.”</p>



<p>However, Brown is one of the universities which recently <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/31/nx-s1-5486581/brown-university-agreement-restore-federal-funding">kowtowed to the idiotic demands of an inept moron</a>, making its words about academic independence ring somewhat hollow. We’ll have to see if they step up to defend truth this time around, or bend the knee to one of the dumbest people on the planet once again, if it comes to that.</p>
