		<p><em>(content note: scientific discussion of depression &amp; suicide)</em></p>
<p>
<b>&#34;Too Long; Didn&#39;t Read&#34; Summary:</b></p>
<p>The &#34;standardized effect size&#34; of antidepressants on depression, vs placebo, is around 0.4. (On average; some people respond much better or much worse.) This is like going from a <strong>C to a C+</strong>.</p>
<p>In contrast: the effect size of 1500 mg/day of &#34;≥60% EPA&#34; Omega-3 supplements — which are cheaper &amp; have fewer side effects than antidepressants — is a bit higher, around 0.6. This is like going from a <strong>C to a B–</strong>.</p>
<p>But, much better: the effect size of 5000 IU/day of Vitamin D is around <em>1.8.</em> This is like going from a <strong>C to an A–</strong>! It works even for people who <em>don&#39;t</em> have a Vitamin D insufficiency, which almost half of American adults <em>do</em>.</p>
<p>Even if you&#39;re already taking Vitamin D &amp; Omega-3, you may <em>still</em> not be taking enough. The &#34;official&#34; recommendations are all several times too low, and newer research shows that the official &#34;max safe dose&#34; for Vitamin D is 2 times too low. Both these supplements are safe, cheap, and over-the-counter, with <em>positive</em> side-effects (on Covid &amp; cognition).</p>
<p>So, unless you have specific reasons to not take Vitamin D &amp; Omega-3 — (kidney stones, blood thinners, etc) — please try them, for at least a month! They could save your mental health. Maybe even your life.</p>
<p>(edit — oh hi <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46808251">Hacker News</a>! also, <a href="https://github.com/ncase/blog/issues/4">thank you Josep for catching my terrible typo</a>; I meant 5000 <em>IU/day</em> for Vitamin D, <em>NOT</em> 5000 mg. Jeez.)</p>
<p>(edit 2 — I said this in the conclusion but I&#39;ll move it earlier up: you can take these supplements <em>alongside</em> traditional antidepressants! You can stack interventions! The research shows that they&#39;re still effective even when combined with regular meds. As always, &#34;ask your doctor&#34;, show them the peer-reviewed papers cited in this post.)</p>

<h2>A crash course in &#34;effect sizes&#34;</h2>
<p>In Alicetown, the average person has 4 younger cousins.</p>
<p>Alright, not so surprising. You may not even notice a difference.</p>
<p>In Alicetown, the average person has 4 limbs.</p>
<p>You&#39;d <em>definitely</em> notice.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the same absolute difference (4 vs 3) <em>and</em> relative difference (3/4). So what makes limbs more surprising than cousins? Well, partly it&#39;s more dramatic &amp; visible, but also because: <em>we expect high variation in the number of someone&#39;s younger cousins, but not their number of limbs</em>.</p>
<p>This is why scientists calculate an <strong>&#34;effect size&#34;</strong> or <strong>&#34;standardized mean difference&#34;</strong> (&#34;mean&#34; = average). We take the difference between two groups, then divide by the total amount of variation, <em>to account for how surprising a difference is</em>.</p>
<p>(This is a health article, not a math article, so I&#39;ll skip the formulas in this post. If you&#39;re curious, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTgouKMz-eI">: check out this 4 min video</a>.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately for laypeople, the effect size is usually just reported as a number, like &#34;+0.74&#34; for <a href="http://www.lscp.net/persons/ramus/docs/EPR20.pdf">spacing out your studying vs cramming</a>, or &#34;–0.776&#34; for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20438143/">sleep deprivation on attention</a>.</p>
<p>But what&#39;s that <em>mean?</em> How can we make these numbers <em>intuitive?</em></p>
<p>Well, a common way for data to be is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">a bell-shaped curve</a> (also called a &#34;normal distribution&#34;). And most of us are, alas, well-acquainted with the bell curve in school grades. (&#34;grading on a curve&#34;)</p>
<p>So: school grades give us a useful way to think about standardized effect sizes! We can now convert that number <em>into an actual letter grade:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>F:</strong> -2.0 below average</li>
<li><strong>D:</strong> -1.0 below average</li>
<li><strong>C:</strong> average</li>
<li><strong>B:</strong> +1.0 above average</li>
<li><strong>A:</strong> +2.0 above average</li>
</ul>
<p>(see footnote for more precise ranges. the units are in &#34;standard deviations&#34;, or &#34;sigmas&#34;. what&#39;s sigma? <s>sigma ba--</s> just a unit of &#34;how far away this is from average, relative to the total variation&#34;.)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/bell_grade.png" alt="How to convert effect sizes to letter grades" title="How to convert effect sizes to letter grades"/></p>
<p>For example: spacing out your studying, relative to cramming, will on average <em>lift</em> your test scores from a C to a B–. (effect size = +0.74) And short-term sleep deprivation, relative to healthy sleep, will on average <em>tank</em> your ability to pay attention from a C to a D+. (effect size: –0.776)</p>
<p>(Note — when reading about effect sizes, always remember: <em>effect of what, on what, at what dose, for which group, relative to what?</em> See the Data Colada post, <a href="https://datacolada.org/104">Meaningless Means</a>.)</p>
<p>(Note 2 — the standard way of &#34;intuitively&#34; describing effect sizes is Cohen&#39;s recommendations: 0.2 = small, 0.5 = medium, 0.8 = large. Personally, I prefer the &#34;school grade letter&#34; comparison, since it&#39;s more concrete. But hey, you do you.)</p>
<p>But it&#39;s not limited to just grades &amp; academic performance. Effect sizes can also help us understand any kind of difference between groups, in observation or in experiments!</p>
<p>For example...</p>

<h2>Depression!</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s use our school grade analogy, to interpret effect sizes on mental health:</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s an &#34;F in mental health&#34;?</strong> By definition of a bell curve, ~2.3% of people are below –2 sigma (an &#34;F&#34;). (See: <a href="https://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~mbognar/applets/normal.html">this bell curve calculator</a>.) <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/healthy-living/suicide-canada-key-statistics-infographic.html">In Canada</a>, ~2.6% of people had suicidal ideation in 2022, while <a href="https://www.pew.org/en/research-and-analysis/data-visualizations/2024/us-national-trends-and-disparities-in-suicidal-ideation-suicide-attempts-and-health-care-use">in the US</a>, it was ~4.9% in 2019. So, it&#39;s not too far off to say: &#34;F in mental health = literally suicidal&#34;. (Also, reminder that ~4% is 1-in-25 people. You likely know someone, or <em>are</em> someone, who will feel suicidal this year. Please reach out to your friends &amp; loved ones!)</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s a &#34;D in mental health&#34;?</strong> ~16% of people are below –1 sigma (a &#34;D&#34;) on a bell curve. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12096700/">The Keyes 2002 study</a> estimated that ~14.1% of adults meet the DSM-III criteria for a major depressive episode. So, D = Depressed.</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s an average &#34;C in mental health&#34;?</strong> ~68% of people are within a sigma of average (a &#34;C&#34;) on a bell curve. Same above study found that 56.6 percent had moderate mental health. They were neither &#34;languishing&#34; nor &#34;flourishing&#34;. I guess C = Could Be Worse.</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s a &#34;B in mental health&#34;?</strong> ~16% of people are <em>above</em> +1 sigma (a &#34;B&#34;) on a bell curve. Same above study found that 17.2% of adults are &#34;flourishing&#34;. Good for them! B = Flourishing, life is good.</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s an &#34;A in mental health&#34;?</strong> I don&#39;t know who these freaks are. I actually <em>could not</em> find any scientific studies on &#34;the +2 sigma in well-being&#34;. In contrast, there&#39;s <em>lots</em> of research on suicidal ideation, the –2 sigma in well-being. In the absence of any actual data, I&#39;ll just say: A = AWESOME</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/bell_curve_mental_health.png" alt="Bell curve of mental health, mapped to effect size / letter grade." title="Bell curve of mental health, mapped to effect size / letter grade."/></p>
<p>So, if an intervention is found to have an effect size of +1.0, that&#39;s like going up a letter grade. If something&#39;s found to have an effect size of -2.0, that&#39;s like going <em>down</em> two letter grades. And so on.</p>
<p>Okay, so how do we get peoples&#39; &#34;mental health grades&#34; up?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s look at antidepressants, Omega-3, and Vitamin D, in turn:</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Antidepressants</h2>
<p>The good news is they work. The bad news is they don&#39;t work as well as you&#39;d think they may work.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5889788/">Cipriani et al 2018</a></strong> is a recent meta-analysis (a study collecting lots of previous studies) that investigated 21 different antidepressants. The most effective antidepressant, <em>Amitriptyline</em>, relative to placebo, had an Odds Ratio of 2.13  — <a href="https://www.escal.site/">which converts to</a> a Cohen&#39;s d effect size of 0.417 — which is &#34;small-medium&#34; according to Cohen&#39;s recommendations. Or, by our school-letter-grade comparison: <strong>the best antidepressant would take your mental health grade from an F to F+, or C to C+.</strong></p>
<p>From Figure 3 of that paper, you can see that Amitriptyline has the highest estimated effect size, while the side effects are no worse than placebo:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/Figure3.jpg" alt="The effect sizes &amp; dropout rates of various antidepressants, vs placebo." title="The effect sizes &amp; dropout rates of various antidepressants, vs placebo."/></p>
<p>Sure, &#34;F to F+&#34; <em>can</em> be lifesaving, but… y&#39;know… that&#39;s not a lot. And again, this is the effect <em>on average.</em> Some people respond <em>much</em> better to antidepressants… while some respond much worse.</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Omega-3</h2>
<p>Keep getting confused on which fat is what? Me too. So, here&#39;s a crash course on various fats:</p>
<p>Fatty acids are chains of carbons &amp; hydrogens + two oxygens. They say &#34;OOH&#34; at one end, and &#34;HHH&#34; at the other end:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat1.png" alt="Diagram of a fatty acid, details in main text." title="Diagram of a fatty acid, details in main text."/></p>
<p>A saturated fatty acid is one where all the carbons&#39; free spots are filled up with hydrogens. (Hence, &#34;saturated&#34;) This makes the molecule stick straight out. This is why <em>long</em> saturated fatty acids — like those found in butter — tend to be solid at room temperature.</p>
<p>(Contrary to popular belief, saturated fats don&#39;t <em>literally</em> clog your arteries, like grease in plumbing pipes. What happens is <em>{ha ha I don&#39;t actually understand this}</em>. <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/cir.0000000000000510">Something about your cholesterol levels &amp; inflammation</a>.)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat2.png" alt="Diagram of saturated vs unsaturated fatty acid, details in main text." title="Diagram of saturated vs unsaturated fatty acid, details in main text."/></p>
<p>In contrast, <em>unsaturated</em> fatty acids have at least one hydrogen missing. This causes them to have a double-bond &#34;kink&#34; in the molecule. This makes them <em>not</em> stick out, which is why unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature. <em>Mono-unsaturated</em> fatty acids (MUFAs) — like in olive oil — only have one kink. <em>Poly-unsaturated</em> fatty acids (PUFAs) — like in fatty fish — have two or more kinks. Let&#39;s be mature adults about this, please.</p>
<p>For completeness: <em>trans fats</em> are unsaturated fats whose &#34;kink&#34; is twisted around, causing them to go straight. That is the worst sentence I&#39;ve written all month. The twisted kink is caused by the hydrogens being on opposite sides, hence &#34;trans&#34;. (And yes, if they&#39;re on the same side it&#39;s &#34;cis&#34;. Latin was a mistake.) The molecule being straight is why trans fats — which margarine <em>used</em> to be full of  — are solid at room temperature, despite being an unsaturated fat.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat3.png" alt="Diagram of how a &#39;cis&#39; saturated fat becomes a &#39;trans&#39; fat, details in main text." title="Diagram of how a &#39;cis&#39; saturated fat becomes a &#39;trans&#39; fat, details in main text."/></p>
<p>It&#39;s neat whenever you can trace the history of something right down to its atoms! Margarine was first invented because it&#39;s cheaper, and is spreadable straight from the fridge, unlike butter. Margarine (used to be) made by taking <em>unsaturated</em> vegetable oils, which were cheaper than animal fats, then pumping a bunch of hydrogens into it (hence, &#34;hydrogenated oils&#34;). If you <em>completely</em> hydrogenate an oil, it becomes a saturated fat. But they only <em>partially</em> hydrogenated those oils, leading to trans fats, which were cheaper &amp; a spreadable semi-solid at fridge temperature.</p>
<p>In the 1970s &amp; 80s, the US Food &amp; Drug Administration concluded that trans fats were <em>not</em> harmful to humans, and nutritionists <em>promoted</em> margarine over butter, because butter had &#34;unhealthy&#34; saturated fats. <a href="https://www.cspi.org/resource/artificial-trans-fat-timeline">But in the early 1990s</a>, scientists realized that trans fats were <em>even worse</em> for you than saturated fats. Only in the 2010&#39;s, did most Western countries start officially banning trans fats. Reminder: policy is often decades behind science.</p>
<p><em>(Hey, what do you call it when you get thiccer on HRT? Trans fat! :D)</em></p>
<p>I need to stop going on infodump tangents. Anyway, Omega-3 is any fatty acid with its first kink at the 3rd carbon from the Omega end (&#34;HHH&#34;), though it can have more kinks later down the chain. (And yes, Omega-6 has its first kink at the 6th carbon, and Omega-9 has its first kink at the 9th carbon. There&#39;s nothing <em>physically</em> preventing Omega-4 or Omega-5&#39;s from existing, but due to some quirk of evolution, Omega-3, -6, and -9 are the ones biological life uses most. As far as I can tell, there&#39;s no specific reason they&#39;re all multiples of 3. Probably just a coincidence. There <em>is</em> a less common Omega-7.)</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat4.png" alt="Diagram of Omega-3, -6, and -9, details in main text." title="Diagram of Omega-3, -6, and -9, details in main text."/></p>
<p><em>Finally</em>, there&#39;s three main types of Omega-3: EPA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid), DHA (Docosahexaenoic Acid), and ALA (Alpha-Linolenic Acid). ALA is mostly found in plants like chia seeds &amp; walnuts, while EPA &amp; DHA mostly come from seafood, though there <em>are</em> algae-based vegan sources.</p>
<p><em>(Figure 1.1 from <a href="https://atrium.lib.uoguelph.ca/bitstream/10214/9940/1/Roke_Kaitlin_201609_PhD.pdf">Roke 2016</a>.⤵ Thank you Kaitlin Samantha Roke for drawing this coz I&#39;m too lazy to draw it myself. Note how the first double-bond &#34;kink&#34; for all these molecules is at the 3rd carbon from the Omega end — hence why they&#39;re all called Omega-3&#39;s.)</em></p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat5.png" alt="Diagram of ELA, DHA, &amp; ALA; details in main text." title="Diagram of ELA, DHA, &amp; ALA; details in main text."/></p>
<p><strong>EPA &amp; DHA are the focus of this section.</strong> For bio-mechanical reasons I don&#39;t understand but I assume someone else does: EPA is the one associated with anti-inflammation, better brain health, and <em>less depression</em>... while DHA isn&#39;t. (But DHA is still needed for other stuff, like your neurons&#39; cell walls, so don&#39;t cut them out completely!)</p>
<p>(Note: I could not find any <em>experimental</em> trials of ALA on depression, though an <em>observational</em> study in Japan (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212826313001085">Kurotani et al 2014</a>) finds a correlation between higher ALA and lower depression. But reminder, correlation is not <em>necessarily</em> causation.)</p>
<p>All the above info in a Venn (technically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_diagram">Euler</a>) diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/fat6.png" alt="Diagram of what I infodumped about just now." title="Diagram of what I infodumped about just now."/></p>
<p>Okay, enough yap. Time for the actual data:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3534764/">Sublette et al 2011</a></strong> is an older meta-analysis, but it&#39;s the only one I could find that tries to estimate the <em>actual &#34;dose-response&#34; curve</em>, which shows: how much effect, for how much treatment. Why is that important? Because one problem with many meta-analyses is they&#39;ll do something like: &#34;Study 1 gave patients 1 gram of medicine and saw a +1 improvement in disease, Study 2 gave 10 grams and saw +4 improvement, Study 3 gave 100 grams and saw <em>negative</em> –5 improvement… the average of +1, +4, and –5 is zero... therefore the medicine&#39;s effect is zero.&#34; ...As mentioned briefly earlier, this is a <a href="https://datacolada.org/104">meaningless mean</a>. That&#39;s why we want to know the response <em>at each dose</em>.</p>
<p>So, the Sublette meta-analysis gathered randomized trials studying Omega-3 on depression (vs placebo, of course) and got the following dose-response curve.⤵ Note that the horizontal axis is <em>not</em> just amount of total Omega-3, but specifically <em>the extra amount of &#34;unopposed&#34; EPA, above the amount of DHA.</em> Or in other words, &#34;EPA minus DHA&#34;:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/Omega3.jpg" alt="Diagram of dose-response curve, of EPA minus DHA, on depression." title="Diagram of dose-response curve, of EPA minus DHA, on depression."/></p>
<p>The top effect size is <strong>around +0.558, which is like going from an F to D–, or C to B–.</strong> You get this maximum effect around 1 to 2 grams of extra EPA, and <em>too much</em> EPA gets worse results. The meta-analysis finds that Omega-3 supplements that are ~60% EPA (and the rest DHA) are optimal.</p>
<p>This finding is roughly in line with later meta-analyses. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-019-0515-5.pdf">Liao et al 2019</a> also finds that ~1 gram of ≥60% EPA is best, but actually found a much higher effect size: +1.03. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37028202/">Kelaiditis et al 2023</a> also finds 1 to 2g of ≥60% EPA is best, but found a lower effect size of +0.43… which is still <em>as good</em> as the <em>best</em> antidepressant!</p>
<p>Either way, let&#39;s boil this down to a recommendation. You want around 1 gram of EPA a day. So if your supplements are 60% EPA, you need 1 gram ÷ 0.6 ~= 1.667 grams = 1667 milligrams. Let&#39;s round this down for convenience: <strong>get 1500 mg/day of 60%-EPA Omega-3 supplements.</strong></p>
<p>In comparison, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-omega-3">most official health organizations recommend</a> &#34;250–500 mg <em>combined</em> EPA and DHA each day for healthy adults.&#34; <em>That is over three times too low,</em> at least for optimal effects on depression. Which, as we calculated above, is probably around 1500 mg/day. (The official safe dose is 5000 mg/day)</p>
<p>Finally, a (small) study <em>directly</em> investigating the link between suicide &amp; Omega-3. <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/ajp.2006.163.6.1100">Sublette et al 2006</a>: “Low [DHA] and low Omega-3 proportions [...] predicted risk of suicidal behavior among depressed patients over the 2-year period.” Though keep in mind this is a small study, and it&#39;s observational not experimental. Also, weird that contrary to the above studies on depression, <em>DHA</em> predicted suicide but <em>not</em> EPA. Not sure what to make of that.</p>
<p>Bonus: Omega-3 may also boost cognition? <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-16129-8.pdf">Shahinfar et al 2025</a>: “Enhancement of global cognitive abilities was observed with increasing omega-3 dosage up to 1500 mg/day. [effect size = 1.00, like going from a grade of C to B!], followed by downward trend at higher doses.”</p>
<hr/>

<h2>Vitamin D</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11650176/">Ghaemi et al 2024</a></strong> is a meta-analysis on Vitamin D on depression. Again, it actually estimates a dose-response curve! Below is Figure 1 + Table 2, showing the effect of Vitamin D dosage on depression vs placebo. The solid line is the average estimated effect, dashed lines are 95% confidence interval. Note the effect size is negative in this figure, because they&#39;re measuring <em>reduction</em> in depressive symptoms:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/VitaminD.png" alt="The effect size (with uncertainty) of Vitamin D dosage on depressive symptoms." title="The effect size (with uncertainty) of Vitamin D dosage on depressive symptoms."/></p>
<p><strong>The upper range of uncertainty is lowest at 5000 IU (International Units) of Vitamin D a day</strong>, with an estimated effect size of 1.82, with a 95% uncertainty range, from 0.98 to 2.66. <strong>An effect size of 1.82 is like taking your mental health from an F to a C–, or a C to an A–!</strong> And even in the <em>most pessimistic</em> case, 0.98, that&#39;s still <em>over twice as effective</em> as the top antidepressant!</p>
<p>(The paper&#39;s summary says <em>8000 IU</em> is best, with effect size 2.04, but there&#39;s much greater uncertainty there. The paper also finds that longer studies had smaller effects than shorter studies, but this does <em>not</em> necessarily mean Vitamin D&#39;s effects are short-lived. Looking at Supplementary Table 4, it seems this is partly because longer studies used <em>lower</em> average daily doses. For example, one 52-week study only gave participants 400 IU a day.)</p>
<p>This meta-analysis includes trials with participants who <em>don&#39;t</em> have Vitamin D deficiency. There&#39;s still a good effect of Vitamin D on depression for them, even if smaller! Though, you probably <em>are</em> lacking Vitamin D: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29644951/">Liu et al 2018</a> finds that a bit under half of all adults (41.4%) have Vitamin D Insufficiency.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s according to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-d-dosage">the official recommendation</a>, of 400-800 IU a day… which is <em>is too damn low</em>. Even the official <em>maximum safe dose</em> of Vitamin D, of 4000 IU/day, is too low. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30611908/">McCullough et al 2019</a> gave over thousands of patients 5,000 to 10,000 IU/day, for <em>seven years</em>, and there were <em>zero</em> cases of serious side effects. This is in line with <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746327/">Billington et al 2020</a>, a 3-year-long double-blinded randomized controlled trial, where they found &#34;the safety profile of vitamin D supplementation is similar for doses of 400, 4000, and 10,000 IU/day.&#34; (though &#34;<em>mild</em> hypercalcemia&#34; increased from 3% to 9%. IMHO, that&#39;s a small cost for reducing the risk of major depression &amp; suicide.)</p>
<p>And it makes sense that 10,000 IU a day <em>should</em> be safe. Your skin, exposed to the Sun&#39;s ultraviolet rays, can synthesize up to (the equivalent of) 10,000 IU a day, before plateauing out. Source is <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916522043763">Vieth 1999</a>: “Because vitamin D is potentially toxic, intake of [1000 IU/day] has been avoided even though the weight of evidence shows that the currently accepted [limit] of [2000 IU/day] is too low by at least 5-fold.” (So why are all the official sources still so paranoid about Vitamin D? Well, unfortunately, official/governmental policy is always a few decades behind the science in <em>any</em> field. See Also: the trans fat debate, everything about educational policy.)</p>
<p>Speaking of the Sun, why take supplements instead of just getting Vitamin D from Sun exposure? Well, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29659012/">skin cancer</a>. But also: because Sun-Skin D varies greatly depending on the season, your latitude, and your skin type. There&#39;s less ultraviolet rays from the Sun in winter/fall, and at latitudes further from the equator. And <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10861575/">the darker your skin is, the less Vitamin D your skin makes for the same amount of Sun exposure</a>. As expected from the bio-physics of skin, Black adults have <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6075634/">the highest prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency</a> (82.1%!!), followed by Hispanic adults (62.9%). (But hey, at least Black adults have the lowest incidence of skin cancer. You win some you lose some.) The point is: speaking as someone with Southeast Asian skin, who&#39;s currently in Canada during winter... even if I stood outside naked for hours, I&#39;d get approximately <em>zero</em> IU/day of Vitamin D from the Sun. Thus: supplements.</p>
<p>Finally, a meta-analysis <em>directly</em> measuring the effect of Vitamin D on suicide rates. <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s12888-025-06613-w.pdf">Yu et al 2025</a>: “Vitamin D in patients with [suicidal behaviours] were significantly lower than in controls (standardized mean difference: –0.69, or a &#39;medium&#39; difference)”. Reminder that this paper <em>by itself</em> only measures correlation, not causation — but combined with the above experiments of Vitamin D on depression, I think it&#39;s reasonable to guess it&#39;s partly causal.</p>
<p>To recap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Almost half of you have a Vitamin D deficiency according to the official recommendation (800 IU/day).</li>
<li>And the official recommendation is <em>way</em> too low. Even the official <em>maximum</em> safe dose (4000 IU/day) is below the optimal Vitamin D for depression (5000 IU/day) or what your body can produce from the Sun in optimal conditions (10,000 IU/day). Recent randomized controlled trials confirm that 10,000 IU/day is, indeed, mostly safe.</li>
<li>Your daily reminder than official policy is often decades behind the science.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bonus: Vitamin D supplementation was found in several randomized controlled trials <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39225947/">to reduce mortality from Covid-19</a>! It <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831322010274">probably helps guard against influenza</a> too, though the evidence is small &amp; early.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: <em>All this time, you lacked the Vitamin?</em></h2>
<p>Scurvy is caused by a lack of Vitamin C. It&#39;s a condition that causes your wounds to re-open up &amp; teeth to fall out. Scurvy used to kill <em>almost half(!)</em> of all sailors on major expeditions; it&#39;s estimated millions died. It can be cured by eating lemons.</p>
<p>Rickets is mostly caused by a lack of Vitamin D. It&#39;s a condition where kids&#39; bones go all soft and deformed. During the Industrial Revolution, up to 80% of kids suffered from it. It can be prevented with cod liver oil.</p>
<p>Goiters is mostly caused by a lack of Iodine. It&#39;s a condition where the thyroid gland in your neck swells up painfully, to the size of an apple. During WWI, a <em>third</em> of adult men had goiters. It can be prevented with iodized salt.</p>

<p><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/mental-health">About 1 in 4 people are expected to have clinical depression sometime in their life</a>. Depression is the #1 source of the global &#34;burden from disease&#34; in the mental health category, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease#how-do-different-diseases-and-disabilities-contribute-towards-the-burden-of-disease">and <em>that</em> category is the #6 burden of disease in the world</a>, above Alzheimer&#39;s, malaria, and sexually transmitted infections.</p>
<p>(But honestly, did you need those stats? This is likely a lived experience for a lot of you reading this.)</p>
<p>The effective altruists are all, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/how-much-does-it-cost-to-save-a-life">&#34;woah for just $3000 you can prevent a child&#39;s death from malaria&#34;</a> — and that&#39;s great! save them kids! — but where&#39;s the fanfare for the accumulating evidence that, &#34;woah with cheap daily supplements we can save millions from suicide &amp; depressed lives&#34;?</p>
<p>Over and over again throughout history, some horrific thing that caused millions to suffer, turned out to be &#34;yeah you were missing this one molecule lol&#34;. To be clear: not everything is gonna be <em>that</em> simple, and mental health is <em>not</em> &#34;just&#34; chemistry. Also, all the numbers on this page have with large error bars &amp; uncertainty, more research is needed.</p>
<p>But, as of right now, I feel I can at least confidently claim the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin D and Omega-3 are both <em>at least on par</em> with antidepressants.</li>
<li>The evidence is much stronger for Vitamin D; it&#39;s very plausibly at least <em>twice</em> as good as antidepressants.</li>
<li>Both supplements are cheap and safe, so what&#39;s the harm of trying? (positive &#34;expected value&#34; for this bet)</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<p><strong>MY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU TO DO A.S.A.P:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to a pharmacy, buy the following supplements over-the-counter, in whatever form you like: (I like the easy-to-swallow gel capsules)</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin D</strong>
<ul>
<li>🌱 By default, Vitamin D supplements are derived from… (quick web search)… <em>the grease in sheep&#39;s wool?</em> Huh. Also fish liver oil. Anyway, if you&#39;re vegan, make sure your bottle specifically says &#34;vegan&#34; or &#34;from lichen/mushrooms&#34;. (If you&#39;re vegetarian, the sheep&#39;s-wool Vitamin D is fine, they don&#39;t kill the sheep for it.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Omega-3 <em>where EPA is ~60% of the Omega-3 total.</em></strong> For example, my 500mg Omega-3 capsules have 300mg EPA, 200mg DHA.
<ul>
<li>🌱 By default, Omega-3 supplements come from fish. If you&#39;re veg(etari)?an, there <em>are</em> plant-based sources of Omega-3, but look carefully: most vegan Omega-3 supplements provide <em>more DHA than EPA</em>, which the above studies suggest fully cancel out the antidepressant effect. <em>Double check the nutritional label to make sure it&#39;s ≥60% EPA.</em> For example, <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Natures-Way-NutraVege-Plant-Based-Vegetarian/dp/B078T4DC2K?th=1">this one is 300mg EPA + 200mg DHA</a>. (<em>not</em> an affiliate link)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Then, every day:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take ~5000 IU of Vitamin D</strong>
<ul>
<li>⚠️ be cautious if you have kidney stones, or are on medications that could interact with Vitamin D. &#34;ask your doctor&#34;.</li>
<li>4,000 IU is the &#34;official maximum safe dose&#34;, if you understandably don&#39;t trust a random internet blogger, even though she cited peer-reviewed sources.</li>
<li>10,000 IU if you&#39;re feeling daring / have darker skin / live in less sunny climates.</li>
<li>bonus: may improve immune response to Covid &amp; influenza?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Take ~1500 mg of ≥60%-EPA Omega-3</strong>
<ul>
<li>⚠️ be cautious if you&#39;re on blood thinners, or other medications that could interact with Omega-3. again, &#34;ask your doctor&#34;.</li>
<li>bonus: may improve cognition?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(Don&#39;t quit your existing antidepressants if they&#39;re net-positive for you!)
<ul>
<li>you may also want to ask your doctor about <em>Amitriptyline</em>, or those other best-effect-size antidepressants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you get these doses of Vitamin D &amp; Omega-3 through whole foods alone, no supplements? Probably, but it&#39;d be expensive &amp; tedious: you&#39;d have to eat something like 2,000 calories of farmed salmon <em>a day</em> to get 5,000 IU/day of Vitamin D. As for Omega-3, eating mostly oily fishes <em>would</em> get you &gt;1000mg of Omega-3, but they&#39;d be <em>more DHA than EPA</em>, which the above studies suggest would cancel out the antidepressant effects.</p>
<p><strong>The effect sizes on depression:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The best antidepressant: <strong>+0.417</strong>
<ul>
<li>like your mental health grade going from F to F+, or C to C+</li>

<p><img src="https://blog.ncase.me/content/stuff/2026-01/depression/on-depression-summary.png" alt="Diagram of all the above estimated effect sizes" title="Diagram of all the above estimated effect sizes"/></p>
<p>(And remember, you can <em>stack</em> any of the above interventions to get an even larger effect! You can&#39;t just naively add up the effect sizes, but I&#39;d be surprised if the effect of {vitamin d + omega-3 + bright lamps + cardio + good sleep + meditation} <em>combined</em> ends up being less than +2.00. Two letter grades up means going from D to B, or, theoretically, from clinically depressed to flourishing! For more papers &amp; my working research notes on &#34;best bang for buck on depression&#34;, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hjNxJmNjoVktrJDFPtFH1hgzKmGpZkRFQ6Vwf0s7c6w/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.e0blw3xq3cvm">check out this Google Doc</a>.)</p>
<p>Also, remember that all the above estimates are uncertain. And in general, when scientists replicate psychology experiments more rigorously, the effect size usually shrinks by ½. But, I think the overall <em>qualitative</em> picture is still strong: there <em>exist</em> high bang-for-buck ways to reduce depression, which are <em>at least</em> on par with drugs &amp; therapy (possibly 2x to 4x better), that aren&#39;t (yet) common knowledge amongst policymakers &amp; the public. And again, they&#39;re dirt cheap with minor-to-no adverse side effects. Moderate chance of a big win, for a known tiny cost. That&#39;s a positive &#34;expected value&#34; bet right there.</p>
<p>I got onto this research rabbithole a few months ago while borrowing my housemate&#39;s ADHD meds, which I may or may not eventually collect into a &#34;JOYMAXXING&#34; informal meta-meta-analysis. (<a href="https://youtu.be/JOj97Edna7k?si=xAUt3Kp54RyfGX50&amp;t=334">: See me yap about it on video as a cartoon cat</a>.) But for this blog post, I wanted to dive deeper into Vitamin D and Omega-3, since their effect sizes are so huge, <em>and</em> they&#39;re insultingly cheap &amp; easy, compared to therapy or regular cardio.</p>
<p>Stay safe this winter, keep away the seasonal depression. Get your supplements, and reach out to your friends &amp; loved ones!</p>
<p>💖,</p>
