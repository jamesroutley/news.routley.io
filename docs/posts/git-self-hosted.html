<p>During a recent coffee chat, I was talking about a little learning
project that I built for myself and my conversation partner asked “Is it
online somewhere? I can’t find it on your GitHub”. The question made me
pause, because I remembered that it was in fact online, but not in the
usual place people look.</p>
<p>Since 2021, <a href="https://git.veitheller.de/">I’ve operated my own
Git server</a>. I’ve never advertised it, since it mostly contains
things I’ve developed for myself. It does, however, hold around 90
repositories, including things like my <a href="https://git.veitheller.de/hellerve/at-large">website’s source
code</a>, my <a href="https://git.veitheller.de/hellerve/resume">resume</a>, <a href="https://git.veitheller.de/hellerve/dotfiles">all of my terminal
configurations</a>, and other small things that might be fun to
browse.</p>
<p>Some things to call out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git.veitheller.de/pl">The PL organization</a>
contains a few of my language implementation projects over the
years.</li>
<li><a href="https://git.veitheller.de/degrowth">The degrowth
organization</a> contains simple tools, such as a browser, a browser
rendering engine, a minimal Git implementation, a terminal editor, a
regular expression engine, and more. Most of these projects are pure
learning projects, but they might still be useful as a didactic
tool.</li>
<li><a href="https://git.veitheller.de/hellerve/infer">infer</a> is a
simple inference engine that solves syllogisms.</li>
<li><a href="https://git.veitheller.de/hellerve/alacritty-config">alacritty-config</a>
is a CLI tool and PyQt UI I use for managing my Alacritty terminal
configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some other gems and weird things in there, and it’s a good
supplemental showcase (next to my GitHub) of what I’ve done over the
years to understand systems and learn by doing.</p>
<p>Peruse it, and do tell me when you find something that’s cool,
interesting, or weird! I’d be more than happy to walk you through it or
write a blog post about anything on there.</p>
