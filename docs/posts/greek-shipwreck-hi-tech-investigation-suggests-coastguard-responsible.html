    <h1>Greek shipwreck: hi-tech investigation suggests coastguard responsible</h1>

There were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/16/greece-shipwreck-people-smuggling-suspects-arrested-as-search-continues">104 survivors</a>.</p><p>Reporters and researchers conducted more than 20 interviews with survivors and drew on court documents and coastguard sources to build a picture of missed rescue opportunities and offers of assistance that were ignored. Multiple survivors said that attempts by the Greek coastguard to tow the vessel had ultimately caused the sinking. The coastguard has strenuously denied that it attempted to tow the trawler.</p><p>The night that the trawler capsized, 47 nautical miles off Pylos, in south-western Greece, was <a href="https://counter-investigations.org/investigation/the-pylos-shipwreck">reconstructed using an interactive 3D model of the boat</a> created by <a href="https://counter-investigations.org">Forensis</a>, a Berlin-based research agency founded by Forensic Architecture, which investigates human rights violations.</p><figure id="7d7e3d38-4d4e-4c06-afa0-d1a94ff61f2b" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00efc528ee8ab2e640cf0b7bfbfdeeb708fbfa2b/0_0_2576_1718/master/2576.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00efc528ee8ab2e640cf0b7bfbfdeeb708fbfa2b/0_0_2576_1718/master/2576.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00efc528ee8ab2e640cf0b7bfbfdeeb708fbfa2b/0_0_2576_1718/master/2576.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00efc528ee8ab2e640cf0b7bfbfdeeb708fbfa2b/0_0_2576_1718/master/2576.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00efc528ee8ab2e640cf0b7bfbfdeeb708fbfa2b/0_0_2576_1718/master/2576.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00efc528ee8ab2e640cf0b7bfbfdeeb708fbfa2b/0_0_2576_1718/master/2576.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Body bags carrying corpses retrieved from the sea arrive in Kalamata." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00efc528ee8ab2e640cf0b7bfbfdeeb708fbfa2b/0_0_2576_1718/master/2576.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="445" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Body bags carrying corpses retrieved from the sea arrive in Kalamata.</span> Photograph: Stelios Misinas/Reuters</figcaption></figure><p>The joint investigation by the Guardian, German public broadcaster ARD/NDR/Funk and Greek investigative outlet Solomon, in collaboration with Forensis, has given one of the fullest accounts to <a href="https://pylos.counter-investigations.org/">date of the trawler’s course up to its sinking</a>. It unearthed new evidence such as a coastguard vessel moored at a closer port but never dispatched to the incident and how Greek authorities failed to respond not twice, as previously reported, but three times to offers of assistance by Frontex, the EU border and coastguard agency.</p><p>Forensis mapped the final hours before the sinking, using data from the coastguard’s log and the testimony of the coast guard vessel’s captain, as well as flight paths, maritime traffic data, satellite imagery and information from videos taken by nearby commercial vessels and other sources. The ship’s last movements contradict the coastguard and reveal inconsistencies within the official account of events, including the trawler’s direction and speed.</p><p>Crucially, the investigation showed the overcrowded trawler started moving westward on meeting the single Greek coastguard vessel sent to the scene. According to multiple survivor testimonies given to the Guardian and Greek prosecutors, the coastguard had told the migrants it would lead them to Italy – clashing with the official version that the trawler started moving west of its own accord. The investigation also showed the trawler had turned to the south and was almost stationary for at least an hour until, survivors said, a second and fatal towing attempt took place.</p><figure id="8db9f464-ffee-4b58-b221-1e0c9fed7b02" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-3"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c077042a50cfb2f53ff92e3f079afb3c9f23984a/0_0_3360_1892/master/3360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c077042a50cfb2f53ff92e3f079afb3c9f23984a/0_0_3360_1892/master/3360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c077042a50cfb2f53ff92e3f079afb3c9f23984a/0_0_3360_1892/master/3360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c077042a50cfb2f53ff92e3f079afb3c9f23984a/0_0_3360_1892/master/3360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c077042a50cfb2f53ff92e3f079afb3c9f23984a/0_0_3360_1892/master/3360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c077042a50cfb2f53ff92e3f079afb3c9f23984a/0_0_3360_1892/master/3360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Survivors use the 3D model of the boat to describe what happened on the night of the 14 June." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c077042a50cfb2f53ff92e3f079afb3c9f23984a/0_0_3360_1892/master/3360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="445" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Survivors use the 3D model of the boat to describe what happened on the night of the 14 June.</span> Photograph: Forensis</figcaption></figure><p>Two survivors used the 3D model to describe the towing itself, while three others, who were sitting inside or on the vessel’s lower deck, described being propelled forward “like a rocket”, but with the engine not operating.

The 920 was deployed from Chania, in Crete, about 150 nautical miles from the site of the sinking. The source said the coastguard had somewhat smaller but still capable vessels, based in Patras, Kalamata, Neapoli Voion and even Pylos itself. The 920 was ordered by coastguard HQ to “locate” the trawler at about 3pm local time on 13 June. It finally made contact close to midnight. An eyewitness official confirmed another vessel was stationed in Kalamata on 14 June and could have reached the trawler within a couple of hours. “It should have been a ‘send everything you’ve got’ situation.

This would not be without precedent. In 2014, an attempt to tow a refugee boat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/27/greek-boat-tragedy-migrant-survivors-mourn-lost-relatives">off the coast of Farmakonisi cost 11 lives</a>. Greek courts cleared the coastguard, but the <a href="https://www.infomigrants.net/en/post/41810/european-court-slams-greece-for-endangering-migrant-lives">European court of human rights passed a damning judgment</a> in 2022.</p><p>Allegations have also been made that survivors’ statements were tampered with. Two rounds of testimonies were given – first to the coastguard and then to a civil prosecutor – both seen by the Guardian. Testimonies to the coastguard by two separate survivors of different nationalities are word for word the same when describing the sinking: “We were too many people on the boat, which was old and rusty … this is why it capsized and sank in the end.”</p><p>Under oath to the civil prosecutor, days later, the same survivors describe towing incidents and blame the Greek coastguard for the sinking. The same Syrian survivor who stated in his coastguard testimony that the trawler capsized due to its age and overcrowding would later testify: “When they stepped on it, and I am sorry to mention this, our boat sank. I believe the reason was the towing by the Greek boat.”</p><figure id="de0c1a24-06c0-4f24-a727-bcb583f23330" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-7"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f563204403930588a9a7c4ec0540bc97d1a5075/0_0_6048_4024/master/6048.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f563204403930588a9a7c4ec0540bc97d1a5075/0_0_6048_4024/master/6048.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f563204403930588a9a7c4ec0540bc97d1a5075/0_0_6048_4024/master/6048.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f563204403930588a9a7c4ec0540bc97d1a5075/0_0_6048_4024/master/6048.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f563204403930588a9a7c4ec0540bc97d1a5075/0_0_6048_4024/master/6048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"/><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f563204403930588a9a7c4ec0540bc97d1a5075/0_0_6048_4024/master/6048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"/><img alt="Survivors of a shipwreck at the port in Kalamata." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f563204403930588a9a7c4ec0540bc97d1a5075/0_0_6048_4024/master/6048.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none" width="445" height="445" loading="lazy"/></picture></div><figcaption><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Survivors of a shipwreck at the port in Kalamata.</span> Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Brussels has asked for a “transparent” investigation into the wreck, while there is frustration within Frontex, which repeatedly offered assets to Greek authorities – a plane twice and later a drone – but received no reply.
