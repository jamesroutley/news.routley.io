<p>In my <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/startup_vibes/">startup announcement</a> I
alluded to a private mailing list. That’s been going quite well and I
find the weekly posting cadence to be a great way to stay accountable,
take stock of my current situation, and plan out the next week of work.
These weekly updates have also generated a decent amount of conversation
and fortuitous connections.</p>
<p>I’ve decided to make these updates public, for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve gotten feedback that these weekly updates are interesting and
valuable (and therefore worth lowering my usual bar of quality to push
out a larger volume of writing).</li>
<li>Lots of folks who are not friends or family have asked to join the
mailing list.</li>
<li>I thought I would end up posting a lot of things to a friends and
family audience that I wouldn’t otherwise post to the internet, but
actually that hasn’t been the case at all.</li>
<li>I would like to turn up the “fortuitous encounters” dial to see what
happens.</li>
<li>I’d promised to condense the weekly updates into public monthly
updates, and found trying to summarize them an uninteresting use of
time.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find these startup updates under the <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/tags/cartesian_tutor/">Cartesian Tutor tag</a>, backdated
to their original private posting dates.</p>
