In May, Epstein testified his neighbour held up a handheld drill and said: “You fucking crazy neighbour; you dipshit,” adding: “You’re fucking dead.”</p><p>In response, Epstein told him to “fuck off” and proceeded to give Naccache the finger as he walked away, court documents showed. Video evidence, taken from CCTV footage, “clearly shows that Epstein is looking in the complainant’s direction and giving him the finger, sometimes with both hands”.</p><p>Later that day, Epstein returned home to find police officers waiting for him. They arrested him for uttering death threats.</p><p>Galiatsatos’s view, however, was that “being told to ‘fuck off’ should not prompt a call to 911”.</p><p>The judge said: “The complainants are free to clutch their pearls in the face of such an insult. However, the police department and the 911 dispatching service have more important priorities to address.” he said.</p><p>The middle finger gesture, Galiatsatos ruled, “may not be civil, it may not be polite, it may not be gentlemanly … Nevertheless, it does not trigger criminal liability.”</p><p>He added that despite common vernacular, “cases aren’t actually thrown out,” but that in this matter, “the court is inclined to actually take the file and throw it out the window”.</p><p>“Alas,” he said, “the courtrooms of the Montreal courthouse do not have windows.”</p><p><em>Agence France-Presse contributed to this report</em></p></div></div></div>
