    <h1>Acid&#39;s First Convert, Cary Grant: On Edward J. Delaney&#39;s &#34;The Acrobat&#34;</h1>
    
    <div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div data-selection-popover="true"><p>WHEN CARY GRANT was not shooting a film, he went to the Psychiatric Institute of Beverly Hills every Saturday morning in 1959, using the back entrance to avoid being seen. In a small, beige-colored room modestly furnished with easy chairs, a sofa, and a phonograph player, he received five Sandoz LSD pills and a glass of water. Once the mind-altering drug took hold, the Hollywood icon started crying as Dr. Mortimer Hartman guided him through a psychic minefield: his traumatic childhood years in Bristol. The Hollywood icon learned that these painful memories could be repressed for a while, but they could not simply be willed away. LSD was therapeutic in the sense that it enabled him to reframe his traumatic experiences. After many tears, Grantâ€™s catharsis would often culminate in feelings of ecstasy as Hartman played selections from Rachmaninoff and Chopin on the phonograph player. After the LSD psychotherapy session ended, Grant would be driven home by his driver, and as he watched the afternoon traffic go by his car window, he felt serene.</p></div></div></div>
