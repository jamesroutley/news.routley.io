            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Between May 2023 and March 2025, Tract attempted to build a
              venture-backed company to address Britain’s housing crisis by
              improving the planning permission process. After raising a
              £744,000 pre-seed round in April 2024, we explored several
              business models: a site-sourcing tool for developers (Tract
              Source), a free land-appraisal tool for landowners (Attract),
              becoming tech-enabled land promoters ourselves, and finally, an
              AI-powered platform to assist with drafting planning documents
              (Tract Editor).
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite significant technical progress, building tools like Scout
              and the well-received Tract Editor, our journey taught us critical
              lessons from failing to secure a viable, venture-scale business
              model in the British property market. We learned the difficulty of
              selling software into a conservative sector, experienced the
              operational complexities and timelines of land promotion, and
              encountered a low willingness to pay for useful tools.
              Furthermore, we came to understand how the market&#39;s conservatism
              and fragmentation limited its potential for venture-backed
              disruption. After nearly two years without revenue or committed
              paying customers, we realised we lacked a clear path to the
              necessary scale and returns. This prompted the decision to cease
              operations and return capital, sharing our experience as a case
              study.
            </p>
            <p>
              In retrospect, it&#39;s easy to see ways we could have approached
              things differently. This document is a post mortem, explaining
              what happened and why it went wrong. Our aim in writing this is:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Codify and share what we’ve learned for our benefit and
                hopefully others.
              </li>
              <li>Document the story for posterity.</li>
              <li>
                Produce an artifact to explain, if not justify, the time and
                money spent.
              </li>
              <li>Exorcise our demons.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              We want to stress from the start that the ultimate failure of the
              company lies with us. Some issues were within our control and some
              were beyond it. At times, we’ll describe external factors in ways
              that sound negative. This isn’t an attempt to pass blame. We want
              to tell the story as matter-of-factly as possible. Most
              importantly, we’re extremely grateful to everyone who supported us
              over the last couple of years, in money and in time.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Housing in Britain is expensive because getting planning
                permission is difficult.
              </li>
              <li>
                Granting permission takes the median hectare of land from
                £20,000 to £2.4 million - a 139x uplift.
              </li>
              <li>
                If we can reduce the costs and uncertainty of this process by
                any reasonable amount, we can build a business and help solve
                the housing crisis.

                Many young people have had to delay forming families and often
                take poorly paid, insecure jobs that can barely cover rent and
                living costs as the price for living in culturally attractive
                cities. They see opportunity as limited and growth as barely
                perceptible. Meanwhile, older generations sit on housing
                property worth many times what they paid and, stuck in a
                zero-sum mindset, often prioritise the protection of their own
                neighbourhoods over the need to build more homes. Can you blame
                young people who resent older people, and the West’s economic
                system itself, when this is what it offers them?

            <p>
              Housing in Britain is expensive because of artificial supply
              constraints - specifically, the difficulty of obtaining planning
              permission to build more. Planning permission is Britain’s
              regulatory approval that landowners must secure before developing
              land or changing a building&#39;s use. When permission is granted to
              build homes on agricultural land, its value increases dramatically
              (often 140x or more), creating enormous wealth for landowners.
            </p>

            <p>
              This looked like a business opportunity: if we could help more
              sites get planning permission, we could capture some of that
              uplift. The market size looked compelling - billions in Britain
              alone, the political winds seemed favourable, and there seemed to
              be few modern software solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were driven by a mix of moral outrage and technological
              optimism. It seemed absurd that bureaucratic obstacles were
              holding back so much potential value, especially when millions
              were being spent on documentation that could be automated. With
              the rise of LLMs, we believed we could transform this inefficient
              process.

              Tract Source (May 2023 - October 2023)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Strategic land teams are groups within property development
              companies responsible for identifying and acquiring land with
              long-term development potential. They focus on finding sites that
              don’t yet have permission for development but possess
              characteristics that suggest it could be obtained in the future.
              The earlier they can identify and secure control of these sites,
              the greater their competitive advantage and profit potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              This felt like a software-shaped problem and could form the basis
              of a larger platform for planning, moving elsewhere along the
              value chain. When Jamie began working on Tract, this site sourcing
              problem was the first thing he looked at.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some sourcing tools existed, but the popular options seemed poorly
              built: badly designed, built atop untrustworthy data sources, and
              not built around the sourcing workflow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie had ideas to improve the product experience and began
              building them out. He started to lean on industry advisors for
              introductions. He read <em>The Mom Test</em> (more on which later)
              and had dozens of calls with whoever would take them.
            </p>
            <p>
              During these calls, he realised his intuitions about the existing
              products’ problems were correct (“I don’t trust it”, “I need to
              check the numbers, it’s annoying”). This was exciting: he thought
              he was onto something.
            </p>
            <p>
              But he didn’t ask why users tolerated it (“It’s fine”, “Does what
              I need”, “We went with [competitor] because, to be honest, they’re
              nice guys”). It was unlikely whatever he built could be 10-100x
              better at solving this problem without radically changing their
              workflow, which was tough for a solo developer working on savings
              – Henry began helping in his free time from late summer but
              wouldn’t come on full time until mid-December.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jamie also began to find <em>more</em> competitors, some
              well-resourced, all of whom appeared to be competing on price.
              These were already cheap contracts: a few hundred pounds per month
              for a small/medium-sized team. And they were getting cheaper.
            </p>
            <p>
              We concluded that this was a difficult market to sell into, with
              race-to-the-bottom pricing dynamics, and no obvious way to make a
              SaaS tool that helped strategic land teams do site selection so
              well that these factors wouldn’t matter. It was time to pivot.
            </p>

            <h4 id="timeline-tract-source-learnings">Learnings</h4>
            <p>This process gave us:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                a better understanding of the problem space and competitive
                environment;
              </li>
              <li>the basis of a network;</li>
              <li>
                and time in which the early data infrastructure which would
                support our subsequent products was built.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              However, it took <strong>too long</strong> to reach the pivot
              point. A more thorough competitor analysis would have revealed the
              market problems earlier, rather than being distracted by writing
              code. None of what we needed to learn required writing code to get
              there.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest lesson here:
              <strong>getting time-to-validation as low as possible matters more than
                anything else</strong>. If there are ways faster to get there, you should take them.
            </p>

              Interlude: Attract (October 2023 - November 2023)
            </h3>
            <p>
              Our site appraisal tool, Attract, emerged from discussions with
              our design partner Paul and from Tract Source&#39;s challenges. The
              concept was simple but promising: instead of selling land
              information to developers, we’d provide it to landowners for free.
              The greatest constraint for any promoter or developer is access to
              developable land, so we imagined a tool encouraging landowners to
              reveal their openness to development would be valuable. The
              generated appraisals would allow us to rapidly qualify sites and
              identify potential opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially, we considered selling this tool to developers and land
              promoters seeking strategic land opportunities. However, we
              quickly recognised two fatal flaws in this approach:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                The economics didn&#39;t work—we couldn&#39;t charge more than
                £50/month/customer, and there weren’t many customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                We&#39;d face the same sales challenges as Tract Source, compounded
                by the fact that this was an unconventional solution with no
                market precedents.

              Despite this, Jamie completed the conversion work and launched a
              white-labelled version on Paul’s company’s website in early
              November. It delivered impressive results: he received more
              submissions and higher-quality leads. This quick win validated our
              technical approach, but the underlying business model remained
              insufficient to build our company.

              This experience taught us something valuable: we could create
              genuinely useful tools that solved real problems. However, we
              still hadn&#39;t cracked how to transform that utility into a
              venture-scale business model.

            <p>
              With the white-labelled version of Attract online, we entered a
              period of exploration and uncertainty. We had a call with a major
              surveyor where we showed them a mocked-up tool for writing a
              planning application using an LLM and the information about a site
              in our database. But after the demo, we were ghosted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Market concerns loomed large. The pricing dynamics made us
              question our ability to raise capital with our current approach.
              In retrospect, we may have been closer to viable products than we
              realised. Multiple British prop-tech companies have been funded,
              including in the US, during the lifetime, suggesting alternative
              paths we could have taken.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite challenges, we continued experimenting. In December, we
              created a ‘Tinder for Buildings’ demo with inpainting models that
              received positive feedback. We continued scoping ways to build a
              business on our planning data work. We were awarded an
              <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/02/emergent-ventures-winners-32nd-cohort.html" target="_blank">Emergent Ventures grant</a>, validating our mission if not our approach.

            <h3 id="timeline-jan-2024-may-2024">January 2024 - May 2024</h3>
            <p>
              In January, we began fundraising while working on extracting Local
              Planning Authority validation checklists—technical work to support
              our evolving vision.
            </p>
            <p>
              A February visit to a developer proved illuminating, though not as
              hoped. Their skeptical in-house planner admitted: &#34;To be honest,
              the system being broken helps us.&#34; This comment crystallised a
              tension in our market: many established players benefited from the
              inefficiencies we aimed to solve.
            </p>
            <p>
              This realisation prompted us to revisit our fundamental problem
              statement. The facts were compelling: land with planning
              permission becomes dramatically more valuable, and this value
              creation stems from the friction and uncertainty in the planning
              process—friction that good software could reduce.
            </p>
            <p>
              We faced a dilemma. Selling software into this market would be
              tough, and it seemed wasteful to capture only a small slice of the
              value we could create. If we could facilitate 100x value increases
              in land, why sell this capability to others for modest SaaS fees?
              What B2B model could compete with capturing that uplift directly?
            </p>
            <p>
              We considered a radical pivot: becoming land promoters ourselves.
              We’d partner with landowners or acquire land, secure planning
              permission using our technology, and sell with permission
              granted—capturing the value uplift directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              We found another opportunity: promotion costs don&#39;t scale linearly
              with site size, making many smaller sites economically unviable
              for traditional promoters. We could counterposition by targeting
              these ignored sites and sell them to SME developers.
            </p>
            <p>This model offered significant advantages:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>We avoided selling software to a resistant market.</li>
              <li>
                The potential revenue and profit margins were substantial,
                especially if we could reduce costs through automation.
              </li>
              <li>
                We had a clear technological roadmap: automate the existing site
                selection and planning application processes.
              </li>
              <li>
                As our own customer, we could optimise an industry that
                underutilised modern technology.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Implementation would be challenging—some aspects like site visits
              couldn&#39;t be fully automated—but we believed we could create a
              durable advantage by controlling the critical fulcrum point where
              planning permission is granted.
            </p>
            <p>This became our fundraising narrative:</p>

            </figure>

            <p>
              During the fundraising process however, we identified a
              bottleneck: access to land. Without reliable land access, our
              growth would be constrained. How would we:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>put ourselves in front of landowners,</li>
              <li>identify the ones open to selling,</li>
              <li>get them over the line?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              One investor – who ultimately passed – described this challenge as
              requiring extensive &#34;hand-cranking&#34;—an apt analogy. But at the
              time, we thought Attract could solve our top of funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              Rather than white-labelling the tool for strategic land teams, we
              could own it, market aggressively to landowners, keep the sites we
              want to develop ourselves and pass the rest to strategic land
              teams for a referral fee. Appraising land and advising on its
              development potential is part of what a land agent does. We would
              be automating that.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why would a landowner use our tool? Partly out of curiosity like
              taking personality quizzes, but also because our information was
              genuinely useful. Land agents bill hundreds of pounds for
              appraisals with the same information we could pull
              programmatically. Henry had recently commissioned two appraisals
              for sites following advice his family had received. They were £600
              each and contained:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                A summary of planning constraints for the site (e.g.
                conservation areas, nearby listed buildings, where the village
                sat in the settlement hierarchy).
              </li>
              <li>
                Relevant local plan policies (e.g. what development to
                encourage/discourage).
              </li>
              <li>Previous planning applications for the site.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We already had this information or plans to collect it. We could
              generate these appraisals, give them to landowners for free, and
              use this to solve the top-of-the-funnel problem.
            </p>

            <p>
              We made a subtle but critical error here - we assumed the problem
              was limited to the top of our funnel (identifying landowners and
              sites). In reality, as we&#39;d discover, no part of the funnel was
              robust enough to build a venture-scale business in our required
              timeframe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Had we recognised this earlier, we might have concluded this
              business lacked venture-scale potential, or we could have examined
              how to modify our approach.
            </p>

            <p>
              We still agree with the principle behind this pivot; that the next
              generation of billion-dollar companies may
              <a href="https://www.sarahtavel.com/p/ai-startups-sell-work-not-software" target="_blank">sell work</a>, not just software, and that this is especially true in UK
              proptech. We’re happy with the reasoning. But we were entering an
              industry to do something we had no experience in, and without any
              commercial traction.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paul Graham has an essay where he says the most efficient question
              to ask founders is “What have you learnt from users?”. One problem
              this question would have exposed if we’d asked it was that we
              hadn’t spoken to the people using Attract and who would develop
              their land with us. The people we were speaking to and learning
              about planning and development from weren’t our actual users. This
              meant we couldn’t begin testing our product’s commercial traction
              by asking if a user would pay for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we erred by not getting relevant user feedback while we
              had months of savings, the focus in the latter part of the raise
              to build a business plan was probably correct. We were working on
              Tract unpaid. As the deadline to raise money approached, our focus
              was (not unreasonably) on getting the funding to survive.
            </p>
            <p>
              These weeks were a success: we raised capital in a tough situation
              when the alternative was to shut down and get jobs. However, we
              had backed ourselves into a corner, not taking advantage of the
              previous time to run a rigorous market and product-discovery
              process.

              The Fundraise (January 2024 - April 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              Since raising capital, we&#39;ve learned our fundraising experience
              was unusual. VCs operate with a fundamental asymmetry: it costs
              them virtually nothing to stay in touch with a company without
              investing, but missing the next unicorn can be catastrophic to
              their portfolio returns. This creates a dynamic where they&#39;ll meet
              hundreds of companies annually, rarely delivering outright
              rejections.
            </p>

            <p>
              Contrary to the &#34;VCs never say no&#34; stereotype, most were capable
              of clear passes: &#34;not a market we know enough about&#34; or &#34;we&#39;re not
              convinced about this aspect of the pitch.&#34; The key insight is
              this: if a VC sees potential, they move quickly. If you&#39;re stuck
              in a holding pattern of positive but non-committal feedback, their
              current position is likely &#34;no&#34;—they&#39;re leaving the door open in
              case you gain traction or pivot to something more compelling.
            </p>

            <p>
              We found ourselves in this holding pattern. One VC was interested
              but nervous about leading the round, while at another, the lead
              partner wanted to write an angel check but wouldn&#39;t commit to
              funding institutionally. This created a frustrating cycle of
              meetings yielding positive feedback followed by requests for &#34;just
              one more&#34; spreadsheet or one-pager to clarify something. During
              this period, we worked to integrate early Attract usage data into
              our narrative about targeting small sites as land promoters.
            </p>

            <p>
              Through delicate back-channeling between the two firms, we got
              them as joint leads, with five angels joining the round. We then
              experienced that classic founder moment where, after securing a
              term sheet, several other firms expressed interest.
            </p>

            <p>
              The process from term sheet to closing took over a month. Despite
              being a straightforward priced round, we had to pay both teams
              lawyers to negotiate minor details. In San Francisco, a deal this
              size would have been done with a quick SAFE note, so it was
              frustrating to spend £25,000 out of the £744,000 we raised on
              legal fees.

              <strong>Warm intros are 100x better than cold outreach</strong> -
              maybe one or two VCs set up calls from a cold email, out of ~50,
              whereas nearly every warm intro was happy to talk to us. These
              came from former colleagues who became investors or had startups
              and introduced us to their VCs. People want to make and receive
              introductions. So, assuming you make a good impression, feel free
              to ask for help. If they don’t feel comfortable (maybe they don’t
              they don’t feel comfortable (maybe they don’t know the person
              well, or they’ve recently taken up a lot of their time, or they’re
              busy) they will politely explain why.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Running a well-organised raise is better than not, but you
                can’t really plan it.</strong>
              Unless you have hockey-stick growth and a surplus of investor
              interest, you need to work whichever angle you have, even if it
              means abandoning your existing plans.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Try to raise early rounds on a SAFE/ASA</strong> - even in
              tranches, even if it means accepting less cash or a lower
              valuation, even if it complicates your cap table. Despite capping
              legal fees at each stage, we spent £25,000 on lawyers – capital
              that should have gone toward building our business. We waited over
              a month for the money and were distracted figuring out legal
              terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Not every business suits VC</strong> - If you’re
              interested in technology or startups, you’ll hear lots from
              venture capitalists. This is partly because they engage in content
              marketing and thought leadership to attract dealflow and partly
              because being a VC requires optimism and interest in the future.
              So their interests will overlap with yours as a startup founder.
              But before you raise money from them, consider if your business
              fits their financing model. Venture investments follow a power law
              model. Venture investments follow a power law where a few pay off
              so well that they cover the others that go to ~zero.
            </p>

            <p>
              A good pitch to a VC should acknowledge the risks of the company
              failing, but not eliminate them. The focus should be on the huge
              opportunity if you overcome them. For decades, software companies
              fit this model. There’s a risky startup stage,but if a company
              survives, they can build moats through network effects (the most
              useful platform is the most popular) and switching costs
              (migrating data and workflows to a new system is hard).
            </p>

            <p>
              Not every business is like this. In real estate, you may have a
              thesis about where demand is going. You may make speculative
              acquisitions or invest in site improvements before selling. It’s
              unlikely these bets will pay off 100 to 1000x like the best
              venture investments. However, a good thesis and execution can
              generate an internal rate of return of 10 to 20% - more than
              keeping pace with a VC fund’s aggregate return. There are
              investors interested in these opportunities but they make less
              noise than VCs. They are often family offices, and may be the LPs
              of venture funds.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some companies try to balance being a high-risk bet with high per
              deal costs by raising money from VCs for an operating company and
              property investors for a property company. The former bet on the
              company growing to process many deals,while the latter bet on the
              success rate of those deals. These complex deals require careful
              alignment of everyone’s incentives.

              April to November 2024
            </h3>

            <p>
              Marketing to landowners proved difficult. An appraisal tool for
              farmers doesn&#39;t go viral. We identified things like niche Google
              searches e.g. specific DEFRA forms with low ad competition, but a
              few thousand pounds of ad spend generated minimal activity.
            </p>

            <p>
              The challenge: landowners might pay hundreds for an appraisal, but
              rarely need one. Identifying and reaching them at their moment of
              need was nearly impossible.
            </p>

            <p>We made two critical mistakes:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                We spent three months rebuilding the Appraisal tool before
                contacting landowners who had submitted sites through our MVP.
                These existing submissions represented our only real users, yet
                we failed to nurture these relationships or learn from them
                immediately. We didn&#39;t take them seriously enough as potential
                customers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Second, we failed to understand the basic economics of land
                agency—the business we were trying to replace. When we spoke
                with established land agents, we discovered uncomfortable
                truths: they completed very few referrals, and each took 18-24
                months minimum to process.
              </li>
            </ol>

            

            <p>
              Land agents are fragmented: many serve small geographic areas. A
              birds-eye view of this market suggests you can roll it up for
              economies of scale. We liked this logic, so we pursued it.
            </p>

            <p>
              We didn’t consider if the fragmentation was a feature rather than
              a bug. Each agent spends a lot of time building the social
              infrastructure – going to fairs, drinking in pubs, befriending the
              parish council – needed for these deals. Landowners are a small-c
              conservative customer, and they don’t respond well to audacious
              pitches and fast timetables. These deals take 18-24 months because
              these are emotional decisions, not scalable ones.
            </p>

            <p>
              Two or three phone calls could have revealed this reality and
              neutered any delusions about revolutionising this industry.
              Instead, we wasted six months—three building software and three
              wondering why nobody used it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Compounding these errors, we hired extra marketing and operations
              staff based on flawed assumptions:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                We had no evidence that more marketing would help without a
                proven customer acquisition strategy;
              </li>
              <li>
                We weren&#39;t constrained enough to justify these hires—we should
                have pushed ourselves harder first.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              We found a few promising sites where the landowner was eager to
              collaborate. However, further investigation revealed unique
              complications that would require bespoke work taking months to
              resolve before we even got onto the steps we aspired to automate.
              This wasn’t a deal breaker, but it would mean using nearly all our
              capital to bet on four sites over the next couple of years. If we
              got them through the system, we could make enough money to repeat
              the process at a greater scale. However, it was also possible that
              we wouldn’t. We would have spent two years working as conventional
              land promoters, which others could do better.
            </p>

            <p>
              As we considered the sites we had and ways to increase
              submissions, we explored higher leverage ways to use our skills.
              What was our comparative advantage? We could build software. So we
              dove back into the murky world of pure proptech.

              Interlude: The Grid (December 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              The state of our electricity grid is an important story. Whenever
              we met a developer, residential, commercial, or energy, the
              uncertainty about how long they would be stuck in the
              interconnection queue and how much they might pay in first or
              second comer charges would come up. Delays or unexpected charges
              could run into the millions.
            </p>

            <p>
              We lack good tools for modelling the grid. At the time of writing
              the
              <a href="https://www.neso.energy/publications/beyond-2030/web-map" target="_blank">National Energy System Operator’s map</a>
              thinks that Didcot is on the Isle of Wight, and Sizewell B is in
              Scotland. If you want to build something that will draw from or
              inject significant power into the grid, you need to know:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>What is the current capacity around your proposed site?</li>
              <li>What will the capacity be in the next few years?</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              We already had a map with layers like power line and substation
              locations, voltages, and official headroom capacity.
            </p>

            <p>
              DNOs publish their actual headroom monthly in tables called the
              embedded capacity register. It wouldn’t be hard to add that.
            </p>

            <p>
              We were scraping planning applications to build a model of future
              generation and demand growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              At the year’s end, we explored whether this was a worthwhile pivot
              opportunity. We found a couple of developers who hired
              consultancies to build internal tools at great expense. We found a
              couple of start-ups whose demos didn’t justify the huge prices for
              features on our roadmap. We had exciting conversations with one
              energy developer about a design partnership. They wanted a
              platform to find companies in the connection queue open to selling
              their spot.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our idea was speculative, requiring us to negotiate deals in an
              unfamiliar industry. Meanwhile, we were making progress with the
              Editor project. So we shelved this idea.
            </p>

            

            <h3 id="timeline-scout-december-2024">
              Interlude: Scout (December 2024)
            </h3>

            <p>
              While attempting to build a land promoter, we started using
              Landstack, a site sourcing tool, with good quality datasets that
              we hadn’t ingested. We had no desire to compete with them or steal
              their data. We made the mistake of asking for API access. They saw
              this as a red flag, investigated us, realised we were technical,
              and booted us off the platform. So we needed a replacement.
            </p>

            <p>
              We decided to build it ourselves. We had all the needed
              components: data ingestion and map layers. It took about one
              developer-week to create the first version.
            </p>

            <p>
              Why not release it? Allowing people to explore our data might:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>encourage inbound traffic;</li>
              <li>
                crowdsource the debugging and interrogation of our data for
                internal use;
              </li>
              <li>
                and help test the interface for a grid capacity discovery
                product, if we pursued that.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>We launched the tool, called Scout, shortly before Christmas.</p>

            </figure>

            <p>
              Scout did well, with a few hundred visitors, some acclaim on
              Twitter and LinkedIn, and emails and comments thanking us for it;
              it was our most-used product.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’d like to think we caused a stressful Christmas at Landstack,
              <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/landstack_landstacklite-propertydevelopment-landdevelopment-activity-7294691823971696640-AyF7" target="_blank">who released Landstack Lite</a>, a free version, in early February.

            <p>
              Scout was our most-used product. Its users weren’t our target
              market, but some were. We had vague ambitions to use it as an
              inbound marketing tool, but we never capitalised on it. This was a
              missed opportunity.
            </p>

            <p>
              There was some accidental product-market fit. We found an organic
              audience for our side project; making our data free and easy to
              access provided genuine value.
            </p>

              Tract Editor (December 2024 - March 2025)
            </h3>

            <p>
              During the same tech sprint that produced Scout, we started
              considering reviving the planning applications platform.
            </p>

            <p>
              We had all this information in our database – most required for
              the desk reports for planning applications – but were only using
              it for appraisals. To drive down the cost of planning
              applications, we needed to automate as much of the process as
              possible, including writing these reports.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since we abandoned the idea of doing property development
              ourselves, we considered selling the tool directly. Many US
              startups help draft documents in development and construction, so
              there was some precedent.
            </p>

            <p>
              A demo came together quickly. We dumped our appraisal output into
              a JSON blob. We parsed policies from an LPA&#39;s local plan. We built
              a document editor using open source components. We chained LLM
              prompts with our planning information – and got good results. A
              vision for this product began to form. We&#39;d sell an LLM wrapper to
              planning consultants and developers to speed up document drafting.
              Then we&#39;d expand to become the platform for managing all their
              projects, each with dozens of documents - hundreds with revisions.
              Hundreds of thousands of planning applications are submitted
              yearly, but no tool captures the institutional knowledge that
              compounds from project to project.
            </p>

            <p>
              This felt promising. It played to our strengths as software
              developers. There was a sales playbook we could follow and our
              investors would understand for the next round. Preliminary
              discussions suggested the market was more open to our product:
              even planners realised they needed an answer to the AI question.
            </p>

            <p>
              There was also a path to apply our technology to the US market,
              particularly California, which has its own housing crisis and
              legal hurdles.
            </p>

            <p>
              We could build tools to help people navigate applications like lot
              subdivisions or rezoning petitions, or a tool for searching trial
              court rulings. Developers sometimes sue the city council, and
              these rulings don’t automatically become planning policy like
              Planning Inspectorate rulings in England, but they’re useful.
              Developers pay land use attorneys a lot of money to research them.
              Or we could help multijurisdictional landlords keep up with
              different regulations.
            </p>

            <p>
              The common thread was our ability to ingest large numbers of
              documents, map their content onto a geospatial layer, and ask
              meaningful questions. Our technical foundation could support
              multiple business models in the UK and US.
            </p>

            <p>
              Expanding internationally would require significant resources and
              market knowledge. We decided to focus on validating our core
              product with UK customers before pursuing US opportunities.
            </p>

            

            <h4>Setting up design partnerships</h4>

            <p>
              Towards the end of 2024, we set up calls with several planning
              consultants. We asked about their workflows and what tools. We
              described our vision and showed them our demo. The responses were
              all positive.
            </p>

            <h4>Narrowing focus to pre-app letters</h4>

            <figure>

                </figcaption>
              </a>
            </figure>

            <p>
              After a month of calls and building, we realised our product was
              too general-purpose. We needed to focus on a specific problem. We
              had little evidence of selling this software and wanted a clear
              use-case to ground our offering.
            </p>

            <p>
              We focused on pre-app statements. Most local authorities ask major
              developments to get pre-application advice: feedback on an initial
              proposal before submission, to ensure the basics are solid. It was
              the simplest document we saw. Most applications go through pre-app
              first – about 80%, according to one customer – it’s usually step
              one. We knew the costs and timelines, so we could anchor the
              pricing. And we had most of the information to generate them.
            </p>

            <p>
              This led to a product called Tract Editor. Users would draw their
              site boundaries on a map, and we would pull existing site
              information. We could generate and reuse our appraisal output, so
              this was easy. We could pass this information into an LLM to
              produce a first-draft pre-app statement.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’d add normal document editor features – comments, versioning,
              WYSIWYG, etc. – to integrate it into their workflow and avoid
              needing a perfect first draft. It could get you a reasonable
              starting point, like a junior planning consultant, which you could
              refine in a familiar environment.
            </p>

            <p>
              We built a good tool that produced compelling first drafts from
              minimal information. It had a smart Q&amp;A UI allowing the model to
              ask the user questions and regenerate sections based on the
              answers. It treated the planning system as a first-class citizen
              of the document editor, rather than focusing on the AI. It cited
              its sources and provided references for the quoted planning
              policy.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our design partners seemed happy. We had made a marketing website
              and received good feedback from industry people. We chose a price
              of £99/user/month. We were ready to start selling.
            </p>

              Learnings
            </h4>

            <p>
              By this stage, we knew to talk to customers before, during, and
              after building a demo, and we didn’t spend too much time coding
              before getting positive feedback. What we did wrong was assume
              ‘positive feedback’ meant ‘desire to purchase’.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Customer switching costs have a psychological as well as
                economic logic.</strong>
              Better alone doesn’t mean people will use it. You’re competing
              with another workflow plus any status quo bias, which can be
              significant.

              When we offered a 50% discount to our design partners and asked
              what would get them to commit, their response was telling. Despite
              positive feedback, they wanted significant additional features
              like full planning statements before signing. This forced us to
              confront several hard truths:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Despite positive feedback, customers weren&#39;t ready to commit,
                even with steep discounts.
              </li>
              <li>
                After nearly two years, we had zero revenue to show for our
                efforts. (We clearly weren’t great at this!)
              </li>
              <li>
                Our opportunity cost was rising as the tech landscape evolved
                rapidly.
              </li>
              <li>
                While we might build a business that could support us, we
                couldn&#39;t see a path to the venture-scale returns our investors
                deserved.
              </li>
              <li>
                The British market was too small, fragmented, and resistant to
                change for us to progress at the speed and scale our investors
                required.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              Any one of these challenges could have been addressed. But
              collectively, they showed we faced months of struggling to secure
              small revenues through manual sales processes in a market with no
              clear path to venture-scale growth.
            </p>

            <p>
              We considered pivoting to the US and drastically reducing our burn
              rate. Ultimately, we chose to return the remaining capital to our
              investors and walk away.

            <p>
              We raised capital for an unconventional business model in a
              challenging sector. In a difficult fundraising environment, we
              secured funding from institutional investors and angels who
              believed in our vision to transform the British housing market.
              This is no small feat for a pre-revenue company in an industry not
              known for technological innovation.

                Our data infrastructure effectively ingested and processed
                complex planning and geographic information.

              <li>
                Scout became a useful tool with recurring users and positive
                feedback.
              </li>
              <li>
                Our Appraisals product was fast, well-designed, and provided
                useful information for its hundreds of users.

              <li>
                Tract Editor produced high-quality planning document drafts that

            <p>
              These products were built upon useful primitives that enabled
              quick experimentation.

            <p>
              When we recognised our land promotion strategy wasn’t working, we
              decided to pivot quickly. We parted ways with the non-technical
              employees not involved in building Tract Editor. We found design
              partners enthusiastic about our product and committed to giving us
              feedback, while keeping our investors informed about our strategic
              shift.

              Closing Down
            </h4>

            <p>
              There are many ways in which we wasted time and money. But we are
              proud of the fact that we closed down the company because we
              couldn&#39;t see a way to make it work for our investors, and I think
              we can all sleep well knowing that we made the right call.

            </h4>

            <p>
              We developed valuable relationships. From planning consultants to
              developers to land agents, we built a network that provided
              insights, feedback, and opportunities that would have been
              invaluable had the business continued.
            </p>

            <p>
              We knew little about planning before this. But learned enough to
              build something that impressed the industry experts. This isn’t a
              complete win - we didn’t convert them to paying users. But they
              took us seriously. That’s not something we were certain we’d
              manage at the outset and gives us confidence moving forward.
            </p>

            <h3 id="reflections-reasonable-errors">Reasonable Errors</h3>

            <p>
              By &#39;reasonable&#39;, we mean mistakes that were understandable given
              the available information and our natural inclinations as
              founders.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our technical and product execution was strong. Our ultimate
              challenges were market selection, business model fit, and the
              British planning system’s dynamics rather than our ability to
              build useful technology.
            </p>

            </h4>

            <p>
              The British proptech and planning market seemed substantial, given
              the dramatic land value increases from planning permission. There
              seemed to be a venture-scale opportunity, especially as several
              British proptech companies secured funding during our journey.

            <p>
              If our software could help many sites secure planning permission,
              it made sense to capture as much of that value as possible. But we
              underestimated the uniqueness of each site’s challenges and the
              “hand-cranking” needed to get landowners over the line. The way to
              run a business like this is to use off-the-shelf tools and raise
              money from institutions seeking a less risky 10 to 20% IRR.

              Focusing on technology over business development
            </h4>

            <p>
              As technically-oriented founders, we gravitated toward building
              solutions. When faced with challenges, our impulse was to solve
              them with better technology rather than rethink our market
              approach. This technical optimism is common among founders with
              our background and was reinforced by the emergence of powerful new
              AI tools.
            </p>

            <h4 id="reflections-building-a-team-too-early">
              Building a team too early
            </h4>

            <p>
              Conventional startup wisdom encourages bringing on talent to
              accelerate growth. With funding secured and ambitious goals,
              adding team members seemed logical.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is a classic startup dilemma: you need people to build and
              sell your product, but adding headcount increases burn rate and
              creates complexity before validating your revenue model. The error
              wasn&#39;t in hiring - many successful startups scaled their teams
              pre-revenue - but rather that we didn&#39;t have a clear hypothesis
              about how these hires would validate our core assumptions.
            </p>

            <p>
              There&#39;s no perfect formula here. Too little hiring can mean missed
              opportunities and founder burnout; too much creates financial
              pressure and overhead. Our mistake was not ensuring each hire was
              tightly coupled to the critical path to revenue.
            </p>

            <h4 id="reflections-not-entering-the-us-market">
              Not entering the US market
            </h4>

            <p>
              This might have offered more opportunities. Many VC-backed
              proptech companies founded before and during Tract’s lifetime
              (e.g. LandTech, SchemeFlow, PermitPortal) expanded to the US. Land
              use and zoning varies across US states, but traction in one may
              have been enough to raise the money to fund others.
            </p>

            <p>
              But our challenge was understanding users deeply enough to build
              something they&#39;d pay for. If we struggled in our home market with
              networks and cultural understanding, it&#39;s not obvious we&#39;d have
              fared better in the US.

            <p>
              The US is the largest and most dynamic market. Even niche
              industries are large enough for venture-scale companies to exist.
              This is rarer in Britain.
            </p>

            <p>
              If your value proposition is built around saving labour costs or
              augmenting productivity, Britain’s lower median salaries are a
              ceiling on both the value you can create and the portion you can
              capture as a vendor.

              Prioritise finding users in America if you want to raise money

            <p>
              Consider the market size, but also assess how receptive your
              target users are to new products and workflows. Questions to ask:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Does the market have early adopters willing to try new
                solutions, or is it dominated by late majority/laggard customers
                who wait for proven technologies?
              </li>
              <li>
                Can you easily identify and access decision-makers? Markets with
                clear purchasing authority and shorter sales cycles allow faster
                iteration and learning.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do potential customers engage with product demos, respond
                promptly to communication, and provide actionable feedback?
              </li>
              <li>
                Are there self-contained pain points you can start selling a
                solution for, or a long tail of features customers need before
                they’ll pay?
              </li>
              <li>
                Is the customer base concentrated enough to build momentum
                through reference customers, or so diffuse that each sale
                requires starting from scratch?
              </li>

              We hired too soon, rented an office, and spent money on
              branding/design before having a clear revenue route. Money gives
              you more latitude, which means more opportunities to avoid
              necessary actions.

              We focussed too much on building a theoretically sound business
              model and too little on testing it in the market. If we had asked
              “what have we learnt from users?” throughout 2024, it would have
              exposed that very little informing our product decisions came from
              conversations with our target market. Get traction with your
              target users before raising money.

              We were distracted by Tract’s potential to help solve the housing
              crisis. But since we never made any money, we couldn’t keep going,
              making it irrelevant. It’s great to have a mission beyond making
              money. But if it doesn’t contribute to making your business
              sustainable, it will need to take a back seat for a few years.

              flawed. For instance, it took too long to realise referring sites
              to developers through Attract wasn’t an easy way to get short-term
              revenue. We knew people who did referrals on the side and how the
              process worked but never drilled down into how long it took and
              what made the conversations drag on.

            <p>
              I&#39;m spending the next few weeks writing and attending to life
              admin. I&#39;m tempted by the thought of another startup while the
              lessons from the last one are fresh. I&#39;m giving thought to ways I
              can be useful before committing to the next path. Some things I&#39;m
              interested in:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Buildings and urbanism.</strong> Similar to Tract&#39;s
                mission. I&#39;m cautiously optimistic that we are going to increase
                the rate of building in the next few years in the places where
                it is most needed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>I&#39;m increasingly concerned by our shrinking industrial
                  base. </strong>
                In Britain, I think high energy costs are a major factor. And in
                both Europe and America I&#39;m worried about what we can rely on if
                relations with China worsen.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AI.</strong> Obviously the biggest story this decade the
                area in which I have the most professional experience.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>I&#39;m open to relocating to the US.</p>

            <h3 id="things-that-should-exist">Things that should exist</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Appeals and planning apps search.</strong> The industry
                leader,
                <a href="https://www.compasssearch.co.uk/CompassOnline/homeout" target="_blank">COMPASS</a>, is overpriced and

                semantic search (“give me every planning application in this
                borough within the last decade that was rejected because of a
                disagreement about materials”) could be a nice product.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>An accurate grid capacity map and trading platform.</strong>
                See Interlude: The Grid above.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>Better industry-specific content.</strong> Most planning
                media is rubbish; an LLM could do just as good a job; thoughtful
                humans could do much better (<a href="https://gwern.net/matt-levine" target="_blank">who’s the Matt Levine of planning?</a>).
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>LLM-powered web scraping.</strong> Frameworks like
                <a href="https://scrapy.org/" target="_blank">scrapy</a> and its
                <a href="http://scrapeops.io/" target="_blank">long</a>
                <a href="https://www.zyte.com/" target="_blank">tail</a>
                of

                <a href="https://scrape.do/" target="_blank">services</a>
                are valuable, but many use cases need more intelligence, which
                modern LLMs could provide.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>A tech-enabled land promoter.</strong>
                We still think somebody should do this – just not via VC funding
                – but there are ways to reduce planning application costs and
                make this business work.
              </li>
